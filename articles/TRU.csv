It's also prominent in international credit reporting, serving customers in approximately 30 countries around the world.From a fundamental perspective, TransUnion has performed very well over the last few years, and up until this recent pullback in the overall market, the stock was performing well too. Over the last few months, the company saw its stock drop by almost half from its February high. Investors are likely concerned about the economy slowing due to the coronavirus shutdown and whether TransUnion will be able to maintain the growth levels it has posted over the last few years.The company has seen its earnings grow by 24% per year over the last three years, and they grew by 14% in the fourth quarter. The company is set to report Q1 2020 results toward the end of April. Analysts are looking for earnings growth of 16.7% for the quarter and 14% for the year.TransUnion's revenue has grown by 17% per year over the last three years, and it grew by 12% in the fourth quarter. Analysts are looking for revenue to grow by 10.2% for the first quarter and by 7.8% for 2020 as a whole.The return on equity for the company is at 25.9%, and that is well above average. The profit margin is also well above average at 27.9%. The current P/E ratio is just over 23, and that is higher than average right now.I have been watching TransUnion's chart for a few months, and the reason the stock was on my radar in the first place was due to the fundamental indicators laid out above. Now, that the stock has fallen, the chart looks as if there is a buying opportunity at hand.TransUnion peaked at $101.07 back on February 19 and that was the same day that the S&P peaked. From that day through the low on March 23, the stock fell 48% from the high. The low on March 23 was $52.50 and that is a price range that stood out on the weekly chart. The December '18 low was at $51.89 and the opening price that week was $52.49. The same price area served as a low in February '18 when the stock had a temporary pullback to $52.67.Looking at the weekly overbought/oversold indicators for TransUnion, we see that both the 10-week RSI and the weekly stochastic indicators were in oversold territory last week. Going back to the stock's IPO date of 6/25/2015, there have only been four instances where both indicators were in oversold territory at the same time - the current one, two instances in the fourth quarter of 2018, and in February 2016.In 2016, the stock rallied over 65% in approximately five months. When the oscillators were in oversold territory in October '18, the stock did drift approximately 18% lower until eventually bottoming in December. From the December '18 instance, where the RSI and stochastics were both in oversold territory, the stock rallied over 50% in the next seven months.With TransUnion's fundamental indicators as strong as they are, I expected to see the sentiment indicators skewed toward the bullish side. When I pulled up the overall analysts' ratings and the short interest ratio, they weren't as skewed to the bullish camp as I expected. There are 18 analysts covering the stock at this time with 12 ""buy"" ratings, five ""hold"" ratings, and one ""sell"" rating. This puts the buy percentage at 66.7%, and that falls toward the bottom part of the average range.The current short interest ratio is at 2.3, and that is a little below average and does indicate slightly more bullish sentiment than the average stock. The average short interest ratio is in the 3.0 range.Looking at the sentiment from a contrarian perspective, I normally like to find stocks that have more pessimism than what we see with TransUnion, but the sentiment isn't so bullishly skewed that it should hold the stock back. If the buy percentage was up above 80% and the short interest ratio was below 2.0, I would be a little more concerned.As with any stock right now, there is a certain degree of risks for the company and how the economic downturn could impact its earnings and revenue. For TransUnion, the biggest risk is that companies see a slowdown in credit requests. Two big areas where an economic slowdown could hit TransUnion are the mortgage business and auto loans. If these two areas slow down tremendously around the world, it could mean a big hit to revenues and earnings.Given TransUnion's strong fundamentals and the support in the $52.50 area, I look for the stock to rally in the coming months. I see it rallying at least back up to the $85 range over the next six to nine months.Keeping the concerns mentioned above in mind, I would set a target of $85 on the upside and would suggest a stop at the $50 area. If the stock reaches the upside target, I would reevaluate where the overbought/oversold indicators are, where the sentiment indicators are, and where the long-term moving averages are at that time."

I’ve previously covered two 2017 acquisitions here and here.Management isn’t shy about making what appear to be smaller ‘team and technology’ acquisitions as it tries to improve its risk identification and reduction capabilities.In the past 12 months, the stock has risen at a much faster rate than the overall market, so it looks like investors are rewarding management’s results and moves to improve its offerings.Its most recent report resulted in a 10% stock price increase after management raised full-year guidance and announced a deal to purchase Callcredit in the UK for $1.4 billion.As long as TRU can avoid the disastrous data-breach pitfall of its competitor Equifax (EFX), the stock may have more to run.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

It will need to combine that data with strong machine learning-based real-time analytics to fully realize the value from the acquisition.Sacramento, California-based Datalink was founded in 2001 to provide auto insurers and non-insurance providers with driver pre-screening data and DMV records.Management is headed by President Mark Haddy, who has been with the firm since October 2008 and was previously VP Technology at First Advantage, a human resources screening firm.Compass’ primary offerings include two products with nationwide coverage:Additionally, Compass provides the following capabilities for California only:(Source: Datalink)Neither company disclosed the acquisition price or terms. TransUnion didn’t file an 8-K and didn’t issue any change in forward financial guidance, so the deal appears to have been for a non-material amount.TRU is adding Datalink to its DriverRisk solution, which is aimed primarily at the insurance industry by providing market participants with a range of driver and vehicle data. Notably, the Datalink system also will be marketed to ‘other industries that meet Drivers Privacy Protection Act requirements.’As Mark McElroy, EVP and head of TransUnion’s insurance business unit stated in the deal announcement:The insurance industry has been pushing for, and getting, greater visibility into driver offenses, and increasing risk premia accordingly.LexisNexis’s Risk Solutions unit is a competitive provider of similar data and analytics services to insurers, so with the Datalink buy TransUnion wants to go head-to-head in what appears to be a lucrative market.However, just providing data won’t be enough to compete well. TransUnion will need to marry that data with powerful analytics, ideally using current machine learning technologies to not only provide insight into past behavior, but also adapt to conditions in real-time, and in an automated manner.By combining data with higher-level services and selling those capabilities to insurers and non-insurer institutions, TransUnion will be able to fully realize the value of the Datalink acquisition.So, the deal has much promise, but TransUnion will likely need to invest in a full solution set to compete effectively against the likes of LexisNexis and others.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, and IPOs.

        Innovation and growth are still strong at TRU.
        The group, along with most stocks, look very expensive at all time high valuations.","TransUnion(NYSE:TRU), one of the 3 major credit agencies along with Equifax and Experian, has been a public company since June of 2015.In honor of that one year anniversary I wanted to dive in and learn more about the company, how they make money, what they do beyond just credit scores and reports, and if the stock is worth investing in.ResultsTRU has grown sales at a blistering pace since 2012 when it was purchased by private investors that included Goldman Sachs.Profitability was slow coming though, although the company did eke out a tiny profit in 2015. Operating income looks like it is moving in the right direction along with some noise from non-operating expenses.Let's dive in further and see if we can uncover what is really going on.DebtI hate when I stumble upon an interesting company and start my research, only to discover that the company has been marred by a recent private equity transaction that did little but heap a mountain of debt on the company while enriching the purchasing and subsequently selling shareholders.This picture tells me that the company got another 1 billion in debt for the privilege of changing owners. Sure, the IPO proceeds were used to pay down debt but it is still 600 million higher than it used to be.But Greg, you might say, look at the other things in that chart, assets and SE. In comparison to 2011, everything looks so much better now! Forget about the debt and have a margarita!Are things really better for the company or did the PE guys just put lipstick on a pig?The operating data is interesting. What I see is that the most important segment of the company, USIS, has gone nowhere since 2013. Consumer Interactive has doubled though and it was likely a focus of the previous owners since it is the highest margin business segment. You can see at the bottom it is 36.6% compared to 16.6% for USIS and 7.9% for international in 2015.From a pure balance sheet perspective things are also interesting. For companies that have acquired a lot or been manipulated in some way, I always like to back out goodwill from the assets to get a better sense of what is going on.Remember that Goodwill is nothing, it is not a building or software, just a necessary accounting fiction.Assets not including goodwill are 2463.3 compared to liabilities of 3076.8 for a ratio of .80. Equifax(NYSE:EFX) has a ratio of .89, better but not amazing. Fair enough.Where's The Beef(profit)?The real problem I see with TransUnion comes when we try to answer the question of ""Is the company actually making money?""TransUnion has average gross margins of 62.4% over the past 3 years. I cannot find data going back further than this.The most direct comparison one can use is Equifax, the other US based major credit firm in similar lines of business.Experian is UK based and thus their information is more difficult to compare directly. Equifax had gross margins over the same time frame of 65.9%.But here is the interesting part, TransUnion had a net profit margin of -1.2% over that same time frame while Equifax had a net profit margin of 15.2% averaged over those 3 years.So basically, Equifax made money the past three years and TransUnion did not.Why?One possible explanation is higher Depreciation & Amortization charges. TransUnion had D&A costs of $298 million in 2015 versus $198 for Equifax, despite the fact that TRU is 3 times smaller than Equifax if we go by market cap.Readers will remember that D&A are non cash expenses that can sometimes obscure things to the point that a company looks less profitable but is really generating more cash flow than the net income line would indicate.Another interesting thing is that Equifax has an interest expense equal to about a third of what TRU has, again contrasted with the fact that Equifax is three times larger.Int exp. is 2.4% of revenues for EFX and 8.89% for TRU. Combined with the slightly higher gross margins, you can see where we are going here.ValuationEFX is at 21.5 times forward earnings and TRU at 22.4. Price to sales has TRU cheaper at 3.67 versus 5.11.EFX has grown EPS at 13.8% the last five years and TRU is projected to grow at 12.08% but considering the company is not really profitable, those projections should be taken with a large grain of salt.EFX pays a dividend and TRU does not. EFX has a 5 year div. growth rate of 15.58%.Recent ResultsRecent results paint a much more positive picture than I have outlined talking about the past. In each of the last two quarters TRU has beat expectations on revenue and EPS and looks on pace to have the most profitable year in recent memory, although that is not saying much as you saw above.TRU is doing all the right things and capitalizing on the big data trend. All their US segments are growing 10%+ in revenue with international lagging at 7%.A recent upgrade of all credit agency stocks by Deutsche bank cited increasing mortgage volumes and a weaker dollar. I am in the camp that over the next few years mortgage volumes will fall as the World climbs out of negative rates and the US goes up in rates ever so slowly, even if they only do one a year.Combined with the overheated auto sector loan sector having to come back to reality, I am skeptical about TRU's long term future earnings although this year appears to be on track to be solid.ConclusionWhile TRU is clearly in an uptrend of late, I am not yet convinced. I still think that the other two credit agencies have better operating histories, metrics, and more scale that TRU.That being said, TRU is innovating at a rapid pace and continues to grow fast and leverage their big data in new ways.Yet, I continue to worry that the company is having a breakout year that will not continue and the profitability metrics are still well behind competitors.The group as a whole looks expensive but I would be more than willing to pay TRU's current price, given their growth rate, if only I had more faith.I look forward to continued improvements in TRU so that they can get me over the cliff and convince me to hop aboard their big data train."
3920436,54942,2016-02-24T11:45:34-05:00,"TransUnion is a recent IPO that focuses on the credit risk and consumer risk solutions businesses providing big data analytics to consumers and businesses.We think the company has a superior management team that is ahead of the other two large bureaus in differentiation and growing despite regulatory headwinds.TRU had several growth levers that it is currently pulling including international growth, new product launches, continued vertical penetration, and new verticals.","TransUnion (NYSE:TRU) is the leading provider of risk and information solutions helping businesses optimize their risk-based decisions while enabling customers analytical tools to help manage their personal financial information. It is one of the three largest credit bureaus with a primary function of providing information services to businesses to help them grant credit and market to their customers.The Marmon Group spun off TransUnion in 2005 although it remained private. Several years later, Madison Dearborn Partners, a private equity firm, acquired a majority stake. Just two years later, GS Capital and Advent International acquired it for $3 billion. In June of 2015, they decided that the business was ready for the public market, conducting a $765 million IPO.The credit risk industry is a secular growth theme as more consumers seek credit and alternative financing. TransUnion has key client verticals including financial services with nine of the top 10 banks as clients, top insurance firms, and healthcare. The company has several unique data assets and is nicely positioned to take advantage of high-growth geographical regions such as India, Africa, and Southeast Asia.(Source: Investor Presentation)US Information ServicesTransUnion is unique in the credit risk industry given that it has a comprehensive and distinct data set. The amount of data and the cost of accumulating such a large data set create a sustainable and marketable product. In addition, we think it differentiates the company from other credit and risk analytics businesses. The amount of resources it would require for another to accumulate and re-create such an asset is immense, creating a significant barrier to entry. Many of these types of data assets are rare and can only be purchased on infrequent occasions. In addition, it typically acquires large amounts of data back from its customers and then re-aggregates it through its existing data set and sells back to those companies, creating a virtuous cycle to which new entrants cannot compete.Much of the segment is centered on the online data service providing consumer credit bureau information such as payment data on credit cards, mortgages, home loans, and auto loans for use in financial services, insurance, and the healthcare industries. The remainder of the division includes a credit marketing services business that markets lists of prospects via mail, email, or mobile for the credit and insurance markets. And lastly a decision services platform to automate decisions in real-time while the customer is engaged, opening a new checking account or credit application for example.We believe that the decision services segment is likely to be a near-term growth engine for the segment. The real-time automated decision algorithms allow fast-decision making at the customer engagement level. Companies use this product in order to quickly evaluate business and credit risks and close opportunities in real-time before the customer has a chance to change their minds. Typically, businesses derive a significant amount of high-margin revenue from their financing arms as well as preventing bad debt expenses, namely in their healthcare vertical.We believe the CreditVision product creates a differentiated solution to companies. This is a ""trended risk"" product which uses historical consumer credit behavior to detail credit risk profiles at a more granular level. For instance, it uses algorithms to better understand the differences in two consumers' credit profile that may have the same credit score. While we think the actual product exists at the competition in various other formats, the company has been able to reinvigorate the uses for the product, creating new interest in the space. We think this inventive and imaginative approach is indicative of the company's innovative management culture.Growing The CRA BusinessThe consumer reporting business has been plagued by technology and regulatory disruption over the years by free credit reports and third-party firms (LifeLock, Credit Karma, etc.). But TransUnion has been able to grow much faster than its peers (Equifax (NYSE:EFX) and Experian (OTCQX:EXPGY)) through a different strategy for the consumer-facing market.It has been able to use non-traditional data in order to augment its core consumer credit data, particularly when it comes to thin-file credit-seekers. These are consumers that do not have a long enough credit history to make an accurate assumption. In these cases previously, the consumer would receive an N/A or some variation until more credit history was obtained. But TransUnion's use of alternative data sources such as rental history, gym and other club membership payment, subscriptions, debt, driving records and other public records, etc., allows it to supplant the credit history through its algorithm and make a determination.The company bolstered this segment in 2014 when it acquired L2C, one of the first predictive analytics businesses that used alternative data sources. It also acquired DHI, an insurance risk analytics business later the same year, augmenting its capabilities. TRU was nearly two years ahead of its competition in moving into this space, further emphasizing its innovative management culture and thinking.We think the consumer credit cycle is in an upturn following years of stagnation during and after the financial crisis. Lending standards have loosened considerably in the last few years, which, when combined with very low interest rates, have helped TransUnion inflect organic growth towards 6-7%. Some of the risks of the macro trend reversing or rising interest rates, we think, are overblown. Consumer spending remains tepid and under-cycle average, thus, we think it is already incorporated into the share prices of the credit bureaus. If anything, the risk is to the upside should the macro slowdown reverse and consumer spending pickup.Revenue Growth StrategyWe think the company continues to be ahead of its peers in acquiring unique data sources and services that enhance its product offerings. Through its own R&D efforts along with key inorganic growth moves, we think TransUnion will continue to benefit from innovation in its reporting and predictive scoring utilizing its big data and strong technology platforms. As the company continues to build its technology capabilities, we think it should be able to capture a broader set of data for predictive insight, including from its own product sets (CreditVision).Revenue should also be driven by generating more revenue from existing customers and verticals. We think the company is likely to develop new tools to further penetrate these existing verticals in order to be able to market to a larger opportunity set. An example of this would be its eScan technology, acquired in late 2013. This solution helps hospitals and healthcare providers reduce uncompensated care costs by identifying patient coverage after services were provided. This acquisition augmented its existing products that included an upfront eligibility and ability to pay estimation service. But it moves the company into a larger market opportunity by identifying insurance and ability to pay during the stay.In addition to further penetrating existing verticals, we think there is a large opportunity to advance into other verticals that are underserved by the credit reporting agencies. There are many ancillary markets that are very close and adjacent to existing verticals, especially within the financial services industry. These include rental application and verification services, a recent product launch for the business. We believe that it will continue to identify key areas of need and capitalize on these deficiencies through product innovation or acquisition-based expansion.Lastly, TRU's international growth story is impressive. Instead of growing widespread, it typically picks and chooses its end-markets in order to expand into the higher-growing and better-positioned (emerging middle classes) markets. Most market entries are typically accomplished by establishing joint ventures or partnerships with local players. Its Indian story is the most compelling established through the partnership with CIBIL where it co-founded the first Indian bureau in 2001. Ownership in the business has risen to 66% from approximately 12% in 2001. These emerging economies are driving the need for credit bureau data with a fast-expanding middle class, increased fraud, new regulations, and a larger percentage of banking services available to larger population. (Source: Investor Presentation)ValuationWhen the company went public, it was highly indebted with nearly $3 billion of liabilities including senior notes, capital leases, and revolver issuance. The proceeds of the IPO, approximately $765 million, were used to reduce that debt outstanding to $2.25 billion. Management reduced its expensive senior PIK notes and refinanced other notes at lower interest costs. The reduction lowered its leverage to 4.6x, still an elevated level in the current macro environment.The shares are not a deep value by any means given the 18x forward earnings and 14x ttm EV/EBITDA. But we believe the business model is highly defensible with significant long-term capital appreciation potential as it expands internationally and launches new products and services domestically. Our model consists of a medium-term revenue growth forecast of 7-8%, which we derive from 4% core business growth, 2.5% new product and innovation growth, plus 2% emerging markets growth, partially offset by some foreign exchange.On an adjusted EBITDA basis, we think TRU can grow at low-double digits as the cost savings from recent efficiency and Project Spark initiatives can be used to expand margins. In addition, we see free cash flow increasing due to the cessation of significant technology investment and no further recurring corporate expenses reducing capex requirements that have been elevated the last three years.Our base case calls for EBITDA to grow to nearly $700 million by 2018, from $527 million in 2015. On free cash flow, we expect growth to $250-260 million by 2017 from $177 million last year. This added free cash flow should allow for additional growth investments but mainly to continue to delever the balance sheet. Net debt reduction is a primary driver of our valuation. We expect leverage to fall to under 4.0x by the end of the current year and possibly lower than 3.0x by the end of 2017.We have a $33 price target for year-end based on an 11.5x multiple, down from the current 14.3x ttm EV/EBITDA rate. The multiple has been on the wane lately so we wanted to bake in some further contraction as the near-term opportunities pass and growth eventually slows. We contrasted the model with a $650 million EBITDA target to account for the macro slowdowns and a 9.5x multiple which returned a $24 price target, for downside of just 5%.ConclusionShares of TransUnion responded favorably to the company's fiscal fourth-quarter results, but we think the long-term opportunity in the business is very positive. That should continue to benefit from an overall secular growth trend towards more financing and real-time credit monitoring/analysis. The market is still taking a cautious approach to those businesses with excessive leverage on the balance sheet. Should the macro picture slow materially and we enter a recession, the shares are likely to impacted. However, as of now, it appears we are in an uptrend in its end markets with consumer financing growing at a moderate pace. We believe as TRU de-levers its balance sheet quickly over the course of the next year to 18 months, the shares will de-risk and move higher."
3358175,87196,2015-07-26T16:46:07-04:00,TransUnion is part of an oligopoly of credit reporting agencies.Big Data is the new paradigm.There are lots of opportunities in emerging markets.The company has a competitive advantage with an economic moat.The stock is still trading near its IPO price.,"TransUnion (NYSE:TRU) is a buy, and here's why.Big Data is the new paradigm, and it's only getting bigger. On top of that, more countries are going to need what TransUnion offers. Emerging markets, anyone?TransUnion is one of the three largest credit reporting agencies in the U.S. Experian (OTCQX:EXPGY) and Equifax (NYSE:EFX) are the other two, effectively making this industry an oligopoly. You've probably used one, or all three, to look at your credit score and credit reports. But TransUnion makes its money selling your data to companies that want consumer reports, risk scores and other information to determine what kind of credit risk you are.The Chicago-based company launched its initial public offering June 25, making it the last credit agency to go public. It sold approximately 29.5 million shares for $22.50 a share, raising $664.8 million - making it one of the biggest IPOs of the year.On their first day of trading, the shares jumped 13% to $25.40. A month later, they've inched down to $24.89. Unlike Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), whose IPO was also in June, TransUnion's stock hasn't doubled in price. But I predict Fitbit is a flash in the pan, and that TransUnion's slow-and-steady approach will win this race.The key to big profits at TransUnion is its prevalence in financial Big Data. This is an asset that is hard to reproduce. And the company has a lot of consumer data - more than 30 petabytes of about more than one billion customers.""To put that staggering figure in context, it is roughly 2% of the total amount of information carried on the Internet on a daily basis, according to an estimate cited by the National Security Agency in 2013,"" reported Motley Fool.Data is where it's at. It takes a lot of time and money to build a huge proprietary database, making it hard to recreate. Companies are willing to pay a lot of money to access good data, and many great business models have been built on this idea.Currently, the company says it provides credit information and information management services to approximately 45,000 businesses and 500 million consumers worldwide. And more want to use it every day. Landlords need to see a credit report before they rent an apartment, and cell phone network providers expect it before they let you open an account.This treasure trove of data gives TransUnion what Warren Buffett calls an economic moat. Like a castle's moat, an economic moat presents new competitors with a huge barrier to entry into the industry. The moat - in this case, the high cost of acquiring all this data - makes it near impossible for another firm to build the contacts and data that the Big Three already have. This increases TransUnion's ability to maintain a competitive advantage and protect its long-term profits and market share.The big problem with TransUnion is that it keeps posting losses. For the fourth quarter of 2014, the company reported revenues of $303.4 million, but a $13.5 million loss. For the March quarter, revenues were $353.1 million, but it still lost $4.4 million.On an annual basis, 2014 revenues grew 10% to $1.3 billion. That gives the company a price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 3.07, which is low compared to that of its competitors. The price-to-sales for Equifax is 5.01, while that of Experian is at 3.65. The ratio means the company is undervalued in relation to the revenue it generates. For all of 2014, it posted a loss of $12.5 million. However, it has a very high gross margin of 62%.The pattern of loses was partly due to the rise in administrative expenses, such as maintaining a staff to combat data breaches and the cost of following the many forms of compliance law in the many different countries TransUnion does business in. The company has said it has a cost management strategy that includes ""strategic sourcing, labor management, streamlining back-office functions and improving overall processes.""I believe that in the long run, growth in revenue is likely to outpace the increase in costs, and the company will eventually turn profitable.Goldman Sachs says TransUnion will use money from the IPO to reduce its total debt-to-EBITDA from a multiple of 7.5 to between 5 and 6. This will reduce the debt by approximately $620 million. The company anticipates about $86 million in interest cost savings.The reduction in interest expense, coupled with TransUnion's organic revenue growth in international markets and declining spending on business optimization and technology infrastructure initiatives should increase the company's free cash flow.My advice is to buy TransUnion and hold it for the rest of 2015.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Morgan Securities, Credit Suisse, Wells Fargo, and others; positive news from them could boost TRU's stock price.Current research shows that a stock may produce above-market returns of close to 3% in anticipation of the conclusion of the quiet period.Given TRU's solid early market performance and promising fundamentals, we suggest investors buy TRU early to take full advantage of both the event and the opportunity for further upside.","The 40-day IPO quiet period for TransUnion (NYSE: TRU) expires on August 4th, 2015. The company held its IPO on June 25, 2015, with a midpoint price range of $22.50 per share.Consumers recognize TransUnion as one of the three major credit reporting agencies in the United States. The company also provides information and risk solutions to consumers and businesses.The company's stock price rose 13 percent on its first day of trading, and the price remains steady at $25 to $26 per share. The company raised $665 million from the IPO.Long-term investors can expect a bump in TransUnion's stock price within a few days of the quiet period expiration. We suggest buying in early to take full advantage of this likely increase.Company Overview: Major US Credit Reporting AgencyTransUnion is well-known as one of the three major credit reporting agencies in the United States. Experian (EXPN) and Equifax (NYSE:EFX) make up the other two agencies. TransUnion also delivers decision-making solutions to businesses throughout the world. Companies embed the solutions into their workflow, which helps them obtain new customers along with the ability to identify whether customers have the ability to pay for services rendered. The solutions TransUnion offers include customer portfolio risk assessment software, debt-collection solutions and software that helps prevent potential fraud.We previewed the IPO here, as well as the IPO quiet period expiration, for our premium subscribers. You can sign up for this service at the bottom of the article.Market Forecast: Large and Growing DemandCurrently, TransUnion provides 90,000 data sources with an average annual growth rate of 25 percent. The sources are used to obtain financial information for over one billion consumers worldwide. Consumers include financial institutions, public repositories, private companies and their databases along with private sector customers.The healthcare, insurance and financial services industries continue to rely on TransUnion for access to fast and accurate credit information. With new banking regulations, small-to-medium sized businesses and consumers now use alternative lending platforms such as peer-to-peer and balance sheet lenders for their financing. TransUnion supports those lending platforms with comprehensive credit information along with risk assessment tools that analyze customer's employment and credit information.Overview of Company Financials: Increasing Revenues, Decreasing LossesTransUnion reported earnings for the quarter ending March 31, 2014, of $353 million. According to the company, that was an increase of 16 percent compared to the same quarter last year. The company also reported an increase of 20 percent in its earnings before income taxes depreciation amortization, which came in at an adjusted $114 million. The margin on the company's EBITDA was 32.3 percent, which was a 90 basis points increase compared to the same time last year, according to TransUnion.However, the company reported a net loss of $4.4 million for the first-quarter of this year. The company did decrease its losses from the first-quarter of last year when the company reported a net loss of $13.5 million. Investors considering taking a long position in TransUnion should recognize the company has not reported a net profit in the past four quarters; however, the company has increased revenues since Dec. 31, 2012.Risk Factors Mitigated By Very Few CompetitorsThe company reports a substantial amount of debt, which could hurt its overall stock performance now and in the future. According to the company, the debt's book value totaled $3 billion, as of March 31, 2015. Analysts do point out the company has reduced losses with respect to net income and revenues continue to increase year-over-year.TransUnion faces little to no competition in the credit reporting industry. The other major credit reporting bureaus, Experian and Equifax, essentially work in tandem with TransUnion, making it difficult for any new entrants in the market to compete with any of the companies. TransUnion points out that it owns several proprietary datasets, holding vital consumer credit information, along with driver violation histories and healthcare records, which any new competition would find impossible to emulate.Conclusion: Buy TRU Ahead of Quiet Period ExpirationCurrent research shows that a stock may produce above-market returns of close to 3% in anticipation of the conclusion of the quiet period. Given this likely boost on the horizon for TRU (supported by a powerful underwriting team), we suggest investors buy in ahead of the event to take full advantage of potential gains.TRU's heavy hitting syndicate, including Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC), Deutsche Bank Securities (NYSE:DB), Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), J.P. Morgan Securities (NYSE:JPM), Credit Suisse Securities (NYSE:CS), Drexel Hamilton, Evercore Group, Loop Capital Markets, RBC Capital Markets, Stifel Nicolaus, and Wells Fargo Securities (NYSE:WFC) will likely seek to capitalize on the stock's recent growth through the release of positive reports on August 5th.The impending event, along with TRU's solid early market performance and promising fundamentals, is another reason to buy into the growing firm."

3983141,20905,2016-06-20T13:39:35-04:00,,"Today, Monday June 20, 2016, IDI, Inc. (IDI) an emerging company in the data fusion and digital marketing industry and TransUnion (TRU), the credit agency and consumer data behemoth have entered in court mandated settlement discussions. Judge Paul G Hyman, Jr., Chief United States Bankruptcy Judge signed this order in his court on May 26, 2016. His signed order can be seen here:Docket #436TRU Legal Filing May 27 2016 - Judicial Settlement ConferenceThis judicial settlement conference is scheduled to begin at 9:30am and is scheduled to terminate at 11pm EST. Representatives of both IDI Inc. and TransUnion will be on site to confer with their respective counsel and to utilize their best efforts to settle this litigation.To review, TransUnion's subsidiary - TransUnion Risk and Alternative Data Solutions (TRADS) is the plaintiff against The Best One (TBO) and Ole Poulsen, who is the Chief Science Officer & Systems Architect of IDI Inc. These legal proceedings began back in October 2014 after TransUnion purchased the assets of TLO LLC (The Last One - formed by the late father of Data Fusion, Hank Asher and his business partner Ole Poulsen) out of bankruptcy. Florida Southern Bankruptcy Court Case #14 - 01793 (source).For those who are unfamiliar with Mr. Asher - here is a noteworthy piece on him in a Vanity Fair article from December 2004.And here is a definitive timeline of events leading up to this litigation:+ 1992 - Mr. Asher formed DBT Technologies with a proprietary product called AutoTrack (for Florida's DMV).+ 1999 - Asher gets pushed out of DBT Technologies (allegedly by billionaire Ken Langone) due to Asher's past; FBI/DEA suspends contracts. He collects $140 million upon his departure.+ 1999 - Asher forms Seisint with Michael Brauser (current Chairman of IDI, Inc.) with product called Accurint to compete against his former company DBT Technologies. Derek Dubner (current CEO of IDI, Inc.) joins Seisint in 1999 as Corporate Counsel (Dubner also served as Asher's personal lawyer). Ole Poulsen (current Chief Science Officer & Systems Architect of IDI, Inc.) also joins Seisint in 1999 and becomes lead programmer.+ DBT sold to Choicepoint in 2000 - Ken Langone joins Board of Choicepoint+ While at Seisint, Asher develops MATRIX (Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange) - a majority of the 9/11 hijackers show up on Asher's MATRIX+ MATRIX is used to identify (vehicle ID) the Beltway Snipers - John Allen Muhammad+ July 2004 - Asher sells Seisint to LexisNexis Group (UK's Reed Elsevier) for $775 million - (source)+ 2009 - Hank Asher (with Ole Poulsen as co-founder) form TLO (""The Last One"") and states ""TLOxp has 100x the power that I had with my last previous invention."" - (source). TLO had over 17,500 subscribers and generated approximately $30 million in revenue when Asher dies. Current CEO of IDI Inc. Derek Dubner, current President of IDI Inc. James Reilly and IDI Inc. Chief Financial Officer Dan MacLachlan held executive management roles at Asher's TLO (Dubner was General Counsel of TLO, Reilly was Senior VP of Sales & business Development at TLO and MacLachlan was CFO).+ January 2013 - Hank Asher dies unexpectedly - (source)+ March - April 2013 - Ole Poulsen departs TLO officially (with NO non-compete clause).+ May 2013 - TLO - now run by Asher's daughter's (Desiree Asher and Carley Asher Yoost) place the company into bankruptcy in order to auction TLO's assets. - (source) TLO bankruptcy counsel was Furr & Cohen based out of Boca Raton, FL.+ November 2013 - Florida bankruptcy court announces TransUnion (NYSE:TRU) wins the bidding for TLO LLC and pays $152.4 million in cash - (source) 9. TransUnion (NYSE:TRU) acquisition details of TLO LLC on page 87 of TRU's 2013 Annual Report - (source)This deal closes in December 2013.Please note: Current Chairman of IDI Inc. Michael Brauser and Vice Chairman of IDI, billionaire Dr. Philip Frost did team up with Jules Kroll and Tom Glocer (former CEO of Reuters) to bid on TLO in bankruptcy for $104 million in a vehicle named Data Acquisition Group (DAG) - but were unsuccessful.Michael Brauser and billionaire Dr. Philip Frost form The Best One (TBO) in September 2014 and TBO purchases Interactive Data (based in Atlanta, GA) in October 2014. Publicly traded Tiger Media (NYSEMkt: IDI) merges with TBO in December 2014 (entry into data fusion and exit of Tiger Media's legacy business).After taking ownership of TLO LLC in bankruptcy, TransUnion (TRU) undertook a restructuring of TLO's business and approximately ten (10) months after buying these assets, TransUnion realized that they did not own the intellectual property and source code of the TLOxp product. They were (and still are) unable to update/improve/change the TLOxp product as the original source code was owned by Ole Poulsen (who now is the Chief Science Officer & Systems Architect of IDI, Inc.). When Ole Poulsen joined IDI Inc. in early September/October 2014 as Chief Science Officer, he also sold his intellectual property of the TLOxp product (BOLT/bParser code) to IDI Inc. TLOxp is estimated to generate approximately $100 million in sales (for TransUnion) currently.IDI Inc. had for over one (1) year requested internal TransUnion documents specifically pertaining to its purchase of TLO's assets. After a year of waiting, TransUnion delivered these internal documents to counsel of IDI on Friday, March 4, 2016 at 5:25pm (after business hours). In this discovery document (attached above - Document 295 in Case 14 - 01793-PGH) are two (2) alarming discoveries:+ TransUnion's own internal documents establishing its knowledge at the time of the TLO LLC bankruptcy sale auction, that TLO did not own assets that TransUnion wanted. (Specifically the BParser code owned by Ole Poulsen). - So TLOxp product cannot be updated, changed or even improved!TRU Legal Filing Mar 7 2016 Doc 295+ Second, TLO (then led by Asher's daughter's Desiree and Carly) had its bankruptcy counsel modify a carte blanche finding in the proposed sale order in order to get these assets; this carte blanche finding was submitted to Judge Paul G. Hyman's Court, after he instructed counsel for TransUnion (and TLO - the debtor) not to include such a modification. [Insert TRU legal Doc 300 here]TRU Legal Filing Mar 7 2016 Doc 300Also interesting in this discovery document is the following (in TRU legal Doc 295):""During oral depositions on TransUnion's belated production, it was also learned that subsequent to the sale, Desiree Asher and Carly Yoost, who were controlling the debtor, received substantial benefits from TransUnion, via sham transactions, resulting in their receiving more value pro rata than other direct or indirect equity holders."" Quite an alarming statement above - but now is clearly apparent that the Asher daughters wanted the $$$ from the sale as quickly as possible, in addition to wanting more money for themselves.Given the above discovery in internal memos from TransUnion, I believe a compelling legal argument can be made as to the fact that Transunion has been selling a product that they do not own the intellectual property to - TLOxp - without a license; now in its 3rd fiscal year. And maybe I am oversimplifying this: if I am a company and I purchase your company in bankruptcy court/auction - items such as office lease, office furniture, customers, files, software on existing computers, bank assets, etc. does that give me the right to saying that I own the intellectual property of the Intel chip inside those desktop computers? I think the late Andy Grove would have a different opinion about that!!Let's take a quick look at TransUnion (NYSE:TRU). TransUnion is a leading global risk and information solutions provider to businesses and consumers. The Company provides consumer reports, risk scores, analytical services and decision capabilities to businesses. TransUnion (NYSE:TRU) was taken private by Advent International and Goldman Sachs Private Equity in April 2012 for $1.592 billion - (first announced Feb 2012).+ TransUnion (NYSE:TRU) goes public again June 30, 2015 at $22.50 per share+ TransUnion currently has a market capitalization of $ 5.9 billion (and has $2.5 billion in debt - Q1 end 2016).What has now come to the forefront of this discussion is the conduct of TransUnion and one of its largest shareholders. On the day of this discovery document was available (Doc 295) for the public (via PACER), Monday, March 7, 2016 - TransUnion files for a secondary offering of 15,652,500 (plus an option for an additional 2,225,498 shares) from ""selling stockholders"" - Advent International Corp. (one of the original buyout firms). This secondary was completed on Wednesday, March 9, 2016 raising $450 million for Advent International. And no more than ten (10) days later after Judge Paul Hyman signs an order mandating settlement talks between IDI Inc. and TransUnion, TransUnion announces and completes ANOTHER secondary offering of over 15,000,000 shares (source). This offering wound up being 18,000,000 shares priced at $32.10 and raised over $577 million. So over the past four (4) months, controlling shareholder Advent International has sold just under $1 billion in shares of TransUnion. Could Goldman Sachs Private Equity be far behind in selling some of their stake and lowering their exposure?What may be most alarming to investors of TransUnion (NYSE:TRU) as the lead plaintiff in its litigation against TBO (IDI, Inc.) is the fact that TransUnion has neglected to mention these proceedings in its SEC filed audited Annual Reports. There is no mention of the case or under their ""Risk Factors"" section in Transunion's 2012, 2013, 2014, or 2015 Annual Reports (Pages 23 to 43).It is important to note that TransUnion paid $154 million for TLO LLC in December 2013 - which is equivalent to approximately 10% of TransUnion's sales (for 2015) and also 10% of TransUnion's current equity value. How is that not a material event? IDI Inc. specifically mentions this litigation in its 2015 Annual Report under Legal Proceedings - Page 22.At this point it is undetermined that a settlement will be reached by both parties; if no agreement is reached by 11pm on Monday, June 20 2016, then the bench trial is expected to continue over the next several weeks. And as an investor, it is important to understand any potential outcome. Let's say in this exercise that TransUnion wins this case; and Mr. Poulsen and IDI Inc. are ordered to hand over the ""BParser code"" - it is imperative to keep in mind that the TLOxp technology is over five (5) years old currently, and to many in the industry, is outdated. As far as IDI, Inc.'s own products, a negative ruling against IDI Inc. would be a non-event because IDI Inc.'s new, proprietary offering that competes against TLOxp - called idiCORE - is based on completely new programming language (written by Ole Poulsen).idiCORE was recently released in late April (May 2nd news announcement) idiCORE™, a product to serve the risk management industry that provides instant, comprehensive views of individuals, businesses, assets and their interrelationships. idiCORE is an advanced analytical solution to be used across multiple industries, including law enforcement, government, financial services, insurance, and corporate risk.; CEO Derek Dubner recently commented:""We have already commercially launched idiCORE, methodically targeting various industry segments with plans to quickly transition to a full rollout. This is no small feat as we had to build a cloud-based data fusion platform, proprietary algorithms, acquire and assimilate massive data sets, and load test to ensure stability for thousands of users. Legacy systems took upwards of 3-4 years to accomplish this. From the time that we finally completed staffing our Seattle office, we have accomplished this in less than 14 months."" (source)On June 6, 2016, IDI, Inc. provided a business update specific to idiCORE (source).In just 32 days since the commercial release of idiCORE (May 2, 2016), IDI has on-boarded over 2,800 users. These users represent a variety of industries within the risk management space, including law firms, debt recovery companies, investigative companies, process servers, and more. Derek Dubner, CEO of IDI stated, ""While confident that we would see positive market reaction upon the release of our new technology, the current rate of adoption has exceeded our own expectations for the initial commercial offering of idiCORE. This is especially exciting given that this is only an early phase of the evolution of this product. We know historically that strong market adoption is the precursor to integration into end-user workflow, which then translates to strong revenue.""So how does IDI's new revolutionary product - idiCORE compare to its direct competitors? Specifically, TLOxp and Lexis Nexis' Accurint product? After putting these products in a side-by-side comparison, here is what I discovered:TLOxp - a preferred product over Accurint (mostly due to better friendly interface). A newer product that has an age of no more than 7 years - but now becoming dated.Accurint - contains more comprehensive historical address information (pre-2000). Priced on par with TLOxp. Users sometime subscribe to both TLOxp and Accurint to check/verify the information from each system.Westlaw - not a very comprehensive search product; information is ""stale"" and incomplete. Lawyers are compelled to search other databases for more detailed information; very expensive and the highest price per search. But still the premier product in case law search.idiCORE - almost 2 months in commercial release; customers love the fast results (due to proprietary IDI programming and cloud infrastructure. Better user interface (than TLOxp) and very easy to navigate. Customers are impressed with the accuracy of data as well as the breadth of information available. Going to be a huge player in this space and will win business away from Accurint and TLOxp.IDI Inc. (NYSEMkt:IDI) is a young, emerging, fast growing Company in the data fusion space and with its recent launch of revolutionary idiCORE product combined with its strength of digital marketing subsidiary Fluent LLC the Company will soon be acknowledged as a leader in its field. IDI Inc. is already beginning to receive this recognition as it has been selected for inclusion in the Russell 3000 Index and Russell Global Index which will be reconstituted on June 24, 2016. As an investor can clearly see the late Hank Asher's legacy is indeed intact; most of his trusted employees and partners have elected to transition over to fast growing IDI Inc. simply because they have the best and far superior product in the industry.For investors familiar with such an industry and trying to put this idea of data fusion into today's modern context, the company Choicepoint (formerly on the NYSE:CPS) is the best example that I can think of that best exemplifies a data fusion & mining business. Choicepoint was spun off from Equifax Inc. in 1997 and was primarily a data aggregation company that acted as a private intelligence service to government and industry. After several years of rapid organic growth combined with strategic acquisitions, Choicepoint was bought by Reed Elsevier in February 2008 for $3.6 Billion. I believe IDI Inc. will have a short life as a public company - its exceptional management and superior cloud based products will make it a leader in the digital consumer marketing and data fusion space. If I had any ""fear"" about IDI Inc. and its future it would be the danger of them being bought out during this short time period (next 4 - 5 years) by the likes of Google Analytics, Facebook, IBM's Watson Division, Oracle, or Reed Elsevier.DISCLAIMER:Peter A Delgado II is the Managing Director of Threshold Capital Corp, a state Registered Investment Adviser in the State of New Jersey.

The company has established itself as a leader in credit score reporting and provides risk assessment solutions to a variety of clients. The market opportunity comes from their unique position to build big data solutions and analytics from a wealth of information and databases they have been building for a long time. Rapidly expanding international demand also represents a sizable market opportunity and strong future growth potential. The current midpoint fully diluted market cap will be around $4 billion, which should entice early investors and could result in a sky-rocketing price.MarketTransunion is a well-established player in the consumer credit and risk assessment industry. The company hopes to leverage this leadership position to capitalize on the ever-expanding market for analytic services across a variety of industries. Since 2009, the analytics market has outstripped many industries with an average growth rate of 12%. This growth is expected to increase to 15% annually over the next five years. Effectively capturing this market will require a variety of services and the right data to drive good, sound decision making. Transunion currently boasts exposure petabytes of extremely valuable data. Source: Transunion S-1The fastest growing domestic segment for Transunion has been their decision services and advanced analytics. The segment grew by over 22% in sales in the first quarter of 2015, compared to Q1 2014. The company's core online data services grew by 14% in the same period. Strong revenue growth was also propelled by emerging markets. Consumer end-services also showed substantial growth. Data breaches and recent emphasis on credit scores could be fueling consumer interest and segment growth. The U.S. still represents about 80% of total revenue.Source: Transunion S-1FinancesIn 2014, Transunion posted $1.3 billion in sales revenue, and based on Q1 growth is on track to hit $1.5 billion in 2015. The company, however, did see a slipping in operating income from 2013 to 2014. Administrative expenses was one of the fastest growing expense items. For full year 2014, the company posted a $12.5 million loss, which was smaller than the net loss in 2013. Strong growth should eventually outpace expense growth, and lead to profitability for Transunion in the future.Source: Transunion S-1SupportTransunion's largest current owner is a Goldman Sachs investment fund. The company was restructured in early 2012. Since then, the organization has underwent a variety of acquisitions fueled by debt and equity backers. The IPO will represent a strong return on investment for the Goldman fund and a cash out opportunity. Goldman has positioned Transunion for a strong IPO, investors should be cognizant of the timing and potential price drop as Goldman exits the company.Source: Transunion S-1ValuationBased on the current midpoint price of $22 per share, Transunion's fully diluted market cap will be at $4 billion. The market cap would represent a 3.1x price-to-sales multiple. Based on comparable peers, this multiple is well below the peer group. Transunion is also considerably smaller in terms of market cap than their peers. The smaller size could also translate to greater growth potential and more flexibility. These factors traditionally lead to even larger price-to-sales multiples. Based on the peer group average price-to-sales multiple of 5.3x, Transunion would be valued at $6.9 billion or about $38 per share. The implied price would be over 70% higher than the IPO midpoint.Source: Google FinanceSummaryTransunion is entering into an IPO market that is in high demand of name brands. Recent IPOs from Fitbit (NYSE:FIT), PartyCity (NYSE:PRTY), GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY), and others were all well received with IPO pops and price increases after trading commenced. The appetite for quality, recognizable companies is strong. Transunion, its strong backing, and desirable valuation will be no exception. Investors should expect a strong opening return and short-term upside price potential."

3268105,70035,2015-06-18T13:17:23-04:00,"The credit reporting bureau is due to float 29.5 million shares on NYSE.TransUnion's IPO is poised to be largest of 2015.The company is seeking to capitalize on recent market expansion, yet underlying debt issues could still scare away investors.","TransUnion, the Chicago-based consumer reporting agency, announced on Monday an expected price range of $21 to $23 per share for the company's forthcoming stock market floatation.America's third largest credit bureau is seeking to raise about $782 million from its initial public offering, but doubts linger over the firm's ability to maintain value in the foreseeable and long-term future.While the company has grown a large client base in recent years, and developed some of the most innovative and market-leading big data platforms around, there are concerns about its rising debt load and growing competition from other businesses in the sector.The company's client base is impressive; it delivers services in 33 countries, and claims to have accounts with around 500 million customers and 45000 businesses. Not only does it supply credit data to individuals seeking to manage their credit and risk scores, but it also provides extensive analytical and informational management services on a business-to-business basis.Its importance in the industry is reflected in the fact that its IPO is likely to be one of the largest on the stock exchange in 2015.TransUnion's product resume is no less impressive. It caters to customers seeking to recover uncompensated health care bills with its Insurance Coverage Discovery tool, and it offers a digital marketing service linking 135 million US users with the AdSurety platform. That can be used to power websites such as Swap.com. It even services the public sector with its TLOxp protocol, which enables government and law enforcement agencies to prevent fraud and devise sophisticated threat assessment procedures.Yet, despite its admirable client and product portfolios, and further oversees expansion into the Indian, Asian, and African markets, TransUnion's growth has been moderate. The adjusted EBITDA figures meant that last year's revenues came to $454.3 million, up 11.2% from 2013's $408.5 million.There are still more worrying issues in the shape of the business's rising debt level. The company IPO prospectus gave some indication of the seriousness of its predicament, when it wrote, ""We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.""Not the sort of words a potential investor wants to hear.In addition to mounting debt problems, the company is facing stiffer competition in the credit scoring field from firms offering the same services, but for free. One such platform is provided for by Credit Karma, which seeks to generate revenue from targeted advertisements geared towards financial products.TransUnion are well aware of this development in the sector, and again nod towards possible future difficulties in their floatation prospectus, which says: ""We consistently face downward pressure on the pricing of our products, which could result in reduced prices for certain products, or a loss of market share.""This upcoming IPO isn't the first time TransUnion have considered going public. In 2011 it flirted with the idea of floating on the stock exchange, but decided in the end to sell to Advent International and Goldman Sachs.The markets at that point were flooded with capital due to the Federal Reserve's quantitative easing measures, and the need to raise funds through an IPO just wasn't there.Still, despite all the concerns regarding TransUnion's future, there probably isn't a better time to issue an IPO. The company hasn't listed a date for the floatation, but the market is currently in rude health, and it shouldn't be far off. But investors will be looking for value with this stock, so don't be surprised if customers decide to question the credit bureau's own creditworthiness."

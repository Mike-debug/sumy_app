2522855,66493,2014-09-27T08:45:00-04:00,"Total System Services' growth has accelerated in recent years. Revenue growth has risen into the double digits and should remain there for the next several years.The company's recent acquisition NetSpend is boosting revenue growth. The prepaid card market is expected to growth rapidly and NetSpend should be able to take advantage of this growth.NetSpend could be facing increased regulation but the current regulatory push appears to only be for more disclosure. Additionally despite increased competition, NetSpend has the advantage of scale.In order for NetSpend to continue to drive growth, the company's North America revenue needs to offset the other segments' lack luster growth. This has happen so far in 2014.North America should continue to offset the decline in merchant revenue and any slowdown in international revenue. North America and NetSpend will help Total System Services outperform.","Total System Services, Inc. (NYSE:TSS) is a provider of payment processing services, merchant services, and prepaid cards. Over the last few years, the company's financial performance has gradually improved. From 2009-2013, revenue grew at a CAGR of 6.2%. Yet, revenue growth has accelerated in the last year and half. In 2013, revenue grew 14.0% and 36.1% in the first half of 2014. The company's faster growth rate is being driven by strong financial performance in the United States and their NetSpend operating segment. The company's revenue growth has accelerated but operating margin has declined. In 2013, operating margin was 18.1% which is slightly lower than 2009's 20.5%. Although, operating margin has declined to 15.0% in the first half of 2014. The company's operating margin in 2014 has been impacted by the integration of NetSpend. The integration is temporarily impacting operating margin. However, can Total System Services continue to grow double-digits?Total System Services is experiencing growth issues with two operating segments. The International segment has benefited from foreign currency gains which has hidden slow operating growth. Additionally, the merchant business has been declining and is expected to continue to decline in 2014. So far in 2014, these two operating segments accounted for 35.0% of total revenue. Yet, the company's other two operating segments are performing well. In first half of 2014, the company's largest operating segment the U.S. (42.7% of total revenue) has grown in the high-single digits. U.S. revenue is benefiting from strong customer and transaction growth. The company has also benefited from recent cyber security breaches which has resulted in higher card production revenue. Additionally, the U.S. business is expected to continue to grow well. The U.S. segment's growth should offset any declines in the other struggling operating segments. This increases the importance of NetSpend on revenue growth. NetSpend is well positioned to continue to drive revenue growth.Mixed ResultsManagement has been able to accelerate the company's growth rate over the last few years. Yet, two operating segments are struggling to grow. So far in 2014, the international segment has accounted for 15.0% of total revenue. The International segment has grown 11.0% in Q2 and 6.4% for the first half. However, this growth has been driven by currency gains. In the Q2 2014 10-Q, management writes about international growth ""The 11.0% and 6.4% increases...are driven by increases of $7.2 million and $11.4 million associated with currency translation, offset by decreases associated with client deconversions."" The international segment was positively impacted by currency translation in 2014 but was negatively impacted in 2013. The recent currency gains have hidden the international segments struggles. For example excluding currency gains, the segment's growth was only 1.8% in Q2. Yet despite the recent struggles, international revenue isn't expected to decline and should start to improve due to upcoming deals and continue competitiveness. On the Q2 conference call, Troy Woods COO talked about several upcoming deals ""We are currently working on three conversions and three program launches that will deliver approximately 3 million new consumer and commercial accounts over the next 24-months. We continued to win in the marketplace and retain clients against tough competition as evidenced by a newly signed managed services agreement to support a new client in the UK.""The international segment has performed well mainly due to currency gains. However, the segment is still growing (1.8% in Q2) and isn't needed to drive growth. The international segment only needs to maintain growth. Fortunately, management did notice an uptick in new projects. On the Q2 conference call, Troy Woods talked about a recent trend ""...we did note an uptick in new project revenue in June and we believe this trend will continue for the remainder of the year."" The international segment has struggled but shouldn't weigh heavily on revenue growth. However, the merchant segment has and is expected to continue to decline in 2014. The segment's revenue declined 4.2% in the first half. The recent decline has been greater than expected. On the Q2 conference call, Troy Woods talked about legacy growth ""...our growth from our legacy TSYS Merchant Solutions Group was less than expected for the quarter."" Fortunately, the segment is only expected to decline single-digits for the entire year. Although, the segment represents nearly 20% of revenue and will impact growth. However, the U.S. operating segment's strong growth and size should more than compensate for this decline.The North America segment's revenue (42.7% of total revenue) grew 8.7% in Q2 and 8.9% in the first half. The segment experienced strong transaction and customer growth in the first half. The number of transactions increased 20.7% while accounts on file increased 18.5%. The segment's performance has been strong and has benefited from recent security breaches. On the Q1 conference call, Troy Woods talked about data breaches helping revenue growth ""Also during the quarter, we saw improved sales in broad services and in card production services. And almost half of our increase in card production services was the result of the re-issuances of cards due to several retailer breaches."" The company's output segment (card production) grew 16.4% y/y in Q1. The 16.4% growth resulted in a 2.0% increase in segment revenue. Cyber security breaches haven't shown any signs of slowing down which should help continue to boost card production revenue. Despite already having a significant North American presents, management believes there is still plenty of room to grow. On the Q2 conference call, Paul Todd CFO talked about growth potential in the U.S. market ""There is still 60% of the business just in the segment that you're talking about Jamie that we don't have. You know that's in-house, processed at another third-party provider..."" Management also believes this segment will continue its strong growth in the second half. On the Q2 conference call, Troy Woods gave guidance ""We are also guiding our revenue growth for the North America segment to be in the 8% to 10% range for the year and adjusted operating margin for the year to be in the 34% to 36% range."" North America's percentage of revenue and growth will offset merchant's decline and international's slow growth. Although in order to maintain double-digit growth, NetSpend will have to continue its rapid growth. NetSpend's rapid growth should continue despite increasing competition and regulatory risk.Rapidly Growing Market With Regulatory RiskThe prepaid card market is expected to grow rapidly. In 2009, the U.S. prepaid market was an estimated $28.6 billion and is expected to reach $168 billion by 2015, according to Mercator Advisory Group. The U.S. market is large but the global market is much larger. Partners in Prepaid estimates the global prepaid market will reach $822 billion by 2017. The prepaid market is growing rapidly and NetSpend is helping Total System Services take advantage of this growth. In the first half of 2014, NetSpend accounted for the majority of the company's 30% revenue growth. This is due to NetSpend being integrated into the income statement. In the first half of 2014, NetSpend accounted for $249 million of the $282 million in revenue growth. Without NetSpend's revenue, total revenue would have grown 3.0%. As shown above, the company's slow growth is the result of two operating segments. This has increased the importance of NetSpend to revenue growth.NetSpend has inorganically boosted growth but is also growing well organically. On the Q1 conference call, Troy Woods talked about NetSpend's revenue growth ""...NetSpend produced record revenues for the quarter of $132.6 million, representing a 13.1% increase over the same period last year."" NetSpend's Q1 double-digit growth was followed by an 11.4% y/y increase in Q2. Despite double-digit growth, NetSpend's revenue has been impacted by a switch in the company's payment model. The company switched from a pay as you go model to a monthly model. The switch has impacted revenue growth in the first half but isn't expected to significantly impact growth in the second half. On the Q2 conference call, Troy Woods talked about NetSpend's growth ""... the third quarter and the fourth quarter you will see elevated growth metrics for NetSpend... NetSpend is absolutely a double-digit top line growth company for the foreseeable future."" In the first half of 2014, NetSpend represented 23.3% of total revenue. As a result, NetSpend should be able to drive revenue growth for many years. However, the segment does face some regulatory risk, which may impact growth.In Q2, NetSpend generated 73.3% of their revenue from cardholder fees. The other 26.7% was generated through interchange. The company charges a fee for transactions, balance inquiries, maintenance, overdraft, and other services. Since prepaid cards aren't heavily regulated, these fees don't have to be disclosed. Due to the rapid rise in usage, there has been a significant increase in complaints regarding these fees. The rise in complaints has garnered the attention of regulatory bodies. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or CFPB has started to take complaints regarding prepaid fees and is expected to propose a prepaid card rule. Fortunately, the current push by the CFPB is for more disclosure rather than limiting fees. Yet, regulation has impacted other card markets like debit cards. Limits were put on debit card swipe fees which impacted revenue from debit cards. Reuters reports ""They directed the Fed to set a limit that would cover the costs to banks to provide the cards, ignoring any expenses that were not tied to specific debit transactions."" Yet, Reuters reports the FED increased the scope of swipe fees ""The Fed decided network processing fees, costs to monitor transactions for fraud and other expenses were relevant, even though they were not specifically mentioned in the law, and it incorporated them into the 21-cent cap. Merchants argued those costs went beyond what was allowed under the law."" For now, the push to regulate prepaid cards is focused more on disclosure rather than fee limitations. Regulation risk has and will always be a part of this operating segment. NetSpend will have to adjust to any future regulations. Yet, the prepaid market is growing rapidly and NetSpend has an advantage over new market participants.Competition in the prepaid market is increasing. A Pew Research report found in 2012 nonbanks (NetSpend) dominated the market. In 2013, nonbanks still control the majority (71%) of the market. However in 2013, banks now manage three of the ten largest prepaid cards which is an increase from zero in 2012. The prepaid market also includes several large retailers such as Wal-Mart, Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Target, Inc. (NYSE:TGT), and telecommunication companies like T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), according to the Washington Post. Competition has increased but incumbents still have a major advantage. New entrants aren't able to profitably compete on price due to their small customer base. Due to their large customer base, incumbents have significant economies of scale. Additionally if new market participants charge higher than normal fees, they run the risk of regulatory issues. For example, the Washington Post reports JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) plans to stop issuing prepaid cards for corporations and the government due to fee inquires by New York state. Incumbents are able to generate sizable profits without having to charge higher than normal fees. They have large customer bases which produces economies of scale. Although competition has increased, incumbents like NetSpend still have an advantage over new competitors.The Company's Strong Financial Performance Will ContinueManagement has been able to accelerate revenue growth over the last few years. The acceleration is being driven by their recent acquisition and strong performance in their U.S. operating segment. The company's recent string of double-digit growth should continue due to these two operating segments strong performance. Additionally, the company's strong growth should continue despite the struggles of two operating segments. The international operating segment grew 11.0% in Q2 but this was mainly due to currency gains. Yet without the currency gains, the international segment did grow 1.8% and isn't expected to decline. The segment only needs to maintain positive growth. International revenue should continue to grow due to upcoming initiatives and deals. The international segment shouldn't weigh heavily on growth but the merchant segment is going to have more of an impact. In 2014, the merchant segment is expected to decline. Fortunately, the segment is only expected to decline single-digits. This decline should be more than offset by strong growth in the United States. The United States operating segment has experience strong customer and transaction growth. Additionally despite a strong market presents, the company still has plenty of room to grow. Management expects the segment to grow high-single digits. The company and segment are benefiting from the growth in noncash transactions and also security breaches. The recent security breaches have resulted in increased card production revenue. The U.S. segment should offset the other two struggling operating segments. Yet, NetSpend will also be needed to help drive revenue growth.NetSpend operates in the rapidly growing prepaid card market. NetSpend has benefited greatly from the market's growth. Despite a recent pricing change which impacted growth, NetSpend's revenue has grown double-digits. Additionally, management believes the operating segment should continue to grow double-digits for the foreseeable future. Although, there has been increasing sentiment to regulate the prepaid card market. Yet, the regulatory push appears to be focusing on disclose rather than fee limitations. The disclosure of fees won't significantly impact revenue from prepaid cards. Despite increasing competition, the incumbents (NetSpend) have an advantage over market participants. Due to their large customer base, NetSpend has significant economies of scale which helps keep fees low while still remaining profitable. Total System Services is benefiting greatly from the rise in non-cash transactions. They are growing well in the United States which should offset any struggles in other operating segments. NetSpend is and should continue to grow double-digits for the foreseeable future. These two operating segments will the company and their stock outperform."
2479065,71335,2014-09-08T14:46:14-04:00,The company has consistently grown Accounts on File and Transactions in North America and International Service segments.A successful restructuring through acquisitions in the Merchant Services segment will lead to mid to high single digit growth.The NetSpend segment's strong distribution network will enable it to continue account and revenue growth.,"Total System Services (abbreviated as TSYS) (Ticker:TSS) provides transaction processing and other payment-related services. TSYS generates revenue based on the number of accounts on file (AOF), transactions and authorizations processed, statements mailed, cards embossed and mailed, and other processing services for cardholder AOF.Operating SegmentsTSYS' services are provided through four operating segments: North America Services, International Services, Merchant Services, and NetSpend.Data for both charts compiled from 2013 Annual Report.TSYS' revenues in its North America Services and International Services segments are derived from electronic payment processing for clients. There are certain basic core services provided to all of TSYS' processing clients. The core services include housing an account on TSYS' system, authorizing transactions, accumulating monthly transactional activity and providing a monthly statement. From these core services, TSYS' clients also have the option to use fraud and portfolio management services. Collectively, these services are greatly affected by the volume of transactions and AOF.TSYS also offers value added products and services such as data analytics and application processing, which are not dependent on transaction volume of AOF. These ancillary products and services, along with offerings such as card production, managed services, customized reporting and custom programming provided to clients at an hourly rate, are non-volume based products and services.North America ServicesThe North America Services segment provides issuer account solutions for financial institutions and other organizations primarily based in North America. Below is a summary of the North America Services segment using data compiled from the 2013 Annual Report:As you can see from the table above, consecutive segment growth in transactions was driven by similar increases in Accounts on File. In 2012, AOF increased by 20.9% and transactions increased by 12.2%. In 2013, AOF increased by 13.4% and transactions increased by 12.7%. As a result, the North America Services segment has seen consistent revenue, margin and income growth. Revenues rose 1.1% in 2012 and 3.6% in 2013. Margin growth of roughly 400 basis points from 2011 to 2013 led to even higher income growth. Segment operating income rose 13.7% in 2012 and 8.7% in 2013.International ServicesThe International Services segment provides issuer account solutions for financial institutions and other organizations outside of North America. Below is a summary of the International Services segment using data compiled from the 2013 Annual Report:Total segment revenues decreased $3.9 million for 2013 vs. 2012 due to currency translations which reduced revenue by $20.3 million. If the currency effect is backed out, revenue actually grew 4% in 2013 vs. 2012. Total segment revenues increased $18.7 million for 2012, as compared to 2011. Revenue in 2012 was also decreased by $6.5 million due to the impact of foreign currency translation.According to management remarks in the Q4 2012 conference call, operating margins in 2012 was depressed as substantial operating resources were devoted to grow the international segment. This view proved true as margins rebounded from 7.4% in 2012 to the previous range above 11% in 2013.The AOF & transactions numbers provide a view of the business not affected by currency or one-time expenses. In 2012, AOF increased by 3.4% and transactions increased by 17.3%. In 2013, AOF increased by 8.4% and transactions increased by 19.9%.Merchant ServicesThis segment provides merchant billing services, authorization and capture of transactions, clearing and settlement of transactions, information reporting services related to transactions, merchant billing services, and point-of-sale equipment sales and service to clients. Revenues from merchant services include processing all payment forms including credit, debit, prepaid, electronic benefit transfer and electronic check for merchants of all sizes. Below is a summary of the Merchant Services segment:On August 8, 2012, TSYS completed its acquisition of 60% of CPAY for $66 million in cash. On December 26, 2012, TSYS completed its acquisition of ProPay for $123.7 million. Both of these companies have been integrated into TSYS' Merchant Services segment. As a result, the 16.9% jump in operating income is inorganic growth caused by the two acquisitions.Management has been restructuring the Merchant Services segment since 2010 by shifting from third-party processing and entering into direct relationships with merchants. In the 2013 Q4 conference call, management notes that the transition is now reaching its sweet spot of consistent growth:NetSpendNetSpend was acquired in February 2013 at an enterprise value of $1.4 billion.The NetSpend segment is a program manager for FDIC-insured depository institutions that issue General Purpose Reloadable (GPR) cards and payroll cards and provide alternative financial services to under-banked consumers in the United States. The NetSpend segment's revenues primarily consist of a portion of the service fees and interchange revenues received by NetSpend's prepaid card Issuing Banks in connection with the programs managed by this segment. Cardholders are charged fees for transactions including fees for PIN and signature-based purchase transactions made using their prepaid cards, for ATM withdrawals or other transactions conducted at ATMs, for balance inquiries, and monthly maintenance fees among others. The NetSpend segment also earns revenues from a portion of the interchange fees remitted by merchants when cardholders make purchase transactions using their cards.The following image taken from a TSYS presentation breaks down NetSpend's distribution network:The following image taken from TSYS's 2014 Analyst Day demonstrates NetSpend's consistent growth:My view:It is difficult to do a valuation comparison because TSYS' three main competitors are private. Nevertheless, EPS is expected to grow 12% in FY 2014 to 1.91. At its current price of 31.5, TSS is trading at 14.2x 2015 estimated EPS.TSYS' North America Services and NetSpend segments have demonstrated a trend of consistent revenue and income growth. The Merchant Services is about to yield the benefits of restructuring and the International Services segment is also growing once currency effects are taken into account. Due to TSYS' double digit EPS and revenue growth, I expect TSS shares to outperform financial stocks in the long run."
4180825,101421,2018-06-11T13:48:28-04:00,TSYS has acquired iMobile3 for an undisclosed sum.iMobile3 has developed private-labeled payment processing software for small and medium businesses.The deal will bolster TSS' push into providing an extended menu of payment-related services to SMBs in the United States.,"TSYS (TSS) has announced the acquisition of iMobile3 for an undisclosed amount.iMobile3 has developed as a leading provider of unique and customizable payment solutions, including mobile and tablet point-of-sale products integrated with additional services.TSS acquired iMobile3 for its mobile-centric approach and capabilities to offer SMB merchants additional services, including digital marketing and analytics.The Jacksonville, Florida-based company was founded in 2009 to provide its customers with custom mobile and Web applications, and mobile point of sale (mPOS) solutions that support a range of mobile payment terminals, processors, and encryption technology.Management is headed by CEO and Managing Partner Bob Leonard, who was previously a Founder and President of Florida Technology, President of Encore Development and Director of Product Marketing for Symantec.The acquired company’s primary offerings include:Company partners include Factor4 and Elo Touch.According to a 2018 market research report by Statista, the Digital Payments market is projected to amount to $3.265 trillion in 2018 and is projected to reach $5.411 trillion by 2020.This represents a CAGR of 13.5% between 2018 and 2022.The main drivers for this expected growth are the increase in the use of mobile wallets, the on-demand economy requiring faster transaction processing rates, and the increased adoption of fingerprint scanning to make mobile payments potentially more secure. (Source: SpendEdge)In 2018, the highest value worldwide by total transaction volume was reached in China, followed by United States, United Kingdom, Japan and, finally, Germany.Major competitive vendors that provide mobile payment processing solutions include:(Source: Owler)TSS didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn’t file an 8-K or disclose a change in financial guidance, so the deal was likely for a non-material amount.The firm’s most recent 10-Q filing indicates that as of March 31, 2018, it had $493 million in cash and total liabilities of $5.0 billion.TSS acquired iMobile3 for its leading private-labeled (white label) capabilities for the SMB (small and medium business) market in the United States.As TSS stated in the deal announcement,In the past 12 months, TSS’s stock price has risen 47% as the chart below indicates:(Source: SEEKING ALPHA)By comparison, the S&P 500 Index has risen approximately 13%, so TSS' appreciation has dramatically outpaced the benchmark.Although the deal for iMobile3 apparently was a small one, it adds engineering talent and expertise in the white label space that will assist TSS in ‘becoming the number one payments solutions provider to small and medium size businesses in the U.S.’My belief is that acquisition was driven by a desire on the part of TSS to develop a robust offering in the mobile- and tablet-centric space.By acquiring iMobile3, TSS is signaling an increased interest in mobile- and tablet-oriented point-of-sale processing, perhaps as competitive response to inroads being made by companies like Square (SQ).Square has been busy building vertical networks of merchants, e.g., restaurants, by providing them with extended service offerings outside traditional payment processing, including marketing, analytics and delivery coordination.iMobile3’s focus on providing solutions to the SMB market will help TSS bolster its SMB products and may act as a catalyst for TSS to begin extending service offerings beyond transaction processing and into digital marketing and analytics as well."

I think Total System shareholders should vote in favor of the offer.","Total System Services, Inc. (NYSE:TSS) has plenty of growth potential going forwards, but the stock is quite expensive and has rallied strongly this year. Global Payments has made a takeover offer which will provide Total System's shareholders with 0.8101 Global Payments shares for each share they own. The deal will need shareholder approval and I would vote in favor.Total System has produced solid growth over the last decade with more growth expected heading into 2020. The company operates profitably with a profit margin averaging around 12% and a return on equity averaging around 20%.The balance sheet shows that Total System operates with fairly high debt levels. The company's long-term debt is $4.3 billion which represents 55% of its total asset value and its total liabilities represents 70% of its total asset value. The company has shown an increasing debt trend. A decade ago, the company's total liabilities was only 31% of its total asset value and has steadily increased year on year to the present 70%. I personally don't like companies with increasing debt trends as this increases the bankruptcy risk.While Total System's long-term debt is high, the company operates with ample working capital (with a current ratio of 2.2) meaning that its short-term assets (such as cash and deposits) easily cover its short-term liabilities (bills the company has to pay).Based on earnings from net income (rather than operational), Total System' 2020 forward PE multiple is 30x with a stock price of $123. The company's full year trailing PE multiple is 38x and its book value multiple is 9.2x. These multiples imply that Total System is expensive. The company pays a dividend with a forward yield of 0.51% and a trailing yield of 0.42%. The dividend payout ratio is 16%, which is on the low side as most dividend paying company's payout more than this (usually around 30% or more).Total System has a history of revenue growth which has averaged 10% per year over the last decade. The chart below visually shows Total System's revenue and earnings trend over the last decade along with the next two years of consensus forecasts. The earnings per share used are net income (they are not operational earnings which some forecasts state).Total System's data by ADVFNAs the above chart shows, Total System's revenue has increased over the last decade, but did fall in 2018 after two strong years of increases. The forecasts show the revenue increasing into 2020. The company's earnings have broadly trended higher with the analysts expecting more growth heading into 2020.Total System has a history of growth with its revenue increasing an average of 10% per year and its earnings increasing an average of 13% per year over the last decade. The analysts are expecting the company's earnings to increase 10% heading into 2020. The PEG (PE divided by the earnings growth rate) can be used to arrive at a valuation based on its expected earnings growth.Using the forecast earnings growth rate of 10% gives a forward PEG of around 3.0 with a 2020 PE multiple of 30x.It's commonly accepted that a stock is fairly valued when its forward PEG is 1.0 which means that Total System is overvalued with a stock price of $123. Its fair value would be around $40.Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) has signed a deal to acquire Total System. In the deal, shareholders of Total System will receive 0.8101 Global Payments for each share they own. There's no cash component to the offer.With a current stock price of $154.04 for Global Payments, the deal is currently worth $124.76 (0.8101 shares x $154.04), but the value of the offer is variable as it's tied to Global Payments stock price. If Global Payments stock price goes up then the value of the offer goes up and vice versa.Personally I prefer takeovers with cash offers, as then at least I have a fixed value for the deal. This takeover is really more of a merger, as Total System shareholders will own shares in Global Payments if they hold onto their Total System shares.Total System currently has a market cap of nearly $22 billion and Global Payments market cap is currently around $24 billion. This will take Global Payments market cap to $46 billion, with the existing Total System shares representing 48% of Global Payments new market cap.While the available information about the deal is limited, at present it appears to be a proposal which would require shareholder approval from both companies. Following that, there'll be the usual regulatory approvals process.The reason for the merger hasn't been stated as each company is currently tight lipped, but I suspect it's about the notion of a bigger company is better than a smaller company. While each company is in itself a large-cap company with a market cap over $20 billion, the combined company will be able to offer a broader range of services as both companies operate in the financial services field of electronic payment processing. In general, larger companies have larger budgets and have more marketing power and I think this is Global Payments motive for the merger.As far as to whether it's a good deal for Total System shareholders, I think it's more a question of whether they want to be Global Payments shareholders. I don't see any reason to buy Total System shares at the moment as there's no profit potential (Total System's stock price will move up and down with Global Payments stock price). If I wanted Global Payment shares, I would wait until the takeover is completed. On the question of whether I think Total System shareholders should vote in favor of the deal, I would vote Yes. The reason I yes is because the stock is quite expensive and if the deal fails, Total System's stock price could take a decent tumble.Total System's stock chart is shown below giving investors a feel for how the stock has performed over the last decade, along with the current reaction to the takeover offer.Total System's chart by StockCharts.comOver the last decade Total System's stock price trended higher to peak in 2018 where the stock pulled back along with the pullback in the stock market. After bottoming in late 2018, the stock rallied along with the rally seen in the stock market so far this year. The current rally is especially strong, being fueled by the takeover offer. The stock has rallied 60% this year and from a technical viewpoint it looks overbought and due for a pullback. If the takeover bid fails, then the stock is ripe for a significant pullback.In the short-term the stock price is tied to Global Payment's stock price which is currently $154.04 making the takeover worth $124.76, but this is a variable price as it will change along with changes in Global Payment's stock price. Currently Total System's stock price of $123.53 is around a dollar below the current takeover value.Total System is the subject of a takeover offer from Global Payments. Under the proposal, Total System shareholders will receive 0.8101 Global Payments for each share they own. There's no cash component to the offer. Total System shares will represent 48% of Global Payments new market cap.The value of the deal is variable as it's tied to the stock price of Global Payments. At present, the deal is worth $124.76 which is around a dollar more than Total System's current stock price.The deal is currently a signed proposal which would require shareholder approval. Personally I would vote in favor of the deal as Total System's stock is quite expensive. If the deal doesn't go ahead, Total System's stock price is at risk of a significant pullback as the stock is currently overbought and would ordinarily be due for a pullback. At present I don't think its worthwhile buying Total System's stock, but I think existing shareholders should hold."

This is S&P 500 component that does not get much recognition but has built a multi faceted business both providing payment solutions and processing for merchants but also serving customers that avoid traditional banks.The company used to be a slow grower hobbling along at the end of the prior decade but a few smart and timely acquisitions has transformed the company into one that is blazing ahead with double digit top and bottom line growth.Let's take a look.Company IntroductionTotal Systems Services(TSS) is a payment processor, merchant acquirer, and provides a variety of other payment related services.One of its key capacities is as a merchant acquirer. The Shaw Group, a consulting firm in this sector, defines that as: TSS is one of the top 10 largest companies in this segment, perhaps top 5 after all the consolidation that has gone on. Among the company's other activities, they also act as a prepaid debit card issuer and processor through their NetSpend subsidiary. This subsidiary was acquired in 2013 for $1.4 billion.This segment also provides payroll services and other bank-like services for customers that may be outside the banking system and small businesses.TSS also offers point of sale solutions, think cash registers, card scanners, etc., and other merchant solutions like online card acceptance and processing.Recent ResultsPrior to 2013 and the acquisition of net spend, top line revenue growth for TSS was relatively benign. 2009 saw a 13% drop in revenue while the next 4 years revenue grew only 1-2%.After the NetSpend acquisition and a few smaller ones, growth really started to pick up for the company. In 2013 and 2014 revenue grew 14%. 2015 was close with 13.6% growth.EPS grew $.75 or so of a $1 base with EPS jumping $150 million since 2009 as well.Margin wise, net profit margin's for the company have stayed remarkably consistent at 12-13%.Compared to the big guys like Visa(NYSE:V) and Mastercard(NYSE:MA) with profit margins in the 40-50% range this seems dismal, but they are in different businesses despite all being part of the payments ""sphere"".Capital ReturnsAs net income and EPS have grown, the company has returned most of their cash to shareholders via buybacks and has not put much priority on its dividend. The dividend has been flat at $.40 per year since 2011.2009 share count has been reduced by 7.14%. Not a terribly impressive feat considering it has been 8 years but nonetheless positive.Additional capital returns have been deployed for acquisitions with the help of debt. NetSpend appears to have worked out quite well.Next on the list is the February 2016 acquisition of TransFirst.TransFirst cost the company $2.5 billion or roughly 1/4 of their current market cap.TransFirst was a similar company that provided merchant solutions for small and medium size businesses. This transaction will help TSS get more exposure to that segment of merchants.The performance and integration of this acquisition will be key to TSS's results going forward.2017 Outlook & ValuationWith the big TransFirst acquisition closed, the company gave the following outlook for 2017. Double digit earnings growth is certainly impressive no matter what.The stock trades at 23 times 2017 earnings using the GAAP numbers. It looks like a screaming bargain if you use the made-up non-gaap numbers, but I will not.Other comparisons include a P/S ratio of 4-5 times. First Data(FDC) trades at 1.1 times sales although these companies are not comparable as First Data has run losses for many years as it is weighed down by a huge debt load that destroys any operating profit it posts.Global Payments(NYSE:GPN), a much better comparison, trades for close to a similar P/S and a forward PE of 17 times. Its profit margins are 5% lower than TSS.It has an average FCF to PE ratio of 18.5 times.With increased exposure to small and medium sized businesses, especially in America, I can see TSS being a benefit vicariously if small businesses get some help whether it is through healthcare law changes, tax relief, or regulation changes.If any of those come through the TransFirst acquisition may turn out to have been well timed.Any good US news or continued US economic strength is good news for TSS as it has a very large presence here across its 3 business lines.I think given management's projected 2017 growth rate, TSS looks attractive here although I acknowledge there is no much room for error with regards to the TransFirst acquisition here.Beyond 2017 it is difficult to project what earnings and revenue will be for almost any company. If the growth rate, earnings wise, falls below double digits I think that today's price would be a big mistake. How long the company can keep up its current and projected pace will have a large impact on your return on investment, as share buybacks and dividends remain minimum while management focuses on using FCF to reduce debt.Q3 earnings noted that the company reduced $300m year to date in debt and is clearly focused on that after the acquisition closed.For myself and others who have exposure to the consumer payments market via Paypal(NASDAQ:PYPL) and also the credit card processors like Visa, TSS is certainly an interesting idea to get at the space from a different angle.At $9b in market cap it is in the lower half of the S&P 500 but nowhere near being kicked out any time soon unless it suffers a 75% drop or more in its price.ConclusionTSS is projected to grow double digits which makes paying above 20times earnings more palatable. What worries many people is that many S&P 500 companies are not growing anywhere near that fast and thus trading close to 20 times earnings for the whole index is seen as expensive.TSS is an interesting way to get payment exposure that is different in business model and nature than Paypal or Visa type companies. It is fairly under the radar despite being a 10b company, has show strong growth the past few years after a few years of 1-2% growth, and is operating in a growing but competitive payment landscape."

(NYSE:TSS)) makes it possible for millions of people to make paperless payments safely and securely. Recognized as the market leader, they provide electronic payment services to financial institutions and companies around the globe. TSS works behind the scenes to offer unmatched flexibility, control and service quality to customers through a broad range of innovative issuing and acquiring payment technologies, including consumer–finance, credit, debit, healthcare, loyalty, prepaid, chip and mobile payments.The dismal economic conditions caused TSS to suffer a rare dip in earnings per share in 2008. This year looks to be on track for a second year-over-year decline. On balance the numbers don’t look too bad and appear to be fully discounted in the share price.Here are the per share numbers as reported by Value Line:* Excludes special dividend of $3.03 /share paid in Dec. 2007 The business is tied to the overall level of credit and debit card transactions so profits should recover nicely once the economy starts expanding again. Value Line notes that TSS has an ‘earnings predictability’ ranking in the 90th percentile (with 100th being best). Standard and Poors assigns TSS a quality rank of ‘A’.Zacks now sees 2009 – 2010 earnings of $1.12 and $1.21 respectively making the multiple about 13.6x this year’s and < 12.6x next year’s expectations. Those are quite low by historical standards as can be seen with just a glance at the chart above.With positive comparisons on tap for 2010 I would guess TSS will see a widening of its P/E back to at least around 15x leading me to a conservative 12 – 18 month target price of $18.15 /share. Morningstar agrees. They rate TSS at 4-Stars (out of 5) and see ‘Fair Value’ as $20 /share.Is that goal price reasonable? I think it may be too conservative. Value Line is using a twenty multiple in figuring their 3-5 year target price range and the lowest annual average P/E of the past decade was the 15.4 multiple set during 2008’s brutal sell-off. TSS actually traded at $22 or better during each year 1998 through 2008. Many of those years saw full year EPS way below current year numbers.Here’s a six-month play that seems set to deliver excellent returns with just moderate risk. You can make a fine profit even if the shares do not go up.If TSS merely stays above $15 through the Feb. 19, 2010 expiration date:That’s a best-case scenario total profit of $2,560/$12,580 = 20.3% achieved in just six months on shares that did not need to rise from the trade’s inception price.What’s the risk?If TSS shares finish below $15 on Feb. 19th, 2010:What’s the break-even point on the whole trade?On the first 1000 shares it’s their $15.18 purchase price less the $1.40 /share call premium = $13.78 /share.On the ‘put’ shares it’s the $15 strike price less the $1.20 /share put premium = $13.80 /share.Your break-even would be $13.79 /share (excluding dividends) and $13.09 /share (including yield).TSS shares could drop by up to $1.39 /share or (-9.1%) without causing a loss on this trade.Disclosure: Author is long TSS shares and short TSS options."
215716,20568,2010-07-21T18:39:55-04:00,,"Total System Services Inc. (NYSE:TSS) is scheduled to report its second quarter 2010 results after the market closes on Wednesday, July 21. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is 23 cents per share, representing a negative growth of about 16% from the year-ago quarter.The credit card regulation is going to impact the number of client accounts and long-term contracts adversely. Hence, we do not foresee any substantial development strategy to drive Total System’s earnings growth in the near term.Previous Quarter PerformanceTotal System’s first quarter operating earnings came in at 26 cents per share, flat with the year-ago quarter. However, they were well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents per share.The surge in profits of Total System was attributable to a slight upside in revenue and the absence of loss of discontinuing operations in the reported quarter. However, this was partially offset by higher-than-expected cost of services and reduction in accounts on file.Total revenue reached $415.4 million in the quarter, up 1.6% as against $408.9 million in the year-ago quarter. On a constant currency basis, total revenue was $409.5 million, reflecting a 0.1% increase from the year-ago quarter. Reimbursable items increased 11.5% year over year to $70.8 million. Except the revenues from North America, the segments of merchant acquiring services and international services posted increased revenues in the quarter.Guidance for 2010Total System updated its guidance for the fiscal year 2010 in the first quarter and expects income from continuing operations of $189−$194 million or 96−98 cents per share (down 12%−14% year over year). The company also projects revenues in the range of $1.71 billion to $1.75 billion (up 1%−3% year over year), with reimbursable items in the range of $279–$284 million (up 3%−5% year over year).In addition, the acquisition of 51% of First National Merchant Solutions LLC is expected to contribute $95−$97 million to the company’s total revenues, $2−$3 million to net income, and approximately 1 cent per share to basic earnings in fiscal 2010.Total System’s guidance for 2010 includes the impact of de-converted portfolios, price compression, reduction in one-time termination fees and currency impact, and the current economic environment of the credit card market.Earnings Estimate Revisions – OverviewAhead of the earnings release, we do not see much variation in analyst estimates over the past 30 days. A similar trend is seen over the past 7 days. Hence, the estimate revision trends and the magnitude of such revisions justify no major changes in the sentiment for the stock.Agreement of AnalystsIn the last 30 days, none of the analysts have revised their estimates for the second or the third quarter, or for fiscal 2010 or 2011 either, thus providing no directional movement. This implies that the analysts are neutral on the outlook and do not foresee any upward catalyst or downward pressure on the result.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsIn the last 30 days, there has been no change in the earnings estimate for the second quarter, third quarter and fiscal 2010 as seen from the magnitude of the Consensus Estimate trend. Estimate for fiscal 2011 moved down by a penny from earnings of $1.06 per share to $1.05. Therefore, the analysts expect the company to report in line with their estimates.The limited number of changes to estimates also indicates that there were no major catalysts during the quarter that could drive results. Consequently, analysts are sticking to the post first-quarter earnings estimates."
1551612,51972,2013-07-16T16:56:17-04:00,,"IntroductionTotal System Services (NYSE:TSS) is a $4.81 billion electronic payment firm that facilitates transactions between consumers, financial institutions, and non-financial organizations. Founded in 1983, it operates globally with three business segments: North American Services (51.0%), International Services (21.9%), and Merchant Services (21.71%). The North American Services segment supplies issuer account solutions for financial institutions and other companies primary based in North America. The International Services segment provides the same facilities, but to associations outside of the US. The Merchant Services Segment delivers issuing and payment technologies to clients primarily based in the US. The firm's services cover card issuing/payment platforms of consumer-finance, credit, debit, loyalty packages, prepaid programs, and mobile.The firm's price at $25.72 is sitting quite close to its 52 week high of $25.87, yet still has potential to grow:TSS price vs. SP500 - Indexed at 23 (7/15/2011), Source: FactSetSince the company's inception, it has consistently grown its top and bottom lines, demonstrating a great play for a core portfolio. The firm's indicated dividend yield is at an attractive 1.6%, and yet the stock's price has been undervalued from an institutional perspective at only 72.1% institutional ownership (Lionshares). Once the larger players in the market see the value in TSS, the price will only climb higher.CatalystsIn terms of the street's outlook of this stock, there are conflicting views of where the price should lie. Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock from ""Neutral"" to a ""Sell"" 8 days ago and estimates vary wildly (StreetInsider). Overall, I believe that the market is overly conservative concerning key earnings drivers: residual losses overshadowing a positive outlook, and cautionary value regarding a recently completed acquisition of NetSpend (NASDAQ:NTSP).Total System Services's last fiscal quarter produced less than stellar earnings and sales from lingering negativity. A large reduction in earnings ($58.82 mil from $60.68 mil) for 1Q2013 was due to residual card contract losses from ABN Amro Bank and Bank of America (-$7.5 mil) converting to other card competitors. Both de-conversion processes ended in 2012, yet had lasting results until the middle of this year. After the most recent earnings call, the stock's price was slammed by -7% (in one month) by short-sighted investors. Looking forward, the company will no longer feel these adverse effects for the remainder of the 2013 period. Since the worst is over, EPS and price figures will rise accordingly.In addition to outstanding losses in 1Q2013 the company had price reductions in relation to transactional card services for Bank of America, lowering sales by $4.3 mil. However, these price reductions were due to an increase in number of contracts won, adding approximately 100+ million new global card accounts over the next year. In essence, the company lowered revenues now in order to make considerably more in the future. With lost contracts settling and an abundance of new contracts coming in, the company will see both higher sales and earnings for the long-haul.Total System Services has been busy with a handful of horizontal acquisitions in 2013. ProPay and CPay have cumulatively added 4.4% to the company's top line by expanding TSS's customer base. However, the business really kicked into gear on July 1st when it completed its $1.4 bil acquisition of NetSpend. NetSpend adds an additional business line of payroll card payment systems. Management has forecasted satisfactory guidance of low teens for sales growth from NTSP, but as most of NetSpend's quarterly sales ($117 mil) transition into TSS's, revenue numbers will increase by roughly 20% (1Q2013 Earnings Call, TSYS). Furthermore, the synergies from this low-debt acquisition will allow for TSS to cross-sell products to its existing client base and effectively drive sales higher. Overall, the company is starting to produce a sound revenue stream and has its hands in many diversified jars.Financials and ValuationThe most attractive part of Total System Services is its strong financial valuation. Sales and earnings have shown extremely consistent growth and stability. When compared to a simple time series, both are incredibly linear with a correlation coefficient of ~0.9:Sales and EPS Figures with Least Squares Fit Regression, Source: FactSetLooking at the quarterly EPS surprise history of the company, an investor can see that it has consistently beat pessimistic broker predictions over the past 4 years. The last two periods of negative surprises have produced buying opportunities as the firm realigns:Surprise History with Green/Red dots as Reported EPS and Bars as Projected, Source: FactSetThe firm is cheap with comparing size and valuation ratios to it's competitors:Size Metrics of the Firm to Competitors, Source: Factset, HooversValuation Metrics of the Firm to Competitors,Source: Factset, HooversConclusionTSS is currently trading at 13.57x EV/EBIT and 9.16x EV/EBITDA, with its competitors' averages residing at 15.34x and 11.74x respectively. Only 4.80% of the firm's enterprise value is debt with an extremely low current ratio near 0.13. With such small debt, the main appreciator of an increase of EV is price. An appropriate EV multiple valuation would push the stock price into the high-twenties. Overall, FY1 EPS is projected to grow by 1.43% and have a price target at 17.79x (FactSet Estimates). This suggests a stock value around the mid-twenties. Taking all metrics into consideration, I'd put a long term price target at $28, trading at roughly 15x EV/EBIT and 19.5x earnings.With the firm's increase in new accounts, additional acquisitions, and rock-solid financial statements, Total System Services will proceed to climb in value.Disclosure: I am long TSS.

48181,20502,2007-09-25T09:13:17-04:00,,"Last week I added another ""starter position"" in a high quality company to my portfolio:Total System Services (NYSE:TSS). I would have liked to use a covered call strategy with this stock, but there are no leaps available, and the shorter term options are quite illiquid. I hope the TSS options will attract more volume in the future.TSS provides electronic payment processing and associated services to institutions around the globe (e.g. US, Mexico, Canada, Europe, Honduras, Puerto Rico etc.). The company charges based on the number of accounts on file, transactions processed, statements mailed etc. Here are some of the things I like about TSS:1) High quality company. The S&P Quality rating is A+.2) Stealth china play. In December 2005, TSS acquired a 34% equity stake in China UnionPay Data Co. (CUP Data), the data processing subsidiary of China UnionPay which is China's largest bankcard processor. In August, 2006 they raised their stake in CUP Data to 44.6%. In July 2006, they also acquired Card Tech, a London-based payment processing firm which expands their reach into the Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa regions. TSS also does business in Brazil. Credit card and debit processing is just starting out in many regions of the world, but should have impressive growth going forward.3) Clients. The TSS stock price has been depressed because they lost a major client- JP MorganChase (NYSE:JPM), which is taking their credit card processing in-house (Jamie Dimon has always been a big believer in bringing strategic technology in-house- it was not caused by poor service on the part of TSS). But TSS has since gained other business to compensate and over the long term has tremendous growth potential in China and other emerging market countries.4) Ownership: Synovus Financial (NYSE:SNV) owns 81.1% of TSS and also looks like a pretty attractive investment. One potential negative (for TSS) is that Synovus management is considering a distribution of their TSS shares to SNV shareholders which could cause some short-term selling by SNV investors who do not want to own TSS separately. But I believe this ""overhang"" problem is already reflected in the share price of TSS.5) TSS has attractive returns: Return on assets=15.15% Return on Equity =21.7%. These numbers have been generated with virtually no debt. (Debt/Equity = 0.012)6) Good sponsorship: Some large holders of the stock (aside from Synovus) are: Goldman Sachs, Renaissance Technologies and Fidelity Low Price Fund (Joel Tillinghast)."

(NYSE:TSS) reported first quarter operating net income of $48.8 million or 25  cents per share, against $51.8 million or 26 cents per share in the  year-ago quarter. However, earnings per share were in line with the  Zacks Consensus Estimate.Results reflect continued weakness in North America services and  higher-than-expected cost of services and selling, general and  administrative (SG&A) expenses that also led to the decline in  earnings. These were partially offset by increased same client  transactions, lower taxes and slight increase in overall transaction  volume.Total revenue for the reported quarter was $429.4 million, up 3.9% as  against $413.5 million in the year-ago quarter. However, this was a tad  lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $431.0 million.Excluding termination fees of $23.1 million in the first quarter of  2010, total revenues witnessed a 10.0% year over year growth. On a  constant currency basis, total revenue was $426.0 million, reflecting a  3.0% increase from the year-ago quarter. Reimbursable items totaled  $66.8 million, down 5.7% year over year.As per segments, quarterly revenues from North America declined 9.3%  year over year to $230.6 million, while revenues from international  services witnessed a 14.0% year-over-year growth to $90.7 million.  Besides, intersegment revenues deteriorated 1.6% year over year to a  negative of $7.6 million.However, revenue from merchant acquiring services climbed substantially -- 32.6% year over year to $115.8 million, thereby rising from 21% to 27% of consolidated total revenues. Meanwhile, organic growth in the reported quarter stood at 3.9%.Total System reported a 27.1% year over year surge in SG&A  expenses, which came in at $54.9 million. In addition, cost of services  increased 3.8% year over year to $301.5 million.Operating income plummeted 8.4% year over year to $73.0 million in the  reported quarter. Excluding termination fees in the year-ago quarter,  revenues increased 10.0% while earnings per share increased 35.1%.Total number of accounts on file as of March 31 was 356.7  million, up 10.3% from 323.3 million at the end of the prior-year  quarter. New client growth was offset by a lower internal growth of  existing clients. Additionally, same-client cardholder transaction  volumes increased 9.6% over the prior-year quarter.Financial UpdateAs of March 31, cash flow from operations was $102.2  million, compared with $133.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Cash and  equivalents plummeted to $252.5 million versus $394.8 million at the  end of 2010. While total assets were $1.78 billion at the end of the  reported quarter, total shareholders’ equity was recorded at $1.23  billion.Additionally, during the reported quarter, Total System bought back 2.0 million shares of its common stock under the share repurchase plan. The company has so far repurchased about 5.0 million shares in the past three quarters.Guidance RevisionTotal System reiterated its guidance for 2011, whereby management  projected income from continuing operations in the range of $211-216  million or $1.09-1.11 per share. Total revenues are expected to be  in the range of $1.75-1.79 billion, reflecting a 2-4% year-over-year  growth. Reimbursable items are anticipated to be in the range of $260-267 million, declining 3-5% over 2010.However, revenue from reimbursable items are projected at $1.49-1.52  billion, growing 3-5% over 2010. Besides, excluding the termination  fees in 2010, the revenues before reimbursable items are projected to be  up 6-8%, and net income from continuing operations is projected to be  up 20-22%, in 2011. Average shares outstanding are now expected to be  194.5 million.Business UpdateYesterday, Total System announced that it has renewed its agreement  with Advanzia Bank S.A., the largest issuer of credit cards in  Luxembourg, to process its more than 1.5 million consumer credit card  portfolio.On January 1, Total System expanded its merchant service  solutions by purchasing the remaining 49% of First National Merchant  Solutions LLC (FNMS) for approximately $169.6 million. Following the  complete acquisition, Total System has renamed FNMS as TSYS Merchant  Solutions.Dividend UpdateOn April 1, Total System paid a regular quarterly dividend of 7 cents per share to shareholders of record as on March 17.Our TakeOverall, Total System signals a sluggish improvement in the near-term,  given the inefficient cost-cutting efforts, inadequate diversified  growth, and interest and currency risk. Moreover, the company has been  adversely impacted by the bank consolidation and the slowdown in credit  card transaction growth over the past few years.We expect Total System to incur incremental costs and bear risk as a  result of the new regulations being implemented as a result of the  Consumer Protection Act and other laws that were passed in July 2010.  The company is also vulnerable to increased competition from dominant  players such as Global Payments Inc. (NYSE:GPN) and Alliance Data Systems Corp. (NYSE:ADS).Although the complete acquisition of FNMS and expansion into merchant  acquiring services is expected to drive growth, sole dependence on it  could be risky for the long term growth. In addition, we do not foresee  any other substantial development strategy to drive earnings in the near  future. However, we expect Total System to benefit from the improving  economy and generate healthy cash flow to achieve the guidance for 2011."
46376,20370,2007-09-05T05:13:42-04:00,,"Total System Services (NYSE:TSS) is one of the largest credit card transaction processors in the US. It serves bank and private-label card issuers around the world. Offerings include credit authorization, payment processing, account management, e-commerce services, card issuance, and such customer-relations services as call-center operations and fraud monitoring. Synovus Financial, through subsidiary Columbus Bank and Trust Company, owns more than 80% of TSS. It's the Chinese connection that caught my eye. While it's only 3 banks currently, the potential transactions China represents is extremely large. Of course, there's competition for all that business, but TSS has an established name and strong credibility so it will certainly get its fair share, if not more. In other overseas markets, TSS is beginning to process in Brazil, giving it a stronghold to service all of South America. Another exciting prospect is the prepaid rewards card, a joint venture with Norwich Union in England. TSS will also be processing the new Wal-Mart Money Card issued by GE. There was a test run last year using 2600 Wal-Mart stores. This could develop into a major national program. The one concern for shareholders is the high probability of Synovus Financial Corp. distributing its shares of TSS (it owns 81% of TSS) to Synovus shareholders. Management has asked the board of directors to make this decision. What happens is that the shares now held by Synovus will be given to shareholders of Synovus. Most likely some or many of those new shareholders will want to sell these new shares since they bought Synovus for Synovus, not for TSS. With a large number of shares for sale, the price of the stock will most likely need to go down to a level to attract new buyers. Whether that's a permanent new price or at what price that occurs, will be anyone's guess. But it is a definite negative overhanging the stock. On the positive side, there are some numbers that impress: Net profit margin is 14% with expectations of 15% in the next few years. Return on Equity is 18%, down from 20.5% last year with forecasts for 14% in the next 5 years. Revenues are predicted to grow by 6% a year on average over the next 5 years while earnings should improve by 8.5% a year, on average, in the same time period. The dividend has grown every year for the last 4 years, starting with 8 cents a share in 2003, now at 28 cents a share. Current assets overwhelm current liabilities by more than 3 to 1 with cash at $452 million. Credit card and debit processing will only grow as the world transacts more with plastic and online. Total System Services will facilitate many of those purchases. The near future is a little cloudy with the spin off a real possibility from Synovus Financial. Once those shares find new owners, this stock should do better."

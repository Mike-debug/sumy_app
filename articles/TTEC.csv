Its valuation is optimistic, with a price-implied earnings growth rate of over 1,303%. Finally, its earnings yield doesn't beat the risk-free rate. Let's get into it.Earnings matter. I know for a lot of readers, earnings take a back seat to revenue. But the evidence suggests that earnings are correlated with stock appreciation, and as such, I believe investors will do well to pay attention to earnings.Accounting net income represents the ""bottom-line"" accounting measure of firm performance, and indeed, research links it to positive returns. As Nichols et al. write in the journal Accounting Horizons, earnings impact returns via three links:Indeed, according to Nichols et al., the empirical supports this and suggests that there is a significant relationship between earnings and returns. For example, they find that (emphasis theirs):The evidence suggests that changes in annual earnings contain substantially more value-relevant information than, for example, changes in annual cash flow from operations, reinforcing ""the important consequences of earnings information for share prices, and reveal why capital market participants devote so much time and effort to forecasting earnings.""This brings us to TTEC. TTEC is one of those uniquely situated companies whose sales and earnings, TTM, are significantly correlated - negatively - to a point of -0.73.TTEC Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsWorse, this trend seems to be strengthening. Its total expenses are growing as a percentage of revenue, and are correlated - positively this time! - to a near-perfect point of 0.995.With growing revenue that is nearly perfectly correlated with total expenses, all while earnings stagnate, we must ask the eternal, all-important question: If growing sales won't lead to increased earnings, what will? It's hard to see how this situation will turn around in upcoming quarters.TTEC Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsUncertain margins, with a profit margin of just 0.49% and an operating margin slightly better at 8.15%, TTM, highlights the yuuuge uncertainty of TTEC's future profits. That current profit margin means that just 49¢ of every $100 of sales translates into profits. Any slight uptick in expenses might cause a negative profit margin for TTEC investors, netting a loss with each dollar of sales.Despite these poor earnings, TTEC is priced optimistically. Research suggests that optimism built into stocks causes lower stock appreciation. An article in the journal Review of Accounting Studies states:These inferior returns are caused by poor returns once investors realize the company has disappointed delivering those optimistic expectations:When we look at TTEC's P/E and 1yr forward PE, we find that its P/E is high at 201.88, while its forward 1yr P/E just 15.49. This suggests to me that there is too much optimism built into TTEC's price.Based on the above numbers, the market is assuming a 1,303% increase in TTEC earnings over the next year. From above, we can see that TTEC's earnings growth has not been very impressive, making this price-implied growth rate far too optimistic, in my opinion. And as the research suggests, optimism in earnings forecasts results in sharp declines when those forecasts are not met.For investors looking for bottom line growth that research links to positive stock returns, TTEC may have a difficult time delivering, without some significant operational cutbacks.TTEC has an earnings yield of just 0.50%, with a dividend yield of 1.68%. Investors would be better off looking for returns in a two-year T-Bill, which is yielding about 2.39%. If an investor can get a higher yield from the risk-free rate, in my opinion, it's not worth taking on the excess risk of low-profit, optimistically-priced equities.With earnings that are negatively correlated with revenue, high total expenses almost perfectly correlated with revenue, a yield that doesn't beat the risk-free rate, and a price-implied growth rate north of 1K%, I recommend that investors stay away from TTEC."

Shares are down 8% over the last month, despite upping its full year 2014 revenue guidance. For 2Q, revenue was up nearly 3% y/y and EBITDA was up 8.4% y/y.Since our initial article back in December, shares are up 12%. At the time, TeleTech was trading at 8x EV/EBITDA and 14x forward earnings. That's still where TeleTech trades today. But we're still 16% off our $31 price target. As we noted in December:One of its newest segments, Customer Technology Services, provides clients with an integrated set of social capabilities, mobile applications, multi-channel communication services. This is its big push to SaaS. As of 2Q, this segment had grown to its second largest (of four) segment by revenues. Its balance sheet also remains strong, with $98 million in cash and $107 million in debt. It has some $600 million available under its credit facility."

One of these is TeleTech (NASDAQ:TTEC), an outsourcing services company that focuses on customer management and enterprise management solutions. As companies continue to cut operational costs in order to be more efficient and profitable, outsourcing is a strategy that has a bright future. The closing of call centers by Sprint (NYSE:S) was seen as a major hurdle, but shares have recovered as other business opportunities provide a consistent revenue stream, and the company’s earnings power is underestimated.Shares currently trade 12.6X forward earnings, 0.63X sales, 6.56X free cash flow, and at a PEG of 0.59. Looking at valuation metrics that a potential acquirer would use, TeleTech is insanely cheap at 0.6X Enterprise Value/Revenue and 4.8X EV/EBITDA.The balance sheet is also solid with ample liquidity and a debt to equity ratio of just 0.13, while insiders are 46.58% owners in the company’s shares. TeleTech was recently added to the S&P 600 which will add some institutional ownership in shares, currently at 51%, as index managers have to buy shares for portfolios. Many Analysts that cover TeleTech have a Hold rating on the firm currently, which leaves room for upgrades to help boost shares.On a technical basis, shares are currently at the top of a channel up formation, with $14.50 a possible breakout level, so looking to buy shares on a dip to around $12 is the way to play this stock. Shares traded at $26 in June of last year, and there is no reason we can’t see a move back to those levels, if shares break through $16.40 resistance, which aligns with the 200 week exponential moving average.Disclosure: Looking to Buy shares at $12"

The acquisition of Connextions is a logical extension of our healthcare strategy.”TeleTech will combine Connextions with its Customer Management Services [CMS] segment and restructure the group as needed.The uncertainty around healthcare has yet again risen, with various ACA exchanges showing increased stress due to insurance companies exiting or reducing exposure in light of significant losses.Add to that the current Administration's and Congress’s currently unfinished efforts to dramatically alter the ACA, and TeleTech management may see an opportunity with the acquisition to step into the healthcare vertical more decisively to take advantage of an increased need for consumer information and guidance.TeleTech is focused on assisting businesses to grow their customer relationships, so the Connextions deal is well within its core focus.It’s too soon to tell whether this acquisition will be a success for TeleTech, although I’m optimistic that in the current highly uncertain healthcare environment, the deal will prove profitable in the medium term.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

1920801,41741,2013-12-31T09:32:11-05:00,,"TeleTech Holdings (NASDAQ:TTEC) is a company that operates under the radar in the customer service field. It's certainly not on the radar of many Wall Street firms and has only been covered on SeekingAlpha only once. But the company has been in business for over 30 years.The business was built from the ground up by Founder and CEO Ken Tuchman. He likes to operate under the radar. Doing so has helped make him nearly a billionaire dollars with his 60% stake in the company. And although the company is just now getting back to pre-2009 trading levels, there are a number of key catalysts ahead to drive shares higher. Most notably, being the day CEO Ken Tuchman decides to cash in his chips and cement his billionaire status.However, beyond that, one of the keys that Mr. Market appears to be missing is the company's relatively successful (thus far) transition to a SaaS company. This is coming from reinvestment within the company (leading to organic growth), as well as bolt on acquisitions. The company still has one of the best balance sheets in the business services sector, which will further help support investment, internally and acquisition based.The thing to keep in mind is that we are already seeing the transition to a SaaS company take place. They are no longer just plans, but actions that are yielding margin improvements. Its TTM gross margin of 28.4% is at or near decade highs. As the company sees more growth from its SaaS business, meaning more of its revenues come from this segment, its margins should further grow. SaaS revenues are expected to grow 50% next year, and its SaaS business margins are over 40%.What kind of customer service does TeleTech do?Basically, TeleTech started out as a call center company. From there, the company branched out into consulting, now partnering with its clients to serve their customers. Teletech provides a wide range of business process outsourcing (NYSE:BPO) services in four areas: customer management, direct sales, human capital, and professional services.TeleTech serves approximately 200 global clients in the automotive, broadband, communications, financial services, government, healthcare, logistics, media and entertainment, retail, technology and travel industries. The company looks to enter into long-term relationships with its clients, which provides for a steady revenue stream. The top five clients have been with TeleTech for periods ranging from six to 17 years and have completed multiple contract renewals with TeleTech. The client retention rate last year was 92%.The company completed its IPO in 1996 and since that time, revenues have grown from $183 million in 1986 to $1.17 billion last year. This represents a CAGR of 12.3%. About 21% of its revenues come from its customer-centric strategy and growth or technology-based services. The balance, or 79%, comes from its traditional customer management services (call center operations).Still going strong3Q was a fairly solid quarter for the company, except for a negative impact related to foreign currency. Normalized operating margin for the quarter was 9.8%. The company completed the acquisition and integration of WebMetro.For the first three quarters of this year, the company signed an additional $285 million in contract value, an increase of 23% over the same period last year. TeleTech signed $80 million in new business for 3Q and attracted 15 new clients to its growing roster of high profile brands. Of the $80 million signed, the revenue mix consisted of 80% from existing clients, 66% in recurring revenues, 50% from emerging business and 21% from international clients.Despite a storied history of revenue growth, it's time to transition for future growthTeleTech has been making the transition to become more of a SaaS provider. The company has already built a technology-enabled service platform that includes all the elements of social media, mobile, analytics and cloud services.The new step is to combine all aspects of sales, marketing and customer service for its customers. CEO Ken Tuchman addressed this on the company's earnings call (emphasis ours).The key to Tuchman's statement is that this will not be an overnight process. As well, it will require investment, but TeleTech has the balance sheet for it. Its long-term debt to equity is only 25%, while the business services industry has an average LT/debt ratio of 100%. The other big positive about TeleTech's balance sheet strength is that it is very advantageous for making key acquisitions to further grow its SaaS platform (more on this later).Its new key segment is called Customer Technology Services. As of last quarter, and for the third quarter in a row, this segment delivered double-digit growth. By the end of this year, this segment will have grown almost 50% over last year.Growth for this segment is due to TeleTech providing its clients with an integrated set of social capabilities, mobile applications, multi channel communication services and robust analytics that are hosted on a scalable and flexible cloud platform. We've always knew that SaaS is a fast flowing market and platform, this just further confirms it.And what makes TeleTech so great is that it helps their clients link disparate systems in the cloud and create common data architecture that enable a 360-degree view of individual customer relationships. CFO Regina Paolillo discussed new SaaS segment on the earnings call (emphasis ours).In addition to customer tech services, the company is seeing serious growth from its Customer Strategy Services business. This segment is described as an emerging business for the company and saw revenue growth of 14.5% in 3Q. What this segment does is provide strategic consulting services to TeleTech's clients, another high-margin business. This allows the company to provide value-added services at higher margins. This segment keeps the customer engaged and provides a one-stop shop for the client's customer service capabilities.On the company's earnings call, CEO Ken Tuchman outlined his 4-prong growth approach (emphasis ours).Future growth should be gas pedaled by continued M&ALast year, TeleTech made four acquisitions and we see the pace picking up going forward. The company purchased OnState Communications Corporation, iKnowtion LLC, Guidon Performance Solutions and Technology Solutions Group, Inc. On the earnings call, CEO Ken Tuchman said:To fund acquisitions, the company has a net cash position of $15.5 million and $579 million available under its existing line of credit. Since January of 2012, TeleTech has deployed $255 million in share buybacks, acquisitions and capital expenditures.Continued share repurchasesSince the company implemented its share repurchase program, TeleTech has repurchased more than $563 million of its shares. This is impressive considering that the company's market cap is only $1.19 billion. For the first three quarters of this year alone, TeleTech repurchased 2.3 million shares for $52 million. The company currently has $24 million (just under 2% of its market cap) authorized and available on its current program and we see the company continuing to be an active buyer of its own stock.Not priced for growthThe biggest issue with TeleTech is that Mr. Market is failing to price the company based on its future growth prospects. While the customer service business is extremely competitive. TeleTech competes with Accenture (NYSE:ACN) and Convergys (NYSE:CVG) In seeing how all three stack up, we see:Notice that TeleTech trades the lowest on a P/E and P/S basis. And despite the recent slowing in growth, going forward, growth is expected to kick back in. EPS is expected to come in at $1.37 for this year and jump to $1.66 next year. Of the five firms covering the stock, three have it rated as a Strong Buy and two a Buy. Price targets range from $27 to $32 with $31 being the median target, or upside of 35%.SaaS companies have taken on the shape of a variety of companies these days. Application software companies are generally considered the stable of the SaaS industry, and while TeleTech trades at 18x earnings, the average for the application software industry is 32x earnings. And while TeleTech has some room to go with margins (its current NPM is right at 5%, while the average application software company is at 15%), it's already there in terms of ROE, churning out a 15% ROE over the TTM -- in line with the application software industry.Even if we assume virtually no multiples expansion, there's still impressive upside for TeleTech. Putting a 19x earnings multiple on 2014E EPS of $1.66 suggest that TeleTech should be trading over $31/share in a year.Customer concentration riskThe biggest risk for TeleTech is its contracts and concentration of revenues. Its five largest clients accounted for 39% of revenues in 2012 and 37% in 2011. The top 10 accounted for 57% in 2012 and 56% in 2011. The contracts with the five largest clients all expire between 2014 and 2016. Likewise, if any of TeleTech's customers merge or are acquired, there are provisions in the contract where they could opt out. While we feel the strength of TeleTech's customer service offerings are the best in the business, circumstances beyond TeleTech's control could have an adverse impact on revenues.Bottom lineThe move toward becoming more of a SaaS company should continue to be a natural progression, and extension, of their business. Investors should expect continued growth for TeleTech as it transitions to higher margin SaaS business. The move is already in full swing and it plans to continue making bolt-on acquisitions that will ultimately lead to margin expansion.On the other side, TeleTech would be a great bolt-on acquisition for the likes of Accenture. The company could also be a merger candidate with Convergys, which is only slightly bigger. Either way, we see further upside for shares of TeleTech as it has the cheapest valuation among peers and could also see multiple expansion as margins expand and it better brands itself as a SaaS company. Look for shares to trade to $31 over the next 12 to 18 months, or 35% upside from today's prices.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company manages 200 individual websites focused on different subsectors of technology. These sites feature product selection advice, technology tips, white papers, and other relevant information. The material on these sites is a combination of content produced by TechTarget’s editorial staff and well as product collateral submitted by technology vendors. In order to see all of this content, users must register with TechTarget. TechTarget gauges the buying intent of these users by how many times and for how long they visit each site, and by what they look at on that site. This powerful buying intent information is then passed on to TechTarget’s customers so they can know which firms are looking to make a technology purchase and with what urgency.TechTarget’s business model has powerful operating leverage. With high (77%) gross margins and mostly fixed operating costs, the revenue drop-down to EBITDA is impressive with a 50-70% incremental EBITDA margin. In 2019 incremental EBITDA margins were even higher, near 90%. The company is forecasting a 50% incremental EBITDA margin for 2020 but it has been known to be conservative in its forecasts.Competition for TechTarget is virtually nonexistent as it is a niche business which has taken years to build. To duplicate all of the company’s websites and content would take a very long time. Much easier for a larger player to come in and purchase TechTarget. The company is very well managed with the CEO and the Chairman both at the company for many years and having achieved much success with the business.The company is not reliant on Google for its web traffic. 94% of the company’s traffic is organic and most users know the company’s sites well and visit there directly. Google’s proposed discontinuation of cookies on Chrome plays to TechTarget’s advantage as the company has very little reliance on cookies as compared to other small players in the industry.15% of the company’s business is branding, where customers either place banner ads on its sites or sponsor various areas of its web pages. The rest of the business is called IT Deal Alert, which is the intent data sales I mentioned above. Within IT Deal Alert is a product called Priority Engine which merges the company’s intent data into its customers’ CRM systems, primarily salesforce.com. This business has been growing rapidly, 27% last quarter, and has been driving the 10% overall topline growth for the business.TechTarget recently introduced a new product, Priority Engine Express. While TechTarget has traditionally targeted the top 1,500 tech companies as customers, Priority Engine Express is a scaled down version of Priority Engine focused on the next 5,000 players in the industry. It costs about $30,000 a year versus $90,000 for the fuller Priority Engine product. We think success with this product can accelerate TechTarget’s growth rate beyond the 10% range.While TechTarget’s products were traditionally sold on a quarterly basis the company has been moving towards more predictable annual sales over the past few years. Currently 35% of sales are on an annual basis and the company’s goal is to get to 50% over the next few years.TechTarget is a little-known name and although financial results and stock returns have been good, we feel there is a long way to go. We are forecasting 10% revenue growth in 2020 and an acceleration to 14% revenue growth in 2021 as Priority Engine Express kicks in. This translates to $49m in EBITDA in 2020 and $63m in 2021. Given the 30% growth in EBITDA in 2021 we feel that a 20x multiple is appropriate. This would result in an equity value of $1.3 billion or $45 per share, a 75% increase from current levels."
4189494,104556,2018-07-24T12:50:09-04:00,"TechTarget is a leading provider of enterprise IT information to help buyers and sellers.The company's operating segment, IT Deal Alert, has been a catalyst over the past 5 years.TechTarget trades for a hefty valuation even though financials have been rapidly improving.","TechTarget (TTGT), a small-cap online technology review marketplace, looks to be an interesting investment because of network effects, a seismic business model change, and solid financials.TechTarget is the leading producer of online content in the enterprise IT space. The company employs 175 full-time editors and puts out 75,000 pieces of content annually. Apparently, the site brings in 18 million monthly eyeballs, 97% of those being organic. In short, its content is valuable and there's a lot of it.What this has done is create a double-sided network effect. IT vendors obviously want to sell, so they are forced to list products and make targeted content for TechTarget. This means there is more value for buyers who also leave peer-to-peer reviews to help out other buyers. Then there is more incentive for the vendors to make sure they have good reviews and the cycle continues. This network effect leads to TechTarget sitting on a ton of valuable data. Think of it as Yelp (YELP) but for enterprise IT.Source: Investor PresentationA little before 2013, TechTarget realized the power of the data that it had collected over the prior 14 years. So, the company made a suite of products called IT Deal Alert (ITDA). The premise was to use the purchase intent data from IT buyers and charge IT vendors a monthly subscription for its use so that they could target these buyers.It's like if Yelp started selling subscriptions to restaurants to help them bring in more customers based on customers' dining habits. Hmm… maybe Yelp should pay attention?In the years since, ITDA has been a smashing success. Rather than rely on marketing content fees paid by vendors, TechTarget now uses all of its user-generated data to sell back to the vendors. Think about how valuable that is to vendors. If you knew what your potential customer's buying habits were, you'd be able to predict when and how to sell to them. And TechTarget enables this flow of information.Source: Investor PresentationThe company also predicts that the lines between the two portions of its business, Core Online operations and ITDA, will become blurred. In other words, vendors will leverage content marketing campaigns and data insights to get the most out of their marketing budgets.ITDA is a subscription model, so it allows the company to have more revenue visibility. Though both operating segments are very profitable, ITDA is growing at a much faster rate. As you can see from the chart below, ITDA is becoming an increasingly important driver of the overall business.Source: Investor PresentationIn the latest quarter, revenues grew 17% to just a tad over $27 million. On the surface, 17% doesn't seem like a whole lot but under the covers, ITDA sales shot up 31% and online core sales plodded along, growing 5%. ITDA customer count ballooned to 600 as well, up 30% from 450 a year ago.Source: Investor PresentationGross margins increased in the period to 75%, up from 71%, presumably as a result of more subscriptions added. Adjusted EBITDA, the company's preferred profitability metric, which some investors may not take seriously, grew 105% to over $5 million in the quarter.These rapidly improving financials have resulted in quite a hefty valuation though. The company trades for 140x TTM earnings. On the surface, this seems outrageous, but let's dig a little deeper.Full year guidance for 2018 came in around $123 million. The latest enterprise value is $927 million, suggesting a forward EV/sales ratio of over 7x. High but not terrible. On the EBITDA front, guidance came in around $30 million, which means that company is trading at about 31x forward EBITDA. For a company that is as deeply entrenched in the IT world as TechTarget, the valuation might not be as bad as it previously seemed.Moreover, the company actually buys back its shares. In the last 9 years, share count has decreased 45%. Differing greatly from a typical fast-grower, TechTarget is profitable and it even partakes in share buybacks. There is still about $2.4 million available from the $20 million buyback plan initiated in June of 2016.TechTarget, though it has seen extremely great price action on its stock, still has some risks. For one, ITDA sales have been decelerating. As you can see in the chart above, in the past five years, it grew at a CAGR of 89%. In comparison, its latest growth came in at 31%. Obviously, some of that deceleration is due to the law of larger numbers, but hopefully not because the addressable market is being saturated. At last count, ITDA had 600 customers, a small fraction of the Fortune 5000. Plus, upsell opportunities into products like the Priority Engine can continue ITDA's growth trajectory.Another risk is if the company's core business flames out. The core is still a platform off of which ITDA can grow. If it proves to be old-news, ITDA will most likely have a tough time sustaining this company's valuation on its own.TechTarget is an integral part of IT vendors' marketing plans and IT buyers' decisions. Its value proposition led to rich data insights that it then packaged and now sells to vendors. This resulted in a big business model shift and big price action within the last year. Though there are some questions about its valuation, keep an eye on this one.Author's Note: Please scroll up and hit the big, orange ""Follow"" button so you can get these articles before they hit the paywall.

4242484,24594,2019-02-20T12:42:24-05:00,"After collapsing in the second half, TTGT has rallied in 2019 - and still looks potentially attractive at $16.But broader IT spending trends need to hold up, and there are some potential near-term speed bumps in terms of execution.40%+ off the lows, TTGT looks attractive - but maybe a touch too expensive to be compelling.","TechTarget (TTGT) has been on quite the roller-coaster ride over the last 18 months:Source: finviz.comThere have been two broad factors driving the big move. Sentiment seems to have moved too far - in both directions. Toward the end of the 2017-2018 rally, the market did seem to overreact to TechTarget's growth. I personally sold my shares at $14 in late 2017 - and wrote in June 2018 that something close to perfection already looked priced in. The 60%+ fall from July highs to December lows appears due at least in part to the fact that the July valuations (near 30x EBITDA at one point) simply were unsustainable. A broad decline in small-cap tech that started last summer contributed as well - and a decline that similarly went too far added to the pressure on TTGT in November and December.But TechTarget also earned some of the upside in 1H 2018, and some of the downside in the second half. The company's IT Deal Alert product posted exceptional growth through the first two quarters of 2018, with ""purchase intent"" data driving a shift in the company's entire business model. With incremental EBITDA margins at 50-60%, it's not surprising bullish investors were modeling substantial profit growth. Those investors, again, may have become too aggressive - TTGT fell double-digits even after a solid Q2 report in early August - but the company certainly gave them reasons for optimism.Second-half 2018 results, however, weren't as impressive, particularly in a Q3 that disappointed both external and internal expectations. Even 2019 guidance delivered with this month's Q4 release, while strong, is a touch below where the company seemed to be pointing three months earlier.With the dust settling somewhat, TTGT just shy of $16 still looks potentially attractive. 2019 guidance looks solid. Incremental margins remain impressive. And there's still an intriguing qualitative case here, along with a multi-year path toward growth.But the 40%+ rally from December lows does undercut the case a bit. TTGT is back to pricing in consistent growth. IT customers have been fickle the past few years, raising a near-term risk. And TechTarget still has some work to do, particularly in terms of attracting - and keeping - smaller customers. I like TTGT here, but back near $16 it might take a cheaper price to make it compelling.The fundamental case for TTGT is that multiples are reasonable for the kind of growth TechTarget has posted - and is likely to post. The stock trades just above 12x the midpoint of 2019 EBITDA guidance, and at a low 20s multiple to normalized free cash flow. Both imply reasonable growth - but that's what TechTarget has posted over recent years. EBITDA grew a strong 38% in 2018, and is guided to a 19-22% increase in 2019, continuing a solid multi-year trend:Source: author from TechTarget press releases. 2019 figures at midpoint of guidanceLooking forward, incremental margins help the case for growth. The content on TechTarget's 100+ properties is essentially fixed-cost; higher revenue (whether through larger audiences or better monetization) thus drops to the EBIT and EBITDA lines at very high margins. TechTarget projects 50-60% incremental EBITDA margins - with some talk this year of the figure moving higher - and that range has held over the past few years.With 2019 EBITDA margins overall guided to a bit over 27%, those incremental margins mean revenue doesn't have to grow that fast for earnings to rise. A relatively capital-light model helps the case as well. If TTGT can push revenue consistently higher, it should easily grow into the current valuation - and potentially then some.The qualitative case, meanwhile, is that TechTarget's business model is in the middle of a significant shift. And that shift makes the company a much better, and much improved, marketing partner for its customers - and one that can capture a higher share of customer spend going forward. TechTarget used to be a media company that created content and sold advertising. That model is evolving.TechTarget now is moving toward being a subscription-based business, with one-third of Q4 revenue coming from long-term (1 year-plus) contracts. It's becoming a data company, with IT Deal Alert nearly half of 2018 revenue. The ITDA offering stems from the fact that TechTarget's reach is so broad that it can actually tell by site visitation that specific teams at specific companies are researching certain projects. A new Inbound Converter add-on allows customers to combine their website traffic with TechTarget's purchase intent data, further fine-tuning marketing campaigns.As management put it in the Q4 shareholder letter, ""this is a very different business from our traditional business of selling marketing campaigns"". And it's a much better business: IT Deal Alert revenue rose from $4 million in 2013 to $59 million in 2018. That traditional business - what TechTarget has called ""Core"" - has declined over the same period by about 18%. But the next opportunity comes from the fact that the two businesses actually are merging, to the point that TechTarget no longer will break out the two segments in 2019.In this model, TechTarget becomes an integral part of the marketing process for its IT customers. Priority Engine drives ongoing purchase intent data. When those customers are looking to launch products, generate leads, or push a marketing campaign, they can use TechTarget's traditional offerings to do so. A new ROI Dashboard allows those customers to measure success, and combined with Inbound Converter and the purchase intent data provides substantially greater information about the customers themselves.And all of these revenue streams are based on roughly the same cost of content for TechTarget - making incremental dollars hugely valuable. Net renewal rates are 100%+ for large customers: TechTarget is using the same content, plus some incremental R&D spend, to create more revenue (and more subscription revenue) each year.It's this shift from basic marketing to data-driven selling that drives the case for TTGT here. It's why the stock cleared $30 this summer. It's why 12x+ EBITDA seems reasonable. That shift is in the ""early innings"", per TTGT CEO Mike Cotoia on the Q2 conference call. If it drives consistent revenue growth for the next few years - as it should - TTGT is undervalued.That broad story is quite attractive. But there are some concerns around the edges which, combined with a still-high valuation by small-cap tech standards, could give investors pause - and undercut the rally from December lows.The first is the health of IT spending overall. Cotoia sounded optimistic on the Q4 conference call, citing public cloud, security, and AI among drivers for the overall market over the next few years. But demand has been choppy: Core revenue declined 29% (total) between 2015 and 2017. 2018 did see a rebound to 6% growth, but performance in that segment decelerated in the back half, with just a 1% increase in Q4. Given some help from first-year expense deduction this year, and very easy comparisons, it still looks like the overall trend in terms of traditional marketing spending is negative.That trend was one of my chief worries with TTGT at the highs - and even at a lower price it still represents a headwind to near- to mid-term growth. As Cotoia himself pointed out on the Q3 call, the ""spigots get turned on pretty quickly"" when vendors turn optimistic and are looking to push product. They can be turned off quickly as well.Admittedly, there have been some external impacts. 2016 and 2017 saw a number of mergers in the space which disrupted spending. In the second half, TechTarget has cited the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) in Europe as leading some customers to move more conservatively on the lead generation front. (TechTarget itself shouldn't be affected, as all of its users already have opted in.) Tariffs and the mid-term elections have been cited as well.Looking to 2019, however, external concerns probably will persist. Tariff issues haven't been resolved. If U.S. midterms hit revenue in 2H 2019, the presidential election could start to weigh in the second half of this year and/or 2020. GDPR still is having an impact, per the Q4 call. Macro jitters could hit demand (or TTGT shares, as seen in the second half of 2018).From a broad standpoint, TechTarget should grow by capturing more marketing dollars. But that increased share of spend will be amplified - or reduced - by the absolute size of that spend. And there are some factors in the near term that could lead customers to pullback - while from a long-term standpoint, some major IT vendors (particularly in areas like networking and storage) are showing little or no growth.The final concern on that front is that TechTarget is becoming increasingly dependent on those large customers. After Q2, the company cited much higher churn among smaller, mostly VC-backed, customers. The company made some changes to focus on that cohort that Cotoia said on the Q2 call would lead to improvement ""fairly quickly"". Per the Q4 letter and call, there still is some work to do on that front, with Cotoia noting possible new products to target that group. Increasing penetration among that group - which appear to be over 1,000 of roughly 1,200 customers - provides another growth driver. Without that change, however, TTGT's growth relies on taking more dollars from customers that may not always have dollars lined up to spend.What makes TTGT intriguing - and what explains part of the volatility here - is that it's almost purely a revenue growth story. There are some modest levers to pull in terms of content spending or the size of the salesforce. But TechTarget's model doesn't allow for massive cost cuts or overhauls - and it doesn't seem to require (or benefit from) much in the way of incremental investments. If revenue rises, margins expand; if it falls, they contract. The type of revenue - whether a lead-gen campaign or a Priority Engine subscription - itself seems relatively immaterial.What type of revenue growth is the market pricing in? We can get a rough idea through a sensitivity analysis using 50% incremental margins. That is on the low end of the company's expected range, admittedly. The midpoint of FY19 guidance does suggest a 51% figure, but a tougher first-half comparison and better-than-expected flowthrough in 2018 (64%) probably help. This model may be conservative, but it gives an idea of the compounded annual revenue growth (2020-24) needed to support varying levels of IRR:Implied 5-Year Revenue CAGR Based on Annual Return, Out-Year MultipleSource: author using own calculations, based off midpoint of 2019 guidance. Assumes $60 million in net cash at end of period against current ~$10M, current share count of 28.5 millionFrom here, the market's expectations do look a bit light. 2018 revenue growth was 12%; 2019 is guided to right at 10%. Even a CAGR shy of 8% and 2 turns of EBITDA multiple compression from the current ~12x supports 10% annual returns. Keep multiples intact - or expand them - while driving high-single-digit growth and TTGT is a double. Even mid-single-digit growth makes TTGT a decent investment.But ""a bit light"" isn't quite the same as compelling at this point. And there are some near-term speed bumps as well. Comparisons in Q1 and Q2 are much tougher. The pressure on small-caps last year went too far; the 2019 rally has moved awfully fast as well. And this is a business that basically stalled out from 2014 to 2017, with total revenue growth of 2% and EBITDA margin expansion of just 2%. I don't believe 2018 is an outlier - the data-driven story has real legs - but softer growth in the first half (for which TechTarget itself is guiding) could make it appear that way.The bull case remains intact, and I do like the story. j2 Global (JCOM), which I've long argued is a logical suitor for TechTarget, seems to be recovering, which helps the M&A case. On its own, TechTarget likely can at worst post the type of growth to move the share price higher over the next few years. And with substantial M&A unlikely, shareholder returns should start to ramp over the next few years as well.But TechTarget will need some help from end customers and the macro environment. For substantial upside, it will need a broad market still willing to pay ~25x net income and 13x+ EBITDA for a small-cap tech play. (It's been easy to forget over the past few years, but that market doesn't always exist.) I'd love to see a pullback: $12-13 means mid-single-digit revenue growth likely leads to double-digit annual returns in the stock. Right now, though, the stock is just expensive enough, and worries just large enough, to stay on the sidelines."
4148331,24594,2018-02-20T11:14:37-05:00,"TechTarget's IT Deal Alert is growing strongly, and has propelled TTGT to 100% returns since the beginning of last year.But there are concerns in the core business, and execution hasn't been flawless of late.I liked TTGT last year, but there's enough minor concerns to pass on a still-high valuation.","2017 was a good year for TechTarget (TTGT). But it wasn't a great year, with one notable exception:TTGT data by YChartsChart since January 1, 2017I caught a good chunk of the run, but I sold my position in December, concerned about both valuation and the performance of the company's 'Core' business. TTGT has gained another 22% since then, and now has just about exactly doubled since the beginning of last year.While I'm disappointed in selling too early, I'm also skeptical the company's Q4 earnings report earlier this month changes the case all that much. Q4 was a good quarter - and, again, 2017 was a good year. The IT Deal Alert product is driving enthusiasm toward the stock - and with good reason. But there are questions elsewhere, and valuation looks a bit stretched. Obviously, I wish I'd stayed long past December - but if I had, I'd probably be selling at this point.The story surrounding TechTarget for the past few quarters has been split. The legacy 'Core' business - which uses over 140 specialized websites to sell leads and advertising to IT vendors - has been struggling. The issues started in the second half of 2016, and according to management in part were due to disruption from major mergers at four key customers. IT spending weakened in 2016 as well, leading to reduced marketing budgets across the board.That trend was supposed to reverse in the second half of 2017, as integrations resulting from those major deals were completed - and as TechTarget lapped easy comparisons in Q3 and Q4. But one of my concerns coming out of Q3 was that, while management tried to paint Core's performance as a positive, it looked concerning to me: two-year trends were basically in line with Q1 and Q2, and the absolute number seemed to come in below somewhat confusing guidance given on the Q2 call.On the other hand, the company's IT Deal Alert product was exploding. ITDA is a suite of products based on TechTarget's user data. Its reach in the IT space - 18 million registered members as of the end of 2016 (the 2017 10-K hasn't been filed yet) - is so broad that it can tell if a specific department at a specific company is in the market for a product or service simply from user history. The Priority Engine product from TechTarget then deposits those contacts into Salesforce.com (CRM) or now-private Marketo. Growth has been phenomenal all year - which continued into Q4.The split between the two products is evident in the Q4 and 2017 numbers. IT Deal Alert grew 58% both in Q4 and in the full year. Revenue was $4 million in 2013, and $49.5 million in 2017. But Core revenue fell 16% for the year, and still declined 3% in Q4, despite 6% growth in North America.The catch here is that the two businesses aren't separable; ITDA relies on the Core business's user base. And so this isn't a situation where the company can re-allocate resources or focus from the old business to the new one (or even spin the new one off). Meanwhile, TechTarget had seemed to forecast a roughly 50/50 split between the two businesses, with 3 to 5-year targets of $80-$120 million in both segments at the end of 2016. But it seems unlikely that's how the story actually is going to play out. Whether that's good news or not depends a bit on how an investor views the story here looking forward.In terms of the Core business, the chief takeaway from 2017 is that the long-term trajectory of the business is going to be weaker than management thought a year ago. There is some evidence to the contrary, admittedly. CEO Michael Cotoia on the Q4 call cited ""some positive trends over the last four quarters"" in terms of revenue declines, and said the company was ""cautiously optimistic"" about possibly getting back to growth.The strong dollar has been a headwind that is abating. Tax reform should help as well. While Cotoia on the call forecast the business to be ""down single digits"" for 2018, the company's overall guidance for the year is modeled based on the ""tepid"" IT spending seen in 2017. An acceleration in that spend should imply some upside to current projections for Core.But it's tough to have much confidence at this point. Core revenue has fallen 16% in each of the last two years, and by a total of ~$23.5 million. In the Q3 2016 shareholder letter, the company cited just a roughly $1.6 million impact from the four major customers that quarter. Even annualized, that's less than 30% of the decline. And as for the improving quarterly trends, as I argued after Q3, the improvement is coming mostly from comparisons, as seen when considering two-year stacks:There is some sequential improvement - but not a ton. And given that TechTarget badly missed original guidance for 2016 on a consolidated basis (revenue of $120-$125 million versus actual of $106.6 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $29-$32 million against actual of just $18.5 million), and overshot with both Core and a consolidated basis in 2017, the projections have to be taken with a grain of salt.It's possible the Core business will rebound in 2018, or afterwards, and there is some help coming. But the trend here looks negative at this point, and it does seem like management has been behind that trend. Realistic models have to assume that the business is going to decline, even if external factors suggest the decline likely will be more gentle than the 16% erosion seen the last two years.That puts a lot of pressure on IT Deal Alert. A cursory look at the TTGT chart shows the market, at least, believes that business will be up to the challenge. At the moment, there's no reason to suggest otherwise. ITDA should drive the majority of revenue in 2018 after accounting for 45%+ in 2017. Growth actually accelerated in 2017, with revenue increasing 58% against 36% in 2016.Cotoia said in the Q4 shareholder letter that ""we believe that we are still in the early innings of a megatrend,"" in which customers increasingly focus on using data as part of the sales and marketing process. ITDA does have some competition, mostly from private companies like Madison Logic and Bombora, but recent results suggest the product is getting at the least its fair share of the growth in the category.Meanwhile, the company is having success moving toward longer-term contracts, which drove 24% of ITDA revenue, a figure that TechTarget aims to get above 30% going forward. The launch of Deal ScoreCard, a quarterly research report, aims to get the research side of the business on track. TechTarget has said in its 2015 shareholder letter that it saw an ""eight figure run rate within two years"" on that side of the business, but it appears (at least from a lack of commentary) that the company has fallen short.International growth presents another opportunity: overseas revenue increased 128% in 2017. Its share of segment revenue is less than 25% - against 38% in the Core business. Increasing penetration outside the U.S. offers yet another growth driver.With or without research, there's clearly reason for optimism toward ITDA, and in particular Priority Engine. But at the same time, this is a business now valued at $485 million - with that valuation supported by what looks like ~$65 million in 2018 revenue.After the run of late, TechTarget doesn't look particularly cheap. On a forward basis, using the midpoint of guidance, TTGT trades for 4x revenue. EV/EBITDA is about 16.7x. P/E is about 28.5x, based on my estimate of $0.60 based on guidance (the Street is at $0.54, though two of three analysts are at $0.59).Peer comparisons are tough. QuinStreet (QNST), which is more of a straight lead-gen model, now trades at 19x EBITDA guidance (fiscal year ending June) after more than tripling just since August. j2 Global (JCOM), which has a similar website ownership model (and which I've long thought would be a logical acquirer for TechTarget), trades at 9x. It also acquired Everyday Health for almost 10x.Using the QNST comp, a 20x EBITDA multiple doesn't seem outlandish (ITDA is a way better business, in my opinion), and that gets TTGT over $20. The midpoint of guidance suggests ~32% EBITDA growth and a 36% increase in non-GAAP EPS. Given that growth, from a 'feel' standpoint, high-20s P/E and high-teens EV/EBITDA aren't onerous, and in this market, those multiples can expand if the story is good enough.But there's also some help from what overall still was a modestly disappointing 2017 on a consolidated basis (again, revenue and EBITDA both came in below guidance given Q4 2016 results). The midpoint of 2018 guidance might suggest 32% EBITDA growth year over year; it also implies just 18% growth over three years. And to get there, TechTarget needs to meet that guidance for the first time since 2015.Longer term, there's still the issue of the Core segment, which is likely to account for 45% of 2018 growth. As impressive as ITDA is, core is going to be a drag. And the same ~50% incremental margins that are driving expected EBITDA growth this year mean that lower Core sales will be a bottom line drag, as well - with little ability to lower costs to match those lower revenue. (TechTarget can't cut spend on its sites; it needs those sites to get the data behind Deal Alert products.)By no means would I suggest a short of TTGT, and it's certainly possible that Deal Alert will be strong enough to drive upside - and/or that Core will stabilize in a better IT environment this year. But the market seems to be expecting a lot from TechTarget in 2018. And I'm not sure 2017 performance, or the business as a whole, is quite strong enough to support those expectations."
4097664,24594,2017-08-10T15:46:16-04:00,"TTGT's Q2 wasn't a blowout by any means, and both revenue and profits declined.But the strength in IT Deal Alert is more than enough to keep optimism going as the weakness in major legacy customers (hopefully) begins to reverse.The core bull case remains intact, and from that standpoint, $10 looks a bit too cheap.","At the risk of oversimplifying, there's a two-step bull case for TechTarget (TTGT):Obviously, that's a bit glib (and, as a TTGT shareholder, I'd point out buyers other than j2 are more than welcome). But TechTarget's size (enterprise value under $300 million, annual revenue guided to ~$110 million this year) makes a sale to a larger media company logical, at some point, and Deal Alert's current growth and margin potential suggest it could support the current valuation at a point in the not-too-distant future.The major concern and/or the reason that bull case is somewhat hidden is continuing weakness in the legacy business. That business - basically driving leads and selling ads on the company's 140+ IT-focused online media properties - has been hit by a weak IT market and, in particular, lower spend from TechTarget's largest customers. That split has existed for a few quarters and continued into the Q2 report on Wednesday.But management continues to insist that a rebound is on the way in the second half, and so far, I'm inclined to believe it. More importantly, even with TTGT near a two-year high after a 5%+ post-earnings bounce, TechTarget doesn't have to be right on that front for TTGT to make further gains.I wrote that TechTarget's Q1 was ""the best of times and the worst of times"", and that's just as true of Q2. Consolidated numbers don't look particularly strong: revenue declined 4%, and Adjusted EBITDA fell 26% year over year. But looking at the two businesses, there's reason for optimism and reason to believe the bull case here remains intact:IT Deal AlertThe IT Deal Alert product is a big driver of the bull case - and it looks pretty solid at the moment. Overall revenue growth did decelerate somewhat in Q2, dropping to 39% from 52% in Q1. But obviously, that's still a strong figure, and on the Q2 conference call, management guided for 40%+ in both Q3 and the full year.IT Deal Alert shows why TechTarget isn't just a media company that happens to focus on IT. The company's data is so precise, and its penetration into the industry is so deep that it can discover when specific departments in large organizations are considering major IT purchases simply from their activity. This ""purchase intent"" data quite obviously is hugely valuable - and has been able to grow the Deal Alert business from $4 million in 2013 to a guided ~$44 million this year.Q2 seems to suggest that the growth should continue. International revenue for the quarter was just $3.2 million - but that figure rose 138% year over year. CEO Mike Cotoia said on the Q2 call that the company is ""still not even out of the first inning"" in terms of overseas penetration. Considering that domestic revenue went from $4 million to ~$30 million between 2013 and 2017, it's not at all unlikely to predict that international sales will add another ~50 points of growth over the next 3-4 years, assuming a similar or even modestly slower ramp. That in turn positions TechTarget to hit a 3-5 year target of $80-120 million in sales. And, with incremental EBITDA margins over 50%, that move alone adds something like $25-30 million - more than double rough 2017 guidance of $22 million or so.Deal Alert is simply a huge part of the bull case here, and it's working. The company estimated that it would drive half of revenue by the end of 2018 and has insisted that its growth isn't coming at the expense of the 'core' business. And, (more on this later) as long as Deal Alert is growing, TTGT's downside looks reasonably protected, even at $10.CoreThe 'core' business - again, lead generation and content marketing through TechTarget websites - has struggled of late. Revenue declined 15% in 2016, with the declines accelerated as the year wore on. (TechTarget has also all but phased out a small events business, which generated about 4.5% of 2016 sales.)The story from management has been that a) the overall IT market is weak b) the strong dollar has been a further problem (leading to cost cuts, which include marketing) and c) major customers going through mergers (think Dell (DVMT) and EMC) and other restructuring activity have pulled back on spend. That story basically frames the business as facing as near- to mid-term trough, after which growth can resume.To be honest, I'm not 100% sold on that story, and there is a risk that spend here will simply stay at current, relatively depressed levels. But the Core business is getting better and is projected to improve further in the second half. Total core revenue did fall 20% year over year, but that's actually an improvement from Q1 (-25%) and Q4 (-24%).About 60% of the Q2 decline came from the top 10 customers, a proportion relatively similar to that seen in Q1. But it looks like that will get better. Cotoia said some of the large customers were moving through their integration issues, and projected improvement in the 2H, or at least in 2018. Comparisons start getting easier in Q3. TechTarget is guiding for revenue growth in Q3 (8.7% at the midpoint of guidance) and double-digit growth, excluding events. And, core revenue (I believe, based on commentary from CFO Gregory Strakosch on the Q2 call) is expected to increase sequentially in the second half and then year over year in 2018.Again, it's possible that management could be overly optimistic here, and the fact that non-large accounts still are seeing declines isn't exactly cause for celebration. My sense of the IT industry as a whole suggests there might be more going on than just a few large deals and a temporary bit of weakness. There is deflationary pressure across the space (notably in storage), and those large deals likely aren't going to stop.But at $10, I don't think TechTarget needs to hit its target in core (the same 3-5 year target of $80-120 million as seen in Deal Alert) to drive upside. Simply stabilizing the business and lapping the last of events next year suggests the potential for high-single-digit growth at least in 2019-2020, assuming Deal Alert only decelerates to 15%+. There's enough in the Q3 commentary to suggest that stabilization is on the horizon. That plus the strength in Deal Alert is more than enough to stay long here.TTGT does not look cheap at the moment. Adjusted EBITDA guidance suggests a 2017 multiple of about 13x and a P/E multiple in the high 20s.But it can get cheap, particularly with the 50%+ incremental margins. 2017 revenue should be in the $110 million range, split roughly $45 million Deal Alert and $65 million core. Give Deal Alert four years to double, and keep core flat, and 2021 numbers look like $155 million in revenue and ~$40-45 million in EBITDA. There's very little capex required here (~$4 million a year average the past three years), and assuming debt zeroes out, that's a business that can generate $20 million-plus in free cash flow. A high-single-digit EBITDA multiple and a high-teen FCF multiple both support a market cap of $400 million or so, about 40% higher than current levels and suggesting ~9% annual returns.To me, that looks like a conservative case, based on recent performance. I still think there's room for some growth in Core, particularly with the easy 1H 2018 comparisons and (hopefully) some level of normalization at the major customers. Bear in mind that Core isn't a standard online media business buffeted by some of the difficult recent trends like the shift to mobile and lower display ad CPC. 97% of traffic is unpaid, and it's the leads and the data that drive the real value, not the banner ads.Meanwhile, JCOM paid 10x for Everyday Health - and from here, IT Deal Alert would suggest a premium given its uniqueness and more limited competition in B2B. Any growth in core suggests an EBITDA level near $50 million toward the beginning of the next decade; and a low double-digit multiple suggests a double from current levels.Even if Core struggles, there's still a reasonable chance that Deal Alert can support something close to a current ~$280 million enterprise value. $80 million in revenue (up ~80% from current levels) at mid-30s EBITDA (below the long-term target for the business as a whole of 40%+) and a 10x multiple gets there. That's obviously an outcome where TTGT is obviously 'dead money', but it also leaves a bit of a ""heads I win, tails I don't lose much"" scenario relative to the legacy business.All told, coming out of Q2, the story remains intact. The near-term risk is that Q3 disappoints in Core; the mid-term risk is that Deal Alert stalls out for whatever reason. Given the potential upside here, both seem like risks well worth taking."
4225000,21815,2018-11-28T04:28:12-05:00,"The shares of TechTarget have been on a roller coaster ride.Some of it was caused by the shares getting a little ahead of themselves earlier, but there were are also some temporary headwinds and general market mayhem.Fundamentally, the business model is very strong, with some increasing returns built in.","TechTarget (TTGT) has been on a roll, but the shares have fallen back strongly since the summer. Should you buy? We think the shares offer a first chance for starting a position here.Here is a short description of what the company does (from FinViz):As SA Contributor Investing City argued, it's all about the data which creates network effects as vendors want to list where most eyeballs are and eyeballs go where most content is.The company did something clever with it. It started IT Deal Alert (ITDA) which uses the purchase intent data from IT buyers and charges IT vendors a monthly subscription for its use in order to target these buyers.That's a very clever idea, as it increases the earnings visibility (through a SaaS-based subscription model) and makes these recurring revenues, mostly through Priority Engine, which has been updated just last week. From that PR:From their September 2018 investor presentation:The company's segments are:But these are increasingly blending (Q3CC):So come 2019, the company will report two numbers:It's also important to stress that the goal is to achieve greater subscription rates, generating more recurring revenues, and the main driver of that is Priority Engine (from Q3CC):These long-term contracts are now 35% of revenue (up from just 23% a year ago), and while overall revenues grew only 10%, revenues from Priority Engine grew 38% y/y; it's actually growing twice as fast as IT Deal Alert, which grew 19% y/y. From the September 2018 investor presentation:The company has been growing steadily:But the share price has gone wild one way, and then the other:This isn't so surprising as there are increasing returns in the business model and EBITDA and earnings exploded, but the shares got a little ahead of themselves as the company ran into some slowing down and temporary problems (and difficult comps) in the second half of the year.From the Q3 Letter to shareholders:Management argued there was some cautiousness with their big accounts, stemming from three areas:The first should now have been resolved, but the second is still in full force as companies are unsure about the cost increases from tariffs, possible disruptions in their supply chains, and how much they can sell abroad.GDPR causes a bit of a temporary headwind. From the Q3CC:Not all of their customers take such a conservative approach (adding an additional opt-in) and it may not even be necessary. The company is also helping their customers (Q3CC):Management also stressed that their GDPR policies are the best in the business. This isn't just what they say themselves, but Forrester argues it's a competitive strength for the company. From the company's Q3 letter to shareholders:So the most likely outcome is that this is a short-term drag which will sort itself out when the implications of the data laws become more clear and best practices develop. In the meantime, they have a little more back-and-forth with customers, delaying some programs.While the impact will be short (Q4 and Q1 next year), it's both impacting revenues and cost. The latter stem from some of the telemarketing efforts to acquire the second opt-in (the company will outsource these efforts).From the Q3 investment letter:With the Priority Engine driving users to long-term subscriptions, gross margin has been climbing. With respect to operating margins:Operating cost increased by 9.5%, just under the 10% revenue growth but there was a substantial sequential decline. To see why, here are the Q2 figures from the Q2 10-Q:No mystery here; there was a sequential revenue decline and an almost $2M sequential operating cost increase in Q3. These are GAAP figures, exclusive of share-based compensation (which also increased, see below).Cash flow is growing and pretty solid for a company doing roughly $120M in revenues (past 12 months); a 17% free cash flow margin really isn't something to scoff at.More than 30% of the free cash flow is due to share-based compensation, but that hasn't led to much (if any) dilution (as the company buys these shares back, on average):At the end of Q3, the company had $32.4M in cash and investments and $24.8M of outstanding term loan debt. It paid down $2.5 million of debt during the quarter.The company is also embarking on a new $25M share buyback program.Analysts expect an EPS of $0.47 this year rising to $0.61 in 2019, which give the shares a forward multiple of 24.While we think the competitive position is pretty well cemented due to the specialist data trove and the network effects, nevertheless, there is one weakness in their business model, and it's one they're experiencing at the moment. It's quite cyclical. From the Q3CC:However, just as it can ratchet down quickly, it can also ratchet up quickly (Q3CC):So it cuts both ways here.There is much that we like in TechTarget:Against that we recognize that the company is susceptible to a sudden deceleration; it is actually in the midst of one at the moment. But we think these events are actually nice buying opportunities, and we're likely to issue a buying alert on SA Stocktalks and our website one of these days."
4132453,24594,2017-12-18T06:57:43-05:00,"TechTarget's 2017 remains split: hugely impressive performance in the newer IT Deal Alert segment and weakness in the legacy lead-gen business.Meanwhile, a 40% run just since late August has moved the valuation up to seemingly stretched levels.IT Deal Alert is an attractive story, 2018 guidance looks good, and there's reason to see years of growth ahead.But there's enough worry in the legacy business and in valuation to take profits, at least for now.","I've argued repeatedly this year that TechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT) would be a second-half story. The first half was marked by a notable split: the company's legacy lead-gen business, which it refers to as its Core segment, was struggling, while its relatively new IT Deal Alert business was booming. Management insisted that IT Deal Alert growth was real, and that the weakness in Core would abate as several major advertisers wrapped up significant M&A moves that had disrupted their spending.For the most part, the split results were good enough. Neither the Q1 nor Q2 reports really moved the stock other than some minor, short-lived volatility; TTGT ground out some gains and ended August below $10, up a respectable ~16% for the year. Coming out of Q2, though, it looked like Q3 would be critical, as I wrote at the time. If Core did rebound, as guided, in the second half, and if ITDA continued its progress, there was more upside coming. If not, a not-terribly cheap valuation and concerns about the legacy business raised a risk of a post-earnings sell-off.None of that actually played out. TTGT took off on its own just before Labor Day. Q3 earnings early last month were yet another mixed bag. IT Deal Alert posted a supremely impressive quarter; management proved overly optimistic toward the legacy business; net/net, results wound up smack-dab in the middle of guided ranges for the quarter. And the rally simply kept going:Source: finviz.comTruthfully, I have little idea as to what drove the gains, though as a TTGT shareholder, I hardly minded. But in their wake, I've taken the opportunity to exit my position. It's not an easy decision, and I'm mindful of the potential of IT Deal Alert, whose growth continues to impress and whose capabilities continue to improve. But valuation here is getting stretched, with the stock now at 14-15x initial 2018 EBITDA guidance, and ~half of next year's revenue still is coming from what looks like a potentially declining Core business.I argued when I purchased the stock back in April that the low end of management targets suggested a price around $14. But that was a 2-3 year target, and overall, the first three quarters of 2017 simply haven't changed the case quite enough to raise that target significantly. It's time to take the 50%+ gains since then - and root hard for a pullback.On a consolidated basis, the Q3 results look relatively uninteresting. TechTarget's guidance overall was spot-on: revenue of $28.0 million was dead in the center of a $27.5-28.5 million range, and Adjusted EBITDA of $6.1 million almost split guidance of $5.5-6.5 million.But the two halves of the business performed very differently. IT Deal Alert smashed expectations. Revenue grew 84%, a huge acceleration from 52% in Q1 and 39% in Q2. International revenue, a key growth opportunity, rose 150%, and now represents 19% of total ITDA sales. The number of customers rose 60%+, implying improved penetration and higher spend per customer.It's worth pointing out that Q3 did have an easier comparison: Q3 2016 growth was just 13%, by far the worst performance of last year. At the time, management cited weakness at four key customers as a headwind to growth; and so it should be considered good news that growth has rebounded both in Q3 and YTD.On the other hand, the Core business disappointed. Here, too, the comparison was easier, as revenue from those same four customers dropped 50% a year ago. Overall, core revenue fell 18% last year; it dropped another 14% in Q3 2017.Though guidance was a bit unclear on the Q2 conference call, that figure almost certainly is a disappointment, as TechTarget management had stressed second half improvement. Simply lapping last year's weakness was supposed to be a positive. Yet revenue declined quarter over quarter, which appears to contradict the optimistic outlook on that Q2 call, even accounting for minor impacts from seasonality.Overall, it looks like Core didn't rebound as strongly as management had projected. On the Q3 call, CEO Michael Cotoia tried to spin the results as an improvement, pointing out that declines had improved sequentially from -26% in Q1 to -23% in Q2 to -14% in Q3, with projections of ""single digits"" in Q4. But that improvement is coming in large part because the figures fell off sharply in the second half of last year, benefiting comparisons. Looking at two-year trends, Cotoia's argument seems a bit thin:And the problem given Q3 numbers and Q4 guidance is that the argument about key customers being the problem doesn't hold anymore. In the Q3 2016 shareholder letter, Cotoia cited a ~$1.5 million impact from the four major customers in Core ($2.5 million total, less $1 million from ITDA). That's roughly one quarter of the $6 million revenue erosion in the business over the last two years.The weakness in Core, then, isn't limited to one-time disruption. Nor does the weak dollar, which TechTarget has cited in the past as hurting its customers' overseas sales and leading to tightened marketing spend, appear to be a primary culprit. Rather, whether the broader catalysts are lower IT spending, lower online ad rates, or some combination of factors, the Core business now looks like it's potentially in long-term decline.Coming into this year, TechTarget's 3-5 year revenue target for the business is $80-120 million in revenue. But Core is heading for ~$58 million this year, down from $82 million in 2015. Essentially, management has been arguing that the business is going to rebound. The problem coming out of Q3 is that it's getting increasingly difficult to believe that will be the case.To be sure, I'm not exactly shocked that Core disappointed. And net/net, strength in ITDA is more important than weakness in Core. Deal Alert is on its way to generating over 50% of revenue next year, and 64% overall EBITDA flowthrough this quarter suggests it may be more profitable and/or that incremental margins are higher than in Core. (The latter is more likely given Deal Alert's relative newness, but that works too.)And Deal Alert looks like a winner. Growth has been impressive, with revenue moving from $4 million in 2013 to somewhere close to $50 million this year. Two partnerships with the platform's Priority Engine set the product up well going forward. TechTarget's publications reach so many IT professionals - and with 96% organic traffic - that it can actually tell if a department is looking to buy a certain product based on the browsing histories of those users.In May, it partnered with HG Data, which details which companies are using which products. That was followed by an agreement with DiscoverOrg, which compiles contact information on buying team contacts. And so, the value proposition of the Deal Alert Priority Engine becomes clear - and exceedingly attractive. Through TechTarget, the data can show who's looking to buy what. HG can tell the user what that client already has installed. And DiscoverOrg can detail the specific contact to reach. All of that data flows through salesforce.com or Marketo - providing a detailed, valuable lead source.On the Q3 call, management was asked whether there was still enough runway for the product, or whether there simply might not be that many leads to offer in certain verticals. Executive chairman Gregory Strakosch insisted that penetration rates were still low, and that many customers hadn't expanded Priority Engine to all of their business segments. If that's the case, IT Deal Alert has a long growth runway. The 58% revenue increase seen YTD may see some deceleration - but there's little reason to see it coming to an end anytime soon.The problem is that even projecting out the growth runway for Deal Alert, the challenges in Core and the valuation both make the current stock price look stretched. Net/net, 2017 has been positive for TechTarget; again, strength in Deal Alert is more important than weakness in Core, given the relative growth profiles in optimistic scenarios. But TTGT now has gained 60% YTD, with basically zero net financial leverage. At $9 and at $10, the split results between Core and ITDA were enough to stay long. At $14, that case just gets tougher and tougher to make.For 2018, TechTarget provided initial guidance of double-digit revenue growth and ""at least"" a 25% increase in Adjusted EBITDA. But even that figure suggests a 14x forward EV/EBITDA multiple. And it's worth pointing out that TechTarget has a history of being overly optimistic: initial guidance for 2016 was missed badly, and even 2017 has modestly underperformed. The company guided for at least 10% revenue growth, excluding its now-shuttered Events business, for instance; Q4 guidance suggests a ~6% full-year increase. Adjusted EBITDA should rise 17%, against projections for ""at least"" 20%.The numbers still can work - but it gets a bit tougher to make the case at these levels. Assuming Core stabilizes, and ITDA hits the high-end of its own $80-120 million target by 2020 (~34% CAGR), TechTarget would add ~$35 million in EBITDA, given previous guidance for ~50% incremental margins. That would mean EBITDA would more than double, to ~$65 million or so. A 12x multiple would imply something in the range of a double, or maybe a touch higher, assuming the company pays off its debt in the meantime.But there are a lot of aggressive assumptions in there. IT Deal Alert growth needs to be relatively torrid, even as tougher comparisons build. Core has to stabilize - and we've seen little evidence of that so far. It's not as if TechTarget can cut expenses in that space to match a declining revenue profile; it needs the user visits to drive purchase intent data used for ITDA, even if its monetization of that user data disappoints. A 12x multiple doesn't sound all that aggressive; but j2 Global (JCOM) paid less than 10x for Everyday Health, and receives a similar multiple on a consolidated basis at the moment. IT Deal Alert growth likely drives a premium to these comps (which admittedly aren't great, but are the best we can do); but the value of the Core business has to be considered as well. j2's struggles of late are a modest hindrance as well, since that was and remains the most logical acquirer.The story isn't over by any means - but it's hard to see much of an edge at this point. There's real risk here. I'm not confident in the Core business, particularly since it's now clear that there's more going on than just some short-term M&A-related noise. Management has been a little bit too optimistic of late. And if ITDA stalls out at all, this stock has significant downside. Next year's EBITDA is in the $28-30 million range; should that disappoint and come in closer to $25 million, a high-single-digit multiple (~1-turn discount to JCOM and to the EVDY buyout multiple) still suggests a 40%+ dip.All told, the run has just been too big, and it's priced in much of the potential inherent in IT Deal Alert. I'd love to see a pullback; back toward $11, the forward EV/EBITDA multiple gets back to a more attractive ~11x range. And at that level, the mixed results of 2017 still have the chance to drive more upside.At $14, that's just not the case anymore. Core needs to stabilize, and IT Deal Alert needs to keep performing. That's possible, and maybe even likely. I'm just not convinced it's worth the risks."
4073715,24594,2017-05-16T10:56:32-04:00,"TechTarget is a tale of two businesses at this point: IT Deal Alert is growing like gangbusters, and the legacy business is falling off a cliff.Management insists a second-half rebound is coming as IT spending and M&A both normalize, but it's hard not to be a bit skeptical.There's still enough to stay long out of Q1, but the stock is heading toward what looks like a volatile fall and winter.","Q1 was the best of times and the worst of times for TechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT). The company's growth driver, IT Deal Alert, had a banner quarter, with revenue increasing 52%. The legacy business, which supplies IT vendors with leads acquired through 140+ online publications, saw sales drop 25%. The market reacted to the split performance by essentially yawning:Source: Seeking AlphaEven though I'm long TTGT, the reaction seems about right. TechTarget was a second-half story heading into the quarter, and it remains one coming out. If legacy sales (referred to as 'Core' by the company) truly are being impacted by temporary IT weakness and M&A effects, as TechTarget argues, results should improve sharply in the second half and TTGT stock very likely will rise. If that's not the case, the bull case gets a bit tougher - even assuming IT Deal Alert has a strong year. I thought the risk/reward for that case was in favor of a long position before Q1, and I still think that's the case after the quarter. But with IT Deal Alert outperforming and Core underperforming, both risk and reward seem a bit higher than they did a month ago.Good News and Bad NewsThe directions of the two business segments in Q1 weren't surprising, though the magnitude of the moves was. IT Deal Alert had a simply stellar quarter. Revenue growth of 52% year over year fits nicely with a target of a 40%+ sales increase for the full year. The number of spenders rose 62%, creating a larger base of potential 'land and expand' opportunities down the line, and an international launch went well.TechTarget also announced an interesting partnership with HG Data. HG tracks information on what products are installed by which companies. That adds another layer to IT Deal Alert's capabilities in its Priority Engine software. The point of Priority Engine is that it can tell which departments at which companies are in the near-term market for IT products and services, based on their use of TechTarget online properties. The addition of HG means that Deal Alert customers can also know what type of product already is installed at those high-quality leads.The performance in Deal Alert is especially comforting because 2017 guidance of 40%+ year-over-year growth implied an acceleration from 2016 levels and thus looked potentially aggressive. The year isn't over, obviously, but TechTarget seems on a path to hit that target. And, with Deal Alert very quickly becoming a major part of the business, it generated 44% of online revenue in Q1 2017, against just 28% the year before, continued growth bodes well for long-term performance, particularly given strong incremental EBITDA margins in the business as a whole.Of course, part of the reason that Deal Alert grew to 44% of online revenue (which is basically the whole business at this point, as an events business has been almost completely phased out) is that Core revenue fell sharply. A 25% decline included a discomfiting 28% drop in North American sales for the second straight quarter.To TechTarget management, the weakness is largely temporary. Over half of the Q1 decline came from the company's top 10 customers. Four of those are going through major mergers (one is the Dell Technologies (DVMT) - EMC tie-up), which historically has depressed marketing spend as they play out. Those customers should start to come back in the second half - and comparisons start getting easier in Q2 and progressively so in Q3 and Q4. Meanwhile, IT spend is weak and getting weaker, as currency effects plague multinational producers and cloud adoption impacts hardware manufacturers.The extent to which management is right probably informs TechTarget's trading over the next 12 months. 3-5 year targets of $80-120 million in revenue in each business already look aggressive, with Core TTM sales at $66 million and full-year guidance implying ~$63 million or so in 2017 revenue. If Core can just get somewhere close to stable, IT Deal Alert can drive overall revenue growth, and with ~50% incremental margins, a TTM 14x EV/EBITDA multiple will come down quickly. (TechTarget guidance implies a sub-11x multiple to 2017 EBITDA - assuming that guidance is correct.)The Q1 results seem to raise the risk that Core either won't stabilize soon or will have a weaker long-term trend than management might believe at the moment. Q2 guidance - consolidated revenue down 10% and Adjusted EBITDA down 34% at the midpoint - implies the stabilization isn't coming in the June quarter. That puts a lot of pressure on Q3 and Q4 and makes it likely that TTGT has some big moves in store off back-half earnings.Staying LongFor now, the strength in Deal Alert offsets the weakness in Core. Deal Alert doesn't quite support the current $250 million enterprise value, but down the line, assuming it can get to $100 million at the company's historical 20%+ margin, it could come close. As long as that business stays on track, there's going to be some level of downside protection in TTGT. And, it does appear that the business is both performing well and has an intriguing growth opportunity in front of it, with TechTarget still expanding and fine-tuning the suite of products (including Priority Engine and data services). Even if Core can get toward stable and minimal declines, the overall enterprise will grow: assuming a ~50/50 split in 2018, double-digit growth in Deal Alert and single-digit declines in Core still imply mid-single-digit consolidated growth, and incremental margins from there get EBITDA growing double digits and FCF at 15%+. At low double-digit EV/EBITDA and ~20x normalized FCF even assuming a modest 2017 miss, that's probably enough.The long-term case may be small comfort if the back-half disappoints, and I wouldn't blame investors not long the stock for taking a ""wait and see"" attitude at least through Q2. But at $9, I still think TechTarget doesn't need that much to support the current valuation - some improvement in Core and continuation in Deal Alert - and has upside to $15+ if management is right about the future, or close. For now, that's good enough risk/reward. But, again, come Q3, both the risk and the reward seem likely to be elevated."

The key driver has been the company's IT Deal Alert ""purchase intent"" offering, backed by confidence toward IT spending more broadly.The optimism makes some sense: indeed, ITDA was the key reason I bought TTGT shares a little over a year ago. But the gains seemed to outpace the company's results. I, in fact, sold my shares back in December at $14, seeing a strong run nearing an end.Even after a strong Q1 report (pdf), the valuation here looks awfully stretched. Growth is impressive, but this remains a stock valued at 26x EV/EBITDA and 6.5x EV/revenue - even at the high end of updated 2018 guidance. And the irony at this point is that it looks like it's going to be the legacy lead-gen business - what TechTarget calls its ""Core"" segment - that is going to have to support the valuation if TTGT is going to show any more upside.IT Deal Alert is based on the immense amount of data that TechTarget generates. TTGT operates over 140 websites, including Bitpipe, ComputerWeekly, a number of review sites, and other niche-focused offerings on techtarget.com itself. Those sites, in total, have nearly 20 million users.So deep is the user base that TechTarget has data from specific buying teams at companies around the world. And at this point, it actually can discover, through that data, which buyers are looking for which products at which times. That's obviously hugely valuable information. TechTarget delivers the data in a form which can be integrated into CRMs like Salesforce.com, and partnerships with smaller firms HG Data and DiscoverOrg augment the proprietary data.It's a product that's obviously attractive on its face, and its growth has been spectacular:Source: TechTarget May presentationIndeed, the performance appears to have outpaced even management's expectations. Just a year ago, the company had a 3-5 year revenue target for ITDA of $80-120 million. That's been bumped up to $120-140 million, per the above-linked presentation.Nothing in Q1 seems to do anything to change the outlook here. Revenue in the segment grew 31% year over year in the quarter. Priority Engine (a subscription-based part of the ITDA offering) sales doubled, as TechTarget continues to move toward more recurring revenue (with a target of 40%, against sub-20% a year ago). International revenue rose 64%. The overseas opportunity here looks to be a significant mid-term driver, with that revenue still roughly a quarter of TTM revenue against ~40% in the Core business. Customer count rose to 600-plus against 450+ a year ago, and there still seems to be plenty of room for improvement on that front, both domestically and internationally.All that said, I'm not sure the outlook for ITDA really has changed that much over the past twelve months - or even so far this year, during which time TTGT has doubled. The 31% growth in Q1 was a deceleration from a 58% rate in both Q4 and full-year 2017. CEO Mike Cotoia said on the Q1 conference call that the growth rate in ITDA was ""in line with what we had expected"". That's good news, but whether it's enough to support 30% just since the earnings report on May 9 seems a bit questionable.Again, ITDA is an extremely attractive product and a huge opportunity for TechTarget. It's almost certainly going to drive over half of total revenue this year, a proportion that should only increase going forward. TechTarget management seemed more optimistic toward IT spending on the Q1 call, which should help demand. Cotoia pointed out in the Q&A of the call that the GDPR could present a tailwind for TechTarget, since its base data is fully owned, and fully opt-in. The CEO said the regulation was a ""short-term negative"", but longer-term ""a big competitive advantage for us"".The question is at this point whether even torrid success for ITDA already is priced in. And both the price of the stock at the moment and the nature of TechTarget's business mean that the Core segment is going to have to do its part as well.The news for the Core business seems a lot better in Q1, with a 5% y/y increase. On the heels of two tough years - a 16% decline in 2017 and a 15% drop the year before - the growth seems like a step in the right direction. That's doubly true after a -3% print (including growth in North America) in Q4.Per the call, a big part of the improvement is coming from the fact that the 10 largest customers are getting back to normal after a number of M&A deals and restructurings. The headwind from a strong dollar has moderated as well. Cotoia said the 5% growth in the quarter was ""primarily attributed to the global IT vendors"". And he raised the possibility of upside to guidance if IT spending accelerated in the second half, while admitting ""it's not a 'light switch' as of right now"".Meanwhile, there's also been a ""halo effect"" on Core, with customers beginning to switch back and forth between the two categories - and even now moving to subscription programs.Certainly, the news is better. But a bit of caution is required for several reasons. First, it's one quarter, and the comparisons are rather easy. TechTarget has generally framed the weakness in the Core business as being due to the choppiness from larger companies. But revenue in core still dropped 27% over four years, including a 29% decline in North America. That provides an obviously low bar to clear in terms of Q1 growth, and the 5 point boost ""primarily"" from larger customers also shows that there's more going on here than just customer M&A and cost-cutting.Secondly, TechTarget has been overly optimistic toward Core in the past. 2016 consolidated guidance missed badly, and the company actually modestly underperformed initial projections last year as well. Given the strength in ITDA, it's Core that's been the cause. And, third, the company actually has pulled down its expectations already, with the 3-5 year target range dropping to $75-100 million from a previous $80-120 million.Even that new range seems somewhat optimistic, suggesting a minimum 5% CAGR over five years from last year's $59 million to the $75 million low end. But increasingly, it looks like the Core business is going to have to hit those targets. TechTarget's bull case is based at least part on its attractive incremental margins, cited at 50-60% on an EBITDA basis. A lack of growth in Core undercuts those margins.And unlike other two-segment businesses, TechTarget can't cut costs to boost margins in the lower-growth segment. The content being monetized in Core is the same content creating the purchase intent data. And at the end of the day, that Core business still seems to have problems beyond the short-term hiccups among a few customers. The long-term trend remains negative. But at this valuation, that's going to have to change.Source: TechTarget May presentationTaking the high end of the company's targets, revenue would reach $240 million. At a 40% EBITDA margin, EBITDA would near $100 million. Assuming cash flow is kept on the books, a 15x multiple likely leads to a market cap of around $1.5 billion and a $50 share price. That's a 15% annualized return if TTGT can get there in four years, and suggests current fair value around $37 at an 8% discount rate. A low-capex model admittedly helps the case here: in this model, TTGT is valued at a low 20s P/FCF, which is more reasonable than a 15x EBITDA multiple might sound.But that's a scenario where an awful lot goes right. ITDA grows revenue 25% a year. That's perhaps not unrealistic; what seems like a bigger stretch would be a 14% CAGR for Core sales. And it's worth noting that if Core stalls out, the model starts to fall apart. With zero Core growth, $200 million in 2021 revenue probably gets EBITDA closer to $75 million, as the 50%+ incremental margins on Core aren't realized. Free cash flow is ~$50 million (maybe a touch higher); low 20s P/FCF and mid-teens EBITDA suggest an enterprise value of $1.1 billion or so, a market cap of $1.2 billion, and a share price around $40.That's about a 9% annualized return. And it's a scenario where ITDA still basically realizes its immense potential; in fact, it hits the high end of projections a year sooner than projected.It's possible that ITDA could outperform. TTGT could still merit a high-teens EBITDA/mid-20s free cash flow multiple next decade, as high as that seems, particularly with Core dipping below 30% of consolidated revenue. But it seems a huge stretch to see any alpha here without Core truly being back on track from a multi-year perspective. Again, there don't appear to be material cost savings that can be taken if Core disappoints without impacting ITDA.Again, ITDA is a hugely attractive product. But at 26x EBITDA, ~40x earnings, and 6x+ revenue, anything less than expectation-smashing performance isn't enough to move TTGT materially higher on its own. The Core business has to contribute as well. And while 2018 may be a rebound year on that front, Core actually has to get to new highs. Barring a huge shift in IT spending growth rates, I'm not sure how that happens. And if that doesn't happen, I'm skeptical there's much, if any, upside left in TTGT shares."
4061508,24594,2017-04-11T13:46:46-04:00,"TechTarget seems like an odd story: a hyper-focused online media company that's projecting rather sharp growth.But the story actually seems rather reasonable, and the new IT Deal Alert product looks like a catalyst.The low end of management targets suggests current fair value of $14, or 50% upside. That leaves a lot of room for error in the current valuation.","TechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT) is one of the more interesting, and least followed, plays in tech. TechTarget operates over 140 websites, each of which focuses on a particular IT niche. It seems like it would be an awful business at the moment, given pressures on online media from ad blocking and the shift to mobile. Nor does it seem like TechTarget properties like BrianMadden.com or online library BitPipe would have much of a moat, or much potential for non-advertising monetization.That's not the case, however. TechTarget's reach and specialization are such that it can provide highly qualified leads to technology vendors. In fact, TechTarget's penetration into IT has led to a new product, IT Deal Alert, which management expects to be a growth catalyst going forward. TechTarget gets enough visits from IT departments that it can actually tell when a specific company is looking to make a purchase - and what they're looking to buy. That is hugely valuable information for vendors - and a key differentiator for TechTarget.The story isn't perfect: growth has been choppy, particularly of late, and valuation doesn't look compelling on its face. But I do think TechTarget has carved out an interesting niche, and even the low end of management targets suggests current fair value around $14. At $9, I'm happy to bet that management is right - or close.Revenue Growth OpportunitiesThe primary catalyst for TTGT is the company's relatively new ""IT Deal Alert"" product:Source: TechTarget March presentationAgain, TechTarget can suss out major products simply through content patterns from various IP departments. That creates extremely valuable leads, which TTGT sells in about 80 specific segments, per the 10-K. TechTarget also uses the data for a subscription service which can be integrated into the salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Marketo (NASDAQ:MKTO) platforms, and as the basis for quarterly and annual research reports.Deal Alert has been a pretty solid success so far, with revenue increasing from $4 million in 2013 to $31 million in 2016. After 36% growth in 2016, management guided for an acceleration to ""at least 40%"" this year in the Q4 release [pdf]. There's still opportunity for penetration overseas, where revenue was under $6 million in 2016, per the 10-K, even after growing 50% in each of the last two years. With guidance suggesting that IT Deal Alert will represent roughly 40% of 2017 revenue, TechTarget's overall sales growth should improve going forward.The other growth opportunity is expanding the 'core' business overseas. International growth did stall out in 2016, with revenue down 5% overall and 11% ex-Deal Alert, per the 10-K. But ex-US sales have improved from ~5% of total revenue in 2009 to 31% last year. Some of that growth has come from acquisitions (primarily in Western Europe), but TTGT still has whitespace to further drive penetration outside the U.S.Overall, there should be an opportunity here. Half of 2016 revenue - IT Deal Alert and international 'core,' as the company calls it - seems like it should have a growth runway in front of it. Continuing questions about direct online marketing - whether the problems with Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube, 'click fraud,' and continuing ROI concerns - should make TechTarget's products more valuable. The IT market as a whole has been weak of late, which has hurt TechTarget, particularly in the legacy lead generation business. But there's still room for revenue growth, and high incremental EBITDA margins (40%+, per management) will add leverage as sales grow.How This Goes WrongThe biggest risk to TechTarget is that the legacy business will erode in a way that offsets much, if not all, of the opportunities in IT Deal Alert, in particular. That business has struggled, admittedly. North America core online revenue was ~flat in 2014, fell 2% in 2015, and then dropped 16% in 2016.Management has blamed the 2016 weakness on four key customers going through major transactions, which disrupted marketing spend. Per the 10-K, online revenue from those customers declined $5.6 million - which would account for nearly half of the YOY decline in worldwide core online (i.e., non-Deal Alert) sales last year. That was a 42% decline, which accelerated to 50% in Q4, per the Q4 release. General weakness in IT spend overall certainly contributed as well.The concern has to be that there's further weakness ahead in core, particularly in North America after three consecutive years of declines, with a fourth guided in 2017. TechTarget management on the Q4 call said it expected an improvement in large accounts in the second half of 2017. As such, it expects further declines in 1H, with growth in the back half not quite enough to offset those losses on a full-year basis. Post-2017, however, TechTarget still is projecting growth, with a 3-5 year target of $80 to $120 million in revenue from core, up from a guided ~$67 million in 2017. If TTGT management is wrong on that front, that puts a significant damper on the bull case for the stock.For now, I'm willing to give TechTarget the benefit of the doubt. For one, it does look like ad spend weakness is a market-wide problem. QuinStreet (NASDAQ:QNST) highlighted B2B tech weakness in citing a 7% decline in 2016 sales (p.33 of its 10-K) to its ""other client verticals,"" with the discussion implying a likely double-digit decline in tech. j2 Global (NASDAQ:JCOM) attributed most of the growth (p.52 of its 10-K) in its Digital Media segment to acquisitions. Privately held competitor Madison Logic does appear to be growing quickly, and recently sold out to private equity, but hard numbers there are limited. And that aside it's hard to argue that TechTarget is seeing market share erosion. The overall themes of disruption from M&A and general weakness, meanwhile, have been echoed by commentary from IT distributors and other members of the value chain.Still, it's likely worth keeping some skepticism at this point. Adjusted EBITDA guidance of ~$23 million or so for 2017 represents a sub-3% CAGR over five years. Guided online revenue of ~$112 million puts revenue just 6% above 2013 levels, though the divestiture of the declining events business has added some top-line pressure. There are some margin concerns as well: Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26% back in 2008, but is guided to just over 20% in 2017. Overall, there's a ""well, where's the growth been so far?"" type of question for TTGT, which still is down ~25% from early 2015 peaks.But at the moment, there's enough to see both revenue and profits expanding going forward. There should be some normalization in IT spend. TechTarget's niche and moat seem reasonably solid. And the valuation remains at a level where TechTarget doesn't have to perform to targets to support current fair value. And if it does, there's a lot of upside ahead.ValuationSource: TechTarget March presentationThe bull case for TTGT is reasonably simple. Core starts to rebound in the second half of 2017, and driven by international penetration, growth resumes in 2018 and beyond. (A weaker dollar would help on this front: currency hurts not only on a translation basis, but because it hurts IT vendor profits, which in turn leads to cost-cutting on overseas spend.) IT Deal Alert continues to grow, albeit at a more moderate rate. 50-60% incremental margins drive substantial overall margin expansion and leverage. And TechTarget (at least from my standpoint) should look for a sale, with JCOM the most likely acquirer. j2 paid ~10x EBITDA for Everyday Health, which has a very similar model to that of TechTarget.And it doesn't take a home run relative to these targets to drive upside from $9. Assuming it takes five years to get to the low end of revenue targets in both Core and Deal Alert, at 50% incremental margin (it too the low end of management projections), 2022 EBITDA would be ~$47 million. (2017 guidance implies ~$45 million in Deal Alert revenue and ~$67 million in Core.) That's a 12% CAGR in Deal Alert sales and sub-4% in Core.At 10x EBITDA plus what should be at least $30 million in net cash (up from $1 million-plus in current net debt), TTGT is worth $500 million. Cash flow figures support a similar valuation, with normalized FCF in this scenario probably close to $30 million, and synergies likely enough to make that an acquirer's cash flow multiple somewhere in the 15x range.Assuming a 2% annual increase in share count (TechTarget does have a buyback authorization with $12 million left on it, enough to repurchase ~5% of the float), TTGT is worth $16. Discounted back at 8%, current fair value is $11; at 10%, TTGT still is worth just under $10, about 10% above current levels. That's a nice gain in a scenario that management likely would consider disappointing, and one that doesn't assume any major inflection in the business, just reasonable success in Deal Alert and modestly healthier IT vendors. Meanwhile, something closer to the middle of management targets could get TTGT toward $25 in four years, suggesting a value of $15-16 discounted back.This isn't quite a ""heads I win, tails I don't lose"" scenario, but it does seem like the market is pricing in a continuation of recent trends, and not fully appreciating the value of Deal Alert, in particular. TechTarget management argued on the Q4 call that an extensive customer review didn't show cannibalization of core spend by Deal Alert products, a major concern. It doesn't look like advertisers are leaving TechTarget for alternatives; rather, short-term disruption and a cyclical low in some key areas of IT have hurt demand. That demand should normalize, benefiting core revenue as well.Overall, it does seem like upside far outweighs downside at current levels. TechTarget as a company doesn't have to be perfect to drive TTGT into the double-digits. Between Deal Alert and a second-half rebound in core, there should be enough to get TTGT past $10 - at least - this year, and further growth in 2018 and beyond.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

The numbers for 3Q were impressive across the board, with online revenues up 29% y/y, EBITDA up 88% and its 2014 full year forecast was upped.Its gross profit margin was 74% in 3Q, up from 70% in 3Q13. And net income was up $0.9mm in 3Q and up from $0.6mm in 3Q13. It still carries no debt and some $40mm in cash. Shares are up almost 10% for the last week and up 100% for the last year.We covered TTGT last year, noting that the company had growth potential in international markets and the balance sheet to make tuck-in acquisitions. Faster growing international markets could make up as much as 35% of total revenues. On the acquisition front, the company targets sites that have strong traffic and good content, just under-monetized. However, shares are now trading close to our $11 price target.Expected to grow EPS at an expected CAGR that's 66% higher than the industry, there's still value in TTGT. This despite shares trading at 3.6x sales and 2.1x book value. Its EV/sales of 3.4x multiple is still below our justified multiple and sales are expected to grow over 15% y/y in 2015. With that, we see $14 upside -- 35% higher than current levels."
3529806,78265,2015-09-24T17:23:40-04:00,"There are certainly things we like about TechTarget. The company has no debt and helps IT vendors target IT professionals who are researching a specific topic. Very compelling.The problem is that one and only thing all investors are interested in is operating profits. ""Cool"" narratives are great, but if profits aren't sufficient, what's the point?In addition, optimistic shareholders have bid this stock up to prices that don't make sense to us in light of everything going on with profits. Avoid until prices drop.","There's much that we like about TechTarget Inc. (NASDAQ:TTGT). It's a company that owns 150 websites and is focused on selling to the enterprise IT professional. Each of the websites focuses on a different aspect of technology and the company specializes in offering vendors targeted access to corporate IT decision makers who are actively researching specific items on one of the company's websites. It's a very compelling sounding narrative and a great idea. We also like the very low level of risk in the capital structure. The company is debt free. The problem is that the negatives of poor profitability and optimistically priced shares outweigh the low debt and compelling sounding narrative here.Operating ProfitsThe source of all shareholder wealth is profits. Operating profits are what provides dividends and growing book value in the form of retained earnings. For that reason, we spend a great deal of time focused on them. It doesn't matter much if a company has a compelling sounding strategy as they do in this case or whether they are in transition or anything else. What matters, ultimately, is not the narrative, but the level of operating profits. When we analyze such a business, we compare the level of operating profits the company makes relative to the amount of capital employed to generate those returns. We want the resulting yield calculation (profits over capital) to be as high as possible. In the case of companies like TechTarget, we're looking for a yield in the neighborhood of 5% greater than the risk free rate. This reflects the relatively low level of business risk here (the company seems to do a good job of selling valuable information to its customers and seems to have a moderately sized ""moat""). Given that the risk free rate is approximately 2.3% at the moment, we're looking for a yield of about 7.5% out of TechTarget. Unfortunately, the company only generates about 4.4% on the capital employed.Source: Company filingsIt's true that this is a backward looking analysis and the future of the company will be much different than the recent past. That's true, but it largely misses the point. The point of exercises like these is to perform a gap analysis between where the company is and where we would need it to be to be considered a worthwhile investment. Holding all else constant, we'd need operating profits to jump about 71% from where they are now to where we would need them to be (~$10.12 million). By performing a backward looking analysis, we are in a good position to apply some mathematical rigor to our analyses.Market ExpectationsFor better or worse, investing involves more than simply finding a profitable company and buying in. We access the future cash flows of a company by buying shares. The difficulty is that the up and down share price reflects more about the short-term mood of the crowd than it does anything fundamental in the underlying business. How much can a business really change over a trading day?When we reflect on the shares, we specifically need to avoid optimistic forecasts about the future of a company. We need to do this because optimistic forecasts represent the worst of all possible worlds from an investors' point of view. If the forecasts embedded within an optimistic forecast are met, the shares may not move much as the good news has already been ""baked in."" If, as is more likely, some combination of higher taxes, competition, slowing IT spending, etc., conspire to dash expectations, the shares may move dramatically lower. That's why we want to avoid optimistic forecasts.One of the ways we use to judge the level of optimism at the moment is to compare the current and the forward PE multiple on a stock. If the forward multiple is too low, relative to the current PE, that's a sign that expectations may be too optimistic. At the moment, TechTarget sports a PE of 56.7 and a forward PE of 16.7. Holding all else constant, then, the market is forecasting a growth rate in earnings of about 240%. We consider this to be a very optimistic forecast, especially in light of the modest earnings growth the company has shownSource: GurufocusConclusionWe believe that investors win by not losing. TechTarget has a very compelling sounding narrative, but we can't advocate buying shares until both operating profits improve and the level of optimism baked into the share price has come down. The company grows its net income at approximately the rate of economic growth, but the shares are being priced for supernormal growth. We don't believe that forecast is warranted and for that reason we advocate avoiding the shares until pessimism takes over and/or profits improve."
2295455,35401,2014-07-01T14:17:38-04:00,"I think TechTarget has the capacity to blow away analyst revenue and EBITDA estimates.
        Revenue growth combined with a very fixed cost base = rapid EBITDA margin expansion.
        Putting a reasonable multiple on 2016 EBITDA suggests a $24 price target.","Please see my earlier article for background on TTGT's business.TechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT) has had a busy couple of months. First came Q1 numbers well ahead of expectations and increased guidance for 2014, which drove a 20% increase in stock price. Then came the announcement of a secondary by selling shareholders which drove the stock price back down to where it had been before the Q1 earnings report. The secondary was completed successfully and the stock popped by 20% again over the next two weeks.If that was not enough excitement, a short seller came out with a negative report on TTGT based on Google's new search algorithm which sends less traffic to TTGT's website. The stock quickly dropped 15% on that report, but recovered fully after the company responded with a well thought out press release rebutting the short seller's argument. Finally this morning, Needham and Jefferies initiated coverage on TechTarget with Buy ratings and $11 and $12 price targets respectively.When looking at the analyst reports, I was struck by what seemed to be very conservative numbers for revenue and EBITDA for 2014 and 2015. Numbers for 2014 were in line with recent management guidance at 14% revenue growth and 80% EBITDA growth, but I think based on our own models that TTGT could end up with 20% revenue growth this year and over 100% EBITDA growth. Given the explosive growth of IT Deal Alert, TechTarget's new product, I think revenue could grow again by 20% in 2015 and 2016 and EBITDA margins could expand to 28% in 2015 and 34% in 2016. While these numbers are up significantly from 2014, they are below management's ultimate 40% EBITDA margin target. A 15x EBITDA margin seems appropriate given TTGT's revenue growth and potential for additional margin expansion, and applying that multiple to our estimate of $51m in 2016 EBITDA (plus the cash), that gets you to a $24 price target.The main risk to the story would be a meaningful decline in IT spending for enterprises, which would blunt TechTarget's core business of selling leads to IT vendors. Gartner is currently predicting a 2% rise in IT spending this year which would be fine for TTGT as its core business would be supported giving its international business and IT Deal Alert room to run.There is also the possibility of an acquisition of the company somewhere down the road as it has unique and actionable data than cannot be found elsewhere. A large data company like Thomson Reuters or Bloomberg could find its buyer intent data interesting as a complement to what they already have. I do not think management and large shareholders are looking to sell at these price levels given the potential upside in the story but at some later point this could be an endgame for the company.Disclosure: The author is long TTGT.

The company introduced a product called IT Deal Alert two years ago and this product has grown rapidly to date and is expected to grow 50% next year. This product currently comprises about 20% of TechTarget's overall revenue. IT Deal Alert is a product that mines user data on TTGT's 150 websites to figure out which companies are looking to make an imminent IT purchase decision. TechTarget then asks those companies if they are actually looking to make such a purchase and if so, for how much, which vendors are they looking at, who are their incumbent vendors, etc. The company then takes all of this information and sells it on a subscription basis to its IT vendor customers.TechTarget has just released another new product with great potential. This product is based on the post-sale surveys TTGT has been doing for years. These surveys gather information such as which IT vendor won the deal, who was short-listed, and what was the pricing on the deal. With this data, TechTarget can determine near-real time market shares amongst the IT vendors and valuable pricing data as well. This data is important for the IT vendors so they can gauge themselves against their competitors, but it is also valuable for mutual funds and hedge funds so they can see which vendors are winning in the marketplace. This product was just launched this quarter and has the potential to drive revenue over the next few years.TechTarget has a highly fixed cost business model where it pays its salaries for its editors and sales force and pays to keep its websites running. Incremental revenue drops fairly unimpeded to the EBITDA line. That is why the company's double-digit revenue growth forecast next year will cause 25% growth in EBITDA. The company feels that a few years out its EBITDA margin can reach 40% from the low 20% range currently.Tax-loss selling has knocked down TTGT's shares to much lower levels than last year, even though its business has made significant progress. You are currently paying 7.5x EBITDA on 2016 numbers for a company that will grow EBITDA by 25% next year. This seems like a significant distortion of true value. We think that 15x EBITDA is a more reasonable multiple for this kind of growth, resulting in a $14.80 stock price for an 87% return. The company seems to agree that its stock is undervalued as it is currently in the midst of a meaningful stock buyback."
3234216,35401,2015-06-04T07:15:00-04:00,"TechTarget (TTGT) is segmenting its new product, IT Deal Alert, to maximize its addressable market.
        A mostly fixed cost structure means that incremental revenue drops to the bottom line.
        Adjusted EBITDA is poised to grow rapidly as revenue grows.","TechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT) is a name in which I have summarized the basic business in previous articles. From a numbers perspective, the stock is appealing. It trades at 8.5x 2016E EBITDA with EBITDA growing at a 24% clip in each of 2015 and 2016. There is plenty of headroom in the business model because the company's costs are basically fixed. As such, the company (and we) feel that it can get to a 40% EBITDA margin over time versus 20% in 2014. IT Deal Alert (described below) is 20% of the overall business and is growing at a 50% annual pace. We feel this can drive 15%+ overall top line growth for the foreseeable future. The stock is down significantly recently because their Q1 numbers missed and they lowered guidance for the year. This was due to marketing cuts at their big customers who were faced with revenue shortfalls due to the recent currency headwinds. Even given the lowered guidance, EBITDA will still grow by 24% versus 2014.What does TechTarget do? In a nutshell, it is an internet company that has 150 different websites focused on the enterprise IT professional. Each website focuses on a slightly different aspect of technology and has content written by the company's 150 editors as well as datasheets and white papers written by IT vendors. The goal of the sites is to educate IT professionals as well as give them a place to do research when they are looking to make an IT purchase.The company's core business model is to sell leads to its IT vendor customers (think Cisco, HP, IBM, etc.). TTGT has 14 million registered users who frequents its sites and when one of its registered users clicks on a datasheet or whitepaper or podcast supplied by an IT vendor, the company sells that lead to that vendor.By analyzing the patterns of user traffic over the years, TTGT found that it was able to predict with high accuracy when an enterprise IT firm was looking to make an imminent purchase of IT equipment. It then took this information and actually confirmed if it was true with the enterprise IT firm, and gathered more data from them such as the size of the purchase, the incumbent vendors, and who was currently lined up as the top candidates.It took all of this information and started selling it on a subscription basis to the IT vendors as a product called IT Deal Alert. This basic product has gone from no revenue two years ago to 20% of TTGT's business today. As time has gone by and TechTarget has gathered feedback from its customers, it has begun to segment the basic product so as to maximize its potential with each type of buyer at its end customer.Qualified Sales Opportunities is the IT Deal Alert product focused on customers' direct salesforces which need actionable leads with as much information as possible. Qualified Sales Opportunities for the Channel is a version of this product directed at IT vendor channel partners.Priority Engine is made for inside sales and marketing teams and is integrated with Salesforce.com to help customers prioritize their sales leads. Deal Data is for data scientists at large customers and is a direct upload of all of TTGT's raw purchase intent data.On its last conference call TechTarget announced a new product that will be rolling out in the fall. This product will use TTGT's post-deal data to give very rapid and accurate reads of market share and pricing data and this information will be sold to both IT vendors and also the investment community.IT Deal Alert overall in all of its forms is still a nascent offering from TechTarget and has a lot of room to run. This revenue ramp will result in increasing EBITDA and EPS at the company and this in turn will drive the share price. We feel that 15x EBITDA is a fair multiple for the company given its growth rate and as such, our price target is $15.25 (67% upside) on 2016 numbers and $17.80 (94% upside) on 2017 numbers."
3907236,56112,2016-02-19T12:14:36-05:00,"TechTarget is little-known among the investment community, but well-known among its target audience.Amidst the ongoing havoc wreaked by Google algorithm changes over the past four years, TechTarget has flourished, as its high-quality content is valuable to technology buyers.Growth in core US online revenues appears to have slowed dramatically, but there are many opportunities for new product introduction (and international expansion).With high incremental margins, there's a lot of room for upside here - it's not hard to model out a scenario where the stock doubles or triples over 3-5 years.I'm still doing due diligence, but TechTarget is one of the better names I've worked on.","TechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT) has been punished for a little while despite results that aren't all that bad. The company operates in a unique niche - it provides high-quality content to corporate technology buyers, thereby creating leads for a broad base of major technology companies.Its small size and the lack of any true public market comparables makes it underfollowed, although it's actually received some good coverage over the past few years by ""Cobiaman"" here on Seeking Alpha (which you should go read). I'm going to try my best to level-set for readers who aren't too familiar with the story, but relative to most small caps, TechTarget actually does a very good job providing clear and understandable shareholder-facing information.This is the sort of stock that requires patience and a long-term orientation, but if you're willing to hold on for an extended period of time, I think there are meaningful value creation opportunities over the next 3-5 years. While growth has slowed dramatically (to the point of potentially being nonexistent) in the company's core US online segment, the past few years demonstrate, to me, that founder-CEO Greg Strakosch has built a set of relationships and resources that can be leveraged into new offerings to keep the growth going. With high incremental margins, there's a lot of potential upside to earnings here if you have a long enough horizon.2015 Results Good, In ContextFrom a macroeconomic perspective, 2015 was a challenging year for TechTarget. Macro headwinds and the strong dollar made for a weak IT environment, which in turn affected marketing budgets. Moreover, several of TechTarget's specific clients are undergoing major corporate events - Dell-EMC, the HP and Symantec splits, etc - and this, inevitably, caused some disruption.Notwithstanding all that, TechTarget managed to deliver 5% y/y revenue growth, which it leveraged into 14% Adjusted EBITDA growth. Core online North American revenues shrank a little bit, while International revenues grew roughly 10%; both segments are expected to post similar y/y performance in 2016.IT Deal Alert continues to stand out, up nearly 40% y/y; it posted $23 million in revenue, or just over 20% of the total, despite being launched from zero in late 2012. This will continue to be one of the major growth drivers going forward; it's expected to grow 40% year on year, with potential upside to 50%, and the company's 3 - 5 year target is for this to comprise $80 - $100 million in revenue.Several new products will help them get there, including TechTarget Research, which the company expects to become an eight figure revenue stream in the next two years. This is a new offering that allows both vendors and investors to get real-time visibility into the deal environment; investors value historical information, while vendors are more interested in figuring out what's going on right now. Given the company's success with IT Deal Alert, I think the research products will gain significant traction over the next few years.The one dull spot is core North American online operations, which look to be pretty mature at this point. The company is expecting mid-high single digit growth out of this segment over the long term, although I'm not sure if this is actually achievable - against an easy comp, the company's growth forecast for next year doesn't imply any growth in this segment. I do think it can grow, but it will likely be subject to the vicissitudes of the IT spending environment.Quality Content Continues To WinTechTarget is fundamentally different from garden-variety lead-gen businesses or content farms in that (in my opinion) its sites are designed to educate users rather than simply funnel them to advertisers or sponsors. At the risk of being self-serving, a good analogy that you will likely be familiar with is the difference between content on Seeking Alpha and content on Motley Fool. The latter is clickbait-y - every few paragraphs, they try to sell you on their newsletters, making many articles feel like little more than excuses to entice you into clicking further because you're curious what technology will make trillions over the next decade. Seeking Alpha, on the other hand, doesn't try to stick itself in the middle of its contributors and readers - the goal is to leave readers better off than they were when they encountered the site.Similarly, at TechTarget, the content is high-quality, written by and for real people. This piece on the newly-launched SearchSalesforce site is a good example - there's a podcast with a channel partner who recently attended a Salesforce launch event, along with a cogent discussion of the implications. That's not to say that they don't push lead gen - they certainly do - but the content is valuable whether or not you choose to submit your contact information to access additional content. Of course, I haven't reviewed every single one of their 150+ individual sites, but the experience was consistent across the handful that I did vet.This quality is increasingly important. It's old news at this point that Google algorithm changes are a risk to businesses that rely on organic search, yet the evolving algorithm continues to wreak havoc on formerly high-flying businesses. Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), though, is neither evil nor something to be scared of if you're doing business the right way. Google maintains its reputation by surfacing the best, most relevant results for users. The glory days of SEO are over. If you're trying to game the system, you'll get dinged; if you're providing stuff that's really valuable, it will stand out. Indeed, TechTarget's organic traffic was up 40% in 2015, and according to founder/CEO Greg Strakosch on the call, this strength continued into the early part of 2016:Traffic trends are particularly important because organic search traffic represents 95%+ of TechTarget's total traffic. This is either an unassailable competitive advantage or a risk factor depending how you look at it - the company estimates it would cost $300 million a year to replicate its traffic with paid traffic. Against $112 million in 2015 revenues and $24.5 million in Adjusted EBITDA, it clearly doesn't matter if this estimate is off by an order of magnitude - replacing organic search with paid traffic wouldn't be tenable without substantial changes in the business model.Valuation: A Rare Combination Of Quality And Value?I've been turning over a lot of rocks recently, but unfortunately, most of the high-quality names that I don't already own don't meet my rather high hurdle rate. TechTarget may be one of the rare exceptions - although there are still several ""due diligence"" issues that I'm digging into here, this one is pretty high up on my watchlist.For starters, the company is trading at 6.2x forward ""Adjusted"" EBITDA based on guidance, with a clean balance sheet (a chunk of net cash, no debt). Stock-based compensation is fairly significant, though - a quarter of adjusted EBITDA - so I choose to back that out. On the other hand, capex is minimal (~$4 million per year).The long-term story here is operating leverage; incremental margins are in the 50 - 60% range, and guidance for 2016 implies incrementals of ~56%. If you start with the company's 3-5 year revenue targets and assume they will be achieved, total (adjusted) EBITDA at the end of the period will be in the neighborhood of $80 - $85 million, assuming the low end (50%) of incremental margins.Subtracting out my estimates of stock-based comp and keeping capex steady as a percent of revenue, I get to $50 million of GAAP EBIT - which, at a seemingly reasonable 10x multiple, would equate to a $500 million enterprise value or $16 per share by 2020 or so (vs. a sub-$200MM EV and $6.60/share today). There would likely still be room for upside if the company continued growing/executing, although given how core North American online revenues have slowed down, it might be wise to temper long-term growth expectations for IT Deal Alert and International.Obviously, this is the bull case, and I'm still fiddling around with what numbers I feel comfortable using as my base case (and bear case). That said, there's clearly upside here even if management doesn't get all the way to these targets, and the stock is fairly reasonable on LTM/NTM numbers (although not quite as cheap as I'd personally like).Notably, my calculations above don't assign any value to free cash generated in the interim. Unlike altogether too many technology companies, I think TechTarget will deploy capital wisely. At the moment, they're focused on buybacks, as they think their stock is undervalued. I would expect this to continue. Incidentally, some of this may be in the form of off-market private purchases from significant shareholder Technology Crossover Ventures - i.e. TCV - which, as one of the Series B and Series C has been in the company for over a decade. TCV has been selling down, and I expect this to continue.Wrapping It UpTechTarget is the sort of business I like - underfollowed and nichey, with no public comps. It doesn't hurt that I like founder-CEO Greg Strakosch - his shareholder letters are great, and so is his management style. In his own words, he detests bureaucracy and silly policies. In other words, he's one of the few managers who ""gets it"" and the company has been named a great place to work by many sources. It's hardly Camp Cupcake, though; it's a demanding, results-oriented work environment and Glassdoor reviews confirm this.There are still several issues that I'm considering here; I also take a lot of time trying to understand the history of the business and where it's come from (rather than just where it is today). Nonetheless, I wanted to surface the name for SA Pro subscribers, as I believe this is one of few companies that's really worth taking your time to research rather than just surveying the high-level numbers and moving on. Please leave a comment or send me a direct message if you've followed the company for a long time and would like to chat - I'd love to get some other perspectives here.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

2198463,35401,2014-05-07T11:43:57-04:00,"TTGT reported upside quarter and raised guidance last night.New product, IT Deal Alert, growth is accelerating.Extreme operating leverage of TTGT model is becoming evident.","Refer to this article for the basic thesis on TechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT). In short the company manages 150 different technology websites all focused on the enterprise IT buyer. If a CIO is researching a purchase of routers, he would go to TTGT's Networking website where he could learn about the trends in routing and gather information on the available router choices. TTGT's core business is to sell leads based on the what its users click on its sites to the IT vendors selling products such as routers.This has been a good business for the company which grew its revenues from $30m to $100m from 2005 to 2011. At that point, the company hit a bit of a speed bump as its large IT vendor customers had declining revenues and consequentially cut back on their marketing budgets, hurting TTGT's business. Revenues dropped 15% over two years and because the company has a highly fixed cost structure, EBITDA dropped significantly.Beginning in Q4 2013, core revenue began to flatten out for the company opening the door to revenue growth from two sources. First, the company's international business is growing at 20%+ and now at 30% of the total business its growth is beginning to make an impact. Second and more important, the company's new product IT Deal Alert is beginning to grow rapidly and accounted for 15% of total revenue in Q1 2014. Data mining all of the user data from its 11.5m users on its 150 websites, TTGT is able to figure out which IT customers are looking to make an imminent purchase decision. It then sells this data to its IT vendor customers on a subscription basis. This is basically the best kind of sales information a tech company could have because it allows them to focus on the hot deals and not waste time on customers who are not in the buying mode. This business did $4m for TTGT in 2013 and the company is (conservatively) looking for it to grow 400% in 2014.The company last night raised its revenue guidance from ""double digit"" (read 10%) to low-to-mid teens growth for the year. I believe this guidance is very conservative and wouldn't be surprised if the company grew 20% this year. On the EBITDA front, the company raised EBITDA growth guidance for the year from 50% to 80%. Due to the company's highly fixed cost structure, incremental revenue growth drops nearly unhindered to the bottom line. We feel that the company can eventually generate 40% EBITDA margins which would result in at least a 3-bagger in stock price from here.Disclosure: I am long TTGT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
2069463,35401,2014-03-05T14:04:38-05:00,"Techtarget's new product, it deal alert, will drive significant revenue growth over the next few years.International expansion will fuel additional revenue increases.Highly fixed cost business means ebitda dropdown of 70%+.","TechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT) is an online media company with terrific top line growth potential and even better EPS growth potential. The company has fallen off investors' radar screens as a revenue slowdown at its big customers has caused a 15% drop in TTGT revenue. TechTarget is poised to reverse these revenue losses with growth in its international business and new revenue from its recently introduced product, IT Deal Alert.TechTarget operates 150 unique websites focused on the enterprise IT professional. These sites have proprietary content written by the company's 150 editors to educate IT professionals and help them when they are looking to make IT purchases. In addition to this content, each website has data sheets and white papers provided by IT vendors such as IBM, HP, Cisco, VMware, etc. The company tracks which of its (11.5 million) registered users clicks on this IT vendor content and then sells these leads to that particular IT vendor. This is the company's core business and has been very successful, growing revenue from $45 million in 2004 to $105 million in 2011 and achieving 20% EBITDA margins by 2011. This business has seen a 15% decline from 2011 to 2013 due to marketing cutbacks at its large customers as these customers suffered from slowing revenue growth and even revenue declines. Currently it seems that there has been stabilization in this market although the company sees significant revenue growth without any snapback in customer spending in the near term.International expansion has driven 25%+ international revenue growth over the past couple of years and that is slated to continue and have a larger effect on the overall P&L as this segment grows. The international market is far less penetrated than the domestic market and is experiencing the shift from offline to online marketing that the U.S. saw 3 - 4 years ago. These trends cause TTGT's newly launched international sites to grow rapidly for the first few years of their existence. While the company has launched a number of site overseas, there are still plenty of untapped markets left for them to explore.The most exciting part of the TechTarget story is their product launched last year, IT Deal Alert. This product is a Big Data product that crunches all of the user data that the sites collect and then is able to predict which firms are looking to make imminent IT purchase decisions. Techtarget is selling this data on a subscription basis, akin to the software-as-a-service model used by richly valued firms such as Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) and salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). The uptake by customers has been tremendous with sales going from zero in Q1 2013 to 12% of sales in Q4 of 2013. The company is predicting that this product's revenue will triple in 2014, a conservative prediction given its level in Q4 2013 and its 20% sequential growth prediction for Q1 2014.The icing on the cake is TTGT's tremendous operating leverage. Since the cost of operating its network of websites is relatively fixed, each additional dollar of revenue contributes 90 cents to the gross margin line and close to 70 cents to EBITDA. The company believes that a doubling of revenue would also double its EBITDA margin from 20% to 40%. This would result in EPS growing 4x over 2011 levels. Given that the majority of the company's revenue at that point would be subscription, the company could garner a SaaS multiple of some 25x earnings.So just doing the math, TTGT earned $0.32 in 2011. If the company succeeds in doubling revenue in three years and quadrupling EPS, EPS at that point would be $1.28. Putting a 25x multiple on that gets you to a $32 stock price, a 4-bagger from current levels.Management happens to be very good at the company. The CEO, Greg Strakosch has done two self tenders in the past four years. These have had the effect of being accretive and reducing the VC overhang. There are two remaining VC shareholders who need to be out of the stock over the next year or so. The company may do another tender and / or may do a secondary offering of these VC shares.Disclosure: I am long TTGT. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1861041,41741,2013-11-25T09:58:37-05:00,,"As far as share buybacks go, TechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT) gets things done. Last month, the company repurchased 7.1 million shares, 600k shares higher than the original tender offer, at $5 a share. This reduced shares outstanding by 18.3%. It was a great buy as shares are trading above $6 today.We think the move higher in TechTarget shares is just getting started and we see much higher prices over the next 12 to 18 months.A focus on the B2B market for corporate IT products and servicesWhile we have been critical of the IT advertising market before, such as our critique of TechTarget competitor QuinStreet (NASDAQ:QNST), that is not the case with TechTarget. Whereas QuinStreet focuses on the B2C marketplace, TechTarget is focused on the key B2B market.TechTarget operates a network of over 130 websites that focus on a specific niche in the IT sector. These specific areas include data center management, storage architecture, networking, security, disaster recovery/compliance, business intelligence, application development, cloud computing, and virtualization. The site's content and brand advertising is geared towards bringing together buyers and sellers of corporate IT products. In other words, TechTarget is focused on the growing B2B market for IT products and services.TechTarget offers a customized marketing program for IT vendors to ensure that they reach the corporate decision makers that are purchasing IT products and services. The company also establishes in-person events that enable IT providers to target customers directly. Lead generation accounts for the majority of the company's revenues.Favorable reviewsAccording to glassdoor, 62% of employees approve of CEO Greg Strakosch. The positive aspects included:The cons that employees outline focus on low pay. As we'll discuss further, this is expected, since the company mainly provides online content and that is not something associated with high salaries. Furthermore, TechTarget also relies on industry experts outside the company for a good portion of its content.Content is kingTechTarget relies on content and providing the information IT professionals need. The company employs 150 full-time editors who create content tailored towards specific audiences. The company complements this content with additional content from 750 industry experts. Registered members of its sites are able to conduct their pre-purchase research by accessing vendor content such as white papers, webcasts, videocasts, virtual events and podcasts. Its network of websites also allows users to seamlessly interact and contribute content, which is highly valued by IT professionals during their research process.Valued membership baseThe strong content base that TechTarget provides has a loyal following of 11 million registered users. It's this database of registered users that is so valuable. This is simply because they do purchase IT products and services. They're just looking for the right product/service to fit their company's needs.Last year, TechTarget provided advertising campaigns for approximately 1,200 customers. One customer accounted for 12% of revenues and the top 100 customers have a renewal rate of 97%. This strong renewal rate comes from over 13 years of proven results with consistently high organic Google rankings and built on organic traffic.B2B is a large and growing marketTechTarget will benefit as more B2B advertising spending goes digital. The total B2B internet advertising market has grown from $2.8 billion in 2010 to an estimated $4.3 billion next year. In 2005, digital advertising spending was only 9% of the B2B advertising market. Next year, it's forecast to account for 27% of total B2B spending. It's this growth that will drive the top- and bottom-lines for TechTarget.Traditional IT media consists of print publications and trade shows. Now, it is much easier for IT professionals to search the Internet and find the products and services that they need. It is this trend that TechTarget is at the core of. TechTarget offers the most targeted advertising platform in the IT-spending market, even compared to traditional IT print publications and their digital offerings.Membership gains continueTechTarget continues to add new members at an average rate of 50,000 per month. The company gets the vast majority of its traffic organically or directly. Over time, the company has been able to greatly reduce its SEM (search engine marketing) spending over time as revenues have grown. SEM spending now accounts for less than 2% of online revenues.The company gets 59% of its traffic from SEO, 26% directly, and only 15% is paid for. Paid search is effective in launching new sites, driving impressions to support branding revenue and increase traffic in high-demand areas.New Activity Intelligence programsThe latest innovation from TechTarget is its Activity Intelligence programs. The Activity Intelligence dashboard was launched in 2011 for sales and marketers that provides greater functionality. Before, users had to rely on a spreadsheet-like format to view their day. Today, 500 customers are using the dashboard and conversion rate has increased significantly. The ability to convert a lead to a sale is the ultimate end-goal for TechTarget's customers.Last year, the company launched its Nurture & Notify program. This add-on service has been used in over 100 lead-generation campaigns. What's great about this product for TechTarget is that there is a 15% to 25% upcharge for this add-on.In 1Q of this year, TechTarget launched IT Deal Alerts, which is its new sales intelligence tool. This tool provides sales teams with alerts and insights on active technology deals. This is a further example of TechTarget being able to mine its data using existing data points in its data warehouse. This is a service billed monthly. This continues TechTarget's path to create recurring revenue streams that are in addition to, but billed separately from its marketing campaigns.Growth in international marketsFor TechTarget, the greatest opportunity lies in international markets. The company started its international expansion in 2008 with the launch of its first websites in the U.K. In 2009, the company launched sites in India and Spain and Singapore last year. Last year, 21% of revenues of revenues came from international markets, which was about 50% higher than the prior year. Long-term, the company sees international markets eventually accounting for about 35% of total revenues.Focus on tuck-in acquisitionsTechTarget plans to continue growing via select tuck-in acquisitions. Their strategy is to target under-monetized sites with good content and traffic. The company can then leverage its 75-member sales team and its 1,200 customers. TechTarget seeks acquisitions that involve a minimal cash outlay and a high ROI. Recent examples include brianmadden, BeyeNETWORK, ComputerWeekly, LeMagIT, and MicroScope. The last three were overseas. ComputerWeekly and MicroScope are based in the U.K. and LeMagIT is based in France.Investment thesisOne of the main things that we like about TechTarget is that company directors, officers and major shareholders own approximately 61% of the company. That explains the stock's average daily volume of about 32k shares and why only three analysts follow the company, of which only two were on the latest earnings call. We see TechTarget as an undiscovered gem in the IT spending market.We also like the recent share buyback that reduced the outstanding share count by 18.3%. The company has about $32 million in cash and no debt to fund further share buybacks. The buyback at $5 was just above its current book value of $4.94. In the past three years alone, TechTarget has returned over $83 million to shareholders by repurchasing approximately 15.7 million shares.In looking at the valuation, the stock trades at only 2.1x sales and 1.2x book. In terms of earnings, we see next year's EPS returning to FY11 level of $0.25. This is above the consensus of $0.21. We see TechTarget come in higher than expectations as the company has come in higher in two out the last four quarters and in the other two quarters, the company met expectations. We also see margin expansion helping to boost EPS. The current gross margin is 70%, but the company needs to boost its operating margin from negative 0.18%.With an EPS of $0.24, the stock currently trades a forward P/E of only 24. In looking at another favorite of ours in the digital marketing space, Responsys (NASDAQ:MKTG) trades at 3.9x EV/Sales. TechTarget, on the other hand, trades at only 1.7x EV/Sales. For TechTarget, next year's revenues are forecast to grow at least 8.7% to $96 million according to analysts; however, the company is forecasting double-digit revenue growth.In looking forward, our confidence rests on what CEO Greg Strakosh said on the 3Q earnings call about his outlook for the business (emphasis ours).Where we could be wrongA big concern that we have is an overall reduction in corporate IT spending. In an economic contraction, one of the first items targeted by corporations to reduces costs is overall IT spending. As you can see from this longer-term chart, the financial crisis had an impact on shares of TechTarget.Bottom lineIf we assign the same current multiple to TechTarget as Responsys, we get a target price of $11. At that level, TechTarget will boast an EV/Sales multiple of 3.9x, the same as Responsys. We're being conservative in our assessment if we consider that competitor and another short of ours, Digital River (NASDAQ:DRIV-OLD), is trading at 13x EV/Sales. At $11, that's upside of 90% for TechTarget, or a return to pre-2009 levels.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1930041,23552,2014-01-07T12:00:00-05:00,,"IntroductionDespite the dramatic appreciation of ""Big Data"" technology growth stocks such as Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK), Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA), and Datawatch (NASDAQ:DWCH), there is one company that investors have overlooked, which recently launched a new Big Data Analytics product of its own that's driving blistering revenue growth and high incremental margins falling straight to the bottom line. Furthermore, this new revenue stream is de-risking the company by providing enhanced earnings stability that's barely priced into the current share price.We believe TechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT) is an overlooked opportunity for investors to play a recovery in IT ad spending, while independently benefiting from the company's new efforts to harness the power of Big Data to drive accelerating profits. The company's primary business - a network of specialized websites that serve enterprise IT professionals - is expected to return to growth in 2014 as technology companies shift marketing dollars from offline to online channels, and as fast-growing websites in international markets become a larger part of the company's revenue mix.However, what excites us the most, and what could become the company's new crown jewel, is its recently launched Big Data product called IT Deal Alert Qualified Opportunities. Launched at the end of Q2 2013, the company announced it already expects to have on boarded 85 new customers by the end of 2013. With customers signing annual contracts in the range of $120,000/year, this new $10m revenue stream fundamentally changes the earnings profile of the company by providing a more stable earnings stream at an incremental EBITDA margin of 40%. Whereas TTGT's revenue base has historically been dependent on advertising rates with significant quarterly variability, its new contractual revenue stream will provide enhanced earnings stability to the company. We believe the IT Deal Alert is largely being overlooked by investors and Wall St. analysts (only 3 small brokerage firms cover the company), and has the potential to drive significant returns to investors by harnessing just a fraction of the company's existing customer base.It's no wonder the company tendered for 7.1 million of its shares at $5/share in October 2013, which dramatically cut its share count by 17.5%. This isn't the first time the company has used an irrationally low price to opportunistically buyback its stock. In November 2010, the company tendered for 5.9m shares at $6/share. We believe these shareholder friendly actions will prove prescient for future share price appreciation as the stock's float has shrunk dramatically. TTGT's management beneficially owns approximately 15% of the shares, and have been committed to the business for the long-term. For example, the CEO Greg Strakosch founded the company and has guided its growth, while numerous other members of management have been involved for over a decade. We generally like to invest with companies that have a stable management team, meaningful skin in the game, and a history of shareholder friendly actions.We believe the current share price has significant downside protection and prices in none of the upside potential. TTGT has ~$1 per share in cash, zero debt, and trades at just 1.0x book value. Our 2014E estimates conservatively assume TTGT can penetrate just 10% of their existing client base (currently ~4% after 2 quarters since launch) to use IT Deal Alert. In this scenario, we believe there is significant upside to the current consensus estimates, and that the share price may appreciate 30-60% in the next 6 to 12 months.BackgroundTechTarget operates a network of over 130 websites focused on the enterprise IT professional. When an IT professional is researching a technology purchase, he or she will visit one of TechTarget's websites to learn more about that type of product from relevant articles, data sheets, white papers, webcasts, and vendor comparisons. This information is created by TechTarget's 150 full-time editors and over 300 outside experts, or can be provided by outside partners as sponsored material. IT vendors pay TechTarget for sponsored content and for leads generated by potential customers visiting the sites. TechTarget's network of websites has a valuable asset in its 12 million registered members, giving the company a wide competitive moat. TechTarget's core offering has grown revenue from $32 million in 2003 to $100 million in 2012 (15% CAGR).TechTarget's core business is unique in the value proposition that it brings both to its users and its vendors. Its users can find the granular information they need on one site at no cost to them. There are virtually no competitors that offer a similar product breadth. Vendors can get in front of an audience that is looking to make a purchase of a specific type of technology product at a critical time in the purchasing cycle. This valuable audience has given TechTarget pricing stability over time, leading to annual price increases in most years. Renewal rates have been above 90% historically, and TechTarget has over 1,000 active advertisers including names like Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), Dell (NYSE:DELL), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (NYSE:SAP), salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Splunk , and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY).The company's business continues to benefit from the migration of advertising from offline venues to the web. Driven by increasing time spent online, advertisers are decreasing offline ad budgets in order to fund online ones. A March survey of 253 marketers conducted by Gartner found that 28% of companies are reducing traditional advertising budgets specifically to fund digital marketing activities. Digital marketing is currently a minimal expense for these companies, representing only 2.3% of sales, and is expected to grow significantly in excess of traditional marketing channels.Growth Opportunities and Earnings PowerTechTarget's sales have declined in the last two years as large IT vendors have constrained both offline and online marketing spend in the face of flagging sales. This trend has had a most pronounced effect on the company's domestic revenues. The downward sales trend is set to reverse sharply in 2014 as a result of numerous factors.TTGT has mitigated some of the domestic softness, by rapidly expanding into international markets. In 2010, only $5.2m or 5.5% of TechTarget's revenue was generated outside of the U.S., but this revenue stream grew by 180% to $14.6m (14.6% of sales) by the end of 2012. In the first three quarters of 2013, international sales constituted 20% of total company sales. Given the large addressable global market, we believe the company can conservatively attain 15-20%+ annual international revenue growth over the next few years.However, the biggest contributor to growth in 2014 will be TechTarget's new Data Analytics offering, IT Deal Alert. IT Deal Alert uses Big Data techniques to mine the vast quantities of information collected from the activity of TechTarget's 12 million registered users and produces a list of companies that are likely looking to make an IT purchase in the near future. Officially launched as a subscription offering in Q2 2013, IT Deal Alert allows the vendors advertising on TechTarget's sites to see which enterprises are making imminent technology purchasing decisions, giving their sales reps a very targeted funnel of high-quality, actionable leads. These leads have proven extremely valuable to early adopters of IT Deal Alert, resulting in a rapidly growing subscriber base. IT Deal Alert is set to close out 2013 with 85 subscribers (less than 5% of TechTarget's advertisers) at a $10 million revenue run-rate. As existing customers expand their subscriptions to include new product categories and new advertisers sign up, sales of IT Deal Alert will continue to outperform.In speaking with management, we learned that TechTarget has an addressable market opportunity of over 2,000 existing customers, with each annual subscription costing $100,000 - $120,000, and carrying a 40% EBITDA margin. It becomes easy to see why we're so excited about this growth opportunity: 1) TTGT has barely scratched the surface in rolling out the product amongst its large customer base; 2) the product's EBITDA margin vastly exceeds its current margin, which will provide tremendous earnings leverage, and; 3) the contracts are annual in nature, which will provide a more stable earnings streamIn the table below, we have modeled the potential impact on the stock price at various levels of client penetration to IT Deal Alert. We've assumed that the incremental EBITDA gets valued at 13.0x, which is about in-line with the Street's current valuation for 2014E EBITDA. We believe the current sell-side analysts are baking in no more than 5% penetration into their current models, which means that any further penetration represents an upside surprise to Street estimates. We conservatively believe that TTGT can increase its penetration to the 10-15% percent range, which would represent 30 - 60% upside in the stock price from its current level.On the company's last conference call, the CEO confidently said that he expected double digit online revenue growth, and that his forecast did not even depend on a recovery in IT spending. In other words, any improvement in domestic IT ad spending, will provide a further upside surprise catalyst to 2014 earnings.The Street is currently estimating 2014 revenues, EBITDA, and EPS of $96.2m, $13.8m, and $0.21c/share, respectively. However, if the company can achieve 10% - 15% penetration for IT Deal Alert, then it has the potential to produce ~$115m, $21m, and $0.40c/share in earnings in the 2014-2015 period. This puts the forward earnings valuation, adjusted for the company's $1.02/share in excess cash, somewhere in the 12x - 16x range.ValuationAs a specialized Internet media company with limited universal competition, accelerating revenues and earnings from a brand new Data Analytics segment, and a high incremental margin financial model, TechTarget is poised for a breakout of earnings and multiple expansion in 2014.For a relative valuation analysis, we believe that the best peer set is comprised of Internet media, marketing, and information service providers, including Yahoo! (YHOO), IHS (IHS), Gartner (NYSE:IT), Bankrate (NYSE:RATE), WebMD (NASDAQ:WBMD), and QuinStreet (NASDAQ:QNST). If we exclude the outliers on the high and low end, this peer set trades at an average of 3.5x, 13.5x, and 24.5x 2014E revenues, EBITDA, and EPS, respectively, and at 3.5x book value. TechTarget trades at a meaningful discount to peers based on consensus estimates, but a dramatic discount to peers if our 2014/2015 numbers from above materialize.So given these rosy possibilities, why does TechTarget trade where it does today? Primarily we think it results from a lack of investor awareness owing to the company's small size, lack of sufficient analyst coverage, and the absence of a well-defined peer set. We also believe shares have also been constrained by an overhang from TechTarget's biggest shareholder, venture capital fund Technology Crossover Ventures (TCV), which owns approximately one-third of the stock. TCV's ownership limits trading volumes and keeps many larger institutional holders out of the stock. TCV owns TechTarget in a 2004 vintage fund, and may look to reduce or liquidate its holdings in the near-term. A liquidation of TCV's stake could be effected in three ways, and we believe each one would be a material positive for the company. First, TechTarget could do another large share repurchase. Second, shares could be offered in a secondary offering which would be promoted through a re-marketing of the company to the Street, drumming up significant new investor interest. Third, TCV could effect a sale of the entire company. The sale scenario is not a far stretch as TCV has board seats and would maximize its own incentive fees by selling at a higher price. Given TechTarget's financial profile, growth opportunities, and cheap valuation, the company would be of obvious interest for private equity buyers, as well as traditional media companies in search of growth.Summary2014 is shaping up to be a breakout year for TechTarget's share price. The rapid adoption of its new Big Data product IT Alert, and large opportunity to further its penetration, leaves a long runway for upside earnings surprises in 2014. The recently completed tender offer in November dramatically reduced the share count by 17.5%, and still leaves over $1/share and the balance sheet to offer downside protection at the current price. Given the large earnings growth opportunities, TTGT's share price is still valued at a dramatic discount to other internet media peers since most investors and analysts are unaware of the story. Our conservative estimates for IT Alert penetration assume no marked recovery in IT advertising, or valuation expansion, and still suggest 30% - 60% upside from the current price.Disclaimer: This research report expresses Spruce Point Capital Management LLC's (""Spruce Point"") opinions.

35539,20748,2007-05-15T04:20:09-04:00,,"TechTarget's IPO is scheduled for this week. The company provides online content about IT and targets buyers and sellers of IT products.  It competes with IDG, CMP Media, and Ziff Davis Media.  CNET (NASDAQ:CNET) is the most similar public comparable, although TechTarget has a slightly more enterprise focus. 
Here are the quick details:
Proposed ticker: TTGT
Price range: $12-$14 (I use $13 for my assumptions)
Shares: 39m
Market Cap: $507m
Cash: $105m (post IPO)
Debt: $20m
Enterprise Value: $421m
'05 EBITDA: $13m

'06 EBITDA: $20m (+51%)

'07 EBITDA: $26m (+30%) - my rough estimate
'07 EV/EBITDA: 16x
This compares to CNET's '07 EV/EBITDA of 14x, growing EBITDA roughly 20%.  The valuation seems reasonable but not overly enticing.   
On the positive side, both TTGT and CNET may be acquisition targets for their high quality original content (see Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) acquisition of DPReviews yesterday as an example of M&A in the digital content sector).  On the negative side, both firms have a heavy concentration of technology advertisers and are subject to fluctuations in the IT ad market. 
The offering will be for 7.7m shares and will raise roughly $75m to be used to pay down debt, for working capital and for general business use.  Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers will be the lead underwriters.
I think TTGT will have a solid but not spectacular IPO."
2277353,24410,2014-06-19T13:38:18-04:00,"For many companies, the adage applies: The more favorable the Google impressions, the more traffic and the more revenue.Substantial companies such as eBay, Demand Media and RetailMeNot suffered losses in SEO visibility caused by Google's Panda algorithm updates – along with stock value losses.Unnoticed by the market, tiny TechTarget's SEO visibility and search traffic got crushed by last month's Panda update.Blinded by TechTarget's timing of a positive financial report with another public offering, investors also overlooked an insider's recent indirect share sales worth $17 million.","By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative ReporterTechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT) has peered into the gaping jaws of death.And those jaws belong to… a Panda.Not China's bamboo-chomping bear. Rather, it was Google's Panda update designed to snuff out low-quality content from Google's top search results pages.Many companies have suffered crushing declines in Google impressions caused by last month's Panda update - and corresponding losses in stock value.Now, TheStreetSweeper has found an overlooked Panda victim - TTGT.Shares of the Newton, Mass. company - which is focused on drawing traffic to generate IT leads - hit this year's high of $8.46 on June 10.However, the market was unaware that weeks earlier, the company lost more than 33 percent in search visibility, according to a list of losers and winners.With TTGT's significant decline in SEO visibility - which happened around the same time of a 5-million-share secondary offering - we think the market has missed a crucial factor.We believe the stock faces much more significant consequences than the 28 percent stock value slashing endured by a peer company caught by Panda.In a statement released to TheStreetSweeper, TTGT said organic traffic remains ahead of last year.TTGT went on to say that the company has adapted to the changes and has established a successful track record over time in terms of how the changes play out.Still, we're not sure why insiders have been selling. Regardless, investors may find various viewpoints on TTGT here.WHAT HAPPENED TO IMPRESSIONS?Jealously guarding its top search market share, Google began using the code-named ""Panda"" in 2011 to filter out poor content so that higher-quality content would rise in search rankings.Google's leader of the Webspam team, Matt Cutts, tweeted the launch of the Panda update on May 20. Within days, many websites watched as the dreaded drop in organic rankings turned into reality.Digital coupon marketer RetailMeNot (NASDAQ:SALE) fell victim to Panda's 4.0 wallop, according to Searchmetrics. SALE suffered a huge loss in its Google impressions and, within days, a record decline in stock.SALE plummeted over $8 - 28 percent - in just a few days. About three weeks later, SALE still has not been able to climb back to its old high-flying $30 level.Check the visibility loss for both TTGT and SALE, provided by the Searchmetrics Winners and Losers analysis.TTGT shows a greater than 33 percent decline in SEO (search engine optimization) visibility (not visits), the exact percentage drop suffered by SALE.""TechTarget just went overboard in pandering to Google,"" explained an analyst who requested anonymity.Compared with six weeks before Panda, SEO visibility (not visitors) dropped to about 86,000 from about 190,000.This drop is no small thing for TTGT.According to the May 25 prospectus that is part of its shelf registration of 5 million shares, TTGT considers search engine ranking a key competitive advantage:So Panda took a swipe at the company's very foundation just as TTGT climbed to an EPS of zero from a 4 cent loss the quarter before.Though other factors may have had some influence, it appears that Panda has accomplished its mission to uproot less impressive sites in its quest to improve visitors' experiences.Looking at the SALE chart and the TTGT chart - it's easy to see the spectacular drop in SEO visibility for both companies in mid-May.But something else jumps out when we compare TTGT and SALE stock price charts. Though they experienced the same visibility decline, their stock prices are completely out of sync. So the market recognized SALE's issues. But it has not recognized the very same issues with TTGT, below:SALE released a statement saying SALE ""experienced some shift in rankings and traffic,"" adding that it is diversifying its traffic sources.eBAY WRESTLES PANDAThat's not all. Panda's not-so-gentle paw also clamped down hard on the $62-billion mammoth eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY).eBay's experience with Panda prompted comments like this one from Business2Community:eBay hasn't released a statement on the visibility report, possibly because about the same time, eBay asked customers to change their passwords due to a cyber attack.While there may be other factors at work, relevant charts appear to reveal what eBay didn't. eBay's chart shows the major hit in SEO visibility and a stock decline that the company - obviously a far healthier company than TTGT - has not been able to shake.MAY 2013: PANDA CHEWS UP DEMAND MEDIAPanda really began making its presence known last year, when the third major rewrite offered webmasters a hand-wringing glimpse into the possible effects of algorithm updates. That rewrite smacked many, including eHow.com, the star property of Demand Media (DMD). The company depends on Google for more than half of its traffic, the 10-Q states.DMD's recent quarterly securities filing discloses the search engine algorithm changes may causeDMD's recent Securities and Exchange Commission document continues:The chart shows that the Panda hit marked the beginning of a stock value slide that persists to the current day. Unique visitors declined to over 80 million from 125 million, while revenues declined to $89.8 million from $101.1 million as operating losses rose.TTGT is definitely insignificant compared with substantial companies like EBAY, DMD and even SALE. But if Panda knocked the lights out of these companies, it's hard to imagine what it will do to scrawny TTGT and its investors.LIFE OR DEATH ISSUES GO BACK TO 2011Companies seem to live and die on that old adage: The better the Google impressions, the more traffic and the more revenue.Only three years ago, DMD shares traded for an overly optimistic $26. The astonishing stock slide to the current price of under $5 can be connected to those regular, sometimes monthly, updates of the deceptively passive-sounding Panda.People were eating up DMD's ""how-to"" website, eHow, in December 2010 with questions like, ""How to brew beer,"" or ""How to fix a toilet,"" or ""How to groom a dog."" But no one posed what might well be one of the most important questions to DMD's existence, ""How to avoid Panda.""Google was already aiming at spam-riddled, thin, aggregated content with weapons code-named Panda, Penguin and Hummingbird.Just three months after DMD ventured out with its IPO at $17 in January 2011, a rewritten, soft-eyed Panda lay waiting at its doorstep. Teeth bared.When Panda bit that April, DMD shares plummeted after an SEO software firm published a report saying eHow had suffered a 66 percent decline in visibility on Google since that Panda update.DMD, much like SALE, issued a statement pooh-poohing the report, stating the company had seen an impact but the decline was ""significantly overstated."" The company followed up with a quarterly report showing an estimated 20 percent decline in search referrals. However, the next quarter's report showed that was not quite right. Revenue had not grown from its $79.5 million level, and the report concluded that Panda caused ""a substantial reduction in the total number of search referrals.""There's been no statement from TTGT, of course, since Panda's impact on the company has been unknown - until now.Word is that Google will continue providing Panda updates.CONCLUSIONTTGT has gained investors' good graces by reporting improved guidance, a new product and a better-than-expected $23 million quarterly revenue, plus a paltry $135,000 net income after a loss. Generally, it's flying under the radar.Market blindness toward TTGT's issues - combined with the release of a positive earnings report the same day a public offering was kicked off - created an atmosphere that allowed the smooth sale of millions of TTGT shares.TTGT director Jay Hoag and others indirectly sold 2.8 million shares for $17 million as part of the May public offering of 5 million shares - offered at a slight discount by Polaris Venture entities and by entities of Technology Crossover Venture, managed by Mr. Hoag. Selling shareholders, not TTGT, received the proceeds.Those shareholders joined other insiders who may have been tipping their hand, as they've sold multi-millions worth of TTGT in just the last six months. In fact, insiders have sold and sold over the years, pocketing upwards of $63 million.Yet, TTGT is largely ignored by analysts, sports a ridiculously generous $6 price target and reports yearly revenue declines that have deepened since 2011. The operating income of this company with the astounding $265 million market cap has consistently dropped, to the point of losing $2.5 million in 2013.Now, TTGT must try to overcome that seemingly gentle, doe-eyed virtual monster that has chomped away at both search traffic and SEO visibility so vital to its business of delivering customers.The market has punished SALE, EBAY and DMD over their crushing Panda experience.Google's Panda has TTGT locked in its virtual fangs. Now the market knows, and the end result will be ugly.Search traffic clearly suffered too under Panda. Note the similar declines in search traffic in the charts below for TTGT and SALE, respectively.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

        Momentum has picked up as it seemed apparent that many institutions of higher learning would remain closed for the upcoming fall.
        But in spite of this, 2U's enrollment trends have barely lifted.
        2U is more of a for-profit education company than a technology play.","2U (TWOU) has been one of the stocks that has benefited most from the coronavirus. Last year, 2U suffered a huge reckoning as its share price cratered from all-time highs near $100 to all-time lows in the low teens. Investors questioned the company's business model - that is, the business of basically franchising out a university's brand and developing course content and attracting students for profit. The market balked at 2U's losses and its disappointing growth, and the stock faltered.This year changed everything, though. With schools having been shut down for most of the year, and with the most likely scenario being a virtual or partially-virtual 2020-2021 academic year, online education stocks like 2U have taken off again. And though 2U still hasn't made up for all of 2019's losses, its share price has more than doubled since the start of the year.Here's the rub, though: despite the massive lift in sentiment since the start of the pandemic, 2U's actual fundamentals have barely improved. Enrollee growth remains relatively low (this isn't the same as a Blue Apron (APRN) or a Wayfair (W) whose share price gains at least partially correlated with a completely rewritten growth story - 2U's growth trends are basically flatlined to last year) - while losses still remain elevated.I have remained bearish on 2U for years, and especially given the stock's recent unsubstantiated share gains, I remain fundamentally negative on this company's future. I argued in my prior article that while higher education enrollment tends to see a boost during economic recessions, the same might not be true for grad degree programs (which 2U specializes in), because many of the laid-off workers in the service sectors don't have bachelor's degrees to begin with. 2U's subpar enrollee growth seems to validate that thesis as partially true.Furthermore, investor enthusiasm on this name has further cloaked the inherent flaw in 2U's business model: the fact that it pays to develop virtually all course content online, pays for the marketing for all its classes, and only gets a revenue cut with the sponsoring university - and these universities basically only have to lend its brand name and existing educational content to the mix. But it's 2U that invests all the capital upfront for a new course, and 2U that takes the losses when classes don't fill up. Steer clear here. Investors' blind enthusiasm for anything tech-related this year has chased 2U shares higher, but there's very little fundamental value in this name.Let's now go through 2U's key second-quarter highlights in more detail. First let's take a look at revenues. Headline revenues as shown in the chart below seemed to grow 35% y/y, but as also noted in the slide a good chunk of that revenue ($36.6 million) was due to the contribution of an acquisition. Meanwhile, core revenues in 2U's grad school programs saw only a 14% y/y lift to $115.7 million.Figure 1. 2U revenue trendsSource: 2U Q2 earnings deckTwo observations here:With a ~2x lift in shares from the beginning of the year, I'd expect a lot more kick in 2U's results - so where's that coronavirus bump that we were expecting? Again, I don't like Blue Apron as a stock very much, but at least the coronavirus turned the company from double-digit revenue declines to low-teens growth. We don't see the same happening for 2U.Enrollments didn't move much either. See the chart below: 2U's enrollees grew only 18% y/y to 46,142 students (which, by the way, only represents a measly net-new add of ~400 students from the prior quarter):Figure 2. 2U grad program enrollment trendsSource: 2U Q2 earnings deckThat y/y trend, meanwhile, is also basically flat to Q1's 16% y/y growth rate and worse than Q4's 20% y/y trend.Here's the demand commentary that CEO Chip Paucek offered on the most recent earnings call:All of this commentary is future looking. Management is spewing a rosy picture about lead-generation and applications, but so far we haven't seen any results materialize. Meanwhile, 2U continues to generate losses. Trailing twelve-month cash flows for 2U sit at -$44.2 million - and if the company follows through on its intention to aggressively market new programs for the coming Fall, FCF could worsen:Figure 3. 2U FCF trendsSource: 2U Q2 earnings deckMeanwhile, 2U's balance sheet has only $194.8 million of cash versus $263.1 million of debt - or a net debt position of $68.3 million. It wouldn't be unlikely for 2U to take advantage of its current high share prices to issue a dilutive secondary offering and raise more cash to burn.2U's year-to-date share price gains are all hype - but in spite of ~2x gains, we've seen flat enrollment and revenue trends that don't appear to have seen any material benefit from the coronavirus, at least in the near term. Don't follow along with the herd; keep your hard-earned cash invested elsewhere."
4343525,104952,2020-05-06T08:22:52-04:00,"2U will continue to benefit from the increasing demand for online learning amid the COVID-19 outbreak.Q1 results were strong as the company managed to grow its top-line revenue by ~44% while significantly slowing down the growth in marketing expenses.Furthermore, Trilogy will be the future of 2U's business. it has been driving the growth in Alternative Credential's / AC segment. Since the acquisition last year, AC revenue has tripled.Acquired in 2019, Trilogy is in the fast-growing technology bootcamp business, which is highly complementary to 2U's core programs.We expect the AC segment to make up ~50% of 2U's business by the end of 2021.","As a company that enables educational institutions to deliver online courses, 2U (TWOU) has been getting a lot of demand for its services due to the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. In the past, we have written about how attractive the stock is. 2U is a good company given its track record of solid execution and leadership in a massively growing online education market. After an exceptionally strong Q1, the company will have a critical task ahead of maintaining the momentum into and beyond the full year. We believe that Trilogy will play an important role in the process.The increasing demand for online learning amid the COVID-19 outbreak creates a solid tailwind for 2U. In response, 2U has completed a $380 million convertible debt financing. The financing was strategic given that it would lower the cost of capital and increase 2U's financial flexibility. Essentially, it will allow 2U to be in a very good position to invest in new programs to take on new opportunities as it sees fit. The company has done this in Q1. As it saw an initial success with the undergraduate FCE program, it launched a second one in Q1.(source: Q1 earnings call)Going into Q2 and beyond, we expect Trilogy to continue driving the growth in the Alternative Credential/AC segment and eventually the whole 2U's business. Trilogy offers technical learning programs such as data analysis, cybersecurity, and web development. Trilogy's programs are also unique, given their overall market-driven approaches to Bootcamp-based learning that is highly practical. In our view, the combination between the Trilogy's approach and the academic content from 2U's partner universities will present a disruptive offering. The growth from Trilogy has been very strong so far while it is still scratching the surface. Upon the acquisition of Trilogy in Q1 last year, AC's revenue has tripled in just over a year. Driven by the increase in demand for these types of programs going forward, we expect AC to make up half of 2U's business by the end of 2021.As of Q1, Trilogy has already made up over 60% of the AC business. AC drove the overall 44% top-line growth in Q1 2020, which made it the historically strongest Q1 in over two years. On the other hand, 2U's largest business to-date, the FCE graduate program, only grew by 14% YoY. Moreover, strong demand will also allow 2U to continue cutting back on marketing expenses to achieve greater cost efficiency while maintaining its growth as it did in Q1. While growing its top-line revenue at ~44%, Marketing and sales expenses increased by only 29% YoY in Q1, which is a significant improvement from the ~55% average YoY increase last year.Despite the strong Q1 result, the company will still have some homework to do. Primarily, it will have a lot to do with streamlining the operations of Trilogy, which was a loss-making company despite its potential. Upon the Trilogy integration, 2U's consolidated net loss increased by 513% in 2019 to $234 million, driven by the very high operating expenses, which was 43% higher than the revenue.(source: company's 10-K)The fact that it was a VC-backed company with strong growth also means that it did not come cheap. At $750 million, 2U most likely paid a premium price for Trilogy. At the same time, the company will also need to maintain the momentum going into the Fall and beyond. One particular key task here is to decide the right pricing model for its new services. In preparation for the Fall, many of the new clients were adopting the two newly-launched solutions, OS Essential and Plus. Given that they were pretty recent, 2U did not seem to be certain just yet on the best way to maximize the revenues from these services. At the moment, the company appears to take a shorter-term approach as it looks to prioritize supporting its clients by quickly deploying a working system.2U is an attractive growth story with interesting upside potential in the growing online education market. Having traditionally focused on Graduate programs, 2U has expanded its offering by adding Undergraduate and Bootcamp-based programs as well. Furthermore, the management is both strong and strategic as execution has been solid.(source: stockrow)The current ~2.5x P/S is an attractive entry point opportunity for investors. At such P/S, the stock's valuation is at the lowest level in over six years. On the other hand, revenue has more than quadrupled while growth has been between 35% and 47% YoY within the same period. Furthermore, gross margin has been on a steady upward trend and has expanded by ~1,000 bps since 2013. The only key financial-related issue in 2U is its high operating expenses due to the Trilogy acquisition. So far, the company has done a good job of slowing down the increase in marketing expenses by ~2,500 bps relative to last year.Given the current tailwind, it is quite possible for 2U to beat its previously-withdrawn full-year revenue guidance of $716 million. A surprise beat will allow the stock to either sustain its current 2.48x P/S or return to its YTD-high of 2.8x P/S by the end of the year. Considering the 64 million shares, we have upgraded our target price to a more conservative ~$30 per share by the end of 2020."
4335950,105526,2020-04-03T20:33:35-04:00,"The COVID-19 pandemic necessitates a quick, effective transition to online learning platforms which 2U stands to benefit from.Reduced cash outflows in 2020 and 2021 should facilitate a positive free cash flow outlook.Potential privatization scenario could drive a re-rating from here.","Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU) has quickly implemented contingency plans to ensure its online offerings remain open amidst a stronger demand outlook. Thus, the company appears well-positioned to benefit as an online leader from an otherwise problematic situation, and I feel that the present circumstances may lead to longer-term increased appreciation and adoption of digital higher education.Further, the recent investor day event featured a notable focus on enhancing profitability and turning FCF positive in the near future. With 2U's prospects likely to improve going forward, and the stock trading at significantly below historical levels, I believe there is still room for the stock to re-rate from here. Key catalysts include a privatization scenario, which could see 2U trade in line with precedent transactions within the 2.9-5.8x multiple range.The recent investor day event provided insight into the company's roadmap, competitive advantages, and points of differentiation, which should help investors draw more comfort around the company's long-term financial model and guidance. Through the coming quarters, 2U is focused on expanding its training and product offerings to facilitate the migration of coursework to online platforms, in line with requirements following the COVID-19 outbreak.In particular, I would highlight the expedited launches of novel digital learning products, which likely points to a widespread increase in demand for TWOU's products through 1H20. New products include:This should accelerate enrollment growth across 2U's degree programs, short courses, and boot camps - all of which have shown tremendous growth rates in recent years.Source: Investor Day PresentationI would also draw confidence in 2U's increased focus on return metrics such as return on invested capital (ROIC). In particular, management was particularly focused on unit economics, a planned slower cadence of domestic graduate programs (DGP) launches, and reallocation of capital towards less costly short courses to drive the higher returns. In addition, the favorable steady-state margin profile of alternative credit course offerings should also assist in producing balanced growth in the coming years.Source: Investor Presentation2U's flexibility in adjusting variable costs (two-thirds of sales and marketing expenses were variable in 2019) also offers comfort for investor concerns around student enrollment fluctuations (though I would note this represents an unlikely occurrence). In addition, 2U's launch of five new DGPs in 2020 (compared to 17 in 2019) should have a net benefit of $80-100 million to cash flow heading into 2021.Source: Investor Presentation2U's strategic focus on providing products and tools in areas which are presently experiencing skills gap also presents an opportunity to drive incremental revenues going forward in the online program management (OPM) segment. Short courses and software development boot camps (which are less expensive to implement than full degree programs) are also likely to see robust demand due to the growing job market in data science, robotics, AI, and other similar subcategories. The company's clinical licensing programs should also see rising demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Source: Investor Day PresentationFurther, growing concern and dissatisfaction from students around the cost of higher education are likely to benefit OPMs, which offer greater accessibility and affordability. However, the OPM industry's competitive environment could also intensify in tandem as providers build novel, scalable online learning platforms, and discount prices to compete for market share. Nonetheless, I see plenty of room for growth, given the growth potential - the size of the OPM market is projected to reach $7.7 billion by 2025.Over the past weeks, shares of 2U have advanced over 25% against the market's broader trend of double-digit decline. This is partially driven by the company's perceived benefit from the aforementioned secular tailwinds related to the COVID-19 pandemic.However, I would also highlight the rumors of a sale in process for 2U (as reported by Dealreporter), which has likely influenced shares. On balance, I feel that 2U would represent an attractive opportunity for private equity due to the company's solid profitability and anticipated capacity to generate FCF. In addition, the company's planned focus on capital-light alternative credentials should drive margin improvement.Another key positive is the fact that 2U does not carry significant balance sheet risk that would dissuade potential buyers. Despite historically negative cash flow, the company holds $190 million of cash/equivalents at FYE19, with cash outflows likely to be lower in 2020. Additionally, 2U's $250 million term loan does not mature until 2024.Recent transactions in the edtech space have fallen within a 2.9x-5.8x revenue multiple range:Source: Company Data, Press ReleasesAssuming 2U commands a valuation at the lower end of recent transaction multiples, I think an ~$33 target price is fair, based on ~3x next year's revenues. With the stock currently trading at a multiple of 2.2x, significantly below its historical trading range, I see 2U as reasonably valued at these levels.Data by YChartsRisks to my price target span an intensifying competitive environment and its exposure to key third-parties such as students, educational institutions, and regulators, all of which could make decisions that materially impact the business's performance going forward."
4351599,105634,2020-06-02T17:41:42-04:00,"2U is losing money due to high marketing cost.Assuming more normal levels of S&M spend in a steady state, the stock appears undervalued.Investors interested in the Edtech space are essentially getting future growth for free, with a company that has an impressive track record and a leadership position in the OPM space.","2U, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWOU) is a $2.3 billion market cap global (however primarily US-based) Edtech company. The company had for a relatively long-time a nice growth story attached to it, where growth has come both from the organic side (driven by heavy S&M spend) and growth through M&A.As shown below, the stock was on fire during 2017 and half-way through 2018. But questions around ramp-up in profitability put heavy pressure on this equity. The recent upturn is, in my view, linked to increased interest in everything Coronavirus resistant and the fact that the company put up a decent Q1 2020 result.Source: Seeking AlphaThere have been several articles on Seeking Alpha covering from different viewpoints TWOU's merits or faults. In this article, I will briefly present the current bull and bear case and then put forth a more neutral value case (although more on the bullish side) and why the stock is an attractive play if an investor is seeking exposure to the Edtech space.The company explains the bull case themselves well in the latest earnings presentation:I generally hold a long-term view when investing. If I can't see myself holding an equity for 3-5 years, I generally avoid putting my money into something. It is impossible to know what is going to happen tomorrow or the next quarter (if somebody would know with absolute certainty what is going to happen in the future, he or she would be the richest person in the world). But if historical financials are impressive, the strategic circumstances favor a given company and the stock can be had at a decent price, good things are more likely to happen compared to when one of these criteria are not met. This is my main conclusion concerning TWOU.All of the financials I reference in this section can be found in the table below. The company's revenue growth (CAGR 45% FY11-19) has been fueled by acquisitions, purchase of intangibles and heavy S&M spend (S&M as % of revenues has averaged around 55% during the last six fiscal years).Although the company has operated with a loss during the whole period FY11-19 (operating loss was $246 million during FY19), this has mainly been driven by S&M spend (during FY19 the company spent $342 million on S&M). If the company were to decrease this spending at a given point in time, its profitability would increase, while of course slowing the top-line growth.Due to the recorded net loss, the company's ROIC was negative during the period FY11-19 (I define ROIC as FCFE (net income + D&A - Capex) over invested capital (NWC + Goodwill + Intangibles + PP&E), while if we were to adjust for excess S&M spend this would result in a positive ROIC.So what would a normal level of marketing expense in relation to revenue? A survey by Deloitte (referenced in this WSJ article) puts the average spend in the educational industry at 11% of revenue. While there are ambiguities around what exactly different companies include or exclude in this spend, let us assume (on the high-end) that TWOU would spend around 20% of revenues on S&M. What would TWOU's intrinsic value be given this change, not taking into consideration future growth?As highlighted below in the table, I calculate the difference between actual spending and this 20% scenario and add back the difference to net income. E.g. FY19 net income was $(235) million while I add back $228 million in excess S&M. Furthermore, I add back an impairment charge of $70 million to land at an adjusted net income figure. This translates into an adjusted FCFE figure and suddenly TWOU is showing positive ROIC figures.During the last six years, the adjusted ROIC figure would have been 17%, with a minimum of 12% and a maximum of 24%. During my research, I normally see ROIC figures between 7-12% for mature profitable businesses operating in commodity businesses. Given the leadership position and strong partnerships TWOU has, giving the company a strong moat for competitors to climb, it is not unreasonable to assume a range of steady-state ROIC of 15-25%.Translating this assumption into a valuation and given the invested capital structure per Q1 2020 (invested capital was $857 million) I land at a valuation range for an intrinsic value of $30-$50 per share. The stock was trading at around $37 as of this writing. Given the impressive growth history, an investor is essentially getting the growth for free, assuming my assumptions hold.I don't foresee debt as an issue, since if the company were to cut spending on S&M to more normal levels, Net debt/Adjusted Ebitda would have been around 1x (as shown in the table below).Source: Seeking alpha, public filings (10-K), Author analysisThe main risk concerning the future of TWOU is in my view the loss of partnerships with famous universities, as universities are pursuing their own offering instead of working with the company. Universities can also use this scenario to increase their bargaining power in negotiations around fees with the company.There are both convincing bull and bear arguments around the future of TWOU. However, I find the stock attractive at these levels, since considering steady-state S&M levels, the stock is currently worth between $30 to $50, and given the current stock price this implies an investor essentially receives the growth potential for free."
4343088,103480,2020-05-05T11:58:02-04:00,"Shares of 2U have drifted ~10% higher after the company reported mixed Q1 results that beat on EPS but were in-line on revenues.
        Investors have expected the coronavirus to push up enrollment in 2U's online education programs.
        So far, however, we've only seen enrollee growth in 2U's core grad programs decelerate.
        2U's cash buffer also remains quite thin, especially for a company that has to invest a lot upfront to get new programs running.","Though almost every company in the stock market has been routed this year, a select few technology stocks have seen their values maintain or even rise. Companies in this coveted group include e-commerce names like Amazon (AMZN), remote work stocks like Zoom (ZM) and Docusign (DOCU), as well as online education provider 2U (TWOU). Though 2U briefly lost more than half of its value when the market hit its nadir in mid-March, the stock has come roaring back since and recovered all of its year-to-date losses, especially after the company's recent Q1 earnings release.I have long been bearish on this name, and the coronavirus and the shifting of education to online venues hasn't changed my thinking on this stock. Investors should continue to steer clear of 2U and invest in more beaten-down areas of the tech sector. The majority of the market is betting that the shelter-in-place order and the increased openness to online education will drive a sudden spike in demand for 2U's offerings. 2U's CEO, Christopher Paucek, has posited on the Q1 earnings call that he expects the coronavirus to be a long-term tailwind to the company:On the other hand, I don't think the shelter-in-place situation necessarily creates a clear tailwind for 2U. I believe this argument to be flawed on two primary counts:Net/net, while I don't think the coronavirus will prove to be a headwind to 2U's business, neither do I think it'll provide the clear lift investors are hoping for. So far, we haven't seen fundamentals turn around. In Q1, 2U reported $175.5 million in revenues, growing grad program revenues by 14% y/y - accelerating two points over Q1's 12% y/y rate, but still a far cry from the growth rates in the mid-30s that 2U was capable to achieving in late 2018. Overall revenues were also only in-line with Wall Street's consensus target of $175.7 million. And despite the improvement in grad program revenue, enrollee counts aren't growing as quickly as we'd like. In Q1 in particular, 2U's grad program enrollees grew only 16% y/y to 45,734 - decelerating four points below last quarter's 20% y/y growth rate, and the first time that enrollee growth has slowed to the teens.Figure 1. 2U grad program enrollee trendsSource: 2U Q1 earnings deckWe can see that the two-point sequential acceleration in revenue was caused by a slightly-better average revenue trend, with 2U's revenue per FCE (full course enrollee) improving to a -2% y/y decline in Q1 versus a -7% y/y decline in Q2. We still find it concerning, however, that 2U has so far been unable to stabilize per-enrollee revenues, especially with development costs rising.Another secondary concern arises in 2U's balance sheet, shown below:Figure 2. 2U Q1 balance sheetSource: 2U Q1 earnings releaseAs of the end of Q1, 2U had only $138.2 million of cash on its balance sheet, against $244.6 million of debt. Now, after the close of this balance sheet, 2U had executed a $330 million convertible debt offering (due in 2025 and accruing 2.25% interest), but it expects to use the majority of the proceeds to refinance its long-term debt, and after doing so will only have $65.3 million of proceeds to apply toward working capital. This gives 2U about $203.5 million of liquidity, alongside a net debt position of $106.4 million (though slightly boosting its liquidity, 2U's convertible debt refinancing doesn't actually change its net cash/net debt position). 2U likes to present its cash flows on a trailing-twelve month basis - and indeed on a TTM basis, 2U's most recent -$58.5 million cash burn doesn't appear to heavy against its >$200 million of liquidity.Figure 3. 2U cash flow trendsSource: 2U Q1 earnings releaseBut 2U's expenses run much higher. In a case when 2U's ability to collect tuition payments is jammed and delays cash flow for whatever reason, its current high run rate of expenses could put it into a liquidity bind. In Q1, for example, 2U's operating costs ran at $229.4 million; after netting out $49.0 million in depreciation/amortization, stock comp, and non-cash lease charges, its ""cash"" operating expenses ran at $180.4 million this quarter, about half of which was in marketing and advertising costs.2U's growth depends in large part on its ability to both build new grad programs and advertise heavily to fill seats on those programs (recall that 2U bears the full upfront cost of setting up and marketing new programs; universities primarily lend only their branding and course content), so the company won't be able to curtail operating expenses liberally without harming its growth. If 2U does end up needing to cut advertising/student outreach budgets to preserve cash, we could see grad program enrollees continue to decelerate further.The market appears to be quite sanguine on 2U's prospects, but I'm skeptical that the coronavirus will present a true tailwind for 2U. If anything, I believe we'll see many more universities start offering their own online course content without intermediaries like 2U, given that building digital infrastructure has become a top-tier necessity for universities in the wake of the coronavirus. Given this stock's outperformance since the beginning of the year, expectations for 2U are high - I'd continue to stay on the sidelines here."
4322862,103480,2020-02-10T13:25:49-05:00,"Shares of 2U rocketed more than 10% after reporting Q4 results, despite showing worsening organic growth metrics.
        Acquisitions continue to be the primary driver behind 2U's growth. Its flagship graduate program, meanwhile, keeps suffering slowing enrollment trends.
        2U stock has seen a ~30% lift since hitting a January low, but only due to the rumor of a possible sale via activist intervention.
        2U's loss-leading business model is a bad fit for a market that has become very concerned with tech companies' profit margins.","A great cleansing is happening across the market right now. Ever since the spectacular flameout of WeWork's (WE) IPO, investors have dug into far deeper detail on companies' business models to assess underlying profit potential. Companies with low margin profile and deepening red ink are being flushed away. Take Casper (CSPR) for example. High-growth consumer companies like Casper with runaway revenue growth would have been a huge hit with investors several years ago, but Casper today stands below its IPO price and at a market cap less than half of its prior valuation.Against this market backdrop, I believe 2U (TWOU) is heavily at risk. I've consistently pointed out that this is a company that likes to dress up its technology aspects. And while 2U is certainly delivering university content via the web, it operates much more like a for-profit university than as a bona fide tech company. I won't rehash the details here, but essentially 2U's business model calls for the company to invest heavily upfront in digitizing individual course content and spending on marketing to attract students - because each course is different, the 2U ""product"" is far less scalable than a typical software company that builds one platform for all its customers.2U shares have fallen precipitously from 2019 highs above $70 as this business model became more transparent, but recent shares have picked up steam over January/February as the company reported Q4 results and rumors continue to stir on activist investors pushing for a sale. My take on 2U: continue to avoid this company like the plague. The market might have been forgiving on vague business models in the past, but 2U as it currently stands has a long road (if ever) to profitability, and investors are likely to punish the stock for it. Consistent negative free cash flow is constraining 2U's balance sheet, limiting its ability to make acquisitions - which is the source of the lion's share of its current >40% revenue growth rates. 2U is a bad fit for the current market environment, and shares have plenty further to fall especially after the phantom rally in January/February.The beating heart of 2U's business is its graduate degree program. It relies on consistent strong enrollment (from which it gets a revenue split with the sponsoring university) in order to pay back the investments it made into setting up the programs and advertising for students. Over the past year, however, we've only seen fundamental performance in 2U's grad programs deteriorate. Take a look at the chart below:Figure 1. 2U grad program trendsSource: 2U Q4 earnings deck""Full-course equivalents"" (FCEs), which is essentially a measure of how many students are enrolled in 2U's programs, has ontineud to see decelerating growth. The fourth quarter's growth rate of 20% y/y decelerated five points from the prior quarter, and is the worst quarter of growth across the two-year horizon. We note as well that the average revenue earned from a full-course enrollee in a 2U grad program has continued to trend downward. Q4 saw a seasonal lift from Q3 as we saw in prior years, but revenue per FCE of $2,595 was down -7% y/y, consistent with the prior quarter's -8% y/y drop. Deteriorating enrollment growth, as well as lower revenue per enrollee, don't help to justify the costs of setting up 2U's various degree programs.Yet 2U continues to report strong revenue trends. Taken at face value, and without diving into the underlying revenue components, investors would think 2U was growing revenues at 42% y/y (which would qualify it for tech sector multiples). When we look underneath the hood, however, we have to look at 2U's organic growth - the revenue growth generated by its flagship graduate degree programs, and not from its recent acquisition of several ""alternative credit"" programs from a company called Trilogy.Figure 2. 2U revenue trendsSource: 2U Q4 earnings deckUnfortunately, as we can see in the chart above, 2U's graduate program revenues actually grew at only 12% y/y, decelerating three points from the prior year and the worst quarter across the two-year timeframe (as recently as the first half of FY19, 2U was still growing grad program revenues at ~30% y/y). Organic revenue growth tracked closely to that at 13% y/y, again the worst performance across eight quarters.Let's take a minute as well to dig into 2U's balance sheet, shown below:Figure 3. 2U balance sheetSource: 2U Q4 earnings releaseAt the end of the prior fiscal year, 2U had $474.8 million in cash and investments. Now, 2U's cash balance stands at only $189.9 million - and that's not to mention that the company has added more than $240 million in long-term debt as well.The company's cash burn has been relentless (which, by the way, is not something that Wall Street wants to see at the moment). As we can see in the chart below, 2U's FY19 free cash flow losses stand at -$92.4 million (on an unlevered basis, if we exclude interest payments, that figure stands closer to -$80 million):Figure 4. 2U FCF trendsSource: 2U Q4 earnings deckThis implies two things. First, 2U barely has two years of liquidity left on its balance sheet. Its options for capital raising are likely limited. With negative profits and existing debt on its books, raising additional debt capital is unlikely to be an option. And with shares at less than a third of where they were trading in 2019 and with sour market appetite toward unprofitable companies, 2U isn't likely to be able to raise a secondary equity offering either.Second, 2U's firepower for additional acquisitions is limited. In 2019, 2U generated aplenty of inorganic revenue growth through its purchase of Trilogy - but it paid $388 million in cash for total acquisitions in 2019. It doesn't have sufficient resources to pull this off again in 2020 unless it raises additional capital. Once the prior-year comp for Trilogy normalizes, 2U will revert to mid-teens revenue growth. 2U gives us no reasons to be bullish on this company. Yes, it's true that the online education market is huge (2U estimates it at $30 billion). But just because the market opportunity is massive doesn't mean that 2U is capable of executing to capture a meaningful share of it. With enrollment trends continuing to wane and cash balances looking quite strapped, I'm content to stay on the sidelines here."

(TWOU) was due for a bounce. The company's valuation had dropped to a point where its revenue multiple compared quite favorably to other companies in the education sector. Apparently management agreed with my assessment that TWOU is cheap as an open market buying spree led by five insiders has fueled a 24% rebound in the stock since that time. The amount of total shares purchased and the fact that there has been five participants in such a short period of time gives me added confidence that my long thesis on TWOU is correct. I believe there is a good possibility that more insiders will buy shares as the stock price rebounds closer to my target price of the high teens to $20 in the near future. Data by YChartsThe following insider buys have taken place in August between four board members and one member of management:The total dollars invested between these five insiders came to $3.3 million in the span of a week. A total of 233,277 were purchased, representing about 0.4% of TWOU's shares outstanding. This is substantial buying and investors should keep an eye out for additional insider transactions as a bullish near-term catalyst.Why have these insiders bought shares? Perhaps they are merely averaging down, believing that there was an overreaction to the updated outlook provided on the Q2 2019 conference call. Perhaps they have added insight into the business that suggests now is a great time to load up as shares will not get any cheaper than this once the company successfully executes on its pivot. However, investors must be aware that heavy insider buying is no ironclad guarantee that the company will be successful; insiders have been wrong to buy and hold shares on TWOU so far. Instead of blindly following insiders into a position based on their buying, it is prudent for investors to do their own analysis. I have attempted to do that by comparing revenue multiples of various peers to TWOU.A popular argument of bears on TWOU is that due to its high cost of acquisition and lack of scalability, the company has a business model resembling more like a for-profit college than a technology company. While TWOU still has time to try to prove this bearish thesis wrong, I compared 2U's enterprise value to trailing 12-month revenue to several publicly traded companies in the for-profit education sector in my previous article. Those included Grand Canyon Education, Inc. (LOPE), Strategic Education, Inc. (STRA), Laureate Education, Inc. (LAUR), American Public Education, Inc. (APEI) and Career Education Corporation (CECO). Here is an update to that chart since TWOU has bounced: Source: Yahoo Finance based on closing prices on August 16, 2019TWOU sits comfortably in the middle of the pack with a 2.2x EV/Revenue multiple. I believe that it has room to move an additional 20% to $20 with an EV/Revenue of 2.6x before bears can once again say that it is overvalued when looking at for-profit school public listings. I think it is reasonable to maintain my short term bounce target of the high teens to $20 on TWOU and reassess my position if and when it does get to that price."
4308943,104952,2019-11-25T07:35:14-05:00,"2U's (TWOU) shares were down ~58% to ~$13.56 after Q2 earnings due to reduced full-year revenue expectation driven by shortcomings in enrollment.The current headwind appears to be temporary and isolated. In Q3, we see how 2U bounced back with a 44% revenue growth.The company’s zero-interest deferred tuition program will serve as a near to medium-term catalyst.","2U (TWOU) was founded in 2008 as a company providing software solutions to colleges and universities to manage their online degree and short course programs. 2U works with 35 university clients, which include the University of Southern California, the University of North Carolina, and Georgetown University. 2U shares were down by ~58% to ~$13.56 after its Q2 earnings call, where the CEO reduced the full-year revenue expectation across all the businesses due to the difficulties in attracting student enrollments.Despite the moderate revenue outlook, we are inclined to take a bullish position on the stock. In our opinion, the current headwind on the enrollment side of the business appears to be temporary and isolated. Our thesis hinges on the fact that 2U operates in a very interesting online education market with a massive secular long-term growth opportunity. The company’s recent guidance-beating performance in Q3 has boosted our confidence that the company is back on the right track in taking advantage of such macro opportunity. In particular, we point out the company’s initiative of zero-interest deferred tuition program to combat the low enrollment to be the major near to medium-term catalyst for the stock.The key macro growth driver of 2U’s core business is the growing global demand for online programs at the top-tier colleges and institutions mostly in English-speaking countries. In Q3, we see how 2U achieved a 44% revenue growth to provide a clear line of sight to its $570 million - $575 million full-year outlook for FY 2019. Overall, we notice that the Alternative Credential segment drove the growth with a 192% revenue increase YoY to $50.4 million.(source: 2U’s Q3 earnings call slide)On the execution side, 2U needs to activate its three key growth levers to boost growth. So far, the challenge has seemed to be the slowdown on student enrollment in the Graduate Program segment. When we look further into 2U’s key metrics, which is revenue per-FCE (Full Course Equivalent), we found the major culprit in the slowdown to be the lower demand in higher-valued Graduate Programs.(source: 2U’s Q3 earnings call slide)Despite the increasing number of courses on both segments and increasing revenue per-FCE trend on the Alternative Credentials, which mostly involves shorter-term courses, the Graduate Program’s revenue per-FCE has been in decline since last year. All these seem to indicate a gap between the students’ financial capacity to enroll and the number of Graduate Programs available. In September 2019, the company launched its pilot scholarship program offering a zero-interest deferred tuition payment to further boost enrollment to tackle the issue. The progress on this part was encouraging as well despite its early stage, as the CEO indicated in the Q3 earnings call:In the near to medium term, we expect that the continuation of strong scholarship program traction to drive overall growth. In the long term, however, we foresee a lot of massive untapped opportunities across Graduate and Alternative segments in store for 2U. The demand for STEM skill sets, for instance, is something that will not taper off for quite some time. In fact, STEM demand has driven the growth of the Alternative Credentials segment as of Q3.As of FY 2018, 2U has been driving over ~45% of its Graduate Program revenue from a concentrated client base, which we believe is a major risk factor. Graduate Program, as of 2018, made up over ~83% of the company’s total revenue.(source: company’s 10-K)On an equally important note, we also notice that the company had reduced this dependency well in the last two years. As the company launched its scholarship program to boost further adoptions of more courses across more institutions, we believe that it will be able to diversify further in Q4 and beyond.On the valuation front, we believe that 2U is quite underpriced. Its TTM P/S of 2.59 offers investors an interesting buying opportunity in stock with ~37% YoY revenue growth and a solid ~73% gross margin. Another online education player such as Instructure, Inc (INST), for instance, trades at 7.82 TTM P/S despite its weaker growth and profitability outlook than 2U. Instructure is in the LMS (Learning Management System), which is a different business than 2U’s. However, we consider two companies to be in the same online education enabler space. We believe that the discount in 2U valuation reflects its temporary headwind in recent times. Considering strong executions in the next few quarters, we expect the company to trade at a higher premium in between its own and Instructure TTM P/S, which is 2.59 - 7.82. The midpoint range of 5.2 and the expected FY 2020 revenue of $729.39 million will further set the stock to trade at our target price of ~$59 per share by the end of 2020."

Some will have covered but any remaining short covering could help with a bounce but won't be the main driver.TWOU's revenue multiple compares favorably to industry peers whether one believes those peers are SAAS companies or for-profit colleges.My bounce target on TWOU is the upper $10s to $20 for a short-term trade.","2U, Inc. (TWOU) cratered last week after announcing its Q2 2019 results. While revenue topped expectations, a disappointing outlook and mounting losses caused a slew of analyst downgrades. It looks like the bubble has burst on the company's unprofitable business model, and while the CEO tried to spin it as positively as possible, the market was not receptive to the explanations. Its heavy burn rate left unchecked could leave the company out of money as early as the start of 2021. However, now that 2U has dropped to less than a $1 billion valuation and is suffering from the status of being a former Wall Street darling, it may be time for contrarian investors to try to catch this falling knife.Data by YChartsThe cratering stock price can be attributed to CEO Chip Paucek tempering expectations in the near term in order to react to a shifting market dynamic and ensure longer-term profitability. Simply put, I believe that the company was blindsided by disappointing enrollments in some of its programs and will be cutting back on the number of offerings (presumably the least profitable ones) to try to streamline its operations and improve its margins in 2020 and beyond.While painful in the short term, I give credit to management of TWOU for coming clean in admitting it needs to change its business model while it still has enough cash in the till to do something to right the ship. There are no shortage of examples of companies that avoided making painful short-term decisions in order to prop up the stock price for as long as possible before driving headfirst into a brick wall. 2U is not one of those companies. When I put my contrarian investor hat on and try to look for the good in so much bad, this is a point that stands out as good.One of the main reasons for buying a beat up stock like TWOU is the hope of a short squeeze during the ""dead cat bounce"" phase of its chart. The theory behind this is simple. As essentially all shorts have average prices at well over $30 and most at well over $50, they are already deep in the money. If you were short from $50 to $14, you already made the bulk of the money you are going to make. There is no point in keeping open a position where your maximum gain is $14 and would have to take years of continuous mismanagement to see it. It's better to close the position and redeploy that margin power elsewhere on another short (or long) target.Shorts in at $50 will be less likely to see a huge difference in covering at $12 versus $17. What they need is volume to close out the position in an orderly fashion. As of July 15, short interest was 12.2 million shares, or just under 20% of the stock's float. The entire float has churned in the three trading days since releasing financials, so there is a good chance that a lot of the shorts have covered. The possibility of a short squeeze remains, though it is not as high as it would be with other stocks that have seen this type of drop. There needs to be some fundamental reason to support catching this falling knife beyond hopes of a short squeeze.The main short thesis on TWOU is that due to its high cost of acquisition and lack of scalability, it has a business model more aligned to a for-profit college than a technology company. This was a brilliant and correct forward-looking thesis from several months ago. However, the market has now caught onto this and no longer values 2U as a high-growth, scalable SAAS company worthy of a 10x or greater revenue multiple. Over the past 11 months, TWOU has dropped from a high of a 13 revenue multiple to less than 2:Data by YCharts2U is actually trading rather cheaply when compared to several companies in the for-profit education field. Below is a chart comparing enterprise value to trailing 12-month revenue of 2U to Grand Canyon Education, Inc. (LOPE), Strategic Education, Inc. (STRA), Laureate Education, Inc. (LAUR), American Public Education, Inc. (APEI) and Career Education Corporation (CECO).Source: Yahoo Finance based on closing prices on August 2, 2019Other than APEI, which is a clear leader in this metric, 2U is either on par or valued more cheaply than the rest of the field. The claim that 2U is a for-profit college and not a SAAS company is an obsolete argument at these low prices because it compares reasonably favorably to the for-profit colleges and will now compare highly favorably to SAAS companies. Granted, a lot of these companies are profitable while 2U is still burning through cash at a rapid rate. But these comparable companies also don't have the claim of being a disruptor in the education industry, which 2U may still be even despite the struggling business model and pivot due to market dynamics that is causing so much short-term pain.Based on the oversold nature of the stock, the incentive for remaining shorts to cover and a revenue multiple that compares well to peers, no matter what type of companies are considered its peers, I expect 2U to bounce to the upper teens to $20 in the near term. Anything beyond that, and the short thesis of 2U being an overvalued education company may be relevant once again and a good exit point. For now, I will continue to hold a small, speculative position in 2U which I will monitor closely for possible addition, trade or exit."

Through its 2UOS operating system, 2U provides a platform for higher education institutions to provide content to students. Recent acquisition of Trilogy has also allowed 2U to offer diverse offerings in short courses and boot camps for working professionals. While Q2 results show signs of increasing digital adoption, the question whether universities need 2U's platform to offer digital education remains to be seen. Our valuation using ~5.2 TEV/Sales shows minimal upside, thus we recommend a hold rating for the stock.Since Q2'20 earnings release on 7/30/2020, TWOU went up ~7.3%. Below is a summary of their quarterly results:Source: 2U 2Q20 ResultsRevenue grew 35% YoY to $182.7 million, beating expectations by $7.47 million. 2U operates in two segments, Graduate Program Segment and Alternative Credentials Segment. Graduate Program provides online delivery programs for graduate students, while Alternative Credential provides short-courses and boot camps for working professionals. In the revenue breakdown, Graduate Program went up 14% y/y to $115.7 million, while Alternative Credentials rose 97% y/y to $67.0 million primarily because of revenue inclusion of Trilogy's acquisition.Operating income as a percentage of revenue was -27%, up by a 6-point margin y/y. This increase is driven by margin improvements in both Graduate Program and Alternative Credential. Graduate Segment margin increased to 4.1% (48% y/y) while Alternative Credential margin rose to -10.1% (50% y/y). If you look closely into 2U's operating expenses, a decrease in marketing sales, 54% of revenue (-16% y/y), is what drove the margin improvement. However, other operating expenses such as technology development and general and administrative expenses stay flat at around 20% and 22%, respectively. Therefore, 2U must make further improvements in operating expenses by cutting general and administrative expenses to achieve a positive operating income.Source: 2U 2Q20 Results2U's adjusted EBITDA of -$2.1 million (85% y/y) has put the company closer to positive free cash flow by the end of 2020. Rising demand of online degree programs and short courses has allowed 2U to use its scalable platform to increase revenues while keeping operating expenses relatively constant.Source: 2U 2Q20 Earnings PresentationIn addition, a worsening economy has caused more people to develop their education online to broaden their skill set in a competitive workspace. Therefore, we expect enrollments to increase in the second half of 2020 per CEO Chip Paucek's 2Q20 earnings call:Source: Author2U has also introduced undergraduate programs starting Fall 2020. Undergraduate programs tend to cost lower than graduate programs, hence we expect average revenue per enrollment for Graduation Program Segment to decrease. Alternative Credential Segment is enjoying an upward momentum thanks to the recent acquisition of Trilogy, an education technology company specializing in providing tech boot camps.According to HolonIQ, public-private partnerships (PPP) between universities and private education companies are expected to increase $8B from 2020 to reach $15B by 2025, an increase of over 50%. With a superior platform and partnerships with prestigious universities, 2U is poised to be one of the biggest players in the PPP education market.Source: 2U 2Q20 Earnings PresentationDuring the spring semester 2020, we saw universities using Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) to deliver online lectures to students. While ZM does the job well with features such as a breakout room and a screen recording tool, 2UOS has a more comprehensive platform that emulates a better experience of a physical lecture. And if you're a college student paying hefty tuition fees, you would want a better value for your money.Source: 2U CEO during 2Q20 Earnings CallWith COVID-19 looming in Fall 2020, universities have to adapt by shifting digitally to deliver content. Going fully online takes huge expenses and not every university has the means to do that. 2U's value proposition is then to help universities' digital transformation by using its platform to attract students and develop courses. Let 2U focus on marketing and product development, while universities solely focus on content. However, different operational approaches between 2U and universities can cause a culture clash. 2U deploys data-driven marketing strategies using various social media and artificial intelligence to target prospective students. Conversely, traditional schools still use brochures and mailers for advertising.You can also argue that universities might see 2U as a threat because students are now getting most of their content online instead of attending a physical program on campus. Although 2U can help attract the right students using their targeted marketing, universities will then have to share some of their revenue with 2U. Alternatively, universities can refuse to play ball and develop their own platform without necessarily having the prowess to be competitive.2U is currently trading at 4.54 TEV/Sales, while John Wiley & Sons. Inc. (JW.A), its closest competitor in the US, is trading at 1.5 EV/Sales. In the last year, 2U to JW.A EV/Sales ratio ranges from 1.50 to 4.46. Assuming a 2U/JW.A ratio of 3.5 and current JW.A ratio of 1.50, we estimate an implied 2U EV/Sales ratio to be 5.2, yielding an implied fair value of $52.7, a 12% upside. Therefore, we think the stock is a hold and we recommend a better entry point for investors."

        Operating costs continue to rise in support of new degree programs, causing cash burn to widen.","At long last, the 2U (TWOU) bubble is starting to show cracks. The self-labeled education technology company (I prefer to think of 2U as a for-profit education company), after a string of bad quarterly releases and decelerating revenue growth, has shed more than 20% of its market value year-to-date, as well as hanging substantially below the $75 peak point that the stock reached in mid-February. At the end of last year, when 2U shares were trading north of $50, I warned that there was a far bigger bearish case for 2U than bullish, driven by two primary factors:With 2U's Q4 and Q1 results released in 2019, we can start to see some of these headwinds working against 2U - especially after 2U's May release of its Q1 results, after which 2U shares hit year-to-date lows. Despite the sharp fall in 2U shares, investors should continue to avoid this stock. This is a company with precious little IP, a cost-heavy business model that continues to show declining margins, and is at the mercy of flagship universities continuing their partnership agreements with 2U. Let's first address the steep deceleration that 2U has seen over the past two quarters, which is the biggest driver on investors' minds. Take a look at the company's quarterly revenue trends in the chart below:Figure 1. 2U revenue trendsSource: 2U Q1 investor deckAs seen in the chart below, 2U's growth has decelerated to 32.8% y/y and 32.4% y/y in Q4 and Q1, respectively. Though Q1 revenues of $122.2 million were more or less in-line with Wall Street's expectations of $121.8 million (+31.9% y/y), this growth rate represents quite a marked decline from the 40-50% y/y growth rates that 2U was experiencing last year.There are several reasons underpinning that. 2U activated a bunch of its degree programs last year relative to the prior year (14 new programs vs. 10 in the prior year, up 40% y/y), while at the same time ramping up its ""alternative credential"" programs, contributing to a lot of last year's nominal growth rates. This year, program rollouts have occurred at a more measured pace (17 new programs vs. 14 last year, or only +22% y/y), while 2U is now lapping against the first year of the alternative program launch. The chart below shows the timing of its program rollouts:Figure 2. 2U program rollout calendarSource: 2U Q1 investor deckAt the same time, even though full course equivalent enrollments (FCEs) hit an all-time high of 39.5k in Q1 driven by the new program launches, the revenue per FCE hit an all-time low of $2,637 this quarter: perhaps suggesting that 2U is skewing toward less-lucrative programs:Figure 3. 2U enrollment and revenue trendsSource: 2U Q1 investor deckAs a result, 2U's growth trajectory has been perceived as quite weak. In addition, 2U's forward guidance implies that the deceleration pattern hasn't yet bottomed. 2U has pegged Q2 revenues at just $124.3-$125.0 million, representing a growth range of +27.6% to +28.3% y/y, signaling four or more points of further deceleration:Figure 4. 2U guidanceSource: 2U Q1 investor deckTypically as technology companies mature and see slowing growth rates, investors expect to see scale-driven margin improvements and positive cash flows. 2U, however, has had a massive explosion in costs, further dispelling its associations with being a bona fide technology company.Here's a look at 2U's full Q1 financials:Figure 5. 2U Q1 financialsSource: 2U Q1 earnings releaseHere's how 2U's major expense components have shifted:Each of these spend components have increased at or greater than the pace of revenue growth. I'll reiterate here that 2U's business model calls for it to bear all the costs of attracting students as well as setting up the technology platform and paying for the content behind each of its new course programs. Judging from the fact that expenses are rising faster than costs, we can safely say that 2U's business model isn't quite bulletproof even as the company scales to a ~$500 million annual revenue run rate. GAAP operating margins sank to -20.0%, down 270bps from -17.3% in the year-ago quarter.At the same time, 2U is rapidly burning through its liquidity. As seen in the chart below, 2U burned through -$32.5 million in operating cash flows while spending -$3.2 million on capex, totaling -$35.7 million in free cash flow losses. That's a 73% y/y jump in cash flow losses, compared to -$20.6 million in 1Q18. Figure 6. 2U cash burnSource: 2U Q1 earnings releaseWith only $424 million of cash left as of the end of Q1, 2U may run out of liquidity and have to tap the capital markets anytime within the next 1-2 years - a dangerous proposition as its stock has fallen to YTD lows. It's not difficult to see why investors have abandoned 2U shares en masse this year. Results have drastically fallen behind on both the revenue and cost fronts, and trends are headed the wrong way: even as revenue growth slows dramatically, 2U's costs continue to explode and consume its dwindling cash balances.Despite the ~20% year-to-date drop in shares, 2U is not a ""buy the dip"" situation. Continue to avoid this name and invest elsewhere."

This is the second earnings pullback in a row for 2U, a stock that had plenty of investor confidence earlier in the year. Despite tremendous top-line growth, investors are now beginning to question the scalability of 2U's model and whether it's worth the premium that it trades at.TWOU data by YChartsOf course, 2U isn't the only growth stock that has been pummeled in the month of October. Investors have retreated from richly valued names en masse over the past few weeks, rotating into more value-oriented names and cash flow generators. But growth isn't enough anymore to guarantee stock price performance.2U's growth, after all, is what I have long considered to be relatively low-quality growth. Looking just at the company's ~50% y/y top line growth rate yields a very favorable image of this stock, but the scalability of that growth is very different from other technology companies. Whereas a software or internet company can make an incremental sale by selling the exact same product to a different customer (thereby incurring very little incremental cost for the next sale), 2U cannot. It grows by expanding into new degree programs and new universities, each of which requires custom programming and marketing investment to enroll new students. 2U bears the brunt of this cost upfront. And though these programs can last multiple years and bear fruit over time, the unit economics and ease of rollout for 2U is very different from most other technology companies.Yet 2U, at a forward revenue multiple of ~8x, is essentially being valued like a high-growth software stock - despite its lack of easy scalability. Even after falling more than 45% from May highs, 2U is still highly overvalued. 2U's valuation is only now beginning to catch up to its business reality. To be fair to 2U, the company is making slight progress on operating margins and EBITDA. Losses are slimming down (though slowly), while EBITDA margins are creeping upward. The long time to value for 2U, however - from program inception to profitability - is still very extended, making it a very risky stock to invest in. This is especially true as the company's guidance for Q4 came in lower than expected:Figure 1. 2U 4Q18 guidanceSource: 2U investor relationsWall Street had pinned a revenue target of $114.9 million for 4Q18, slightly higher than the midpoint of 2U's range of $114.4-$114.3 million. In addition, 2U also released preliminary guidance for FY19 that forecasts 32.5%-33.9% growth for the full year. That's a steep drop from the >50% growth rate that 2U experienced this quarter. What we have here is a company with rapidly decelerating growth and questionable long-term margins - it's not worth a premium valuation, and it never was. Continue to avoid 2U.Here's a look at 2U's results in the third quarter:Figure 2. 2U 3Q18 resultsSource: 2U investor relationsRevenues grew 52% y/y to $106.9 million, barely edging out over Wall Street's expectations of $106.4 million (+51% y/y). This also represents two points of acceleration over last quarter's 50% y/y growth. Note however that, relative to prior quarters, this beat margin is a bit too close for comfort - in Q2, 2U had beat Wall Street's expectations on the top line by a three-point spread. 2U's growth is driven largely by an increase in the number of full course equivalent enrollments, or what the company calls FCEs. This quarter, FCEs grew 36% y/y to 32,665, as shown in the chart below:Figure 3. 2U FCE trendsSource: 2U investor relationsNote that 2U's average revenue per FCE has stayed roughly flat at ~$2,700, which means it's already squeezing as much revenue per student as it can. Continued growth relies upon 2U's ability to create new programs and maximize enrollment in each - after all, there is no space constraint on digital classrooms.The biggest issue here is that most of 2U's largest components of operating expenses shoot up alongside growth. Marketing and sales expenses, for example, increased 47% y/y to $60.5 million, consuming a massive 56.6% of revenues, only a slight increase in efficiency from 58.8% in the year-ago quarter. Recall that most of 2U's contracts with universities stipulates that 2U bears the cost of setting up the program as well as advertising for enrollees, despite having to split the tuition fees with the host university. You'll note as well that 2U also begun taking on curriculum costs, which jumped about 5x from virtually nothing in the year-ago period to $6.4 million this quarter.Luckily, 2U captured some efficiencies in general and administrative costs, and to a lesser degree, technology and content costs. As a result, 2U was able to improve its operating margin to -11.1%, better than -22.4% in the year-ago period. The company also managed to turn a small EBITDA loss in 3Q17 into a small EBITDA profit this quarter:Figure 4. 2U EBITDA Source: 2U investor relationsThe company's pro forma EPS of -$0.01 also barely edged out over Wall Street's consensus expectation of -$0.02.Still, until 2U manages to get a firmer grip on its exploding marketing costs, it's difficult to be bullish on this firm's profitability potential. Many of 2U's programs (into which it has dumped large, upfront fixed investments) are still relatively new, so we won't be able to judge these programs' ROI for awhile. In my view, 2U's ability to scale into a profit generator that throws off cash flow is still unclear.While 2U's profitability improved modestly this quarter, year-to-date the company's losses have still swelled from -$29.9 million to -$43.2 million, on a GAAP basis. Though 2U certainly has enough liquidity to fund its losses, we have to be rather judgmental on a company that is on track to hit a half-billion dollar revenue run rate next year but is still producing sizable losses. 2U's dramatic fall from its peak prices accurately price a company that is expected to decelerate, as well as one that has yet to prove the sustainability of its business model. Rebound investors have plenty of beaten-down growth stocks to choose from, but 2U remains a clear avoid."
4313548,103480,2019-12-20T11:46:52-05:00,"Shares of 2U contain plenty of risk, despite a recent Q3 earnings beat and an upbeat FY21 revenue outlook.Organic growth has slipped to the teens, while enrollment trends in 2U's core programs continue to disappoint.At the same time, profitability continues to erode. Adjusted EBITDA slipped negative this quarter, despite a profit in the same quarter last year.2U's true colors as a high-cost, low-scalability business continue to shine through with each passing quarter.","Looking back at the stock market in 2019, one of the most salient shifts in market sentiment that happened over the course of the year is the fact that tech investors have gotten incredibly picky with individual stocks and business models. Ever since the WeWork (WORK) IPO ended in a spectacular flameout for a once-hot unicorn, investors have peeled back growth companies' business models and abandoned those companies that have little hope of scaling to profitability.Sitting squarely in this group is 2U (TWOU), a stock that was popular last year for claiming to revolutionize graduate education, but has since been revealed this year as little more than a for-profit university that, by the way, doesn't make much in the way of profits.The big reckoning for 2U came at the end of last quarter, when enrollment trends started slipping (especially revenue per enrolled student). Shares of 2U immediately sliced off more than half of their value. Now, shares have rebounded ~2x from their all-time lows near $12, but in my view, the fundamental business has only gotten worse. Organic revenue growth has slowed down even further, enrollment trends are worse than last quarter, and profit margins continue to slide.Don't be complacent with 2U's most recent phantom rally: as we'll discuss shortly in 2U's most recent results, the fundamentals for this company are actually getting worse. 2U is far from the ""buy the dip"" or recovery play - steer clear of this stock and invest elsewhere.2U's strategy for growth is simple: launch as many degree programs at as many universities as possible, and attract as many students to those programs as possible. 2U bears the brunt of the setup costs of these programs - it has to pay to develop the content, the technology, and the marketing for these programs, while the university essentially offers its credentialing stamp. This effectively means that 2U's investments in its degree programs only pay off in the long run if enrollment spikes and covers the initial outlays.Unfortunately, the reverse is true at the moment. 2U's enrollment statistics have never looked weaker, as shown in the chart below:Figure 1. 2U enrollment trendsSource: 2U Q3 earnings deck2U's enrollment growth continued to decline in Q3, decelerating three points from +28% y/y growth in Q2 to just 25% y/y growth this quarter. Graduate program revenue per full-course enrollee, meanwhile, showed its worst-ever quarter in Q3: down -8% y/y and representing a steep five-point deceleration from -3% y/y in the most recent quarter. 2U's core graduate degree programs make up two-thirds of its revenue, so this is a highly concerning trend. Student retention could be part of the problem. 2U's CEO noted that retention in the grad division stood at 82%. For 2U to scale its programs to profitability, it needs a plan to retain these students (for whom 2U is responsible for advertising to).2U's CFO, Paul Lilljie, also noted on the Q3 earnings call that some of 2U's larger and older degree programs are running into scale issues:This weakness caused 2U's organic revenue growth to decelerate ten points quarter-over-quarter to 17% y/y, down from 27% y/y in the prior quarter. Though 2U's nominal top-line growth accelerated sequentially, the only catalyst supporting that growth is 2U's recent acquisition of several ""alternative credential"" programs. Core grad program revenues, meanwhile, fell from 25% y/y in Q2 to just 15% y/y this quarter.Figure 2. 2U revenue trendsSource: 2U Q3 earnings deckIt's unclear why 2U shares have marched materially higher versus last quarter: these simple enrollment and revenue metrics showcase a business that is progressively decaying.At the same time as revenue/enrollment trends are disappointing, 2U's profitability isn't improving either. Profitability has been a huge focus for technology investors this year, with many high-flying growth stocks experiencing painful multiples contraction because their bottom lines couldn't keep up.2U is one of the companies most guilty of margin degradation - the company's ""growth"" doesn't seem to be taking it anywhere closer to profitability. In fact, this quarter, adjusted EBITDA (2U's primary measure of profits; and especially apt this quarter as it adjusts for a current-quarter acquisition impairment charge) decayed to a loss of -$10.7 million (-7.0% margin) versus a profit of $4.7 million (+4.4% margin), representing a margin decay of eleven points. Figure 3. 2U adj. EBITDA trendsSource: 2U Q3 earnings release2U's business model originally promised that while grad degree programs are expensive to set up, they would eventually become profitable as the program becomes more established and more students sign up. This thesis isn't proving true: as time passes and 2U's oldest grad programs age, enrollment is trending downward while losses continue to mount.To be fair, 2U has recognized that it needs to cut fat out of the company, and recently embarked on a restructuring. Per the CFO's comments, the company expects to shave $11-$12 million of cost savings annually once the restructuring takes full impact:Until we see margins begin to improve, however, rational investors have to ask what the good is in investing in a company that is seeing both its top and bottom lines weaken.My view on 2U remains unchanged: this is a for-profit university masquerading as a tech disruptor, whose actual popularity in the market is waning as evidenced by decelerating enrollment trends. At the same time, 2U is burning through gobs of cash to set up degree programs that have low retention potential and may not be profitable in the long run. Stay on the sidelines here as 2U continues to lag behind the broader market in terms of both fundamental performance and stock price moves."

Source: VentureDeal Venture Capital DatabaseAccording to a market research report by Technavio, the global IT training market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 6.2% between 2014 and 2019.The main drivers for this expected growth are due to a large number of institutions providing informal and social learning platforms to teach IT.2U disclosed the acquisition price and terms as follows and via a form 8-K filing:Management said it would not be providing financial guidance as a result of the transaction until it closes, likely within 60 days from the announcement date of April 8, 2019.A review of the firm's most recent 10-K filing indicates that as of December 31, 2018, TWOU had $475 million in cash and investments and $102.4 million in total liabilities.Free cash flow for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, was a negative ($15.1 million).In the past 12 months, TWOU's stock price has dropped (21%) vs. the S&P 500 Index' rise of 7.3%, as the chart below indicates:Source: Sentieo2U has a history of beating consensus estimates since Q2 2016, as the chart shows below:Source: Seeking AlphaAnalyst ratings are mostly either 'Buy' or 'Outperform', and the consensus price target of $88.25 implies a potential upside of 34.3% from the stock's price at press time of $65.71:Source: Seeking AlphaAnalyst sentiment in earnings calls has remained relatively stable since early 2017:Source: Sentieo2U is acquiring Trilogy for its university partnerships and enterprise training and 'boot camp' capabilities.As 2U CEO Chip Paucek stated in the deal announcement,Management's investor presentation is an excellent resource for information on the strategic rationales for the deal:However, since the deal announcement, investors have been unimpressed, lowering the stock by more than 8%, although analyst firm Piper Jaffray said the deal promises to add a 'competitive edge' and strengthen its university partnerships.With the acquisition, 2U is making a significant move to increase its technical education capabilities as businesses struggle to attract qualified workers across a range of technical competencies.2U is banking that Trilogy's focus on the boot camp format of fast-learning in specific technical areas can be a source of growth as businesses demand a more technical workforce.The strategic rationale is compelling, although we don't have visibility into the short-term financial effects of the deal on 2U's business.The firm has ample balance sheet capacity to acquire Trilogy, but investors will need to wait until management provides updated guidance after deal closing, projected within 60 days."
4279496,103480,2019-07-31T10:23:48-04:00,"Shares of 2U cratered more than 25% in after-hours trading after the company reported dismal Q2 results.
        Though 2U's revenues showed nominal acceleration over Q1 and beat Wall Street's estimates, most of the growth can be attributed to acquisitions.
        Meanwhile, enrollment in 2U's core grad programs showed its first-ever sequential decline.","Investors are no longer buying 2U's (TWOU) ""growth"" story. The self-labeled education technology company reported bleak Q2 results and shares tanked more than 25% in response, reinforcing my earlier thesis that 2U's losses would continue mounting. In addition to weaker growth in its core business, 2U also showed an alarming slip in profitability that may threaten its dwindling liquidity.The problems at 2U aren't difficult to pinpoint. At the heart of the issue is the fact that 2U faces a serious scalability problem. 2U grows primarily by adding new degree programs at new universities, and enlarging the pool of students in its target universe. Its agreement with most universities calls for 2U to bear much of the risk, as 2U is responsible for developing the course content as well as funding the costs of marketing the programs to new students.Therein lies a separate issue: each degree program at 2U is unique to a particular school and a particular field of study. This couldn't be any more distinct from a typical SaaS company - no matter what client Salesforce.com (CRM) is selling to, for example, its Sales Cloud product will be exactly the same (with the exception of a few industry-specific solutions that may come with some customized features). Salesforce does not need to create a new product or marketing plan each time it wants to sell to a new client - but 2U does. 2U invests substantial funding and effort upfront in the hopes of creating fully-enrolled, long-lasting degree programs at flagship universities. But when enrollments falter, its upfront costs start to look like poor investments. And that's what happened this quarter, when full course enrollments (FCEs) fell for the first time. In a nutshell - continue to avoid 2U. Despite shares having lost more than half of their value since the beginning of the year, 2U is not a value stock with a clear rebound catalyst in the near term. Its entire business model rests on shaky foundations, and as we've seen this quarter, its rapid and costly expansion into new degree programs doesn't always bear fruit. 2U's headline metrics this quarter actually didn't look too bad. 2U's revenues clocked in at $135.5 million (+39% y/y), beating Wall Street's expectations of $124.4 million (+28% y/y) and accelerating seven points over last quarter's 32% y/y growth rate, as shown in the chart below:Figure 1. 2U revenue trendsSource: 2U 2Q19 earnings deckWhen we look at the fine print, however, we learn that 2U's results include, for the very first time, the contributions from two recently acquired subsidiaries - Trilogy and GetSmarter, which drove a near doubling of 2U's alternative credential revenues on a sequential basis. 2U's underlying graduate degree program business, however - which accounts for approximately three-quarters of its business - saw its first-ever sequential decline in revenues, while the number of graduate degree programs saw its slowest y/y growth pace since 2Q18. Let's drill a bit deeper into 2U's core business on the next slide below:Figure 2. 2U grad program enrollment trendsSource: 2U 2Q19 earnings deckAs we can see in the chart above, similar to revenue, grad program FCEs also saw the first-ever sequential decline to 39,180 enrollees. At the same time, average revenues per full-course equivalent also continued a declining trend that began last quarter, hitting just $2,588 in Q2 - down -3% y/y and the worst performance over the past nine quarters.These are sobering results that clearly sap any excitement that 2U's acquisition-driven revenue acceleration might generate. 2U's grad programs are the bread-and-butter of its business, and the bedrock of the company since 2U launched its first program with the University of Southern California (USC) in 2009. We can deduce from these results that 2U's programs are seeing waning popularity and relevance among students, despite the fact that 2U has a presence on far more campuses now than in any prior period. Online degree programs, as a whole, aren't attracting enough cachet or respectability compared to traditional schooling to drive increased enrollment. We can also deduce, from 2U's declining average revenues per enrollee, that the company is either discounting course fees in order to attract more students or is increasing its exposure to lower-cost programs and universities.2U's declining enrollment takes its toll not only on growth rates, but on the company's bottom line as well. Despite lower FCEs, 2U's costs continue to balloon, as shown in the table below:Figure 3. 2U 2Q19 resultsSource: 2U earnings press releaseCurriculum and teaching costs more than doubled to $13.3 million; servicing and support costs rose 39% y/y to $24.0 million; technology and content development costs rose 71% y/y to $26.0 million, and sales/marketing costs ballooned 54% y/y to $89.8 million. Overall, 2U's GAAP operating losses more than doubled to -$46.0 million, representing an operating margin of -34.0% - which is more than ten percentage points worse than -22.5% in the year-ago period. Likewise, 2U's pro forma EPS of -$0.43 dramatically missed Wall Street's consensus estimate of -$0.35.These widening losses heavily impacted 2U's liquidity as well - year-to-date OCF of -$47.9 million represents more than double 1H18's OCF of -$20.2 million. And as illustrated in the chart below, Q2's operating cash flow burn plus the cash that 2U paid for Trilogy and GetSmarter caused a dramatic decline in 2U's cash balances:Figure 4. 2U cash bridgeSource: 2U 2Q19 earnings deckAt 2U's current burn rate, the company may be forced to raise dilutive capital within the next 1-2 years - and that excludes the impact of any acquisitions that 2U might make to bolster its declining growth rates.2U very much remains a troubled company, and its Q2 results show just how badly its flagship graduate program business is hurting. Declining enrollments are a new conundrum for 2U, and add further credence to the growing sentiment that the company's business model is not genuinely scalable. In spite of slowing enrollments, 2U's costs continue to balloon - which may put the company in a near-term liquidity crunch.Continue to avoid this stock at all costs and invest elsewhere."
4195508,103480,2018-08-06T19:13:59-04:00,"2U stumbled after posting Q2 earnings despite a beat to Wall Street expectations, the first earnings disappointment in many quarters.Similar to high-profile takedowns of the likes of Netflix, 2U's high valuation is finally catching up to it.The company's business model isn't as scalable as other tech companies, as it requires immense setup and content creation to onboard a new university.Shares still have further to fall, especially as 2U's losses continue to mount and expose its deteriorating margins.","I've been bearish on 2U (TWOU) for quite some time now, but until the company's recent Q2 earnings stumble, which sent shares down 6% despite a beat to top and bottom-line estimates, the company has only traded up. In my view, the company has begun to enter into a reversal phase that will dial back the company's extremely high valuation. Investors, in dumping shares of recent outperformers like Netflix (NFLX) and Twitter (TWTR), have shown a shift in preference toward more value-oriented names, and 2U is anything but.To 2U's credit, the company has done an incredible job of recruiting world-class universities and spinning up its narrative on a silver platter to Wall Street. The company's tagline of creating online course content for thousands of students has played well in investors' ears, particularly when blue-chip educational technology (""ed-tech"") companies are in short supply. The below snapshot, taken from 2U's August investor deck, showcases its collection of top-tier universities:Figure 1. 2U institutional partners (also customers)Source: 2U investor relationsBut behind the veil, the business model is actually very imperfect. As I've noted in a prior article, when 2U wants to set up a new graduate degree program (the focus of its offering is in grad-level, degree-granting courses), it bears the majority of the online content development and marketing costs to acquire students. It gets paid a share of tuition fees over subsequent years of the program's operation, but there's certainly no guarantee of a positive payback - in essence, 2U isn't too different from a for-profit university, albeit one with a strong technology angle. In selling off 2U's shares, investors are perhaps wising up to the fact that this kind of business isn't scalable, and it certainly isn't SaaS - though the backbone of 2U's offering lies in software, it's not the same one-size-fits-all software that a company like Salesforce (CRM) can serve up en masse to its clientele. Each program requires custom implementation work, and thus, 2U's long-term profit potential is severely curtailed. 2U is every bit a 'high-growth"" company. Revenue growth even accelerated this quarter to 50% y/y (we'll parse the company's Q2 results shortly), but investors didn't seem to care. In fact, the majority of earnings movements this quarter thus far have been in response to bottom-line metrics, such as Tesla's (TSLA) rally when it burned less cash than expected. Growth seems to be less important to investors at the moment, and 2U's lack of profitable growth is beginning to hurt it.2U is down more than 20% from its May peak, but with shares still persistently trading at 9.4x forward revenues, there's still plenty of room for 2U shares to fall for a company whose revenue stream is so widely unpredictable and low-margin. Ed-tech is a fine sector to invest in, but there are plenty better names to choose from. In particular, I've been long on Instructure (INST) for several quarters, a true ed-tech SaaS company that delivers course management software to universities as well as a corporate learnings platform for enterprises (and unlike 2U, Instructure's software can be delivered en masse, at negligible incremental costs for the next sale). Instructure recently took a ~20% beating after its revenue growth decelerated in Q2, but its <6x forward revenue multiple for a company that is growing at ~30% y/y and is a true scalable SaaS play makes it a far better pick than 2U.Here's a look at the company's most recent results:Figure 1. 2U second quarter earnings resultsSource: 2U investor relationsAt first glance, 2U posted what seemed to be yet another strong quarter. Revenues grew 50% y/y to $97.4 million, surpassing analyst expectations of $95.8 million (+47% y/y) by a respectable three points. Most notably, 2U also experienced eight points of sequential revenue acceleration, as Q1's growth rate had clocked in at just 42% y/y.But under the hood, there are potential problems brewing. Take a look at the company's enrollment trends, as depicted in the company's Q2 earnings presentation:Figure 2. 2U enrollment trendsSource: 2U investor relations2U's business model depends on attracting the maximum number of students to its courses - after all, it spends a considerable amount of development and marketing dollars to set up its graduate programs, and as there are no physical classroom or enrollment constraints on these programs, 2U maximizes its earnings by maximizing enrollment. Yet this quarter, 2U only added only 778 full course equivalents, far less than the 2,688 net adds in Q1 and 3,020 net adds in Q4. Some of this can be attributed to seasonality. On a year-over-year basis, 2U still grew FCEs by 28% y/y. But with FCE growth lagging behind revenue growth and seeming to slow down, it casts doubt on 2U's ability to keep growing at its current fast pace.Complicating matters is the fact that average revenues per FCE, as illustrated by the pink line above, have been falling since 4Q17. If average revenues per enrollee are declining at the same time that enrollments themselves are decelerating, 2U's return on investment in its degree programs will start looking a lot worse.Further illustrating how resource-intensive 2U's business is, the company had to boost marketing and sales expenses by 57% y/y to $58.4 million in the quarter, a faster pace of growth than either FCE growth or revenue growth. As a percentage of revenues, marketing costs consumed 60.0% of revenues (more than some of the most aggressive SaaS companies, I would add), 280bps higher than 57.2% in the year-ago quarter. General ad administrative expenses also shot up 61% y/y, while new expenses for ""curriculum and teaching"" costs, which didn't exist in the year-ago quarter, added another $6.0 million of costs. Overall, 2U's operating losses more than doubled to -$22.0 million , while operating margins worsened dramatically to -22.5%, 590bps worse than -16.6% in the year-ago quarter. As 2U gets bigger, its operations are becoming even less efficient - further substantiating evidence that the company's business model is unscalable. Operating cash flow losses, on the other hand, also nearly tripled to -$20.2 million, much worse than -$8.1 million in the year-ago quarter. 2U is still sufficiently capitalized, with $488.8 million of cash on its books, for us to begin worrying about liquidity concerns - but it seems unlikely that the company can turn around its operations to hit profitability anytime soon. In my view, 2U's business model is finally being laid bare to the investing public, as the company losses mount at a faster pace than its revenue growth. 2U's explosion of costs in the second quarter struck a sensitive nerve and exposed the thesis that, in the long run, continued growth may even put 2U into ruin. If this company has to undertake the costs for both curriculum preparation as well as advertising its courses, in return for declining average tuition fees and a slowdown in enrollment growth, 2U might not be the change-the-world ed-tech company that investors originally thought it to be. Yet despite the fall from recent highs, 2U still has much more to lose. Its high valuation leaves it susceptible for further selloffs. In my view, investors are best staying on the sidelines for this experimental name."
4170584,103480,2018-05-07T06:13:58-04:00,"2U is racing back toward all-time highs on the back of a minor Q1 earnings beat and guidance raise.The company barely beat Wall Street's estimates, and top-line growth slowed down to 42% from 51% last year.2U's business model remains extremely consultative and low-margin, very different from the SaaS model that typically characterizes richly valued technology companies.This point is illustrated by the fact that 2U's rapid growth in the quarter has actually deteriorated its margins rather than improve them.","Investors' optimism for 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU), the for-profit online education company, continues to soar. Rallying on Q1 earnings beats, 2U's stock jumped more than 6% in a bid to reclaim its all-time highs. I've been bearish on this company for quite some time, and in the face of continued gains in 2U shares, I have even more conviction that the correction will happen soon and sharply:TWOU data by YCharts2U's post-Q1 rally has been rather bizarre. Investors have been doggedly unreceptive of earnings this quarter, with even strong beats by companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) being met by harrowing sell-offs. The near double-digit gains that 2U saw post-earnings have been almost unheard of this quarter.2U's earnings, which we'll discuss next, weren't quite that impressive either. Results beat Wall Street expectations by just a hair (as per usual - 2U has always eked out tiny earnings beats, never surprising too much to the upside), and growth showed a noticeable deceleration from last quarter.And beyond the near-term results, there's also the question of 2U's entire business model. Is it sustainable? The company faces immense start-up costs in launching new programs at new universities, developing and digitizing the university's course material while also sharing in the marketing costs of acquiring new students. 2U takes a share of tuition fees, but unless the program is immensely successful and full over a number of years, 2U won't be able to recoup its costs - and even if it does, the margins are nothing near those of typical SaaS software developers. I've previously asserted that 2U is really more of a for-profit education company (a blighted industry in the public markets) that has been extremely successful at posing as a technology play instead.The valuation clearly shows it. Including 2U's gains after reporting Q1 results, the company has a market cap and enterprise value of $4.5 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, putting the company's valuation at 10.7x EV/FTM revenues, as shown in the price chart above. For a high-growth technology or internet company with high margin potential (gross margins in the 70-80% range can translate to huge operating margins at scale - just look at mature tech companies' income statements for proof), a double-digit multiple would already be stretching valuation limits. But for 2U, which spends nearly every penny of its revenues toward acquiring students and producing course content, the stock's valuation is beyond reason.Making matters worse, 2U's profitability metrics have showed deterioration this quarter - also unlike a typical tech company, which may be loss-leading in its early phases, but generally shows improving margins every year. This calls into question 2U's entire model - does it ever have a path to profitability when its business is so cost-intensive?Despite the positive response from the markets thus far, I believe 2U is in a precarious position. The company is not ""transforming the classroom,"" as some bulls would believe (real SaaS companies like Instructure (INST) and the still-private Blackboard are better picks on that theme), but rather creating custom-built online courses on a one-to-one consultative basis. The model is hardly scalable, and I foresee the rally stalling in the near-term horizon.Here's a look at 2U's first-quarter results:Figure 1. 2U Q1 earningsSource: 2U investor relationsLike many other questionable companies, 2U has benefited from investors focusing on the more positive aspects of the quarter, while ignoring some distasteful metrics. Revenues in the quarter grew 42% y/y to $92.3 million. Yes, that's a great growth rate, but for a company trading at nearly 11x forward revenues, a ~40% growth rate is more or less expected. 2U also only beat Wall Street's expectations of $91.4 million (+41% y/y) by such a small margin that it's really more accurate to call this quarter in line than a bona fide beat.What's more, 2U's growth is actually a steep deceleration from the 51% y/y growth rate the company experienced in Q4. Of course, ~50% growth is impossible to sustain forever, but is a nine-point sequential deceleration in a single quarter an appropriate catalyst to send shares up by 6% post-earnings?2U attributed its $8 million beat to its guidance to the following:The company also signed a comprehensive deal with Baylor University encompassing three new graduate programs to launch through the end of 2019.But despite the top-line performance, do we really have much to be excited about in this quarter? As previously mentioned, I believe 2U's business model is much less scaleable than a typical technology company, whose platform applies to any client and can be onboarded without incurring too much additional cost. 2U faces enormous setup costs with every single client it takes on, so its revenue performance takes a backseat in importance to its profit metrics, in my opinion.And in that regard, 2U's scorecard is much less rosy. Tech companies (which 2U likes to compare itself to) tend to show greater cost discipline as they scale, balancing growth alongside reasonable margin improvement, but in 2U's case it's the opposite. Marketing costs (which are used to acquire students in 2U's programs) jumped 53% y/y/ to $53.1 million in the quarter. Corporate overhead rose 60% y/y to $21.9 million in the quarter. And the total of course development costs and a new expense category called ""curriculum and teaching"" reached $19.5 million, up nearly double from last year.In aggregate, 2U generated a GAAP operating income of -$16.1 million in the quarter, nearly 5x last year's losses and representing an operating margin of -17%. This is much worse than the -6% that 2U saw in 1Q18. So yes, 2U is growing, but at what cost? It seems like the company can't grow without digging itself into a deeper and deeper hole on the profitability front.2U bulls defend their position by saying that once a certain program has been operational for a few years, 2U can begin to generate profits from sustaining programs. There is some basis of truth in this assertion, but it's not the full picture. 2U doesn't have to re-create course content (aside from perhaps the occasional update), but most degree programs last only 1-2 years - meaning that high marketing costs won't improve. And that's 2U's largest expense category. To generate the kind of growth rate that 2U investors have been used to over the past several years, 2U has to keep dumping more and more investment into advertising for students.Even 2U's adjusted EBITDA, a company-customized profitability metric, went from a profit in the year-ago period to a loss in Q1:Figure 2. 2U adjusted EBITDASource: 2U investor relationsWith costs rising faster than revenues and with a questionable path to profitability, it's unclear why investors have placed so much faith in 2U.Perhaps the one department at 2U that deserves props is the investor relations team, for communicating a bullish narrative so effectively to investors and to Wall Street. A closer examination of 2U's rising costs and its very business model, however, doesn't yield such a rosy assessment.2U's growth is more or less tethered to high enrollment numbers in its various programs - which, in turn, requires huge amounts of sales and marketing costs. Unlike SaaS companies, whose installed customers can theoretically remain put for years or decades (incurring very little incremental sales costs in the following years), 2U's students leave every 1-2 years, requiring a fresh batch of fee-payers every single cycle. This, on top of growing content costs, is the main reason 2U's growth looks hugely unsustainable.At the rich valuation 2U is trading at, the company is priced for perfection. The risk-reward profile is heavily tilted against bulls for this company."

That's essentially what 2U (NASDAQ: TWOU) is, though the company has made every effort to steer customers and investors away from that stark categorization. 2U, admittedly, has been masterful at controlling its own narrative to the stock market, a paragon of superb marketing that other companies could truly learn from. Instead of inviting comparisons to, say, the University of Phoenix (whose commercials for online programs plaster the radio), 2U has steered its narrative instead to transforming the classroom with modern technology tools and creating a learning environment where there is ""no back row"" for any student - its major tagline.All this is true. 2U does have strong proprietary technology and reviews for its digitized course material are strong. The company has attracted a top roster of Tier 1 universities to digitize a lot of critical masters' programs - including Berkeley, Yale, Northwestern, and others. But all this doesn't change the fact that at the heart of its business is a for-profit, fee-sharing model with the program tuition from these universities.See the company's list of university partners below, taken from a recent investor presentation:Figure 1. 2U partner universitiesSource: 2U investor relationsPerhaps because of brand names within these partnerships, and with little regard to substance of the partnership agreements, 2U has dazzled investors over the past year. In the last twelve months, shares have rocketed more than 2x, reaching an all-time high of $90 after posting this quarter's results.TWOU data by YChartsAs I've written in a prior article (when 2U's price was in the mere low $50s), 2U has become an overhyped company and should be avoided. The results from this quarter and the run-up in the stock over the past few months don't change that assessment.There's no doubt that 2U has built a strong, lasting foundation, with long-term partnerships across the roughly two dozen universities that have signed up to offer online programs through 2U's platform. But is the model truly scalable?In order to grow, 2U must add new university programs to its roster. Its growth comes from the growth in tuition that 2U derives from enrolled students. But unlike a typical internet company whose growth can be generated more or less organically as traffic volumes increase, 2U must actively chase growth. While universities are contributing the course material and content (it's their degree program, after all), 2U must transform this material into digital content on its own dime. The result is an extremely expensive contract for 2U, with enormous set-up costs for every new program. 2U is also responsible for bearing the costs of marketing these programs and driving enrollment. It's really betting on these programs to be a long-term, multiyear source of enrollments and tuition fees to justify the heavy upfront costs.Such a risky model doesn't invalidate 2U's business, but it should invite a lower valuation due to the lower margins. Instead, 2U's valuation is rather bloated. At its current share price of $88, 2U has a market cap of $4.59 billion. Netting out $223.4 million of cash on its balance sheet, 2U's enterprise value is still a staggering $4.36 billion.We can judge this valuation against the guidance 2U has given for FY18:Source: 2U investor relations2U's enterprise value represents a 10.8x EV/FY18 revenue multiple and a 270.0x EV/FY18 EBITDA multiple, based on the guidance midpoints of $400.2 million and $16.2 million in revenue and EBITDA, respectively. No matter how good 2U's business is, it's not worth that much.2U has seen robust revenue growth over the past few quarters, as shown in the chart below:Figure 2. 2U revenue growthSource: 2U investor relationsIn the fourth quarter, 2U posted revenues of $86.7 million, up 51% y/y and slightly beating Wall Street's expectations of $85.0 million (+48% y/y).The Street's focus on top-line growth, however, ignores that fact that 2U's growth is very expensive to buy - as new programs involve large development and marketing costs, as previously discussed. In the fourth quarter, 2U has only barely managed to break even in its operating margin, as shown below:Figure 3. 2U operating costsSource: 2U investor relationsThe rise in sales and marketing costs, plus the added technology, content, and curriculum costs, have essentially eaten up all the growth in 2U's revenues. At the very least, 2U's operating margin this quarter is breakeven and not -4% like in 4Q16.A typical technology company is valued at such high multiples of revenue because as growth takes off, costs usually don't scale proportionally. A SaaS application, for example, can host new customers for little incremental cost. 2U, on the other hand, must continually develop new content and pay to advertise on behalf of these programs.The one good piece of news is that, on an adjusted EBITDA basis, 2U appears to be showing some progress:Source: 2U investor relationsFor the full year FY17, 2U has managed to nearly triple its adjusted EBITDA to $11.4 million, a 4% margin on full-year revenues of $286.8 million. As discussed in the preceding section, however, 2U's EBITDA barely supports its huge valuation. The company is guiding to 42% y/y EBITDA growth in FY18, but even based on that EBITDA figure, the forward-looking EV multiple of 270x EBITDA is absurd.None of this is to say that there is no bullish case for 2U. If the company does indeed manage to retain its top degree programs for 10-15 years and continuously drive enrollment growth across its portfolio, the contribution margins from its tuition share will begin to bear fruit and justify the heavy start-up costs from launching and marketing new programs. At this point, 2U would generate rich margins and cash flow.But this is a long-term scenario that has plenty of execution risk along the way. There's no guarantee that 2U can retain its programs for that long or drive enough enrollment to pay down its costs. The company's sky-high valuation essentially prices in flawless execution and leaves no room for error - making the stock extremely susceptible for a correction if investors should catch any whiff of a slip-up.As 2U rockets toward $100/share, traders will be itching to take profits on the trade. In my view, 2U's stock has a near-term ceiling on its price - be wary of investing at this juncture."

We conservatively assume that the number of program launches over the medium term is in line with company guidance.Relevant CompsABCO, CVG, ATHN, TDOCCatalystSummary:We recommend shorting shares of 2U, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWOU). 2U shares have roughly tripled since its March 2014 IPO, garnering a $2.1 billion valuation and 11x revenue multiple by positioning itself to investors as an industry-leading SaaS growth story. Our variant view - supported by discussions with 2U customers, former employees of 2U’s competitors, and industry experts - is that investors are significantly overestimating the quality of 2U’s business model and overlooking the increasingly competitive nature of its industry. With the company priced to perfection and several near and medium-term catalysts that should highlight the company’s tenuous competitive position and overly-optimistic estimates, we believe 2U is an actionable and timely short with an attractive risk-reward.Company Description:2U is an Online Program Manager (OPM) and is the only publicly traded company in its industry. 2U partners with universities to create online equivalents of their on-campus degree programs. It funds the startup and most of the operating costs associated with developing and running these programs. In exchange, it receives a share of university’s tuition revenue (currently 60-65% take-rates). The OPM is responsible for marketing and student recruitment, as well as providing the technology platform for the programs. The university handles the academic aspects of the program and is responsible for admissions decisions. The company typically signs 10-year contracts and has been free cash flow negative since its founding in 2008.Investment Thesis:Investors Significantly Overlooking Impact of Increased CompetitionWhile analysts tout 2U as an industry leader and largely ignore competitors in their analyses, in reality, 2U competes with multiple other OPMs, several of which are larger or similar in size to 2U. Our conversations with those in charge of online programs at several 2U customers as well as with former employees of major OPMs indicate that the industry has become much more competitive and that there is little that differentiates one OPM from another. Additionally, despite 2U labeling itself as a technology company, our conversations also suggest that 2U’s technology is not substantially different from that of peers.In addition, 2U also faces disintermediation risk from universities themselves, which can run online programs in-house.Indeed, several major 2U customers have recently launched online programs that are run in-house (i.e. without any OPM) or by 2U’s competitors. Since signing its first contracts with 2U in 2009, the University of Southern California (2U’s largest customer which comprised 34% of the company’s revenue in 2016) has launched online MBA and Masters of Engineering programs that are run in-house and partnered with Embanet, one of the largest five OPMs, to launch its online Masters of Public Administration. Other examples of 2U customers running new programs without 2U include Georgetown for its Masters in Finance program and George Washington for its online MBA. Based on our discussions with university administrators, switching costs, while not non-existent, are relatively minor.The impact of this intense competition has already begun to manifest in 2U’s operating results. Benchmarking 2U’s revenue against OPM industry revenue estimated by Eduventures, a research and advisory firm specializing in higher education that conducted a deep dive on the OPM industry, reveals that while 2U grew its market share from 8.3% to 13.2% between 2011 and 2013, its market share has since stagnated, growing only 50bps between 2013 and 2015. Interestingly, no sell-side research references Eduventures’ industry estimates.However, despite the company’s stagnating market share and issues related to intensifying competition revealed through our primary research, sell-side analysts have accepted management guidance for 30% yearly revenue growth going forward (similar to the company’s revenue growth over the past few years) at face value. This compares to Eduventures’ estimate for an 18% industry CAGR through 2019 and implies that 2U’s market share will grow from 13.7% currently to 22.7% by 2019.Furthermore, increased competition will pressure not only the company’s ability to grow market share but also its pricing power. While the earliest contracts that 2U formed had the company receiving 60-65% of tuition revenue, our conversations with industry participants suggest that these high take-rates are at risk on new and renewal contracts.In fact, we believe that this dynamic is best articulated by none other than the founder and former CEO of 2U, John Katzman:Not surprisingly, when 2U renegotiated its contracts for USC’s Education and Social Work programs (which collectively comprise the bulk of the company’s 34% revenue from USC and generate outsized margins), its revenue take-rate was reduced (these reductions will take place three annual increments starting in 2017). Moreover, these reductions in take-rate are entirely decremental to profit flow-through, devastating contract economics. We estimate that the reduction in revenue share on the USC contracts represents a ~26% increase in operating loss and ~210bps reduction in operating margins on a consolidated basis. Furthermore, several of 2U’s other major contracts will be coming up for renegotiation over the next year. Given that the bull case for 2U is predicated on significant margin expansion, the risk of future price reductions on renewed contracts is particularly meaningful. Growth Strategy Has Not Translated To Economic Value CreationNot only are there risks related to ambitious revenue estimates and the potential for pricing contraction, but we also believe 2U’s recent revenue growth, which has been the major driver of the stock’s performance since its IPO, has not translated to meaningful economic value creation.While 2U’s earliest contracts came with attractive economics, we believe that 2U has failed to replicate this early success. Even after nearly 10 years of operating, 2U still generates the majority of its revenue from four of its earliest programs. We believe that these early programs were largely successful because they were in verticals with broad appeal and high tuition such as business, nursing, and education, and were formed when online education was in its infancy. However, 2U has exclusivity agreements with customers that limit its ability to launch new programs in existing verticals (i.e. if 2U supports one university’s online MBA program, it is often unable to support another university’s online MBA program). Because of this, 2U has increasingly relied on programs in smaller, niche verticals such as Speech Pathology, Library and Information Science, Mental Health Counseling, and Health Informatics to drive growth. As a result, the company’s average enrollment per program has declined from 1,583 in 2012 to 797 in 2016 (a -15.8% CAGR).As a result of lower enrollments (and thus lower revenue for 2U), these recent programs have inferior economics. 2U must spend a fixed $5-10mm in upfront expenditure for all programs, regardless of size. Moreover, because there is a smaller population of potential students interested in programs such as Speech Pathology and Library Science, 2U’s per-student marketing expenditure is further burdened for these programs. Our DCF analysis suggests that such programs contribute only $7mm in NPV (or 0.2% of the company’s market cap) on average to 2U, even assuming the low end of the $5-10mm range for upfront expenditure and assuming that the contract is renewed indefinitely and with no change in take-rates upon renewal (i.e. assigning the contract a full terminal value).We estimate that the company’s current and announced contracts are worth $500mm, implying that the market is valuing future contracts at ~$1.5bn. Based on our analysis of the economics of recent contracts, 2U would need to have over 200 contracts outside of its core programs simply to justify its current valuation (vs. 37 running and announced programs currently). Essentially, in order to believe 2U is fairly valued, investors must believe that the economics of new programs will closely match that of its successful early contracts and that 2U will grow its number of programs at a significantly faster rate than it has over the past several years, both assumptions that are unlikely given the increasingly competitive nature of the OPM industry, pricing pressure from universities, and the inferior economics of new programs.Aggressive Valuation Driven By Erroneous Comparisons to SaaS Companies2U describes itself to investors as a “leading provider of cloud-based software-as-a-service, or SaaS, technology and technology-enabled services.” Sell-side analysts have bought into this view and assign 2U multiples commensurate with SaaS companies in determining their price targets. As a result, despite the aforementioned issues, 2U trades at a rich 10.1x trailing revenue multiple. Notably, this is a substantial premium to the 5.0x and 4.1x revenue multiples that Embanet and Deltak (two of the largest five OPMs along with 2U) were acquired at, despite there being little structural difference between 2U and these companies.Underpinning these comparisons is the belief that 2U’s business model, like those of SaaS companies, is highly scalable and that the company will thus realize significant operating leverage as it grows. Investors and analysts believe that 2U will be able to achieve software-like margins (management's long-term guidance calls for EBITDA margins of 30%+).However, these comparisons to SaaS companies and the market’s belief that 2U will achieve software-like margins belie the fact that 2U’s primary service is actually lead generation operated through call centers. Our discussion with university administrators confirmed that universities consider marketing and student recruitment to be the most important service that OPMs provide and that the technology platform is a secondary concern. Consistent with this, the vast majority of 2U’s expenses go toward student recruitment and marketing. Student recruitment costs represent 47% of the company’s total expenses. By comparison, technology and content development actually represents the smallest expense category for 2U, comprising only 14.7% of expenses.Furthermore, based on our conversations with university and administrators and former OPM employees, 2U’s student recruitment services largely consist of operating call centers. As highlighted in a Forbes article examining the OPM industry, over 50% of the employees working at Academic Partnerships, one of the largest five OPMs, work in a call center. While researching the company, we filled out online forms requesting information for several of online programs supported by 2U. Following this, we received calls and emails from 2U employees acting as admissions counselors for these programs on a nearly daily basis. Examining Glassdoor reviews for the company further confirms that 2U’s marketing function is little more than a call center.Essentially, 2U’s marketing model is little different from that of the for-profit universities, whose largest expenses are marketing/student recruitment and which utilize similar marketing strategies. While this is not a problem in and of itself, for-profit universities’ histories demonstrate that there is little operating leverage inherent to this model. As the statistics below indicate, for-profit universities saw little or even negative operating leverage even as their revenue increased substantially.Simply put, 2U’s business model is labor intensive and requires a scaled up employee base as volumes grow. If 2U wants to enroll 100 more students, it must make a proportional number of additional calls, which in turn requires a proportional increase in headcount in its marketing staff. In addition, 2U’s marketing expense is further burdened by the rigorous admission standards of the universities it supports and by the fact that the company’s growth must come from increasingly niche programs with smaller populations of interested students. It’s also worth noting that there is also little operating leverage with respect to technology and content development, as content and software must be customized for each client.Consistent with the findings of our research, industry analysts don’t regard 2U or its OPM peers as technology companies. Tyton Partners, an investment bank and strategy consulting firm focused on the education industry, refers to OPMs’ business model as “business process outsourcing,” not as a software or technology company.Given the labor-intensive nature of 2U’s business model, the commoditized nature of OPMs’ product offerings, the high level of competition in the industry, and universities’ ability to run programs in-house, we believe that 2U is structurally a much lower margin business than the software companies that analysts and management liken it to.Valuation:We value 2U by applying a DCF to each of 2U’s current and announced programs, as well as estimated future new programs. Our valuation also incorporates the present value of tax savings from the company’s NOLs. Our base-case assumes that the company’s existing programs see a 4.0% reduction in take-rates (and a commensurate decrease in operating margins) upon renewal. We also assume that that the company’s new programs have peak enrollment of 650 students, 57.5% tuition take-rates, and 15% terminal operating margins (vs. the company’s average margin of 17% on programs three years or older, an average which includes the company’s largest and most profitable contracts). We conservatively assume that the number of program launches over the medium term is in line with company guidance. Our base-case price target is $22, implying 48% downside from current levels. Crucially, we view risk-reward as highly attractive, as in order to justify a valuation close to the company’s current market cap, investors must assume no degradation in economics on renewed programs and that new programs will be larger than and have superior economics to the company’s average existing programs, all as the company meets management’s optimistic guidance for the number of new program launches. In a downside case, in which the company’s economics are pressured further than in our base case, our price target is ~$16, implying over 60% downside.(Editors' Note: This is a republication of an entry in the Sohn Investment Idea Contest.

4145633,90055,2018-02-12T09:59:31-05:00,"2U is an interesting story in higher education that is gaining momentum in the adoption of its platform.Revenue growth looks promising but earnings growth leaves unanswered questions.2U's CEO looks like a strong leader, and might be able to lead his team towards earnings growth, making this a worthwhile investment.","Imagine you worked for a university and were tasked with increasing enrollment. Where would you start? You may come up with the idea of taking existing courses at the university and offering a distance learning opportunity. But you would likely have a couple of concerns with this approach. First, (assuming you worked at a reputable university) you wouldn't want to risk the university's reputation for excellence with a lesser quality education in a distance learning program. Secondly, you'd want a system that gave the prospective students a high chance of success. But even if you figured these two things out, you'd still have to work out the actual nuts and bolts of the program, something which you may not be trained to do.2U (TWOU) exists to solve the problem we've just glanced at. The higher education industry is one that needs to evolve. The Internet has disrupted so much already especially in the areas of retail, payments, and television. But up to this point higher education remains one of the few industries not completely flipped on its head. But that's changing faster than most realize.Now, online education has existed for quite some time, but 2U is really coming at this in an exciting way that truly gives the whole idea credibility. To understand the investment prospects, we need to understand 2U's business model, the overall opportunity, and the company's timeline. Once we've established those things, we can begin to project five years down the road.With any business evaluation we need to know who the customer is, and what the product is. For 2U, while a university is technically the partner, it might be helpful to think of it as the customer. After all, the business rises and falls on how successful 2U is with initiating and retaining these university partnerships.While it's true that 2U has a few different products, the bulk of its business is centered around developing domestic graduate programs (DGP's in 2U's press releases) for these partner universities. For that reason, I'm really only going to be looking at this aspect of the business.2U partners with an individual university to develop an individual online domestic graduate program. On its end, the university gets increased enrollment, and increased revenue as a result. 2U takes care of developing the online materials, hosting said materials on its servers, recruiting and advertising the program, and coordinating real world experience opportunities. In return, 2U gets a cut of the university's revenue for each participating student.As should be expected, these domestic graduate programs are fairly costly to get off the ground. It takes an average of just over 3 years to become profitable on an EBITDA basis. Yet, 2U signs contracts with its partners for 10 years. Between years 4-10, each program averages an EBITDA margin of 36%.The year 2U went public (2014), it launched just 4 new domestic graduate programs. New launches are heating up as the company launched 13 new domestic graduate programs in 2017 alone, with about 30 planned in the next two years.Arguably, the hardest part of 2U's business is the adoption of its service. Convincing traditional universities that an online education can be just as good as being physically located on campus is a challenge. But once you silence the doubters, adoption becomes a lot easier. And I believe 2U is currently breaking through. Evidence of that belief is found in one of 2U's newest partners: Yale. Yes, I said Yale.2U partnered with Yale to launch a physician associate domestic graduate program. This program just kicked off. The challenge here was two-fold. Recruiting a school as prestigious as Yale is quite a step. 2U had to prove that this remote education could be every bit as good as being on campus at an Ivy League school. But also challenging was to develop a program in the medical field, that still provides students with access to a convenient network of real life experience opportunities.Having cleared this hurdle, is there really any university out there that could have doubts of what 2U is capable of? I highly doubt it. To date, the company has only partnered with 23 universities. That's a very small number. For perspective, division 1 of the NCAA has 351 member schools. And that's not to mention any of the major universities around the world. Now that Yale is on board with 2U, any number of these universities could be looking to partner with 2U in the future.The demand is clearly there. Originally 2U had planned 12 new domestic graduate programs for 2018. Last year it upped the plan to 13. Now it believes it will launch 14 programs this year. The pipeline is full of concrete plans, not baseless hopes.Yet while demand is high, 2U remains disciplined in selecting which domestic graduate programs to launch. Each career path is called a ""vertical"", and 2U currently has programs in 23 verticals. These verticals are carefully selected based on future jobs projections. In other words, 2U is offering courses for careers that will be in high demand going forward. For example, the company cites growth projections of 34% through 2024 in the physical therapy field.In summary, this is a multi-layered growth story. The company is growing the number of schools it is partnering with, growing in annual domestic graduate program launches, and launching programs in fields where student demand will continue to grow as well.Also important, while it is helpful to think of the universities as 2U's customers, it's also important to look at prospective students since 2U is responsible for all the marketing costs in recruiting these students. Here 2U shines as well boasting an 83% student retention rate. This is significant when compared to the national average for students on campus of a university.The stats show that nearly half of students drop out of college by year six. So far, 2U looks like it is doing well with retaining 83%. Though, this isn't an apples to apples comparison. These are the stats after six years, while 2U's stats will naturally be tilted towards more recent enrollments which would have a lower dropout rate. Yet as the chart shows, only 70% of college students are still enrolled after one year. So no matter how you slice it, 2U is doing well in improving student success rate, which bodes well for the future.As I researched 2U, it really seemed like this is a large boulder beginning to roll downhill. It takes it a little while to get rolling, but once it starts, momentum is hard to stop.As noted, the cost to launch a domestic graduate program is high -- generally just more than three years to become profitable on an EBITDA basis. That means that there is a high bar of entry for new competitors in this space. In a way that gives 2U a small ""moat"".But we also noted that the programs become very profitable at year four, averaging a 36% margin. So for six years, these programs maintain that profitability. This enables valuable cash flow to launch more domestic graduate programs. This timetable can't be overlooked. There were four programs launched in 2014 that are just coming into this top profitability tier. This profit margin coincides perfectly with a 67% increase in domestic graduate program launches between 2016-2017. Past investments are fueling today's growth. Likewise, these investments now will fuel the planned growth 3 years from now.I like to look at investments five years out, using what tangible data I can, and also using reasonable assumptions (not overly bullish or bearish).Here I've including a chart to help us estimate future revenue by a past revenue statistic.*Full year 2017 data isn't out yet.Here we see, that over the past four full years of data, the average annual recurring revenue per domestic graduate program is $8.6 million.As we project future cumulative domestic graduate program totals, we need to exclude the any programs before 2013, as those contracts would be expiring five years from now. Through 2020, there are 79 total programs in progress.*Hypothetical numbers. Company has not released projections beyond 2020.Given the previous two charts, if these numbers are even in the ballpark, 2U will easily be over $1 billion in annual recurring revenue five years from now.Consider that the market is currently valuing 2U at 14 times TTM revenue. That's sounds extremely high. But even if this valuation fell by 50%, this would still be more than a $7 billion market cap five years from now. The market cap sits at $3.6 billion today -- meaning this would still basically be a double with valuation falling by half.In the 2016 annual report, 2U provided a breakdown of average EBITDA margin by how many years since a domestic graduate program launch.Taking our launch numbers from before we can estimate what that would look like five years from now.*The actual mix is impossible to predict.This is a problem. EBITDA loss looks like it would be accelerating five years from now.But does the EBITDA picture get better if we look at it over the life of the contract (10 years)? If we zero in on just one domestic graduate program, what would it make over its lifetime? For simplicity, let's keep assuming $8.6 million annual recurring revenue.The implication of these numbers is that a domestic graduate program would lose money over the course of its life -- even if just barely -- if revenue per domestic graduate program stays the same. And maybe you're already noting (and rightly so) that up until now we have only looked at EBITDA earnings and not traditional GAAP earnings. That's significant since things like interest and depreciation are real expenses and can't just be ignored completely by investors.For 2018, 2U is projecting a net loss of around 11%. This is fairly inline with the last few years. But what would five years of double digit losses do to this company?2U currently has around $200 million in cash on hand and no long term debt. That's a very strong position to be in, but theoretically unless margins improve soon, the company would be low on cash after three years.Simply put, something has to change for this to be a worthwhile investment. And I'd say 2U would agree with that statement. The company believes that each domestic graduate program can achieve $16 million annual revenue. It also believes that it can have 200 programs at maturity.If you give the company the benefit of the doubt, this could be promising. It's very likely that 2U will be over halfway to its goal of 200 domestic graduate programs five years from now. If that's true, what if we assumed the company would also be halfway towards its goal of $16 million in annual recurring revenue per program, using the $8.6 million it makes today as a starting point? That would mean over $12 million in annual recurring revenue per program.Since the cost of launching a program is fixed, this revenue would largely go straight to the bottom line. With a projected 126 domestic graduate programs five years from now, that revenue increase would be around $450 million annually. Just a moment ago we noted that if revenue stays the same per DGP, EBITDA earnings would be -$374 million, and net income could be -$119 million. Yet, if 2U makes significant progress on its strategy, the revenue gains could more than wipe these losses out.Another key metric with margins is the cost of marketing the domestic graduate programs. This cost falls squarely on 2U, and accounts for over half of the company's expenses. The cost has steadily fallen over the years, and 2U believes it will only get better with improved analytics and efficiency gained by launching multiple programs in one vertical.The projected overall revenue growth we looked at is significant and can't be discounted completely. But earnings are also important, and there are some red flags here. Investing in this company today is betting 2U can deliver higher revenue and better margins on its domestic graduate programs down the road. In fairness, 2U's domestic graduate program growth targets seem much more certain than its plan for better revenue per program and improved margins. One would have to bet that the company could do what it hasn't done so far.A good CEO isn't a factor that makes or breaks an investment by itself, but obviously I prefer a good CEO in my investments. Of course, evaluating such a thing is somewhat subjective. We typically can only rate a good CEO with any degree of certainty in hindsight. So while I've never met 2U founder and CEO Christopher Paucek, and there's a lot of subjectivity to this process, he does seem to do a couple of things that great CEO's do.First, from the earnings calls, I noted that he (seemingly) cares for his employees. Two quotes that stood out to me from the third quarter 2017 call:With one employee he knows her favorite color. With another he takes a moment to congratulate her on a personal milestone. Neither was necessary. Neither was relevant in the least. But both indicate a real relationship exists between owner and his team.Second, he's a story teller. The way he kicked off his first quarter 2017 earnings call struck me:At the risk of boring you, as a linguist, I find his verb tense choices fascinating. He goes with the present tense here with ""believes"". We linguists sometimes refer to this as the ""historical present"". Stated as a present event, even though it clearly occurred in the past. This nifty little discourse tool has the effect of drawing a listener into the story.The fact that he starts off in storytelling mode at all -- on a conference call! -- is significant to me. As author Paul Smith points out in his book Lead With A Story, many iconic CEO's over the years have used storytelling to their advantage to inspire and lead their companies.Again, trying to rate a CEO is tricky business. But Glassdoor.com would also back up the hypothesis that Christopher Paucek is an able man at the helm of 2U. He currently enjoys a 93% approval rating, better than Jeff Bezos of Amazon (AMZN) and Reed Hastings of Netflix (NFLX), both of which are regarded as two of the better CEO's in the country.A good CEO can be the wildcard in 2U delivering on its hopes for better financials per domestic graduate program.In summary, I really like 2U the company. And I'm hopeful about the CEO. If Paucek can make headway on his promises of higher revenue per domestic graduate program and falling cost of marketing those programs, then earnings would begin to improve. It's possible earnings still won't be great five years from now, but if significant progress can be made then I find it likely the market will remain fixated on revenue growth. As we've seen, revenue growth should remain strong, so this could play out well. Because of these things, for now I'm classifying this as a high risk/high reward scenario. As such, I'll be giving this stock a small allocation in my Double Five Portfolio."

These RSUs will ‘vest over either a two or four year period following closing of the Acquisition.’GetSmarter’s 2016 revenue was $17 million, so 2U is paying a 7.7x Price/Sales multiple, which is not unreasonable given 2U’s belief in an acceleration of the business opportunity.2U expects the deal to be dilutive to net income per share in 2017, but did not say by how much.As of December 31, 2016, 2U reported cash and equivalents of $169 million, total liabilities of $49 million and generated $5.2 million in cash flow from operations, so appears to have enough cash on hand and ongoing cash flow to support the acquisition in the immediate term.Of some concern in 2016’s results is increased ‘Capitalized technology and content development cost expenditures’ of $16.7 million along with increased ‘Purchases of property and equipment’ of $7.7 million.These two uses of cash from investing activities resulted in a significant net decrease in cash for 2016, which when combined with the $103 million use of cash from the acquisition, will dramatically reduce cash on hand.Management did not indicate in its 8-K filing whether it would tap sources of cash from the issuance of debt or equity, although I suspect it will need to do so.Rationale and Commentary2U’s existing digital education offerings are primarily focused on U.S. domestic institutions providing courses as part of degree programs.As the company stated in its deal announcement,So, this deal is about expansion – geographic expansion and service offering expansion into non-degree learning for working professionals.2U is hoping to expand internationally, which can be costly and risky, requiring local managers who have the ability to drive new business while headquarters keeps a close watch on operational quality.The price to be paid isn’t cheap and 2U is using significant cash to do so, another risk of the deal.While the prospect of service offering and geographic expansion is tantalizing, this appears to be a risky deal for 2U.I write about M&A deals and IPOs.

3587046,29391,2015-10-20T18:29:54-04:00,"2U Inc. offers a hybrid online course platform for quality universities.However it's significantly overvalued, valued more like a tech company than an education company.It does have a future but I would look to be short until the price reaches a fair valuation.","In Part One of this series on the Future of Education I looked at two stocks that own notorious for-profit colleges (DeVry (DV) and Apollo (NASDAQ:APOL)). I also explained how alternatives such as like Udemy, Skillshare, Italki and Uncollege are offering superior outcomes for students, more quickly and more cheaply. Therefore I believe that those for-profit colleges are doomed.In Part Two here, I will talk about 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU), a company that has built an online course platform. It partners with top colleges to bring courses online. While it does have a future, I think it's overvalued.. Image source:USDAgov, Flickr, under a creative commons license)What does TWOU do?2U has partnered with top colleges like Berkeley and Yale to bring their courses online. It promises to bring together face-to-face classes, course content and ""real world experiences"" with their platform.This can be doubly profitable for both 2U and the universities themselves. Without the physical infrastructure costs of landscaping, classrooms and administration, these universities can deliver good courses at a lower cost, with lower overhead. And 2U can therefore charge highly for its platform (currently 60% of the course revenue).Students are spending as much as $97,500 on these online graduate programs and have seemingly been happy with the results.Together, this builds a very seductive picture for investors, but I'm not so convinced.The Financials of TWOUTWOU's current market cap is $1.1 billion. In Q1 2015 they reported quarterly revenue of $34.6 million and a loss of $5.5 million.On an annualized rate, the company is trading at approximately 8x revenue. On this valuation, it's comparable to the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and other fast-growing tech companies trading at large multiples of their sales.The only problem is the company isn't experiencing the significant growth that it had previously. Quarter-over-quarter between Q2 and Q1 2015, earnings grew just 1.7%.For all these reasons, shares have fallen 40% from $40 to approximately $24 at time of writing.How does TWOU compare to real courses, MOOCs, other alternatives to college?Compared to real ""in-person"" courses, MOOCS and other alternatives to college I think 2U's platform has a place. It combines the best of MOOC platforms with the ability to communicate with professors. Students can get real-time feedback.TWOU definitely has a future. Young people do need high quality education from good institutions and TWOU is well set to benefit from all investment in technology here.However these alternatives to college are much cheaper and offer better outcomes in a shorter period of time. Meanwhile the ""real-world"" courses offer all kinds of intangible benefits such as socializing, making real connections and positive experience on campus.Online courses offered through TWOU do have a place - there is a future for them. But I doubt it will ever be a huge chunk of the market.Why the valuation is too highTWOU has a tech company valuation. But I don't think we should put them in the same bracket as other tech companies.I don't think the era of people spending $97k on an online course is realistic, nor will it last. There will be competition in this space from all kinds of avenues.If TWOU wanted to be more innovative it could look to hire professors independently and launch its own online courses at a lower cost. It could create its own online college and accreditation systems. It could work with employers to build courses that people really want and need.It currently focuses on the ""elite university"" market. But it could probably charge just as much for an online trade school, e.g. plumbing or training electricians.Therefore it's worth a cautious shortAlthough I'm reasonably keen on the long-term thesis for TWOU, at its current valuation TWOU should be shorted.The stock has already fallen 40% in the last month. I believe TWOU has further to fall because I doubt TWOU will meet the high-growth expectations currently priced in, in the short term. It's a ""hot stock"" that's going cold.I think fair value for this stock is around $7-8 given its current trajectory and growth expectations.For the time being I'd look to short TWOU with a price target of around $14 for closing the position. Then if in a crash, it fell to around $4-6, I'd look to buy in again.Follow me for the next parts of The Future of Education series."
3570806,91945,2015-10-15T06:15:57-04:00,"2U has seen its share price decline rapidly in recent months.As the company's business model has been exposed to be more of an uphill battle than originally believed, investors have sold shares.Management has a lot of work cut out for it, which makes 2U an interesting short holding over the next year.","2U (NASDAQ:TWOU) is down nearly 40% in the last few weeks as the company's business model has been called into question. Investors are unsure whether 2U's model of earning revenue by the number of heads it brings in to its online programs is scalable due to the level of vetting required prior to each user's admittance. If 2U's potential market is severely limited by its ability to sign up new participants, further share price declines could ensue.The cloud software company has risen to prominence as online education became more of a viable option, with 2U's share price having risen nearly 200% over the last year, ending September. The company's appeal is its ability to use technology-based services that enable both non-profit colleges and universities to deliver quality degree programs online.For example, in March, 2U announced it was partnering with Yale University to offer an online Master of Medical Science degree for aspiring physician associates. The program essentially allows off-campus students the ability to earn a comparable degree to their on-campus counterparts, for less cost and geographical restrictions. The announcement sparked a strong rally higher in the company's share price.While 2U had been riding that wave of optimism, recent earnings reports have shown that the business model may have holes in it. The company is required to initially invest a lot in each new client prior to generating revenue. It must employ a full support staff for each individual online degree, then it must take on enrollment. 2U bears the burden of advertising and finding students to enroll in the program. While one might think this market is vast, 2U has chosen to partner with top-level universities. Its largest contracts are currently with the University of Southern California, Georgetown University, and Yale University.This presents a problem due to the rigid admission standards. And those students that do qualify are more likely to want to spend time on an actual campus. Not to mention, the turnover is high, with many either dropping out or graduating, leaving 2U with the responsibility of enrolling more.2U is not a bad idea, it simply presents more of an uphill battle than was previously realized by investors. Online education will definitely play a large role in the future of learning, but there are a few kinks that could hinder 2U's growth trajectory.For one, the company needs to embrace more than just top-flight universities. The average student doesn't attend Yale, or USC, and therefore should not be the target audience. This will increase the pool of users, and hopefully shore up issues with both revenue concentration, and turnover. Additionally, the way that contracts are currently set up with universities puts a lot of pressure on 2U, a speed-bump management needs to address.At current time, 2U doesn't have a solution to these issues, and has paid a steep price. The longer management keeps things the same, the more investors will feel uncomfortable about the company's long-term prospects. I recommend getting short the stock once prices have pulled back a bit due to glaring holes in the company's business model."
3975854,98236,2016-05-17T20:36:06-04:00,"2U shares are quite expensive and the company will not be either profitable or achieve significant cash flow in the near future.The company offers what appears to be a unique hybrid model primarily for graduate students that has major costs benefits for universities and students alike.There is a reasonable amount of push-back against this technology within the student bodies and the faculty at some universities.The company has signed up an impressive list of university partners and is rolling out new courses at a steady pace.The company has an 84% retention rate, perhaps unique in the online education space.","Perhaps a unique way to play the online education paradigm2U (NASDAQ:TWOU), a company that many readers will not have heard of has pioneered a unique space in which it helps some of the leading universities in this country develop online learning programs that allow the prestigious institutions to leverage their expertise and earn significant revenue. The jury is probably still out on whether 2U itself is going to earn lots of money. I think that it will, and so I recommend buying the shares. But it isn't planning on earning lots of money for a few years and that may deter some investors. I think the many critics of this company's model are using highly selective statistics that are more polemical than objective in order to reach their conclusions. Vitriol is really no substitute for objectivity and diminishes the credibility of the argument.Many of the critiques were written in the fall of 2015 and since that time, the share price trajectory has not worked out quite as anticipated. The company has had two quarters that substantially beat expectations and it brought forward its estimate of EBITDA profitability by a year. Overall, the company's shares made a top of $38/share in early August and fell steeply through the end of October and then recovered significantly before plunging again in this year's tech panic. The shares are now at about $27 up by 75% since their trough valuation at the bottom of the tech panic but down 29% since their peak. But the company has very high valuation and has yet to become profitable and so it is controversial, both as a business and as a potential investment.2U suggests that it is a SaaS vendor. It is not, and really the technology it has created is nothing like the on-demand software model. That is unfortunate in the sense that it hurts the credibility of the business model. This company does have lengthy agreements with its University clients. But in essence, this company helps its clients by outsourcing much of the hassle of creating an online learning experience. But it is silly and not terribly accurate to call what this company does a SaaS business model.I have argued elsewhere that SaaS models are potentially the most lucrative business models imaginable at scale for enterprise software companies. The economies of scale are here as well and they are visible in the numbers the last several quarters but this business will never generate the kind of profitability that real SaaS companies are likely to generate as they mature. Regardless of the 2-way or multiple way technology that 2U has developed, this is and will remain a relatively people-intensive business and one possible growth limit is simply recruiting the appropriate personnel who can achieve the company's objectives.And not to understate the obvious, the for-profit education sector has been a political football and the current administration has more or less attempted to suppress it by denying students loans for tuition at for-profit higher education enterprises. This company avoids that issue in a unique way as its clients are the universities and not students and it would be hard to find evidence that graduates of the institutions for which it develops online learning technology have a poor track record in helping their graduates to get jobs.There are a great many online learning programs offered by many universities these days. The current way of educating students is not a long-term business model. Tuition is already almost unaffordable for many households. The current model has not seen any material productivity gains in decades and it is unsustainable to continue to add scale to a process that loses money on marginal students and hope to make it up on volume.The current solution to the dilemma is for universities to open what are called massive open online courses (MOOCs). The problem with MOCCs is that they are not really effective and offer a degraded educational experience. In an MOCC paradigm, the students have little or no real-time interaction with professors and fellow students and are supposed to learn mostly on their own time. While MOCC programs generate thousands of degrees per year, the degrees that are granted usually have some kind of an asterisk and are not worth all that much in a competitive job environment. 2U is going to have issues in persuading students that the kind of degree that it offers is equivalent to a traditional degree. And the cost of what 2U offers is anything but a bargain. But I think the model that they offer is a sensible compromise between the MOCC experience and the incredible costs associated with a modern college education in this country.I think that everyone envisages a world in which a variety of IT solutions produce better educational outcomes for our kids than we have been able to achieve, more or less without technology. I am often appalled at what children don't learn in school these days that was considered normal half a century past. Gains in teacher productivity have been essentially nil for many years now, meaning that the cost of education (mainly RE taxes) has increased disproportionately and because so much of the tax burden for education is funded by property taxes, there have been boisterous arguments about whether the funding formulas unfairly disadvantage children living in poorer neighborhoods. Opposition to the Robin Hood laws passed in Texas to fund education more than 20 years ago were arguably the issue on which our 43rd president successfully ran for governor of the Lone Star state. 2U is only trying to solve a very little slice of that dilemmaSo far, investment in the online education space, politely put, has not worked out well for most investors. In fact, anything to do with for-profit education has been toxic with a combination of less than stellar business models coupled with harsh government opposition have driven many for-profit education companies into the ground. 2U - that is really the company's name - has developed a clever niche that just might work. Sadly, I am hardly the first analyst to come to that epiphany. Of the 10 analysts that cover the name, 5 analysts love it and the other 5 just like it. That is not my favorite set-up when I look at potential investments. On the other hand, 2U has a nice track record of beating estimates significantly and it did so again, earlier this month when it reported earnings for its first fiscal quarter that ended on 3/31/16.2U is a young company having been founded in 2008 and went public in March 2014 in an underwriting led by GS and Credit Suisse. The company's CEO is one of its founders Chip Paucek. Paucek, had previously been CEO of Smarterville, the parent company of Hooked on Phonics.I don't suppose it will come as a great surprise to readers to readers to know that this company still makes losses although it has had a couple of quarters of break-even EBITDA. The company is really not a SaaS vendor and it simply doesn't and never will generate any substantial level of deferred revenue and hence operating cash flow is going to be relatively close to non-GAAP profitability. On the other hand, it is worth noting that the company has achieved cash flow positive status in its last two quarters, although this may be a timing issue on capex as opposed to something substantive. Unfortunately, the company does use moderate amounts of stock-based comp. This year's estimate for stock-based comp is about $17 million or a bit more than 8% of forecast revenues.Again, hardly surprisingly, the result of the company's financial performance has engendered some seriously negative opinion expressed in some articles as I alluded to above. I think it is reasonable to say that this company would have a far more difficult time in reaching the public markets with its financial performance in the current environment. On the other hand, one of the articles which suggested that there is a limited market for what this company does seems a bit non-objective to me.Do students really want to go to Yale or Northwestern or Georgetown online?There are, to be sure, many issues involved in evaluating 2U's prospects but the first significant issue is basically demand. What this company does, which is to try to replicate something very close to the experience students get at a top notch university without having to physically go there, is something that has simply not been tried out in exactly the way it is being offered by 2U in the past. It is one of those things you really can't assess very easily because it has never been done in just this way in the past. The higher education market is vast. Some recent research says that students spend $555 billion a year going to college and spend $80 billion/year of that going to graduate school which has been the first focus of 2U's efforts. Needless to say, Federal and State funding for tuition support is substantial and that alone makes cost mitigation strategies imperative. While I believe that 2U will have little trouble in finding schools with which to partner, the question is how are students and faculty going to react to the new paradigm.Many observers wonder just how many prestigious universities are going to sign up for partnering with 2U. For what it is worth, management has spoken about securing 6 agreements this year, 9 in 2017 and 12 in 2018. (By agreements, this company refers to specific courses that it co-develops with the university. It is the number of programs that is one of the gaiting items with regards to revenue generation.) By the end of 2015, 2U had 14 university partners and was offering 29 programs. The CEO had previously spoken about signing up 6 additional programs during 2016 and it has reached that goal. It has also signed up and announced 8 of the 21 programs it has forecast launching in 2017-2018. The company has no agreements that expire prior to 2021 and has signed renewal agreements with many of its university partners including one recently announced with USC-Rossiter School of Education.I don't think it is terribly surprising that the educational institutions themselves are basically onboard with the concept. How else can they leverage expensive educational resources and receive tuition payments from students they do not have to house or feed or provide classrooms in which the students learn. These days, just the capital costs of new facilities are staggering and the facilities have to be maintained and some agreement needs to be reached with municipalities in lieu of real estate taxes. In New York City, the expansion of the two major universities, NYU and Columbia is taking place on exceptionally valuable land and has stirred significant community ire. I am given to wonder where UCLA 's Westwood campus could actually grow before it encroached on some of the most expensive homes in the nation and commercial facilities in Westwood village.Here is a snippet of a press release announcing the Syracuse University partnership with 2U to develop a J.D. Degree Program that well illuminates the thinking of many universities. ""This partnership will enable the College of Law to reach talented students nationwide and allow us to grant unprecedented access to Syracuse Law's outstanding legal education"" said Kent Syverud, chancellor and president of Syracuse. ""The J.D. program will feature live, face-to-face online classes and dynamic course content delivered through 2U's platform. Syracuse Law faculty will create coursework using 2U's proprietary Bidirectional Learning ToolTM which empowers law professors to teach online…""Of course, Syracuse is enthused about the program. It has the opportunity to substantially increase its revenues without hiring more professors (although that is probably tendentious and open to clarification) or building a single new classroom or dorm or having to deal with a large potential population of students. Education, even in an institution like Syracuse, is a business and businesses that can increase revenues with no additional capital costs and can avoid the complexities of trying to find student housing, student health, and sustenance facilities have found a really nice opportunity.The cost of a 2U education is not inconsiderable and the tuition is the same as a student would spend to get a degree at the physical institution. But all the same, while the income to the university is almost all incremental, the cost to the student is far, far less. Student housing is expensive, the expenses of restaurant meals are not inconsiderable and such things as needing a car to go to school can weigh heavily on student finances. Because of the way 2U structures its programs it is far easier for a student to find work or remain in a job than is the case in a traditional site-based educational process.There have been articles I have read that question whether or not this course or that course is going to achieve the scale needed to justify the investment that 2U makes to develop curriculum in conjunction with the university. One such course that was cited as being less than fully subscribed is the Masters of Information and Data Science that is offered by UC Berkley. At the moment, 2U's partners offer 25 different courses using the 2U technology. I assume that with 25 different courses being offered by 2U, some are likely to be more popular than others. Just on the face, 191 students each paying $60k+ for their tuition would produce nearly $12 million in revenue. We don't know the specific terms of the Berkley contract but typically 2U gets 60% or more of the tuition generated. The company cites an 84% student retention rate. Retention rates for students using 2U technology are far greater than it is for students in MOCC's with which some readers may be familiar. That is not terribly surprising given that the universities themselves actually are the ones who set admission standards and admit the students. In any event, the numbers suggest that so far, 2U has generated about $6 million + from the Berkley relationship. Management says that its upfront investment in a typical course partnership is $7 million to $10 million over 3 years. If an unsuccessful program really almost breaks even, then the profit potential of the other successful programs must be quite significant indeed. But I am not so sure that being able to get a Masters in Information Science will not turn out to be far more popular as a course than the initial enrollment might suggest.So far the largest student pushback about Universities offering courses built on the 2U technology has been the Yale School of Medicine where its Physicians Associate program is still awaiting accreditation. The original announcement came last March and some of the students were, to put it mildly, very upset about the school's decision. Their concerns were that it would decrease the value of their PA degree from Yale. There were also concerns that current students in the program weren't adequately consulted. The resident students were said to be concerned that, ""the rigor and reputation of the online degree will not match those of the regular degree."" One student, a 2014 graduate of the Yale PA program said, ""I'm afraid that an online version only compromises the quality of the PA education and ultimately puts patients and America's health care system at risk.""I am not writing this article in an attempt to assess the quality or potential quality of the Yale 2U program. I can read, however, and the issues of accreditation are those of bureaucracy run wild. The issues are not program quality or program outcomes but whether or not the program was an expansion of what is being offered, or a new kind of program. No guesses for which definition was accepted. Yale now thinks the process of accreditation will take another 18 months but apparently the potential for the program - and by that I mean the financial potential - is great enough that the school is staying the course.I don't think that anyone would pretend that going to an online program would match the overall student experience of a physical education at Yale. There is, to be sure, something to be said for the value of camaraderie, student and faculty support and so forth that can be obtained only in a residence program. There is even more to be said for the experience of enjoying a pizza at Frank Pepe's. In fact, I am yearning for a clam pie about now. On the other hand, the online program that will be offered require the students to do clinical rotations at pre-approved off-site locations. And the program also requires the online students to be on campus for two weeks to learn practical skills.I am not going to solve this debate in this article. I haven't the skill set or the tools to write a scholarly paper on the subject and I doubt that many readers would be interested in such a work if I could do it and it certainly would help readers achieve positive alpha.I think the net of what my conclusions are is: a) many universities need/want to expand their student populations for many reasons - mainly economic, but it is also said to expand their global reach; b) expanding on-site is extremely difficult, time consuming and doesn't solve the basic problem that the incremental cost of an additional student is not equal to the tuition that can be charged; c) 2U's programs, which are not in the same category as the MOOCs that are being offered by some universities, is a decent financial opportunity for the universities; d) the approach offered by universities using the 2U technology is far less costly for most students. They avoid all the expense of essentially moving and setting up a household and can continue to live with their parents or even go to work and e) while some students who are going to resident programs might be unhappy that the student base is being expanded, there appears to be a certainly element of both ""rent seeking"" and of ""ludditeisim"" in their complaints. Something like the 2U technology is going to come to the education world because it is cheaper and achieves more or less the same outcomes as current bricks and mortar education.OK - Maybe I believe that a hybrid online educational process is the wave of the future and that 2U is at the forefront of that movement. I have my doubts, but I want to move on. Does the 2U business model have enough operating leverage to scale or is the company doomed to limp along just marginally profitable?The basic issue in terms of the profitability of the business model is the cost of marketing and sales. That ratio was just over 50% last quarter and while that is down from 57% in the year-earlier quarter it is still at levels that do not allow this company to achieve GAAP profitability. Most of the company's 900 bps improvement in margins came from modest cost constraints on sales and marketing. G&A expense at 20% is also far too high for a company of this size. G&A expense did not come down this quarter as measured by ratios. For the full year of 2015, marketing and sales costs declined as a percentage from 59% to 54%. On the conference call, management essentially said, that beyond the time of the EBITDA break-even and cash-flow break-even, the rate of improvement in margins is going to slow significantly.The basic reason for the relatively slower growth of margins is the faster pace of new program additions. This company needs new program additions in order to grow. Each new program has significant operating and capital costs in its early years. The greater number of new programs that are launched in a particular time period, the greater the growth of both sales and marketing expense and in other opex categories as well. The company has already spoken about ramping the number of new courses it introduces substantially as I indicated earlier so it is not too surprising that the rapid trajectory of margin increases cannot be sustained. 2U has a model in which much of the revenue growth from a new program comes in the first couple of years and then the revenue flattens.The conference commentary, despite the excitement around reaching EBITDA profitability a year earlier than planned, was all about sustaining rapid growth and sustaining rapid growth involves launching new programs. While like many tech companies that make promises of a highly profitable business model at scale, it seems as though this company is going to define scale until revenues double or more from current levels. If investors are looking for high levels of earnings growth, near-term growth in GAAP profitability and accelerated improvement in both operating and free cash flow, this is not the company in which to invest at the moment.With an enterprise value right around $1 billion and with the forecast level of revenues for this year being just above $200 million, the EV/S is 5. That isn't that bad for a company who has a sustainable 30% growth rate. On the other hand, since the company doesn't yet generate even non-GAAP earnings at this point and it will be another year until it can reach free cash flow break even, those metrics are not meaningful at this point. The company has had a consistent history of beats and raises in the 9 quarters since it went public and I believe that it would be reasonable to expect that kind of pattern to continue as well.The business model is going to be easy to fix whenever the company wants to fix it - just reduce both the ratio of sales and marketing and G&A spend. In a growing company as this is, it doesn't mean cutting heads, it means increasing them at a slower pace than the growth in revenues. One assumes that at some point, going to an online study program, particularly in the graduate school area online will become mainstream. But that hasn't happened yet and new programs and new verticals and new relationships have to be marketed and marketed intensively. While the EV/S has come down significantly over the past couple of years with the share price increasing more slowly, overall than the growth in sales, there is still risk that it could contract more.Catalysts, Caveats and CompetitionThere are plenty of competitors in the online education space. But they do not do exactly what this company does. If you want to get an online MBA degree. or nursing degree or JD degree from a prestige university, at this writing 2U is the only company that offers that specific capability. Because of the focus on essentially replicating the university admissions process, the retention rate is 84%, dramatically higher than the other companies in the space. At some point, I suppose, that is going to change but VC funding for ed-tech, certainly isn't what it used to be. Certainly the political assault on for-profit learning organizations has created an environment that is unfriendly to new start-ups selling online education for a profit. Overall, I think the biggest competitive moat this company enjoys is the large upfront costs that are required for a new venture that wants to replicate its strategy of partnering with prestige universities. There is also likely to be the issue of credibility for a start-up. In addition to developing technology, the early years of this company were spent recruiting universities with which to partner. 2U clearly hasn't got the capacity to partner with every prestige university in terms of offering courses emanating from those institutions. But I think it will be hard for a new entrant to land the first few partner universities.There are some real caveats to mention that extend beyond competition and the barriers to entry. The company has seen some management turnover in the first months of this year. Is there anything beyond the fact that people move? Management says no and offers credible reasons why each individual departed. It is an issue to be considered.At one point, investors were concerned with the revenue concentration this company had with just a few universities. As time has passed and many more universities are partnering with 2U, that concern has diminished. In addition, concerns have been expressed at the satisfaction of universities with 2U's service and some comments focused on the renewal risks. At the very least, there are no renewals with any of the universities coming up until 2021 and the company has seen a significant number of renewals from its initial cohort of customers.I think the real caveat here is the pace at which this system of learning is fully accepted by professors and students. Most professors and essentially all students and their parents simply do not care about university finances. At the end of the day, like most people, I suppose, both professors and students are rent seekers and want to keep their club as exclusive as possible. The rent they are seeking to maximize is the value of their degree and they seem to feel that it would be threatened by online degrees. Things change in the world. If it costs dramatically less to get an online degree from a high quality university and the quality of the experience and the quantifiable outcomes are similar, the kinds of courses that 2U facilitates are going to substantially grow and the reputation and value of the courses will gradually enhance.Obviously, a company that doesn't earn money and has a billion market capitalization is expensive. And given that management intends to maximize growth and will do at the expense of any further dramatic increases in profitability is surely likely to deter some investors. It is what it is. If the company continues on its growth trajectory it will reach $600 million + in annual revenues by the end of the decade. I think if that happens, most everything else falls into place. I think it is going to happen. I have tried to lay out the facts as objectively as possible.The major catalysts going forward for 2U are likely to be additional announcements of new course initiatives and new university partners. The company is starting to offer some courses for undergraduates but not to the extent where the offered courses replace the resident student experience. Success in that program, while hardly guaranteed, would be a huge catalyst if it moves forward given the far greater size of the TAM for undergraduate education spend. And needless to say, earnings releases will often move the shares, although the response to the latest beat and raise quarter announced by the company on May 5th was barely perceptible.Summing Up2U is a company trying to build an unduplicated niche in the online education field. Its mantra is to help facilitate prestige universities to offer online degrees in selected graduate fields of study using both an online approach coupled with some physical hands-on interactions. It has been quite successful in signing up a significant cohort of universities including one, Yale, in the Ivy league and another, UC Berkley, amongst the bright lights in the American higher education pantheon.The company has a high valuation and no profits and no cash flow. While 2U will reach EBITDA ""profitability"" this year, a year ahead of schedule, the basic valuation metrics aren't there yet, although the EV/S metric of 5X is dramatically lower than it was a few months ago when the shares were 40% higher and the sales level was significantly lower than it is today. On the other hand, the company has indicated that after it reaches EBITDA profitability, it intends to improve margins far more slowly than heretofore in an effort to broaden its business base and to achieve true levels of scale.I think that this kind of hybrid online model that 2U offers, addresses many of the issues faced by today's universities and the student bodies of most prestige institutions. I think it is impossible to continue to expand prestige universities at a significant rate given the high capital costs incurred, the incursions into residential neighborhoods and the issues surrounding ever higher tuition. This kind of online model is one of the few opportunities that universities have to enhance the productivity of their staff and to earn additional tuition without the risk of setting up courses in new disciplines. I have tried to point out some of the risks above and that may deter some risk intolerant investors. This investment may not offer the kind of asymmetric returns many investors wish to have.But this is an interesting name to consider for most growth, risk tolerant investors and while it is anything but a defensive or value stock, in the right kind of market it will achieve noticeable positive alpha."

The E-Learning, or EdTech, component of this industry has been valued, by gminsights, at upwards of $165bn, with predictions for its growth over the next six years suggesting the market will exceed $240bn in value.It is not only ever-rising internet usage statistics that paint a rosy picture for the industry's growth either. With the rise of the ""boutique"" career, the fall of the ""company man,"" and a need to continuously reinvent yourself, without the time to go back and study for several years, eLearning certainly fills more than a niche. This article focuses in on one particular eLearning Stock, 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU), which you might like to add to your portfolio as a long to medium-term holding.2U - 1 Year Share Price. Source: Bloomberg2U, with a market capitalisation of $1.67bn, has had an excellent year in terms of its share price, posting just over 100% share price growth. The year to date doesn't look too bad either, with its stock valued almost 17% higher than its turn of the year trading price. Running the rule over a broad list of analysis, for instance those at Credit Suisse, the consensus target price is in approximately the $43 to $45 range, suggesting that there is room for upward of 15% further share price growth for the Maryland-based company, meaning that annual share price growth would correlate closely to projected revenue growth in the mid-to-high thirties.2U Revenues + Projections. Source: FT2U, founded in 2008, with a successful IPO staged in 2014, is one of the top providers of cloud software for non-profit colleges and universities, helping them to deliver online degree programs, featuring video classes, and a social learning platform. The company pushes its No Back Row approach, which has a student-centred focus, with small class sizes, career services, and field placements, being key components.Such an approach has led to high attention rates (upwards of 80%), which certainly helps to keep its clients, both universities and students, happy. Indeed, a significant amount of 2U's revenue comes directly from tuition costs, with the company getting up to 60% of tuition fees from the programs it supports.Full Year Revenues '11-'15. Source: FTSo, how is the company performing? Final accounts for 2016 are not due to be released until February 23rd, after the close of the market, but whilst the company continues to grow, it continues to post a loss, with Q3's net loss coming in at $2.7m or $.06 per share. This isn't perfect, but it's a significant improvement on the previous year's figures of $4.9m and $.12/share.Also, whilst revenues continue to rise, costs are beginning to dip as its reputation starts to do some of the legwork for its marketing department, with sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue falling to 59%, according to Neha Gupta of investcorrectly. As 2017 rolls on, so has 2U, signing several new partnership agreements to date. These include, for instance, deals with Vanderbilt University and Pepperdine, and the Maxwell school.Earnings data + Forecasts. Source: FTConsidering the as yet unannounced fourth quarter results, expectations are broadly positive, with revenue projected in the $56m range, losses similar to Q3, and a net income of up to $1.5m. What this means for the year is that the eLearning company expects revenues of just under $205m for the whole year.As far as 2017 is concerned, 2U's own projections match those earlier mentioned, with the company anticipating growth of around 30%, and less positively, but not wholly negatively, continuing losses of approximately 10%. Losses seem set to continue to drop year on year, and as the company expands the programs it offers, it appears to have little doubt that profits will, in the long term, come steadily in.Forecasts TWOU. Source: FT2U, in targeting the graduate market, and pursuing an educational services delivery model, with tuition-splitting as a component, operating in the growing eLearning sector, is well positioned to continue to grow, both in terms of its revenues, and its share price. In this outside provisioning market, 2U is one of the biggest players, and the company's success has also been recognised externally, with it being recognised as one of the most innovative education companies by Fast Company's 2017 surveys.2U Balance Sheets - Source: FTThis is not to suggest that the Maryland company does not have areas of concern. Whilst expansion costs money, and making a loss is not necessarily a negative indication, and its revenues are up, its continued year-on-year losses do make it more susceptible to existential risks than it would otherwise be. These losses in the medium term are expected to continue, although its strong balance sheet does help to offset this worry. Further to this, the eLearning market is not yet mature, and competition and disruption will continue to emerge, so 2U, although it does not appear to be, cannot rest on its laurels, and any sign that it is will be punished.What stands in the company's favour, aside from its growth potential is its clarity of purpose; it does not intend to try to provide everything and become an all-out university course provider. It provides the online service, and the marketing platforms, and lets the universities deal with the rest. Keeping things simple is usually a good idea, and 2U hopes to do so. Furthermore, the fact that it does its best to sign long-term contracts with university partners, at between five to ten years in length, tends to strengthen the accuracy of its predictions, and thereby its planning.Like simplicity, certainty helps. Most importantly, however, the market continues to grow, and the addressable market is significant, and with flexibility a premium, and disruption in the higher education market expected by many, stocks like 2U ought to continue to see their value rise. If you're considering a medium-term investment in a growth stock, with the potential for strong 2017 returns, 2U might be one to add to your portfolio.(Oisin Breen, Research Analyst)"

3190006,48411,2015-05-17T15:58:56-04:00,"TWOU posted a great Q1/15 but it was the announcement that the company will accelerate its launch schedule that has me excited.TWOU's model is realizing more leverage at a quicker pace than originally anticipated which allows TWOU to replace near-term, model-driven profitability with growth.In a space with fragmented competition I am in complete agreement with this aggressive strategy as I personally believe landing and expanding is more important than profitability currently.This only furthers my belief that TWOU will be the single largest and most defensible name in the space in the mid- and long-term.Continue to be long TWOU.","2U (NASDAQ:TWOU) is finally getting aggressive and I like it. I like it a lot.I've been opining for several quarters now that TWOU's model is showing accelerated leverage and that it could reach profitability, in fact be wildly profitable, if it simply stopped initiating new programs and realized the revenues coming in from its existing base. As TWOU's overall model matures, which really investors should view each full year of program launches as an individual cohort, it gets more profitable. This isn't unusual for subscription based models but for some reason this was a fact missed by the market at TWOU's overlooked IPO, missed by the market at each earnings period prior to this one as TWOU operated in the net loss, and missed by the market until recently when it appears sentiment has seemingly shifted bullish TWOU.But, what is unusual about TWOU's model is that it actually has up-front, large up-front costs of installation and implementation for each new customer. How does this change the traditional subscription model? This means that the front-end expenses are especially altering to the income statement.You see, TWOU actually helps participate in the content creation that powers the programs it launches. So what this means is that unlike say a subscription investment research website that has a one-time up-front cost of infrastructure for all business to follow (obviously with the understanding that incremental upkeep costs will exist as well) TWOU constantly has to take on negative margin and expenses at the inception of new business. You can imagine in the early going of launching customers when the ""cohort"" weighting is heavily towards that of immature programs that TWOU's income statement would look especially pressured. Even more so than a traditional subscription model. I hope I've explained that adequately because that's been the entire immediate upside case for TWOU's equity to this point. That there was a large misunderstanding of the model and the constant up front expenses to growth the topline.The other misunderstanding was that each follow-on, or secondary program, which TWOU launched at the same school didn't require as large an up-front expense and sometimes none at all (on rare occasions). These secondary programs are much higher from a margin standpoint and obviously then breakeven quicker.Now, with that in mind - that TWOU realizes that its model is realizing leverage faster than it had expected as a result of 1) more secondary launches and 2) better enrollment numbers, TWOU has decided to increase its growth rate (further land and expand) rather than allow the model to reach profitability ahead of schedule. I couldn't agree more with this.This space is very fragmented currently from a competition standpoint and TWOU has a unique benefit and model that it is deploying to partner schools. Why not increase the launch schedule and aggregate market share before more competition comes along? In fact, I'd be in favor of TWOU taking its growth two steps further. I'd be in favor of TWOU doing a debt and equity offering, especially with the equity trading where it is in relation to where it came from at IPO, loading the balance sheet with funding, and growing at as fast a pace is possible while still maintaining quality.With a company like TWOU and the opportunity that it has long term if you're invested in this name you have to be happy with the idea that TWOU isn't trying to push for any next quarter or next year goals - that the company has a long-term view. In that, I'd be more than happy to take some dilution and some leverage in an effort to establish a company that I own equity in as the single leader in the space. I just think that 5 years from now we're all going to be looking at this company and the one or two companies that I'm sure will rank alongside it as the higher-ed arena continues to adopt high-quality online education and think how we all saw the writing on the wall.TWOU has a chance to build something special that also happens to be highly visible. I'm all for sacrificing income statement profitability, the company still intends to be Adjusted EBITDA profitable by no later than 2017, for some longer term viability. I'm very happy to see management wanting to get aggressive and wanting to position this stock to move higher into the long-term.I continue to recommend a long position in TWOU. Good luck everybody."

For my investment portfolio, I'm seeking out stocks that have been able to ignore the turbulence and continue on their own uptrend. I want to find individual stocks that will continue to rise because they have a successful and sustainable strategy at work.Looking at the financial ratios that the market is valuing 2 U (NASDAQ:TWOU) would leave many prospective investors on the sidelines. The viewpoint in this article is a case in point. TWOU is trading at 18x book, 13 x sales and has a PEG of -3 according to Yahoo Finance. Not really numbers that attract investors. In this article I want to explain what I think is fueling the stock's rise and determine if the run is sustainable or not. I'm going to explain what the company does, how it's currently performing technically as well as fundamentally, the industry forecast, the company's position within the industry and review the company's strategy in my conclusion.2U provides a cloud-based software-as-a-service platform for colleges and universities. Basically, the company creates a digital extension of the college or university that it serves. TWOU doesn't have a long track record as a publicly traded company. It debuted as an IPO in March 2014 at $13/share and despite not making a profit during its history as a publicly traded company, the stock price has rocketed to the mid $30s, where it's currently trading, about a 300% rise while riding the wave on its 50-day moving average:TWOU data by YChartsTWOU has beat top and bottom line estimates for each quarter since its IPO. On Aug. 6, the company reported second quarter revenue increased 42% higher than the prior year and net loss was reduced by over 30% in comparison to the prior year. This is where it starts to look interesting. Increasing revenue and decreasing losses led me to take a look at the operating margins. TWOU has been lowering operating expenses as a percentage of revenue as it has done for each quarter since becoming a publicly traded company.The operating expenses are being reduced, but they are still very high. I dug a little deeper and found that TWOU could be profitable if they decided to change their business model. The current strategy is placing a priority on growth by expansion, banking on future profitability instead of on organic growth which has exceeded 40%. The company is in a position that it could rely on predictable recurring revenue from its existing business but it has chosen to continue growing its customer base. Taking on a new customer or expanding course offerings for an existing customer requires heavy development expenses. Management figures that if they don't take on new business, someone else will, and they are taking on some of the largest opportunities such as the just announced partnership with UNC and another with NYU, one of the largest universities in the world and the largest deal in TWOU history. ""We'll continue to plant flags with new programs as well, as well as expand our relationships with existing partners to take advantage of the growth opportunities in front of us. They're too large to not seize. For that reason, we now expect to launch no fewer than six programs in 2016."" (CEO Chip Paucek at the last conference call.)TWOU does not want to let opportunities slip because it is aiming to be the market leader in its industry. Besides sheer size, the company is building a moat by offering a full range of services and by making their contracts long term such as the Masters of Public Law at UNC Chapel Hill which expires in 2032. What differentiates TWOU from its competition is that it takes on both front end and back end responsibilities, hence the expense in taking on a new project. TWOU performs student recruitment, tech support, student counseling and job placement through its vast international network.The online education industry is experiencing dramatic growth. Driving factors for colleges and universities is the ability to offer online courses and the reduction in costs that can be passed on to the students while the educator retains a higher profit margin. Learning institutions realize that if they don't offer online learning opportunities, somebody else will.TWOU I believe is the only company that operates exclusively in the niche of partnering with higher learning institutions to offer online learning or cloud based software as a service, but it competes indirectly with companies such as John Willey and Sons, Pearson (NYSE:PSO), China Distance Education (NYSE:DL) and Tarina International (NASDAQ:TEDU).Management has ramped up its growth plan. At the time of the IPO, the plan was to add four new programs per year, later increased to five and now no fewer than six without taking on new debt. The company has about $88 million in cash and no debt and is self funding its growth. Despite the expenses incurred by growth such as increased headcount, new technology and additional office space, the company forecasts profitability in 2017. Management has walked a fine line between profitability and growth and built a successful and predictable business plan that can easily forecast revenue. It will certainly increase its expansion in the future as it continues to improve operating margins.A major reason for a high degree of confidence in the TWOU business model is that they are spending heavily to build a brand name and to establish perception of quality in online education by partnering with the most prestigious and elite higher education colleges and universities. They are laying the foundation for a moat as they establish successful results through their placement program. I believe that TWOU is creating an elite brand in online education and that their addressable market is barely penetrated. TWOU has established a business model that allows them to expand without taking on new debt. Profitability is just a few years away at which point the recurring revenue machine that is being built promises handsome returns for investors."
4281613,25120,2019-08-05T09:36:43-04:00,"2U offers online education as students look for increased flexibility and lower costs, making the business model interesting.Unfortunately, the company is seeing stiff competition from colleges and universities going online as well.Despite the dramatic performance of the shares, I fail to see real fundamental support or appeal at current levels.","2U (NASDAQ:TWOU) has surfaced on my radar as the free fall in the share price continued last week, with shares trading at just $13 and change currently, while shares nearly hit the $100 mark this time last year.That makes me interested to review the situation on 2U, something which I have not done since I initially covered the company when it went public in April of 2014, more than five years ago.Back in 2014, I looked at 2U which was a fast-growing SaaS education business provider which reported accelerating topline sales growth, while losses were stabilising. While this looked quite compelling, I required greater improvements before becoming appealed to the shares.The online learning platform looks compelling with the cost of education on the rise and people, including students, desiring to have more control over their time and schedule. Increased flexibility and greater cost-effective solutions make sense, certainly in an education market waiting to be disrupted.Back in 2014, shares were sold at $13 apiece, which implied a $510 million equity valuation for the company at the time. This was based on 31,000 equivalent full courses being enrolled, with roughly 8,500 individuals having enrolled to 2U's education solutions. The company generated $83 million in sales in 2013, up 48% on the year before. Despite, or perhaps as a result of, the rapid growth, the company lost about $28 million.With operating assets trading around 5 times sales, I noted that the sales multiple looked reasonable in relation to the sales growth and potential market opportunity, which made me cautiously optimistic, if not for the fact that losses were quite big.Since 2013, the company has seen solid growth over time. Revenues rose by 33% to $110 million in 2014, with adjusted losses narrowing slightly to $21 million. Revenue growth accelerated to 36% in 2015 with revenues hitting the $150 million mark, while adjusted losses contracted to $14 million.The company continued to report similar growth rates with sales up 37% in 2016 to $206 million, while adjusted losses came in at $5 million. With adjusted losses coming down and sales growth slightly accelerating, operating results started to translate into higher share prices as well.By the time the 2017 results were released in early 2018, shares were rapidly moving towards the $100 mark. For 2017, the company reported a 39% increase in sales, marking the fourth year in a row in which sales growth accelerated, as revenues hit $287 million. With a diluted share count of 56 million shares, the company was almost awarded a $5 billion valuation. This is about 10 times the value of the business at the time of the IPO, mostly because the huge run-up seen in the share price, accompanied by some dilution as well.The 2017 results were accompanied by a decent outlook for 2018. The company saw sales at $398-403 million, setting the company up for another year of nearly 40% revenue growth. Adjusted net losses were no longer expected to contract, seen at $6-8 million according to the original guidance.After reporting the first quarter results for 2018, the company even hiked the midpoint of the sales guidance to roughly $408 million and in fact sold 3.3 million shares at $90 late spring of last year! Momentum continued as the full-year sales guidance was hiked to $411 million when the second quarter results were released later that summer.Yet something went wrong at least in the share price performance. During the fierce sell-off heading into Christmas of 2018, notably high-fliers have seen shares come under a lot of pressure. Shares briefly fell below the $50 mark, yet recovered to levels in the mid-seventies in March of 2019, as the wider market recovered as well. Momentum in the actual business was still pretty good as revenues for all of 2018 were up by 44% to $412 million, although fourth quarter sales growth of 33% was less impressive.The company guided for 2019 sales at a midpoint of $548 million, suggesting continuation of the impressive growth. While adjusted loss of little over $3 million for all of 2018 was a good result, the guidance which called for 2019 adjusted losses of around $20 million is rather disappointing. This is most certainly as it excludes projected $54 million in stock-based compensation expenses.A couple of things happened in spring. In April, the company acquired Trilogy Education in a $750 million deal, financed through both cash and stock. The company guided for a 2019 revenue contribution of $135 million, depending on the timing of deal closing. In May, shares fell to the low forties upon the release of the first quarter results, with growth decelerating to 32% as the company cut the full-year sales guidance to around $535 million.The issue is with the second quarter results, released last week. While the company hiked the full year guidance to $570 million, note that this suggests just a $35 million net increase compared to the guidance issued alongside the first quarter results. At the time of the Trilogy deal announcement, a $135 million revenue contribution was expected for 2019. With the deal closing within roughly 6 weeks following the announcement, it seems that there were no major delays in closing the deal.That suggests a $100 million revenue shortfall on a revenue base of $570 million. In fact, it gets worse as the entire revenue shortfall is only ""seen"" in a period of just two quarters. Furthermore, adjusted net losses are now seen at $74 million at the midpoint of the guidance, a more than $50 million headwind from the original guidance.Little over a year ago, 2U was a $5 billion company trading at nearly $100 per share, while shares now change hands at just $14. With 60.5 million shares outstanding, the equity valuation has been crushed to $850 million, as the company operates with a modest $25 million net debt load, or closer to $90 million if lease liabilities are included as well. In either case, the valuation for the entire business comes in short of a billion.The reason for the low expectations is simply the crushing losses reported by the business. This stands in sharp contrast to years of impressive sales growth being combined with narrowing (adjusted) losses, as progress on the bottom line has reversed in a big way.With realistic losses seen far above $100 million (remember that adjusted losses of around $75 million exclude more than $50 million in stock-based compensation), it is very hard to become even remotely upbeat on the business and shares. Given the current losses, the company will rapidly incur a growing net debt position as EBITDA metrics are both very modest and questionable, while the stock is trading at depressed levels. The latter makes it far from attractive or possible to use stock as a currency to raise funds.The company admits that competition from colleges moving online themselves is creating huge headwinds, making that the business is disrupted in its own game.That is quite ironic as this should have been the business which should have seen this trend coming. While I am always attracted to huge declines in share prices, this decline is really ""supported"" by the fundamentals and exploding debt levels in the quarters to come. Hence, I fail to see why I should become upbeat here. I want to give a big compliment to fellow author Gary Alexander who has written numerous articles on this platform on the stock and has been very accurate with his views. I share a very cautious view, despite the move seen in the shares already."

That's right, 2U was unable to pass one of its partnered online courses through accreditation. Why not? Does the company expect to generate positive cash flow this year? No. Why not? What happened at Yale? Might the same thing happen with other potential customers? These questions are both valid and exigent. So why is the market consistently ignoring them? Perhaps the company deserves a closer look.In my debut article for Seeking Alpha, I chose to write about a severely undervalued platform-tech company with a potentially bright future ahead of itself. Today, I would like to spend a little bit of time analyzing a potential peer company: 2U Inc. I say ""potential"" because 2U appears to be more of an outsourcing company than a true platform technology company such as the one in my previous article. More on this later, but here's what 2U says it does (from Google Finance):Before writing the aforementioned article, I had not heard much about 2U. From what I could gather, it seemed like a ""hot SaaS stock"" with a solid marketing strategy and plenty of room for upside. In the valuation segment of my previous article, I wanted to pit my ""David"" of a company against a few ""Goliaths"" within the sector. Remembering what I had heard about 2U, I decided to take a deeper look into the company, as I wanted to verify that it was a similar enough peer to meaningfully juxtapose with the company in my first article.I couldn't help but notice 2U's hefty valuation quite early in the research process. At a current P/S ratio of 10.79x, it is trading at more than twice the industry standard of 4.71x. Even more alarming was the fact that the company has yet to create even $1 of earnings. Ultimately, I started to feel more and more puzzled by its colossal valuation. I looked harder to find a catalyst for all of the Wall Street hype, but I continually found myself asking, ""where's the beef?"" Perhaps it's time to aim that very question at 2U.(Source)Shoddy Earnings HistoryOne should quickly note 2U's lackluster financial history with a cursory glance. As stated above, the company has yet to generate any earnings. In addition to the company's unprofitability, 2U's annual net loss has remained stagnant: currently hovering between -$20 and -$30 million USD.(Source: Google Finance)Revenue is growing at a steady rate, but what about costs? It seems like as the revenue is increasing Y/Y, so too is the income-killing SGA expense. There could be an explanation for this trend that will be addressed later in the article.Let's take a look at the EPS history:(Source: Google Finance)At the very best, there seem to be no foreseeable trends forming, just stagnancy. One could make a case for a steady decline in EPS, but it may be too early to tell with confidence. Sure, EPS may not be worsening at an alarming rate, but a steady negative EPS should not be attractive to current or potential investors.All in all, 2U's financial position should not be contributing to its generous valuation.A Flaw in the Business Model?A well-suited SaaS business will usually follow a profitability pattern similar to the one shown in the slide posted below. Heavy initial investments that are crucial to the core business of a company will keep it unprofitable on an earnings basis until an inflection point is reached, after which the company can begin on its path to earnings creation. However, free cash generation might be quite positive early on.For the complete slideshow, check out David Skok's slideshare.Although the model may seem very straightforward, there are many factors that can complicate the profitability of a SaaS business. First and foremost, the secret behind any successful SaaS business is the company's ability to consistently maintain low overhead costs, while also maintaining healthy organic Y/Y growth. For SaaS companies with inconsistent sales cycles like 2U, the biggest factor in keeping deals profitable is mitigating costs of acquiring new customers (CACs). The model should resemble the figure below.Furthermore, SaaS companies often maintain low customer acquisition costs by keeping the customer acquisition process automated. However, the more complex the sale is, the more effort (or dollars) a company must spend in order to even have a chance of landing the deal. In fact, the most costly factor in customer acquisition for SaaS businesses is the introduction of the human element, or hiring field sales employees to sell the product in question. The cash burn that comes along with hiring these sales employees is highly detrimental to the overall profitability of a potential deal.So, to bring those increased costs full circle, they will postpone the profitability inflection point, and in turn, decelerate the earnings power of the business, as shown in the slide below.Finally, let's apply this information to the company. Remember the speculation over rising SGA expenses noted earlier in the article? It could simply be attributed to an inability to maintain CACs. If that is the case, 2U could be in big trouble. Since the company must convince potential clients that its online platform is useful and effective, 2U must exert a considerable effort (and therefore, a considerable chunk of change) to sell its product. More specifically, as 2U must hire a sales team to convince its potential clients that the company's product is useful and effective, it must take on the inevitable cash burn that comes along with said sales team. If 2U must dish out cash every quarter to maintain and build new client relationships, it will most likely have trouble shrinking its compounding SGA expense. This very point draws me to believe that the so called ""SaaS"" business model is, best case, flawed, and worst case, not even truly a SaaS business at all. To conclude, profitability does not look like a near-term probability. Perhaps the relationships may prove to be profitable somewhere down the line, but as 2U continues to grow, the company will most likely continue to spend more and more on acquiring customers.When Will 2U Make Money?Case in point, CACs have the ability to make or break profits. Even if billing revenue were to rise at an exponential rate for the next five years, it would mean nothing without 2U first taming its rising CACs. If management cannot find a solution to this problem, there is a high possibility that the company continues its pattern of unprofitability for a considerable amount of time. Investors, beware.To put that theory into practice, let's take a look at 2U's most recent quarterly results from May 7th, 2105. Q1 revenue has increased 31% Y/Y (from $26.33m to $34.61m). So too have Q1 SGA expenses increased, by 27% Y/Y (from $20.68m to $26.30m). 2U has shown that it can increase its Y/Y revenue by double digits, but it has not shown that it can also mitigate SGA expenses at the same time.AccreditationBy now, it should not be news that Yale's online physician assistant program was denied accreditation by The Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA). Yet, this fact is NOT widely publicized.To reiterate: 2U was unable to pass one of its partnered online courses through accreditation. Sure, not all of the courses 2U helps develop will get approved, but it seems almost embarrassing that the company could not capitalize its success with the institution it chose to implement a full-on media blitz with. In fact, when 2U finally did partner with Yale, it made sure to spread the news far and wide. I was able to find four articles announcing the partnership on the company website; however, I could not find one announcing that it had failed to accredit the program it so heavily advertised. I must say, 2U's public relations department is doing an incredible job keeping this blunder swept under the rug. Furthermore, I was not surprised to see CEO Chip Paucek sidestepping the matter in a New York Times article. Paucek downplays the problem by offering the cookie-cutter response of, ""Accreditation... is a hurdle in each new field."" Perhaps this hurdle could have been avoided in the first place if Yale had not chosen to work with 2U. Of course, accreditation can prove to be quite a hurdle, but should it be a hurdle for a company whose core business is creating and aiding programs along the accreditation process? Later in the article, he redirects everyone's attention to a few of 2U's prior successes in order to cover up the blemish.For further reading about the accreditation failure, check out this Yale Daily News article and this one as well.I ask again… Where's the Beef?In putting all of 2U's puzzle pieces together, the final picture is starting to form. 2U is an overvalued market darling with very few positive fundamentals:With current yearly sales estimates of $145 million and next-year sales estimates of $187 million, 2U is projected to grow at around ~29% Y/Y. I cannot wrap my head around the company's gargantuan valuation relative to its future prospects and slowing growth estimates.For that reason, and the reasons stated prior, I will continue to avoid 2U until its business model proves its earnings capability. At the very least, I may reconsider my stance if the company can show signs of near-term profitability, while also mitigating CAC-related cash burn. However, keep in mind that 2U will only become a worthwhile investment if/when it trades at a more reasonable valuation. At this point in time, it seems that all of the potential for this business is priced in (speculatively over-priced in) to its current valuation."
4107519,103480,2017-09-18T02:09:58-04:00,"2U stock has nearly doubled this year, pricing the company for perfection and making it susceptible to any execution stumbles.Trading at 8.5x forward revenues, the company is in the upper echelon of tech stock valuations, neck-and-neck with companies that are growing much faster.2U's business model is not truly SaaS, as each additional client deployment requires customized development and incurs large costs.2U's revenue model of taking a fee out of tuition costs may face headwinds as universities resist and build their own online classroom solutions.","2U (NASDAQ: TWOU) has a really good story to pitch to investors - it's a small wonder the stock has gone from $13 in its 2014 IPO to nearly $55 in September 2017. Half of these gains were achieved this year - since January, the stock has nearly doubled, while performance has remained good but not great.TWOU data by YChartsAt face value, 2U's story is nearly infallible. Education is one of the last realms to truly undergo an attack by Silicon Valley, and 2U is helping colleges and universities bring some of their degree programs online. In return, 2U takes a slice out of the tuition fees the university earns from students enrolling in these online-only programs.If it was easy for 2U to roll out new program, then it could be considered a SaaS company and its valuation would be justified. But it's not.Consider ed-tech ""peer"" Instructure (NASDAQ: INST), for example. Instructure provides a learning management system (""LMS""); so it's not a direct competitor to 2U. Instructure doesn't really have to lift a finger to bring a new college onto its platform - its online grading system, course enrollment tools, and discussion boards are apples-to-apples no matter what university is using it. If a university wants to build custom features into its Canvas deployment, they can have their own developers build them. Instructure is a true SaaS company - it can expand broadly without expending too much effort and cost into each new deployment.2U is different: its product digitizes an entire degree program into its online platform. For an online nursing degree program, for example, 2U has to employ its own developer army to transform that specific university's lectures, course content, and media into the online format. 2U is more of a consultant - each deployment is different; it's not a self-service model and it's not easily expandable.I would encourage investors to stay away from the hype surrounding this stock. 2U does have a cool, niche business and it's clearly worth something - but certainly not the $2.5-billion valuation it has notched, at least not yet.""No Back Row."" This is the company slogan, positing that students will engage more in immersible online content from the comfort of their homes rather than slouching in chairs at the back of a crowded lecture hall.2U partners with universities and colleges (it calls them ""clients"") to digitize degree programs and bring course content online. 2U's solution is intended to uproot the entire on-campus experience, delivering the full course lifecycle from enrollment to degree conferring via web browser.2U's solutions are primarily deployed for domestic graduate programs (""DGPs""), which are verticalized specializations in fields such as data science, nursing, education, and communications. Graduate-level students enroll in the university's online program (built by 2U and ""white-labeled"" with the university's brand) and 2U, in turn, gets a cut of the tuition.The first deployment in 2009 was an education program offered by the University of Southern California or USC. See the timeline below for an indicative look at 2U's expansion since then:Figure 1. 2U degree program launch timelineSource: 2U investor presentation2U currently has 47 DGPs in its portfolio across 22 universities. While it has some brand-name schools in its portfolio (USC, Berkeley, NYU, and Georgetown), the majority of schools in the portfolio are lesser known. Across these 22 universities, 2U has 28,865 students enrolled in its DGPs, on which 2U earns a tuition cut.2U has aggressive expansion plans in the DGP arena - it believes there are 60-90 degree verticalizations in the graduate studies sphere, and it plans on having at least one program in each of them. In 2017, 2U plans on launching a total of 10 new DGPs (representative schools include NYU, Pepperdine University, Vanderbilt University, and the University of Dayton). See 2U's planned launch pipeline below:Figure 2. 2U DGP launch targetsAt a steady state, 2U believes each DGP can bring in $16 million of annual revenues. Note, however at the end of 2016, 2U had 41 degree programs and $205.6 million in annual revenues, meaning each generated only $5 million in annual revenues. Though this metric might be skewed by the newer programs with late-2016 launches, it's still pretty clear that 2U has a long way to go to achieve its steady state per-program revenue target.Also worth noting is that 2U acquired GetSmarter, a South-Africa based ed-tech company specializing in short-form courses, opening 2U's door to shorter-term courses that typically grant certificates. 2U acquired the company for $103 million, including a $20 million cash earn-out if targets are met. GetSmarter claimed to generate $17 million in revenue in 2016, implying a 6x revenue purchase multiple, earn-out excluded. One of the key benefits in the GetSmarter acquisition was taking on the company's established client base, with certificate courses from the likes of Harvard and MIT. The cachet of these world-class universities may lend more credibility to 2U's model, and lead to expansion in new DGPs with these schools.While it remains to be seen how 2U can leverage short-form courses to complement its DGP offerings, GetSmarter is a small part of 2U's revenue base today and is unlikely to grow at a substantially quicker pace than 2U's core DGP business.One of the biggest mistakes investors make when investing in 2U is comparing it to a SaaS company. It's not.SaaS companies can extend their services to a new client at basically no cost, other than third-party hosting fees. A new Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) customer deploying Sales Cloud or a new Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY) customer deploying its HCM cloud platform uses the existing infrastructure out-of-the-box, at no additional development cost to the cloud vendor.2U's DGPs are anything but out-of-the box. Each new course has to be carefully tailored, with content laboriously curated and transferred online, at 2U's expense. And not only does 2U have the responsibility of developing student content - it also has the primary responsibility for recruiting students into these universities' programs. 2U pays for demand generation activities, and new program launches come with significant upfront marketing costs. Indeed, marketing costs are the largest part of 2U's expenses.While 2U does not disclose its per-program profitability and typical expenses, the below chart from 2U's investor presentation shows how the company overall is doing from a margin perspective:Figure 3. 2U growth and marginsWhile scale has allowed 2U to cut down its development cost margins to roughly half in the space of four years, it has been less successful in driving down program marketing costs, which eat up more than half of the company's revenues. It advertises programs on behalf of the university, it digitizes the content and manages the tech backend - and it only receives a cut of tuition.Note also that the chart above presents adjusted margins - 2U also incurs significant stock-based compensation expense that dilutes existing shareholders and makes the above margins appear more tenable.In addition, 2U's growth has slowed down somewhat in 2017. Q2 revenues of $65 million grew only 32% y/y, decelerating markedly from Q1's 37% y/y growth. In Q2, 2U also guided to $282.7-285.7 million in FY17 revenues. Subtracting out $8 million for the estimated impact of 2U's half-year ownership of GetSmarter (the transaction closed on July 1, exactly halfway through 2017), 2U is guiding to a midpoint of $276.2 million in organic revenue or 34% full-year organic growth.This seems pretty rosy for a company that posted only 32% growth in Q2. Guidance ranges typically imply a growth figure that's below the growth percentage achieved in the most recent quarter, not above it. There's plenty of room for 2U to skid to the downside if it fails in meeting its targets. It may be banking on a swath of new program introductions - but a new DGP doesn't generate revenue right away, at least not at scale. New DGPs, in the first year, bring more expenses than revenues, and it remains to be seen if 2U can scale its sprawling portfolio of DGPs toward true profitability.2U isn't a SaaS company, offering out-of-the-box solutions and easily extendable to an expanded client base. At best, 2U is a third-party consulting or business process outsourcing company that takes on the work of course development and program marketing on behalf of a university, and gets paid on a commission basis rather than with an upfront fee. At worst, because 2U actually takes on the bulk of risk and expense for its online programs, 2U can also be considered a for-profit education company, even though the universities it partners with are nonprofits.We all know how unpopular for-profit education companies are, and the fate that typically befalls them. While 2U masks its identity by stressing its technology and SaaS angles, a look at the business model and the underlying profitability economics of its degree programs suggests something different.Confusion among investors over 2U and the nature of its business has stirred great debate over 2U's valuation, and thus far in 2017 the bulls have won, awarding it high-growth SaaS-style valuation.Figure 4. 2U trading comps, EV/FTM revenues valuationTWOU EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsPresented in the chart above are some of the software sector's most expensive names. Each of these companies, like 2U, is growing in excess of 30%, but unlike 2U, these companies deliver software-style gross margins in the high 70s and 80s.Due to 2U's heavy upfront costs in developing programs and marketing them to potential students, 2U's new program launches have little of the favorable economics that SaaS companies enjoy.While SaaS companies also incur heavy expenses via large direct sales forces, they tend to hang on to clients much longer. Once deployed, an HCM or ERP system is extremely difficult to rip out, and software companies typically report gross client retention rates in the high 90s, indicating very little churn.For 2U, students churn naturally. After the completion of a one or two-year degree program, students - and their valuable tuition payments - leave the installed base. And even among the students who don't churn naturally via graduation, 2U reports only an 83% retention rate in its student base. Online graduate courses, after all, are much more non-committal than full, 2-year on-campus graduate programs and students can decide to quit any time.With neither the profitability economics of a software company nor the retention capabilities of a true SaaS application, it's a wonder how 2U manages to trade in the higher echelons of tech valuations.Enthusiasm for the company's innovative (if not flawed) business model has propped up the company's valuation, but it's supported mainly by hype and not fundamentals. Hype is much more difficult to sustain as a company ages and becomes less newsworthy, and when enthusiasm for 2U bursts, investors will be left empty-handed."
3054626,48411,2015-04-07T10:15:38-04:00,"I continue to be bullish TWOU.TWOU's model is doing what it has done since its IPO: show leverage, improve key metrics, and shrink operational cash burn.With TWOU's entry into the Ivy League, a clear endorsement of its quality and capacity, expect key metrics to improve in a big way.","I wanted to write a rebuttal article to an article recently published on the Seeking Alpha PRO platform about 2U, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWOU) and its prospects as a long position.Now, I will make the case that 2U (a higher education online/technology company) remains a highly attractive long position and one that is 1) already showing the evidence of clear operating leverage within its model, 2) has excellent prospects to continue to do this, and 3) has zero accounting irregularities - one of the allegations made in the PRO article.Shares are up 86.1% since I initiated coverage on TWOU back in late-March 2014. I continue to recommend a long position in this name and I continue to provide continuing coverage of this name and its developments:Capitalization…I'll keep this as short as I can. Let's get to the main issue I'm rebutting and that's the capitalization uses by TWOU and the question of ""is this irregular."" The simple answer is no. It just isn't.Now, the author of the rebutted article never directly stated it was irregular and in fact went out of his or her way to state that it wasn't illegal. But the author did imply this was irregular and that was the basis for a sell or short thesis.What exactly is TWOU capitalizing? The following has been taken from the TWOU 10-K:Further…So does anybody read anything here that seems unusual? The fact that TWOU doesn't capitalize ALL of the content creation costs alone speaks to management and their integrity in showing as close to the actual operating results as possible. What do I mean by that? TWOU could have greatly reduced income statement expense results (I'll show this shortly) if it wanted to simply move all of these costs to the balance sheet as an asset. I didn't create the accounting rules and I don't always agree with them but this is one that I think is legitimate.Operating Leverage…With that in mind, the fact that the income statement could be made to look much better than it does realize that TWOU has been getting progressively more efficient and operating with more leverage every day since Day One. What does that mean? It means that by the nature of its model TWOU always has to spend a significant amount more up-front in expenses to launch a program and to maintain a program (sales and marketing expense is ongoing) than matching revenues that will be derived from the program until a certain breakpoint.That said, we know that cost per program decreases each month (as a percentage of revenues derived) after initial launch because the costs begin to be offset by revenues derived from each program. This is pretty simple to understand. This total cost drops to near zero after 3-4 years for primary programs and 12-15 months for secondary programs within a primary channel. After that costs become permanent negatives as the revenue derived from each program is greater and grows greater with each semester (see TWOU key metrics) than front-end costs. This becomes especially true when factoring in that the program ""refresh"" (essentially the signing of a new deal and the integration of up to date content) doesn't require a second set of implementation costs.With the program having already been sold to the university and having already been built-out infrastructurally there's no need for a second set of implementation expenses. Just a refresh of the software within the program and boom, you're on your way to higher margins. You can see how this makes for a big back-end margin model. This can also be called operating leverage. Operating leverage means that the operating and net loss become smaller as a percentage of revenues. That means higher margins. Operating leverage means that the top-line is continuing to grow or expenses are shrinking or that the top-line is outpacing the expenses. That is the case at TWOU and has been the case for a while now as TWOU isn't launching courses in the total size of the already launched base.For clarity, TWOU's already launched programs that have passed their ""breakeven"" points are flowing through to the model ""cost free"" revenues that in total have already encompassed all launch and integration and ongoing expenses. These ""leftover"" dollars can be used within the model to ""match"" new expenses being taken on by 1) increased sales and marketing efforts and 2) new program launches.In 2014 TWOU cut its operating loss ""margin"" by 840 bps Y/Y and it cut its net loss ""margin"" by 740 bps Y/Y. There was a point of spread from interest expense that caused the difference. In 2013 TWOU cut its operating loss ""margin"" by 760 bps Y/Y and its net loss ""margin"" by 770 bps Y/Y. Further, since 2012 TWOU has realized 1600 bps of operating margin and 1510 bps of net margin leverage. As TWOU continues to scale-up and continues to age it is my expectation that this leverage will accelerate into TWOU becoming profitable.Growing ""Cash Flows""…Another issue the PRO article author had with TWOU was its cash flows. Nothing is bearish about TWOU's cash flows. For the record, TWOU is a net outflow company both operationally and investment wise which is a fancy way of saying it burns cash currently.The good news is that TWOU's operational cash outflows have been shrinking for three years sequentially as it realizes operating leverage. Also good, TWOU's 2014 total cash run rate, all-in inclusive of investment outflows was ~$23 million.Yes this sure is quite a bit of cash burn but it's all relative to C&CE on hand to which TWOU had ~$87 million at year-end. To imply anything is even remotely concerning with regard to TWOU's cash flows is, in my opinion, inaccurate.Another good thing about TWOU's cash situation is that it appears as if no dilution is coming. Unless an entire conference of schools signs with TWO, which would move the share price meaningfully higher, TWOU has no need for a material portion of the cash already on its books.Finally, I should mention TWOU's contractual obligations going out as far as 60 months are not cash intensive:Where's the trade?...I believe the trade is to get long this name and stay long. TWOU hasn't been the smoothest ride I've ever been on but it has performed well over the duration of the hold. With the company's recent program integration plans with Yale and what would presumably be entry to other Ivy League schools I would imagine we see a considerable uptick to key metric line item ""average revenue per full course equivalent enrollment in our clients' programs"" permanently and sequentially. That's going to be a good thing for the stock.I also think we see some analyst upgrades (they've already started to come in a bit) as analysts are bullish this name across the board. It's not unusual for stocks like TWOU to outrun price targets and then for price targets to come around to higher pricing rather than the other way around. The point is to not think that the fact that TWOU is above analyst price targets is a ""sell"" signal. It isn't.Good luck everybody."

I continue to recommend this name and continue to be bullish on all durations. Shares of TWOU are up 31% since initiation of coverage in April of 2014.TWOU provides an online education platform that is cloud based that enables non-profit colleges and universities to launch greenfield online programs or to expand stage progression existing programs. Why does this matter? Because education is shifting more and more to an online base and TWOU has the analytics to drive that point home. TWOU essentially brings these antiquated institutions up to speed and opens up their revenue potential on a global basis. The institutions have taken notice and have rewarded TWOU with long term, high margin contracts - often ten years in length. They've also rewarded TWOU with contract expansions as they realize the effectiveness of the spend associated with TWOU's model. This has mattered in a big way as well.TWOU just reported full year revenue growth of 33%, flat GAAP net loss, 20% contraction to Adjusted net loss (this is a good thing), and 33% contraction to Adjusted EBITDA loss.I've detailed in previous articles now exclusive to the PRO platform how TWOU had evidenced two quarters ago that its model was already showing leverage and that profitability was inevitable. At scale already, I anticipate TWOU to continue to realize model leverage in the near term barring any major unseen greenfield launches. If you're asking me to pick between model leverage and new deals, where do I take net loss expansion?Actually, that's something that TWOU has been great at - constantly keeping the pipeline fresh and full. Here's a list of FY15 catalysts I put together for PRO readers back in August 2014:Yeah, this list should make sure to keep the bears in the front row as they continue to receive their education on shorting. 2014's full year lesson was to not short TWOU. Plenty of dunce cap wearing, dancing bears will learn this lesson in 2015.The bottom line is that TWOU is a best of breed provider in a lucrative, highly annuitized niche that is ripe for disruption. TWOU turns regional institutions into potential global players and it does it in a very accretive way for the institution.Consider buying TWOU. I expect big things in 2015."
3004446,48411,2015-03-16T13:59:31-04:00,TWOU might have just changed the education game with its Yale PR.Most importantly the PR detailed how a program historically capped to a once per year enrollment can now be rolled out three times per year.This is huge for not only TWOU's revenue generation but the university's as well.Look for this announcement to be one that is remembered years from now as one that generated more than just incremental revenue.Continue to be long TWOU.,"Shares of cloud based online education platform provider 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU) are up ~20% over the last 4 trading days on a huge PR detailing the company's entry into the Ivy Leagues. In light of this PR acting as a further confirmation of a long-standing bull thesis I continue to recommend readers own TWOU on all durations.TWOU is trading at all-time highs on the announcement that it has inked an agreement to ""partner with Yale University to launch an online Master of Medical Science (MMSc) degree for aspiring physician associates (PA), pending approval of the online program by the Accreditation Review Commission on Education for the Physician Assistant (ARC-PA) and various state licensing agencies (SOURCE: TWOU YALE PR)"".Among a handful of other reasons to be bullish TWOU this PR stands to be more than just an incremental revenue generator for the company longer term. I'll elaborate on the program details provided by CEO Chip Paucek, the most important of which is the following:This is huge.First, this allows the university to (at this point) potentially triple its revenues taken in from what have traditionally been ""capped"" disciplines. That alone is a clear, quantifiable value-add to Universities that weren't able to realize this prior to a program and delivery method as capable as that of TWOU. I believe this revenue extension capacity is the primary reason an institution of Yale's caliber was willing to ""experiment"" with an online education provider. TWOU is the perfect blend between not compromising the academic integrity of an institution's programs and allowing the institution to fully leverage its infrastructure into more dollars. If TWOU has shown anything in the early goings it's that educational institutions certainly care about taking in rising revenues.Second, this sets precedence for literally every other institution in the country to partner with TWOU and not have to justify how TWOU isn't going to detract from the educational quality of the program. If Yale didn't think TWOU would compromise a program, what could be presumed to be lesser standard educational facilities certainly can rest assured their program's integrity will remain intact.Third, I believe this provides a scalable expansion to any other disciplines that have traditionally been capped for enrollments and/or been forced into ""seasonal"" enrollments because of faculty constraints or physical infrastructure constraints. I could see this type of multi-enrollment program being rolled out to areas like nursing, high levels of computer science, etc. I think this opens the door to many, many more partnerships like this that TWOU can use to continue to drive key metrics higher and higher. I really think the market's reaction to this PR is appropriate.TWOU for a long time has been slept on in that I don't believe the market has front run its uber-high visibility of growth or that the market has valued TWOU correctly from a multiple standpoint based on its annuitized revenues base. I think TWOU could stand to be valued much, much higher and that this PR might just be the first time the market has taken notice and agreed.I continue to be long TWOU and continue to recommend a long position in the name. Shares are up 58% since initiation:Good luck everybody."
2413525,48411,2014-08-13T08:02:54-04:00,"TWOU could shut down operations, allow current students to be ""taught out"" of its programs, and be profitable.TWOU showed for the first time a decreasing of operating expenses as a percentage of revenues, a sure fire sign of the closing of the net loss gap.TWOU should soon begin to realize the benefits of economies of scale and a growing network effect - both good things for shareholders.","Every now and then over the course of time, after sifting through hundreds of stocks, you get lucky enough to find an underfollowed name that by sheer lack of market sex appeal is a diamond in the rough. 2014's diamond in my portfolio has to be 2U, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWOU). This company has been given no breaks from the market until recently and has had to fight for every penny of share price appreciation despite a very one-sided bull story that just now turned heads on The Street with Q2 announcements. Turn heads it did. With the announcements that it recently took a major step towards profitability - which was way ahead of schedule and in the face of quite a bit of skepticism - the shares have ripped higher each day prior to yesterday, on the reaction to a senseless downgrade from Goldman Sachs. This article will make the argument that based on recently announced financial developments, overall health and strength of program pipeline, a unique blending of accounting methods, and a high barrier to entry that TWOU is a strong buy candidate that is on the front end of a multi-year bull run. The shares, up substantially since IPO and up since my last continuing coverage article, continue to be undervalued.The Road Less TraveledFor those not familiar with the stock, I urge you to read any number of the articles listed under the ticker at SA. I also urge you to read my previous two articles so that you can follow my line of thinking and rationale as I may have just gotten lucky with this call. You definitely want to make sure you agree with me in my general thesis before purchasing at these prices as the stock is closing in on 52-week highs.That being said, a general description from my continuing coverage article ""2U, Inc. Remains On The Dean's List Of Steady Performing Stocks"":It's taken TWOU five years of pounding the pavement and value prop pitching to close 17 programs at 12 universities. For those of you reading this and thinking a bear case can be made using low barrier to entry, forget it. Despite a significant obvious need for online education platforms at universities and a clear lack of industry leader to turn to, most universities have required return trip after return trip before allowing TWOU a chance at a greenfield launch - initial program implementations at each school.Now that TWOU has overcome the initial barrier to entry, which was huge and set the table for the recent financial surprises, it appears to be cultivating a network effect with members of its initial ""Core Four"" programs who have moved to outside schools. Core Four programs are the initial four programs that TWOU had launched prior to 2013 and before that time derived substantially all of its revenue from. The TWOU story, while showing signs that it shouldn't be showing for at least another 12-18 months, is not a mature one. This company has just begun developing its market and its potential. What this has done is allowed for quicker contract closings and for in-the-door name recognition when TWOU makes a presentation. What does that do for cost per customer acquisition? Well, you can probably guess that it drives down the cost and expands back end margins. So that's the first part of the road less traveled that TWOU decided to embark down 5 years ago.The second part is a play on the network effect that TWOU has built. Sure, it has worked hard to build its current momentum that we'll get to in a bit. Sure, it has worked hard to create an administrator tree with which to call upon when administration members of the Core Four promoted to other opportunities. What doesn't get mentioned in research reports is that TWOU could have chosen a road that would have had it showing much closer to profitability day one, and most likely being profitable as of right now, but it didn't. It chose the road that required confidence and long-term vision to choose. It chose the accounting road that would have it see perpetual margin expansion if it could see success. It chose a road that would have its financial numbers turn a profitability corner and never turn back.Explaining what I'm talking about in detail requires a quick explanation of the accounting methodology used at TWOU. First, the company chooses to expense most costs as incurred - meaning on the front-end. This creates significant losses on the front-end of things like program implementation (from an infrastructural and hardware/software standpoint) and advertising program launches. TWOU could have capitalized both, especially the implementation, as a tangible asset and the advertising as an intangible asset and slowly depreciated and amortized the costs. It didn't. The company chose not to do this because it wanted to avoid anything pressing on margins down the road as it trusted the long-term visibility of revenues based on its ""subscription"" based model. When you expense major costs like this on the front end, if you can survive, the back end gets really attractive. Margins can expand perpetually as the maintenance costs are low when compared to the perpetual revenue stream coming in from the students' semester after semester. Other than content creation, which TWOU does capitalize as it wants to match the costs with revenues generated form the content, there are very little recurring costs. Even the content creation is sporadic in need as content (course content) generally only needs refreshing once every five years. That being said, TWOU has an immaterial amount of amortization each quarter coming from these capitalized costs - which matters because that is a major fixed cost that is unavoidable in this line of business. Controlling it is huge and TWOU has found a way to manage this cost as well as could be expected.What does this mean to investors? What it means is that at some point, and before this quarter that ""some point"" was a moving target, the base of launched programs and secondary programs stemming from those initial launches would be generating enough revenue to overcome front end costs of the recently implemented and newly implemented programs (read: losses) and show the first signs of operating loss shrinking as a percentage of revenues. That, my friends, is called watching the margins - not the profit margins but the margins of the growth curves. The great stuff happens on the margins; you want to be long companies that show a trend-line reversal on the far margins of the trend-line, especially when that trend line turns north. That's exactly what happened at TWOU during Q2.The FinancialsFor the second quarter in a row - the company has been public for two quarters - TWOU exceeded all financially guided metrics. This helps explain the recent share price performance.Now, TWOU has a history of being conservative with guidance and I noted that in my last article. Management has been able to do this because the market has had low expectations as sentiment has largely been bearish since the IPO and many of the analysts who cover the name had year end 2015 as a first checkpoint for profitability, not for profitability but as a checkpoint to be given guidance.I don't think management will have the luxury of low-balling numbers any longer. During Q2 TWOU saw 32.4% revenue growth Y/Y on the Q and 35% revenue growth on the 1H. Both figures were higher than I had modeled and higher than every single other analysts' models on the recent conference call. This was the result of quicker acceptance and deeper penetration for recently launched programs and more effective marketing as a result of increased effectiveness of TWOU's program selection and optimizing algorithm. Both of these factors that helped act as tailwinds for revenue growth should only grow larger over time.This is a huge reason to be bullish long-term. If TWOU can further cut corners on advertising due to a more efficacious program selection that would help reduce the largest recurring expense on the income statement. Why hasn't the company utilized this algorithm in the past? It has but because of a lack of scope of data the algo wasn't as effective as it is now and as it is trending to become in the future. This is something management is really excited about - the use of its analytics.Something else this analytical engine does is provide further evidence of the secondary barriers to becoming a defensible leader in the space - something TWOU definitely is. What I mean by that is that developing this space isn't simply selling the idea of a program implementation to administration and then having a program launch. The local cultures have to be willing to accept an online option as a way to achieve a degree and the acquisition of the students has to be economically plausible. Being able to select schools, having the analytics (whatever they may be) to be able to more accurately select low hanging opportunities increases chances of long-term company success and with that all the other intangibles that come with seeing success after success - brand recognition, trust from administration, brand equity with students, etc.I will be very closely watching the advertising spend figures for the new program to be launched at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas in January 15'. If TWOU can show less advertising spend and equal scheduled penetration that would be a reason for me to adjust my modeling of revenue growth higher and with that net loss lower. The SMU program is also TWOU's first in Texas and the Southwest so it'll be interesting to see if culturally the South will acclimate to an online program. I'm watching this launch as the biggest driver and indicator of mid-term revenue growth.The revenue growth wasn't the only sign of a changing direction of prevailing growth winds. As a matter of fact, it was what everything else did as a percentage of revenue that has The Street so bulled up:This graphic here will eventually be looked at as the graphic that helped TWOU show the world it was an inevitability that the company would become profitable. This was a monumental moment in company history. That is no exaggeration.Everything you want to see and take note of is in the middle columns, right hand side. The three month Y/Y comparison showed drops as a percentage of revenue for every single expense line item outside of G&A - which one would expect to increase as a percentage as the company continues to scale up and grow. This is the one line item that doesn't have to show trend line decreasing to still remain bullish. All of the other expense lines dropped in the quarter Y/Y pressuring the operating loss lower by 5.3%, and that line item falling is the smoking gun for profitability. The company is clearly growing the top-line faster than expenses and it is closing the loss gap. I can't tell you how big that is this early in development.Consider this: TWOU doesn't have a great economy of scale. Although it clearly has the base of launched programs implemented to provide the economy of scale needed to show an initial closing of losses, TWOU isn't anywhere close to the level of efficiency it should someday operate at (as its algo gets better so will efficiency), TWOU has presumably the smallest amount of brand recognition and equity that it will ever have going forward, and TWOU has to this point mostly focused on launching primary programs that have much lower front and back end margins. As TWOU matures, its financials should all accelerate positively. Revenue will grow as a whole in size, expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenue and with maturation they'll decrease in actual dollar amount as well because of the accounting methods used (described in the sections above), and cost per customer acquisition should begin to fall as the analytics used by the algo get more dialed in and as TWOU begins to further flex its networking muscle.Each quarter sequentially moving forward, now that TWOU has a larger base of launched and decreasing in aggregate cost programs in place, should show larger and larger drops from expenses as a percentage of revenue. (Remember cost per program decreases each month after initial launch because the costs begin to be offset by revenues derived from each program - this cost drops to zero after 3-4 years for primary programs and 12-15 months for secondary programs within a primary channel and after that costs become permanent negatives as the revenue derived from each program is greater, and grows greater with each semester, than front end cost.)These decreases come first because overall revenues will continue to expand with new program launches, historically larger enrollments at existing programs, and slight increases in tuition for existing programs; and second because previously launched programs expenses have already been accounted for on the front end and because advertising dollars can be spent in a more targeted, effective way. Unless TWOU comes up to a contract expiration (its contracts are between 10-15 years currently with its first contract expiration coming in late 2019) and loses a program the program launches will not outpace the programs in place.TWOU guided as much on a recent call listing the following schedule of launches heading into 2015:These launches, while important top-line drivers, will certainly have large front end expenses but not large enough to offset expenses rolling off the books from prior quarters. These programs should be the first to have a net positive effect on the company at launch stage. For clarity, what I mean is that the launch expenses for the following programs (because of the launch scheduling being so slow and well planned) should be swallowed up by revenues flowing in (essentially cost free) from TWOU's oldest programs at USC. It really helps from a modelling standpoint to think of the launches like that. The newest launches, from this point going forward, will offset by the oldest launches. This is expenses to revenues - the matching principle of accounting at its finest - only TWOU chose not to use the matching principle; its business model just worked out that way because of the consistency of its recurring revenues.Remember, one of the biggest benefits of owning TWOU's model is that it is not transaction-based and runs very little risk of becoming transactional. You're buying a ""subscription"" based model that has shown an inception to date retention rate of greater than 100% (shown below in a graphic in the conclusion of the article). Because TWOU chose not to use the matching principle (capitalizing costs to match revenues down the line as the revenues from those costs are derived) and instead paid the costs as they were incurred the oldest program can perpetually slide down the moving line to offset the newest programs expense. I hope that makes sense because that is the entire bull story going forward at TWOU. The financials above evidence this theory in execution. It helps to think of the new programs and old programs needing to find a dance partner for TWOU to be successful. TWOU needs the older programs revenues to ""dance"" with the newer programs expenses for those expenses to not show, really what I'm saying is not press down on the net loss line. This has just recently started with TWOU having more older programs than newer program dance partners. Excuse the simplicity of the metaphor but that's the best way I can describe how I have been modeling trend line projections since before the IPO.Also, this is a worst case scenario we're talking about here. Yes, the current scenario is the worst case scenario. You're looking at a company with no benefits outside of the benefits it has worked for. TWOU mentioned on its Q2 call that recently it has had the embarrassment of riches of having to turn down programs that were interested in implementing a greenfield because it didn't think the programs could maintain the level of service TWOU wants associated with its name. I'm betting and the Street appears to be betting now that it won't be long before quality programs, programs like the Northwesterns and SMU's that TWOU has already landed, begin calling in proactively. When that happens you're going to want to have a loaded boat of shares.Where's the trade?I know we spent the majority of this article discussing concepts rather than hard numbers but the hard numbers really speak for themselves. Not much explanation was needed outside of showing that expenses were decreasing as a percentage of revenues. That's accounting/business/trading 101. They also weren't doing that as a result of anything quirky like as sudden decrease in stock based comp or anything else that would be considered one-time. They were doing it because a company finally made the jump from growing losses to shrinking them. Getting to be along for the ride has been a pleasure.As bulled up as I am, The Street is on board but they aren't foaming at the mouth yet.Analyst Ratings:These price targets imply between a 7-18% share price appreciation. I think TWOU can do a midpoint to that between now and its next earnings, which will be the final continuing coverage article for 2014. As I was last quarter, I am expecting TWOU shares to appreciate on a mixture of technical and fundamental developments another 10-15% by Q3 EPS announcements.I also am expecting the company to once again exceed revenue guidance, which for Q3 is $26.6-$27.3MM and to exceed Adjusted net loss guidance, $7.3MM-$6.7MM. I've just grown to trust management and to expect them to be able to hit or beat the targets they give out.Again, TWOU has shown the right mixture of long-term vision and short term metric hitting to warrant a long position that can be left alone or actively managed.Retention rates, growing enrollments and revenue per enrolled student, decaying on-book expenses, and low overhead make TWOU a great buy and hold on all durations.I recommend a buy for anybody looking to add a fast growing company who is further developing its leadership position.Good luck to all.Disclosure: The author is long TWOU.

3044546,62963,2015-04-02T07:42:21-04:00,"Free cash flows is a useful measure to assess 2U, Inc.2U has substantial negative free cash flows.2U appears overvalued relative to peers.","In the most recent Pacific Crest Emerging Technology Summit, 2U, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TWOU) Chief Financial Officer Cathy Graham stated she believes TWOU will be EBITDA-positive and cash flow-positive by 2017, and went on to say EBITDA margins north of 30% should be sustainable longer term.In this article, I will review the likelihood of this actually happening and additionally discuss why TWOU is a short.Accounting Shenanigans and getting to EBITDA-positive by 2017Capitalized content development expenditures is an interesting item you will find in TWOU's financial results, specifically in the cash flow statement. For the 2014 Financial Year, this amounted to $7.15 million.So What? By choosing to capitalize this entry and not expense immediately, a couple of things happen.Obviously, TWOU is doing all this legally and is working toward their 2017 goal of being EBITDA and cash flow positive. Given the use of capitalized expenditures, the best and most accurate way to assess TWOU is using free cash flow.How does TWOU's free cash flows compare to other cloud-based software companies? I have selected two successful companies that are free cash flow positive, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Cornerstone on Demand (NASDAQ:CSOD). CSOD makes for a good comparison as it's a small company and similar to TWOU, CSOD capitalizes some expenses, such as software costs.As the table shows, both CRM and CSOD generate positive free cash flow and TWOU has significant negative free cash flow. For fast growing cloud companies, free cash flow is an important ingredient to allow them to continue to allocate capital and grow. With $87 million in cash, TWOU will need to improve their free cash flows or will need to tap the market for an equity raising. Given the huge run up in the stock price, I wouldn't be surprised if a secondary offering is on the cards.Valuation is stretchedTWOU trades at nearly 7 times next year's revenues; this is a substantial premium to CSOD and a premium to CRM. Both CRM and CSOD generate positive free cash flow. TWOU has claimed they will be EBITDA and cash flow positive by 2017, but the metric that really matters as a result of TWOU capitalizing content costs is free cash flow. As it stands, TWOU has substantial negative free cash flow and the market is ignoring this, rather than factor this into the share price.Small Market OpportunityTWOU has created a lot of hype for investors; their S-1 suggests the higher education market is $550 Billion in the United States alone. Such a bold and unsubstantiated statement reminds me of the Castlight Health (NYSE:CSLT) S-1 which stated $3.1 trillion will be spent on US healthcare in 2014, with $620 Billion spent by employers. CSLT has crashed since their IPO with the stock down 80%.TWOU can only tap into the online education market and can only tap into the US market. The online education market is very competitive with primary competitors EmbanetCompass and Deltak. In addition, colleges and universities may choose to continue using or develop their own online learning solutions in-house, rather than pay for TWOU solutions.Cathy Graham, Chief Financial Officer mentioned on the recent Pacific Crest conference that TWOU may have trouble becoming an international company as the funding and reimbursements internationally will make some international markets uneconomical.Source: HESA Global Higher Education Rankings 2010Based on the above table, USA has the highest education cost globally and is clearly an important market for TWOU. Outside of the USA, I'd expect only Japan and Australia have high enough education costs to warrant TWOU entering these markets. This should be a clear message to investors that the TWOU market opportunity is overstated and will struggle to scale outside of the USA.The market isn't factoring TWOU scaling limitations and is valuing TWOU above its peers. Peers such as CRM and CSOD are truly international companies with significant global opportunity ahead.ConclusionAt a current valuation of 7 times forward sales, TWOU is priced for perfection. TWOU has a long road ahead to achieve their EBITDA and cash flow forecasts. In light of TWOU's appalling free cash flow position, investor caution is warranted. Peers such as CSOD and CRM offer better value, have diversified international businesses and generate substantial free cash flow."

2274963,48411,2014-06-19T11:48:49-04:00,TWOU is a name that should be on your watch list from a technical and fundamental standpoint.TWOU's business model is highly recurring and doesn't run the risk of becoming transactional at any point - which is great news for investors.TWOU's entry into the international markets was a welcomed surprise and could lead to other positive surprises between now and Q2 reporting.,"In late March I wrote an article about an SaaS company going public that I thought based on its recurring revenue based model could be an attractive set and forget opportunity going forward. 2U, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWOU) has not disappointed over the last three months even in what was most recently a volatile market environment, one that was particularly unkind to currently unprofitable SaaS companies.If you're unfamiliar with the story at TWOU, that article and the other articles under the ticker are worth a read because I again would state that this company has a very attractive value prop to both investors and prospective clients - which typically means good things for the company's stock. TWOU's shares most recently settled at $14.61 giving the shares an IPO to date performance of 12.38%.This continuing coverage article will make the argument that based on the company's highly predictable and highly visible business model, the industry in which the company operates, the long-term nature of the contracts and recognition of revenues, and the still untapped verticals of the existing business that the stock is in the early stages of a multi-year bull run that will experience significantly less volatility than the broader indexes.TWOU's Business Model: A Model of ConsistencyAs a quick refresher, TWOU operates an online education platform that focuses on offering the exact same education to students that would be offered in the classroom. Believe it or not, many major universities do not currently have an online education platform in place. These so called ""greenfield"" opportunities have become the metals which with TWOU has built its foundation of revenues dating back to its initial offering at the University of Southern California in 2009. As time has passed TWOU has been able to acquire outside universities, multiple disciplines within existing universities, and further disciplines within existing programs - all adding to the base of consistent revenue derivation at the company.TWOU has made incredible progress into being able to prove that its model has extremely high visibility of revenues; the company typically signs 10-15 year contracts with universities and keeps ~65% of the tuitions charged to students within its online platform, while its industry in nature is predictable as well. This combination, along with TWOU's management's conservative guidance and ability to constantly hit stated checkpoints has driven the stock higher and higher and has The Street excited about the future. In its most recent quarter TWOU exceeded all internal estimates including top-line revenue and full course equivalents.TWOU also has been able to prove that the consistency in slope-lines of growth towards profitability, on a program specific level, is an asset that should be valued by investors. TWOU's initial programs launched in 2009 have recently become adjusted EBITDA positive (as modeled and projected by management) and those programs were at a lower average revenue share than the most recent programs being launched, which should work to drive down the average break-even time of the newer programs. Additionally, TWOU management has expressed and been able to demonstrate these results on paper, that its programs typically become profitable ~3-4 years into implementation and reach max profitability (expected) ~6 years into implementation. Obviously these numbers are based off of a smaller sample size than ideal but the early going seems to validate the projections. Finally, in regard to program profitability and program launching, TWOU expects to launch four new programs per year going forward, with additional discipline launches not being factored into that number (read: potential outperformance of that number).The high visibility of the model at TWOU along with the demonstration of the models theories in practice has provided a base-line for the stock and company valuation.Improving FinancialsNow, understanding that there exists a significant lag-time of program launch to program profitability but that the slope-line of growth towards profitability is gentle and predictable, you would expect the front-end costs of implementing a program to overwhelm the revenues being derived from the program itself for the first few years (as expressed) and the expenses in aggregate on a company wide basis to overwhelm aggregate revenues. This is what is happening currently at TWOU.Even though the company has historically operated at a loss, with those losses most recently being to flatten off as the base of revenues has grown Y/Y/Y, The Street has not punished the TWOU shares because of the above talked about ease of understanding and visibility of the model.You'll notice the very consistent, very rapid growth of top-line revenues dating back to 2011 with the total costs growing as well. It's important to keep the revenues and expenses in separate mental columns when looking at the TWOU income statement. For clarity, remember that revenues always operate, at least historically, on an upward slope-line with the slope-line flattening between year 3 and 4 and peaking at year 6, at which point the program has reached max profitability.The expenses always, historically, operate on a downward slope-line with the slope being affected by whether or not the program in question is a secondary program at an existing university, is a secondary discipline within an existing program, and with the revenue sharing agreement at the particular university - but the expenses are never higher than at implementation. So, always keep in mind that the increased expenses, those same expenses that are dragging the top-line results down and hurting the bottom line, are essentially just future revenues in drag. As strange as that is to read, it's true. The CAPEX spent at TWOU, historically, always becomes revenues as per the schedule listed above.That's the concept that is the straw that stirs the TWOU revenue drink. The company could stop spending money right now, rest on its current programs and eventually reach profitability. Obviously, this isn't something the company would do but it recently expressed as much on the Q1 conference call. Just based on the slope-lines of revenues and expenses that is a realistic possibility at any point in time and that has to matter from a fundamental valuation standpoint. The model is rock solid and the execution of the model is just as good.TWOU's most recent quarter shows the same level of consistency in results as the historic financials.You have a net loss that is on pace with FY historic results but a revenue number that is growing at a faster than historic pace. This dynamic is continuing to be driven by the underlying model of heavy front-end CAPEX and slow trickle in revenues.The company recently guided on its Q1 call that it expects Q2/14 revenue to be between $23-$24 million (seasonal decline in revenues during its worse seasonal Q) and FY14 revenues to be between $104.5-$107.5 million, which would be a huge increase over FY13's ~$84 million print. TWOU is also expecting a FY14 net loss of $31-$33 million which would be an incremental increase in FY loss over FY13 as well. To put the revenues and losses into context, TWOU is expecting mid-point FY14 Y/Y revenue growth of ~26% and mid-point net loss growth of ~14%, which considering what those losses really are is a result those long the stock will gladly take.The revenues TWOU is expecting to generate, and I'll take management at their word but they have a history of being conservative with guidance, are coming from very dependable sources as evidenced by the graphic above. Historically and recently, the company has an excellent track record of retaining revenues. This again speaks to the visibility of FY projections by management and should allow the company as a whole to plan accordingly when it comes to cash flow generation.The statement of cash flows itself makes the most recent quarter much less concerning to a person considering a long position and helps better explain why the stock has moved higher in the face of growing losses (outside of the understanding that today's expenses become tomorrow's revenues).First, the company was actually cash flow positive on an operational basis both during Q1/13 and during the recent quarter. While I do think it's a bit strange to see that large a build in accounts payable (skews the cash flow of operations to the positive as that money has to exit at some point) I like that when subtracting items that have nothing to do with the actual business (stock based comp, change in value of warrants, depreciation and amort, etc) that the company did add to cash from operations.Second, the company received no cash flow offset increase from financing and showed a negative on the investing line - which shows they didn't slow CAPEX during the quarter to slow cash burn or inflate its cash decrease with a raise of any sort. That's important to me, being a believer of the business model, in that I want to see CAPEX continue to drive future revenues. It also speaks to management's confidence in the model and in that they believe that in the future they'll have access to financing opportunities, which aren't a concern at this point considering the cash on hand and the credit facilities available to the company currently. Overall, I'm encouraged by TWOU's total cash burn for the quarter of $1.31 million which is what really matters at this stage of development - maximizing growth per real dollar, not driving growth of a made up line item at the bottom of an income statement. It should also be noted that if TWOU didn't have to pay a deferred cost of its IPO offering, and they rightly so had to pay that cost because it wasn't reflected in previous cash flow statements, that the company would have been cash flow positive for the quarter. I really can't tell you how impressive that would have been while not doing a raise and while not slowing CAPEX.Where's the trade?Technically, I like what I'm seeing from TWOU. After bouncing hard off some unjustified lows, lows that were put in as the market was tossing out the baby with the bath water, the stock has been on a tear and is staring its 52 week highs in the eyes.I think the stock will continue to run into the quarterly announcement and that The Street will be looking for the numbers to fall within guidance with another excellent showing on the cash flow statement. If this happens, I see the stock rising another 10-15% from now until after Q2 EPS. Some of that projection is technically based, some is fundamentally based.I think that TWOU will continue to benefit long-term from its growing network effect. Its recent addition of a program at Syracuse was its shortest contract negotiation and sales cycle since inception - thanks in no small part to the dean of the school in which TWOU landed the program coming from a school in which the company was already doing business. That network effect will help in driving down costs per customer acquisition long-term. That is huge because we already know that historically speaking the programs will reach profitability with time and a lower acquisition costs will help to expand margins and shorten the duration to profitability.Anything TWOU can do in the interim to provide surprises to the upside should be looked at as icing on a well done cake. For instance, TWOU expressed at IPO that international expansion was in the long-term growth strategy but that they had no contracts in talks and no intentions of expanding internationally during the shorter term. TWOU recently announced its first international program as a joint venture between Washington University in St. Louis and Tecnologico de Monterrey, another great example of how management is either extremely conservative with guidance or how they always seem to be able to pull the rabbit out of the hat.TWOU to me represents an opportunity to buy a strong growth name in an industry that has excellent demographics and organic growth. I like them as an add to most portfolios but especially portfolios that are looking for a low maintenance name that can be left alone for a few years. I look forward to providing updates in the future. Good luck to all.Disclosure: The author is long TWOU. The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.

2275683,64163,2014-06-18T17:34:58-04:00,"2U offers a cloud-based solution to online education and has partnered with numerous universities.The company has seen consistent revenue growth, which will allow it to expand and continue developing new technologies.Online education is a growing field that offers specialized programs and counters the increasing costs of a college education.","With the cost of obtaining a college education becoming more and more expensive each year, educators and students are beginning to turn to online education as a solution for this problem. Over the past few years, we have seen many prominent universities such as Harvard, MIT, and Stanford partner with websites such as Coursera and Udemy in an attempt to deliver free educational content to the masses. 2U (NASDAQ:TWOU), still in its infancy stage in the markets, enhances the general idea behind these sites by providing real-time education to students through its unique online campus environment. This intuitive platform is thus cost-effective for both students and educators, as the former is able to receive high-quality education, and the latter is able to reach out to more potential students than they normally would.Source: BloombergBackgroundAs my educational studies class discussed this past semester, public opinion of online education currently fluctuates from being seen as a legitimate way to receive schooling and a substandard educational method. However, what many people fail to address when discussing online education is that in most cases, its most successful programs are specifically tailored for certain groups of students and are not intended to appeal to the masses. Although there are numerous programs that offer a variety of full-degree options such as University of Phoenix, some of the most highly-renowned programs that have seen tremendous success in the online sphere over the years are specialized, including the many online MBA programs that are seen at prestigious schools such as Kelley and the Columbia Business School. 2U expands on this idea by working with other graduate programs around the country, and its impressive list includes USC's School of Education, Georgetown's School of Nursing, Newhouse at Syracuse, and Kenan-Flagler at UNC.The company IPOed on March 28th of this year and is currently up just over 4% from its IPO price. Initial concerns surrounding its IPO mainly stemmed from its current inability to generate a profit. However, as demonstrated by its new partnership with Syracuse, the company is looking towards long-term expansion in an attempt to move into the black in future years.The platform aims to deliver a real-time solution to online education by truly mirroring the experience one would receive in an actual classroom setting. Coursework is uniquely designed to be high-quality and engaging, classes are taught in real-time in small numbers by university professors to stimulate and enhance discussion, and classes even enforce the idea of immersion and applying knowledge through guided practice in real-world experiences. The last point is particularly significant. Since practically all of its current programs are set at the graduate level, students are at the stage at which they should be taking their experience and applying it out in the real world. In the USC Master of Arts in Teaching program, for example, enrolled students work together with mentor-teachers and submit videos of themselves instructing middle and high school classrooms for peer and professor evaluation. This allows students to work together by analyzing teaching methods taken from original content examples. 2U's approach to online education, as a whole, sets it apart from other similar platforms, giving it a unique edge in this rapidly growing field. The company has received much recognition, and Marilyn Flynn of USC's School of Social Work and 2U CEO Chip Paucek commented on this in a recent company news release:FinancialsRevenue for Q1 2014 increased 37% year-over-year from $19.1 million to $26 million, beating consensus revenue estimates by over $1 million. However, the company still finds itself unable to turn a profit, with a negative net income of $7.1 million and a profit margin of -26.77% for the first quarter of this year. However, that is expected for a company that is still in its infancy stage. Fortunately, as revenue continues to increase with each quarter, it is a clear sign of demand from educational institutions across the country. In order to meet this demand, the company will have to increase its spending on technology and developing new relationships and partnerships with schools around the world. It has already made signs of doing this, as its 2013 form S-1 notes that technology and content development costs were $19.5 million in 2013 compared to only $8.3 million in 2012. Program marketing and sales expense increased 19.2% from $45.4 million in 2012 to $54.1 million in 2013. Looking at its balance sheet, 2U has $5.7 billion in assets and no debt. While the company may not turn a profit in the short run, it is a very viable long-term solution for keen and astute investors.Revenue GenerationThe company makes money by obtaining revenue from long-term contracts, usually running between 10 and 15 years. These contracts allow schools to use the company's cloud-based technology and control it themselves or have 2U behind the entire operation. The company gets a percentage of what each university receives from its program's tuition fees and 2U submits invoices the universities based on enrollment reports. The company states in its S-1 that all of its clients have remained active, indicating very little concern for its contracts disappearing. The company's major source of revenue comes from USC, but it has expanded its client list significantly over the past few years, with its most recent partnership being with Syracuse's business program and its top-ranked communications school. Recently, 2U has also enabled cross-university courses, allowing students to take classes at other schools that operate under the platform. There will be over 50 courses across nine degree programs that will be available for cross-university functionality, and the schools themselves will determine enrollment eligibility. Total enrollment under 2U has grown from 14,000 in 2011 to just over 30,000 in 2013.Investment Risks and CompetitionThe primary investment risk to be seen with the company is that it lacks any patents. Yes, the company has copyrights on its labels and overall brand. It has its own unique and distinguishable business strategy that allows it to create its own market. But without any patents, it means that its business is open to be copied by anyone. Any company can begin doing what 2U is doing and partner with major universities around the world, creating formidable competition for the company over time. However, the company has received much praise and is clearly at the very top of its field. The Technology Council of Maryland even named 2U the ""Technology Firm of the Year for EdTech Innovation"" this past May.Its other challenges generally all derive from its ability to partner with more universities around the world. Obstacles that can get in the way of this include a negative perception of online education, damages to its existing clients' reputations, as well as inefficient use of its marketing efforts by targeting the wrong universities. 2U wants selective schools with top-ranked programs in their fields to become its major partners, as seen from its existing list of clients.Its main competitors are EmbanetCompass, which is owned by Pearson (NYSE:PSO) and Deltak, which is owned by John Wiley & Sons (NYSE:JW.A), both of which are large education companies that have existed for many years. Although 2U is a newcomer to the stage, its competitive advantage lies in its ability to capture and fully realize the potential of enrolled students. Its competition is mainly driven by solutions that emphasize redesigning content and creating programs to build successful online classes. 2U accomplishes this but also pushes out other factors such as real-world experiences and social engagement, both of which help students thrive post-graduation. There do not seem to be any major looming threats from its competition.Future GrowthGoing forward, the contracts that it has drawn up with its existing partners will create a steady source of revenue for the company while it continues to expand its operations and develop its technology. This will not only make the experience much more intuitive for its existing partners, but also help to attract new partnerships with other universities. With more universities being involved in the mix, the company will have more marketing power to continue expanding and eventually turn a profit. While for the most part the company only offers graduate-level coursework (only one program is offered at the undergraduate level), 2U acknowledges that it plans to widen its presence in undergraduate, doctoral, and international levels. In addition, with the growing trend of the continued increase of cloud technology across numerous sectors, the company will benefit, as this technology is what its platform is based on.RecommendationsLooking at analyst opinions, Oppenheimer, Needham, and Compass Point all initiated ""Buy"" or ""Outperform"" recommendations in April. Even Goldman Sachs recommends a ""Buy"" position with a $17 price target.Source: BloombergConclusion2U is a very viable long-term play that is at the forefront of the growing field of online education. The company has consistent top-line growth, offers an innovative solution to online education through cloud-based technologies, and has a revenue structure that allows it to continue creating new technologies and develop relationships with other schools. As the company only began publicly trading this past March, it's still very new, but if 2U can execute effectively on its business model and plans, investors should look forward to seeing future growth.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in TWOU over the next 72 hours.

The company's platform enables institutions to offer students instructor-led courses in alive setting along with social networking and other educational resources via web-based and mobile applications. Numerous universities already offer graduate degree programs via TWOU's solutions, the University of Southern California, including Georgetown University, UC Berkeley, and UNC Chapel Hill. Full-course equivalent enrollments in TWOU-enabled programs have grown from 14,099 in calendar 2011 to 31,338 in calendar 2013.TWOU primarily generates revenue via long-term contracts (approximately 10-15 years, initially) for a specified share of the tuition and fees that the firm's clients receive from students enrolled in TWOU-enabled programs.See our IPO preview of TWOU for additional details.Competition: External Firms, In-House ProvidersTWOU faces competition from other providers of online education solutions services, such as Embanet Compass (recently acquired by Pearson (NYSE:PSO)), and Deltak (recently acquired by John Wiley & Sons (JW/A)). TWOU also competes with in-house solutions developed by colleges and universities. Some of these competitors have access to greater financial or technical resources than TWOU.Management: Experience in For-Profit Ed SectorChristopher Paucek co-founded TWOU and has served as the firm's CEO since January 2012; he previously served as the firm's President and COO. He also served as the CEO of Smarterville Inc. and as vice president of business development and president of Educate Products for Educate Inc. Mr. Paucek holds a B.A. from The George Washington University and is currently enrolled in the TWOU's MBA@UNCprogram at the UNC Kenan-Flagler Business School of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.Evidence That Lockup Expirations Offer Short Opportunities Empirical studies published by researchers at the University of South Florida, University of Kentucky, and other academic institutions (Bradley, Jordan, Roten, and Ha-Chin Yi) have found that, on average, there is an association between lockup expirations and significant abnormal negative returns, as the sudden increase in the supply of publicly tradable TWOU shares (a potential tripling, per a 2001 NYU study) typically leads to a drop in share prices; a joint study from Duke's Fuqua School of Business and Harvard Business School finds that this drop in price is approximately 2%.Losses are often concentrated in firms with venture capital (VC) backing. In the Journal of Finance (2001), Professors Gordon Hanka and Laura Casares Field note that these losses are three times greater in VC-backed firms. Our firm has found returns around the IPO lockup expiration to be more volatile for VC-backed companies than for PE-backed companies. We also discovered that certain VC firms stand out as having greater negative returns around expiration for companies they backed. These firms include: New Enterprise Associates, Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield & Byers, Third Rock Ventures, Polaris Ventures, ARCH Venture Partners, and Flagship Ventures. Returns were unremarkable for any of the specific PE companies observed. The VC-company specific element is an interesting lead for further examination, but at present it is not something on which to draw conclusions.Our analysis of a sample of 242 companies with lockup expirations in 2013 and in the first six months of 2014, suggests that the most significant negative returns (-5.5%) appear during the Day (-11, +9) period before and after the lockup event (Day 0). These negative returns occur in tech firms that have not completed secondary offerings and whose share prices have increased from IPO to Day (-11) from the conclusion of the lockup period.Thus, the lockup expiration event will often generate a short opportunity for aggressive investors.Price Decline, Following Strong August TWOU's IPO priced at the high end of its expected price range at $13 per share and made a small 7.5% return in its first day of trading. The stock fluctuated between $11 and $17 per share for several months before posting strong gains in August to close at $19.94 per share on August 25. The stock has lost some ground in early September to close at $15.79 per share on September 10th.(Nasdaq.com)Conclusion: Short-Term Trading Opportunity Though TWOU has performed relatively well on the market since its IPO, the stock's struggles in early September-and particularly its heavy venture capital backing-lead us to believe that it will likely suffer a significant loss in share value with the conclusion of the quiet period.Nonetheless, we believe that this stock could merit investor interest moving into the future, given its established relationships with major academic institutions and the increasing demand for online education.At present, we envision a short-term price decline.We invite readers wishing to join the discussion on IPO lockup expirations to click the +FOLLOW button above the title of this article, and those looking for the latest updates to click +Get real-time alerts."
2152743,25120,2014-04-22T03:45:40-04:00,Fast-growing SaaS education business provider is demonstrating accelerating top-line growth.Losses are stabilizing which should be comforting to investors.I need to see more improvements before investing in the business.,"2U (NASDAQ:TWOU) provides cloud-based SaaS solutions targeted at non-profit colleges and universities to deliver education to students at a distance. The fast-growing business only recently made its public offering which showed solid demand for the company's shares.Very strong revenue growth is accompanied by stabilizing losses which shows the potential for the firm in a growing education market which is being provided through online channels.The Public Offering2U offers an online learning platform accompanied by related technology for colleges and universities to provide enrolling, education, support and graduation solutions to make the learning experience similar to on-campus offerings. Some of the offerings include the online campus platform which allows for online content management, an application process portal and customer relationship management, among others.2U sold 9.2 million shares for $13 apiece, thereby raising roughly $120 million in gross proceeds. The company itself sold 8 million shares and raised $104 million in proceeds before costs while selling shareholders offered the remainder of the shares.The offering was strong as bankers and the firm aimed to sell shares in a preliminary $11-$13 price range. Solid demand for the shares allowed for the sale at the high end of the range.Some 24% of the total shares outstanding were offered in the public offering. Trading at little above $13 in the weeks following the public offering 2U is valued at roughly $510 million.The major banks that brought the company public were Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Oppenheimer, Needham & Co and Pacific Crest Securities.Valuation2U offers a flexible platform allowing schools to offer a high-quality educational content from a distance. Clients enrolled more than 31,000 full-course equivalent courses at the end of 2013, demonstrating the success of 2U's approach. As students can of course follow multiple courses at the same time this implies than roughly 8,500 individuals have enrolled as a student and used 2U's solutions to date.2U has enrolled eight major clients including well-known educational institutions like the University of California, Berkeley.Revenues for the year of 2013 came in at $83.1 million which is up by 48.8% on the year before. Losses expanded alongside revenue growth increasing towards $28.3 million for the past year.2U held roughly $7 million in cash ahead of the offering while having no debt outstanding. On top of this comes the gross proceeds of $104 million resulting in a net cash position of roughly $100 million after the offering. This values operating assets at around $410 million, the equivalent of roughly 5 times annual revenues.Investment ThesisAs noted above, the offering of 2U was a modest success after the firm priced shares at the high end of the preliminary offering range, with shares being sold 8.3% above the midpoint of the preliminary range. Shares quickly gained ground to levels around $16 per share in the days following the offering but later settled around $13 per share.Investors might be attracted to 2U's impressive growth rates despite increasing losses. Revenue growth for the entire year of 2013 has been impressive, yet fourth-quarter revenue growth actually accelerated with revenues increasing by 51.1% to $24.8 million. This growth is supported by solid market fundamentals as online activities become more important in the higher education system in the future.Investors are also comforted by the fact that relative losses are narrowing, with absolute losses stabilizing in the fourth quarter on an annual basis. The long contracts with its clients which often last 10-15 years result in reliable long-term cash flows although the concentration of clients could be a worry.I believe 2U offers interesting solutions as it shows solid growth, while losses are stabilizing. The key dependency on some of its clients is a risk, although a new contract win could be a major boost to the business itself given the fact that contracts are typically large.Despite these promising developments the company does not meet my investment criteria. I am awaiting further narrowing losses and proof of more sustainable top-line growth before considering making an investment in 2U.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

2662255,48411,2014-11-11T07:00:00-05:00,"TWOU has shown that it is moving closer to profitability way ahead of schedule and this is while executing its growth strategy.
        TWOU is continuing to see the benefits of its network effect, look for this to continue to contribute to results going forward.
        TWOU should see higher highs as even ""business as usual"" should continue to move share prices.","This will be my final article for 2U, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWOU) for calendar 2014, with the exception of some completely unexpected development taking place, and with that I'll provide a bit of a summary of operations since the TWOU IPO, a breakdown of the Q3 and 9 months results, and some growth drivers for the near-term. I'm very thankful to SA for allowing me to provide continuing coverage of this name as it's been an excellent performer in my portfolio and writing coverage articles has allowed me to put my thesis in words, forcing me to weigh risk adjusted ownership of the stock time and time again.With that said, this continuing coverage article will again recommend a long position - my fourth long recommendation since the IPO, and will express the idea that TWOU is probably best accumulated in a dollar cost average purchase cadence. Shares have moved to higher highs as the year has progressed but there has certainly been a fair amount of volatility along the way. I remain bullish TWOU on all durations.No Back RowThe following excerpt describing TWOU's operations has been taken from a previous article of mine:TWOU has leveraged its five years of relationship building and platform integration into several both financial and non-financial benefits that have helped shape the overall TWOU fundamental picture. Some of the key summary items for TWOU include:Overall, the bullet points listed are the primary reasons that I remain bullish TWOU on all durations and are the reasons that I think TWOU has been able to exceed guidance given each quarter since IPO. I find the actual accounting momentum still being driven by operations in 2009 to be a huge positive and huge reason to own the stock. As the company matures this momentum should grow and the growing margin contributions from older programs should accelerate as a percentage of total revenues. This should help put a floor on revenues and keep a ceiling off margins longer term. Shorter term, it should simply help prop the income statement and provide cash flow for operations.The Educating of the BearsI'm not sure why those who are bearish TWOU, including Goldman Sachs who senselessly downgraded the shares in mid-August at then all-time highs, are or could have ever been bearish but I think they've received a world class education via a TWOU SAAS Pain Trade. TWOU operations have been solid since inception and the accounting machine it has created is very hard to dent in a single quarter or even a few quarter of slow launches. It also doesn't help bears that the one thing that could slow operational health and growth, canceling of programs or slow growth of implementations, are both guided out for progress years in advance. TWOU's first contracts up for cancellation become eligible in 2019 and TWOU has guided a full, full year slate of program launches out as far as 2016. If you're trying to build a bear case on either of those you might want to go back to the blackboard (pun well intended). It also doesn't really make sense to think that TWOU will see any level of program attrition considering many of the programs with primary implementations have or plan to have secondary implementations - essentially endorsing TWOU and expressing a level of happiness. Again, more reasons to feel like TWOU should be able to move higher as time goes on.Getting to the results from the first nine months of 2014, TWOU has been business as usual all year. With that being said and the fact that most of the operations are as vanilla as can be I'll breakdown the first nine months with a series of graphics and short explanations:Balance Sheet Strength:Clearly the balance sheet has seen improvement since the IPO. CC&E has grown substantially and this is during a period of time that is particularly a low cash month in TWOU's business because of the timing of academic calendars and how the company collects relative to the calendars. When taking a comprehensive look at changes in cash, AR and DR the balance sheet positioning looks even stronger. The spread between total assets and liabilities is huge, although it will show a marked shrinking soon with the launching of several programs, and the capitalization is absolutely clean. This is exactly what a bull would want to see when looking at a balance sheet.One item to note in regards to the balance sheet and it's really more of a note to the AR line is that TWOU currently has a good amount of concentration ""risk"" should any of its Core Four programs cancel (not likely at all based on the above detailing of secondary launches at most of the disciplines). Again, this is not something I'm considering a near term risk or concern with the nearest cancellation possibility being in 2019:Operational Strength:Most of the figures here are elementary when it comes to analysis so I won't waste much time here other than stating that revenue growth remains strong, although it is subscription based and large fluctuations up or down wouldn't be noticeable in a period to period comparison outside of a full year comparison, and that expenses have continued to grow with new implementations. It is interesting and very important to note that the net loss barely grew during the 9 month Y/Y comparison, which is incredible considering the new implementations, and that's entirely a result of the summary bullet points listed in the intro of the article. TWOU is paying less for the same amount of revenue generation as time goes on. Call it becoming more efficient, call it TWOU's program/advertising selection algorithm (detailed in previous articles) becoming more effective, or call it the total contributing effect of the accounting momentum but whatever you call it the chart says it means higher highs are ahead. By the way, don't forget that TWOU showed $3.4 million in share based comp expense increases in the comparable period or it would have beaten Y/Y on the loss from operations and the bottom line. Bears beware.When backing out the share based comp and a few other line items that are non-operational in nature and more accounting based, we can see that TWOU did in fact move closer to profitability of actual operations in that is showed an improved Adjusted EBITDA Y/Y - this was unexpected and was also way ahead of schedule:Providing the final source of evidence of operational progress towards profitability and perfectly illustrating the momentum of the accounting machine that TWOU's model has become, the line items form the income statement showed improvements (up and down respective of directions that show improvements) when looking at them as a percentage of revenue:Just to highlight a few of the particularly impressive lines for the Y/Y comparison of the 9 months ended 9/30/2014:Finally, we have an internal look at TWOU's health and operations:TWOU showed yet another comparison period with over 100% revenue retention rate (not listed) and showed growth in full course equivalent enrollments and average revenue per FCE. The revenue line item will fluctuate from period to period depending on the courses enrolled and the weighting of those courses across the platform so I'm not sure that this is a particular metric that needs tracked but it was nice to see a slight uptick.Where's the trade?I think TWOU is one of the few trades that had an IPO in calendar 2014 that are going to be long-term holds that you don't even really need to watch outside of earnings periods. The accounting machine that has been built and that has shown to be well oiled should take care of itself and unless some type of completely unknown variable is introduced simply business as usual at TWOU should be able to drive results.TWOU's pipeline is full for the next two years, has been announced, and will continue to drive results. TWOU has no retention issues to worry about for at least 5 years, has a falling cost per customer acquisition costs, is moving closer to profitability ahead of schedule, and is developing a more efficient operation with time. I continue to think that TWOU is a name you have to own.I look forward to providing continuing coverage in the future. Good luck to all."

They use TWOU's platform to offer full graduate degree programs online. The students in these programs receive the same degree or credit as their on-campus counterparts, and generally pay equivalent tuition.Eight of TWOU's nine clients with whom TWOU has contracted to offer 2U-enabled graduate programs were ranked by U.S. News and World Report among the top 75 undergraduate institutions in its 2014 National University Rankings.Currently, eight well-recognized nonprofit colleges and universities offer graduate degrees through TWOU's platform, including the University of Southern California, Georgetown University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of California, Berkeley, and TWOU has contracted with a ninth university to enable a new graduate degree program that TWOU expects to launch in 2015.Any individual student may be enrolled in more than one course during a period.Rising Global Demand for Post-secondary EducationHigher education is a large and well-established market, both in the United States and worldwide.In the United States alone, total revenue for all degree-granting post-secondary institutions was over $550 billion for the 2010-2011 academic year, according to a May 2013 report by the U.S. National Center for Education Statistics.The decade between 2000 and 2010 saw a 37% increase in enrollment in post-secondary degree granting institutions in the United States, from 15.3 million to 21.0 million, according to the U.S. Department of Education, and that number is expected to rise to 23.8 million by 2021, a further increase of 13%.TWOU helps generate revenueFrom TWOU's inception through December 31, 2013, a total of 8,540 unique individuals have enrolled as students in clients' programs, and 82% of students who have ever entered these programs either have graduated or remain enrolled.By the time the last of these individuals graduate or leave clients' programs, TWOU estimates that they will have generated more than $475 million in total program tuition and fees for TWOU clients.HistoryThe first of TWOU's clients' programs was launched in 2009.One additional program launched in 2010, with two more commencing in 2011. In 2013, TWOU's clients launched five new programs.Platform servicesTWOU's innovative online learning platform and bundled technology-enabled services provide the comprehensive operating infrastructure colleges and universities need to attract, enroll, educate, support and graduate their students.By leveraging its solutions, TWOU believes its clients are able to expand their addressable markets, while providing educational engagement, experiences and outcomes to their online students that match or exceed those of their on-campus offerings.TWOU provides a suite of technology-enabled services designed to promote adoption and usage of its SaaS solutions by clients, and enrollment and retention of their students.These services include program marketing, student acquisition, content development for courses and faculty and student support services, including technical training and support, non-academic student advising, academic progress monitoring and career services. TWOU also facilitates in-program field placements, student immersions and other student enrichment experiences.Growth planTWOU is currently engaged by eight colleges and universities to enable 10 graduate programs that have launched and in which students have enrolled.An additional program launched in January 2014, and four additional programs with existing clients are scheduled to commence later in 2014 or in 2015.TWOU recently contracted with a ninth university to enable a new graduate program that TWOU also expects to launch in 2015.TWOU's client contracts generally have initial terms between 10 and 15 years in length, and since TWOU's inception, all of the clients that have engaged TWOU remain active.Dividend PolicyNo dividends are planned.Intellectual PropertyTWOU has one patent application pending in the United States, which is directed to computer-implemented processes that facilitate asynchronous student responses to teacher questions, which is a process TWOU uses in its Bi-Directional Learning Tool, a technology it initially created to facilitate the Socratic method of teaching law.CompetitionSeveral competitors provide solutions that compete with some of the capabilities of TWOU's platform.

2305665,62963,2014-07-10T08:47:35-04:00,TWOU has poor earnings quality.Payback period of 4-5 years is above their peer group.Cashflows are very seasonal.Poor Fundamentals and September Lock up expiration make TWOU a high conviction short.,"2U Inc.: Fails on all Fundamental measuresNew IPO 2U Inc. (NASDAQ:TWOU) hit the market in March 2014 and has been riding the wave of Cloud Computing Fever. The share price has risen steadily and currently trades at $14.77, near its post-ipo high. This article looks at the investment thesis and why this is a screaming short.Head in the clouds?The market has been saturated with cloud computing companies, with numerous IPO's hitting the market in the last 12 months. Not all cloud computing companies are created equally, and key to making smart investment decisions in this market is to understand if the company is a good company and if the price is a good price.Is this a good company?In attempting to answer this question I will look at numerous Fundamental and financial factors to come up with my conclusion.Revenue Quality:The revenue model of TWOU is somewhat challenged. Most cloud computing companies have an element of recurring revenue in their business model. A good example is Fleetmatics (NYSE:FLTX) whose revenues are 100% recurring.Revenues for TWOU are contingent on attracting new student's year in, year out to their programs. This model is largely activity driven and not recurring in nature, and raises a huge question around visibility and sustainability of earnings. This lack of visibility of revenue should warrant a share price discount to peer group.Costs are blowing out:For the most recent quarter total costs have grown at a faster rate than sales, in particular technology and content development costs have risen 75% compared to 37% growth in revenue.This illustrates the TWOU business requires significant investment in content, sales/support and servicing.Furthermore from page 18 of the S1.'Because our client agreements provide that we receive a fixed percentage of the tuition that the clients receive from the students enrolled in their programs, we only begin to recover these costs once students are enrolled and begin paying tuition. The time that it takes for us to recover our investment in a new program depends on a variety of factors, primarily the level of our student acquisition costs and the rate of growth in student enrollment in the program. We estimate that, on average, it takes approximately four to five years after engagement with a client to fully recover our investment in that client's new program.'The very high payback period of 4-5 years poses significant risks. Costs take a long time to be recouped, especially if enrolments don't meet expectations. Most Cloud Computing companies have three-year contracts with shorter payback periods.Concentration:From page 91 of the S1'Our two longest running programs, launched in 2009 and 2010, are with the University of Southern California, or USC. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, 94%, 78% and 69%, respectively, of our revenue was derived from these two programs. We expect USC will continue to account for a large portion of our revenue until our other client programs become more mature and achieve significantly higher enrollment levels.'While the trend is moving in the right direction, TWOU needs to diversify its business and bring in other clients. Too much reliance is placed on USC and poses a risk to the business. A 'customer concentration' share price discount should apply relative to the peer group, for this increase in business risk.Competition:The online learning market is very competitive with primary competitors EmbanetCompass and Deltak, which were acquired in 2012 by Pearson and John Wiley & Sons, respectively, both of which are large education and publishing companies. In addition, colleges and universities may choose to continue using or develop their own online learning solutions in-house, rather than pay for our solutions.TWOU will need to differentiate themselves in this competitive market to remain relevant going forward. The fact that some colleges and universities build their in-house system reduces the overall contestable market for TWOU.Regulatory concerns / Can't Scale:Regulatory concerns raise questions on TWOU ability to scale and overcome regulatory uncertainty. From page 28 of the S1 .'Our clients are required to obtain the appropriate approvals from the DOE and applicable state and accrediting regulatory agencies for new programs or locations, which may be conditioned, delayed or denied in a manner that could impair our strategic plans and future growth.Education regulatory agencies are generally experiencing significant increases in the volume of requests for approvals as a result of new distance learning programs and adjustments to the significant volume of new regulations over the last several years. Regulatory capacity constraints have resulted in delays to various approvals our client institutions are requesting, and such delays could in turn delay the timing of our ability to generate revenue from our clients' programs.'SeasonalityTWOU has a very seasonal cash collection cycle and whilst revenue is allocated over the semester, cash flow on the other hand falls early in the semester which results in cashflow seasonality. Q1 is the best quarter for Cashflow and progressively deteriorates over the next three quarters. I urge investors to review cashflow over an annual period and not to extrapolate TWOU Q1 cashflow over the full year.Atrocious FinancialsCash flow from operations, Years ended December 31, (in thousands), Salesforce.com year end is Jan 2014The table above shows Cashflow from operations for various cloud computing firms. Fleetmatics and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) have a track record of generating and growing cash from operations, whereas TWOU is burning through cash.Q1 of 2013 and 2014 resulted in positive cashflow from operations, only to deteriorate over the full year. I suggest investors factor this seasonality, as described earlier.TWOU has poor earnings quality, high content costs and an inability to scale should warrant a considerable discount to peers.Growth ProfileTWOU is currently growing sales at a steady clip, growing 48% annually for the year to December 2013. TWOU's price to revenue multiple is 7.5 times which is roughly in between CRM and FLTX. However, growth has slowed in the most recent March quarter to 38% and is worth keeping an eye on. TWOU appears significantly overvalued relative to peers and based on fundamental factors described earlier should trade at a significant discount to peers.Upcoming CatalystThree upcoming catalysts will make this short play out;1) Lock up expiration on September 24 2014 is a near-term catalyst and will lead to selling pressure on the stock.2) Q1 is seasonally the best quarter for cashflow and cashflow will deteriorate over the next three quarters for reasons outlined earlier.3) Growth has slowed from 48% to 38% and is expected to slow further as TWOU struggles to scale and diversify outside of key client USC.Portfolio Implementation and SummaryTWOU fails on many metrics and has poor fundamentals. This is based on cashflows, seasonality, earnings quality, competitive dynamics and growth potential. TWOU is burning cash and has never generated cash from operations. Yet, TWOU has a hefty a Price to Sales Multiple of 7.5 which inappropriately prices TWOU in line with high quality cloud businesses.The business is very niche, unable to scale and faces regulatory challenges. A high payback period of 4-5 years, and increases in content costs will lead to increased costs and will limit the path to profitability.Slowing sales growth and the inevitable offloading of shares following the September 24 lock up expiration will see the stock below $5 in next 18 months. This makes TWOU a high conviction short.A high-risk strategy would be to short TWOU North of $14 and cover below $5. A lower-risk strategy would be to short TWOU and pair by going long a cloud company with better fundamentals such as FLTX. Personally, I am short TWOU and long FLTX with a market neutral pair.Disclosure: The author is short TWOU. The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.

2116753,48411,2014-03-31T21:38:36-04:00,TWOU plans to capitalize on the move to all things online.TWOU's market cap and IPO price should allow for a steadier move to higher prices.TWOU's global growth strategy presents multiple catalysts on all time frames.,"Who is 2U, Inc.?2U, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWOU) provides cloud-based software-as-a-service (NASDAQ:SAAS) solutions for nonprofit colleges and universities to deliver education to qualified students. The company's cloud-based SaaS platform solutions include online campus, an online learning platform that enables its clients to offer educational content together with instructor-led classes in a live, intimate, and engaging setting through proprietary Web-based and mobile applications; and content management system, which enables its clients to author, review, and deploy asynchronous content into their online programs.What do they do and what is the opportunity?I'm not sure if industry drives technology or technology drives industry. In either case, we appear to be at the front end of the transition to a new normal based on recent technological advances, specifically the mobile and online revolutions. In the same way that the industrial revolution reshaped the world and the way that everyday activities took place, the ""online"" and mobile revolutions are changing the status quo of societal norms. In this article, we're talking about the societal acceptance of getting an education online. When we talk about online education, even more specifically higher education, we're not talking about anything new. The technology and the opportunity have been around. Huge for-profit education players have taken advantage of a need in what was once a small niche marketplace. As the stigma of ""attending"" an online university has faded, the profits of the business' engaged in offering the services have skyrocketed. So we know there is a need, we know the type of returns that are available for satisfying the need, and we know that until recently the market was isolated to the for-profit education arena.TWOU has been developing and expanding its relationships with non-profit, traditional colleges and universities since 2008 and implemented its first client program in 2009. They plan to capitalize on the transition to all things online and plan to capture as large a percentage of the higher education market as possible. In the US alone, total revenue for all degree-granting postsecondary institutions was over $550 billion for the 2010-11 academic year, according to a May 2013 report by the US National Center for Education Statistics. The decade between 2000 and 2010 saw a 37% increase in enrollment in postsecondary degree granting institutions in the US, according to the Department of Education, and that number is expected to increase another 13% over the next 7 years. The total market is huge, and while it goes without saying that the entire market won't be going 100% online anytime soon even a small percentage of acceptance (this currently exists and is growing) would be a huge opportunity to a market leader.So why hasn't the change happened before or accelerated faster into the technological boom we're seeing? Several reasons, none of which are hard to overcome for TWOU. From the TWOU S-1, ""In the past many non-profit institutions lacked confidence that online programs could offer sufficient quality to align with their brands, market reputations and academic standards. Institutions have been hesitant to adopt new initiatives given that they lacked the capital, technological expertise and marketing capabilities necessary to build online operations"". Recently, the NPI's (non profit institutions) have become more open to the idea of TWOU's platform as an answer to the fundamental challenges staring them in the face. These challenges are primarily that the internet is now allowing new forms of instructional content and courses to proliferate (taking market share from NPI's), most NPI's don't have the staff or technological capabilities to implement an online strategy (alone), and many NPI's are facing increasing financial challenges that prevent them from making large investments into developing technology based solutions (forcing them to either raise tuition or try to squeeze enrollment numbers). The NPI's no longer have the luxury of being the only game in town. It's either find a solution or become less relevant. When you're an NPI and often times the largest employer in your immediate area, neither of those is acceptable.TWOU provides a unique partnership, a joint venture really, for NPI's and with that joint venture they provide an all inclusive solution. TWOU works with the institutional client and helps plan, develop, and implement an online strategy from start to finish, tailoring the experience and the finished product for each clients specific needs. TWOU's value proposition to clients has several pieces: the client doesn't have to change academic or admission standards, clients can increase enrollments that would normally be limited by physical limitations of infrastructure (physical boundaries and capacity constraint), TWOU's platform creates a highly interactive learning experience (more so than typical classroom settings), TWOU provides ongoing analytics that allow the clients to track the engagement and learning outcomes of students to a significantly greater degree than for their on-campus students, the online platform provided allows speed to market and speed to scalability (NPI can implement and scale an online degree program faster than they could on their own), and most importantly TWOU provides a route to a strategy that requires an exponentially lower amount of CAPEX to reach scalability.If that wasn't convincing enough to a NPI for contracting services, TWOU doesn't stop there. TWOU also helps with identifying prospective students and structures their compensation and contracts to consists primarily of a specified share of the tuition and fees paid to the NPI by students in the programs they enable, which aligns their interests with those of their clients. In regard to identifying prospective students, TWOU uses a data driven approach to the expansion of their online platform usage to decide which additional educational academic disciplines to initiate platform usage in. Being tethered to the acceptance and engagement of the actual usage, the success and failure, both parties have a shared interest in not wasting time or capital. They have found a way to become and maintain being a partner with their clients, which has had a very positive effect on the contractual length and retention of the NPI's as clients. TWOU's initial terms of their contracts, given the long term nature of the relationship, generally range between 10 and 15 years in length, allowing TWOU to benefit from the growing enrollments in those programs leading to both revenue growth and expanding operating margins. Every single client TWOU has acquired since inception remains a client. Which brings us to the most important part of this article.Where's the trade?I think before talking about the stock and where the trade may be, I should clarify the existing business TWOU has on the books and go over some of the financials. To be clear, TWOU has only been in existence since 2008 and has been serving clients since 2009. They have a total of 8 clients that offer 10 graduate programs. That's not a typo, they have 8 clients. Five of their programs were launched in 2013 and one program launched in 2014. So before 2013 they were operating a total of 4 programs total, all important to understand from a company maturity standpoint. TWOU is essentially a development stage company that has the revenues and compound revenue growth of an expansion stage company. They truly are an opportunity to get in on the ground level, which would normally mean getting your hands dirty (read: volatile trading and wild fluctuations in quarterly numbers) but based on the company contract structures and revenue models I've done, I don't think the waters will get too choppy for these guys - more on this later.TWOU's two longest running programs, launched in 2009 and 2010, are with the University of Southern California. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012, and 2013, 94%, 78%, and 69% of TWOU's revenue was derived from these two programs alone, which up to this point has provided two massive benefits to the company, steady revenue growth from the existing programs and a floor to base future projections. The opposite could also very easily become true, lowered revenues and marked increases in quarterly volatility, should TWOU lose penetration or growth at the programs at USC, so this is a risk and this risk should not be under stated. That being said, think about TWOU at this point as a 1099 employee of USC, where their analytical data shows that they'll continue to increase enrollment and program expansion, that also has the ability to 1099 at other institutions. Even with zero growth and all other existing contracts falling off the books TWOU would still maintain 69% of it's existing revenue, at this point, not factoring in the already paid for growth that those two massive programs will continue to generate. I look at that as a positive for a company in this stage of maturation. The contracts at USC, in my opinion, help compartmentalize risk and uncertainty.It's also worth noting that CAPEX for all the existing contracts in force have already been priced into the stock, the increased enrollments and revenues have not. That's really important to understand. With the money for a fully scaled program at each NPI spent, lowered CAPEX per customer (assuming steady historical rates of growth) will start to show as slowing net losses and accelerating revenues. Exactly how quick the revenues accelerate is obviously still questionable but the lowered CAPEX per increased dollar of revenue is a major reason to get bullish. In the most simple way of stating it, TWOU's business model is different from other industry models in that it's never taking on more risk, their programs are never more expensive, than at the beginning. The first day they actually open a new program for enrollment is the highest cost per enrollment that program will ever see, which is also risk. Unlike a widget maker, where the company would be able to increase production of widgets based on demand, TWOU has to go all-in on CAPEX on the front end, which clearly is risk. What I'm saying is that they have already paid for the base of the pyramid and as long as they don't outpace the base from a new program growth standpoint (they can't in the next 12 months based on cash on hand and existing lines of credit available), the cost per customer will fall and so will losses. It's just a fact. A fact that will be shown in their next quarterly announcement of numbers.Take a look at how quickly the revenues are accelerating while the net loss and adjusted EBITDA losses remain flat, and remember this was while implementing new programs and with the higher CAPEX:As it stands TWOU has enough cash to last an expressed 12-15 months. They also recently obtained a new line of credit with Comerica Bank in the amount of $37 million. Based on management's growth strategy, they plan on harvesting their existing programs in place and opening one new program in early 2015 that will cover several disciplines at a large NPI that they have not named. What they want to do is show that they can continue to significantly increase revenues and decrease cost per customer, as stated above, before either expanding the share float or raising debt for expansion of the outstanding programs. The stock itself also has a 180 lockup that prevents insiders from selling shares. I think all of the above will lead to a huge uptick in share price (the stock opened to a better than expected +7.5% after pricing to the high end of the IPO range). I like the overall strategy of harvesting before looking to raise debt and expand because what it should do is make the financing easier to get and less dilutive, regardless of the method used. It also shows a well thought out plan from management because in these types of markets company's like TWOU can easily start to be valued at anywhere between 30-60x sales.I really like TWOU stock over the next 12 months and even longer than that if the company is still showing the levels of growth within existing programs that they are showing now. I think they have a solid management team, they're a unique development stage company that has the infrastructure and business model of a company much more mature than they actually are, and I think the conservative 12 months approach they have expressed should serve them well before they really try a run for the roses in 2015. I know this type of business has a low barrier to entry and there are a few other well established competitors but I like TWOU's platform the best and I like that they are working with blue chip NPI's that can help them when it comes to networking into other opportunities (University of Southern California, Georgetown University, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, University of California at Berkeley, mystery 9th university in 2015). Keep in mind when talking about the low barrier to entry that these programs take time to implement (regulatory hurdles, approvals needs, etc) and there is a significant ramp up period into the launch, so the competitors taking notice of the success at TWOU are realistically 24 months behind a serious level of competition, something that doesn't worry me much. I also like that TWOU's platform leverages existing societal trends, specifically social networking, to further engagement and acceptance. It creates several channels of internal communication via proprietary software and applications. I like that they have the competitive advantage of being first, to a large degree, and being successful in the early stages. That they haven't caused any discomfort for their customers since inception. I like that they offer what should be a relatively safe first 12 months of ownership for the equity buyer when compared to other technology IPO's and I like that the buyer will have a chance to reevaluate their long when the company looks to expand in the future and before any drastic changes to the quarterly numbers. I am bullish TWOU and excited for their future. Good luck to all.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in TWOU over the next 72 hours.

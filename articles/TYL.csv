As such, investors are paying a rather steep price for shares here.","This article was highlighted for PRO subscribers, Seeking Alpha’s service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Tyler Technologies (TYL) is an intriguing under-the-radar niche software play. One Twitter user recently wondered why more investors don't own the name:While J didn't ask for my take specifically, as someone who recently owned the stock and now has no position, I'm happy to tackle the question.It'd be easy to look at Tyler stock, see the 75x trailing P/E ratio, and conclude investors are nuts. In fact, that was essentially one of the responses to the above question verbatim.And while I agree with the general idea that Tyler stock is overpriced, don't rush to that judgment just from the P/E ratio. Tyler has followed the classic Amazon (AMZN) and Salesforce (CRM) model. That is to say, instead of maximizing profits today, channel the cash flow back into marketing, investments, and acquisitions that will give off more growth in the future.Investors that simply focus on the P/E ratio miss the underlying mechanism. As you get more recurring subscriber revenues, the value of the business shoots up dramatically. That's because, at any time, the company could choose to turn off its aggressive marketing and growth spend and instead start pulling more cash flow out of the business for share buybacks, dividends, or whatever else suits its fancy. With companies like Amazon and Salesforce, this has largely remained theoretical so far - instead of focusing on accounting profits, they continue reinvesting heavily in new lines of business.With the coronavirus, however, we got an inadvertent look into what a post-growth phase Tyler Technologies might look like. How's that? Simply put, with everything shut down, Tyler couldn't run their usual sales channels. The company cancelled its Connect user conference, for example, which cost it at least $6 million in potential revenues.More broadly, Tyler simply couldn't spend on marketing, travel, and other such costs like it usually would. This resulting in a stunning 226% surge in free cash flow. From the Q2 press release:These are tremendous numbers. During a recession, Tyler's gross margin shot up 290 basis points and free cash flow more than tripled. Right there, you see the magic of a subscription business. Unless your clients go bankrupt, the money keeps coming in. That's still true even when you turn off your customer acquisition costs.Why didn't more customers leave Tyler? That comes back to what makes the business so special. They sell software to local governments - think applications such as courthouse record-keeping and jury management solutions. Local governments are not known for being cutting-edge tech customers. They are slow to adopt, but once you get them, they tend to stick around for decades. Tyler has chosen an excellent niche to focus on, because their subscription revenue is indeed likely to run for an extended period of time. That's in sharp contrast to many SaaS stocks, which obtain similarly high valuations but likely will have far shorter average client retention rates. Technology moves faster in, say, cloud security software as opposed to local government products.As I mentioned, I was long Tyler stock. I purchased at $235 in 2019, and sold at $320 in April. At the time of my buy, I thought the stock was aggressively priced, but reached a little given the impeccable quality of the business. Thus, imagine my surprise when shares traded more than 30% higher in a year, even with the business' momentum dramatically slowing down over that stretch. Given the variety of other stocks on sale in April, it was hard to justify holding onto Tyler.And since then, some bad news has arrived. For Q2, for example, overall organic revenues declined 2%. Hardly terrible given a pandemic. But when you're paying more than 12x sales for a company, down 2% isn't an ideal revenue growth level. And total bookings dropped 32% on the quarter versus the same period of 2019, showing the acute impact the pandemic had on the sales channel.Bulls on the stock can point to the fantastic cash flow numbers I pointed out above. And they'd be right on that. Earnings also came in way ahead of expectations thanks to the surge in profit margins.But here's the thing. When you pay 12x sales for a company, you need tremendous forward growth for the investment to make sense. So it's not right to applaud the company for one quarter of unusually strong profitability and cash flow generation. If Tyler tunes down the marketing budget here and aims on generating profits and cash flow, the stock price is likely much too high.For one thing, even with the huge earnings boost this quarter driven by falling overhead, EPS still came in at just $1.30 a share. That was after a 68% jump, so that's excellent. Still, that annualizes to just $5.20 per share, meaning the stock is selling for 65x those earnings even assuming lower costs going forward. Whereas, we should probably expect them to turn the growth machine back on as soon as virus conditions allow.But let's ignore earnings. Cash flow from operations also soared this quarter, hitting $40 million. Annualized, that'd make for $160 million of cash flow. Admittedly, the June quarter is traditionally slow for Tyler so the full-year number should be higher. Regardless, we're talking a free cash flow yield somewhere in the low-to-mid 1% range, as Tyler's market cap is around $14 billion. I'd also like to point out that Tyler's shares outstanding have grown by nearly 25% since 2012. Given the current market cap, we're talking about several billion dollars of dilution away from shareholders since the start of the period. The math behind buying a stock that pays out as much or more in stock comp as it generates in free cash flow isn't necessarily great.Since software stocks took off in 2013, Tyler Technologies has generally traded in a fairly stable range of 8-12x revenues. It's been remarkably consistent, in fact, with 8x sales serving as support on numerous occasions:Data by YChartsOnly with the rush into tech stocks following the virus outbreak has Tyler finally broken out above 12x sales. Here's the problem for long-term investors though. In the past, you could pay a high price for Tyler stock with the confidence that the stock would soon grow into the valuation - revenues have compounded at 14%/year over the past decade. So even if you paid, say, 11x sales in 2016, you'd be back to 8x sales thanks to growth within a year or two.Now, however, revenue growth stopped altogether in Q2. Presumably it will pick back up later this year or certainly in 2021. However, it will probably take a hit given the soft bookings number. Recurring revenues from maintenance and subscription contracts is up to 75% of the overall pie now, as well, so the tailwind of shifting consumers from one-time to recurring revenue is largely played out.This is one of the more challenging macroeconomic backdrops Tyler has faced in awhile. Yet the price/sales ratio is obliviously bouncing along near its highest point ever. By contrast, I expect the P/S ratio to drop significantly in a correction as investors factor in the big growth slowdown.A return to 10x sales - a median price for Tyler in recent years - would take the stock to $278. A drop back to 8x sales, its often-seen support level, would amount to a share price of $220. If you assume revenue growth returns, forward targets could be a little higher. If the company can get back to 10% revenue growth, 10x forward sales would be around $300, and 8x forward would be in the low $240s. These price targets don't imply a total disaster for Tyler investors by any means. However, it's not appealing to pay $341 per share for the business today.I suspect investors are too excited about the surge in cash flow and earnings without considering how much the loss of revenue growth hurts the long-term story here. In other words, don't count on Tyler's improved profitability metrics to last. As margins slide back to normal, investors may question the company's unusually high price/sales ratio."

Stock is breaking out to all-time highs, and aggressive investors should buy now.Tyler will flourish in the pandemic-driven economy with its remote government services.","Tyler Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:TYL) is a company that until recently has not captured my attention. Tyler provides software services to local and state governments, and this quite frankly doesn't excite me in normal times.(Source: Tyler Technologies)In general, revenue growth of 16% CAGR is less than I typically look for, and much of the growth comes from acquisitions, 31 acquisitions since 2006. I am usually crooning over hot high-growth stocks in excess of 30% CAGR revenue growth.But times are not normal, and I have a new appreciation for companies with customers that don't default on their payments. Customers such as various governments.(Source: Tyler Technologies)Tyler claims to be the number 1 provider of software solutions to local/state governments, with consistent revenue and EPS growth since 2002.(Source: Tyler Technologies)While Tyler did not see an overly significant impact in Q1 due to the pandemic, the management has taken a cautious approach and withdrawn guidance for the remainder of the year. It did indicate that it expects single-digit growth for this year due to 70% recurring revenue, and of the remaining 30%, ""a lot comes out of the backlog and is pretty essential and has to occur.""Tyler has some pretty interesting services for the stay-at-home environment, including:I like the fact that Tyler has consistent growth over the years, as well as a strong free cash flow margin of 23%, and cash and equivalents in excess of $300 million, enough to keep this company out of trouble, even if we experience a prolonged recession.(Source: Portfolio123)But most of all, I like that Tyler's stock is breaking out to an all-time high.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)The market is calling this one, and you should never disagree with the market. Therefore, I am giving Tyler a bullish rating. This company will be around and in good shape once the pandemic scare subsides and global growth restarts.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The rule provides a single metric for evaluating both high-growth companies that aren't profitable and mature companies that have lower growth but are profitable. Revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) must add up to at least 40% in order to fulfill the rule. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can tolerate some level of negative free cash flow. But if a company grows by less than 40%, then it should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less-than-ideal growth. This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate-growth companies. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so ones.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to a previous article I have written.The two factors required for calculating the Rule of 40 are revenue growth and free cash flow margin. Tyler's annual revenue growth for the last year is 16%. The company's TTM free cash flow margin is a strong 23%.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)Therefore, the Rule of 40 calculation for Tyler is as follows:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 16% + 23% = 39%Tyler's score, although just slightly shy of 40%, is close enough, in my opinion, especially given the company's posture in the current economic climate.There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher-growth stocks are valued more than lower-growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward sales, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how Tyler stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward sales multiple.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the valuation. In this instance, Tyler is positioned well above the best-fit line, suggesting that the company is overvalued on a relative basis relative to its peers.Conservative investors could wait for a pullback and/or scale into a position. But I would not plan on a pullback. More aggressive investors should not wait to invest in this stock. It is making its move now.There are several risks that investors should consider before investing in Tyler. First of all, I view the current stock market action to be reminiscent of the Dot.com era, immediately prior to the crash starting in 2000. Back then, I quadrupled my investments in a few months. Technology stocks were hopping. But it didn't take long before the market turned into a disaster.While Tyler is not as overvalued as some of its peers are, such as Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM), Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM), and Coupa (NASDAQ:COUP), it is still overvalued and Tyler would likely get swept away along with its extremely overvalued peers.Tyler has recently broken out to an all-time high. When a breakout occurs, it usually signifies more bullishness to come. Tyler is a strong company with annual revenue growth of 16% and a positive free cash flow margin of 23%. Although it shyly missed on the Rule of 40, the miss wasn't significant enough to dismiss the thought of investing in this company.So far, Tyler has not experienced a significant drop in business due to the pandemic. But the company management has withdrawn guidance for the remainder of the year due to the uncertainty of the virus and economy.The stock movement is strong and so are the company's fundamentals. While the company's market valuation is somewhat high, I believe that an investment is still warranted given its likelihood of success through this period of uncertainty and the bullish breakout.Conservative investors may want to wait for a pullback or scale into a position. Aggressive investors should take note of the breakout and consider getting in now."
4172194,101421,2018-05-10T11:05:08-04:00,"Tyler Technologies has announced the acquisition of Sage Data Security for an undisclosed amount.Sage has created a consulting and managed services company that assists clients in cybersecurity threat detection.With the deal, TYL is expanding its offerings to local governments in need of proactive data security technologies and service options.","Tyler Technologies (TYL) announced that it has acquired Sage Data Security for an undisclosed sum.Sage has created a managed security and consulting services company to help enterprises better defend against cybersecurity threats.TYL hopes to expand its software and service offerings to local governments buy acquiring Sage's consulting and managed service system, especially its nDiscovery threat detection capabilities.Portland, Maine-based Sage was founded in 2002 to provide consulting for cybersecurity engagements with SME businesses.Management is headed by founder and CEO Sari Greene, who has held numerous positions in the security industry and is the author of a security practices book and online video course.Below is an overview video of Sage's nDiscovery Threat Detection service:(Source: Sage Data Security)Sage's primary offerings include:The firm has 240 clients in a variety of sectors such as healthcare, retail, financial, government, and education.There have been no disclosed funding rounds, so it is likely the firm is bootstrapped or financed by local investors.According to a 2017 market research report by MarketsAndMarkets, the global cybersecurity market is expected to reach $231.94 billion by 2022.This represents a CAGR of 11.0% from 2017's baseline of $137.85 billion.While the managed security and consulting services segment of the market is much smaller, given the increased focus by businesses on securing their increasing IT investments, I expect the growth rate for managed services to match that of the overall CAGR within the industry.The main drivers for this expected growth are the increased adoption by enterprises of cloud computing as they transition from on-premises environments as well as the constantly evolving threats from hackers and even state-level actors.Major competitive vendors that provide managed security services and consulting include:There are numerous other large, medium, and small cybersecurity consulting and services vendors across a range of functionalities and geographies.Tyler didn't disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn't file an 8-K or disclose a change in financial guidance, so the deal was likely for a non-material amount for Tyler's current $7.8 billion market capitalization.Consulting services are frequently acquired for low single-digit multiples of their revenues. Given Sage's size of 45 employees, its annual revenues were likely under $10 million and the multiple was likely between 1 and 1.5, so I expect the deal was for less than $15 million in total consideration.Tyler is focused on providing software solutions to the public sector and is acquiring Sage to expand its consultative cybersecurity offerings to government agencies.Sage provides an outside team to assist organizations in detecting threats and all of its operations and employees are expected to become part of a new 'independent department for client data security'. The group will continue to operate as an entity within Tyler.As Tyler's president Lynn Moore stated in the deal announcement:TYL's stock has risen slightly in the eight days after the announcement as the chart below indicates:(Source: Seeking Alpha)More important is TYL's stock performance in the last 12 months, with the stock rising from $170 to $227, a 33.5% gain.This performance has been more than double the S&P 500 index during the same period and provides TYL with the resources to acquire the capabilities it needs as management seeks to improve its offerings to government organizations in the U.S.The firm's prospects are buoyed by improving local government finances in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008/2009. While it's taken years to dig out of that financial hole, local governments are spending more than previously, especially in the area of cybersecurity.The deal for Sage is a strategic move that makes sense and should result in quick integration in the coming quarters. I'm bullish for TYL as it continues its focus on government software and security."
4228129,104958,2018-12-13T11:44:23-05:00,Tyler Technologies has been consistently growing its earnings at 30% per year over the last five years.Earnings and revenue growth are expected to continue in 2019.The majority of analysts favorably recommend buying the stock.Tyler Technologies stock price could easily surpass its record high of $249.,"Tyler Technologies (TYL) is a true growth stock providing investors with a solid long-term investment opportunity. The company has a strong history of earnings growth and more growth is forecast.The stock price has fallen around 25 percent over the last two months from its record high as the market indices pull back from their record highs. The stock is still expensive but most good growth stocks are expensive.In my opinion Tyler Technologies is worth buying as a long-term investment for its future growth and capital gains potential.The current price decline also provides short-term investors with a trading opportunity that's backed with solid fundamentals. For a short-term investment I would personally wait for the stock price to rebound above $190 before taking a long position.Tyler Technologies has been expanding with solid growth (calculated from ADVFN data).From 2013 to 2017 the company's revenue has grown 15 percent per year and earnings have grown 30 percent per year. The book value has increased 32 percent per year during the same period.Another metric that I personally use for an expanding company is to check for an increase in the number of people it employs. Tyler Technologies has increased its employees by 10% percent per year from 2013 until 2017. This confirms that the company is expanding.Tyler Technologies operates with a reasonable ROE (return on equity) which for the last five years is mostly above 10 percent.The company has not paid a dividend since 1990.Tyler Technologies has reported financial results for the third quarter of 2018 (based on third quarter 2018 data from Seeking Alpha and Yahoo).The company reported earnings of $0.96 per diluted share which is in line with analyst estimates. The reported revenue is $236.1 million which missed analyst estimates by a few percent but was still up 10 percent from $214.7 million from third quarter 2017.The return on equity is reasonable at 14 percent and the operating margin (profit to sales ratio) is good at 17 percent.The current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) is 1.5 which indicates that Tyler Technologies is a little light on with its working capital (ideally the current ratio is greater than 2.0 but many companies operate with lower levels of working capital).The debt ratio (long-term debt to tangible assets) is zero as Tyler Technologies does not carry any long-term debt on its balance sheet.The total ratio (total liabilities to total assets) is 24 percent which means that Tyler Technologies' total debt is only 24 percent of the value of everything the company owns (note that the asset value is the book value and not the liquidated value of its assets).The company's book value is currently around $36 and with a stock price of $184 Tyler Technologies is trading well above its book value.Analysts forecast that Tyler Technologies revenue and earnings will continue to increase through 2018 and 2019 (data from Seeking Alpha).The analysts' consensus revenue forecasts are $941 million for 2018 and $1.04 billion for 2019 (up 12 percent and 10 percent, respectively).The analysts' consensus earnings forecasts are $4.80 per share for 2018 and $5.38 per share for 2019 (up 15 percent and 12 percent, respectively).The 2018 PE ratio is 38x and the 2019 PE ratio is 34x (based on analysts' consensus forecast earnings with a current stock price of $184).Tyler Technologies has 11 analysts’ who have provided recommendations (data from Seeking Alpha).These recommendations are: Six strong buys, one buy and four holds. None of the analysts provided an underperform or a sell recommendation.The six analysts with the strong buy recommendation certainly think that Tyler Technologies' solid historical growth will continue. It's also comforting for investors looking to buy the stock that there were no analysts that felt that the stock should be sold or avoided.Let’s look at what Tyler Technologies is worth. An accepted valuation method for growth stocks is the PEG (PE divided by the earnings growth rate).The earnings growth using reported data from 2013 to 2017 was 30 percent per year. But the annual earnings growth using analyst forecast data has dropped to 15 percent for 2018 and 12 percent for 2019.Using the lower 2019 annual earnings growth of 12 percent will lead to a more conservative valuation, and this lower growth rate is more likely to be sustained into the future. This gives a forward PEG of 2.8 with a 2019 PE of 34x.A forward PEG of 2.8 does mean that Tyler Technologies is overvalued with a current stock price of $184. The fair value with a forward PEG of 1.0 gives a fair value stock price of around $65.While a forward PEG of 2.8 is high, most growth stocks do have high forward PEG ratios.The analysts have provided a consensus stock price target of $230 (data from Seeking Alpha). This target is higher than the current stock price of $184 but is below the high of $249 reached two months ago.Active investors may prefer to conduct their own analysis based on the stock’s recent price history. This is the approach that I personally prefer.Tyler Technologies chart by StockCharts.comFrom the stock chart I concluded that the stock price could easily surpass its high of $249 if Tyler Technologies continues with its impressive uptrend. The stock price has pulled back 25 percent from its high of $249 to $184 in the last two months. This pullback started when the broader market indices pulled back from their highs. This pullback is most likely just part of the broader market pullback rather than anything specific with the company.While Tyler Technologies is a solid growth play with a chance to buy on a pullback, there are risks that investors should be aware off.Even after the pullback Tyler Technologies is still trading above its fair valuation based on its forecast earnings potential.The stock is expensive and the stock price could fall further due to future earnings growth not materialising. The forecast earnings growth is less than its five-year historical growth rate and if future earnings fall short of forecasts this will make the already high PEG valuation even higher.Another risk is with the broader market. The market indices have been trending upwards with a bull market that began in 2009. These market indices have currently pulled back from their highs and there's always the risk that this market pullback could be the start of a bear market.Also, the stock's pullback may not yet have bottomed and the stock price could fall some more. As a short-term investment I would personally wait for the stock price to rebound above $190 and also wait for the market indices to rebound. Taking a long position in a falling market will likely see the stock price fall some more along with the market.When there's uncertainty short-term investors may feel more comfortable when the risks are managed. The more technically inclined investors could manage their risks by placing a stop-loss below the low of the pullback.For a long-term investment the stock is expensive even after its pullback but the stock has the potential for significant capital gains. Long-term investors would need to be prepared as the stock price could fall some more before bottoming out. Over the long term I would expect the stock price to fully recover and continue higher in line with Tyler Technologies' future growth potential.Tyler Technologies is a growing company. The growth fundamentals are strong and the company has a solid history of growth. The analysts are expecting this growth to continue though 2019.The stock price has pulled back from its record high of $249 to $184 as part of the broader market pullback. While the stock is still overvalued based on its earnings potential most good growth stocks do sell at high valuations.In my opinion Tyler Technologies is worth buying as a long-term investment for its capital gains potential.As a short-term investment I would take a long position if the stock price rebounds above $190. The upside potential is considerably more than the record high of $249 from two months back."
3565866,56112,2015-10-13T11:00:47-04:00,"Local governments are in desperate need of new software, and Tyler Technologies has just the solution.Strong revenue growth, expanding margins, and high visibility/stability all make Tyler a great business story.Unfortunately, a nosebleed valuation seems to more than price in the company's investment merits.","Not your daddy's local governmentQuick, play word association with ""local government."" I'm conjuring up mental images of scuffed tiles, sleepy bureaucrats, and jury duty. It's not exactly where you'd expect a hot growth story, and perhaps that's why Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) is running away with the space.Local government entities spend $12 billion per year on vertical specific software, of which ~$5B could theoretically be addressed by Tyler's broad line of software. Tyler's product line ranges from basic financial systems and ERPs to more specialized student information and transportation management systems for schools and integrated justice systems that cover juries to jails. Tyler offers both SaaS and on-premise options but, unsurprisingly, is focused on shifting clients onto the SaaS model.Tyler estimates that there are over 500,000 local government software systems being used in the United States (since each local government uses multiple systems). Of these, roughly, a third are from a vendor like Tyler, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), or SAP (NYSE:SAP) while the other two thirds are from vendors that are no longer competitive or are homegrown systems often custom developed in COBOL in the 70s and run on mainframes. Tyler typically doesn't have to do much convincing; the local government buys a new system because they need one.The trend of transitioning seems to be accelerating as the workforce ages: even if young techno 20-somethings knew how to maintain the system, they would feel out of place without their cold-brew coffee and open office plans, and are nearly impossible to recruit. I'm being facetious, but only a little - Tyler believes this one-two punch is resulting in increasing pressure for municipalities to update and outsource their IT and utilize a SaaS model going forward.All that to say, it's a surprisingly good space to be in. As this slide from their investor presentation demonstrates, Tyler has historically grown revenues at a 15% CAGR despite a brief slowdown post-2009 due to budgetary pressures.Growth will remain strong going forward; the market is growing at 5-6% and Tyler is stealing share on top of that, anticipating long-term growth 2x the market. In particular, the company is seeing very good growth from e-filing, which not only accounted for 3 to 4 points of revenue growth in 2014 but also has gross margins in the 70% range (vs. overall gross margins currently in the high 40s).Cash Flow, Growth, And Stability? Say It Ain't SoSometimes it seems like you can have either cash flow or growth in tech-land, but don't you dare ask for both at the same time. Tyler breaks that trend, generating solid (mid-20%s) non-GAAP operating margins and strong cash flow conversion despite the rapid growth. With 61% of the revenue mix recurring, you even get a lot of stability and visibility (98 to 99% of maintenance agreements are renewed). As a business, there's a lot to like here.If that weren't already good enough, Tyler is looking to expand operating margins to the 30%s and gross margins to 60% over time. The former will partially come from operational leverage on SG&A costs, while both will be driven by the changing revenue mix towards SaaS.This transition will take time; Tyler management continually stresses that it is ""gradual."" There are still a lot of customers who are used to the traditional on-premise approach (cue the jokes about government lifers) - so it is important for the company to maintain the on-premise offering to avoid disqualifying itself from that segment of the market. 26% of new deals in 2014 were SaaS,For Better Or Worse, M&A Is Part Of The StoryAt the Needham conference in January 2015, CFO Brian Miller made it clear that this M&A will be part of the playbook going forward:I'm on the fence. M&A well done can create tremendous value, but all too often, the buyer just ends up overpaying. My broad view is that M&A competence is like American drivers or the children of Lake Wobegon - everyone thinks they're above-average, but mostly they're really not.In the case of Tyler, historically, they have focused on tuck-in acquisitions (like SoftCode, acquired in 2014 with only $3 million in revenue) that are designed to fill in gaps in the product portfolio and provide clients with a one-stop-shop. Judging by the company's financial performance, these seem to have worked out well.But now they've seemingly changed approaches. In a deal worth $670MM ($360MM in cash and $310MM in TYL shares) - by far the largest acquisition in TYL history - the company recently agreed to purchase New World Systems. In hindsight, CEO John Marr telegraphed this on the Q2 conference call:New World's suite of public safety applications (two thirds of revenue) seems to fit well with Tyler's end-to-end justice offerings, and the growth rate (low double digits) puts it in the same range as Tyler. The rest of the portfolio is complementary as well, and at 37% EBITDA margins, they're not exactly buying empty-calorie revenue.Tyler and I may have different definitions of ""discipline"" on value, though - at an even 5x revenue and 13.7x EBITDA, the deal isn't unreasonable versus peers but also didn't come superbly cheap. In the public conference call discussing the deal, management noted that their guidance ""reflects more additional costs than cost synergies"" and that they have ""no plans to materially impact the New World workforce or their operations at their headquarters in Troy."" As we'll discuss in a moment, given where Tyler's shares are trading, the transaction will likely be very accretive - but given the strong growth in Tyler's existing business, I'm still not sure I see a tremendous financial rationale for making a deal at a time when valuations are generally elevated. New World seems like a set of nice to have but not have to have assets.A Valuation Floating In The CloudsIt's always fun when you have to rub your eyes and make sure you didn't accidentally transpose ""EV/revenue"" and ""EV/EBITDA"" in your spreadsheet. That is the situation I found myself in with Tyler; even by software company standards, it's expensive no matter how you slice it. On this one, I don't think I even have to make excuses for being a value investor... TYL EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YChartsNote that YCharts' numbers are trailing and don't adjust for the acquisition, but still, they paint the picture. I would be very interested to hear someone justify TYL's valuation on the basis of the fundamentals. Forward numbers pro forma for the acquisition are better, but are still far from inspiring.For context, as I mentioned in my recent writeup of Q2 Holdings, data from Scale Venture Partners suggests SaaS companies growing at 30%/yr have averaged a valuation of ~5x revenue or so over the past decade. Tyler - which as discussed, isn't even fully SaaS - is not organically growing the top line at 30%/yr, and is trading well in excess of that revenue multiple. In their defense, they are very profitable, which many SaaS companies are not (since they plow all of their cash flow into hiring more salespeople to continue to grow). Back to Tyler, though - even if you assumed they could magically hit their long-term margin target overnight, the stock still wouldn't be cheap.Despite my usual lack of proclivity to do work on the short side, Tyler's valuation is so incredibly high that I found myself considering it for a brief moment. I came to my senses, however. As many value investors have found out, shorting good businesses, even at nosebleed valuations, can be a long and painful road that rarely leads where you think it does. I don't see any immediate catalysts that would trigger a rerating, and in fact, M&A potential on both the buy and sell side presents a risk to potential shorts. Notwithstanding the lofty valuation, TYL could be an acquisition target - as has been proven time and time again, deep-pocketed big tech companies are often willing to buy their way into growth or a specific area at any price. Last year, for example, SAP bought out expense management vendor Concur for $8.3 billion, representing nearly 12x run-rate revenue.On the other side, as an acquirer, TYL can continue to use their richly valued shares to accretively buy revenue and cash flow, as they did recently. For so long as there is an arbitrage between their multiple and the multiple of the companies they're buying out, they can cash in their pricey shares for real cash flow.ConclusionFor the moment, like so many others, Tyler ends up in my somewhat frustrating ""monitor"" bucket - it's a business I would certainly be willing to own, but not at anything close to the current valuation multiple. That, of course, is outside the company's control - and at least from an outsider's perspective, they seem to be executing well on their opportunity set. So for growth-oriented investors, it's likely a business worth doing due diligence on in hopes of picking up shares once the business grows into the valuation, or vice versa."

The stock's big pullback post-earnings demonstrates the dangers of buying (or continuing to hold) shares in a company at a valuation that makes no rational sense.Make no mistake: Tyler is a great company, with a unique position in the state and local government software market. Its recent results and 2016 guidance, in the grand scheme of a low-growth, economically uncertain world, should properly be seen as blowing the roof off. Unfortunately, even with shares down pretty significantly, I have a hard time making a fundamental case for the stock, despite my appreciation for their business model.Legacy Tyler Growing Fine; New World Orders The IssueGiven the major New World Systems acquisition, Tyler's reported numbers will look a bit messy for a while, but management is doing a good job of bridging the gap for investors. On an organic basis, Tyler's organic growth was 15.3% in the fourth quarter and 16.7% for the full year 2015. Excluding New World, organic growth in 2016 would be around 12%, which is at the low end of the company's long term 12-14% growth target. I don't view the slight drop as a particularly big concern; the factors underpinning the long-term growth story haven't changed any.The other issue that may be getting lost in the weeds is the relative stability of the growth story here compared to, say, a Manhattan Associates (NASDAQ:MANH). Tyler did very well through the recession, and while state and local governments will certainly feel a pinch during downturns - Alaska, for example, is having a rough go of it right now thanks to oil prices - on the whole, Tyler's customer base is much less reactionary than corporate buyers.The bigger issue on the revenue side is the weak performance of NWS out of the gate: the company now expects 2016 revenue contribution of $124 million (vs. $134 million expected at the time of the acquisition.) This is driven primarily by prospective NWS clients taking a time-out and evaluating their options in light of the acquisition (with a smaller, $3-$4 million portion due to differences in accounting/revenue recognition timing). Tyler management, for their part, is confident that this is just a timing issue rather than a loss of business.I have mixed feelings on this front. Digging in a little bit here, NWS basically has two lines of business: 70% is in the public safety space, mostly complementary to Tyler's offerings there, while 30% is in the ERP space. The former category probably isn't an issue; the value proposition may actually be stronger now that the combined entities have a broader suite of products to bring to market.In the latter category, however, NWS was one of Tyler's primary competitors, with a strong solution. Many prospective clients likely investigated Tyler's offerings, whether as part of a formal RFP or not - and it seems reasonable to believe that some subset of these potential revenue dollars actively chose to not go with Tyler, and may not be willing to do so now.In other words, it would be a bit like if you signed up for T-Mobile's (NASDAQ:TMUS) cell phone service because you didn't want to go with one of the big bad carriers - if one of those carriers bought T-Mobile out, there would naturally be a certain amount of revenue attrition as customers who didn't want to go with a big carrier in the first place leave for greener pastures.In other words, I don't think you can just take Tyler's ERP win rate and NWS's and add the two together; there will likely be some dis-synergies (potentially partially offset by better results on the public safety side).In the case of Tyler, I'm honestly not sure why you wouldn't want to go with them, other than perhaps in certain areas where you really needed a best-of-breed point solution - but there will always be competitive wins and losses. I'm willing to eat my words six months or a year down the line if NWS's growth reaccelerates, but I think there may be a certain portion of customers on the ERP side who choose to go elsewhere.Ultimately, I think it bears repeating that this isn't a huge deal from a business perspective - we're talking about a couple of points of revenue growth for merely a part of the business. The problem, of course, is valuation; any sign of continued weakness and there could be much further to fall for the stock.Margin Expansion Potentially DelayedI'm less concerned about a point or two of revenue growth in the midterm and more concerned about the margin expansion story (or potential lack thereof). While this may be a counterintuitive premise in software land, where - as I've pointed out in many other pieces - most investors focus on revenue growth, I think things are a little different with Tyler. Indeed, the stock trades at over 6x forward revenues, versus substantially lower valuations for SaaS companies growing much faster, and Tyler management has made it quite clear that expecting more than a low-mid teens growth rate over any period of time is probably unrealistic.The obvious difference is profitability: not only does Tyler generate cash flow today, but it promises to generate a lot more tomorrow. As I discussed in the last article, operating margins have steadily marched up over time.That appears to be taking a bit of a pause in 2016, though, and more pressingly, perhaps even beyond that. In the near term, Tyler is choosing to invest more in R&D for ""discretionary competitive investment"" to continue to accomplish certain strategic goals. The specific goals here are broad: refreshing old and tired UIs, more seamlessly integrating point solutions and acquired products, building out mobile functionalities, and continuing to strengthen point solutions (which in some cases are not industry-leading/best-of-breed). Management guided to around $25 million of ""investment"" spend, good for a solid 3 points of operating margin.In the near term, this is not the world's biggest issue - the question, however, is whether they will continue to make such investments with incremental margin dollars. The tone on the call, to me, strongly suggested that they might choose to do so.Given management's long-term track record, I don't think there's much reason to question their decision-making here. If they think increasing R&D is a good thing, then I can run with that, although I do find it a little odd in context of their already industry-leading position in many areas. Nonetheless, from an investment perspective, a slowdown in margin expansion is a problem, since that's what you're paying up for - 12% revenue growth with no operating leverage is hardly enough to justify the valuation here.Valuation Still The ProblemIt pains me to nitpick at the issues I've discussed above, because at the end of the day, Tyler is a very good business that has been managed exceptionally well over the past decade. Unfortunately, with the valuation where it's at, even little issues are big issues.Since the long-term value is so sensitive to assumptions of revenue growth and margin, I think it's actually easier to reverse engineer what the current stock price implies rather than trying to forward-calculate a ""fair value.""Let's start with a very bullish long-term forecast of margins. Tyler's mature units are doing somewhere in the neighborhood of ~35% (non-GAAP) operating margins. New World had high-30s adjusted EBITDA margins, and weren't really investing much in new product development. Per CEO John Marr on the call, this mid-30s level seems like a reasonable long-term aspirational goal:Let's now give Tyler full credit for achieving this - and beyond - and play with 40% operating margins (that's EBIT, not EBITDA). Let's further also give them full credit for all adjustments and not bother backing out stock-based comp, etc. We'll call this ""Fairy Tale EBIT."" At the midpoint of revenue guidance, Tyler would generate around $310 million of ""Fairy Tale EBIT."" The current enterprise value represents more than 15x that number. Put differently, if you translated Fairy Tale EBIT down to Fairy Tale EPS, you'd get something in the neighborhood of $4.90 in EPS, rather than the guidance of $3.33 to $3.45, and the stock would still trade at ~25x forward earnings.Relative to the last time I did an analysis like this, at least the numbers don't look totally absurd - 25x forward earnings for a business growing at 12%/yr is, I suppose, not wholly unreasonable. That said, what's your upside to offset the downside? Because in the real world, we are not at 40% operating margins (not even close, and not even clear if we can ever get there). I don't think you could assume a higher multiple, because there's not going to be a lot of operating leverage left at 40% margins, and there's similarly not likely to be much higher than low-teens long-term revenue growth. Finally, of course, entirely excluding stock-based comp and all the other adjustments is probably aggressive.What's it worth if they don't achieve the operating leverage, or if margins stall out in the low 30s? Well, we're currently trading at 36x forward (non-GAAP) P/E, and over 20x forward (non-GAAP) EBIT. These are high multiples for a company that's expecting 12% long-term revenue growth unless you do get that operating leverage. All in all, I still have a very hard time seeing fundamental upside here outside of the absolutely perfect execution scenario.Finally, as much as I may like Tyler as operators, I do think that they could do better as capital allocators. It's not good sport to criticize management teams for buybacks in hindsight, but I did think they should have used stock for the NWS deal (what's the point of having an exorbitantly-priced currency if you don't use it to lock in value?). I'm also skeptical that buybacks will generate any meaningful value, and there are very real modeling scenarios where they destroy value.Wrapping It UpIt really pains me to have to sound negative here, because I greatly respect what the Tyler team has accomplished, and see a long runway for continued success ahead. Unfortunately, so does the market - and even with the sharp drawdown, the assumptions embedded in the share price are still far too aggressive for my tastes. The stock looks fairly valued only if you assume margins reach what I would consider to be the highest level possible, pronto - and that's not consistent with what we're actually likely to see in the near-to-medium term. There is a lot more downside here if margins don't start expanding again, or if prospective NWS ERP clients choose to take their business elsewhere, and revenue growth is further pressured.Tyler Technologies is a stock I'd really like to own, but it's going to take a much steeper fall for it to come into a range where I'd be comfortable buying.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

4335394,67113,2020-04-01T05:08:27-04:00,The fim reported an impressive set of Q4 numbers with respect to subscription growth.No technical damage has been inflicted as a result of the coronavirus.Shares may drop to $260 before launching higher.,"Tyler Technologies (TYL) operates in the software niche of the technology sector. The company provides management solutions as well as services for the public sector both in the US as well as international markets. The combination of public service customers and the growth of software services piqued our interest in this stock which we will discuss below.The firm announced its fourth quarter earnings (which also gave us 2019 annual numbers) on the 12th of February. The most significant point which was made on the earnings call was that the firm had finally broken the $1 billion mark in annual revenues in fiscal 2019. Adjusted EBITDA also rose to its highest level of over $300 million in the same year. Earnings in the fourth quarter came in at $1.43 which means they came to $5.30 for the fiscal year. Q4 revenues came to $288.84 million which was a slight miss which consequently brought full year sales to $1.09 billion.With respect to guidance for fiscal 2020, management is projecting non-GAAP revenues of approximately $1.215 billion and non-GAAP earnings of $5.66. The top line sales growth rate looks particularly attractive here. If guidance is met, that top line guidance number would return an 11%+ growth rate.There is a lot to like about Tyler at present although we project some weakness in the near term. Let's discuss this.Firstly, what was quite apparent in Q4 was the significant jump in the SaaS business. This is what shareholders want. Recurring revenue. In fact, when one delves more into the numbers, sales growth would have actually been higher in 2019 if the sales mix had not been skewed more towards sales of subscription products. Non-GAAP subscription sales grew by well over 30% in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter of 12 months prior.This growth in the more lucrative part of the business has resulted in Tyler now generating a whopping 67% of its sales from recurring avenues. Recurring revenues were less than 50% just a decade ago. Therefore, we would expect margins to ramp up from here. Subscription revenue feeds on itself the way compound interest does. In fact, we would expect this number to be over 70% very shortly.Although, intangibles and goodwill make up approximately half of Tyler's assets, the firm's present book multiple of 7.3 is still behind the 10-year average of 9.9. Top line sales accelerated last year by 16% and grew again in the fourth quarter by over 19%. From a sales perspective, the firm does not look cheap but the firm's assets have not seen a big increase in price which will probably be only temporary in my opinion. Remember assets are what essentially create sales and earnings. They are the roots that bear the tree. There is a clear divergence between Tyler's assets at present compared to its sales. We do not believe this divergence will last though.On the long-term chart, we can see that shares have not undergone any technical damage which is encouraging. In fact, we see no apparent divergences on the RSI oscillator which would suggest that more aggressive selling is in front of us. Our near-term target would be for shares to come down to that multi-year trend line before we get a bounce here.If we go to a more short-term chart, we can see that shares are most likely undergoing a topping formation at present (double top). This would lead us to believe that the March lows will be at least tested again. Remember, the price dropped to $250 a share on the 18th of this month. This is 17% below where shares are trading at present. Suffice it to say, if we were to get an opportunity around this price level, we may just initiate a small long position.To sum up, Tyler shares look like they want to go higher but we see some short-term selling first before shares find a hard bottom. Let's see if we get a retest of those mid-March lows over the next few sessions."

(TYL) is a leader in enterprise software & solutions for the public sector market and offers a powerful business model, with a significant growth opportunity of a further market penetration and transitioning into a pure SaaS business model. A public sector software market is very healthy with a steady 7-8% growth and there is a strong opportunity on the market, for upgrading existing outdated IT systems and applications. The company has a strong competitive advantage, by offering a broad suite of products that work well together across several departments and help the public sector to make better strategic decisions and improve operational efficiency. It consistently generates revenue CAGR of 13% with 98% retention rate, EPS and free cash flow CAGR of over 20%, combined with very strong margin expansion over the last several years. I expect the company to scale its business by offering cloud-related services that will drive further shareholder value-creation by achieving a double-digit revenue growth rate, combined with gradual margin expansion and an increased share repurchases over the next couple of years.Tyler Technologies, Inc. was founded in 1966 and it operated as a diversified industrial conglomerate until 1997. Mr. H. Lynn Moree has been its CEO since May 2018 and has joined Tyler in 1998. The company is offering a broad line of software solutions and services that help local governments and school districts to become more efficient, improve operations, and deliver more value to the public. It provides solutions for the core functions of government, like civic services, Appraisal & Tax, ERP and Courts & Public safety, Data & Insights, and K-12 education.Public spending environment is very healthy at the moment with consistent high single digit growth rate over the last several years and also local governments are becoming more tech savvy and want to offer better services to its citizens. Usually, state and local governments don't have huge internal IT staff, therefore, they prefer products & solutions that are easy to use with strong customer service. There is also a shift of the public sector workforce, as new people come from private companies that have new ideas and are more open for changes in technology, like using cloud solutions or online court dispute offering. I believe this shift in mentality is also the key growth driver for Tyler's solutions and transition to a SaaS business model.Source: UBS Technology Presentation, November 2018Subscription revenue consists of SaaS arrangements that come from cloud-related offerings and from E-filing services for courts and law offices. Customers can choose between traditional on-prem licenses agreements or subscription-based type of products and 30-50% of new customers choose SaaS type. According to Gartner, the enterprise SaaS market is growing by 32% per year and the company reported this quarter exactly 32% SaaS growth Y/Y. The company also expects a growing number of new and existing customers to choose a subscription-based model over traditional software licenses agreements in the future. The key reasons for the shift are a digital transformation of the public sector and customers willingness to use cloud-based services.On April 30, 2018, the company acquired Socrata, Inc., a company that provides open data and data-as-a-service solutions for state and local government agencies for about $150 million. I find this acquisition very important for future subscription business growth as it is a pure SaaS solution, and the company has now better technical capabilities to do business with federal government and agencies. Socrata has contributed a lot to a stronger pipeline and integration with other Tyler's divisions.A newly established Socrata Data-as-a-Service Platform helps clients to take data from several source systems to the cloud, organize and customize it according to their needs, and then making data usable for strategic decision making. It also offers transparency by making data available to the public, so they can see how local states are spending their money or what crimes are being reported in their neighborhood. Customers can also save 40% to 60% of development costs by using cloud data APIs and they can choose from various templates, what makes their workflow easier. The company also offers several other cloud-related solutions like performance optimization cloud that test and monitor the effectiveness of programs, financial insights cloud that can illustrate trends and improve financial oversight and also operational intelligence cloud that helps with an analysis of KPIs and supports project teams with decision-making.Source: UBS Tech Presentation, November 2018The company also reported a steady public sector software market growth of 7-8%, but management is optimistic it can grow 1.5-2x faster than the market and has reported revenue CAGR of 17% from 2010 to 2017. It is also important to notice that share of recurring revenues has shifted from ~55% to ~66%, between 2010 - 2018 and I think this share will gradually increase towards 80-90% as the company transitions towards more SaaS mix. That will lead to a revenue growth towards ~20% together with operational leverage, as SG&A expenses grow slower compared to total revenues. According to the latest data in YCharts figure below, SG&A expense increased ~10% quarterly Y/Y compared to total revenues growth of ~18% quarterly Y/Y. It will also drive further margin expansion that is averaging more than 100bps annually.TYL SG&A Expense (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsTyler operates in a highly competitive market, against smaller private companies, central internal IT departments of local governments and also against certain divisions of large companies like SAP AG, Thomson Reuters Corp., and Oracle. The key competitive advantages are single-focus on the public sector and Tyler's ability to offer an integrated system of applications for several offices or departments that drive a high retention rate of ~98%. However additional competition or shift of existing clients to provide IT services internally could cause a market share loss, intensified pricing pressure, and reduced margins.Source: UBS Technology Presentation, November 2018The company has an Addressable market today of $7B in Public software and a Total Addressable Market of $16billion, with over 450,000 total potential systems. It is around 13% penetrated in the current addressable market and I expect they can easily increase market penetration with a large opportunity to upgrade government software over the next several years. Well, the governments are not profit oriented and use IT systems or applications as long as they can. Competitive vendors like Tyler or SAP AG provided ⅓ of the potential systems, while ⅔ of the potential systems were homegrown or provided by non-competitive vendors that are no longer on the market. That creates a significant growth opportunity for the company to expand market share by organic growth or with strategic acquisitions.Source: Earnings Release, November 2018The company reported, total GAAP revenues of $236.1 million in Q3 18, compared to $214.7 million in Q3 17, missing the analyst estimates of $242.3 million. Subscription revenue was $58.7 million for the Q3 18 or up 32% Y/Y and the reason for an increase was primarily due to new SaaS clients as well as existing clients who converted to the SaaS model. Gross margin and operating margin decreased 110bps to ~47% and 470bps to ~16%, respectively. Recent acquisitions related costs and an increase in staff-related costs drove margins contraction. The company reported Q3 18 non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS of $49.7 million and $1.23, respectively, in-line with analysts' consensus EPS estimate and up 18.9% compared to Q3 17 numbers. Cash and cash equivalents increased to $219.4 million in Q3 18 and that gives the company flexibility to return capital to shareholders with share repurchases or make strategic acquisitions. The CEO Lynn Moore Jr. stated the following :Source: Earnings Release, November 2018The market is steady and there is a higher demand activity with strong win rates on the enterprise side. Justice products grow slower than expected, however, they are set for a better double-digit long-term growth and the total value of new public safety contracts signed is up 34% YTD. The sales cycle is also steady for core products, however, for new products it takes a longer time for the market to recognize their true value proposition and generate revenues. Therefore it might take slightly longer time for newly established cloud-based pure SaaS solutions to achieve its full potential and generate peak revenues. The company signed 29 new contracts with an average software license of $465,000, compared to 32 new contracts with an average license value of $381,000 in Q3 17. However, the contract duration of new software subscriptions declined to 3.6 years this quarter from 5.4 years in Q3 17. Because the company has a high SaaS retention rate, it is comfortable with initial three-year contracts, as they provide greater pricing flexibility to respond to potential changes in costs or customers' operations.Overall, Socrata revenues are increasing and the company reported revenues for Socrata of $8.4 million YTD, what is lower than revenues of ~$25 million Socrata had on a stand-alone basis in FY 2017. I believe now after Tyler's acquisition it can achieve higher annual revenues of $25 million. Socrata Connected Government Cloud that enables internal data sharing signed seven new contracts in the quarter, while Tyler's 250 sales representatives are already pitching it to the entire 15,000 customer base. Socrata has significant cross-selling opportunities what will also lead to a better brand awareness. There is also a lot of market excitement around Socrata Public safety analytics and its integration with other public safety products, and management expects the deal size to grow in Q4 18. I am also confident that aggregated public data available on Tyler's cloud services create a valuable information that might have strong commercialization opportunity.Source: Derived from Reuters & Finance YahooThe company also provided its full-year non-GAAP 2018 Revenue and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance of $940 million - $950 million and $4.76 - $4.84, respectively. The analyst consensus estimate for FY 18 is non-GAAP revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $944.2 million and $4.80, respectively. Shares are now trading at a premium to peers at forward P/E and EV/REV multiple of ~35.4 and 7.95x, respectively.TYL EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsI firmly believe that Tyler's transitioning into a SaaS model can drive shares growth even further to peak EV/REV historical multiple of ~10x. Well, it is lower than ~14x for its competitor Workday, but on the other hand, it is still double the average EV/REV multiple of ~5x for SaaS companies. Nevertheless, given the recent growth software selloff, I think now is a good opportunity to buy quality growth small and mid-cap software names.Tyler Technologies is still an interesting buy even though the stock has outperformed S&P 500 over the last 5 years. As the company is trading at a premium EV/REV multiple compared to peers, any business growth slowdown or lower than expected guidance over the next several quarters might be a trigger for a significant decrease in the stock price and consolidation towards major peers multiple of ~5x. The key bullish catalysts are the gradual transition towards a pure SaaS business model with cloud-related services. Another important catalyst is a further market penetration of outdated systems in the public sector together with strong up-sell and cross-sells opportunities of newly established Socrata cloud-based products & solutions to existing customers. Key risks to my thesis are intensified competition in the public sector software market, global macro headwinds or a significant slowdown in SaaS revenue growth rate."

TYL's software applications and services are generally grouped in three areas: financial management and education; courts and justice; and property appraisal and tax.The bull pitch is that TYL is focused on smaller governmental agencies that may not be ""attractive"" enough for the larger competitors within the space (Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP (NYSE:SAP), Infor, others), equating to a ""focus"" strategy (the lesser known of Michael Porter's competitive strategies). Furthermore, it's not too far a leap to assume TYL's revenue stream is rather sticky (public sector spending on software that would cause a huge headache to change). When you combine a textbook competitive strategy, with some proven growth, and ""sticky revenue""… you get a small cap hedge fund darling. But when the strategy requires a shift towards larger counties and you add a revenue ""miss"" after an acquisition, the most notable 13F filers (largest % of portfolio) start liquidating (""Smart money is selling"").I was pitched this stock as a long, but thought ""it's too crowded and it smells like a roll-up waiting to crack"". Certainly, roll-ups can be wildly lucrative, but returns can be heavily dependent upon timing the exit, and being late to the party can be disastrous (if you bought within the last year, you're late!). Although often touted as ""compounders"" very few roll-ups offer sustainable intrinsic value growth. Most run out of steam when acquisition opportunities dry up, pricing can no longer be pushed (power within the value chain!), and/or costs can no longer be cut (operational leverage!). Shareholders are far too often remembered as bag-holders who were caught holding a no-growth conglomerate when they were promised an ""amazing platform"" that would garner a premium. Shorting roll-ups can be scary, but given current sentiment and the Street's expectations, TYL makes for a great shorting opportunity with at least 50% downside.Recent news convinced me to perform diligence on the company, but before diving into my ""finds"" and conclusions, I'll offer a quick summary of recent news.Recent News and Troubling ResponseEarly indications of a problem with TYL's Odyssey software showed up back in 2014, when Indiana inmates were mistakenly released because of alleged errors in the information system (Odyssey), and other inmates filed a lawsuit claiming they were held too long after their release was ordered.More recently, numerous news sources have reported significant problems that allegedly stem from local government agencies' use of TYL's software. On November 4th, 2016, East Bay Times reported on the ""disaster"" ""new case management system"" that may be at fault for unlawful arrests and imprisonments in Alameda County. Less than two weeks later, a class action lawsuit was filed against the Sheriff of Shelby County, which can be found here. Given that an individual's complaint would be against a local government agency, it comes as no surprise that local government agencies are being sued, as opposed to Tyler Technologies (this is important!).The most recent article can be found here (Dec. 2nd), which may have caused more noise than management was willing to abide, given TYL's statement a few days later (Dec. 7th).Since early November, TYL's stock has traded off by ~7%, which may indicate that the market isn't tremendously concerned. Perhaps Mr. Market is optimistically predicting these instances are a combination of user error and opportunistic lawyers?That being said, I was shocked by TYL's response and the market has had a negative response as well: the stock has traded off by more than 3% in the last couple days. This is the summary of the response:Source: Company FilingsReal Talk Translation:How can this (in Dec. 2016) be management's position given reports like this from March 2015? Given the post-update trade-off, the market may not approve of potential ignorance and/or denial by management.In case you didn't read any of the above links, the words ""nearly identical"" suggest there is in fact a common denominator:Source: ARSRTI believes it's pretty clear that there is a problem, and management is denying responsibility and perhaps not making the required effort to fix the problem. Even if these issues truly have nothing to do with TYL's software shortcomings, its public response may hinder future growth.It's also important to note that Odyssey is a meaningful business line for TYL given it reportedly serves over 100MM residents in more than 900 counties. !!IMPORTANT!! With an average county size of less than 115k people, it's not surprising that these issues haven't reared their ugly heads earlier, as small counties don't stress/test software nearly as much as large counties !!IMPORTANT!! Shelby County has nearly 1MM residents and Alameda County serves over 1.5MM residents. TYL recently won the business of Multnomah County, which serves about 800k residents.After reading TYL's response to recent reporting, I thought, ""this sets up for a great short if there is evidence of other software/legal issues"". Unfortunately for shareholders, TYL was sued back in April, settled a few days before its Q1-2016 filing, and decided not to disclose what I consider to be a very material event. This suggests that there may be systematic software and management issues at TYL.To conclude this lengthy introduction, here is a recent stock chart and insider selling activity:Source: Google and NASDAQNew World Systems (NWS): Steep valuation, past allegations, and a recently settled lawsuit (post acquisition and undisclosed within Qs):Before we go any further, it's important to note that these allegations are not coming from ""ambulance chasers"". They are coming from frustrated and fed-up governmental agencies which presumably know that their complaint will be forced to arbitration given the language within the software agreement. It's also important to recognize that NWS is TYL's largest acquisition to date, and came at a time when organic growth started to collapse (graphic shown later).Before we discuss what TYL received when it purchased NWS, let's first consider what it paid.According to the recent filings, the ""purchase price allocation for NWS is not yet complete"":Source: Company FilingsI could speculate here, but I'll leave that to the readers. For valuation purposes, I'm using the Nov. 2016 investor deck, where we can see that TYL acquired NWS for an EV/Sales multiple of 5.64x:Source: Company FilingsAt >5.6x revenue and >$120MM in place, you'd expect GROWING REVENUES and certainly NO LEGAL TROUBLE! Unfortunately for shareholders, it seems that either TYL has downgraded its revenue expectations over time, or there has been a decline in revenue. This is from October 2015:Source: Company FilingsAlthough a 7.5% decline ($124 from $134) may not seem meaningful, this is supposed to be a ""fast growing SaaS"" company so anything but an upgrade is at least concerning.Legal liabilities related to New World Systems offer insight into plummeting organic growth (what TYL received).Back in April 2016 (less than five months after the NWS acquisition), the City of Great Falls sued New World Systems (Tyler Technologies as of Nov. 2015) on seven counts:1. Breach of Contract2. Unjust Enrichment/Rescission and Restitution3. Breach of Express Warranty4. Breach of Implied Warranty5. Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing6. Negligent Misrepresentation7. NegligenceSource: PACERI encourage readers to download and read the case file, but essentially, the City of Great Falls alleges that there was a software upgrade that never worked. NWS said it was because the city needed new hardware, but it didn't work after the hardware upgrades either. The allegations read as though the city (looking back on its history with NWS) felt swindled. After years of alleged struggles and disagreement between the parties, the case was settled at break-neck speed shortly before the Q1-2016 quarterly filing and prior to a ""response"".Source: PACERSource: PACERTYL Management offered this ""business as usual"" disclosure within the subsequent three quarterly filings (Q1-Q3 2016):Source: Company FilingsRegardless of the details of the settlement, I find it concerning that a lawsuit relating to the core business of the largest acquisition to date, and significant revenue generator, is considered ""routine"". As an investor, I would certainly consider NWS allegations to be material as potential customer losses speak to future revenue and cash flow generation as well as management's ability to make sound capital allocation decisions, which is vital to a roll-up/platform play.Perhaps these allegations are in fact ""routine/incidental"" given that TYL's management likely reviewed the following case prior to acquiring NWS:Source: PACERIn the case of City of Huntsville Texas vs. New World Systems Corporation, NWS is accused of Fraud and Negligent Misrepresentation.Certainly, this is an old case that was forced into arbitration per the software agreement. Please give me a moment to describe why it matters:1. Given that the case was forced into arbitration (setting a precedent) AND a recent case with similar allegations was filed shortly after TYL's acquisition, it is reasonable to infer that there may be other instances that went straight to arbitration and/or instances that are currently being arbitrated without public filings and/or disclosure.2. Although I'd expect management to find evidence of the City of Great Falls complaints during its diligence given that the city had been complaining for years (per the allegations), the fact that there was a FILED case (City of Huntsville), TYL's management has no excuse regarding a ""diligence miss"" related to the City of Great Falls or other complaints because the Huntsville case should have served as a red flag for further diligence.In light of these facts and increased potential legal risks (Shelby Sheriff being sued for what many on the ground are saying was a software shortcoming), TYL's management ought to provide investors with details regarding past instances and/or ongoing arbitration related to software complaints.Source: PACERWhy in the world would the hedge fund darling acquire a company with instances of alleged fraud and misrepresentation allegations at such a rich valuation?I try not to speculate within these SA articles, but I don't think the below argument is all that speculative/controversial:1. TYL enjoys a rich valuation and in the face of organic declines likely needed non-organic growth to justify said valuation: Organic growth began plummeting prior to the acquisition and has settled around 11% as of late. With gross margins of <50%, it's tough to justify an EV/TTM Sales multiple of 7.34x (6.15x forward):Source: Company FilingsSource: Software Equity Group2. TYL is very acquisitive: Therefore, it's highly unlikely that it wasn't aware of NWS's legal history and customer complaints (which led to a lawsuit <5 months after acquisition):Source: Company Filings1+2 = 3. If revenue growth above and beyond organic growth was/is needed to justify the stock price (per the comps), and management has a ton of acquisition expertise (wouldn't ""miss"" NWS allegations and past legal dealings), then I can only conclude that management has shifted towards a ""growth at all costs"" strategy.Roll-up failures have a well-documented past, so it shouldn't be controversial to say that a ""growth at all costs"" strategy is unsustainable. Growth at all costs is even more dangerous for unsuspecting investors within a space that is predominately based on revenue and revenue growth (SaaS space broadly).In order to further convince myself of poor management, I considered a labor dispute.Ongoing Labor Dispute Suggesting a Potential Negative Management Grade (in case NWS wasn't enough)I typically don't put much weight on labor disputes, but they can be telling/important as third or fourth order effects. An ongoing labor dispute can be found on the PACER system that alleges the following:1. Discrimination in Violation of Title VII - Sex and Wage2. Retaliation in Violation of Title VII3. Violation of the Equal Pay Act4. Retaliation in Violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act5. Discrimination in Violation of the ADEA6. Discrimination on the Basis of Sex and Wage in Violation of the NYHRL7. Retaliation in Violation of the NYHRL8. Violation of NY Labor Law § 1949. Retaliation in Violation of NY Labor Law § 21510. Age Discrimination in Violation of the NYHRLSource: PACERThe plaintiff worked as an account executive from approximately June 5, 2013, through her termination effective February 16, 2015. The lawsuit was filed on June 4, 2015 and is ongoing. The complaint reads how you'd expect a labor dispute, and TYL denies most allegations. TYL does however admit that the plaintiff met the job requirements, was the only female account executive in the company's Versatrans division during the plaintiff's employment, that the plaintiff's sales representative counterparts had a higher base salary, and that she spoke to HR about being underpaid compared to her male counterparts.The labor dispute case is ongoing per the PACER system as of 12/12/2016.Prior to valuing this business, I'd like to summarize where we're at thus far:ValuationA true bear could easily make the argument that this stock is simply un-investable given the potential legal risk going forward.At a very minimum, it's abundantly clear that forward prospects are deserving of a downgrade:1. Forward prospects are reliant upon landing larger counties and/or acquiring additional revenueBUT2. Several indications suggest that TYL's software struggling to handle the needs of larger counties, and its most recent acquisition seems to have been a huge misstep (downgraded revenue and immediate legal troubles).As mentioned, the SaaS space is predominately priced based on revenue, forward growth, and EBITDA margins. Previous graphic for ease/reference:Source: Software Equity GroupGiven organic growth (reported) of 10-12%, EBITDA margins of 20-25%, and net margins of 9-12% (declining as of late with TTM of 9.26%), 2-6x TTM sales is a reasonable ""80% confidence interval"".Note: I'm not going to get into a FWD earnings argument here because roll-ups are often cheap on a non-GAAP forward earnings basis. It's part of the joke! For reference, TYL's non-GAAP earnings exceeded GAAP earnings by ~44% in 2015, ~26% in 2014, and ~34% in 2013. Unfortunately for the folks who believe the numbers provided by Wall Street (driven by management in this case), GAAP earnings are by far the most empirically correlated metric with stock returns (Barth, Cram, and Nelson). My ""Fair Value"" case is in the ballpark of a 30x FWD GAAP earnings, 40x+ TTM earnings.With implied FWD growth of ~19% and organic growth of 10-12% (declining), speculators are likely wondering, ""when will the next acquisition announcement be made!?""Assuming that TYL makes an acquisition by the end of THIS MONTH, it would need to buy a business with revenues of $50-60MM (at likely cost of $230-350MM based on historic EV/Sales acquisition prices) in order to meet revenue expectations for 2017.With every day that passes, those numbers increase (can only book revenue upon completing an acquisition). Time is on the side of short seller, and this dynamic increases the odds of value deteriorating acquisitions.Are there enough targets? Will the quality of the targets decline? Will NWS drag organic growth lower? These are all questions a great speculator can surely answer! Perhaps more interesting, if TYL can find additional targets... will there be a greater fool who pushes the stock higher?In very practical terms, it's going to be tough to hit 2017 sales expectations without making acquisitions. Whether or not the market ""likes"" those acquisition(s) is another probability node. If TYL misses another four quarters (from now, excluding downgrades), would you be surprised if this ""fast growing SaaS"" company was cut in half?Price Target: $72.5 assuming additional lawsuits aren't brought by local government agencies.One should also note that TYL has missed on revenue the last two quarters:Source: Seeking AlphaTick. Tock. Tick. Tock. Perhaps the Bulls (and Mgmt.?) will get to feel the pressure of ""time"" as so many short sellers and option traders know all too well.SummaryHappy Holidays!!Note: TYL acquired ExecuTime in June 2016, but this acquisition won't meaningfully add to revenues given how the announcement was written and the lack of any disclosure or mention of the transaction within the recent quarterly filing:Source: Company FilingsRTI reached out to TYL but did not receive a response."
2502185,20568,2014-09-17T14:21:54-04:00,,"Let’s face it, consumers in America are especially finicky. What’s the hot thing today is old news tomorrow. Tastes and trends change as fast as Chicago weather. That’s why subscription-based business models are appealing to many investors. Subscriptions are what I like to call “sticky money.” If you’ve already signed up for a monthly service, you basically have checked that off your list and you’re on to the next item. And how many people go back and cancel subscriptions in a timely fashion? Some do, but most don’t.That’s subscription service in the world of the individual consumer. Now imagine the slow moving world of municipalities. All their red tape, bureaucracy, and things that frustrate us about the government. But in the case of subscription services, that’s in our favor and makes a subscription service you sell to municipalities just about the “stickiest money” you can imagine.Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) Tyler Tech (NYSE:TYL) is the largest software company in the nation solely focused on providing integrated software and technology services to the public sector. Their mission-critical applications provide counties and municipalities with the ability to streamline and automate operations, resulting in improved productivity and reduced costs. Their professional services for local government clients include consulting, network design and management, installation, conversion, customization, training, and ongoing support.Tyler is successfully building a fast-growing closed-based business inside a proven, profitable software license and maintenance business. Subscription revenues grew 39% in 2013.Analysts have taken notice of Tyler’s growth prospects as well. Recently, earnings estimates have been revised to the upside. The revisions have pushed consensus for the current year up from $1.63 to $1.73 per share. Next year’s numbers have been revised in an even more bullish fashion, rising up from $1.89 to $2.16.Tyler Tech has also built up a bit of a track record of beating estimates recently. Over the course of the previous four quarters, TYL has beat earnings three out of four times. Last quarter earnings came in at 45 cents, 4 cents above consensus estimates of 41 cents.I’ve been watching this stock for a very long time, trading it for the first time in 2012. The end of 2013 was a very bullish time for TYL, running all the way up to an all-time high of $107.99. This year, however, has been a bit rocky. An earnings miss for Q4 2013 led to the stock breaking below the century mark and trading all the way down to $74.37 in April 2014.After the drop, TYL consolidated in a trading range below the $82 level until a breakout in June. From there the stock reached highs just shy of $100. The recent price action above the $87 handle carves out a new range and provides a clear cut level of support. Currently the stock trades just below the 40-day moving average. That average has a slope approaching zero right now, indicating a range bound stock. To profit from a range bound trade you need to buy TYL lost to $88, where it is today, with a stop near $87. This way you limit your downside risk on a stock that could potentially initiate a new trend in either direction. Or, you could wait for a break of $92 to play the breakout on this one.Disclosure: None"
3069426,39591,2015-04-14T12:16:57-04:00,"Tyler Technologies has an edge over competitors such as national enterprise software firms and smaller local & regional players.
        I think that Tyler Technologies’ earnings quality is high, given its healthy free cash flow conversion ratio, impressive organic growth track record and high level of recurring revenues.
        Among Tyler Technologies’ offerings, e-filing for courts has strong growth potential, and the low hanging fruit will be the cross-selling of such services to existing court clients.
        Tyler Technologies seems expensive on conventional valuation metrics, but its historical track record of compounding shareholder wealth and its growth potential should reward patient investors with a long term horizon.","Elevator PitchTyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) has significantly outperformed the market over the past year in terms of share price performance. Its share price is up by 63% for the past 52 weeks, compared with a 13% rise for the S&P 500 over the same period. I am typically cautious of investing in such ""momentum stocks"", but I am reminded of Charlie Munger's quote that ""over the long term, it's hard for a stock to earn a much better return that the business which underlies it earns,"" when I think about Tyler Technologies. Tyler Technologies is a good company boasting competitive advantages and high earnings quality. It has a long growth runway ahead, with only a mere 5% market share of an estimated $13 billion addressable market. In particular, its solutions associated with e-filing for courts has strong growth potential. Investors' investment returns should approximate the Company's business returns (five-year historical average ROIC of 20%) in the long run.Company DescriptionTyler Technologies is the largest U.S. software company focused solely on the public sector. Its financial management and education solutions, such as modular fund accounting systems for government agencies and student management systems for K-12 schools, represent close to two-thirds of its revenue. Tyler Technologies' solutions for the Courts & Justice and Property Appraisal & Tax product segments account for the remaining 20% and 10% of its sales. It currently boasts a client base of more than 11,000 local agencies, school districts, cities & towns and counties.Competitive EdgeTyler Technologies' competitors are national enterprise software firms such as Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), Infor Lawson and Thomson Reuters Corporation (NYSE:TRI), and small local & regional firms.While some of these national enterprise software firms might have more financial resources, Tyler Technologies' exclusive focus on the public sector is a significant competitive advantage that keeps its competitors at bay. Tyler Technologies' decades of experience servicing public sector clients has allowed it to accumulate considerable domain expertise and an in-depth understanding of their specific needs. In addition, most of its employees have worked in either the public sector or at schools previously. As a result, the Company has been able to tailor its products as closely as possible to its clients' circumstances, and integrate its products into their customers' operations. Tyler Technologies' client retention rates are as high as 98%.There are also network effects at play here. Tyler Technologies hosts an online forum called Tyler Community, which allows its clients to ask questions, offer suggestions and share useful insights. The information that Tyler Technologies collects from Tyler Community enables it to improve existing products and develop new solutions targeted at the needs of its public sector clients. As Tyler Technologies adds more public sector clients, its knowledge of their needs grows, which allows it to serve its clients even more effectively. Due to Tyler Technologies' superior service quality and reputation, more public sector clients will eventually decide to engage Tyler Technologies' services. This results in the creation of a virtuous cycle, which benefits Tyler Technologies tremendously.Tyler Technologies' edge over its smaller local & regional competitors is its ability to leverage on scale economies to reinvest in new products to drive future growth. It increased its spending on research & development (R&D) by 84% from $14.0 million in 2010 to $25.7 million in 2014, but managed to maintain R&D expenses as a percentage of sales within a steady 4.8%-5.6% range. In contrast, Tyler Technologies' sub-scale peers will find it difficult to support and sustain increasing R&D spend.The numbers speak for themselves. Tyler Technologies' 2002-2014 software-related revenue (excluding hardware sales and appraisal services) CAGR of 15%, compares favorably with the industry long term growth rate of 4%-5% (derived based on public sector and education spending applications and vertical specific software). This suggests that Tyler Technologies has been taking market share away from competitors.High Quality Of EarningsTyler Technologies generates high quality earnings, in my opinion.Firstly, a significant portion of Tyler Technologies' revenue growth is derived organically. Tyler Technologies' software-related revenues (excluding hardware sales and appraisal services) expanded at a 2002-2014 CAGR of 15% to reach $463 million last year. Excluding acquisitions, its organic software-related revenue 12-year CAGR over the same period was 13%. In addition, although Tyler Technologies has completed 15 acquisitions in the past eight years, the deal sizes have been relatively small (under $25 million per transaction). With most of its revenues generated organically, Tyler Technologies has a lower probability of masking its true profitability through the assignment of arbitrary values to purchased asset and liabilities via acquired goodwill.Secondly, Tyler Technologies has a very healthy free cash flow conversion ratio. Its free cash flow was on average approximately 190% of net income for the past five years. Conversely, companies with free cash flow-to-net income ratios significantly below 1, could potentially derive a big chunk of their earnings from non-operating and non-cash items, implying a lower quality of earnings.Thirdly, Tyler Technologies has a high level of recurring revenues, which is growing rapidly. Recurring revenues account for approximately 61% of its top line, and they have grown at a five-year CAGR of 16% from $142 million in 2009 to $301 million in 2014. Persistence and sustainability are key characteristics of high quality earnings, and Tyler Technologies' growing recurring revenue stream is a strong positive in that respect. That being said, there still remains the risk of a company classifying one-off items such as the sale of a business as recurring revenue streams. Nevertheless, all things equal, income derived from recurring sources is superior to one-off, non recurring gains.E-filing For Courts Offers Growth OpportunitiesTyler Technologies is experiencing positive growth momentum, with its backlog increasing 27% year-on-year to $702 million as at the end of 2014. In particular, Tyler Technologies' court document e-filing business is the most promising in terms of future growth prospects.Courts and legal offices are progressively transitioning from paper filing to electronic filing for the management of their documents. Legislative requirements (increasing number of states in which e-fling is mandatory), cost savings, increased efficiency and enhanced security are among the drivers prompting the shift from paper filing to e-filing. Tyler Technologies is well-positioned to capitalize on this growing trend. Tyler Technologies was appointed by the state of Texas as the statewide provider for mandatory e-filing of civil courts documents. The implementation was a success, with eFileTexas.gov processing approximately 100,000 filings per week by the end of 2014. Tyler Technologies' excellent work with the state of Texas should enable it to win new contracts from other courts considering the implementation of e-filing.In Q4 2014, the Company grew revenues from e-filing for courts by 34% year-on-year to $8.8 million. Looking ahead, the greatest opportunity comes from the cross-selling of Tyler Technologies' e-filing implementation services to existing court clients. For example, 28 courts in California have engaged Tyler Technologies to implement case management solutions for them since 2012. As at end of 2014, Tyler Technologies has already inked e-filing contracts with courts in 17 counties in California. As Tyler Technologies wins more case management solutions contracts from California courts, it should witness a multiplier effect on its revenues resulting from the cross-selling of its e-filing implementation services. In its 2014 Annual Report, Tyler Technologies writes that ""we also expect that most of the 30 counties in California that have not yet committed to replacing their case management systems will eventually do so.""Valuation And Expected Investment ReturnTyler Technologies has been an excellent compounder of shareholder wealth in the past few years. If an investor had invested in Tyler Technologies five years ago, the investor would have earned six times his or her original investment. This is hardly surprising, if you consider the fact that Tyler Technologies grew its revenue and EPS by 2011-2014 CAGRs of 16.8% and 25.3% respectively. However, it seems to be expensive on conventional valuation metrics, trading at 42 times forward P/E and 37 times trailing twelve months EV/EBITDA. However, a single point valuation multiple does not do justice to the future potential of Tyler Technologies.While Tyler Technologies is already a leading company in the domestic public sector software space, it only has a mere 5% market share of an estimated $13 billion market. This implies a long growth runway for Tyler Technologies. Given its past track record of compounding shareholder wealth, Tyler Technologies should reward patient investors with a long term horizon. One of my favorite Charlie Munger quotes is that ""over the long term, it's hard for a stock to earn a much better return that the business which underlies it earns."" Tyler Technologies delivered ROICs in the high teens for the past five years averaging 20%. Going forward, Tyler Technologies should be able to compound its high ROICs over a long growth runway and deliver solid investment returns for investors.Variant ViewTyler Technologies is heavily reliant on local government spending. While a significant portion of local governments are on ageing and outdated IT systems, there is a possibility of current and potential clients deferring such upgrades in times of spending cuts."

That's a good thing because it means you can relate to what I'm thinking as I write about stocks.Following last week's stock analysis of CommVault Systems (NASDAQ:CVLT), I realized that I could provide better information by providing more of an unfiltered narration as I go through stocks. That also means you may read some random thoughts once a while.Since I'm still going through the Forbes Best Small Companies list, I'll continue providing more of an ""over the shoulder"" look at how I'm thinking as I try to go through this list. I'm 25% through the list of 100 stocks and it's only February. So far so good.When starting to look at a brand new company, I like to briefly browse the company website, get a feel for what they do and who their target audience is.By understanding what market the company is targeting, you can make the qualitative analysis process easier. For example, a jeans retailer that targets teens is going to be extremely volatile in terms of business operations and cycles compared to a jeans company that only sells above $300 a pair. You can see the difference in sustainability and competitive advantage simply based on who the target market is.Now, Fortinet operates in a tough space of providing network security solutions focusing on products such as firewalls, spam filters and switches. This is an area I can understand, so I can begin looking at the numbers before I decide whether I really want to dig in.When it comes to fast growing tech companies, I'm always concerned about the potential of losing money simply because of my inability to foresee what's going to happen a couple of years down the road. I also prefer software and services tech companies over hardware based. Once equipment is purchased, it won't be replaced for at least 5 years, whereas in software, a yearly payment is required.If you are user of Old School Value's Premium Fundamental Analyzer, follow me and turn to the ratios section. Here, you will get a good overview of the current status as well as a rough idea of whether a stock is cheap or expensive. The idea at this stage is not to get an accurate intrinsic value figure.That's for later if the stock is worth further consideration.Fortinet Ratios At the moment, the current valuation is high. I don't overly focus on relative valuations, but when I see a P/FCF of 56, EV/EBITDA of 32 with decreasing ROE, ROIC and CROIC, that's enough for me to move on.For fast growing small companies, I understand that FCF isn't the best measuring stick because the company has reinvested into the business. But when I come across a company where I'm uncomfortable performing any type of valuations, it's a better use of my time to pass.You can go a little deeper and check out margins, share dilution, how well management is being paid and the expected growth.If you like the tech sector, you should really be going through the Forbes list yourself. Since it's looking for fast growth companies, a majority is made up of tech with high sales growth, ROE and margins. On the flip side, when the market is raging, there is less opportunity because most of these companies have already raced upwards.Tyler Technologies provides software and services solutions to the public sector. Now this is the type of tech company I like. I wrote about NIC Inc (NASDAQ:EGOV) previously, where NIC Inc creates web based solutions for people to make payments via the internet for government services.Tyler Technologies operates on the other end. They create back end software and solutions to help local governments get things done. My initial impression after reading the description was that growth would be limited. After all, the federal government isn't going to increase spending on IT upgrades by 30% year after year for Tyler Technologies to take advantage of.The above statement was listed on the company's website under ""highlights"". I can't agree that it's a highlight as it shows there is a cap to how big the company can get.Moving on.Time for the ratios again.Tyler Technologies Ratios and NotesMy notes in the image above sums it up. To get CROIC that is consistent like this, the company must have at least one of the following:A lot of times, CROIC jumps around by huge leaps and crashes which doesn't provide any comfort. For a better view of CROIC, here's a closer look.Consistent CROIC is a great signAdditionally, the balance sheet is clean, quality scores are good, and I love the margins. The quality scores I'm referring to are located at the bottom of the ratios page.Tyler Technologies Quality ScoreNow the ratios show that it is clearly expensive, but I'm not passing on it yet. Your criteria may be to move onto the next company if it's above a certain metric like a P/FCF > 20.However, I like this company and what it does.Competition is very scattered and although major players like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) offer similar solutions, I doubt Oracle will be going after slow moving small schools and governments. A company like Oracle targets a completely different market which makes Tyler Technologies all the more attractive if it comes down in price. Again, I'm making this claim based on having a better understanding of the target market. The numbers also back it up because Oracle's total revenue last year was $37.2 billion. Tyler Technologies is $416m which is just little over 1% of Oracle's revenues. And without a huge fish bothering to eat up the market, Tyler Technologies has enjoyed its place in the industry.That's how you see a stock price chart like this.Getting to valuation, FCF is consistent, profitable so a reverse DCF is a good idea to see what the expectation is. Plugging in the TTM FCF value of $40m with a discount rate of 9%, the required growth rate is 34%.Reverse DCF for TYLDoing the same thing using the Graham Valuation, I get the following.Reverse Graham Valuation Here, an earnings growth of 42% is required. I find that difficult to swallow. With such high growth, any slight dip in earnings or growth is going to have serious negative impact on the stock. I really do like the business but I don't want to be on the wrong side of this one.Tyler Technologies goes into my watchlist. I'll live to fight another day.Disclosure: No positions"

        Pure play on public sector technology infrastructure - wide moat, high margins.
        Underfollowed by analysts, this is an under-the-radar play that individual investors can still get in on before Wall Street.","Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) is a leading provider of integrated software and technology solutions for local public sector governments. The company's products can be found in 13,000 local systems in all fifty states of the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, and the United Kingdom. The company offers a wide breadth of products, including payroll and human resources systems, products for court case management, and public school student information systems. The market for these products is highly decentralized and fragmented. Anyone who has had any exposure to the public systems in their local jurisdiction likely knows how old and inefficient these computer systems are. Government agencies simply cannot attract qualified IT professionals to build and maintain these systems from scratch, leaving the market ripe for external companies to come in and force change. All told this is estimated to be a $14B market - Tyler Technologies controls just 5% of that pie. What has been a major catalyst for change for the company has been a shift from upfront licenses to recurring subscription-based models. The subscription model is both more appealing to governmental agencies (less upfront costs make upgrades easier to get approved) and to shareholders (recurring subscriptions with high retention rates leads to stable revenue streams and highly predictable cash flows). Recurring revenues made up 61% of revenue in 2014, up strongly over past years.Revenue Growth and Cost ControlTyler Technologies is one of the better performing stocks you may not have heard about. Shares are up over 1600% over the past ten years, and results like the above are why. The business model is proving itself to yield higher and higher margins as the company benefits from the leverage of scale. The moat for the company is strong - all the time and energy it took to break into public sector work is paying off. A reputation for excellence in customer service and finishing projects ahead of schedule has given the company a great reputation. All of this initial time investment in developing a moat will keep competitors at bay and provide the opportunity for the company to continue to both grow revenue and improve margins. The dominance the company has in some spaces is intimidating:*Investor Day PresentationThis chart highlights the company's wins against work with competitive bids for their Financial Solutions products (resource planning, general ledger, accounts payable/receivable, etc.). This is all a function of reputation. Strength like this has led to strong backlog growth for the company going into 2015. While backlog is not concrete indication of future revenue growth, backlog in Q1 2015 was up strongly over the year/year comparison:""Our backlog at the end of the quarter was $689.6 million, up 27.6% from last year's Q1. Software-related backlog, which excludes backlog from appraisal services contracts, was $633.4 million, a 24.5% increase. Backlog included $137.9 million of maintenance compared to $117 million a year ago.""- Brian Miller, CFO, Q1 2015 EarningsShare Repurchases and Use of Cash FlowWe've highlighted the excellent cash flow generation capabilities of this company. Since 2002, Tyler Technologies has repurchased 26.1M shares (44% of the 2002 float). The company suspended purchases during 2012 and 2013 to build up cash reserves (approximately $200M). These repurchases resumed in 2014 with $23M in retirement of common stock. Unfortunately, this was only enough to basically offset dilution from options. Management it seems has begun to view the return on investment in shares to not be as good of a deal as in prior years. I can understand some skepticism as the shares have returned 400% over the past four years, well ahead of the S&P 500 as the company has gotten a little more visibility from investors along with the SaaS industry as a whole.""We continue to look at our own stock, which is richer than it's been historically. We continue to look at assets in the marketplace, where valuations are relatively high as well.""- John Marr, CEO, Q1 2015 EarningsI will be interested in seeing what management decides to do with its cash. Company capital expenditures are low and on the acquisition front, the company has only paid $56M in the past five years to acquire relatively small bolt-on acquisitions. As such, pretty much all of cash flow from operations ends up flowing straight to the bank account ($126M in 2014). The company holds no long term debt. I would like to see them put the money to the work but I'm not about to encourage throwing money out into the market just because it is there. The methodical approach management has historically had is what has helped them build such a strong foundation in the first place, and I'm confident that they will manage their cash in the best way they can. Given the light amount of research and development from the income statement above, I think there is ample opportunity here to use some of that cash flow there.ConclusionThe market continues to underestimate the company. Since Q2 2012, the company has beat market expectations in all but two quarters. Unlike most of the market, shares are trading well off recent highs, providing what appears to be a more favorable entry point. While I do not currently own shares, this stock has made it on my (very short) watch list. I believe current fair value for the shares stands at around $146/share, based on my 2016 expected earnings of $3.26 share and a 45x multiple on those earnings. While this multiple is high, it is historically in-line and representative of the company's strong moat position in technology/SaaS, which have long carried higher multiples than the broader market. Considering the valuations given to some players in the space that are not profitable (nor expected to be in the coming years), I'd consider the shares to be a fine value in the space."
1496882,25381,2013-06-12T10:41:30-04:00,,"Despite resulting in great returns for investors, Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) has been under the radar for a long time. The company receives next to no coverage in financial websites and it enjoys only 174 followers at Seeking Alpha. Year-to-date the stock's price has appreciated by 44% and in the last year, it has appreciated by 80%, not to mention the 315% appreciation in the last 3 years. Did investors miss the train with this company?First, I'd like to offer a description of the company since not many people know what it actually does. Tyler Technologies mostly works with local governments and provides them with information management solutions and other integrated services. It conducts business with the financial arms of cities, counties, local agencies and many different arms of municipal courts, departments of planning, licensing and permitting, departments of public safety, schools and departments of documents and records. Because the local governments across the nation have been cutting costs all over the place, many investors were worried that this company would stop growing but it hasn't happened in the last few years.In 2010, Tyler Technologies generated $288 million in revenues of $128 million in gross profits. In 2011, the company generated $309 million in revenues and $142 million in gross profits, followed by $363 million in revenues and $168 million in gross profits in 2012. As per earnings, they were 71 cents per share in 2010, 83 cents per share in 2011 and $1 per share in 2012. We are looking at an earnings growth of 41% in the last 2 years.In the last quarter, there were a lot of positive items in the company's results. The last quarter marked Tyler Technologies' 9th quarter of year-to-year revenue growth and 48th profitable quarter in a row. The recurring revenues represented 62% of total revenues as they grew by nearly 20% in the quarter compared to the same quarter a year ago. Because the company has a subscription model, it doesn't have to always rely on new sales to make money.Moreover, Tyler Technologies makes money on license and royalty payments as it enjoys multiple valuable patents. Last quarter, these revenues were up by 17%, particularly due to a large payment from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) regarding Microsoft Dynamics AX software.Tyler Technologies enjoys 11,000 customers around the country which gives it more than enough room to breathe if it were to lose a few customers due to economic conditions. The company's target market is as large as $11 billion and the market is growing at a 2-3% rate annually, while the company's penetration rate it as little as 3%, which gives it a lot of room for growth. In the long term Tyler's growth rate is expected to be much larger than the market's growth rate, which should allow the company to gain a lot of market share in the years to come.Even though local governments are cutting funding all over the place, Tyler is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years. This may make some people wonder. After all, why would local governments pay more for a contractor when many of them face bankruptcy if they don't cut their costs significantly? Here is the thing: Tyler's products actually help local governments with cutting their costs. Tyler's software products enable organizations to do more with less. Most local governments still use home-grown software that was developed a long time ago and most of this software is getting outdated as we speak.There are many companies like SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) that compete with Tyler Technologies. These companies typically have multiple focuses including national governments, local governments, national companies, local companies and multi-national companies. On the other hand, many companies that only focus on local governments are local players that don't have much market share. Tyler Technologies is one of the few companies that has these two qualities: 1) being nationwide, 2) focusing only on local governments. This allows the company to steal market share from competition.Having a recurring revenue model and high client retention allows the company to remain profitable for a long time. As of right now, Tyler has a customer retention rate of 98%, which is one of the highest rates among companies that serve local governments.The chart below demonstrates how Tyler Technologies has been able to grow its revenues by an average of 14% annually since 2002. Notice that 2013 guidance is in line with the company's ongoing growth, which tells me that the growth rate isn't slowing down anytime soon.When we look at the growth in Tyler's recurring revenues, we see that it is growing at an even faster rate than the company's overall revenues. Since 2007, Tyler's recurring revenues have been growing by an average rate of 18% annually and they currently represent 62% of the company's revenues.Tyler's margins continue to increase as the company's volume goes up. Between 2007 and 2012, the company's gross margin has increased from 38.4% to 46.2%. We are looking at a relative gross margin growth of 20% in 5 years, which is impressive.In the last 5 years, Tyler's cash flow to earnings ratio has been 1.5 which is very strong. The company has been able to spend the money on acquisitions and share buybacks. Since 2007, Tyler has made 13 acquisitions which increased the company's client base as well as the variety of available products. Since 2002, Tyler has repurchased 25.8 million of its outstanding shares. When we consider that the company only has 31.5 million outstanding shares right now, this is a big number. We may be looking at a company that will be able to buy itself and become private within this decade.The company has multiple divisions: Local Government Division, Appraisal and Tax Division, School Division, Microsoft Dynamics Division and Courts and Justice Division.Local Government DivisionThis division provides local governments such as cities, counties and related agencies with tools to run their financials, plan for the future, keep documents and records and improve efficiency overall. Recently, Tyler acquired Energov which provides complimentary products to Tyler's products. The great integration between the products of these two companies will allow Tyler to increase its customer base as well as revenue per customer as it will be able to sell more products to existing customers. Recently, the division secured many solid contracts such as a $4 million contract from Providence of British Columbia Safety Authority in Canada, a $2.7 million contract from Prince William County, Virginia, and a $2.2 million contract from Cedar Rapids, Iowa.Appraisal and Tax DivisionThis division provides software and appraisal services for local governments and their tax departments. In total 55% of the revenues come from software products and 45% of the revenues come from appraisal services. Of the software revenues, 65% are recurring and 35% are one-time revenues. Software is used in 35 different states and 2 different Canadian provinces whereas the appraisal services are offered in 18 states. This division typically enjoys a contract-win rate of 25-40% and it had an exceptional year in 2012 as it enjoyed a win-rate above 50%.Schools DivisionOut of the 13,830 schools in US and Canada, Tyler Technologies has exposure to 1,500 through its VersaTrans solution (software package used for school bus route planning) and 1,000 through its Tyler SIS (software package used for keeping student records) solution. While the company enjoys a significant market share in schools, it still has more than enough room to grow.Microsoft Dynamics DivisionMicrosoft Dynamics is a highly dynamic product that serves more complex clients who need multi-government, multi-language, multi-currency capabilities as well as those clients who need significant customization. The product utilizes Microsoft Office. The partnership between Microsoft and Tyler Technologies combine Microsoft's marketing power with Tyler's specialized knowledge and experiences in the local government sector. The software is easy to learn and use and it is very comprehensive. The software can run many different functions including but not limited to financial management, fund accounting, budgetary control, travel and expense management and business intelligence and reporting.Unlike most of Tyler's other products, this product is being sold across the world. So far, 75 local governments from 35 different countries (4 in North and Central America, 4 in Africa, 2 in Australia, 9 in Asia and 16 in Europe) have adopted this product. The international exposure of the product is mostly due to Microsoft's marketing power. In the 4th quarter of 2012, Tyler generated nearly $1 million from this product which is more than the previous 4 quarters combined together. There is still a lot of room for growth of this product.Courts and Justice DivisionTwelve years ago, Tyler Technologies released a new product called Odyssey Court Case Management Solution. In the last 12 years, the product has gained a lot of market share. States like Oregon, North Dakota, South Dakota, Indiana, New Mexico, Maryland, New Hampshire, 3 counties in California, 2 counties in Nevada, more than 70 counties in Texas, 3 counties in Michigan, 1 county in Illinois and several counties in other states utilize this product today. There are still many places across the country that could use this product, which gives it a lot of room for growth.The company has products for many different types of people in the court system. Case managers, jail managers, attorneys and supervisors can find products designed by Tyler to meet their needs in the court system. Tyler's dataXchange software allows courts to share information with each other, which helps with solving many cases more efficiently. Furthermore, there are many counties, cities and states that utilize different Tyler solutions to allow their residents to utilize E-filing, which allows many forms to be filled electronically without actually going to the court building. In addition to these products, the company offers many smartphone apps, which allow users to be mobile.Now I can hear you saying ""what about the high P/E ratio Jacob?"" Tyler's trailing P/E ratio is 65. The estimates and guidance for 2013 imply a forward P/E ratio of 55. For 2014, we are looking at a P/E ratio of 48. If the company were to grow its earnings by 20% annually, we'd be looking at forward P/E ratios of 44 by 2015, 35 by 2016, 28 by 2017, 22 by 2018, 18 by 2019 and 14 by 2020. It would take a lot of growth for many years to justify the company's current share price. While the company has a solid growth story, I would wait until there is a correction/pullback before buying it. An entry level around mid to high $50s would present a great opportunity for this company.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1015841,23899,2012-11-17T15:22:06-05:00,,"By Jay PeroniNow that President Barack Obama has been re-elected, many fear his vision of big-government planning, spending and taxing. But what is so bad about big government anyway? The problem is, with a growing government comes growing expenses. And these days, the United States is sitting on the edge of a much-talked-about ""fiscal cliff"" that could make a huge dent on its financial status. Simply put, the country can't afford to keep spending like it has.But not all is lost: This major disconnect could mean a tremendous opportunity for savvy investors to make at least a 40% return.You don't have to go too farIf you look closely at state and local government budgets, then you'll see how their problems only get worse. Though state tax revenue is picking up, mandated spending obligations and reduced federal stimulus are placing a heavy burden on budgets.Imagine the size of the hole in the pockets of these local governments during the past few years as they incurred less revenue from lower property values, and endured cutbacks in federal and state aid. In addition, some states have seen a mass exodus of people, which results in less income tax collection.Unlike the federal government, states are required by law to balance their budgets. Many states have already addressed nearly $431 billion in gaps from 2009-2011. Fiscal 2012 appears to be one of the toughest on record, as 44 states and the District of Columbia anticipate budget deficits totaling more than $112 billion. To cut deficits, the solution is seemingly simple: Raise revenue (mainly through tax collection) and reduce spending.And many as cities, counties, schools and other local government offices struggle through this fiscal crisis, many others have been increasingly drawing toward technology as a method to conserve and control spending. One of the fastest-growing sectors in this arena is software firms that provide financial management solutions to the public sector.Tyler Technologies  TYL is one of the leaders in this segment. Its software provides tools for accounting and financial management of public records and judicial cases, and for automating appraisals and assessments. The company has provided appraisal services and tax software solutions to virtually every public entity in the country. Its expert teams stay in touch with evolving legislation and assessment practices to provide superior service and data to many states across the country.During the past five years, this stock has averaged annual growth of 25%, and I don't see it slowing down during the next four years. It even managed to stay afloat during the bear market of 2008-2009 and soared thereafter. Take a look at the stock's performance in the chart below...Part of the reason the stock held up so nicely during the Great Recession is because its software services are in high demand, especially during bad economies, when state and local offices need all the revenue they can collect. To date, Tyler Technologies has a total client base of more than 10,000 local government offices, which are distributed throughout all 50 states, Canada, the Caribbean and the United Kingdom. The company recently signed promising contracts, including one with Nevada's Truckee Meadows Water Authority to provide business management software in collaboration with Microsoft MSFT through a product called Microsoft Dynamics.In the past year, revenue grew 21.6% to $93.8 million in comparison with the previous year. Third-quarter earnings exceeded expectations by 18.7%, totaling 33 cents per share. As a result, analysts have increased their price target by almost 19% from $43.50 to $51.60. I see the stock reaching the $60-range due to the fact that it has consistently delivered 20% or higher annualized gains for more than a decade.A risk to consider; during the past 90 days, Tyler's standard deviation has been 1.7, while that of the S&P 500 Index has been only 0.7., showing it has more volatility than the overall market. Additionally, Tyler is in the technology sector, which can see sharper price swings based on economic news.Buy Tyler Technologies up to $50 a share. I see this stock hitting $60-$65 during the next 12 months, which would be a nice 40% gain from current levels. With governments of all sizes around the country struggling to find solutions to save money, Tyler Technologies is well-positioned to continue to deliver outstanding returns for its shareholders, and is an excellent small-cap option for investors to investigate further.Original articleDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

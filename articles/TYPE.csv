Most people don't, overlooking font vendor Monotype (NASDAQ:TYPE), which has a leading position in the provision of fonts and related software to rasterize/scale them to ensure legibility regardless of the user's screen.Source: Kuyrebik, Wikimedia CommonsWhile Monotype is an interesting backdoor play on the growth of both digital content consumption and the number of connected devices (from cars to wearables), the near to medium-term growth rate will likely be more challenged by declining printer unit shipments than management is willing to admit. Between that and a lack of clear operating leverage over the same time period, while I do like this company and view its long-term growth story as credible, I think investors should wait on a better entry point since shares look expensive at this juncture.The Good News: Growth Areas Are Growing; HTML5 Finally HereOne of the two big growth drivers for Monotype is its Creative Professional segment, serving content creators from brands to marketing agencies. The adoption of Monotype's ""web fonts"" has been strong; they not only improve website performance relative to utilizing pixelated images of text, but also allow higher legibility, less design work, and consistent branding across device types (offering users the same experience whether in a mobile app or on a desktop website). Web fonts are already at a $20 million run rate (from merely $4-$5 million in 2012) and halfway to the midpoint of the company's estimate of $30-$50 million in revenue potential.The long-awaited arrival of HTML5 will underpin continued double-digit growth in this segment. The move from Flash to HTML5 has been discussed for years, but there's finally a date in sight. On both the ad side and the browser side, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google is pushing hard to make the transition happen by year-end. There's a good explanation of the applications of web fonts in HTML5 advertisements here; the benefits are similar to those discussed for websites. In fact, the recent revision of the Interactive Advertising Bureau digital advertising guidelines document includes language around webfonts (see pages 9-10) which Monotype helped write. All in all, this portion of the business is tracking well, and I don't see any immediate reason why growth should slow down in the near term from the teens CAGR the company has been posting.Over the medium term, though, the one area I am concerned about - and it's admittedly small - is the acquired Swyft Media business. The frequency with which management mentions emojis makes me nervous, and I'm concerned they may be vastly overestimating the staying power of this market. Swyft has two sides to its business: the first is the ad campaign side of the business, in which Swyft uses themed stickers to help promote brands that are willing to pay up. A lot of this business is event-driven (i.e. album or product launches), but I do view it as relatively recurring and growthy in nature - there's clearly a seismic shift ongoing in digital advertising, and most major Fortune 500 brands are keen to explore new platforms and reach consumers (especially young consumers) in a more natural state.On the other hand, the other part of Swyft's business is selling branded stickers to consumers. While this is popular right now and is seemingly supported by major messaging platforms, which have few tenable ways to financially justify their massive valuations, the history of similar microtransaction-content businesses is not pretty. Two come to mind: first, anyone remember Farmville? Second, and perhaps more directly comparable due to the personalization component: anyone remember ringtones? They were once a big profit center, but now nobody cares. Indeed, even emoji homeland Japan - where cultural phenomena like kawaii long underpinned their popularity - may no longer be as enthralled with them as they once were.OEM: The Future Is Half-Bright...The other half of the company's business is the OEM segment, wherein Monotype licenses its fonts and accompanying software to device manufacturers to help them improve legibility on their devices. While Monotype's biggest competitor is always ""free"" alternatives which are good enough for many applications, I do think there's a meaningful value proposition underpinning continued high single- or low double-digit growth for half of this segment. (The other half - or slightly more - of this segment is related to printers, which I'll discuss in the next section.)The cost of Monotype's solutions on a per-unit basis is very low - we're usually talking a few basis points, at most, in the context of the overall design cost - yet the payoff for consumers for increased legibility is very high, particularly on small wearable devices like the Fitbit (NYSE:FIT) and in applications like automotive infotainment systems, where users aren't (or at least shouldn't be) staring at their screens rather than the road for more than a few seconds. Looking out farther, while the market is still currently nascent, if virtual reality does indeed take off the way some expect it to, this would likely provide credible future growth opportunities for Monotype. (On the other hand, I would point to the quiet shutdown of Google Glass as a reason to be cautious in your assumptions around this space.)One potential long-term challenge is increasing penetration of voice or gesture control rather than text - obviously, if users are interacting with devices in non-text-based ways, that reduces the value proposition for Monotype's offerings. Amazon Echo and Google Home are good examples of what this could look like in the home automation portion of the IoT market, and I do believe that voice or gestures will prove to be a more natural way of controlling things within the home than staring at tiny screens on your toaster and refrigerator.On the other hand, for mobile applications, Siri and ""Okay Google"" have hardly negated the need for Monotype's offerings, and I don't think anyone reasonable would expect that we'll stop staring at screens anytime soon. With that, while I don't really view voice/gesture control as a meaningful ""threat"" to its business, it could take a few points off the growth curve in the long term - which is important to think about given the sensitivity of growth companies' valuations to their exact growth rate.Finally, there's also the risk that free fonts continue to get better and creative professionals increasingly find these to be a good alternative - frankly, the ""toll"" charged by Monotype is pretty small, so I'm not too concerned here, but it's another factor to watch.Over The Next Few Years, Printers Are The ProblemWhile the outlook for connected devices is strong, I'm not sure that will actually translate into consolidated revenue growth for the OEM segment. Indeed, despite strong gains in auto and wearables, the OEM segment saw revenue fall 3% in 2015, as soft printer sales offset these gains. 60% of revenue in the OEM segment, and thus about 30% of the company's total revenue, comes from printers.I believe management's medium- to long-term assumptions here are woefully optimistic. From both transcript-reading and direct interaction, I've detected a relatively consistent trend of Pollyannaism from many executives in and around the printing industry. Like the head-in-the-sand Blockbuster executives discussed by Scott Fearon in his witty memoir Dead Companies Walking, I've found that those whose businesses have significant exposure to printing seem to live in their own little world and believe that the printer market will stabilize or even grow.To this end, around the 9-minute mark on the webcast, Monotype CEO Scott Landers made the following statement at the recent B. Riley conference:Clearly, I'm not important enough to be included in Landers' survey, but count me as an exception to that ""nobody."" Cold hard data - both recent and from years past - suggests that the rate of decline in print volumes is not going to let up. I've discussed some of my favorite suspects before, but as a brief review - small-cap ARC Document Solutions (NYSE:ARC) can't seem to find any growth in Managed Print Services despite its diminutive size. Tyler Technologies (NYSE:TYL) keeps racking up impressive wins with its justice system software and consistently notes a move away from paper. HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) just reported an appallingly dreadful quarter on the printer side, with revenues down 16% (and still 10% adjusting for currency). Lexmark (NYSE:LXK) is being acquired for a price below that at which it traded as recently as last summer, hardly suggesting boundless optimism by that company's management team and Board of Directors.Reading between the lines, I believe what's going on in printers is similar to what's going on in PCs - as people print less and less, replacement cycles for hardware are likely to elongate. In fact, there's a double-whammy here - beyond the ease of document review on screens, the continuing content consumption shift from PCs to mobile devices makes printing less likely. When was the last time you printed something from your smartphone?I openly admit that my perspective here may be colored by my diagnosable allergy to working with physical paper - but indeed, that's sort of the point, isn't it? The medium- to long-term future of the printer market is, in many respects, the exact inverse of the ""graying of America"" trend; every Baby Boomer who retires and joins the Social Security roll is replaced in the workforce by a Millennial who came of age with their nose in a smartphone. Moreover, given mobile device adoption in emerging markets, I imagine they will probably ""leapfrog"" printers entirely.I don't want to belabor this point, because you can look at the numbers yourself and either believe me or not. More important is what it means for Monotype if I'm correct. If the printer market continues to consistently decline at low to mid single digits - or worse, accelerates to a mid-high-single digit decline in some years - then Monotype could be looking at flat OEM revenues, or at best low single-digit gains. In Q1, for example, OEM revenue increased merely 2% (vs. management's 3-5% targeted long-term growth rate), and they're still only expecting 7% growth for the entire company for the full year even after an easy comp from last year (4%).Even if you assume continued robust growth from the Creative Professional segment, just looking at the weight of the printer business, it would in total only be enough to get you to high single-digit or at very best low double-digit growth over the next few years. This will be less of a factor in the long term - but then too, the growth curve of areas like Web Fonts and HTML5 will likely flatten out over time, and it doesn't seem reasonable to expect the Creative Professional business to grow at a high-teens rate forever.Valuation: Absent Margin Expansion, Shares Don't Look FairInvestors sometimes seem to forget that incremental margins work pretty much the same way going down as they do going up. Perhaps my biggest challenge with Monotype is that the company doesn't seem to be posting the sort of operational leverage to the upside you would expect given its revenue growth. While the company does note that it's investing several points of EBITDA margin into emerging areas like HTML5 and Swyft, I think the nuance here is this: operating leverage is likely to be achieved on a segment-by-segment basis, and deleverage from areas like printers (where you still have to maintain certain infrastructure even as revenues are falling) will likely offset the leverage inherent in areas like Web Fonts/HTML5.Putting it all together, I don't see meaningful EBITDA margin expansion over the near term, nor do I see a path to consistent double-digit revenue growth over the next few years. With that, the company looks fairly expensive; the current price just shy of $24 implies a multiple of around ~14x this year's guided EBITDA. (Note that I subtract estimated stock-based compensation from the company's guidance for Adjusted EBITDA, as I view stock comp as a very real expense that dilutes shareholders' returns). Near-term cash flow is benefited by the deductibility of some goodwill, but over time I would expect the company's cash tax rate to approximate its effective tax rate, and with the EV coming in at a low-mid-20s multiple of NOPAT, I'd really need to see higher growth to consider the valuation fair on the basis of long-term free cash flow.This sort of multiple would be justified if the printer business didn't exist, but unfortunately, it does - and that will drag on the double-digit growth likely achievable by the other half of the OEM business and the creative professional business. The good news is that this drag will lessen in impact over time as printers become an increasingly small portion of the revenue mix, but the growth rate in other areas will likely fall as well. All in all, while this is a solid story with plenty of aspects to like, the free cash flow yield simply isn't high enough for a business that seems to have high single-digit growth prospects at best over the near term.Final ThoughtsMonotype is an underfollowed business well worth keeping on your radar; I particularly like management's focus on licensing per use case (rather than universally) to protect their ability to drive future revenue streams as technology evolves. There aren't too many credible global competitors other than free fonts and in-house development, and for now, those risks don't seem to be material enough to disrupt the growth story. At a more modest price that baked in reasonable expectations around printer TAM declines, I'd be happy to own this company - but unfortunately, we have quite a ways to go to get there.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

4141847,104119,2018-01-31T14:46:36-05:00,"If investors can receive a higher yield from the risk-free rate than from a stock, in my opinion, investors would be better off buying that T-Bill.TYPE has a profit margin of just 0.06%, earnings that are almost perfectly negatively correlated with revenue, a capital structure made up more than 50% of goodwill, and more.Despite a value-destroying acquisition decision from management, management is profiting just fine, thank you.Sometimes, things are ""out-of-the-way"" for good reason. TYPE is, in my opinion, one of them. I advise investors to avoid TYPE.","I love covering out-of-the-way companies, in the hope that some value can be found there, a gleaming hidden forest gem of a company. But sometimes, a destination is ""out-of-the-way"" for a reason. Monotype Imaging Holdings (TYPE) is one of those companies.As per its 10-Q, TYPE derives its revenue primarily from licensing fonts (its ""Creative Professional"" revenue) and licensing text imaging solutions (its ""OEM"" revenue). TYPE offers more than 99,000 typeface designs to be licensed - including Times New Roman, Helvetica, Frutiger, and ITC Franklin Gothic - on its e-commerce websites such as myfonts.com and fonts.com.Source: 8-KDespite its SaaS model, which should, in my opinion, enable a lot of scalable profits, TYPE struggles to turn its SaaS operations into bottom line value for investors.To start, let's look at the growing chasm between TYPE's revenue and net income.TYPE is one of those uniquely situated companies whose sales and earnings TTM are nearly-perfectly correlated - negatively - to a point of -0.97.TYPE Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsIndeed, this trend seems to be strengthening, as its total expenses are growing as a percentage of revenue - correlated - positively this time! - to a point of 0.986.With growing revenue and decreasing net income, that prompts me to ask the eternal question: if growing sales won't lead to increased earnings, what will? Profitability is critical to a company's long-term success, and no business can survive for long without profitability. With total expenses nearly outstripping revenue, it's hard to see how this situation will turn around in upcoming quarters.TYPE's revenue per employee has taken a figurative nosedive, as well. Low revenue per employee indicates poor use of company resources. In a similar vein, profit margin is at a five-year low of just 0.06%:TYPE Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsA declining profit margin highlights the yuuuge uncertainty of TYPE's future profits. With its current TTM profit margin at 0.06% - meaning, just $0.06 per dollar of sales translates into profits - any uptick in expenses could cause a negative profit margin for TYPE investors - that is, netting a loss with each dollar of sales.To highlight the issue, let's look at TYPE's acquisition of Olapic.To refresh everyone's memory, goodwill is the intangible asset that arises when, generally speaking, a company pays more for an acquired business than the assets of that business are worth. Excess goodwill is generally considered a risk for shareholders, as goodwill can become impaired. This is a risk for TYPE, as goodwill makes up a significant percentage of its capital structure, with over 53% of its balance sheet comprised of goodwill.Source: YCharts Quarterly Data, Author's WorkWith so much of its capital structure comprised of goodwill, that puts shareholders at risk. For, if its goodwill becomes impaired, the company suffers an immediate hit to earnings, as ""assets"" evaporate.TYPE's purchase of Olapic didn't help goodwill-related matters. Olapic was a startup company that helped brands promote themselves with user-generated photos. Before being acquired by TYPE, Olapic was itself struggling to generate a profit.Source: Company FilingsAnd this probably won't change in the near-future, as TYPE states in its 10-Q.Not strong words of encouragement for a company TYPE bought for $123m. Looking at the purchase financials, for $123m, I hoped to find some huge gems: a good amount of PP&E and technology, tangible assets and identifiable intangibles, customer relationships. Instead, the single greatest contributor to the purchase price is Olapic's goodwill (the premium amount it has paid to acquire companies above their tangible value).Indeed, TYPE's purchase was comprised of 72% of goodwill.That doesn't leave a lot left over if its goodwill becomes impaired. And for a company that is expected to operate at a net loss, a premium purchase price is, in my opinion, not acceptable value-creation for shareholders. Only 38% of the purchase went to things beyond Olapic's goodwill.Source: Company 10-QThis puts TYPE investors at risk of that goodwill being impaired and shareholder value being destroyed. The decision to purchase Olapic represents, in my opinion, a failure of management to maximize shareholder value.So let's talk about management.Despite these goodwill concerns, management has opted to engage in the noble task of share buybacks. As I strongly discourage investors from investing in dilutive companies, this is something I like to see.Source: Company 10-QShare buybacks at the right price are a noble pursuit. The problem for shareholders of TYPE is that these share buybacks are not actually reducing the number of shares outstanding.TYPE Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Annual) data by YChartsThis, in my opinion, is due to simultaneous increases in stock-based compensation. Indeed, average shares outstanding is still on the rise. In fact, share-based compensation per share and acquisition compensation per share exceeds net income per share.Source: 10-QInvestors would do well to ask themselves whether this is a company run for management or for investors. During fiscal 2016, its CEO, Scott E. Landers, alone took home over $3m in total compensation. You can see the breakdown below:Source: Salary.comThat is to say, during fiscal 2016, TYPE's CEO took home roughly a quarter of what the entire company netted for investors.Source: YChartsInvestors can consider for themselves whether this level of compensation for this level of performance is acceptable. I don't believe that it is.Some investors may buy TYPE for its dividend yield of about 1.89%. Yet investors may want to be wary of the sustainability of this dividend. The dividend payout ratio can be calculated by dividing the yearly dividend per share by the company's net income per share.TYPE Dividend Per Share (Annual) data by YChartsFor fiscal 2016, its payout ratio was 116%, meaning that very little money was retained by the company to reinvest in operations or reduce debt.For investors looking for bottom-line growth, TYPE may have a difficult time delivering without some significant operational cutbacks.Taking the reciprocal of TYPE's Ev/EBIT - 189.45 - we come to an earnings yield for TYPE of just 0.5%. At that low yield, investors would be better off looking for returns in a T-Bill, which is yielding about 2%. If an investor can get a higher yield from the risk-free rate, in my opinion, TYPE is not worth taking the excess risk.If investors can receive a higher yield from the risk-free rate than from a higher-risk, low-earnings stock, in my opinion, investors would be better off buying that T-Bill. With a profit margin of just 0.06%, earnings that are almost perfectly negatively correlated with revenue, high amounts of goodwill in its capital structure, high total expenses growing in tandem with revenue while net income stagnates, a yield that doesn't beat the risk-free rate, and management profiting just fine, thank you, despite all these issues, I recommend that investors stay away from TYPE."
3233096,88616,2015-06-03T10:45:56-04:00,"Shortfall in recent quarter has depressed share price.
        The company will weather the storm just fine.
        Future revenue streams look promising, but will likely not come on line this year.","As the title states, you, dear reader, are almost certainly a source of income for Monotype (NASDAQ:TYPE). In fact, you probably represent not just a one time payment but a diverse portfolio of revenue for the company. Do you own a car manufactured in the last few years? Do you have a smart phone? Have you seen a Nike ad? Monotype has a hand in all of those things.Monotype describes itself as, ""a leading global provider of typefaces, technology and expertise that enable the best user experience and ensure brand integrity."" In the modern era, this mostly means they hold the rights to the code that allows content creators to produce a certain style of text and that allows the end user's device to accurately depict it. They own all of the fonts you've heard of-- Helvetica, Arial, Times New Roman--plus twenty thousand others you had no idea existed.Interestingly, it is the technological rather than aesthetic aspect of Monotype's fonts which hold the most appeal. There are plenty of free fonts, which, as CEO Doug Shaw admitted during the B. Riley Investor Conference, are visually comparable to those in Monotype's portfolio. However, he went on to explain that an engineer likely notice a dramatic difference as Monotype's fonts are optimized in ways that help programs run more smoothly and can scale in ways that maintain readability on small and/or low resolution devices. In fact, their webfont division has been experiencing a bit of a tail wind lately because tweaks Google has made to its search algorithm. Now, when searching from a mobile device, sites that are able to adapt themselves efficiently like Monotype's will be favored, creating an obvious incentive for adoption.This most recent quarter was a rough one for Monotype, and the share price floundered accordingly, falling from about $33 dollars per share to where it now resides in the mid 20s. The major issue was an unexpected drop in printer sales, particularly in China. In both the quarter conference call and the B. Riley Q&A session it was suggested that this could be indicative of a longer term trend. This resulted in the company projecting only a 4% increase in revenue for the year despite a traditional 12% growth rate. However, company executives remained hopeful for two reasons.First, at the time of Monotype's IPO, OEM sales, meaning those related to end user's devices rather than creators, accounted for approximately 75% of the company's business and printers were the vast majority of that number. More recently the distribution of revenues has moved both away from OEM generally and from printers specifically. The significance is that this drop off is much less damaging than it might have been in the past.Secondly, the company has seen this type of activity before. In the OEM market, products are constantly cycling in and out. Only a few years ago, Monotype was generating revenues from GPS and digital camera displays. Now those devices are relics but they have been supplanted by things like automotive dashboard and center console displays. There is no immediate candidate for what item will pick up the slack in the printing market, but if history is any indication something will show up to help plug the gap.Taken together, the two points certainly don't prove that the drop in sales related to printer distribution is a good thing, just that it is possible that the obstacle will be overcome. The creative professional unit, associated with the creators of content, is now nearly 50% of the company and is expected to grow somewhere around 15% this fiscal year. Success there if combined with a rise in non-printer OEM revenue could be enough to drag the overall company growth rate back to its traditional level.In the short run, even if things continue unchanged, the company is in a totally secure financial position. Monotype holds no debt and has 78 million in cash. They also pay a dividend which is easily covered by operating cashflow and has actually recently been raised by 25%.Frankly, I wouldn't expect anything to change in the short run, and for that reason I see little incentive to invest in Monotype if you have a narrow investing horizon. The product that will pick up the revenue being lost in printers hasn't emerged yet, and their most exciting new sector, which I will discuss shortly, is only expected to contribute a few million in revenue this year. However, I would not be surprised if these things totally turned around in 2016 and beyond.The two trends that bode well for the company's future are the emergence of the Internet of Things and people's infatuation with emoticons.The Internet of Things comprises the existing and continued push toward a world where everything is connected--think using your phone to preheat the oven on the way home from work, or having a wearable device sense your perspiration and adjust your home's air conditioning. As more and more of these devices become part of the network, there will most likely be proportional increases digital displays that use Monotype fonts.In the kitchen alone, ovens and refrigerators are just beginning to have interactive interfaces, and it's a small leap from there to lesser items like toasters with personalized settings for each member of the family. Really, anything with power could end up with a Monotype powered display, and even if no individual item represents a major revenue stream, together the impact on the company's income statement could be significant.Monotype's fonts will be critical for many of these devices because manufacturers not only need type that looks good but that places minimal constraints on the design of the system. To this end, the company has a solution called Spark which allows fonts to be used without taking up critical device memory, and it is already in use in many of their automotive displays.While the company waits for the Internet of Things to develop, they are also on the forefront of monetizing messaging services. How to advertise in a conversation between friends without creating a feeling of intrusion is a riddle many businesses are trying to solve, and in February Monotype acquired a company that may have figured it out. Swyft Media creates and distributes custom emoticons across all major messaging platforms, and they earn revenue either through sales of licensed products or ad campaigns. Critically, their presence in conversations doesn't feel unwelcome because consumers are actively opting in.Here's an example of how an ad campaign might work:McDonald's distributes a pack of free emoticons across Swyft's network of messaging platforms, and users download them because they look amusing. Then, the next time someone is hungry and wants to hit up a fast food restaurant with their friend, instead of texting ""Hey, u hungry,"" they send a picture of fries and a burger with just a question mark. The pictures, of course, are branded with the golden arches or some similar corporate logo. As a result, not only has McDonald's essentially advertised within a private conversation, but the company, gets valuable analytics regarding the number of times each image was sent.As previously stated, management does not believe that this segment of the business will produce any meaningful revenue this fiscal year, but I see this as a major component of the business going forward. Not only does it create a new advertising space, but it's the quintessential ""me too"" product for marketing. If McDonald's has a picture of one of its burgers available for use, every other burger place will need to either follow suit or accept a McDonald's burger as the universal image for the product they sell.It looks like, for as much as Monotype is already sneakily following people throughout their day, it will soon be even more ubiquitous. The company is not a particularly exciting a buy today, nor does it seem it will be for the rest of the year, but with a growing creative professional division, the inexorable rise of the Internet of Things, and the advertising solution it has for the messaging market, its future is still bright."
3498066,54942,2015-09-10T08:23:35-04:00,"We believe the market is unfairly hitting the OEM business too negatively given the weakness in the printer market, while ignoring the growth in ISV and automotive.Creative Professional continues to grow very strongly and should benefit from new HTML5 adoption for web-based publishing.The company has been making several acquisitions in new areas of the business that we think contain upside optionality over the long term.","The recent selloff in the shares of Monotype Imaging Holdings (NASDAQ:TYPE) is presenting a solid entry opportunity, as we believe the market is overstating the OEM business's secular decline. The company was founded in 1887 and owns the largest library of fonts and generates revenue from the licensing fees when others use those fonts. The typical end-users are newspapers, web publishers, graphic design studios, Microsoft Office, and other digital advertisements.OEM Weakness ExaggeratedThe business is organized into two segments: OEM licensing and Creative Professional. The former generates revenue from consumer device sales that incorporate the fonts into their products. The business has historically been driven by the growth in the laser printer market as well as growth in mobile, tablets and other devices. But the market essentially entails any device that contains a screen or prints onto paper. This includes copiers, e-books, cameras, and the emerging wearables industry.The segment generates revenue on a per device sold basis with the company generating a small fee of approximately $0.10 per shipped device. With the business generating approximately 55% of revenue, it is an important part of the thesis. We believe the decline is overstated as the printers headwind is starting to subside and will be offset by growth in other devices. The segment is effectively three parts: laser printers, consumer electronics/automotive, and independent software vendors.The market has been discounting the business as a secular declining market mostly due to the decline in laser printers. We chalk up the decline of printers, which thrived in the 1990s in the shift to inkjets and lasers, due to the advent of tablets and the cloud. With cloud-based storage services, consumers no longer have to print their pictures or other documents and can instead have their high-resolution images at their fingertips with their mobile devices. We think this segment will decline over time but will slowly be offset by growth elsewhere.One of the main drivers is likely to come from the automotive segment which is growing very strongly. Auto dashboards are going to all have head-up displays and re-view cameras by May 1, 2018. This rule passed by the Department of Transportation is going to require that all 17 million new cars sold each year have these displays, generating significant revenue for the company.Lastly, in the independent software space, vendors like Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, and Apple are still growing strongly. This business specifically deals with wholesale packages of fonts for computer software packages.The market is incorporating a decline in this market as the laser printer industry continues its secular decline. We believe that the business will stabilize in the near term - there are already signs of this occurring with second-quarter revenue down just 4% with strong growth in ISVs offsetting the decline in printers. The company continues to add new major automotive brands as customers which we think will drive the device category going forward.Creative Professional Remains The Main DriverThe main growth engine for the company is its Creative Professional segment, which sells fonts individually to brands, agencies, publishers, corporations, enterprises, small businesses and even individuals. This segment should overtake the OEM business in terms of size possibly as early as next year, up from just 20% in 2011. This is a much higher growth segment with the company stating it sees a 15% to 20% CAGR over the next several years. As the segment has now reached size, we think it will help offset the slow-to-no growth OEM business and move the consolidated company to a new growth trajectory.(Source: Investor Presentation)The segment has three sub-segments: desktop fonts, web-based publishing, and custom. The web fonts business is the fastest growing due to constraints in pre-packaged software that incorporates only a limited number of font types. The cornerstone of the company's e-commerce and web business is the Monotype Libraries, a large collection of fonts licensed to graphic design professionals as well as casual users for a few cents per month.We think the business will be driven by the web shift towards HTML5-based solutions for digital marketing. As advertising shifts from print and TV towards a web-based and digital media environment, we think Monotype is correctly structured to take advantage of this trend. With HTML5, video becomes part of the page and isn't simply a foreign body shoved onto the page using a flash plug-in.We see the Creative Professional segment growing at a mid-teens rate for at least the next three years driven by the web publishing business. The HTML5 adoption within the web publishing industry should allow for greater consumption of its per-download web-based fonts.Acquisitions Add New Potential Revenue StreamsIn February of this year, the company acquired Swyft Media for $27 million. Swyft is a recent start-up that sells stickers and emojis, but is directed towards mobile messaging applications. The company develops mobile advertising apps for over 300 brands including Sony (NYSE:SNE), Fox (NASDAQ:FOX), MGM (NYSE:MGM), and Dreamworks (NASDAQ:DWA). The acquisition will add approximately $3 million to revenue but be a slight drag to EBITDA this year. While it is hard to peg a long-term value on the acquisition, we like the very fast-growing market with a reach to consumers with personalized mobile content.In July of last year, the company acquired FontShop, a German-based typeface provider, for $13 million. This was another tuck-in acquisition that we think strengthens them within the European marketplace. This business was profitable upon purchase and was done at 1.5x revenue and 8.7x EBITDA.Prior to that, the company purchased a U.K.-based privately-held web design studio for $1.75 million. The firm was a leading provider of typefaces, technology and expertise for creative applications and consumer devices. It also acquired Design By Font in 2012 for $5 million and Bitstream for $42.5 million. The latter was a big move for the company into the world of digital typography and provided it entry into the web-based business more strongly.We view these acquisitions as long-term call options into the evolving web-based digital font technology industry. While it is hard to value these with any degree of accuracy, given the prices paid and the marginal profitability of a few of the acquisitions, we think the upside is far greater than the downside.ValuationThe shares are down 26% with a large part of the drop coming in early May, when the company missed analyst estimates. Adjusted EPS came in at $0.26 versus expectations of $0.27, which led to a 14% drop in one day in the shares. We like this as a solid entry point with the company on the verge of what we think is a significant inflection point as the OEM business stabilizes and the Creative Professional segment becomes the largest piece of the total business growing at an exceptional rate.We think the market and the minimal sell-side presence are too bearish on the back of the OEM weakness. Our contention is that the sell-off is overdone and that the OEM business is likely to return to growth as the printer headwind subsides and the automotive and ISV segments more than offset the printer weakness. We believe the OEM segment can grow in mid-single digits over the next several years, while the Creative Professional segment continues to grow at a mid-teens rate.We think the company can grow earnings at 13% per year and EBITDA at least at 10%. In the model we were much more conservative on that growth in order to incorporate a margin of safety. We also used a 14x multiple, well below the 16x-18x range the shares traded at for most of the last two years. We believe the stock is conservatively worth $28 and using more bullish and likely realistic estimates, worth north of $32, for a significant upside possibility.ConclusionMonotype is a sleepy, under-the-radar name that we think is on the cusp of a new growth trajectory through its Creative Professional division. The segment is highly levered to the fast-growing web-based publishing market which is growing by some estimates at 50% per year. With the Creative Professional segment growing upwards of 20% per year and likely to be more than 50% of revenue next year, the contribution from the segment should continue to increase. Meanwhile, we believe too much negative sentiment has been applied to its OEM licensing business, which used to be heavily levered to the consumer printer market. We think this is overly exaggerated, as the business is likely to see strong growth from its automotive and ISV end-markets. The OEM business is likely to cease being a headwind and we believe it could provide a mid-single digit revenue growth driver. We think the shares are highly mispriced and worth nearly $30."
3994099,56112,2016-08-02T09:58:55-04:00,"Based on my years of following the digital marketing space, Monotype's acquisition of Olapic looks extremely value destructive.But the market may not have punished shares enough, as they still look modestly overvalued even excluding the eight figures a year Monotype will burn on Olapic.If I pretend Olapic doesn't exist, I can justify a price around $17-$18 against today's price of ~$20.But given management's empire-building ambitions and lack of fiscal discipline, it would be hard for me to like these shares (even from a growth perspective) without a deep discount.","After a pretty shocking decision to acquire an early-stage digital marketing company that sent the stock down a good 20%, font vendor Monotype (NASDAQ:TYPE) epitomizes not one, but two cautionary tales. Be careful paying up for growth, and pay attention to capital allocation.While hindsight is 20/20, I should have placed a little more emphasis on that latter issue in my write-up last quarter. I correctly identified the challenged trends in the printer market, which look set to continue - I believe big research firms and industry participants alike have and will continue to be consistently too optimistic.On the other hand, I think the big question shareholders have to ask themselves now is this: is Monotype a classic good-company-wasteful-management situation? In other words, setting aside the growth in their core business (which seems well-underpinned), however you choose to value that, how do you put a price on boneheaded capital allocation?The market seems to expect this will continue, wiping out over $200 million of enterprise value since the announcement of the Olapic deal, against total consideration of $150 million - a statement, in other words, that not only is the deal value-destructive, but the market expects more value destruction in the future:That puts Monotype's valuation in an interesting spot. Even accounting for the close of the acquisition in Q3 2016, you can make a case for Monotype shares being close to fairly valued on the merits of its business as it exists today (if you ignore future cash burn from Olapic and assume it's worth zero - i.e. that they'll either get it to break-even within a short span of time or write it off as a failed project). If you believe Olapic won't be a complete train wreck (which is my base-case assumption), then you could argue that Monotype shares are fairly valued today, and this is a backdoor play on the rise of content and digital marketing.I don't find those arguments convincing, though, particularly in light of the unquantifiable intangible - management's future capital allocation. With that, I think even valuation-insensitive growth investors should be very cautious on this name, as my many years of following the digital marketing space lead me to believe that Monotype's empire-building ambitions will end painfully for shareholders.Breaking Down The Olapic DealUsually, when there's an ugly headline, doing the work on the details can reveal why things aren't so bad as they first appear - or vice versa. In the case of Olapic, unfortunately, the more I dig into the business, the less I like it.To level-set, Olapic is a startup digital marketing business that offers brands a systematic process for identifying high-quality user-generated content, then obtaining the rights for it and using it as marketing collateral. Essentially, say your kid posts a picture of their Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) latte or American Eagle (NYSE:AEO) hoodie on Instagram (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), or another social media platform.Through a combination of algorithmic analysis and human curation/selection, Olapic would figure out if the image is worth using or not, then surface it for the brand manager. Continuing on the path it blazed with the Swyft (emoji) deal - which, as you'll recall, I also didn't like one bit - Monotype has made it clear that it wants to go empire-building and expand well beyond its historically protected niche of fonts into the much more competitive, lower-return world of digital marketing.Although more details are available on Olapic's website, there are three key takeaways investors should note here. The first is that this seems like a solution in search of a problem. While Monotype (and Olapic) make it sound like this is a particularly thorny issue, I don't believe it actually is - it's usually pretty easy to figure out who key influencers are simply by follower/retweet counts and so on. While there are engagement benefits to getting ""everyday"" consumers' posts recognized, my experience is that brands are already doing this pretty effectively organically.After ""roughly doubling"" ARR in previous years, Olapic's 2016 ARR will grow from $15 million to $25 million - decelerating to 60% growth - and I question whether or not these kinds of growth rates are sustainable. In sharp contrast to what Monotype management is saying, I think many clients may still be in ""test"" mode, judging by the relatively low per-client fees.Indeed, my experience from talking to dozens of digital marketing and/or ad-tech plays is that big brands are quite willing to test out pretty much anything under the sun - but the lack of a barrier to entry means that the next guy who comes along offering a slick pitch can steal your budget away from you. Indeed, once-hot ad-tech names have been a slow-burning train wreck over the past few years:The second is that this is still a more labor-intensive business than a pure SaaS technology platform. Monotype management noted that while the algorithm does 80% of the work, the last 20% involves manual selection. I would note that even giving Olapic credit for 2016 exit run-rate annualized revenue (ARR) of $25 million, their revenue per employee is below $150,000 - well below the ~$200,000 benchmark for a decently-run SaaS company. Now, that may be skewed by Olapic's rapid growth rate, as well as the overseas software development hub (Argentina), but this would look even worse if you used GAAP revenue rather than forward-looking ARR.That feeds into the third and final issue, which is that Monotype management woefully overpaid for this deal. The total consideration - $130 million cash plus $19 million in stock - equates to roughly 6 times forward-looking ARR, or 10x trailing GAAP revenue (if the growth rate in ARR and GAAP revenue are equivalent).Given the more labor-intensive nature of this product relative to most SaaS companies and the rapid evolution and disintermediation of yesterday's exciting digital marketing stories, multiples in the digital marketing space have compressed - they simply don't have the same business quality or industry dynamics as a niche, defensible software company like Five9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) or Exa (NASDAQ:EXA). Long-term margins are not likely to approximate the 20% target of most SaaS companies, and I can't tell you how many times I've seen rapid growth stop on a dime as advertisers move to the next hot thing.There's no shortage of companies playing in between influencers and brands - Izea (NASDAQ:IZEA) in the public markets and dozens upon dozens in the private markets - and it remains whether to be seen whether the land-grab will ever turn out to be profitable. I've heard this story enough times from executives of high-flying peers that are no longer high flying to be very skeptical. Indeed, within Olapic's own market, competitor Candid advertises its ""unbeatable pricing"":Source: Google SearchIn an industry with very low barriers to entry, pricing competition (which clearly already seems to be ongoing) doesn't speak well for future returns.Then there's the fact that this growth isn't free - far from being self-funding, Olapic is expected to consume $10-$15 million in EBITDA next year, suggesting that if it keeps up a 50% growth rate (vs. 66% in 2016), it'll be spending a dollar of EBITDA for every incremental dollar of revenue growth it brings in. That is a very high customer acquisition cost, and I'm concerned it'll end up being money washed down the drain.Meanwhile, The Core Business Isn't Blowing The Lights OutThere's no way around it: Olapic looks like a very bad deal, and shareholders have to live with the possibility that more of their hard-earned free cash flow will be wasted on similar follies. But at the right price, and if the core business is doing well enough, then I'm willing to bear that risk - there are at least two companies I own where I think M&A may be value-destructive, but the companies are cheap enough (with enough other good characteristics) that it's worth taking a position anyway.In the case of Monotype, I do continue to like their core business, although the valuation isn't quite cheap enough (as I discuss in the next section). As I referenced in the introduction, the OEM segment continues to be challenged, as printers declined at a mid single-digit rate in the quarter (consistent with my expectations). The company pointed to an IDC forecast that calls for 1% long-term growth, but I continue to view this as unrealistic and think that the secular decline in printing will offset high-single to double-digit growth in the Creative Professionals segment.Besides that, things continue to go alright on the revenue front: HTML5 generated half a million in revenue for the quarter, which may not sound like much, but I believe management when they say they expect this business to see a rapid ramp like Web Fonts did.The big challenge, unfortunately, continues to be margin expansion - management was unwilling to commit to margin expansion in the core business next year since they ""haven't done budgeting"" yet. While investments in HTML5 and other areas should naturally boost margins a little, I think the operating leverage story that bulls have been looking for (judging by the share price over the past few years) is likely to be muted, even independent of investments in areas like Olapic and Swyft.Valuation: Not Quite There YetWhat's interesting to me is that even after the acquisition-fueled plunge in the share price, the market is still giving Monotype management a lot of credit. As it stands today, this year's EBITDA looks to be in the $60-$65 million range (after treating stock-based comp as a real cash expense, in line with economic reality). Adding the Olapic deal consideration to the current enterprise value (since it hasn't closed yet), at ~$20, the pro forma valuation is still over 13x EBITDA.In defense of Monotype, this is a capital-light business whose core product (fonts) seems pretty intriguing from a growth and competitive landscape point of view. I'm willing to assume it will grow mid-to-high single digits over the long term, even if printer woes continue to challenge the short term. On assumptions, I feel comfortable making, I can support a valuation of around ~12x EBITDA - certainly not a low multiple, but reasonable in context of the business characteristics. That works out to a share price in the $17-$18 range vs. today's price of $20. On its face, then, if you're a growth-oriented investors, Monotype isn't so expensive as to be scary.The challenge, unfortunately, is that EBITDA is almost certainly going to drop in 2017, as it would take teens-to-twenties growth in the core business to offset the incremental investments in Olapic. My view, obviously, is that they might as well light money on fire as invest in Olapic, since the low stickiness/barriers to entry and low long-term margin profile of that business does not seem sufficient to support the high customer acquisition cost.The good news, on the other hand, is that these investments aren't mandatory - if/when it becomes clear that Olapic is a money drain, Monotype will hopefully shut it down or sell it to someone else - and there's obviously a blue-sky scenario where the business actually works out (although my experience with the digital marketing industry suggests the probability of that is rather low).With all that, then, it's hard to see the value case for Monotype, even after another drop on top of years of poor share price performance. It would still not be obviously cheap even if you ignored the money they're going to spend on Olapic, and the two halves of their business - fonts and ""other digital marketing"" - have extremely different competitive profiles and need to be valued very differently. I previously referenced the implosion in ad-tech, and the revenue multiples of once-hot firms are no longer so hot:Any sum-of-the-parts approach (separating Monotype's fonts business from Swyft and Olapic) would thus have to use a pretty uncharitable valuation for the non-fonts side, making it hard for me to see the value case there as well.Final ThoughtsI had really high hopes for Monotype as a prospective investment candidate, as I hoped its position in that middle ground of ""too growthy for value guys"" and ""not growthy enough for growth guys"" would lead the share price to languish to a point where I could take a serious look. On the basis of their nichey, unique fonts business alone, I continue to believe this is a company worth checking in on over the long term.Unfortunately, shares don't look cheap today any way I slice it, and that's without assigning any penalty for poor capital allocation decisions - which given the clean balance sheet, ample liquidity, significant free cash flow, and continued management commentary around building a ""platform,"" may well continue. If there comes a day when the current strategy is abandoned and new management are brought in to run the business with a more sensible approach, I'll be watching - but until then, it would take a deep discount to get me interested, and that's just not present at the current share price.Indeed, I think without a more bullish/optimistic angle on the non-fonts side of the business, shareholders who are in the story looking for solid cash flow and growth should probably look elsewhere. I don't see any redeeming qualities of the Olapic deal, and if future cash flows are similarly frittered away, then fundamental valuation work may not matter - value won't accrete to shareholders.Author's note: Starting later this month, I will be launching a Marketplace subscription service featuring objective coverage of underfollowed small-caps like Monotype from a buysider's perspective.

4057750,102950,2017-03-25T11:26:59-04:00,Dissipating monopoly From competition in free fonts.Overestimation of growth opportunities in automotive industry.Declining printer revenue streams.Revenue exposed to foreign currency risk.,"By Preston Bryant '19, David Xu '20, Cade Zawacki '19Carnegie Mellon University-Tepper School of BusinessInvestment Thesis:Current Share Price (as of 3/10/2017): $19.50Projected Share Price: $16.03Thesis: Monotype Imaging Holdings (NASDAQ:TYPE) is an ideal short candidate due to its weakening monopoly over the font industry; paired with a management team overly optimistic about growth opportunities in the consumer devices segment while also failing to adequately acknowledge the risks of being overly exposed to declining printer sales.Company Overview:Monotype Imaging Holdings Inc., headquartered in Woburn Massachusetts, is a provider of typeface and text display technology for use by creative professionals and technology that is embedded in consumer devices. In the words of the company itself, Monotype ""brings the world's words to the page and to the screen."" With a growing library of over 20,000 typefaces, including widely used classics such as Helvetica and Times New Roman, Monotype aims to facilitate creative expression and to help global brands connect more personally with their consumers through a recognizable voice and a distinct public image; servicing clients across the world and across all sectors: a notable few being AT&T (NYSE:T), CVS Pharmacy, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Nike (NYSE:NKE), Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP), and Target (NYSE:TGT).Business Model:As a marketer may advise, choosing the right typeface and font for a logo or website is often a key factor separating what becomes a successful design from something that is ignored or overlooked. To delve briefly into technical definitions, a ""typeface"" is an agreed design scheme for a set of characters used to compose text (in layman's terms, for example, the shape of the letter A), whereas a ""font"" is a computer file describing to a system how certain characters should be displayed either on a screen or to be printed out onto a page. Via the 1976 Copyright Act, typefaces themselves are not recognized as intellectual property in the United States and, therefore, are not protected under any copyright or patent law. However, fonts are considered to be a piece of software, and are, therefore, protected. This enables Monotype to generate revenue by licensing use of its fonts to content creators. Historically, Monotype found business by designing fonts that were specially optimized for smooth processing and scalability as to maximize readability - particularly on small-screen and low-resolution devices, where other (generally free) font alternatives tended to distort and become hard to read.Monotype sells its fonts to large corporations such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) through long-standing contractual licensing agreements, and also to individual consumers via its many e-commerce websites such as myfonts.com, fonts.com, fontshop.com, linotype.com, and fontfont.com. For many years, Monotype enjoyed essentially operating a monopoly as the only major online font provider. This industry domination, however, has recently become challenged as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) continues to expand its free font offerings and online communities have emerged (such as Behance, recently purchased by Adobe) as platforms for independent designers to easily sell or give away their fonts. This increase in competition has recently begun to materialize with Monotype missing its earnings and revenue expectations by significant margins over the past two quarters: most recently with a -37.8% surprise on February 17, 2017.Industry Overview:Monotype is a part of the software licensing and monetization (SLM) industry. When Monotype licenses its fonts to firms, the firm must also have the technology to support the font in its device. For example, with laser printers, it must be able to recognize the font from the computer and then reproduce it in writing, with both processes requiring software from Monotype to do so. SLM enables software publishers and intelligent device vendors to efficiently monetize their products, particularly, for enterprise and networked deployments. Client-side enforcement can be done using hardware keys or dongles from within the software or through the cloud. Electronic enforcement is growing faster than hardware-based enforcement. Usage-based licensing is the fastest growing application for software monetization solutions.Industrial automation is the fastest-growing application within the embedded segment, with healthcare and automotive also showing promise. Usage-based licensing is a key trend in the software monetization market as customers gain increasing say in how they want to consume and pay for their software. North America and Latin America (NALA) have overtaken Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) as the strongest regional market. Asia-Pacific (APAC) is also growing, driven by growing publisher revenues, cloud-based deployments, and aggressive global expansion by publishers. The SLM market continues to have fewer than 10 key vendors. Revenue in 2015 narrowly exceeded $300 million. The forecasted CAGR from 2015 to 2022 is 6.0%. (Frost and Sullivan). Below is the current breakdown in the software licensing industry in terms of market share:A key item to note is that Adobe Systems, a key competitor for Monotype, has a 5.19% market share in the industry. In addition, comparing across countries, US SLMs are typically more mature than their foreign counterparts. Look below to see a graphic ranking by geographical region the life cycle of SLMs:Catalysts Supporting a Short:1. In the type industry, it has been established that Monotype has historically operated with a monopoly. Major software and technology companies such as Google, Adobe, and Microsoft (Office Suite), along with large-scale print publications such as The Economist and Pearson relied on Monotype for font solutions. Compared to its closest competitor (Adobe), Monotype owns approximately nine times as many fonts and is considered to be more widely used (Economist). As evidence to this, Monotype owns seven of the 10 most popular fonts used on Microsoft Office (Microsoft). Designers throughout the industry, such as Erik Spiekermann, even went so far as to say ""Will Monotype Imaging be renamed Monopoly Imaging?"" since it has been so dominant in the font space. Yet, Monotype's historic dominance in this industry has recently begun to dissipate. The reason for this is that there has been a flood of new entrants in the space who have been offering free font alternatives. The arrival of these free fonts started to appear in 2010, most notably from Google. What has been challenging for Monotype is that many of the fonts Google owns are popular and free, which incentivizes developers and companies to look toward these fonts rather than Monotype's pricey Font Library. The graphic below describes the key differences between Google and Monotype:Even CEO Scott Landers has acknowledged that the dominance within the font space is diminishing. He recently said, ""I think it was always a big section, it's the largest section of that market, which was kind of the free one, right. And then kind of Google always had it and probably always will"". In addition to Google attacking Monotype's monopoly of the industry, Microsoft's default font shift also puts into question Monotype's popularity and font recognition. Microsoft has been proactive in the font space, creating popular fonts such as Calibri and Cambria. These fonts replaced Times New Roman as the default fonts in Microsoft Suite 2007 (Microsoft). This has caused many institutions to move away using Times New Roman (since it is not the default) as well.2. Throughout Monotype's earning calls and other financial filings, there has been a consistent trend of pointing toward entry into the automotive industry (as navigation system and control system font types). For instance, in the Q4 2016 earnings call, current CEO, Scott Landers, pointed out that automotive industry is being looked to for growth in a declining OEM business burdened by their laser printing clients. However, looking at the current state of the automotive industry in addition to Monotype's penetration and added revenue in the industry suggests that this will not be the engine of growth that will carry the struggling OEM business as Monotype management suggests it well. Back in its Q2 2014 earnings call, Scott Landers shed some light on Monotype's goals for this industry - summarized in the following tables:Note: The most important number in this table (2016 Total Car Revenue) was derived by increasing 2013 Profit Per Car by the rate of inflation and using information found in Q4 2016 earnings call and using information provided by OICAThe table points out that Monotype presence in the automotive market is still in its infancy. In the words of CEO Scott Landers: ""our current customers represent approximately 70% of the total unit shipped. We believe that we're now 20% penetrative within our current customers, which leaves us with a meaningful opportunity to expand within existing accounts"" (Q4 2016 earnings call). Landers, back in Q2 2014, stated that Monotype's ultimate goal is to achieve 100% market penetration: an opportunity, he thinks, will create an additional ""$20 million revenue stream"" (Q2 2014 earnings call). According to the profit Monotype received per car in 2014, in order reach this figure, Monotype would have to enter approximately 39,215,686 cars; a 299.15% increase from its 2016 estimates. In short, management thought that automotives had the potential to increase total revenue by about 10% while helping the struggling OEM revenue segment (which accounts for 50% of total revenue) by about 20%. While Monotype does work with Tier 1 automotive companies (ex. Ford (NYSE:F), Porsche (OTCPK:POAHF), GM (NYSE:GM), etc.), the emergence of ride-sharing companies such as Uber (NYSE:UBER) and Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), along with concerns regarding how autonomous cars will affect consumer automotive purchases, creates uncertainty about revenue growth in this segment. These new disruptors are delaying car purchases according to a CNBC poll from 2015: ""The real potential challenge to auto sales came from the survey's second question, which asked whether Uber users would reconsider the purchase of a car specifically because they use Uber. According to the survey, 22 percent of Uber users aged 18 to 64, who have used the service in the past six months, said they were delaying or holding off buying a new car for that very reason"" (CNBC). This, in addition to fears that the auto sales in developed countries such as the United States and the European Union will retreat from six-year highs, constitutes concern as to whether car manufacturers will continue to produce at their current volume (New York Times). This concept is summarized in the table below:Note: Data collected from OICA. On average, Cars Made exceed Sales by 1,741,765 and both were correlated with one another with an R^2 of .99.With the sale of cars being highly correlated to the number of cars produced, paired with the increasing popularity of ride-sharing and stalling car purchases, the demand for automobiles is poised to slow down. As such, management is overly optimistic on automotive revenue for this year and failing to meet expectations will likely have a negative impact on its share price.3. A major component of Monotype's revenue comes from OEM sales - accounting for around 50% of its business. This massive dependency on OEM sales creates a huge risk for Monotype moving forward - especially as revenue from this segment has been declining: in 2015, Monotype's OEM segment saw revenue fall by nearly 3%. Underlying this negative trend is the weakening sales of laser printers that embed Monotype's font technology; making up around 30% of Monotype's total revenue.As evidence of this slowdown, the International Data Corporation (IDC) estimated that global printer sales slumped by almost 11% year over year in 2015. Furthermore, the CEO of Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HP), a company largely dependent on printer sales, commented on HP's declining revenue by stating that the printer market continues ""to be challenging,"" reiterating the company's weak outlook for 2017. Despite this, Monotype's current CEO and president, Scott Landers, has yet to fully acknowledge the risk of being overexposed in this department - instead citing printers as a long-term growth opportunity on the speculation that sales will pick back up.Monotype has tried to combat declining printer sales with optimistic prospects for growth in other segments such as GPS, digital camera, e-readers, wearable tech, and even virtual reality. The increasing usage of smartphones, however, as solutions for these segments represents a major concern for the future potential of Monotype's imaging technology as FreeType, a free open source text render that is very actively managed and updated regularly, almost exclusively handles visual displays on Linux, iOS, Android, and ChromeOS devices. In addition to this, there has been a recent increase in the popularity of voice-commanded devices such as the Amazon Echo (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google Home which, by their design, do not require any text interfaces. As these two trends continue to expand and perhaps even accelerate, Monotype will become less relevant.Over the past two years, Monotype acquired two early-stage, digital marketing companies, Swyft Media and Olapic, for together around $157 million. These purchases were an attempt by management to diversify Monotype's revenue streams away from its traditional font niche and into the branded engagement arena - which, however, is an incredibly competitive industry. Olapic, for example, had negative income before its acquisitions, and has continued to destroy value under Monotype.4. Monotype primarily operates within the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. As such, a large portion of its revenue (43.8%) is exposed to foreign currency risks. The general consensus is that interest rate increases in the United States (several analysts are stating that it is possible for up to four rate hikes this year), paired with the possibility that the Trump administration will adapt isolationist economic policies, will continue to strengthen the value of U.S. Dollar - which, in turn, would diminish the value of Monotype's foreign sales.Company Valuation:To provide a valuation of the company itself, we created a Discounted Cash Flow for Monotype. However, since we are advocating a short position, the following valuation model utilizes growth projections that are optimistic compared against industry averages.Since 2013, Monotype's EBIT growth has been quickly declining, falling from its then growth of 6.52% to the current decline of -36.16%. Before 2013, however, Monotype had seen consistent EBIT growth, reaching a peak of 21.63% growth in 2010. With its new plans to expand into the automotive and virtual reality markets, while simultaneously detracting from the OEM sector, we are giving Monotype the benefit of the doubt and projecting positive growth for the coming years. In its prime years, the average growth rate was approximately 12%, so we assume the optimistic growth rate of 12%.Depreciation & amortization and capital expenditures were left relatively unchanged throughout the years because, historically, aside from minor fluctuations, the two values did not change significantly. Capital expenditures did spike in 2014 and 2015 due to the acquisitions of Swyft Media and Olapic, but these values are outliers. New acquisitions would result in similar capital expenditure spikes and create a lower valuation. We, however, assumed Monotype will not make any new acquisitions in the following years.The projected values for net working capital were based off of an exponential function modeling the historical changes in working capital recorded in Monotype's annual reports. Net working capital tended to fluctuate, but primary characteristic is that the magnitude of its changes has been consistently decreasing, tending closer to 0% change.Finally, if looking at its balance sheet, it can be seen that in the previous years, Monotype did not have any long-term debt. The sudden jump to $105 million in debt, as stated in its annual report, was due to a large loan taken out to pay for the acquisition of Olapic. However, Monotype also has $91 million in cash reserves, so its net debt is $14 million.Using both the perpetuity growth and EBITDA multiple methods, we have come up with the following valuations:The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) was determined to be 12.03%. This was found by taking the weighted average of the cost of holding equity ((CoE)) and the cost of holding debt (CoD). The former is found by using the Capital Asset Pricing Model while the latter is set as the interest rate on Monotype's line of credit. The two result in a CoE weight of 11.49% and a CoD weight of 0.54%, resulting in 12.03%. To encapsulate variation in the WACC, we determined the price ranges from 11.5% to 12.5%.Both the terminal EBITDA multiple and perpetuity growth rate were set higher than the current multiples. In an optimistic sense, the company would continuously outpace its current performance, causing the multiples to rise.However, even with such optimistic measures in the DCF, the share price hovers around approximately $15.50-16.50. This valuation is far below Monotype's current share price, implying that the stock is overvalued.This article is part of Seeking Alpha PRO.

1283141,46021,2013-03-18T12:10:54-04:00,,"Monotype Imaging Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:TYPE) reported FY 2012 revenue growth of 22% and EPS growth of 25%, aided by 64% growth in their Creative Professional segment. This performance beat estimates and caused analysts to ratchet up their estimates for the next quarter and for the year. This begs the questions - what's driving their growth and is it sustainable?Before we examine the growth catalysts, a quick overview of their business is in order.What does Monotype make?It might come at a surprise that you are using their product as you read this article. This article is written in Helvetica font. It's one of the world's most popular fonts and it's owned by Monotype. Monotype is a Font Foundry with 18,000 typeface designs in more than 200 languages. They perform the artistic work of drawing original fonts and they develop the coding required to tell computer graphics cards and printers how to draw them and how to scale them. When you purchased the device you are using to read this article, part of your payment went to Monotype, so you can read text written with their fonts. Yet, that's not the only way they get paid, as I will explain later.Their annual revenue is only $150M and their market cap $814M. However, they have been growing nicely, due to the success of two new growth segments. The chart below shows their annual sales trend going back to 2005. Notice that during the worldwide financial crises, their sales only dipped 15% - not shabby for a small-cap company. In fact, the company stated 85% of their revenue is recurring or predictable.Management TeamThe company's growth story, which I will explain shortly, is compelling. Yet, it is not what impressed me most about this little company. Rather, it is the management team. Since most of the information used to research a company is sourced from the management team via conference calls, 10Qs, 10Ks, etc., it's important to ascertain the quality of the management team before putting too much faith in what they say or publish.When I evaluate the quality of a company's management team, I look for three things - experience, track record, and credibility. This team is very experienced (CEO has 30 years experience in the business) and understands the company and their market well. This is evident when listening to the calls.However, it's their track record that stands out. When they took the company public in 2007, they were primarily a supplier of print drivers to the laser printer market. The management team had a vision for how to grow the business. They effectively used the funds from the IPO and cash flow from the legacy print driver segment to fund two growth segments and they now account for 60% of the total revenue.One simple way to judge the management team's credibility is to determine if they are from the ""under promise and over deliver"" school of management. As shown below, there have not been any negative earnings surprises in the past four quarters.Another way to judge the management team's credibility is to go back a few years, listen to their calls and read the 10Qs and Ks, identify the goals they established, and then determine if they have been able to achieve those goals. Again, their track record shows they have been successful achieving their goals.Nonetheless, I do have some criticisms of this team. They can improve their communication of the business performance. For example, on the calls and investor presentations, they describe the business operating in three segments - Print Imaging, Display Imaging, and Creative Professional. However, in the 10Ks and Qs they report two segments - OEM and Creative Professional. This muddles their message a bit. To understand how the business segments are performing, you have to listen to the call and write down the numbers.Growth DriversLet's return to the opening questions - what's driving the growth in this company and is it sustainable?Monotype operates in three business segments.The Display Imaging business segment is bifurcated into two categories with the revenue split roughly in half. The CE devices revenue comes from providing licensed fonts to manufacturers of eReaders, tablets, mobile phones, and automobiles. The engine of growth in this segment is the shipment growth in tablets, eReaders, and mobile phones, since Monotype receives per unit royalties for devices shipped with their fonts installed. The other portion of Display Imaging is the Independent Software Vendor (ISV) category. The ISV revenue results from licensing fonts to software developers, video game developers, and large software companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).The Creative Professional business segment licenses fonts to end users for electronic and print applications. The engine of growth in this segment is the growth in the number of web sites being developed (571 created every minute, according to the company), mobile advertising spend growth (38%) and the desire for companies to maintain the same look and feel across different web browsers, operating systems, and hardware platforms (PCs, tablets, mobile phones, etc.). The Creative Professional segment receives 60% of its sales from eCommerce web sites.Web Font RevolutionThere is another problem the CP segment solves and revenues from this portion of the Creative Professional segment are expected to double from $5M to $10M in 2013 according to management. What is the problem being solved?When you buy a device, mobile phone, tablet, laptop, etc., the only licensed fonts you can read on that device are the fonts the maker of that device licensed. So if you're viewing a web site which uses a licensed font that is not licensed on your device, your device will switch to a different font which is licensed for that device. Professional web site developers don't want this to happen and so they constrain their font choices to a relatively small set of commonly licensed fonts.This is where ""Web Fonts"" fits in. When a developer purchases ""Web Fonts"" from Monotype or a competitor, they are free to choose any Web Font available and can be rest assured that the reader would see the exact same font regardless of the device they are using. Web Fonts allow the reader's device to display the intended font even if it is not licensed on the reader's device. This liberates the developer to choose fonts that fit their creative vision for the web site. Take a look at the screen shot of the web page below.This web site was developed using Web Fonts. All of the letters and numbers are scalable and searchable text. Try this; go to the web page and use the FIND command to search for some of the text on the page. Prior to Web Font technology, this type of non-standard, creative text would have been implemented as a graphics image - which is not searchable, is more difficult to change, and has to be modified to fit on a smaller mobile screen. Now notice a banner ad on your mobile phone. Most of them are bitmap images - not searchable text. This represents future Monotype business.Growth Inflection PointWeb Fonts are new to the industry. Management indicated that the industry-wide adoption rate of Web Fonts is nearing 15%. Management believes that the 15% adoption rate could be an inflection point leading to a period of rapid growth in the industry-wide adoption of Web Font technology. This is based on the Innovation Adoption Lifecycle curve developed by Everett Rogers in 1962. According to this theory, the innovation moves from Early Adopters phase to the Early Majority phase around 16%. We will see if this actually translates into a steeper growth curve as predicted by the theory.Creative Professional GrowthHow fast is the Creative Professional segment growing by quarter? The chart below shows the Creative Professional segment revenue and growth rate. Organic growth became an issue in Q1 2012 when the revenue from the Bitstream acquisition began to contribute. Management does not specifically break out organic revenue. However, they did state that the Bitstream acquisition will add between $13-$14M per year. Based on that, I plotted the estimated organic revenue growth below.The year-over-year growth rates are phenomenal, both the organic and total.The chart above suggests the Creative Professional segment QoQ growth is slowing. Nonetheless, a modest 5% QoQ growth rate amounts to a 22% YoY growth rate.Creative Professional Long-Term Growth PotentialManagement estimates the addressable market is $250M. Given the current CP revenue of $52M, there is significant growth potential.Threat from AdobeIs Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) a threat to Monotype's business? Adobe was the pioneer in the development of scalable font technology and so it seems natural they would be a threat to Monotype. As strange as this sounds, Adobe is actually Monotype's largest client. In addition, Adobe recently announced that their ""Adobe Creative Cloud"" service now offers Monotype fonts.Threat from GoogleHow does Google's Web Font business compete with Monotype? This question came up on a conference call. Management answered by saying that typically, a web site developer will search for the free Google fonts first, and then will turn to Monotype or other licensed font foundries to get the fonts they can't get from Google. This is because Google has a relatively small library of fonts available, hundreds versus Monotype's 20,000 in 40 languages.Open Source ThreatsWhy do the developers need licensed fonts when free, open sourced and knock-off fonts are available? Try this. Magnify the text of this article as large as you can. Did the letters maintain their intended look or did they begin to pixelate? If they maintained their look it is because the code behind the font was properly written and will allow the font to scale properly. Some free fonts won't scale properly, will look different on different devices or web browsers, resulting in slow page turn, or may even lock up your device.If you are a professional web site developer, you spend hours trying to get the site to look exactly like you want. You don't want that look to be dependent on the browser, operating system, or device the user is using. Paying for licensed fonts that you trust is worth it.Display Imaging GrowthThe Display Imaging segment is benefiting from the growth in tablets, and mobile phones. In addition, they have recently signed nine automotive contracts for customers including GM (NYSE:GM), Ford (NYSE:F), Chrysler and Audi. They have contracts with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Barnes and Noble (NYSE:BKS) for the eReaders and they are in BlackBerry's (BBRY) new BlackBerry 10 OS. This segment grew at the rate of 20% in 2012 but management expects growth to slow some due to slowing of growth in the Independent Software Vendor portion of the Display Imaging segment, which represents half of the segment revenue.Management estimates the addressable market is $500M. This leaves plenty of room for growth given the current DI segment revenue of $37M.ValuationLet's start by analyzing the analysts' estimates and determine if they look reasonable.The table above was constructed using management's expectation that the Print Imaging segment will see 0-5% growth, and that Creative Professional will represent 40% of the total revenue at the end of 2013. I then allocated segment revenue to fit the average analyst's estimates for the total revenue.Now the question is whether or not the derived segment growth rates for Display Imaging and Creative Professional look reasonable. In order to achieve the 30% growth rate in Creative Professional, it needs to exhibit 7% QoQ growth rate for all four quarters. The average CP organic QoQ growth rate for 2012 was 9%. So I think it is reasonable CP could grow 7% QoQ in 2013.That just leaves Display Imaging. The derived growth rate of 10% is half the 2012 growth rate. Is this 10% growth a reasonable estimate? Let's check it against statements made by management.Management believes the CE Device revenue will grow at 20% as it did in 2012. However, they are concerned that the ISV portion of Display Imaging will experience a cyclical slowdown. If you assume zero growth in the ISV portion and 20% growth in the CE Devices portion, it averages to 10% overall. Therefore, the estimate looks reasonable.The average analyst estimate for 2013 EPS is $1.17. Given a growth P/E multiple of 20, a reasonable price per share is $23.40.With the current share price trading around $22, there is not much obvious quick money to be made at this level. However, there are many reasons this stock could be a good long term buy and hold.1. Quality of the management team.2. Success of the two new growth segments.3. Possibility for faster-than-expected growth in the Creative Professional segment due to Web Fonts.4. The large sizes of the Creative Professional and Display Imaging addressable markets allow for large growth potential.Disclosure: I am long TYPE. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1273511,24361,2013-03-15T10:40:00-04:00,,"Fonts and typefaces fall into that group of technologies that nobody thinks about unless/until they fail or don't look right. Monotype Imaging (NASDAQ:TYPE) makes sure that doesn't happen often, as it is a leading developer of text imaging software and solutions. Although the shares look reasonably valued today, more success in emerging end-market opportunities could lead to better-than-expected performance down the line.Legibility Is UnderratedOEMs use Monotype's technology in consumer products like printers, mobile handsets, and automobiles. These fonts are embedded in products like laser printers or phones and allow the devices to present clear, easy-to-read text in a variety of fonts. Monotype owns or licenses more than 13,000 typefaces, and as these are trademarked (not patented), Monotype effectively has a moat around them indefinitely.It's not just Monotype's library of typefaces that makes it an interesting OEM partner. The company's scaling technology produces real storage savings in comparison to storage-intensive bitmaps, and that's a key advantage for OEMs. It's also worth noting that scaling isn't as simple as it might sound - scaling Roman letters isn't that complicated, but compressing non-Western scripts like Chinese or Sanskrit without losing legibility is another matter.Moving From Printers To New DevicesSix years ago, Monotype generated about 70% of its revenue from printer OEMs like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Lexmark (NYSE:LXK), and Canon (NYSE:CAJ). In the intervening years, there have been some hard times for the major printer manufacturers. Even so, I think investors may not realize that overall printer shipments haven't evaporated - a number of other printer manufacturers (most of them located in Asia) have increased their unit share, and given that Monotype's royalties are unit-based, that's kept the business in relatively good shape.All told, the printer market is probably worth about $200 million or so today, with Monotype holding about 30% share. While there are ongoing opportunities from products like page description language (PDL) and print drivers, there will be competition from companies like Software Imaging and regional specialists (companies focused on fonts/typefaces for particular languages or language groups). Though some analysts believe this could still be a high single-digit growth market (and Monotype hasn't historically seen much price pressure), I'm more inclined to assume a lower growth outlook in the low-to-mid single digits.On the other hand, I think Monotype could see significant growth in its display imaging business - a business producing around one-quarter of the company's revenue today. Here the company looks to license its font technology to the makers of mobile handsets, tablets, e-readers, and so on. In addition, the company is increasingly looking to markets like automobiles and TVs as future growth drivers.How much could this be worth? I had a difficult time tracking down a solid global printer unit sales number, but it seems like the number is in the 30 million to 40 million range. By comparison, there could be 200 million e-readers and tablets in play by 2015 and over 2 billion handsets. Users need clear and legible fonts on these devices just as much as on printed pages, and this could be a market worth $500 million or more to Monotype.Playing The Switch To Digital MediaMonotype also has something to gain from the transition of print media to web-based content. Redesigning media for the web requires fonts and scaling technologies too, particularly as designers need to move away from options like using gifs or jpegs for reasons of search engine optimization.Monotype certainly has relevant experience and technology here, but this could be a more competitive market space over the years. Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) are both partners and competitors for the company, and other players like Extensis and Insider Software are looking at many of the same market opportunities. Even so, this is a market that could be worth more than $200 million in revenue, and it seems to be growing at a very good clip (revenue was up nearly 90% in the fourth quarter of 2012).Reasonable Growth Prospects And Solid MarginsAll told, Monotype could be serving markets with $1 billion in revenue potential - a sizable number relative to its 2012 annual revenue number of $150 million. While I think the printer market is likely to be a lower-growth market, the prospects in display and the ""creative professional"" market are brighter and these markets could easily post high single-digit growth over the next five to 10 years.I am looking for Monotype to grow sales at a long-term rate of about 8%. Much of this is predicated on the company gaining share in display markets like e-readers, tablets, phones, and cars similar to what it has achieved in printers. Clearly, then, there are competitive risks to the revenue number if OEMs find better scaling/compression solutions.One of the attractive parts of this story is that the company has an inherently high-margin/high-cash flow business, as it is essentially a licensing/royalty business. While the company does reinvest a fair percentage of profits back into R&D, the operating and free cash flow margins are quite strong. That sort of rich profitability does carry some risk though - namely, it makes it an attractive market to try to enter, though the company's trademark IP creates at least a partial moat.I don't really see how the company leverages its expenses significantly beyond what it has already done, though, and that leads me to a long-term free cash flow growth assumption very similar to the revenue growth. That, then, is another risk factor - this story is very much tied to success in signing up licensing partners and seeing them succeed in terms of unit volume, as the company doesn't have a lot of ways to improve margins/profits otherwise.The Bottom LineIf Monotype can generate long-term free cash flow growth of around 8%, these shares appear to be worth around $25 today. Should the company manage a higher revenue growth rate, though, the fair value jumps as well - to about $28 at 10% revenue growth and $34 at 13% revenue growth (the company's 10-year trailing compound revenue growth rate).All in all, this looks like an interesting stock today. There's not all that much sell-side coverage and the valuation is reasonable, and it seems like the company is well-positioned to leverage ongoing unit growth from a variety of consumer goods and a growing market for digital media.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1681312,24361,2013-09-09T10:58:19-04:00,,"Given that Monotype Imaging (NASDAQ:TYPE) is up about 16% since I recommended it in mid-March (against 6% for the S&P 500), I'm feeling pretty good about that call. Likewise, I still like the long-term opportunity for this company. Fonts and typefaces are one of those businesses that fits in with Peter Lynch's philosophy of targeting overlooked businesses that provide essential products/services that nobody thinks about much, if ever.All told, I still believe that Monotype has less than 20% of its potential market, and the revenue opportunity for the company could be as high as $1 billion. On the other hand, demand for consumer and business electronics like handsets, tablets, and printers has been softer lately and the company has had to reduce guidance on the basis of higher/worse-than-expected FX headwinds and taxes. I don't believe that investors need to freak out over the lower guidance for 2013, but it does suggest that these shares may be just marking time until revenue growth reaccelerates.Sluggish Results In The Now …Going back about a month and a half, Montoype surprised the Street with a worse-than-expected second quarter. Revenue growth was only 7%, a sharp deceleration from the prior 20%+ growth rates of prior quarters. That wasn't much of a surprise, though, as reported revenue was only a half million dollars below the Street average (and half of that was from FX). Even so, OEM revenue growth of 6% and Creative growth of just 8% aren't what growth investors want to see.Likewise, the company came in fine with its gross margin (GAAP gross margin up more than a point), operating income (up 3%), and EBITDA relative to expectations. Below the line, though, a higher tax rate took about a penny out of earnings.The worse news was in the guidance. Monotype management took down the top end of revenue guidance and pushed EPS expectations lower on the higher tax rate. Part of the problem with revenue growth in the second half is a set of tough comps in the Independent Software Vendor (ISV) business, but this does not appear to be impacting the long-term outlook.… But Ongoing Deals And New Growth OpportunitiesIf recent results were more ""meh"" than investors were hoping for, at least they can still point to solid deal flow in the company's business. Monotype and Toshiba inked a deal for TYPE's page description language (PDL) for multiple lines of Toshiba's multifunction printers.Although PDL isn't something that people outside of the printing business think much about, it basically allows for page elements to be defined independent of a particular printer's technology - meaning that different printers will consistently print the same page in the same way. Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) Printer Control Language (NYSE:PCL) and Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) PostScript have meaningful share in the market, with Adobe claiming almost 70% share for PostScript and 20% share for PCL. With many Monotype printer OEM customers still using their own languages or licensing these other options, this could be another share/revenue growth opportunity for the company in the coming years.Monotype is also selling Chinese fonts to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for the latter's Kindle Fire and Paperwhite efforts in China. Last and not least, the company has a solid emerging business with Ford (NYSE: F) for various in-vehicle information systems.Slow OEM, Lumpy New Growth OpportunitiesI don't think it's a very controversial statement that the company's core printer market is a relatively slow-growth market. Although HP saw unit growth of 5% in its fiscal third quarter (compared to the 6% revenue growth in TYPE's OEM business), TYPE's growth is going to have to come from effectively competing with native/proprietary software and others like Adobe and HP. On balance, that's a battle that I believe the company can win, but it's unlikely to lead to impressive-looking revenue growth.On the other hand, digital displays, like those that are used with tablets, handsets, TVs, and in-car infotainment systems, should offer double-digit growth for years to come. Even if the high-end smartphone market is slowing, for instance, the mid-range and low-end phones still need legible fonts and imaging.The Creative market is also a significant growth opportunity, but also one where Monotype will have to contend with serious competition from the likes of Adobe. Although Adobe is focusing on a more comprehensive digital marketing/marketing cloud opportunity (including analytics, experience management, and media optimization), they're not going to just let Montotype have the opportunities in web fonts and scaling technologies, particularly as web fonts are increasingly important to search engine optimization. To that end, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and HP could likewise offer some competition and pressure in a market growing more than 10% a year and less than one-quarter penetrated today.Still A Solid Grower Over The Long-TermAlthough Monotype's revenue growth may appear somewhat blunted for the remainder of 2013, the long-term opportunity is still attractive. More to the point, I believe the company still has the opportunity to post a few years of double-digit growth and long-term growth of over 8%. Coupled with a rich free cash flow margin, that points to a lucrative future stream of cash flow.On the other hand, the stock is up almost 70% over the past year (even after a nearly 10% decline from the 52-week high), and the business isn't improving nearly that fast.The Bottom LineRight now, the growth potential of Monotype seems fairly represented in the stock price. I don't think long-term investors need to worry about selling the shares (it's not undervalued, but neither is it dangerously overvalued) today, but I'd be careful about making a large new purchase at these prices. I wouldn't be surprised if these shares chop more or less sideways, particularly until revenue shows reacceleration back above the 10% yoy level. With that, I'm still basically a long-term bull on Monotype, but there are plenty of cheaper stocks to consider today.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1702482,38201,2013-09-19T08:47:58-04:00,,"Monotype Imaging (TYPE) has a collection of approximately 150,000 font products that include its own as well as third party owned fonts. Additionally, the company provides printer drivers, page description language, interpreters, and color imaging solutions to OEMs.Monotype Imaging registered a growth of over 75% in the last twelve months. We are bullish on the stock from a long-term perspective because of its strong fundamentals. Monotype Imaging has two segments - OEM and creative professional. The creative professional segment is the fundamental driver of the company's future growth. It has registered a robust revenue growth of 50.75% in the last twelve months due to the large number of fonts it offers and the number of languages it supports.Bullish on Creative ProfessionalThe growth in the creative professional segment remains the most compelling growth driver for Monotype Imaging. This segment registered a robust revenue growth of 64% year over year in 2012. The growth story continued in the first half of 2013, and the segment has delivered revenue of $29.99 million in the first half of 2013, a year over year growth of 29%.The creative professional segment of Monotype Imaging has a catalog of approximately 30,000 fonts, which support more than 40 Latin and non-Latin languages. These fonts are licensed to end users for electronic and print applications. About 67% of the business in this segment is generated by e-commerce websites. The growth drivers for this segment are increasing website development, growth in advertising spending, and the desire of corporates to make their websites look great.Web font business growthThe answer to the reason for continuous growth in the creative professional segment is the utility of web fonts that Monotype Imaging offers. When a consumer buys an electronic device, say, a mobile, laptop, smartphone, or a desktop, the only fonts that the user sees on that device are those that the device manufacturer has licensed. So, if he is looking at content from a source that uses a licensed font that his device manufacturer hasn't licensed, his device will switch to a different font licensed by the manufacturer. The content provider does not want this to happen, so he limits his font choices to the most commonly licensed fonts in order to maintain the original fonts across various platforms.Through its web fonts, Monotype Imaging provides a solution to this problem. A content provider or web developer, who uses web fonts from Monotype Imaging is free to choose any web font available. Regardless of whether the web font is licensed on the reader's device, he gets to see the original font. This flexibility in using fonts of choice allows the developer to choose fonts according to his choice and creative instincts.Another reason we are bullish on Monotype Imaging's creative professional segment, is the global web font market. The global web font penetration is only around 13%-15%.(Click to enlarge)Source: WikipediaAdoption Lifecycle (shown above), the web fonts market is still in the Early Adopters stage. As the global penetration reaches 16%, this market will move from the early adopters to early majority stage. This is the stage where the market accelerates according to the innovation adoption theory, and the web font market is very close to reaching the 16% mark. This bodes well for Monotype Imaging's web font business, and it expects web font revenue to double from $5 million in 2012 to $10 million in 2013.Adobe's Web font businessTechnology heavyweight, Adobe Systems (ADBE) also has web fonts of its own. Typekit was a pioneer in web font technology when it launched it in 2009. However, Adobe acquired Typekit in 2011. This acquisition allowed Adobe to have its own Typekit Web Fonts library consisting of 1200 web fonts. This Typekit library has become a vital part of Adobe Creative Cloud. With this acquisition, Adobe could have been a threat for Monotype Imaging. Strangely, Adobe is Monotype Imaging's largest client. Adobe entered a partnership last year with Monotype Imaging that adds over 1,000 Monotype Imaging fonts to Adobe's typekit service. Hence, Adobe Creative Cloud now also offers Monotype Imaging fonts.Revenue growthMonotype Imaging has a number of global brands that are customers including Tommy Hilfiger, Ray-Ban, Clorox, Blue Man Group, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), Nike (NYSE:NKE), and Hilton among others. The recent customers in its portfolio include Disney (NYSE:DIS), DreamWorks (NASDAQ:DWA), Maserati, Mongoose, IOP, and a few others. Monotype Imaging reported revenue of $51.75 million in the creative professional segment in 2012. Looking at the opportunities that exist for the company going forward, we believe that it remains on track to achieve its revenue guidance of $60 million in 2013 from the creative professional segment, having already delivered half of that in the first half of 2013.What does the future hold?Monotype Imaging has also made efforts to protect its legacy. The company has trademarks to protect itself from competitors infringing on its patents. Since these trademarks are perpetual, any company that wants to license a font, say Helvetica, must turn to Monotype Imaging today and in the future. Hence, Monotype Imaging has several barriers to entry for competitors to protect its fonts business.The future of the creative professional segment is in mobile advertising, where Monotype Imaging is still in an infant stage. The growth driver for this business segment will be the business potential from existing web clients like Starbucks, Nike and Hilton. These companies are already incorporating Monotype Imaging's web services offering on their corporate websites. So, they are likely to use these services in their mobile apps too in the future. In the second quarter of 2013, Monotype Imaging expanded its licensing options to include mobile apps and e-books. This will allow Monotype Imaging to reach new customers such as game developers and e-book publishers.OEM segmentOEM is another segment where Monotype Imaging reports its revenue. This segment achieved a year over year revenue growth of 6% in the second quarter of 2013, growing from $24.95 million to $26.43 million. The print imaging portion of this business segment is a slow-growing business, having achieved the maturity stage, growing by 3%-5% annually. The management also indicated as much in its latest conference call. 85% of Monotype Imaging's revenue is highly recurring and predictable, and the majority of this recurring revenue comes from the OEM segment.The OEM segment has performed according to the company's expectations in the second quarter of 2013. Amazon.com (AMZN) registered a 22% year over year growth in sales in the second quarter of 2013, due to increasing sales of its kindle and kindle fire HD devices. Amazon began shipping its kindle fire HD tablet to China recently. This product includes Gothic and Song style Chinese fonts from Monotype Imaging. Amazon has thus customized its product according to the needs of its Chinese customers. This has also helped Monotype Imaging to extend its leadership position in the Chinese markets. Amazon has adopted a strategy to expand into the Chinese markets through its kindle sales, and increasing sales will also drive the demand for Monotype Imaging's fonts.Adobe Postcript and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) Printer Command Language, or PCL, are the leading industry standards for printing. Monotype Imaging has a Universal Font Scaling Technology that makes OEMs printer devices compatible with the leading industry printing standards. Additionally, this technology also allows compatibility with PDF, XHTML, and XPS printing languages. Monotype Imaging also supports standard page description language, or PDL. This technological offering is the differentiating factor, allowing OEMs to license different combinations of PDLs and supported file formats such as PostScript 3, PDF, XPS, and PCL 5 and PCL 6. Having this kind of technology allowed Monotype Imaging to strike a deal with Toshiba TEC in the OEM segment in the previous quarter. Toshiba's e-studio multi-function printers now integrate Monotype Imaging font and technologies. It released these printers in China, Europe, and the Americas, and they include Monotype Imaging's fonts, printer drivers, and PCL 6 PDL.Monotype Imaging tapped Toshiba TEC while it was working with a system integrator called Teco in Taiwan. Teco offers turnkey solutions to different printer OEMs. Teco is attempting to gain printer accounts in that region. Hence, Monotype Imaging's PDL business in this emerging market will grow as Teco's printer business grows. With Monotype's technological offering in PDL, printer OEMs are likely to award Teco more contracts because of its collaboration with Monotype Imaging.This month, Monotype Imaging launched the Monotype Baseline Platform, or MBP, which is a cloud-based developer platform that offers access to approximately 30,000 fonts in 40 different languages. This is first-of-its-kind product that is designed to help OEMs, independent software vendors, and developer's program devices and applications to use fonts on a need-based, real time basis. The vendors and OEMs will thus be able to preserve text fidelity in the applications that they design. Enfocus, which provides tools that control the quality of PDF files for print, is the first partner for Monotype to implement the MBP. Missing or corrupted fonts is a perennial problem when printing PDF documents and Enfocus will be able to source these fonts from the cloud using the MBP. As a novel product, MBP is expected to gain traction in the future, particularly as it adds more fonts to the platform over time.Caveats:However, we will throw in a word of caution here. A look at the insider transactions tells that over the last three months, insiders have heavily sold this stock.This is usually an indication that the insiders are not expecting any further increase in the stock price and are booking profits.ConclusionAs already discussed, the long term fundamentals of Monotype Imaging look promising. However, the future growth potential of the company is fairly represented in the stock price, which is trading at around $27 currently.(Click to enlarge)Considering the current P/E multiple of 23.9 and a forward P/E multiple of 21.43, we apply a P/E estimate of 23 to the target price for 2013. At the midpoint of the EPS guidance of $1.09 for the year 2013, we get a target price of $25.07. Since, the stock is already trading above this level; we do not foresee any significant upside in the stock from the present level.Moreover, it will be prudent to look at the EPS history, and the revenue growth patterns in the Creative Professional and OEM segment over the last twelve months. This will give further insight to the investors regarding this stock.(Click to enlarge)Source: Yahoo! FinanceLooking at the EPS history of Monotype Imaging over the last four quarters, it is clear that the actual EPS beat the estimate in the first two quarters, whereas it has missed the estimate in the latest quarter.Revenue Growth in OEM and Creative Professional:Source: Company FilingsComparing the EPS Chart with the revenue growth patterns, it is clear that the creative professional segment has driven the EPS for Monotype Imaging Holdings (although not in the same quantum). A dip in revenue growth in the creative professional segment caused an earnings miss in the second quarter of 2013. We are bullish on the global web fonts market. Once it reaches the growth acceleration point, it should drive growth in the creative professional segment, particularly on the strength of its web fonts business. So, investors need to keep digging into the company's filings with this perspective in mind when considering investing in it.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

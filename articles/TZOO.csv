American and European business.","This article was highlighted for PRO subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Travelzoo (TZOO) is an internet marketing firm focused on the travel industry. However, they came about in a consumer focused way, which I think makes their business more durable. I also think they are a potential beneficiary of the way the travel ecosystem will operate in a post-coronavirus world, and they made a recent acquisition which I think should be quite accretive over time.Travelzoo is consumer and leisure travel focused. The company had its genesis in a regular email newsletter sent out with a list of great value travel deals. That has become the Travelzoo Top 20, with 33 million subscribers. They also run a website, app, and provide travel deal content for a variety of other websites. Finally, they have a ""breaking deal"" type service, where a single travel deal is sent out to subscribers.The company charges for placement in all of its various channels. Advertisers pay mostly based on sales of travel through the linked offers. That makes their revenue stream a commission operation. As travel has declined dramatically, I would expect their current earnings to decline precipitously, at least in the short term.The company has a strong balance sheet, with no debt (other than a promissory note for an acquisition which I'll cover later) and even that is covered by their cash balance at the end of the year. They have indicated they intend to try and re-finance this balance. This makes sense to conserve cash, although I'd expect the interest rate to be potentially high given the state of their markets.The company has significant sales and marketing expenses (roughly 2/3rds of total expenses). I believe a material portion of that is online advertising. That could certainly be reduced during this period to conserve cash if necessary. I think its reasonable to expect that the company will be able to make it through this period given their lack of debt. Management has also regularly noted that their European and North American businesses are consistently profitable, and that they were investing (aka losing money) in Asia trying to build a business there. That effort has been ended, with the company announcing the close of its Asia-Pacific operations. Asia-Pacific revenue declined in 2019 even prior to the coronavirus, and the segment made significant losses, so I think the decision to pull the plug is logical.The key performance metrics in Asia are also much worse than they are in Europe and North America. Specifically, cost to acquire a new member is higher than annual revenue per member, while the opposite is true in existing markets. That means that growth in their mature markets is more profitable than growth in Asia.I believe travel will resume after the COVID-19 crisis has abated, and I think the company's target market (deal focused leisure travelers) will be one of the first segments to come back. This will take time but the percentage of the total travel market addressable by them should expand. That is because while their current market is mostly a group I would call deal focused, most people will probably be looking for deals for their initial travels. That should expand consumer interest in Travelzoo's offerings.On the other side of the coin, travel suppliers (tours, hotels, cruise lines, etc) will be motivated by their fixed capacity and high fixed costs for perishable goods to increase occupancy even at lower prices. But they won't want to disrupt the pricing of their existing channels more than necessary, so offering deals through third party deal aggregators (that don't show up on online travel agent searches) seems likely to become even more popular. That allows suppliers to offer better pricing to price sensitive customers while keeping prices somewhat higher for loyal or those who have a specific reason to use the provider/property in question. That makes it a form of price discrimination, and travel providers are likely to be more aggressive with that in the near term as they deal with significant vacancy.That has two benefits for Travelzoo. The first is that they have a limited amount of inventory slots (The Travelzoo top 20 has room for 20 listings) and if there is more demand for those slots there is the potential for them to charge higher prices for them. It is also likely that the quality of the deal required to get one of those slots goes up. As an example, maybe in 2019 a supplier needed to offer 10% off to get into the newsletter, but in 2020 they might need to offer 20% off.Better deals in the newsletter has multiple benefits for Travelzoo. The biggest is a flywheel effect - if the deals in the newsletter are better, that will improve customer satisfaction with the newsletter. That will result in less canceled subscriptions, more forwards to friends, and generally higher interaction with the newsletter. It is also likely to result in more bookings, and thus more commissions. If bookings increase, the value of the newsletter to suppliers goes up, and so does the price Travelzoo can charge for placements.So all in all, while I think the amount of leisure travel is almost certain to go down post-coronavirus, at least for awhile, I think the amount of money Travelzoo can take out of the system should go down by a much smaller amount.The deal-focused nature of consumers going forward is already in evidence. During the shutdown, Travelzoo has started selling flexible booking vouchers for travel providers. They recently issued a press release detailing over 10,000 room nights booked at various locations over the last two weeks. The willingness of travel providers to pay Travelzoo fees for flexible and voucher based bookings is one example of the leverage they'll have going forward, and the willingness of consumers to book now for a deal is also a good sign. I think that demonstrates that deal focused consumers will be the first to come back. Viad (VVI) operates travel attractions in North America and Iceland, and on their conference call they noted they are expecting that ""given what we're seeing now, it's minimal revenue in the second quarter given the impacts of COVID-19."" That is a much slower ramp up than Travelzoo seems to be having, suggesting that deal focused consumers may be the first market segment back. The company had poor timing for a recent acquisition, but they paid a relatively low price for it, which I think is at least partially offsetting. In January, TZOO agreed to buy Jack's Flight Club, a newsletter provider for deals on flights. This business had the same initial premise as the Travelzoo newsletter - an email list of great travel deals, but focused on flights instead of hotels/tours.But it has evolved in a different way. Because airlines are so consolidated, they pay little to nothing in travel agency commission, and don't pay for deal notification services. That makes the Travelzoo advertising model impossible, and so Jack's uses a subscription model instead. They charge a few dollars per month for access to their premium subscription model, which has more deals and can be customized.Selling subscriptions probably makes them a better business than Travelzoo, and their margins and return on equity are much better. They filed Jack's 2019 financials which is obviously quite helpful. There was $2.45 MM of EBIT in 2019, and $2.07 MM of net income. The difference was entirely due to tax.The purchase price for a 60% interest was $12 MM, which implies a 9.7X P/E. Jack's had $2.5 MM in cash and $1.6 MM in deferred revenue (subscriptions where they collected up front but haven't delivered the entire subscription yet) so even calling the deferred revenue debt that is EV/EBIT of 7.8X.Travelzoo has consistently traded at a higher multiple than that, and Jack's is almost certainly a higher quality business. It also seems likely that Travelzoo will be able to add international growth to Jack's by promoting it through their existing channels, especially in North America. The existing Jack's customer base is very focused on the United Kingdom, and if Travelzoo can gain traction using Jack's in-house software for flight searches to create a comparable business in North America their would be the potential for significant very profitable growth.Q4 2019 Corporate PresentationThis strategy seems very likely to work. The people who are hotel and tour deal shoppers (and thus Travelzoo subscribers) seem very likely to be interested in air travel deals as well. The same corporate presentation notes that Jack's had 15% growth in premium (paid) subscriptions in the first 7 weeks of 2020 after initially promoting the service to the Travelzoo membership in the UK. They also added 100,000 subscriptions to the free version of Jack's which is a huge new add to the top of their funnel, as free members are almost certainly the best source of future growth in paid members.All in, I like the acquisition. The price was low given the quality of the business, probably due to its relatively small size. There is significant scope for growth, and Travelzoo is well placed to provide a catalyst for that growth. Jack's is a better business than the pre-existing Travelzoo operations, so the quality of the overall operation has improved by adding it.Travelzoo has pretty consistently traded at a high multiple of earnings. In the recent past that has been over 50X, but consistently around 30X earnings. It's a new economy, social media type business, which has been en vogue. It is also asset light with very high returns on equity. The business is high quality, and their existing subscriber base is an asset with significant recurring value. With the addition of a quality and fast growing subscription business, I don't think 12X earnings would be an unreasonable multiple to pay for such an operation.The question of forecasting the earnings is quite a different one. It is completely unreasonable to think that 2020 earnings will be anything like 2019, given the sea change in proclivity to travel the world has experienced. Therefore, some assumptions will be necessary. The first one I'll make is that Travelzoo's business will return to something close to its previous level of productivity by 2021. I doubt very much that worldwide travel will have been restored to previous levels by then, but I think the ""deals"" nature of their business will allow them to monetize more effectively in a down market, so I expect their share of total travel spend to increase, and that some of the cost cuts I expect will stick. I will assume their Asian business is wound down by then, and I will apply a 20% haircut to their ex-Asia results from 2019.Further, I assume that they will lose 60% of revenue and gross margins in 2020 from their ex-Asia business, and will cut spending there by 30%.Applying those factors to their 2019 income statement suggests an operating loss of approximately $20 MM. Taking into account the $19.5 MM in cash on their balance sheet at year end, subtracting a $20 MM operating loss, the $12 MM payment for Jack's and assuming they unwind $6 MM of negative working capital would give them a negative $18.5 MM cash balance. I assume there will be some finance charges associated with borrowing that money, so round it up to a $25 MM charge against my valuation.Adding the 2019 EBIT of Jack's and my 2021 forecast for legacy Travelzoo gets a figure of $15.5 MM. Assuming a 25% tax rate that produces earnings of $11.6 MM. At a 12X multiple that suggests a value of $139 MM, less the $30 MM, for a valuation of $109 MM.The company will need to pay for the remainder of Jack's, which will cost $6 MM at the minimum amount. That seems likely given the calculation is based on 2020 results. Deducting that suggests a value of $103 MM.At $189 MM, that implies a value per share of $8.99, or fully double their current price of $4.48.This will trade with the market's opinion on coronavirus concerns until the pandemic is over, and is a bit of a ""risk-on"" name. The biggest (and most obvious) risk is that the pandemic will last longer than I've accounted for. Still, there are a number of sources of conservatism here. I haven't accounted for any of the considerable synergies between Jack's and Travelzoo, and the Jack's subscriber base was up 15% because of those synergies less than two months after the acquisition. While I doubt that growth rate will continue, it does speak to the potential. I also think its possible they will cut more than 30% of their costs this year.Probably the risk I'm most concerned about is that they end up issuing equity or convertible debt at the lows, and diluting away the upside. I assumed the cash they'll need to get through this would be expensive, adding to its value to account for short term financing costs. I would prefer they access straight debt even if it is expensive, and I think the recurring subscription revenue from Jack's should help with that.I also think it's possible they will have some working capital benefits from their new focus on voucher sales. I doubt they pay 100% of the hotel's share to them immediately, I think it's very likely there is a holdback to ensure the hotel delivers the service and to cover refunds to those who choose to cancel their voucher. Thus, Travelzoo will be able to keep cash on their balance sheet for potentially quite awhile (some vouchers are for 2021 redemption). That should help them bridge the gap. There is huge upside here to a reasonable base case, and if travel bounces back more than I've expected or they are able to generate meaningful synergies with Jack's the upside could be even greater. I think their clean balance sheet and obvious non-tangible assets (their customer lists) should help them get through the crisis. Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4314107,21228,2019-12-26T01:33:28-05:00,Travelzoo's stock price has bottomed out and the company is heading into its seasonally strongest quarters.The company recently implemented its Asia Pacific 2020 strategy which should be a positive catalyst in upcoming quarters.The deal-pairing technology showing hotel and flight information now appears to be rolled out in North America. This should be a positive catalyst as well.,"I have written about Travelzoo (TZOO) a couple of times in the past year. I recommended Travelzoo as a buy in January and as a sell in May. Both recommendations resulted in large gains. I think now is a good time to re-enter a long position. The stock price has bottomed out after the company reported its seasonally weakest quarter in Q3 and is now starting to trend back up. The stock price may take another dip if there is tax-loss selling before the end of the year but it appears that window may have already passed.There is a huge potential catalyst that has recently been implemented that could drive gains in the upcoming year. Also, the deal-pairing technology implemented in Europe in the last part of 2018 now appears to be rolled out in North America. Both of these developments should help the company grow revenue and improve profitability in the future.The biggest potential catalyst in the upcoming year is the execution of the company’s “Asia Pacific 2020” plan. For years Travelzoo’s Asia Pacific division has not only had stagnant growth but has also been losing money. To turn things around the CEO mentioned in the Q3 2018 earnings release the goal “to achieve profitability in Asia Pacific by 2020.” In the past year, the company has taken steps to implement this goal.In March of 2019, Travelzoo appointed Scott Wang as the Head of Strategy in Asia Pacific and the General Manager in Greater China. This management transition resulted in a temporarily smaller sales team and also coincided with the escalating trade war with China. Consequently, results in Asia Pacific in the last 3 quarters have actually gotten worse with operating losses exceeding revenues.However, there have been several recent positive developments. In August, Travelzoo formed a partnership with UnionPay International to create a direct-payment experience for Travelzoo members in China. This allowed the company to simplify the payment process for its members in China by removing all third party payment platforms. The company said, “during the test period traffic to Travelzoo's site increased by more than 20% and Local Deals and Getaways revenue increased by approximately 60%.”In November, Travelzoo announced that it worked with a top Chinese consulting firm and they developed a strategy to grow its revenue in China by focusing on social media and mobile channels. The company said this strategy was implemented at the end of September and they expect revenue growth in China in the upcoming quarter. In the Q3 19 earnings call, the company mentioned all costs of the project were expensed in Q3. Therefore, it is possible there will be immediate improvement in Asia Pacific’s financial results in the upcoming quarters.The recent de-escalation of the trade war and the “phase one” agreement with China should also bode well. This should make both the Chinese and U.S. consumer more confident and more willing to spend on discretionary items like vacations.While I do not think it is likely that the company will meet its goal to achieve profitability in China by the end of 2020, I think the stock price could greatly increase if Asia Pacific revenues start to grow and the losses decrease. If the company were to actually meet its objective to attain profitability in Asia Pacific in 2020, this would be a huge catalyst for the stock price.Another potential catalyst for Travelzoo’s stock price is the rollout of its deal-pairing technology showing both hotel and flight information in North America. This technology was rolled out in Europe last year and was met favorably. After the technology was rolled out in Germany, the company said that members that were shown both hotel and flight information “made five times as many bookings as members that were given just a hotel-only deal.” The company also mentioned positive results when the offering was implemented in the U.K., Spain, in France. Revenue growth and profitability improved in Europe after this change.Travelzoo has not announced that the technology has been implemented in North America but this appears to be the case. If you check Travelzoo’s North American vacations webpage, you can find several vacations that offer both hotel and flight information. For instance, here is an example that offers both hotel and flight information (after you click on the “Continue” button) and here is an example that offers an option to book the hotel only or book the hotel and flight. The company still seems to be testing the format but as a frequent visitor of Travelzoo’s website, this only seems to have been implemented in the last month or so.North America makes up over 60% of Travelzoo’s revenue so the rollout in North America should be a positive catalyst, especially considering the positive response already experienced in Europe.This year and last year Travelzoo’s stock price bottomed out after the company reported disappointing results in their seasonally weakest quarter (Q3). Last year the stock price stayed weak through the end of December due to tax-loss selling but this year the stock price is already starting to trend up. The stock price is not that far from its support in the $9.5 range so it is still a good time to pick up shares. Please refer to the chart below.The next two quarters will be Travelzoo’s seasonally strongest quarters and the previously-mentioned catalysts should result in improved financial results. I think the stock price has bottomed out and is only going up from here.Travelzoo is a microcap company with a small float so good and bad quarterly results can have a large effect on the stock price. The company has been buying back shares so the float continues to get smaller. In 2018, the company announced a share repurchase of 500,000 shares which has been completed and in 2019, the company announced a share repurchase of 1,000,000 shares which is still ongoing. The share count has been steadily decreasing which means when there is high investor demand the stock price can increase rapidly.In fact, there have been two times in the past when the stock price of Travelzoo has gone from the current price level to over $100 in less than a year. While I do not anticipate a gain of that magnitude, I do think the stock price can revisit the $20 level seen in the last couple of years.My bullish argument for buying Travelzoo mainly lies on the speculation that the company’s Asia Pacific 2020 strategy and deal-pairing technology rollout in North America are going to result in improved financial performance in the upcoming quarters. Obviously, if neither of these catalysts pan out, the stock price is not going to benefit.Also, as previously mentioned, Travelzoo is a low float micro-cap stock with a history of volatility.I think now is a good time to buy shares in Travelzoo. The stock price has bottomed out and is trending up and the previously mentioned catalysts should drive gains in the upcoming year. Please do your own due diligence."
4384992,49481,2020-11-04T16:48:24-05:00,Cost cuts and revenue recovery have both exceeded my expectations.Significant cash balances from voucher sales have eliminated near-term liquidity risk.High-quality business with significant upside from any rebound in the travel market.,"Travelzoo (TZOO) is an internet-based marketing firm that features deals and specials for the travel industry. The company curates a list of deals and provides them to subscribers by email and social media on a recurring basis. The attention that they get from their subscribers (who are a high propensity-to-travel group) has been valuable, and they sell ads for placement in their various publications.The shares are up over 50% since I first published on the firm in May, but I think they have further to run. In that article, I made a number of assumptions about how the COVID-19 pandemic would affect their business. I also assumed they would shut down their money-losing Asia business and expenses would decrease as a result. After assuming deep losses and some financing costs associated with covering the cash deficit in 2020, I came to a price target of $8.99 per share. I now believe that price target is too conservative, so I wanted to re-visit the name, as I think there is a strong case for buying it right now.One big thing that I wasn't expecting was their success selling vouchers (see example below). The firm has pivoted from selling advertising to selling vouchers for travel. Essentially, they contract with travel providers (mostly hotels and resorts) to offer a bargain deal on future travel. The company then collects the cost of the voucher in advance, and the customer can use it later on specified dates. This allows them to collect the entire booking fee now, and gives them a good base of commission business that will convert to revenue once travel re-opens. To attract customers, these deals are fully refundable, so there will definitely be refunds due to some customers. However, they are holdings tens of millions of dollars of cash which they can use in the meantime. In fact, their cash balance is over $50M as of their most recent quarter.Source: Travelzoo.comNow, that $50M of cash doesn't entirely belong to them, as they would have to pass the majority on to the travel supplier if the customer uses the deal, or refund the entire amount if they don't. But much like an insurance company's float, they have use of it in the meantime. And that is stopping them from needing external financing to cover their COVID-19 related losses. The firm had no debt prior to the pandemic, but raising debt during it would have been expensive. I had estimated $6.5M of finance charges prior to the business recovering, and instead they will be collecting interest (likely nominal due to interest rates) on their large cash balances.The other place the company has beaten my expectations since my original write-up is on the expense side. I assumed they would be able to cut all the expense from their Asia-Pacific operations, which they were shutting down, and that they'd trim elsewhere. Based on those assumptions, I came up with an estimate for their annual expenses of between $62M and $72M. But in their most recent quarter, expenses were only $12.1M, for an annualized rate of $48.4M! That is a very significant beat by the firm. Importantly, they indicated on their recent conference call that they expect those expense levels to persist going forward:Those reductions in expenses will be key, because the other place I was probably off on my model was the revenue for 2021. In May, it seemed at least possible that travel demand would be returning in 2021, so I modelled 2021 as down 20% from 2019 and then adjusted for an acquisition and the shutdown of their Asia business. I now think that is probably too aggressive. That is especially true given a number of European countries are returning to lockdown, which essentially eliminates travel in those markets in the near-term, which is important for their large European operations.I'm going to assume that their Q3 2020 results, which were essentially break-even, are all they can maintain for a year. Their backlog of sold vouchers will provide a significant tailwind once people start travelling again, as they'll be able to book their commission from those vouchers as revenue once the vouchers are used.One reason I believe they have done so well relative to travel industry competition during the COVID-19 pandemic is their focus on deals and leisure travelers. Leisure travel is likely to come back sooner than corporate travel, as people are more willing to take a risk for themselves than for their employer. Also, those who are traveling are very likely to want to get a deal on the travel, which should increase the percentage of the market that is addressable by Travelzoo. Even if total travel is down, if they can increase their market share that will provide an offset.The other offset is that travel suppliers (tour companies, hotels, etc.) will be motivated by their fixed capacity and high fixed costs to increase occupancy. But if vendors decrease their prices across the board, they lose revenue even from their loyal customers who might pay more. By providing deals through an aggregator like Travelzoo, they can provide promotional pricing to the deal-focused to drive occupancy, while still holding rate on their core business. This is a form of price discrimination, and travel providers are likely to be more aggressive with that in the near term as they deal with significant vacancy.That benefits Travelzoo in two important ways. They have a limited number of ad inventory, and if demand by travel suppliers increases, it is possible they'll be able to charge more for it. It is also probable that the quality of the deal required to get into the newsletter will improve. If suppliers are offering better deals to their readers, that improves the value proposition of the Travelzoo newsletter for customers, making them more likely to book the deals and share the newsletter with friends. This has a bit of a flywheel affect, as better deals earn more subscribers, and more subscribers means Travelzoo has more leverage to get better deals.Considering these factors, and the potential for a vaccine to be in widespread use within the next year, I'm going to assume that they are able to restore North American and Asian revenue to 2019 levels one year from now.The big potential upside that I'm not accounting for is the potential of their recent Jack's Flight Club acquisition. The company purchased a subscription business focused on flight deals. Essentially, consumers could buy a subscription to use a flight deal finding system for a small annual fee. This is different than their existing advertising business, because of the recurring revenue. That makes it much more stable than a commission or advertising based model. Jack's is based in the UK, where the vast majority of its customers reside. Their expressed strategy for the business was to roll out the Jack's model across Europe and North America, and give it an initial push by marketing to their existing Travelzoo subscriber base. Intuitively, it seems likely that someone interested in the hotel, cruise, activity, and tour deals offered by Travelzoo might also be interested in the air travel deals offered by Jack's. They had good traction when they promoted Jack's to their UK subscriber base, and I would expect that to hold true in their bigger North American and continental-European markets as well. They haven't launched that yet, which I think makes sense. It isn't likely that the pandemic is a good time to launch a new travel subscription, but I think there is potential for significant upside from that rollout. Becoming a more subscription heavy business would also have the potential to improve their multiple, as Jack's is in many ways a software-as-a-service entity. All that said, I'm going to use Q3 2020 revenue from Jack's as my go-forward assumption, which leaves plenty of room for them to outperform.To value the firm, I'm going to make a go-forward earnings estimate. I've assumed that they will be back to 80% of 2019 revenue levels in a year from now. I'm further adjusting 2019 revenue by removing Asian revenue (as they shut that business down) and adding their most recent quarter revenue from Jack's annualized (as they didn't own it in 2019). That suggests a ""mostly recovered"" revenue number of $88M. Their current expense run-rate is only $48M. For conservatism, I'll assume they aren't able to keep things that low on the expense side and use my previous expense estimate for 2021 of $72M. That leaves an earnings estimate of $16M. Using the same 12X earnings multiple I used in my previous analysis suggests a market capitalization of $192M, or $16.98 per share. Taking off another 10% for the time value of money in the year where I assume they are only breaking even provides a price target of $15.28. That is approximately double the current $7.57 share price.There are obviously significant uncertainties here, especially around the length and depth of the ongoing pandemic. However, the underlying business is of good quality, with minimal capital expenditure required. If they can grow their subscription business on the other side of the pandemic, a 12X earnings multiple will likely prove extremely conservative, so it is possible that the shares will outpace this price target. It is also possible that they will begin to lose money again if economies move back into more of a lockdown phase. However, I think their significant cash balances will insulate them from any liquidity challenges until the other side of the pandemic, which is more than can be said about many other travel related businesses."
4265915,21228,2019-05-22T16:58:10-04:00,"Travelzoo is up substantially since my initial recommendation to buy the stock. I think now is a good time to take profits and potentially go short.I think the odds of disappointment in the upcoming quarter are greater than the odds of beating expectations.The stock price is trading near multi-year highs, so a disappointing quarter can result in a huge drop in share price due to the volatility of Travelzoo.A protracted trade war with China will not bode well for Travelzoo's Asia Pacific 2020 initiative or for the overall markets.","I recommended buying shares of Travelzoo (TZOO) earlier this year. Since then, the company has reported a couple of strong quarters of earnings growth, and the stock price is up substantially. I think now is a good time to sell and take profits because the company reported its seasonally strongest quarter in Q1, and the stock price is trading near the top end of its range for the past few years. I believe there is a good chance the company is going to miss analyst expectations for Q2 2019, which could result in a significant drop in share price similar to last year. Also, the trade war with China may intensify, which could result in a sell-off in the broader markets and also impede Travelzoo's ability to turn around its Asia Pacific division.My primary reason for recommending Travelzoo was the company implemented a change to their hotel booking platform that allowed users to see a combined price for hotels and flights instead of just hotel price information. This change was first rolled out in Germany in September of 2018 and later to the U.K., Spain, and France in October of 2018. Based on the company's press releases, the new technology was met very favorably in Europe.Since this change, the company has reported a couple of quarters of earnings growth, but revenue growth has been very modest. In Q4 2018 earnings per share went up 0.08 year over year (0.13 in Q4 2018 versus 0.05 in Q4 2017), but revenue was only up 2% in constant currencies. In Q1 2019, earnings per share went up 0.06 year over year (0.26 in Q1 2019 versus 0.20 in Q1 2018), but revenue growth was only up 3% in constant currencies.In my opinion, this minimal revenue growth is very disappointing. In the Q1 2018 earnings call, the CEO mentioned he wanted ""to accelerate top line growth and double the size of the company in the next few years"". One of the strategic initiatives he mentioned in the earnings call was the ""packaging"" technology that included combining hotels and airfare together in one package. So far, this technology has only delivered minimal revenue growth, and if more substantial revenue growth is not achieved in future quarters, then investors may discount how much they are willing to bid up the share price of Travelzoo.According to Yahoo Finance, there is one analyst who is providing estimates for the upcoming quarter, and they are projecting revenue of 29.6 million and EPS of 0.07. This would imply revenue growth of 5.4% YOY and an EPS increase of 0.03 YOY. Based on revenue growth in the last two quarters (2% and 3%), I think it will be hard for the company to match the revenue forecast. Travelzoo may potentially beat the EPS forecast by a few cents, based on the last couple of quarters, but I don't think this would be sufficient to keep the stock price trading near multiyear highs.I think the odds of disappointment for next quarter's results are greater than the odds of a strong quarter that will send the share price higher. If the company misses on both revenue and earnings, this could result in a substantial decline due to the low float and volatility of the stock price.Travelzoo's stock price is currently trading near the high point of its trading range for the last several years. In a similar situation last year, the stock price peaked above $18 when solid Q1 earnings were announced and then found support in the $16-17 range. The stock price jumped up to $20 just before Q2 earnings were announced but expectations of growth were much higher last year after the CEO's previously mentioned comments to double the size of the company. I am not sure if investors will be willing to keep the stock price at this level for as long this year because growth projections are not panning out. Also, the company ended up disappointing in Q2 2018, and the stock price quickly went down so investors may be afraid of a repeat this year.In addition, the stock price recently made a similar jump to above $18 after Q4 2018 results were announced in February. Within a few weeks, the stock price made a quick retreat to the $12-13 range. This volatility may make investors more skittish and quicker to take profits.A big problem for Travelzoo has been the company's inability to grow its Asia Pacific division. This division has reported consistent losses since the company bought the business from Travelzoo owners in 2015. To turn around this division, the company is implementing an Asia Pacific 2020 strategy that has the goal to take Asia Pacific to positive operating margins in the next two years. The company has appointed Scott Wang as the General Manager of Greater China to lead this initiative.It is reasonable to assume that this initiative will lead to higher costs to grow that division. However, the trade war may make Chinese customers more hesitant to buy from a U.S. company. Higher costs with potentially lower sales would not bode well.Also, the markets still seem to be pricing in some near-term agreement between the United States and China. If there is a protracted trade war, which seems more and more likely, this would assuredly result in a sell-off in the overall markets. In this scenario, investors may be quicker to sell risky micro-cap stocks such as Travelzoo.Travelzoo shares have almost doubled in share price since my initial recommendation to buy them, and I think now is a good time to take profits since the share price is near multi-year highs. There has been earnings growth in the last two quarters, but revenue growth has been disappointing, in my opinion. I think the odds are greater that the company is going to miss expectations than beat them in the upcoming quarter which could result in a substantial decline in share price. Also, a protracted trade war with China will most likely result in the sell-off of the overall market and risky stocks like Travelzoo. I think it is wise to take profits.I personally have already sold my shares, and I have bought put options in anticipation of a decline. Please do your own due diligence."

Since then, revenue has been in continual decline.Both the advertising and local deals businesses have no competitive moats.Management spent ~$16 million over the last two years on buybacks to possibly keep the share price at mid-teens despite no apparent undervaluation.The stock is likely fairly valued at its current ~$6 price per share and ~0.58x P/S. There may be a near-term rebound, though we struggle to see any long-term upside.","We struggle to find any particular reason to be bullish on Travelzoo (TZOO) stock. Aside from the near-term rebound opportunity due to being down ~50% post the COVID-19 selloff, the stock offers little to no upside in the long term. The business is in a secular decline as key metrics continue to weaken. It is, however, still just one of the many challenges at present. From a high-level view, the business lacks strategic direction and competitiveness. Moreover, COVID-19 will put more pressure on the travel industry and the business due to the drastic drop in demand.What Travelzoo does is aggregate travel and local deals from airlines, hotels, and other travel operators, and then distribute them to its users by mobile app and newsletter. It earns commission revenue through voucher sales and performance advertising revenues from travel companies listing their offers on Travelzoo. Given the nature of the business, technically all of the travel giants such as Expedia (EXPE) or Booking Holdings (BKNG) can easily drive Travelzoo out of business. As a result, of all the many risk factors we see in the stock, the lack of a competitive moat is the most severe risk.(TZOO. source: stockrow)It has been difficult for Travelzoo to grow both its business and market share. Having reached $170.6 million of annual revenue in 2013, revenue has since then declined by ~34% to ~$111 million in 2019. In the process, shareholder value has been destroyed. The stock plunged ~60% from ~$29 at its peak in 2013 to approximately ~$11 before the COVID-19 hit in early 2020. It is now trading at merely ~$6 per share. Within the same period, the giants such as Booking Holdings and Expedia have almost doubled and tripled their revenues as they acquire the lion's share of the online travel market.(Search trends on Travelzoo. Source: Google Trends)If it has not just yet, the lack of visibility and brand recognition will also definitely hurt Travelzoo in the long run. Based on its 10-K, Travelzoo spent merely ~$10 million on advertising last year, though it is unknown how much is being spent on Google, one of the main traffic drivers for the travel giants. So far, the Google search activities for Travelzoo-related keywords have been in continuing downward trends for years. As a micro-cap and standalone brand, this is the key area where we believe Travelzoo will struggle against the online travel giants. Expedia and Booking collectively control globally renowned travel sites such as Trivago, Booking.com, Priceline, Hotels.com, or Agoda. All these sites generate hundreds of millions of page views that end up driving both conversions and online presence for each other.The online travel industry is a winner-take-all market to some extent, and as such, we found it difficult to see how Travelzoo can turnaround the situation. The $12 million acquisition of Jack Flight Club/JFC, which was a good deal, maybe just be enough to boost growth in the next few years to make Travelzoo an attractive takeover target. As of Q4 2019, this was the only good story around the stock. JFC sells a subscription plan for users to get alerts on cheap travel deals. It has no debt and also has over 50% net profit margin.There is a cross-sell opportunity by introducing the services to 30 million of Travelzoo members. As the management mentioned in the Q4 earnings call, JFC alone will contribute an additional 5% revenue growth and an additional $0.2 EPS in 2020. Considering a smooth integration of the business into Travelzoo, it is likely that the combined segment can grow bigger than Travelzoo's Local Deals business. The revenue from the Local Deals segment declined by ~10% YoY to $15.2 million in 2019.With virtually no growth and the pressure from COVID-19, it will take some time for the stock to rebound to ~$11 per share, which is where it was in January 2020. The P/S is now below 1x at 0.58x, while it is now trading at ~$6 per share. In our view, this may be a fair price.(source: company's 10-K)In the last two years, the management has spent over ~$16 million on stock buybacks that potentially drove the price up. However, at no point over the last two years did we feel the stock was undervalued whatsoever. As discussed, the business has continually been in decline for some time. At $6 per share, there may be a near-term upside for opportunistic investors to come in today and exit after the rebound happens. Aside from that, however, the overall long-term outlook is lackluster."
3471536,69905,2015-08-27T11:58:05-04:00,Strong balance sheet with cash greater than total liabilities.Debt free business with strong ROE.Trading for less than 5 times EBIT.,"OverviewTravelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) is an Internet media company which informs users about travel and entertainment deals. The outlook for the next few quarters and into next year is bleak and does not inspire much optimism, hence the price tag. Investors willing to buy at the current price will be rewarded with a satisfactory return.Liquidity's financial positionBalance sheetWithin the last year the balance sheet has improved considerably. Cash now makes up materially more than the total liabilities of the ongoing business. Holding $55m in cash with no debt offers Travelzoo a lot of financial flexibility to pursue its growth strategy as well as to continue with its repurchase program.When digging into the balance sheet, what becomes particularly noteworthy is that over the past 5 years one uncovers that although earnings have been very volatile the assets of the company have not. In fact, the total assets have grown by over 37% over the 5 year span, primarily driven through the growth of cash. Furthermore, one can see that Travelzoo's business model is not capital intensive as the growth of 33% was accomplished with only a 4% increase in working capital.Earnings and cash flow analysisOver the past five years the operating income has averaged $17m. The enterprise value is less than 5 times the last five years average operating income. The ROIC over the last five years averaged 24% and a ""Greenblatt ROIC"" greater than 40% makes this company rather good. In spite of its volatile earnings over the last five years, the underling business model and its balance sheet tell us a very different story.Travelzoo's revenue has been relatively stable. Not much growth to speak of and certainly no match for TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP). Although Travelzoo's earnings have been very volatile management have been very efficient and have bought back slightly more than 10% of the outstanding shares while increasing the amount of cash on the balance sheet by more than 30% all the while keeping the balance sheet debt free. Below are some highlighted items from the cash flow statement.There are few items worth discussing. Of material importance is how little was spent in capital expenditure over the last 5 years. For every $3 spent on capital expenditures $18 cash has come back into the business. This is outstanding. Management did not squander the company's hard earned earnings but were proactive with share repurchases in four out of the five last years (more details below).Growth strategyThe graph below depicts Travelzoo's growth strategy. It is focused on two main avenues.Audience growthTravelzoo states that it plans on investing more in marketing both online and offline to get new members. Generally it is said that it cost nine times more to acquire a new customer than to keep an existing one, so the fact that Travelzoo acknowledges that it is more expensive to acquire a new members should come as no surprise. To acquire new members Travelzoo intends on increasing its marketing spend each quarter by $0.10-$0.15 EPS. For a company that is barely breaking even and likely to be running at a loss over the next couple of quarters this will give the bears yet further proof that Travelzoo's fundamentals are in fact deteriorating.Revenue is generated through listing fees paid by travel and entertainment companies. The revenue generated is based on the audience reach of the listing. Therefore, more members means greater revenue. However, to be counted as a member all one needs to do is submit an email address. Currently, Travelzoo boasts of approximately 27 million subscribers but it is really struggling to monetize these subscribers as can be seen in the chart below.The charts above shows that as the member number goes up, revenue and earnings go down. Furthermore, when management is asked to disclose the ROI per member acquisition it declines to respond. This lack of transparency by the management shows that they are aware of the problem they are having monitizing their members.Product enhancementOver the last year, Travelzoo's management has put a lot of effort into changing the underlying business from a push to pull platform. I will explain what this means with a personal example. Last year, I am at home minding my own business and I decide on the spot to go on holiday. I have no idea of where to go, so I look online and Travelzoo suggest a trip to Kos, Greece. Brilliant, I go and have a wonderful time. This year, I have special occasion and I want to go to a specific location, the Canary Islands. And Travelzoo does not offer me this option and so I go on TripAdvisor and they allow me to search and find what I am looking for. This is the problem facing Travelzoo; with so much option online and so few options through Travelzoo, the company must adapt to changing consumer preferenecs or face extintion. Management is well aware of this problem and are putting a lot of investment and energy into tackling this problem. One of the ideas management have come up with is a new hotel booking platform. This will allow users to search a greater number of products. Whether Travelzoo will be successful remains to be seen.Travelzoo adds two new members to its BoardThe appointment of two new Board members brings with them further depths and expertise to Travelzoo. Ms. Tsay, vice president of HP software is an expert at growing consumer internet and enterprise businesses as well as pioneering new business models and strategies. And Ms. Tarka, founder and CEO of Mobissimo a travel search engine. Both additions are crucial to Travelzoo's development of its search function of its new hotel booking platform.Travelzoo Asia Pacific business (""APAC"")Travelzoo reacquires its old business in Asia Pacific from Mr. Bartel for slightly over twice its 2014 annual revenue $10.8m.This move is done in the hope of making Travelzoo's brand stronger and more global. On the face of it the price paid appears to be fair. Additionally, its worth remembering that $42m of Travelzoo's cash is held outside of the US. Repatriating it would have huge tax implications. Doing this acquisition could have been the best use of its cash.Insider stock ownershipAs of July 2, 2015 Ralph Bartel, who founded Travelzoo and who is a Director of the Company holds via Azzurro Capital Inc. 50.4% of the outstanding shares. As recently as July 2, 2015 Mr. Bartel purchased $2m worth of shares in Travelzoo. Possibly with the expectation of the merger with APAC, as company was previously owned by him. Therefore, it's safe to state that with this much interest in Travelzoo he will do everything in his power to ensure that the Travelzoo shareholder will get maximum value out of the company.Share repurchasesOver the last five years more than 10% of the outstanding share capital has been repurchased. I suspect that further repurchases could be announced soon, as the share price is at a five year low and Travelzoo has been regularly repurchasing its shares as the table below shows.ValuationOn a discounted cash flow basis this company is conservatively worth around $12-$14 per share (at the current number of outstanding shares without the benefit of any share repurchases). I have calculated for an annualized growth of 11%-12% over the next 5 years (far below the Group's historical growth rate of 15% over the last 10 years) and 3-3.5% thereafter. I have discounted future cash flows at 10%. These are my estimates only and actual results may vary.RelativelyThe table below compares the current multiples the company trades at with the multiples the company traded at on average over the last five years. This is something that Walter Schloss used to do (my all-time favorite investor) and I have found that my investment returns improve when buying stocks that trade at low multiples when compared with the average multiples investors paid over the last five years. It's worth remembering that because Travelzoo's earnings are depressed it skews the multiples the stock currently trades at, however, even with the multiples skewed it is still cheaper than it has been over the last 5 years. I have also shown how its current multiples compare with the current multiples of some of its public traded peers. It also trades cheaper than its peers. Critics would argue that Travelzoo's business model is flawed and that it is struggling to adapt to the competition. I would argue that the bleakest outlook is already accounted for at the current share price.The streets estimateSource: Yahoo! FinanceThe street has a very negative outlook for this company. But even with this in mind the street still projects some growth into next year.ConclusionThere is a mix bag of positives and negatives to investing in Travelzoo. Overall, Travelzoo is a good, robust business as demonstrated by its strong balance sheet. Its revenue and earnings are depressed because of a combination of competition, change in consumer preferences and its spending initiative to acquire more members and of a greater quality. At this price the downside is limited and there is an upside potential to around $12-$14 per share."
4009006,101663,2016-09-28T14:13:52-04:00,"We estimate current new member acquisitions have a negative ROI. If it is unable to reverse this trend in the long term, the company is worthless.The true underlying cost of new members is approximately 4x higher than the company reports.Its business is dying as revenue remains in long term decline due to competitive pressure and lower ad rates in mobile vs. desktop. Mobile is now 50% of ads and growing.This has forced the company to transition its revenue to hotel bookings. This will cannibalize existing revenue. Larger competitors like Kayak have attempted this transition and failed.Google Trends search for ""travelzoo"" has been a good predictor of revenue. Search trends for ""travelzoo"" remain in decline with no bottom in sight.","Cliffside Research is pleased to announce a compelling short thesis on Travelzoo, Inc. (NASDAQ:TZOO). TZOO is overvalued by at least 50% and long term, we make the case that the stock could approach zero. For the entire ""strong sell"" thesis, please visit our website.Overview:TZOO came public during the tech boom days in 1998. The stock has been on a roller coaster ride ever since, twice breaching $100 per share in a burst before eventually crashing back to Earth just as quickly. Its ""technology"" is old, outdated, clunky and at times difficult to use. This is directly the result of years of under-investment as it has strictly run the business to maximize cash flows. We are big fans of maximizing cash flows but in TZOO's case, it has maximized them for short-term gains and to the long-term detriment of the business. This strategy had worked for several years as the business was able to grow revenue despite the lack of unique technology but in 2013, its revenue growth run ended and now it's time to pay the piper. The company is now attempting to return to growth via a hotel booking platform but we believe this strategy will fail.How did it get here? Most executive management teams find themselves reassuring analysts while walking down overly aggressive expectations. Often it's not a matter of growth, but investment in the future of the company that delays the near-term earnings euphoria for long-term earnings sustainability. TZOO finds itself in the opposite camp. The company has largely been run profitably over several years but it has mainly relied on what worked in 1998 to do so, an advertising-based vacation deals email newsletter. It calls those who sign up for its newsletters ""members"" but its members are mainly just an email distribution list. While the competition has promoted and invested in product to improve functionality, ease of use and increased engagement on multiple platforms for the consumer, TZOO chose to mainly focus on its vacation deals email list. Despite more recent attempts to push into mobile apps and social, this simple email list is still the major driver of revenues even now in 2016. First, we'll review TZOO's competitive position and then we'll breakdown current sources of revenue.Blurred Lines - Where Does TZOO Fit?Within the travel category, there are four or five major buckets a company can fit in. The categories include online travel agent (OTA), customer review, metasearch, back-end systems and Internet advertising. Increasingly, they all do a little of each. Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) are generally considered OTAs and they currently dominate the category. However, they are also major players in all the other categories. For example, Priceline's Kayak and Expedia's Trivago would be examples of metasearch sites. Metasearch sites search several different travel providers for the best price, but due to consolidation, the options increasingly are dominated by PCLN and EXPE. TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) is a customer review site, but it now has rolled out its own hotel booking platform and advertising largely drives its revenue. TRIP is also a metasearch provider. On the back-end, we include B2B service providers, hotel management systems and the like. PCLN is increasingly a major player in this category as it looks to build deep, sticky relationships with the supply base. Then there's Airbnb (AIRB) and the ""home sharing"" category, which is a whole other ball of wax but clearly is another competitor in hotel booking.As you might imagine, these industries are tech-heavy, highly competitive and extremely innovative. TZOO is none of that. TZOO is loosely considered a media publisher, but really it is mainly known as a travel package and local deals advertising platform. It distributes an advertising newsletter to an email list. The model hasn't changed much in its 18 years. It has added mobile apps and is attempting to monetize social but if it is having major success monetizing these options, it has been keeping that secret to itself.For example, mobile apps have become a major component of travel bookings. Several travel apps rank well above TZOO. In the travel category of the newly released iOS 10, there are dozens of travel apps available. TZOO's app is not featured at all. An app store search for ""travel,"" a word that is in its name, has it listed as the 25th option. A search for ""hotel"" lists it as the 38th option.Revenue Breakdown:TZOO's three sources of revenue are travel, search and local.Travel:Travel revenue includes travel publications, which consists of its Top 20 newsletter, Newsflash email alert service, websites, and network revenue consisting of third-party websites that list TZOO published travel deals. In addition, ""local getaway"" vouchers and the hotel booking platform revenue also fall in the travel category. When TZOO references ""members"" it is referring to the 28.9mil email accounts that have signed up for its email newsletters, mainly the Top 20 newsletters. Although it is unclear exactly what percent of this division is driven by advertising revenue, it's safe to assume that the vast majority is from advertising. This division is the foundation that the business was founded on in 1998.Travel has been in a steady decline for the company since 2014. Major drivers of the decline include declining advertising rates due to the move to mobile, lost customers, increased competition and FX. With the exception of FX, we believe the trends impacting it are long term in nature, not likely to reverse course and cause the company to be seen as increasingly irrelevant to advertisers and consumers alike.Currently, TZOO is rolling out its hotel booking platform. It first began rolling out the platform in Q2 of 2014. The rollout has been extremely slow and cautious. To date, it still has not rolled out the platform worldwide. Success in the hotel booking platform is critical for TZOO. It has been extremely guarded about the platform and has not released any meaningful information regarding the percent of revenue it now represents. The company expects its hotel revenue to increasingly shift to this platform over time. We believe this is a major transition for the company and an extremely negative development for several reasons. Here are five key reasons.Search:Search revenue includes SuperSearch and Fly.com pay-per-click advertising revenue. These products fall in the ""metasearch"" category with competitors like Priceline's Kayak or Expedia's Trivago and others. Search has been in decline, and the company expects the decline to continue. The decline has been driven by intense competition and the move to mobile, which the company has found difficult to monetize. TZOO has been scaling back spend on traffic acquisition for several quarters. As a result, the search product is increasingly irrelevant to the marketplace.Local:Local revenue includes local deal vouchers and entertainment non-vouchers. Local deals and the local ""getaways"" product (included in travel revenue) were the main drivers of increased revenue beginning in late 2010 through mid-2012. These products compete with providers like Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and Living Social. In yet another example of a reactionary mindset, we believe TZOO entered this space due to competitive pressure. In mid-2012, local revenue began a long, steady decline that continues today. The decline is driven by several factors including competition, declining demand and decreased take rate (commission) earned from merchants for vouchers sold.TZOO has claimed in the past that the segment has suffered from irrational competitors that are offering money-losing deals in local. TZOO has chosen to focus on profitability at the expense of lost market share. We believe this is the correct decision, but it means this division is unlikely to be a driver of meaningful revenue or income growth going forward.Changing consumer habits have also impacted local revenue. As competition has increased and consumers have acclimated to the ""deals"" voucher concept, they are increasingly choosing to purchase vouchers at the time they are planning to use them rather than on impulse. This change in consumer mindset from ""push"" to ""pull"" has also been blamed for the decline.Source: SEC Filings & Cliffside ResearchSource: SEC Filings & Cliffside ResearchThe APAC division was acquired in Q3 2015. The chart below restates revenue as if APAC had been acquired in Q1 2013 for comparison purposes. We note that no region is experiencing growth and all are in long-term decline. Total Revenue and North America revenue peaked in 2013 and show no signs of recovery. The Q1 and Q2 uptick are purely seasonal in nature and down year over year.Source: SEC Filings & Cliffside ResearchTerrorism Likely Impacts Q3 & Q4 and Beyond:In its most recent quarterly call, the company acknowledged that terrorism had an impact on its quarter and it expects the impact to be greater in both Q3 & Q4 this year. CEO Holger Bartel explained in great detail on the call how their business is impacted in two ways. First, in places where there have been terrorist activities like France, Belgium, Germany and Turkey, the advertisers don't want to advertise travel packages. Interestingly, Turkey happens to have been a very popular destination for European travelers. Mr. Bartel stated that, ""a year or two ago, Turkey was probably one of the most popular destinations promoted in our UK Top 20, now it happens very rarely."" The UK represented 19% of TZOO's revenue in 2015, so this is significant. TZOO, wisely, is also not looking to advertise high-risk areas like Egypt, for example.The second impact comes from its members who, of course, are less interested in traveling to those destinations, but are instead choosing destinations that are perceived as safe like Spain and Portugal. These popular destinations are very busy and it's far more difficult for TZOO to find good deals in these locations. In fact, these destinations are now so popular that the locals in some cases have written graffiti encouraging tourists to leave and politicians are considering several measures to cap tourism. Since TZOO is mainly known as a last-minute travel deal provider, this is further hurting its business. Unfortunately, due to recent events, New York City also may be an area vacation travelers increasingly avoid. Travel to the US by foreigners has been one of the areas of strength for TZOO and New York City is one of the top destinations.Ultimately, we believe none of these developments are welcome for small travel-focused operations like TZOO that are likely to be impacted more than larger, diversified organizations. We argue that when vacationers feel both fearful to travel to some regions and unwelcome in others, it is more likely to stay home. We feel this trend will likely continue as consumers opt for more ""staycations"" in coming years. These cheaper packages likely won't generate the same kind of advertising rates and commissions for TZOO, further widening the gap to its much larger competitors.Google Search As A Predictor of Revenue:Searching for ""travelzoo"" on Google appears to be a good predictor of TZOO's revenue and can be found here. Google searches for ""travelzoo"" peaked in June 2011. TZOO's revenue peaked in the March quarter of 2013 and, as we mentioned, has been declining since. There are several points of note with the charts below. The blue line represents the percentage of searches for ""travelzoo"" vs. peak searches in June 2011. As you can see, ""travelzoo"" is currently about 35% of peak. All the annual peaks tend to land around June.There is an interesting seasonal ""M"" pattern that is very consistent. The left peak of the ""M"" is usually December and the right peak is usually June of the following year. As searches for ""travelzoo"" were increasing from 2004-2011, the right peak of the ""M"" tends to be higher than the left, indicating increased search momentum for ""travelzoo."" Once searches peak in 2011, the left side is higher, indicating searches for ""travelzoo"" have lost momentum. We believe this is directly the result of increased competition and the move by consumers to mobile devices. Relative to peers, TZOO is a very small player in travel. It will be very difficult for the company to regain momentum. While its business and by extension its relevance to advertisers has shrunk, its much larger competitors have kept growing. This further widens the gap and makes it that much more difficult for TZOO to return the business to growth.It's also important to note that much of its revenue growth in recent years came from the launch of local deals in late 2010 and local getaways in 2011 to compete with Groupon and Living Social. Entry into these categories pushed revenues to the peak in March 2013. Local deals and local getaways are no longer a driver of the business but a drag on revenue. It does not appear that this trend will improve in the near term as management appears focused on slowing the bleed in its core travel advertising segment, which represents the bulk of revenue.We also note that the re-acquired Asia Pacific division has helped boost its revenue in recent quarters. We provide the bright red line to show what revenue would be without the acquisition to show that the underlying business remains on a downward trend. We are now coming upon the weakest part of the year for TZOO (Sept. - Nov.). This will add further pressure to declining revenues.Source: Google Trends, SEC Filings, Cliffside ResearchBelow, we provide a second graph that contains the same data as above but zoomed in showing 2010 to present. The downward trend in Google search for ""travelzoo"" remains firmly in place and likely will get worse as we now begin to enter the seasonally weakest part of the year for TZOO in addition to the terrorism impact. As an example, we highlight the recently completed month of August compared to August 2015. It is clear TZOO still has not turned the corner. The revenue data ends with the June quarter. We fully expect Q3 & Q4 revenue to follow the search trend downward.Source: Google Trends, SEC Filings, Cliffside ResearchEntry Into the ""Local"" Division Didn't Save It:In the 4th quarter of 2010, TZOO had high hopes for its local deals business as it was playing catch-up to Groupon and others. In its presentation for that quarter, it had a slide that indicates the local deals opportunity to be at least $110mil in annual revenue, or a nearly doubling of its annual business from 2010. At the time, it said revenue per member, or subscriber as it called them back then, could reach $14.30.You can see in the chart below that what happened instead was an initial improvement to $8.19 in the 3rd quarter of 2011 followed by a steady decline. In the most recent quarter, revenues per member hit a new low of $4.77. This figure will likely continue to decline over the seasonally weak Q3 and Q4.Source: SEC Filings & Cliffside ResearchWhile revenue per member is continuing a steady decline, average cost per acquisition of a new member is steadily increasing.Source: SEC Filings & Cliffside ResearchTrue Cost of New Members Far Higher Than Reported:The chart above doesn't take into account member churn. Member churn is the result of email unsubscribes by members, or periodic list maintenance for bad email addresses. When we account for churn, or net new members after subtracting out members that are churned out of the base, the cost per net new member is much, much higher. We believe this is a critical discovery for investors in TZOO but it gets worse. The chart also shows that while the company is spending more for net new member adds, it is actually adding far fewer net new members. In fact, in the 4th quarter of 2014, it lost more members than it added despite spending nearly $2mil by our estimates. We believe this was the first time in TZOO's history that it had net negative member adds for a full quarter.Source: SEC Filings & Cliffside ResearchTravelzoo has often explained away the issue of declining net member adds by claiming a focus on higher quality member adds. We don't know how it defines higher quality members. We're only able to analyze the results, and the results tell a different story. As it has spent more to acquire fewer but ""higher quality"" new members, revenue per member has continually declined. The chart below compares revenue per member to the cost of adding net new ""higher quality"" members. It is very clear that despite increasing spend on higher quality new members, revenue per member continues to decline. Simply put, the strategy is not working.Source: SEC Filings & Cliffside ResearchIn the most recent quarter, cost per net new member add was $10.28 and revenue per member was $4.77. This means that unless TZOO is able to improve its revenue per member figures, it will take about 2.15 years for TZOO just to cover the cost of acquiring the new member. It will be even longer for the customer to go from breakeven to profitable. In comparison, in the first quarter of 2010, at the far left of the chart, the time to cover the cost of a new member was about .58 years, or about 7 months.In TZOO's first quarter 2015 call in the Q&A section Holger Bartel was asked about member acquisitions and he states that it takes about two quarters for these more expensive, higher quality members to begin showing results in revenue. A year and a half later, the results still haven't arrived. What gives? We suspect that the quality of the vast majority of the 28.9mil subscribers is far lower than the recently acquired members. That would explain why revenue isn't improving despite TZOO's efforts. Unfortunately, this likely implies many years of investment, as it would have to churn out a large percentage of its member base before revenue per member improves meaningfully. In our opinion, there's no doubt that this is a dying business.Negative Member ROI Trends:Based on the above, we began considering what TZOO's ROI trend might look like for new member acquisitions. TZOO is very protective of its user metrics. It provides no information regarding ROI on its investment in new members or member churn rates. On several earnings calls, analysts have asked for this type of information and management always says maybe it'll have it next time, but the next time it never does. History has taught us that any time a company doesn't want to provide investors information, it's probably not a good thing. Less data is never better. So we tried to see if we could back into some of the data, it doesn't want to provide by further exploring the data that it does provide and we found some interesting points.First, the company appears to have about a 10% average member churn rate over the past several years. That means that each year about 10% of its members leave. Currently it has about 29mil members, so this year we expect it to lose about 2.9mil members. To keep things simple, let's just call it 3mil. That means that to add a net 1mil members to the user base to reach 30mil members, it has to add 4mil new members. Another way to look at this is to say for every four new members it acquires, it loses three (approximately). This is the reason net new member costs are so high. To acquire one net new member it really has to acquire four. Unless it can reduce churn and/or reduce member acquisition costs, this equation only gets worse as the user base grows. That means it likely will need to continue to increase member acquisition costs going forward just to keep the member base where it is.Regarding member ROI what we found is truly shocking. TZOO provides revenue per member and it calculates it by annualizing quarterly revenue and dividing it by members at the beginning of the year. We decided to do the same thing but instead using Non-GAAP net income as provided by the company. That gave us Non-GAPP net income per member by quarter and we calculated that back to 2010. We calculated an ROI based on cost of a new member as provided by the company. TZOO doesn't provide the average life of a member, so for this we had to make an educated guess. Since the churn is 10%, over 10 years, it will basically have replaced all of its members. Based on this, it seems fair to assume the average life of a member is about five years. We feel this is likely generous and if anything it is probably lower. Then we multiplied Non-GAAP net income per member by five years to find the lifetime Non-GAAP net income value per member. From there, it was easy to back out the acquisition cost per new member to get to an estimated member ROI.The results in the chart below show that TZOO's member ROI is likely trending negative and has been since Q3 2014. We believe this largely explains the acquisition of the APAC division in Q3 2015 as the company is essentially trying to pull out of a nosedive. What the chart indicates is that the company is currently spending more on acquiring new members than it can ever reasonably expect to make on them over five years. Since we believe the average life of a member is probably less than five years, the data could actually be considerably worse than our estimates. To put it simply, it is investing in new members for which we expect a NEGATIVE RETURN on its investment!!!Source: SEC Filings & Cliffside ResearchThe recent improvement in the past two quarters is simply the result of staff cuts. We do not see this as a long-term solution to its decline. Two years of investment in ""higher quality"" members is not coming through in results as revenue per member continues to reach new lows.You Can't Cut Your Way To Growth:If you work at TZOO today, you're likely in fear of losing your job and/or looking for another one. Since Ralph Bartel's brother Holger Bartel was reinserted first as Chairman and then as CEO in October 2015, it's been open season on TZOO employees. About 20% of the workforce has been let go and we suspect there's likely more on the way. Cutting the workforce makes up the vast majority of its financial improvement and that has led to a rally in the stock of about 60% off its lows.While there may still be some meat left on the bone, we feel the workforce improvement is now mostly baked into the stock. Certainly, cleaning house is a short-term positive for the company and shareholders, but at some point in the next couple of quarters, we feel it is going to need to show it can actually grow revenue for the stock to continue higher. Attempting to squeeze increased production out of fewer employees may prove to be difficult and ultimately a major mistake. TZOO is a very small company in comparison to peers. The fact that it cannot seem to grow and the only way to improve financial results is to cut employees is a very negative sign for its long-term survivability. As they say, when it comes to business if you're not growing, you're dying.Source: SEC Filings & Cliffside ResearchModel Crumbling Under Intense Competition:How competitive is the travel and local deals business? Not even Jeff Bezos was able to successfully compete. Amazon decided it'd rather stick to easy targets like Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) rather than compete in TZOO's industry. In April of 2015, Amazon rolled out a local hotel booking product called Amazon Destinations. The idea was to offer ""weekend getaway"" destinations similar to TZOO, GRPN, Living Social and others ""getaway"" products. Less than seven months after launch, the division was shutdown with little explanation.On the other hand, Google is increasingly looking to integrate travel into its platform. This makes sense because it can access personal itineraries from Gmail and integrate that information with Search and Maps. These features were just introduced to the new Google Trips app. While Google Trips currently does not include booking capability, it keeps the traveler engaged with Google's mobile platform by attempting to provide a seamless travel experience.Google has also recently launched Google Destinations, a trip planning search feature complete with flight and hotel prices. Google rolled out the Destinations feature on mobile in March and has just released it on desktop this month. These are the kind of changes that could completely destroy TZOO's advertising business, which represents the vast majority of its revenue. No wonder it is diversifying away from advertising. Additionally, it is largely assumed that these entries into travel are the beginning of a move by Google to directly compete with OTAs for bookings.In light of the above, we believe TZOO is experiencing intense competition on nearly every aspect of its current business. It offers nothing unique and is an extremely small player that is only getting smaller. We note that its hotel booking platform has many listings, if not most listings, offered in partnership with Travelscape LLC, a division of EXPE. This makes TZOO nothing more than an added middleman looking for a cut of the pie.Its Business Is Dying:Why is TZOO taking a huge risk attempting to transition its business into a highly competitive category dominated by giants? One word: mobile.As Internet traffic has rapidly transitioned from desktop to mobile advertising rates have come under pressure. This is not good for companies like TZOO who rely on the majority of its revenue from Internet advertising. TZOO has said in its recent 10-K that the switch to mobile is hurting its business because advertisers are not willing to pay the same rates for tiny mobile screens. Mobile doesn't convert as well as desktop. This is a major problem for TZOO's business model and puts it in an extremely precarious situation. While the local and search businesses are struggling, its bread & butter advertising business is also struggling. Additionally, as a very small player in the space, it is only getting smaller as traffic and ad dollars consolidate to larger advertising platforms. It is becoming increasingly irrelevant to both consumers and advertisers over time. Simply put, this is a dying business!So what does a dying business do when it's been forced into a corner? In TZOO's case, it has decided to enter the extremely competitive low margin cut-throat hotel bookings category hoping to slow the bleed. The fact that it has no experience or technological edge in the category doesn't factor into the decision to enter the market for one simple reason; it has no choice. It has been backed into a corner by the move to mobile and competition. In our opinion, it simply doesn't know what else to do. Now it is left with convincing its user base to use it when booking planned travel.On the surface that might not sound like much of a stretch but we believe it is. The competition in the hotel bookings space is so intense, the competitors are so much larger and competing technology is so much better and well established that we feel this will be an extremely difficult market for TZOO to meaningfully penetrate. How much larger is the competition? In 2015, EXPE had sales of $6.7bil and PCLN had sales of $9.2bil. It's estimated that the 2016 gross worldwide travel bookings market is $1.4 trillion and growing yet somehow tiny TZOO can't find growth with a hotel booking platform that's taken it over two years to roll out and counting.Entry into hotel bookings also makes TZOO a competitor to some of its much larger advertising customers. Lastly, we believe that like the local getaways business, which cannibalized its advertising business, the hotel bookings business will also cannibalize its revenue. The takeaway here is that the hotel bookings business should not be looked at as a source of revenue growth. The company alluded to this point on its recent earnings call in what we feel was a very telling explanation of how it sees the hotel bookings businessIn regards to hotel bookings business…Analyst:CEO Holger Bartel then downplays the hotel bookings opportunity:CFO Glen Ceremony follows up stating they are reacting to mobile and implies hotel bookings will cannibalize existing business:When a company says it is shifting"" its revenue, it is cannibalizing revenue.Hotel Bookings Are Not The Answer:EXPE and PCLN have been consolidating the industry for the past several years and now dominate travel bookings. Meanwhile, TZOO has been hung out to dry. For example, Expedia has purchased Hotwire, Travelocity, Orbitz, Trivago and HomeAway. Priceline has purchased Kayak, Booking.com, Hotel Ninjas, Rocketmiles, OpenTable and others. Many of the companies purchased were formed long after TZOO. Why has TZOO been continuously passed over?For one, competitors have continued to innovate and rapidly grow revenue, even smaller competitors that had a far later start than TZOO. From a technology perspective, competitors are years ahead of anything TZOO has to offer. TZOO on the other hand has taken a reactionary approach, only investing in the business model and changing directions when threatened.As if the market for hotel booking wasn't already competitive enough, customer review and metasearch company TripAdvisor entered hotel booking in the US in 2014. Its product, which is called Instant Booking, just fully rolled out globally in the 2nd quarter of this year. This also appears to be a reactionary move as it has also felt a negative impact from the move to mobile. Like TZOO, it mainly relies on Internet advertising revenue to drive its business.Neither TZOO nor TRIP was the first advertising-based travel business to attempt a transition to hotel booking. That title belongs to Kayak. Kayak attempted to enter hotel booking in 2004. Kayak co-founder and CEO Stephen Hafner thinks TripAdvisor will ultimately regret going the hotel bookings route and eventually get out, like it did. So far, TRIP has had a rough go of it in instant bookings. A key metric for TRIP, revenue per hotel shopper was down 19% in Q2 driven by difficulties in transitioning to Instant Booking and mobile trends. TRIP revenue in the quarter was $391mil compared to TZOO at $34mil, or more than 10x TZOO revenue. If TRIP is having a difficult time entering hotel booking and Kayak gave up on it, we believe the far smaller TZOO will find it much more difficult.TZOO Provides No Unique Advantage:As hotel and travel booking has essentially become a duopoly in the past few years, hoteliers have become concerned about the leverage EXPE and PCLN hold over them. Increasingly, they are seeking to protect their room inventory by encouraging bookings on their own websites. TZOO argues it is another option for hoteliers and can push consumers directly to the hotel's website. TZOO feels this gives it an advantage over competitors. However, we've found that EXPE & PCLN are addressing these issues.For example, EXPE has expanded its business in advertising with its Expedia Media Solutions division. We see this as a major threat to TZOO's advertising business. In July of 2015, Expedia Media Solutions launched TravelAds Direct. This is in direct response to the trend by hotels to encourage bookings on their own site instead of with the OTA. With TravelAds Direct, hotels can now advertise on Expedia sites and when the link to the listing is clicked, it takes the customer to a new tab on the hotel's own site.According to Matthew Reichek, senior director of product and analytics for EXPE, ""a supplier-direct product like that would have been unthinkable for Expedia three years ago."" While TZOO is coming after hotel booking dollars with its new offering, EXPE is coming after TZOO's advertising dollars. We believe TZOO will badly lose this battle.This article discusses in great detail EXPE's move into advertising and based on what's described it appears light years ahead of anything TZOO is currently focused on. Additionally, this small internal unit formed in 2007 is already over $200mil in revenue and growing 20% per year. TZOO, formed in 1998 closed out 2015 with $142mil in revenue and declining. In our opinion, TZOO brings nothing to the table that Expedia and Priceline can't do better on their own.This issue also highlights a major point we made in our August initiation on digital advertising company Everyday Health (NYSE:EVDY). Ad budgets go where Internet traffic goes. Within travel, PCLN and EXPE have consolidated traffic through a combination of growth and acquisition but they are not the only places to advertise travel. Increasingly, the largest platforms like Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are consolidating traffic while smaller platforms suffer. These are well-established trends that are long term in nature and not likely to change. As recent as 2007, 50% of consumer Internet traffic came from several thousand websites, today over half the North American traffic comes from only 35 websites. Traffic to TZOO websites peaked in 2011 with 13.8mil unique visitors per month and has been declining ever since. 2011 was also the last year TZOO provided page views.Source: SEC FilingsIn the meantime, while TZOO is working out the kinks on its basic hotel booking platform where it competes with industry giants, the competition is leapfrogging it by looking to the future. In a recent interview, Kayak CEO Steve Hafner said they are investing in ""a lot of artificial intelligence"" and ""services that help younger generations connect with us."" For example, it has a Facebook Messenger chat bot and interaction with Amazon's Alexa service where you can say things like 'Hey Kayak, where can I go this weekend for $300?' That sounds an awful lot like TZOO's turf to us. A few years from now, we don't think TZOO will be able to compete with this kind of technology. It simply doesn't have the technological experience, resources or scale to operate effectively in that kind of environment.TZOO Is Complacent and Lacks Innovation:TZOO's entry into the ""local"" category is a perfect example of its reactionary approach to competition. GRPN was formed in 2009 creating a new, innovative local deals and getaways business model. We believe TZOO immediately recognized the threat of this model to its business. It began competing in local deals in mid-2010. TZOO had about a 10-year head start on Groupon. How was it caught off guard? TZOO could have buttoned up the local deals category for itself years ago if it was forward thinking and innovative, but it let competitors slip in because it was complacent. So instead it was forced to play catch-up with the launch of local deals after Groupon had already leapfrogged it.Initially, local deals were a big growth driver for TZOO and it led to its best year ever in terms of earnings in 2011. In that year, it also launched local ""getaways."" Local getaways compete with Groupon's and Living Social's getaway travel offer. Initially, getaways also helped drive revenue but over time, it became clear that it was actually cannibalizing its much higher-margin advertising-based travel business based on its email list. The space was and remains extremely competitive and as we've discussed, changing consumer purchase behavior has led to weakening results. TZOO's revenue began rolling over in 2013 while GRPN and others also continue to struggle.Groupon remains a major competitive threat to TZOO. 120mil people worldwide have downloaded Groupon's app. In comparison, TZOO has had just over 5mil mobile app downloads. In 2015, Groupon had revenue of $3.1bil compared to $142mil for TZOO. At the time of its IPO in 2011, Groupon had 1,000 deals available worldwide. Now it has 650,000 deals worldwide. TZOO has closer to 1,000. Groupon intends to significantly increase marketing spend to drive customer growth according to its 2015 10-K.We're not arguing that Groupon's uber-aggressive market share at any cost approach has been the path that TZOO should follow. Our argument is that Groupon and TZOO are on opposite ends of the extreme. Groupon formed in 2009 now has revenue of $3.1bil. TZOO formed in 1998 is struggling to stay above $130mil. TZOO's extremely cautious, reactionary approach has led to years of underperformance for shareholders. We believe this is the result of the shareholder structure of the company where one person, the founder, holds a controlling 50+% of the stock.The above point illustrates a concern with TZOO. They are followers not leaders. When TZOO was formed in 1998, it was smart to be cautious and grow slow at first, but as it matured it should have become more aggressive to keep up with competitors that were gobbling up the market. As a small cap company, it can no longer afford to be followers with lagging technology that's consistently late to new markets. Unfortunately for TZOO shareholders, we believe it's already too late.TZOO Isn't Shareholder Friendly:We feel the company largely has been run as the personal piggy bank of founder and current Chief Talent Officer Ralph Bartel. Ralph Bartel currently owns 53% of TZOO. As a result, your vote as a stockholder doesn't count. Ralph Bartel can choose to do whatever he wishes with TZOO and there is nothing you can do about it. This has led to some interesting decisions by the board.For example, in November 2009, TZOO's board approved the sale of its Asia-Pacific (NASDAQ:APAC) division to Azzurro Capital for $3.6mil. Azzurro Capital is 100% owned by TZOO founder, former Chairman and majority shareholder Ralph Bartel. Then last year, only six years after selling the business, TZOO bought the APAC division back from Azzurro Capital for $22.6mil. TZOO also made holders of APAC debt whole and the holder of debt for the APAC division was…you guessed it, Azzurro Capital. TZOO paid $3.4mil including interest to pay back loans made by Azzurro Capital (Mr. Bartel) to the Asia Pacific business. If we include the debt payments the acquisition price paid to Mr. Bartel was $26mil.For most public companies, this kind of activity would raise serious eyebrows. Not for TZOO. Investors seem to have largely ignored the issue. A few travel news blogs have attempted to spin it as a positive for the company. The general consensus has been that the APAC division, which was TZOO's smallest and only started in 2007 was losing money. So Ralph Bartel bought the division to get the losses off TZOO's books during this growth phase. In the meantime, TZOO retained the option to buy the company back anytime between 2011-2020. During this period, Mr. Bartel could grow the APAC business and fund the losses to drive growth himself. Once the business was cash-flowing positively, he could sell it back to TZOO. It's been spun as a win-win for TZOO shareholders, which, of course, also largely benefits Mr. Bartel.There's a problem with this theory. The APAC business is still not cash-flowing positively and the number of APAC ""members"" peaked in 2011-12. Members were still in decline when TZOO purchased APAC. Revenues have also declined from $12mil in 2013 to $10.7mil as of 2015. Regarding the acquisition, former CEO Chris Loughlin was quoted as stating that ""the audience is over 3 million members and we are clearly past the start-up phase."" We would add that the division is not only past the ""start-up"" phase but has quickly moved to the ""decline"" phase. Returning the division to growth will likely require a substantial investment, an investment that TZOO shareholders were supposedly avoiding by selling the division in the first place.Our theory is that when the business was losing money in the 2009 recession, it was easy to sell it cheap, hence the $3.6mil price tag. Since that time the business has grown from about $2mil in revenue in 2009 to over $10mil, albeit now with stalled growth. APAC is still not cash flow positive, yet the company justified paying $22.6mil (plus another $3.4mil in debt repayment to Azzurro) to reacquire the money-losing operation.Our first point should be pretty obvious. Who made money on this deal? Ralph Bartel. While the cash drain from the APAC business was being held off TZOO books, the company was able to post profitable growth in its North American and European divisions. Coupled with a short squeeze, the increased profit led to a large gain in the stock, eventually breaching the $100 per share mark.During this period of extreme valuation beginning in 2011 when the stock at times was valued over 70x peak EPS, Bartel began selling TZOO stock. From April 2011 to February 2013, he sold 3.7mil shares for gross proceeds worth $210,994,952. We're guessing the proceeds from these sales largely offset any investments in the APAC division by a substantial degree.Post these sales, Mr. Bartel still remains the majority shareholder of TZOO with 7.4mil shares or 53% of shares outstanding. The entire market cap of TZOO is $180mil dollars. Sales of TZOO stock have netted Mr. Bartel total gross proceeds over $395mil, more than 2x the entire market cap of TZOO. It's possible he also made a nice gain on the sale of the APAC division back to TZOO, so that's a win-win…for Bartel.If you were a long-term shareholder over this period you would have seen the stock hit over $100 and then promptly drop into the $30s in 2012. Eventually, TZOO meandered its way down into the $8s. The move was triggered by several developments, not least of which was the fact that earnings peaked in 2011 at $1.42 per share. In 2013, a revenue peak followed and TZOO has been dying a slow death ever since.Zika Is A Worldwide Threat and It's Getting Nasty:2016 was the year we were introduced to the Zika virus. Thus far, the media spin on Zika has focused on its impact in the Caribbean, Central America, South America and Florida. It has also been categorized as a disease that the general populous shouldn't worry much about unless you're a female who's looking to get pregnant. However, mainstream media has largely ignored recent discoveries about the disease and it's beginning to spread to other tourism-heavy countries throughout the world. While the short-term impact to tourism has been largely downplayed, we believe over the long term, it has the potential to make certain regions of the world virtually off-limits for tourism. The impact to travel and tourism is further exacerbated by the fact that regions affected tend to be warm, tropical climates best suited for vacations.We found an article in the Orlando Sentinel with quotes from Seth Forman, general manager of destinations at TZOO. In regards to Zika, Mr. Forman claims that although travelers have concern and anxiety regarding Zika, they are still committed to traveling to affected destinations like Florida. According to TZOO's survey, in February, 30% of American Travelzoo users said it would be a factor in their travel decision. That figure increased to 40% last month. Forman also said that Zika hasn't impacted international travel decisions much. We believe that could change in a major way.As we're exiting the mosquito season, Zika concerns in the US are moving to the back burner but in other parts of the world, Zika is just getting started. Recently, Asia and Africa have become areas of concern for a major Zika outbreak, and many of these countries are ill-prepared to handle an outbreak. Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand have all experienced recent outbreaks and other countries including India, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Nigeria, Vietnam, Pakistan and Bangladesh all contain the humid tropical elements Zika mosquitoes typically thrive in. Singapore has confirmed at least 341 cases of Zika since August 27th and Thailand announced at least 200 infections with many more likely unreported. China, the UK, Australia, Taiwan, South Korea and the US have all recently issued travel warnings for Singapore.While the outbreaks are of concern, if the infection only impacts expectant mothers then it likely won't meaningfully slow the travel industry. Increasingly, there is evidence that Zika may harm infected adults with long-term consequences. Unfortunately, when it comes to Zika, the best science can tell us for now is that they just don't know. At first, they said it was only transmitted by a mosquito bite, then they found it could possibly be transmitted via intercourse. Now there is speculation it could be transmitted by saliva, tears or other bodily fluids.What we find most disturbing, and what we think would be a game changer for the travel industry, is that there is some evidence that Zika can have a neurological impact on full-grown adults. In one recent case, a woman exhibited damaged memory after contracting Zika. Some of the effects have been described as similar to Alzheimer's and Multiple Sclerosis. There's growing concern that Zika actually may slowly destroy the brain's stem cells, cells responsible for developing neurons critical for learning and memory and the long-term impact for those infected simply is an unknown. It is still early and the implications, if true, would extend far beyond TZOO, but the impact of Zika, in combination with terrorism concerns, present potentially major near-term hurdles for a small company already in decline.The Balance Sheet Isn't As Strong As It Looks:One of the strengths of TZOO is its cash position of $27.6mil with no debt. We note that while this is strong, it's not as strong as it had been prior to the APAC acquisition. APAC remains a cash burn for the company and the acquisition drew down its cash balance by about $26mil. So the balance sheet strength has deteriorated. We also note that the majority of the cash, $16.2mil, is held outside the US. This cash is not accessible to US shareholders unless the cash is repatriated at the corporate tax rate of 35%. Tax affecting the cash held outside the US results in a meaningfully smaller cash balance of $21.9mil vs. the publicly reported $27.6mil.Additionally, we discovered in TZOO's SEC filings that it has been under an IRS audit for the past few years regarding the sale of the APAC unit. The IRS has issued a Revenue Agent's Report (RAR) to TZOO concluding the company owes back taxes and federal penalties of $31mil excluding possible additional interest and state penalties. The IRS audit conclusion is based on its view that the APAC business that was sold to Ralph Bartel's Azzurro Capital had a significantly higher valuation then the proceeds the company received upon the sale. It appears that the IRS agrees with our assessment that the sale of the APAC division to Azzurro Capital doesn't pass the sniff test.To date, TZOO has not taken a reserve for this amount. It plans to fight this decision and will take the IRS to court if necessary. Not only is this scenario a distraction for the company, which could impact operations, it also adds to expenses. If TZOO exhausts all appeal options and ultimately has to pay $31mil in back taxes, it will have more than depleted all its cash reserves if paid in full. We argue this puts TZOO in an extremely precarious situation given the company is struggling to stem the tide of declining revenue with no imminent signs of improvement on the horizon.Valuation:TZOO's earnings have improved in the past two quarters strictly due to staff reductions. We see no signs of a turn in revenue despite increased spend on member acquisitions that began in Q3 of 2014. The company has been rolling out a hotel bookings platform now for over two years and appears to still be having difficulty with the transition. We believe this is directly the result of the intensely competitive nature of the booking industry where it has little to no background or technological advantages. The transition to mobile is crushing its advertising revenue and increasingly as the company shrinks it is becoming less relevant.Currently, it is entering the seasonally weakest time of the year. In the first half, it was able to improve earnings over 2015 solely on cost cuts. We anticipate the second half will be better than the second half of last year but not as strong as the first half of this year. We are modeling for 10c in EPS for the 3rd quarter followed by 6c in EPS for the fourth quarter consistent with seasonal trends. That brings full year EPS to 44c. With the stock around $13 per share, the company is currently trading at nearly 30x 2016 earnings. We believe this is extremely overvalued for a dying business in the early stages of the largest operational transition in its history.In 2017, we're anticipating the company will continue to attempt further staff reductions but to a lesser degree as much excess will have been wrung out of the system. At the same time, we expect investment in APAC to ramp meaningfully, specifically for member acquisition. The company has alluded to this in its recent investor calls. It likely needs to invest further in the hotel booking platform as well. Declining revenue in its core North American business, which represents 63% of revenue, is likely to continue weighing heavily on its ability to maintain long-term profitability. With 2017 looking like a year of slack revenue with increasing costs driven by APAC, we're forecasting EPS to decline vs. 2016. We're currently modeling for 33c in EPS for 2017.We believe this is the most dangerous time to be an investor in TZOO in its history. The business is in decline and the future of the company relies on making significant progress in the hotel bookings portion of its business. The stock has already made a major bounce purely on cost cuts so the risk now is to the downside on failure to execute a transition to revenue growth. For the several reasons mentioned above and based on management's own comments, the chances of successfully transitioning the business is very low in our opinion. Therefore, we feel a 20x multiple on 2017 earnings is more than generous. Our 12-month target price for TZOO is $6.60 per share representing downside of approximately 50%.If TZOO is unable to reverse what we estimate is a negative ROI on new members, we question its survivability as a business entity. In this scenario, downside would be closer to zero.Conclusion:The recent increase in TZOO shares has been driven by higher EPS for the past two quarters of 28c and represents a solid improvement over the 11c in the first half of last year. Unfortunately, the entire improvement has been based on cost cuts almost entirely from staff reductions. Fundamentals continue to worsen with revenue remaining in a long-term decline. The company is currently in the early phases of an attempt to transition the business increasingly away from advertising into hotel bookings. Hotel bookings are not an area where it has experience and as we've described, competition in the space is fierce. For two years now, it has tried to roll out the hotel platform but to-date has had little success. We believe its transition to hotel bookings will ultimately fail due to several reasons.The local deals (vouchers) part of its business continues to decline due to competitive pressure and a change in consumer habits from a ""push"" to ""pull,"" or purchase at time of use, mentality. These pressures are unlikely to subside.In search, the company appears willing to allow this portion of its business to die on the vine. It has substantially reduced investment in the division and as a result, traffic trends continue to decline for fly.com and SuperSearch. Again, competitive pressures appear to be the culprit for the decline. We see no reason for a reversal in this trend.We do not believe TZOO has been able to achieve the ""critical mass"" in travel, local or search necessary for long-term survival. Despite the fact that the Internet advertising industry is consistently growing about 10% per year, TZOO's revenue has been in decline since 2013. Mobile is now approaching 50% of digital ad spend and over time, this is likely to grow. TZOO has found mobile difficult to monetize due to lower click-through and conversion rates on mobile vs. desktop. This trend will continue to negatively impact its business.As one of the earliest adopters to Internet advertising, TZOO has had plenty of opportunity to capitalize on the shift to digital. For several years, it was able to ride the tailcoats of this shift but the days of easy growth are over. As technology has advanced, TZOO hasn't reinvested enough to stay ahead of the competition. Like Kodak or Sears (NASDAQ:SHLD), we believe that TZOO became too comfortable in its niche and hasn't stayed ahead of the curve. History is riddled with examples of companies that failed to anticipate a changing marketplace. In most cases, by the time, they figure it out and try to ""play catch-up"", it's too late. This accurately describes TZOO's current situation.While members continue to grow, revenue per member is consistently down while cost per new member continues higher. Additionally, when accounting for churn the acquisition cost of new members is far higher than reported by the company. Long term, these trends are unsustainable. The company claims it is acquiring higher quality members to justify the cost but there is no evidence of this in the financials. We believe there is no reasonable basis to assume it can make money on the members it is now acquiring, resulting in a negative ROI. It is also being impacted by issues like terrorism and we feel Zika could present a bigger issue for TZOO than is currently assumed.In our opinion, the company is not shareholder-friendly due to the fact that the founder owns over 50% of the company. This has led to a lack of innovation and questionable financial arrangements. There is no opportunity for shareholder activism to improve operations at TZOO.Currently trading near 30x our 2016 EPS estimate, we believe the company is substantially overvalued. Based on our expectation for increasing costs on declining revenue, we expect EPS to decline to 33c in 2017. We have a $6.60 target on shares of TZOO and see 50% downside to the current share price over the next year."

It's a thought that echoes Howard Marks: investing can often be a negative art, whereby crossing out ideas that aren't truly great risk-rewards, you're one step closer to outperformance.I bring this up because it epitomizes how I feel about a stock like Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO). On the basis of value to potential - i.e., how much the company could be worth under the right circumstances, versus how much it trades for now - it looks quite attractive. And yet that has been the case for multiple years: I've seen bull cases written up at $20, and $14, and $10, and so on, and clearly they haven't worked out.Is it merely an issue of timing and patience or something more structural? I'm inclined to believe the latter. I believe that in the context of recent results and commentary from the online travel agencies, Travelzoo's strategic decisions - and its financial results - are quite puzzling. Throw in last year's Asia transaction having at least the optical appearance of potential self-dealing, and this is a stock I think investors would do well to avoid even though you can model scenarios where it's worth substantially more than its current trading price of ~$8.25.Why Buy Them When You Can Beat Them?One of the perpetual bullish angles on Travelzoo has been its seeming attractiveness as a buyout asset: it's one of the few remaining independent online travel properties, and it received attention at a much higher price (north of $20/share). Indeed, it's not like the OTAs have been shy about shelling out capital for deals over the past couple years:Source: Bloomberg IntelligenceYet with this flurry of dealmaking in the rearview mirror, Travelzoo remains independent despite its seemingly digestible size. And the OTAs seem to be sated: at the Bank of America conference a few weeks ago, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) CFO Mark Okerstrom noted that:In terms of opportunism, I imagine that Expedia and Priceline (PCLN) would be looking more for neat technology or market channels than a company that has never been considered a technology leader (a trend which continues, as I'll discuss in a moment). Indeed, both of these companies are capable of delivering double-digit organic growth; taking out Travelzoo would add less than 2% to their revenues:They could likely still deliver good financial returns if they purchased TZOO at the right price, as they would be able to materially reduce customer acquisition costs (thanks to scale) and basically fire the entire engineering team. Still, it seems like a ""why bother"" kind of scenario - the returns aren't going to move the needle, and deals of that size are usually done for strategic rather than financial reasons. Travelzoo would not be a strategic deal.Winner-Take-All Dynamics Playing Out?One of the particularly concerning issues here is that Travelzoo is continually unable to generate growth in an environment that would seem to be favorable. Despite their massive scale, the OTAs continue to generate robust organic growth as the offline-to-online conversion continues. None of this is flowing through to much smaller Travelzoo:Source: Travelzoo Investor DeckEven if you net out Travelzoo's intentional shedding of unprofitable business - and more on that in a second - it still isn't generating anything close to the organic growth rate of its much larger peers. This leads me to question whether there's a winner-take-all dynamic at play here: in other articles, I've discussed how this dynamic is playing out in e-commerce retail, and the same phenomenon may be ongoing here, as consumers increasingly go direct to the most recognizable brands (which are the marketplaces with the greatest liquidity, a la Uber (NYSE:UBER)). Google Trends data should be taken with a grain of salt thanks to the increasingly diverse ways (including apps) in which consumers interact with content, but Travelzoo has seen a much greater decline over the past few years than Priceline or Expedia:Interest over time in ""travelzoo."" Source: Google TrendsSpeaking of apps, one of the issues here may be Travelzoo's historical status as a technology laggard. On the Q1 call (transcript here on Seeking Alpha), CEO Holger Bartel noted that the company has been ""working to enhance our products to be more mobile-friendly and to enhance usability so that members can more easily find what they're looking for.""Becoming mobile-friendly in 2016 is like showing up to the party at 10 AM - everyone left a long, long time ago. Expedia spent a great deal of time at its Investor Day a few months ago talking about mobile, and it has driven pretty impressive statistics here:Source: Expedia investor presentation, March 2016.Here's the challenging part: Expedia and Priceline are both putting a lot of effort behind driving traffic in-app rather than via mobile web, which will likely make it a lot stickier.What's going to change this? The hotel initiative which Travelzoo is putting a lot of muscle behind clearly isn't delivering anything visible to the consolidated financials yet, and trying to build a de novo hotel bookings platform looks, quite frankly, like a non-starter. On top of the existing scale, brand recognition, and hotel relationships that the leaders already have, some hotel chains (such as Hilton) are making noise about trying to increase their direct sales to avoid paying OTAs commissions.I would not consider myself an expert on the dynamics of this industry, but reading between the lines, Expedia and Priceline may be willing to ""invest"" something into price to obviate this risk (which seems like a driver of recent consolidation: see Starwood-Marriott, etc.). Indeed, Expedia CFO Mark Okerstrom noted at the recent Goldman conference that ""we're not solving for EBITDA margin expansion."" This followed on comments at Investor Day along the same lines:With a lagging technology platform, a lack of scale, and hotels finally standing up to the OTAs' take rates, the outlook for Travelzoo's hotel ambitions does not look good - and clearly the ""legacy"" offerings aren't performing so hot either.Will The Real Unit Economics Please Stand Up?Perhaps the most frustrating part of the Travelzoo story is its inability to generate either meaningful constant-currency revenue growth or profitability. Despite shedding unprofitable business, Travelzoo still sees its operating income declining, and it's very difficult for me to reconcile this with a company that isn't growing meaningfully (and in fact looks to be flat or shrinking even outside of intentional revenue trimming).Why a company of Travelzoo's size has empty-calorie revenue is a good question to begin with, but the margins on the remaining revenue simply don't look good. Expedia and Priceline both generate materially higher margins while delivering substantial growth:Now consider that Travelzoo appears to be looking to invest more rather than less - with slim hopes of achieving the same kind of revenue growth in the near term, if the industry outlook for its hotel initiative and recent results of its legacy business are any indication. This leads me to question whether its unit economics have degraded materially, because something's not adding up.Valuation: It Could Be Worth A Lot More… But Probably NotWhile the bull case for Travelzoo has always relied on the fact that OTAs (either in deals or on their own) trade at substantial premiums to Travelzoo's paltry revenue multiple, I think a better comparison at this point might actually be perpetually underperforming deals site Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN):Despite being in the travel vertical, the divergence of Travelzoo's results from the OTAs suggests that its deal-focused business model is not as comparable as once thought.The M&A case looks dead in the water, and upside will have to come from better margins as a standalone - indeed, if Travelzoo could post even low double-digit margins while modestly growing revenues, it could easily be worth double what it's trading for today. Unfortunately, this would likely require a material improvement in its unit economics - even though the company has been shedding unprofitable business and focusing on improving resource productivity, it's just not translating to the P&L in any way I consider meaningful.Finally, there's the governance risk here, highlighted by last year's decision to purchase the Asia subsidiary from controlling shareholder Azzurro Capital for $22.6 million. Recall that Travelzoo sold this business to Azzurro for $3.6 million in 2009. Considering that Azzurro Capital's beneficial owner is company co-founder Ralph Bartel - the brother of Chairman/CEO Holger Bartel - it certainly has at least the appearance of major self-dealing.While the valuation was determined by an independent third party - Stout Risius Ross - as a ""fair market value,"" my experience from reading merger proxies as well as once doing the grunt work on my previous fund's retainer of a valuation firm is that these kinds of determinations are extremely subjective. Relative to other potential uses of capital - buying back shares, for example - it looks like an expensive deal at well over 2x LTM revenues. The Asia-Pacific segment still seems likely to lose money for some time, and unless it grows materially faster than it's growing today, it's hard to see where value creation comes from (as the business is basically just burning capital without scaling).Final ThoughtsI am, generally, a fan of small-cap technology platforms - but while there are several I own that I find to be dramatically underrated relative to their historical execution and future potential, I simply can't say that's the case for Travelzoo. It is a very distant also-ran to the OTAs, and recent results suggest its historical underinvestment in technology and lack of scale put it at a material unit-economic disadvantage relative to its larger peers. With a buyout looking pretty unlikely at this point, upside will have to come from better results as a standalone - something I wouldn't hold out for. Even if things go well, governance here has to be considered a big question mark after the Asia transaction.All in all, then, Travelzoo looks like a classic value trap: seemingly lots of potential that's always just around the corner… but never exploited. Looking at competitors and industry dynamics, there appear to be external, existential factors driving Travelzoo's persistent underperformance, and at this point, I don't think even better management could really turn this business around in a way likely to generate material upside for shareholders.Disclaimer: Investing is inherently subjective and this article expresses opinions.

4168481,21815,2018-05-02T10:27:49-04:00,"The shares of travel membership organization Travelzoo went parabolic, and with good reason even if the shares are heavily overbought.Although revenue growth was fairly modest, there was a big rise in operational performance, boosted further by a higher euro.Their core markets provide cash which the company can invest to spur growth in Asia, and if they can continue to do, this the party isn't over.","The parabolic rise in the shares of Travelzoo (TZOO), the travel membership site, caught our attention:That's certainly a heck of a chart, suggesting a dramatic improvement of fortunes. Investors are certainly buoyant, the RSI reached 94, a level one rarely sees.At first sight, the improvement isn't really due to spectacular revenue growth. As it happens, there is a mild 9% bounce from the previous downward trend:TZOO Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsBut this is good to see anyway, as these can be inflection points that have the potential to propel considerable operational improvement. And operational improvements certainly occurred (from the earning slides):The EPS beat was certainly huge, only $0.08 was expected while the company delivered $0.20. The turnaround was helped by the rise of the euro and comes entirely from the company's mature markets:As you can see, Asia is a considerable drag on earnings, mostly because operations lack scale and investments need to be substantial in order to achieve that.We think part of the improvement is simply the synchronized growth in the world economy, lifting tourism in the process. This is certainly visible in Europe, for instance.Management isn't without ambitions (Q1CC):So what are they doing to realize these, well:The first growth initiatives look like a win-win (Q1CC):We like how the company is positioned in a crowded field. What they offer members are experiences, not just destinations or hotels. These are slightly off the beaten path (although one could argue the world travel industry is so huge, most paths are already quite beaten).It's not just Italy, but cooking lessons in Italy, or surfing in Hawaii, or a river cruise in Europe.They are in the midst of building a new bookings platform for hotel offerings as well as these package offerings. It will be ready by the end of the year.AsiaManagement argues that this is increasingly relevant in the biggest outbound market in tourism, China. Demand is broadening beyond the obvious tourism hotspots for Chinese (New York, Paris, Venice, etc.) and this plays into the hands of Travelzoo (Q1CC):We are also covering the Chinese travel giant Ctrip (CTRP), but Travelzoo is a small niche player especially in Asia, so while that competition is formidable, we think there is room for Travelzoo to grow.But it should do so on the basis of a specific niche, like exotic destinations or specific packages, to get more traction, in our view. Of course, they do just that, but one should not underestimate the amount of sophistication of a big platform like Ctrip.The tiny size of the company in Asia is both a benefit and a disadvantage. A benefit because they can sail under the radar for quite some time, but on the other hand, they lack scale which brings all kinds of benefits online, like economies of scale, scope and network economies (more eyeballs bring more packages, bringing more eyeballs, advertisers, etc.).Some of that is already present in their core markets and we think it's possible the company will reach that state in Asia (their core markets actually help as resources are shared to a considerable degree), but this is a fairly long road and not a given.Revenues are growing in Asia (12% in the quarter), so there is evidence that they're making progress.Here is what management said during the Q1CC:In fact, management is looking to grow revenues even faster in the second-half of 2018 and the years beyond (Q1CC):Since revenues aren't growing all that much, the big beat on earnings has to come from operational improvements, and indeed:It's clear that while operational costs are falling relative to revenue in the core markets, investments in Asia, where revenues are still very small, take a toll.Here is another view, note the substantial improvement in revenues per employee if Asia is left out of the picture:TZOO Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThe company has no debt and exited the quarter with $22.4M of cash on its books. Apart from what seems to be a one-off, the company doesn't have a history of dilution:T Shares Outstanding data by YChartsTZOO PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsValuation has shot up, and on a backwards GAAP basis, the earnings multiple is, of course, very substantial. Analysts expect an EPS of $0.23 this year rising to $0.30 in 2019, but these will, of course, be revised upwards rather substantially in the next coming days, as the company achieved $0.20 just in Q1 alone and this wasn't a freak result (apart from some currency tailwind).Even if they can just keep these earnings, the shares are still cheap; there is little wonder that the stock price went parabolic.The rally has already reached parabolic territory but that seems to be justified by events on the ground. The shares are cheap even in case there isn't much further earnings growth.If they can keep on growing in their core markets and further enhance leverage and invest the money productively in Asia to reach sufficient scale, both seem attainable goals, then substantially higher prices are eminently possible, in our view.A slowing economy and currency movements (a fall in the euro) could slow progress."
4233276,21228,2019-01-14T13:57:13-05:00,Travelzoo started rolling out a change to its hotel booking platform in Europe that shows prices for both hotels and flights.The company has issued a couple of press releases that details how this change has been met favorably and led to increased sales.The company plans to rollout the change in North America early this year.The company said they expect significant year-over-year increase in profitability in the coming quarter. I expect growth in future quarters as well as this change is fully rolled out.,"Travelzoo (TZOO) is a travel website that offers hotels deals, vacation deals, and local entertainment packages via its website. The company has been in business since 1998 and has 19.8 million subscribers. The company is probably best known for its Top 20 Deals which are the 20 best travel deals the company can find from more than 2,000 companies worldwide. These deals are sent out weekly via email to the company’s subscribers and are also shown on the company’s website.Travelzoo’s revenue has been declining over the last few years but the company started to grow revenue again in 2018 and the company is currently implementing changes to its website that should accelerate growth further. Travelzoo’s stock has a low float and a history of astronomical gains so if growth is accelerated the stock price should rise in tandem.Travelzoo sells deals in a variety of ways. Some deals are advertising deals where a company pays Travelzoo to include the deal on their website. If a customer clicks on the deal they will be taken to the other company’s website to purchase the deal. Some deals are offered as vouchers where a customer buys the voucher and has to redeem it later. Travelzoo has also been working on a hotel booking platform that allows users to book the hotel directly through Travelzoo’s website. This last option has recently received an upgrade.In September of 2018 Travelzoo launched a change to their hotel booking platform in Germany. Previously when a customer wanted to book a hotel deal they had to buy their plane flight via some other means. Now after selecting a hotel deal they are offered a combined price for hotels and flights. In addition, extra information such as airport transfers, insurance, and car rentals is provided.It seems intuitive that this change will lead to an increase in sales because the customer does not have to go through the hassle of finding another means to get a flight. Since the customer has all the information they need they will be more likely to go ahead and purchase the deal. This was confirmed by Travelzoo in their press release when they said that “members that were shown the calendar with flight information made five times as many bookings as members that were given just a hotel-only deal.”In October the company announced the technology had been rolled out in the U.K., Spain, and France and mentioned some further positive comments. The company mentioned the German market achieved a record high of more than 500 rooms booked within 48 hours for one hotel and the traffic and revenue to one Parisian hotel from German members had been 3 times higher in just one week. They also mentioned the average length of hotel stays had increased from 1.8 room nights to 3.7. These could be some cherry picked examples but it seems the rollout of the new technology in Europe is going well.Also, Travelzoo recently announced they are opening a sales office in Italy and mentioned in the press release that “for the current fourth quarter the company expects to report a significant year-over-year increase in profitability”. I think it is reasonable to assume the new technology rollout in Europe helped lead to the increase in profitability in the coming quarter.This technology has not been rolled out in North America or Asia Pacific yet but the CEO mentioned in the Q3 18 earnings call that it would be rolled out “in North America at the beginning” of 2019. The rollout in North America should be an additional catalyst since most of Travelzoo’s revenue, 60%, comes from North America.The stock price of Travelzoo had a pretty volatile year in 2018. From the start of 2018 through April of 2018 the stock price of Travelzoo bottomed out and found support in the $6 - $7 range. Then Q1 18 results were announced and the stock price shot up. The company reported revenue and earnings growth. However, what really got investors excited was in the Q1 18 earnings call the CEO mentioned the new technology rollout and the desire “to accelerate top line growth and at least double the size of the company in the next few years”. Investors cheered this information and sent the stock price over $21 by July.However, the new technology was not implemented in Q2 18 and Q3 18. While those quarters showed revenue growth, the marginal growth did not merit the huge increase in stock price. The stock price ended up making a round trip back to the $7 range by the end of 2018.The stock price has already started to trend back up in anticipation of Q4 18 earnings and currently trades near $11. At that price Travelzoo’s market cap is around $140 million which equates to a 1.3 price to sale ratio for the trailing twelve months. This is low compared to the biggest travel website company Booking Holdings (BKNG) which has a price to sales ratio of 5.5 according to Yahoo! Finance. This obviously isn’t a fair comparison since Booking Holdings owns the biggest travel websites (Priceline.com, Booking.com, Kayak.com, etc.) and has shown strong growth for years. However, the gap in valuations shows Travelzoo can trade at a much higher multiple if growth is achieved. Last year the market quickly sent Travelzoo’s stock price above $20, which equated to a price to sale ratio above 2, in anticipation of growth. I think it is reasonable to assume the valuation can return to that price in the next couple of quarters if it is confirmed that the technology rollout is going to accelerate growth.Seeking Alpha contributor Truth & Value also wrote a blog post on Travelzoo’s valuation if you want more information.Another thing to note is the stock price of Travelzoo made runs to over $100 in 2004 and 2011. The stock has an extremely low float so if the financials really start to improve then investor demand may drive the stock price a lot higher than a typical stock.Basically my bullish thesis is the new technology rollout is going to lead to revenue growth and earnings growth in future quarters. This should be become more apparent when Q4 18 results are announced in early February. Since the company has already announced they expect to “report a significant year-over-year increase in profitability” the stock price has already started to trend up. If the company disappoints and the results don’t show the technology is going to drive growth the stock price may drop back down to the previous support level in the $7 dollar range.Another concern is the macro environment. Even if the technology rollout does lead to growth there may be concerns about a recession or there may be a weak overall stock market that could put a damper on future stock gains. If the economy does enter a recession this will obviously make an impact on people’s decision to travel. Travelers may become more conservative and travel less which would affect travel websites. However, I don’t anticipate a recession to happen in the next few quarters and I think this is the time frame that Travelzoo may see significant gains. The coming quarter should show improved results based on the technology rollout in Europe. The following quarter or two should show further growth depending on when the rollout in North America happens. The macro environment is something to consider however.Also, as I have previously noted Travelzoo is a low float micro-cap stock that can experience a lot of volatility in its stock price. This stock can make both large gains and large losses very fast.For other risk factors please refer to the risk section in one of the company’s 10-Ks or 10-Qs.Travelzoo has started to implement a new technology to their hotel booking platform that allows users to see both hotel and flight information. This technology has been rolled out to Travelzoo’s European customers this past quarter and has been met with a very favorable response. I anticipate the company’s financials to improve starting this quarter and continue to improve in future quarters as the rollout is implemented in North America and Asia Pacific. The stock price is already starting to trend up in anticipation of next quarter's results but the stock price is still trading at a low valuation and I think now is a good time to buy. If growth is confirmed, the stock price should rise in tandem.Please do your own due diligence and make your own decisions for buying and selling this stock."

At these levels, TZOO is attractively valued.TZOO is trading at a 10.07x trailing earnings, which means the company has a 9.93% earnings yield. This is markedly higher than the 10-year Treasury yield of 2.35%, which gives investors a nice equity-specific risk premium. Moreover, the S&P 500 earnings yield is 4.83%, which affirms that TZOO's 9.93% earnings yield is attractive. By comparison, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) have earnings yields of 3.10% and 1.62%, respectively. Despite EXPE and TRIP being better positioned for growth in this space, this disparity in yields is too alarming to not make TZOO the more attractive value investment.Moreover, TZOO trades at 1.03x trailing sales, while EXPE and TRIP trade at 2.37x and 10x trailing sales, respectively.TZOO also has a strong financial standing with $55.9 million in cash and no debt. The company generated FCF of $2 million so far this year, which is markedly better than last year due to constrained capital expenditures and healthier operating cash flow.Our DCF model yields a fair value $13 for TZOO, which is informed by both bearish and bullish assumptions. We conservatively assume free cash flow is flat YoY through the remainder of 2015, which is bearish considering FCF has grown healthily in the first half of 2015. We then assume OCF can grow to 2013 levels of $16-17 million due to growing profit margin and a return to more efficient handling of working capital. We also assume capex grows as the company continues to expand its user base and platform.We employ a 2% perpetuity rate and a 7.73% CAPM discount rate (where the equity risk premium was calculated as the difference between S&P 500 earnings yield and 10-year Treasury yield), and arrive at a fair value of $13.TZOO isn't a compelling investment because the company's growth looks limited. But the stock is attractively valued and a value correction could offer solid upside here."
3552166,23479,2015-10-05T17:33:54-04:00,The company might be embarking on a change in its leadership in order to better follow its new strategies.CEO Chris Loughlin resigned recently and chairman Holger Bartel will assume the position.Other management changes were announced by the company.,"Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) has announced a few changes in its top level management. The most important change is the appointment of Holger Bartel as the global CEO of the company. Holger, who is the brother of Travelzoo's founder Ralph Bartel, will assume this newly created position in 2016. Post its weak performance in 2014, Travelzoo is finally making a gradual recovery. In 2015, its refurbished hotel booking platform witnessed improved demand and Travelzoo reacquired its Asia-Pacific business recently to expand the reach of the hotel platform. Travelzoo appointed Vivian Young as the president of its Asia Pacific business, effective January 1, 2016. In its local deals division, Travelzoo is trying to introduce more demand-based live deals and phase-out its rigid voucher format. Along with all these changes the company might be embarking on a change in its leadership in order to better follow its new strategies.Travelzoo Will Get A Global CEO In 2016Travelzoo's CEO Chris Loughlin resigned recently and its chairman Holger Bartel will assume the position of the global CEO, effective January 1, 2016. Holger Bartel had been the CEO of Travelzoo between 2008 and 2010. Loughlin had been associated with Travelzoo in various positions since 2001 and had assumed the role of Travelzoo's CEO since July 2010. [1]Possible Reasons For The CEO ChangeOther Changes In ManagementOther management changes were announced by the company, as well. Mike Stitt had been announced president of Travelzoo North America, effective immediately. Until recently, Stitt oversaw Travelzoo's entertainment and local deals along with its publishing and product planning.Vivian Hong, who currently heads operations in Travelzoo China, Hong Kong and Taiwan will be the president of Travelzoo Asia Pacific, effective January 1, 2016. Hence, along with the aforementioned regions, Australia, Japan and Southeast Asia will be added to Hong's set of responsibilities. Travelzoo's newly reacquired Asia Pacific business would require an operational head and we believe this was a logical step by the company.Recent Changes In Travelzoo's FocusTravel: The Company Is Finally Gaining Customers For The New PlatformTravelzoo's hotel booking platform allows travelers to book full-priced hotels and hence Travelzoo is slowly gaining the stature of a regular OTA, thus evolving from being solely a seller of discounted travel and entertainment deals. The platform received a lukewarm response in 2014, but the company made a fresh attempt to relaunch the hotel booking platform at the end of February 2015, with newer content pertaining to six destinations including New York, Las Vegas and Chicago. [3] Travelzoo finally started gaining traction, post these new initiatives. The hotel search, and searching for deals for specific dates, have witnessed significant growth on the platform. The company will attempt to roll out the hotel platform on a global scale in the near future.Search: Increased Monetization Of Search Traffic Has Been Observed, LatelyTravelzoo's search division performed poorly in 2014 on account of intense competition in this field and the company's delay in investing in the search segment. Search revenue declined by 25% year-on-year to ~$18 million in 2014. [4] [5]However, in 2015, Search has finally started picking up. For the first half of 2015, revenues in the search segment increased by around 2% to almost $9.5 million. [6] The management had increased spend on Search products, i.e. SuperSearch and Fly.com, post the performance improvement in Q1 2015. The company is currently observing better monetization of its Search traffic.In August, Travelzoo added Beatrice Tarka, the CEO and founder of travel search engine platform, Mobissimo, onto its board of directors. [7] Though Travelzoo refused to draw any connection between Travelzoo and Mobissimo's relationship due to this inclusion, there might be a possibility that Travelzoo is looking for the further bolstering of its Search segment.Disclosure: No positions."

The Street is looking for $33.8 million in revenue for the quarter, and we believe this figure is too bullish. We are modeling for $32.2 million based on our revenue-per-subscriber, or RPS, analysis.In Q1FY15, the company's Travel and Local segments declined 9% YoY and 18.8% YoY, respectively, while the Search segment grew revenues 5.7% YoY.

We feel that these trends coupled with a competitive landscape do not bode well for a revenue turnaround in the near future for TZOO.Contributing to our bearish sentiment is TZOO's outdated ""push"" model, which bears closer resemblance to a Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) business model than an EXPE business model. Historically, TZOO found much success in inspiring consumers to take trips and travel when they had not already planned to do so. Recent trends in the online travel industry suggest that most platforms are shifting (and have already shifted, in many cases) to a ""pull"" marketing model that allows consumers to search for specific travel arrangements. TZOO lags in this transition as it finds itself somewhere in a confusing overlap between EXPE-like services offered through a GRPN-like business model.TZOO is expecting a shift from existing hotel revenue to commission based revenue as the company expands its hotel-booking platform to accommodate a ""push"" model. This shift could result in lower revenue if the volume of hotel bookings decreases. Therefore, it is essential to the company's revenues that TZOO can continue to attract travelers and traffic to the site. The cost to acquire new members, however, has increased 60% YoY to $2.66 per user MRQ, while RPS (defined as annualized revenue divided by subscribers at the beginning of the year) has decreased 15.78% MRQ.We can see that RPS has suffered recently, noting that with an exception to 2012, Q2 RPS suffers more (or benefits less) than Q1 RPS, in terms of YoY change.We can assume that RPS YoY growth in Q2 will be equal to or less than -15.78%. Analysts, however, are modeling for $33.8 million in revenue, which annualized equates to $135.2 million. At the beginning of the year, TZOO has 24.2 million subs according to SEC filings, so $33.8 million in revenue implies Q2 RPS of $5.59. This would be a 11.6% YoY decrease in RPS, markedly less than Q1's -15.78% YoY decrease.We do not believe this is possible considering these facts:We are therefore modeling for RPS to decrease 15.78% YoY in Q2, which leads us to a forecasted revenue of $32.2 million, roughly $1.6 million short of analyst estimates."

The company has a large member base, with 27.7 million members, 9 million unique visitors each month, and a mobile app that has been downloaded 3.4 million times.Travelzoo makes money by acting as a medium for other travel and local companies to advertise products to its members. After scorching growth from 2008 to 2011, Travelzoo's growth has leveled off. Although Travelzoo's total number of members increased from 25.5 million in 2012 to 27.6 million in 2014, the company's revenue per member decreased from $7.04 in 2012 to $6.10 in 2014. Because of the fall in revenue per member, Travelzoo revenue decreased from $151 million in 2012 to $142 million in 2014. Margins have not improved, with operating margin declining from 20.8% in 2010 to 16.9% in 2012, 14.8% in 2014, and 12.9% in the trailing twelve months. Because of the fall in growth and margins, Travelzoo stock has fallen significantly from its 2011 highs.The macro climate for Travelzoo is mixed. On one hand, the U.S. economy is very strong, with the unemployment rate at the lowest level since 2008. Because the unemployment rate is low, more people are willing to make the highly discretionary decision to travel to new places. Because the U.S. dollar is strong, taking vacations outside the U.S. also is cheaper. Because Americans travel more, Travelzoo's North American unit will generate strong revenues over the next few quarters. On the other hand, Europe's economy is weak. Given that Europe made up 33% of Travelzoo revenues in 2014, a weak European economy means slower growth for Travelzoo overall. Moreover, the strong dollar is a headwind for Travelzoo Europe, as it reduces the division's revenue in dollar terms. Because of the mixed macro picture, analysts don't see much upside in Travelzoo's future. They have a consensus target of $11.88 per share.Like the macro picture, hedge funds are divided on Travelzoo. Five of the top six hedge fund holders of Travelzoo increased their positions in the first quarter. Osmium Partners increased its position by 21% to 834,227 shares while Renaissance Technologies increased its position by 59% to 103,800 shares. Pdt Partners increased its position by 11% to 61,067 shares and Two Sigma Advisors increased its position by 50% to 32,635 shares. Nine Chapters Capital Management increased its position by 165% to 31,500 shares. The other top six holder, Peak6 Capital Management, established a new position of 77,466 shares, but also bought $96,000 worth of puts. Meanwhile, Travelzoo's other five hedge fund owners either decreased their position or completely sold off their position in the first quarter. Millennium Management, D E Shaw and Citadel Investment Group decreased their position while Springbok Capital and Tigershark Partners sold off their position.Following the activity of hedge funds is important because our research shows that the 15 most popular small-cap stocks among hedge funds have outperformed the market by nearly a percentage point per month between 1999 and 2012. Travelzoo has potential, but the company needs to increase margins or growth for the stock to be a buy. At its current price, Travelzoo trades at a forward PE of 37.45, a valuation that's high compared to the S&P 500's forward PE of 18 or Expedia's (NASDAQ:EXPE) forward PE of 20.84. Travelzoo would be better off by selling itself or merging with another travel company to increase margins and to deliver value to shareholders."

Travelzoo's platform provides travel, entertainment and local deals from thousands of companies. The company has been under-performing in its Search and Local deals division for the last two years. The Search division has been lagging behind due to intense competition in the segment. The Local Deals division, which is mostly conducted through a voucher program, is facing waning demand due to the complex and inflexible process in place to book and redeem them.To address these issues, the company increased product and marketing related investments and re-positioned itself to better face changing market demands. The company developed a new hotel booking website (which is currently in the beta version) and re-positioned itself from a discount offer dealer to selling packages based on client needs. It is reducing its focus on the Search segment while still maintaining the division.Travelzoo's highlight for 2014 was the introduction of a new hotel booking platform, which it believed will revive its position in the industry. The platform failed to generate expected demand last year. Travelzoo is confident about reviving demand in the platform by modifying its features based on users' feedback. However, in the event that the booking platform fails to generate sufficient traction, there could be a significant downside to Travelzoo's valuation.Additionally, Travelzoo's formidable competitors in the online travel space, such as Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), are posing an additional threat to the company's future. Both of the behemoths are on an acquisition and consolidation spree. With rising competition, Travelzoo's pricing power and its ability to attract suppliers and users can be further dampened in the future.Our price estimate of $11.42 for Travelzoo is at a significant premium to the current market price. In this article, we discuss two key scenarios that can significantly lower our valuation for the company. Travelzoo's Hotel Booking Feature Fails To Gain Sufficient Traction (~20% Downside)Travelzoo introduced the hotel booking option on its websites in Q1 2014. The hotel booking platform enables users to book hotels directly via Travelzoo's website or through mobile products, thus also allowing suppliers to promote deals in a more flexible manner. For example, loading a last minute rate for a hotel has become much easier compared to Travelzoo's previous solution, which redirected users to the hotel's website.Earlier, Travelzoo offered a platform to book discounted travel and entertainment deals. Travelers had no flexibility to book according to their preferences. Also from the hoteliers' perspective, only off-season deals could be published on the website (as peak-season deals are seldom discounted). With the launch of the platform, hotels have the option of selling full-price stays under the commission-based model. [1] [2]Travelzoo's travel segment experienced a decline in net sales in 2014, the first time in the company's history, post the introduction of the booking platform. The offerings were not as attractive as those of its competitors. Travelzoo's management intends to relaunch the platform and aims to provide better content in the first quarter of 2015. [3] Travelzoo witnessed a 10% decline in its 2014 revenue base mainly on account of the failure of the booking platform. Travelzoo's booking platform is still in the testing phase and management is confident of gaining traction by tweaking its features based on user feedback.We currently estimate Travelzoo's total subscriber base to gradually grow by an average of 5%-6%, reaching 43 million by the end of our forecast period. However, there is a possibility that, due to the prolonged lack of traction of the hotel booking platform, the company's subscriber base will decline significantly in the next few years. If Travelzoo's user base declined to 24 million by the end of our forecast period, there will be a 20% decline in our valuation for the company.Acquisitions And Consolidation By Competitors Can Further Dampen Demand For Travelzoo's Services (~10% Downside)Travelzoo's hotel booking feature is eroding the very aspect by which Travelzoo was differentiated from its peers in the online travel space. The discounted deals were the unique selling point for Travelzoo, which to some extent is being overshadowed by the recent developments on Travelzoo's platform. The hotel booking feature is similar to what other online travel agencies (OTAs) such as Priceline or Expedia offer. Given the stature and market share of these companies, it would be very difficult for Travelzoo to make the existing customers for these behemoths to switch loyalties. [3]Additionally, the biggest players in the online travel space are currently on a consolidation mode. Expedia  has recently announced its intention to acquire Orbitz Worldwide (NYSE:OWW). In January 2014, Expedia acquired its marketing partner, Travelocity (read more about the deal here). Historically, the main players in the North American online travel space were Expedia, Priceline), Orbitz, and Travelocity. Now, Expedia might own up to 75% of the U.S. online travel market as a result of its Orbitz acquisition, according to the 2013 market shares provided by PhoCusWright. [4] With increased dominance, Expedia will have a price advantage over its competitors. Travelzoo earns 61% of its revenues from North America, and the revenues might be further eroded with Expedia's increasing influence in the U.S. travel market.Priceline also is gearing up for further acquisitions. In February, it announced its decision to raise $1.13 billion (or 1 billion euros) through a public offering of senior notes. It intends to use part of the fund for acquisitions. Priceline spent around $2.5 billion net of cash acquired on acquisitions in 2014. Priceline had around $8 billion cash on hand in the end of 2014, and the senior notes will add on to that fund. [5]Travelzoo is aiming to differentiate itself from the competition. According to Travelzoo's management, the bigger OTAs are more concerned about the volume of transactions, but Travelzoo gives a lot of emphasis on its members' satisfaction. Hence the quality of offering would differentiate it from competition. For example, Travelzoo aims to continue with the existing discounted deal format (which is its unique selling point) but it will also keep an eye on the customers' preferred timelines.Based on the present scenario, we estimated Travelzoo's travel related revenue per subscriber to decrease 2% per year, reaching $2.98 by the end of our forecast period. However, there's a possibility that the consolidation by Travelzoo's competitors can further decline its pricing power with both its suppliers and users. If Travelzoo's revenue per subscriber declines by an average of 5.5% per year, then our valuation for Travelzoo will decline by almost 10%. Disclosure: No positions."

Travelzoo’s platform provides travel, entertainment, and local deals from thousands of companies. In light of the consistent under performance over the last two years, the company has been striving to reposition itself to better cater to changing user demands.Accordingly, Travelzoo launched a new hotel booking platform last year but didn’t generate enough traction. The company posted $142.1 million in revenues in 2014, reflecting a 10% year-on-year decline, due to poor performance of its Local Deals, Search and Getaway segments. [1] Due to a surge in operating expenses, Travelzoo’s EBITDA margin for 2014 declined to 12.3%, as compared to 18.1% in 2013.Our price estimate of $11.42 for Travelzoo is at a significant premium to the current market price.Travelzoo’s Modified Hotel Booking Platform Is Expected To Show Signs Of RecoveryIn Q1 2014, Travelzoo launched its hotel booking platform, which is available in beta to a select 200,000 members. Prior to the launch, Travelzoo had a platform that offered bookings for discounted travel and entertainment deals. But travelers had no flexibility to book according to their preferences, and hotel owners could only publish off-season deals as peak-season deals are seldom discounted.With the launch of the new platform, hotels can sell full-price stays under the commission-based model and travelers can book hotels via Travelzoo’s website or through its mobile products. [2] [3] Loading last minute rates for hotels has become easier compared to the previous version that redirected users to the hotel’s website. The new platform, intended to offer greater flexibility in hotel booking and a wider range of selection, was expected to help the company in its financial turnaround.However, in its Q4 2014 earnings call, Travelzoo management admitted that the new platform has yet to gain significant traction. The offerings were not as attractive as those of its competitors. The company intended to relaunch the platform with better content in Q1 2015. [4]Travelzoo is striving to differentiate itself from the bigger OTAs by focusing on customer satisfaction rather than volume of transactions, according to the management. The company will continue with the existing discounted deal format (which is its unique selling point) but will also keep an eye on customers’ preferred timelines.Travelzoo’s Future Plans Might Put It On Growth Path Leveraging Big Data To Better Map Consumer BehaviorIn its fourth quarter earnings call, Travelzoo’s management emphasized the importance of big data and advertisements in building its business. Travelzoo is one of the most prominent travel brands on social media, alongside established brands such as Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). It plans to utilize the data available via social media websites and provide more customized products.Focus On Gaining Revenue Generating Users Rather Than Larger User BaseThe company’s focus is on acquiring users who could be instrumental in revenue generation. Its products are targeted to specific customers and is not aimed at the bulk acquisition of subscribers. The company’s advertising strategy has expanded from online channels to offline media. In addition, the Travelzoo Network will continue posting deals to partner sites such as the LA Times, Yahoo Travel, and Frommers.Search And Local Deal Segments Expected To Remain WeakTravelzoo’s search division has performed poorly in the last few quarters on account of intense competition and the company’s delayed investment in the business. Search revenue declined by 25% year on year to ~$18 million in 2014. [5] [6] Currently, search related spending has been on a decline, which is dampening revenues for the division in the short term. However, Travelzoo plans to enhance its search platform based on changing demands.The local deals division, which is mainly driven by a voucher format, is facing waning demand ($22 million revenue in 2014 translating to ~22% year-on-year decline). The company is focusing on new deal formats that better suit customers. The number of live deals placed on websites and applications has increased along with the ease of searching for the deals. The company is continuing to look for a suitable alternative for the rigid voucher format.Disclosure: None"

        We are increasingly concerned with management's lack of urgency in pursuing hotel biz.
        We are no longer expecting a material impact from hotel bookings in Q2.","I have written several articles that were very bullish on Travelzoo's (NASDAQ: TZOO) prospects (see here and here). Much of that bullishness has been due to expectations for a transformation to occur - one in which we begin to see hotel bookings through agency or wholesale deals become a significant portion of the company's revenue. In March I wrote that we were seeing encouraging signs suggesting that the company was taking steps to grow the hotel business at a faster pace, pointing out that its deal with Getaroom and an agency booking engine appeared to put the company in a position that would allow it to expand into many new cities in a very short time frame. I also wrote that I believed ""...the first material revenue impact of the new hotel booking engine will be in the current quarter and expect to see the stock move significantly higher as more tangible evidence emerges of the transformation of Travelzoo"". I now feel the need to qualify that, because the second part remains true, but the first part is no longer.I do still believe that TZOO stock will move significantly higher when more tangible evidence emerges that this transformation is occurring, but I am seeing very little evidence that it is moving forward at the pace I was expecting. I no longer believe that hotel bookings will be a significant contributor to Travelzoo's Q2 numbers as I see no evidence that the company is expanding its inventory footprint in a significant way - nowhere close to what I would have expected given the seasonality of leisure travel bookings and the company's opportunity to capitalize on the key Memorial Day to Labor Day travel window. This is very disappointing and kind of hard to understand. Thus, I am growing more cautious on Travelzoo because I no longer expect hotel bookings to have a material impact on the company's results in Q2 and the implications of the company's turtle like approach are that the ""transformation of Travelzoo"" may take a whole lot longer than I expected if it actually occurs. I still believe there is tremendous value in Travelzoo's assets and shareholders would benefit handsomely in an acquisition scenario. I also still believe the stock could move significantly higher as more tangible evidence emerges of the transformation - I am just not seeing that evidence yet and the fact that Travelzoo is nearly three years into this pivot and there is no front page promotion of the hotel booking engine, no evidence of a big push into new markets and no explanation from management as to why we are still in some kind of beta or testing phase at this stage in the game leaves me very discouraged with the lack of progress and thus much more cautious on what was previously a very bullish outlook for the stock."

Travelzoo released its Q4 2014 results on January 22nd, reporting a 16% decline in revenue (Read our Q4 2014 earnings article). For full-year 2014, the company's top line declined to $142 million, 10.2% lower than 2013. Travelzoo has seen its revenue base decline continuously over the past few quarters on account of its increased investment in a new hotel booking platform and changes to the selling format of its Local Deals business.Travelzoo expected its investments in the hotel platform to show some positive impact toward the end of 2014 and beginning of 2015. However, after the fourth quarter earnings results, it seems that the company still needs a long way to go before it sees any signs of profitability. Our revised forecast for the company's EBITDA margin is the main reason behind the decline in our valuation. The company is yet to reap any meaningful return on the huge investments undertaken in the last few quarters.Due to a surge in its operating expenses, Travelzoo's EBITDA margin for 2014 declined to 12.3%, as compared to 18.1% in 2013. We expect Travelzoo's EBITDA margin to increase over our forecast period as investment levels come down in the next few years to reach around 15% by the end of our forecast period. This margin would still be well below the 2013 levels of 18%.The main reasons for Travelzoo's margin contraction are:Travelzoo's EBITDA Margins Declined To 12.3% In 2014: All The Segments Incurred Losses In 2014In our old model we made a forecast that Travelzoo's 2014 adjusted EBITDA would be around $29 million. However, the actual figure came in much lower at around $18 million. Consequently, we have revised our forecast for this driver and now expect EBITDA margin to reach 14.5% by the end of our forecast period. In our old model we expected EBITDA margin to increase to 22.4%. The change led to around a 35% decline in our valuation for the company. The remaining 10% decline came from a change in forecast primarily for the number of subscribers, average revenue per thousand searches, the number of markets covered and the other updates for 2014.The company's adjusted EBITDA margin (adjusted EBIDTA margin is adjusted EBITDA/Revenue, where, adjusted EBITDA = Income from Operations + Stock-based Compensation + Depreciation & Amortization) for 2014 stands at 12.3% as against 18.1% in 2013. The reasons for the decline are:With the increased investment in its pipeline and no significant return on those investments still in sight, we believe Travelzoo's recent downhill performance trend is here to stay for a while.Travelzoo's Hotel Booking Platform Still Not Witnessing Expected GrowthTravelzoo introduced the hotel booking option on its websites in Q1 2014. Travelzoo brought about a transformation in its previous business model with this option. The hotel booking platform enables users to book hotels directly via Travelzoo's website or through mobile products, thus allowing suppliers to promote deals in a more flexible manner. For example, loading a last minute rate for a hotel has become much easier compared to Travelzoo's previous solution, which redirected users to the hotel's website.Also earlier, Travelzoo offered a platform to book discounted travel and entertainment deals. Hence, there was no flexibility to book according to customer preferences. From the perspective of hotels, only off season deals could be published on the website (as peak-season deals are seldom discounted). Many hotels could not participate on Travelzoo either because they were unable to operate under the voucher model or they did not want to run advertisements for discounted deals, but preferred a commission based model for transactions. With the launch of the platform, hotels have the option of selling full-price stays under the commission based model. [2] [3]On the flip side, the hotel booking feature is eroding the very aspect by which Travelzoo was differentiated from its peers in the online travel space.The discounted deals were the unique selling point for Travelzoo, which to some extent is being overshadowed by the recent developments on hotel booking.

Given the stature and market share of these companies, it would be very difficult for Travelzoo to make the existing customers for these behemoths switch loyalties.

3082816,20809,2015-04-20T13:56:06-04:00,Travelzoo reported top and bottom line well above analysts' estimates.Management confirmed company focus on hotel booking initiative.The hotel booking business will transform Travelzoo & create significant shareholder wealth.,"Travelzoo (NASDAQ: TZOO) reported earnings late last week and came through with a very strong top and bottom line that appeared to take many (particularly short sellers) by surprise. Travelzoo's stock rallied over 30% following the report. Management's gloomy outlook and talking down of expectations on the Q4 call led many to believe that Q1 might be breakeven at best and even then still below the analysts' estimates. Instead, Travelzoo reported earnings of 13 cents per share, a full 5 cents per share higher than analysts' expectations and reported a top line of $36.5m, beating the revenue estimate by $1.7m.A couple of months ago we hypothesized that Travelzoo was not retreating from the hotel booking business in spite of the many commentators who were suggesting that very thing after the company reported poor Q42014 earnings and mentioned a ""retrenching"" of sorts on the conference call. Travelzoo management left no doubt about the company's intentions on last week's call when Executive Chairman Holger Bartel stated ""..our main focus is on hotels at this time"". Additionally, management made some very positive comments regarding the hotel booking business including the following -1) ""We continued to run more deals through our Hotel Booking Platform instead of the Getaways model"". We do not believe that Travelzoo management would not continue to do this unless the economics continued to be stronger with the hotel booking engine than with Getaways.2) ""We have very good coverage now in sort of the top 10 destinations for North America"". This is an significant improvement over the fourth quarter and hopefully an indicator of more to come. We note that some part of that ""good coverage"" is due to Travelzoo's deal with Getaroom.com and a third-party provider of hotel booking connectivity that Travelzoo is using to make agency bookings (thanks to GrooveVC for unearthing this). We had been expecting to see Travelzoo affiliate with one of the larger players in the hotel booking space to gain the critical mass of inventory they need to fully leverage their large base of subscribers, and we were pleased to discover recently that Travelzoo.com is live with such a deal to access the inventory of Getaroom, a rapidly-growing wholesaler of lodging that now counts 80,000+ hotels in its program. It appears that Travelzoo is offering the Getaroom inventory in quite a few markets already, and we would not be surprised to see Travelzoo eventually roll out Getaroom and/or other partner's inventory in other markets of significance over the next few months.We believe that Getaroom is a great strategic partner for Travelzoo as it allows them to get the hotel inventory they need (80,000+ inventory and deep coverage in every market of significance in North America) without boosting the fortunes of their biggest competitors (Priceline & Expedia) in the space. Additionally, it allows them to offer rates that are unique from those of its ubiquitous competitors whose far-flung affiliate partners (see Mr. Bartel's Trivago conversation on the call about this very situation) make their rates seem like the going market rate when in fact there may be a better rate for consumers who will shop Travelzoo in their shopping process. Getaroom often has lower total prices than Expedia, Booking.com, Priceline, etc., and Travelzoo will benefit tremendously from being able to offer rates that are distinct (and in many cases lower) from those offered by its larger competitors.Getaroom is run by Bob Diener and David Litman, the original founders of Hotel Reservations Network, which became Hotels.com. Messrs. Diener and Litman essentially invented the wholesale lodging business that transformed Expedia from a marginally profitable OTA into a powerhouse that eventually gobbled up most of its competitors and that allowed Priceline go from company doing a reverse split to avoid penny stock status to the $1200+/- stock it is today. While Priceline's (NASDAQ: PCLN) wholesale business is now secondary to its agency hotel business (booking.com), I think it is fair to say that the engine that powered the growth of Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE) and Priceline has its roots in the model developed by the pioneers who now lead Getaroom.com and we think this is great company for Travelzoo.We continue to believe that the hotel booking business will transform Travelzoo and create significant wealth for shareholders, so we are pleased to see the company taking the steps we have long believed needed to be taken to expand the hotel business at a faster pace. Travelzoo's arrangement with Getaroom will allow them to better leverage their subscriber base and expand their market coverage significantly in a very short time frame as they gain very broad and deep inventory with unique ""Best Rate Guaranteed"" rates. Additionally, we believe that Travelzoo's ability to offer rack rates in an agency style booking offering will become a big factor too, as the combination of the two inventory sources should allow Travelzoo to offer significant inventory in every market in North America very soon.In summary, we believe Travelzoo's first-quarter report indicates that the company has turned a corner with its core operations and that the transformation of Travelzoo to a company with a rapidly growing top and bottom line is underway. The rally in Travelzoo shares on such large volume suggests that new investors are starting to understand what can happen here as the company transforms its model and those that have previously bet against Travelzoo may finally be coming around too. With over 1/3 of the ""true public float"" sold short prior to the release of the quarterly report and recent reports showing that hedge funds at BlackRock and Osmium have been adding significantly to their holdings, it's no wonder that there was such scrambling for shares after the quarter's numbers were released. We continue to believe Travelzoo shares are very cheap on a sum of the parts analysis, in a takeover scenario and also just generally based on the P/E ratio as the denominator moves higher with each quarter that includes more hotel bookings. We believe the first material revenue impact of the new hotel booking engine will be seen in the current quarter's results and expect to see the stock move significantly higher as more tangible evidence emerges of the hotel booking initiative gaining traction."

There has been much consolidation in the online travel space over the last year as TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP), Priceline (NASDAQ: PCLN) and Alibaba (NASDAQ: BABA) have all completed multiple acquisitions to build out or enhance some part of their business. But these last two deals taking down two of the most significant players in the online travel space since OTAs have existed likely heralds an uptick in the pace of the consolidation going forward and what will likely be more urgency by the established players to keep key assets and talent from finding their way to the Amazons, Alibabas and Groupons (NASDAQ: GRPN). We note Expedia management's comments on their deal for Orbitz today, which was driven by their desire to scoop up a""..strong brand and impressive team"" and we expect to see more of these kinds of deals in the weeks ahead. With Alibaba, Amazon, Groupon and even Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) nibbling away at market share in various online travel niches, the entrenched players have every incentive to try to beat these well capitalized new online travel space entrants to the punch, which bodes well for the remaining independents.The two most obvious players that have the ""strong brand/impressive team"" that should attract multiple bidders are HomeAway (NASDAQ: AWAY-OLD) and Travelzoo (NASDAQ: TZOO).HomeAway is the largest player in the traditional vacation rental market (as opposed to the slightly different rental market targeted by AirBnB) and it has built an enviable lead in the market for non hotel lodging inventory. Built up over the last 9 years by rolling up many different high traffic subscription based rental listing sites, HomeAway has in the last two years made a deft pivot to attract professional vacation rental management companies and vacation rental owners who are willing to pay a commission for online reservations instead of paying the annual subscription. The beauty of this to its shareholders (and potential acquirers) is that HomeAway has done such a great job attracting consumers to book their vacations through HomeAway's sites that the company will often make more money taking a commission than they would accepting the flat fee associated with a subscription listing. Obviously there is additional risk in that model, both in execution and in potential for disruption (hurricanes wipe out commissions too but they don't impact annual subscription revenue), but we believe this will eventually lead to expanded listings and expanded margins. In addition to its long standing reputation as the go-to service for vacation rental owners, the company has rolled up five of the top property management software platforms (Escapia, First Resort, Entech, Property Plus and v12) and they have only recently completed the integration work necessary to allow those disparate systems to seamlessly feed rental unit level data into its Homeaway.com, VRBO.com and VacationRentals.com websites.Despite the company's strides over the last year or two in bringing non traditional lodging into the mainstream, HomeAway's stock has fallen from highs near $49 down to new lows over the last few weeks in the $25 range. HomeAway rose $2.33 in today's trading session following the announcement of Expedia's bid for Orbitz. Despite what will likely be a pretty hefty price tag (a 20% premium from the existing range would push to nearly $3.5Billion), we think the uniqueness of the inventory HomeAway can bring to the table and the scarcity of similarly situated assets will result in a bidding war for HomeAway with the most likely bidders being Priceline, TripAdvisor and Expedia.While we see it as a foregone conclusion that HomeAway will be acquired, we think Travelzoo may be off the market even sooner than HomeAway. Travelzoo is one of the online travel industry's longest standing brands and its reputation for delivering travel value to consumers, its 24 million plus subscribers, profitable operations and extremely cheap valuation make it an attractive candidate for acquisition for any of the significant players in online travel. Travelzoo is extremely cheap by any fundamental measure and even after today's bump on the Orbitz news, the market is only valuing the company (market cap minus cash) at about $84 million. This is a company with a very unique online travel asset in its 24 million subscribers and an active base of users whose travel purchases over the last four or five years have allowed Travelzoo to earn significantly more than Orbitz did over that same time period. Given that Expedia's deal for Orbitz values it at about 20x Travelzoo's current enterprise value, you get the idea of how remarkably low Travelzoo's stock had fallen in the weeks following a disappointing Q4 report. The right buyer who can leverage that base with an existing hotel booking product could likely pay a multiple of Travelzoo's current trading price and still find the deal accretive.Adding to our belief that Travelzoo will be the next to go is our awareness of situations with significant holders of Travelzoo who have recently made attempts at discussions with management, the kind of conversations that in the past were encouraged but have over the last few weeks been characterized by unreturned emails and phone calls. Management has gone completely silent and we believe this is likely due to a sales process that is already in motion or possibly even an attempt by management to take Travelzoo private. The current $84 million enterprise value for Travelzoo is just way too low for the assets involved and no one is more aware of this valuation disconnect than Travelzoo management. With close to 60% of shares outstanding already owned by insiders and $54 million in the bank, there is almost enough cash on hand to buy the remaining shares.If Travelzoo has already started a sale process, we would expect multiple bidders and believe that Trip Advisor, Alibaba, Amazon and Groupon would be among the most likely to bid aggressively for Travelzoo's assets. We also believe that Travelzoo will fetch a significantly higher premium than the 25% Expedia paid for Orbitz.In summary, we believe Expedia's purchase of Orbitz will cause the pace of consolidation in the online travel industry to quicken from its already torrid pace and HomeAway and Travelzoo shareholders will ultimately be among the biggest beneficiaries."
3023716,43971,2015-03-25T07:58:39-04:00,Speculative bet to be sized small.Turnaround/business model transformation could be successful and/or company could be acquired.Appealing absolute-basis valuation and trading at substantial discount to comps.Governance deficiencies largely offset by huge insider stake.,"Long Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) @ $9.87 on 3/20/15SummaryThe company has received M&A interest in the past and the travel industry is red hot right now in terms of M&A activity. The company is also in the process of rolling out a hotel booking platform, which would leverage the brand and member base to transition the company from a media company to a media/tech hybrid. If it is acquired or successfully turned around, substantial returns (25%+ annually) over 3 years are easy to imagine. Even if the business stagnates and isn't acquired, 0.5x revenue with revenue down to $120M implies < 20% downside. It's a favorable bet, but a bet nonetheless and should be sized small.Company OverviewTravelzoo is a travel media company that was founded in 1998. The firm recognizes revenue from three sources:#1 - Travel - 68% revenue - mostly advertising revenue but also vouchersA team of former journalists ""producers"" review travel deals, vet them, and create a list of the ""Top 20"" which are sent out to an email list of 23 million members weekly and featured on the Travelzoo website and mobile app. The content is also syndicated to other sources to expand its reach. Together with the company's Getaway vouchers, this makes up 68% of revenue.#2 - Search - 12% revenue - advertisingThe company has search products in Fly.com and SuperSearch with about 2.5m monthly searches each which generate revenue per click (the booking does not occur on Travelzoo site/app).#3 - Local - 20% revenue - voucherThe Local Deals voucher product is similar to Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN).The most significant elements of the current model are:The company operates in North America (67% revenue) and Europe (33%). The Travelzoo brand is also present in Asia Pacific but this business is owned separately by an entity of the company's founder (yes, this is a governance concern and will be discussed below).The company has 438 employees, 27m members, and 25 offices.Industry OverviewThe online travel industry can generally be divided into Online Travel Agencies (""OTAs"") and metasearch. OTAs are a pull platform for users to search through ""inventory"" that the OTAs secure from suppliers (hotels, airlines). The user enters their criteria (such as departure date), matching inventory is displayed, and the user can book directly on the OTA site, in which case the OTA gets a commission based on a percentage of the booking dollar value. The most significant OTA players are:Metasearch allows users to enter criteria as they would on an OTA site. The results are pulled from many OTA sites and supplier sites, allowing for easier comparison. The booking does not take place on the metasearch site. Instead, metasearch sites generate revenue through advertising (primarily sponsored listings and clicks). Some metasearch sites are building booking capability and the distinction between metasearch and OTA is likely to blur. Significant metasearch players include:Travelzoo does not fit into either of these categories, but does compete with both. The company also competes with deals companies, the biggest of which are:Finally, the company competes with pay-per-click advertising (MSN, Yahoo (YHOO), and Google).Travelzoo is building a hotel booking platform like that of an OTA, but now and in the future, all of the above will be its competition. It's a very competitive industry with a great deal of brand diversity. However, many different brands are owned by just two companies - Priceline and Expedia, and it is such a large market ($1.3T for leisure travel in US and Europe, $140B for local media in US) with room for further penetration (60% of US travel expenditures occur online, 50% of Europe travel, and 25% of US local media), that I think Travelzoo can exist profitably in a niche.M&A PotentialThere have been quite a bit of acquisitions in the travel industry very recently and over the last few years. The table below lists significant relevant acquisitions by Expedia, Priceline, Google, and TripAdvisor since 2011.Travelzoo has a very strong balance sheet that could be used in part to finance a deal.GrooveVC has written several articles on the stock and brings up two significant points:Travelzoo has drawn interest as an acquisition target before, most recently in April 2012, when it sought a financial advisor amid rumors it was being pursued by ""private equity firms and trade buyers.""It is now one of the only significant independent travel/deal companies left. It seems like the consolidation is largely a brand grab. Expedia had all of the capabilities of Travelocity and Orbitz, but acquired them nonetheless and will maintain their brands. Travelzoo also has a strong brand as evidenced by its 27m members and 2.4M social media (Facebook + Twitter) followers. However, I wonder if it has comparable brand recognition to a Travelocity or Orbitz as it does not seem to utilize television advertising as heavily as peers do. Before beginning my research, I'd heard of most of the other travel brands, but not Travelzoo and that's been the case for the few people I've asked. I also wonder if Travelzoo won't appeal to the likes of Expedia and Priceline because it's fundamentally a different kind of business. Travelzoo does not have much in the way of proprietary technology and is probably better characterized as a travel media company.The company is cheaply valued at 0.64x EV/Revenue, 5.6x LTM EBITDA, and 6.7x LTM EBIT. An acquisition could actually be justified by the member acquisition costs alone. In FY14, the company's CPA (cost per member) was $2.66. Applying that to the 27m members gets me $72m, not terribly less than the current EV of $91m.The company also has bloated corporate overhead. G&A expense consists mainly of compensation for administrative and executive staff. It was $30.6m or 21.5% of sales in FY14. With LTM EBITDA and EBIT of $16m and $13.5m respectively, even $5M of G&A savings would significantly affect the value of the company. Advertising is also primarily member acquisition costs, which are spent based on the lifetime value of the member. The company's LTV/CPM is currently about 4/1, so the investment makes sense, but it is an investment in the future and is discretionary, yet it is all expensed in the current period. In FY14, sales and marketing was $67.2m, 30% or $20.2m was advertising. I am not saying that TZOO is FAR more profitable than its GAAP financials would indicate, but I do think steady state profitability is significantly higher than $15-20m in annual EBITDA. I also think (1) potential acquirers realize this and (2) larger acquirers would be in a position to realize some of these savings.Finally, co-founders Ralph and Holger Bartel own just over 50% of the stock and have a near zero cost basis. There is very little information about the Bartels in the public domain, however Ralph Bartel has financial interests in real estate and fashion and may want to cut ties with TZOO. Holger took on executive responsibilities late last year - perhaps to prepare the company for sale.Business QualityTravelzoo has excellent employee relations:The business generates high ROIC and gross margins. FY14 revenue and EBITDA of $142m and $16m respectively compare to just $9m of net PP&E and $22.6m of non-cash current assets. Gross margin in FY14 was 87%.The travel and deal industries in the US and Europe give the company a TAM of $1.5T and growing.The global travel market has grown 4.3% per annum 2011-2015 to $1.3T. The online market grew 10%/year over same period.The business is actually recession-resistant because it is an advertising model and even though travel expenditures decrease in tough economic times, vacancies and in turn advertising dollars increase.The value proposition to the member is strong as Travelzoo's featured deals have a reputation for being among the highest in the deals/travel industry and members see these deals at no cost.Operations & ValuationTravelzoo's business has struggled of late. Revenue was down 10% in FY14 and 16% y/y in Q4.The company cut advertising significantly over the last few years and member growth stalled. Lax expense control led to the advertising savings being used inefficiently, so there was not an offsetting margin benefit.Source: TZOO Q4 14 IR Presentation""Advertising expenses accounted for 30%, 36% and 41%, respectively, of total sales and marketing expenses and consisted primarily of online advertising, which we refer to as traffic acquisition cost and member acquisition costs."" - FY14 10-KEBITDA margin has actually declined from 25% in FY11 to just 11% in FY14 - that on an 87% gross margin:Consumers are being conditioned by other platforms to expect the ability to book on-site and have customized deals through a ""pull"" platform. This, along with some turmoil as the company rolls out its hotel booking platform, is causing members to be less active as measured by revenue per member:Source: TZOO Q4 14 IR PresentationRevenue per member declined 13.5% in FY14.The plan is to spend more on advertising - $2-3m incrementally per quarter or as much as the P&L will allow with the company profitable. Chairman, former CEO, and Co-Founder Holger Bartel took on executive responsibilities last September, mainly to accelerate the rollout of the hotel booking platform. In testing, the booking platform increased revenue per customer to $54 from $13 in the voucher model. However, the company is very late to hotel booking and it is proving a difficult endeavor to roll a platform out comparable to much larger peers.Alexa.com shows the travelzoo.com site increasing in traffic rank substantially over the last year (keep in mind the company operates other domains - travelzoo.com, travelzoo.ca, travelzoo.co.uk, travelzoo.de, travelzoo.es, travelzoo.fr, among others).Source: Alexa.comOn the other hand, the Android and iOS apps have both declined in ranking in the respective travel categories.iOS:Android:Source: App AnnieGiven the mixed data on traffic and the early stage in the turnaround, it's hard to know at this point if the turnaround will be successful. I'm not comfortable assuming much more or less than 50% odds in this case.This uncertainty must be dealt with via underwriting. What are the probabilities of each outcome and the magnitude of benefit/loss? If the turnaround is successful, I could see the company earning $175m in revenue in 3 years. This implies annual growth of 7%. It is also far below the $210-245m that the company communicated as a target in Q4:Source: TZOO Q4 14 IR PresentationA 17% EBITDA margin, well below the previous high of 25%, and, 9x EV/EBITDA multiple and implied 1.5x revenue multiple, well below peers, gets me to 116% total upside or 29% annually over 3 years:If the turnaround is unsuccessful, 0.5x revenue on reduced revenue will likely serve as a floor because:Long-term EV/Revenue:Source: YChartsEarly 2009 EV/Revenue:Source: YChartsIn the adverse case, the total loss is only 17% from current levels.The disparity between TZOO's valuation and that of its peers should be taken with a grain of salt, as TZOO is more of a travel media business whereas the others are deemed technology companies, but I still think the disparity is extreme. TZOO trades at about a quarter of the level of its peers.I take comfort that the stock is at a 6-year low and at one point traded at about 8 times the current price.Source: YChartsGovernanceOutside of uncertainty surrounding the business model transformation and turnaround, my biggest concern about the company is its governance deficiencies. In a nutshell, there are many reasons to be concerned about the company's corporate governance, all of which are largely offset - but not completely and not enough to ignore the concerns and invest heavily - by the Bartels' (co-founders) 50% stake.Why be concerned about governance?Promotional SharesWhen the company was founded in 1998, the tech bubble was forming and some fledgling internet companies resorted to issuing promotional shares, i.e. shares that were distributed free to new customers, including Travelzoo. In 2002, the company, then Travelzoo.com Corporation, merged into Travelzoo Inc. Promotional shareholders were given a window of 2 years to prove they had shares in the former entity and exchange for shares in TZOO. Some didn't and for many years since, the company has battled with some of these shareholders and states representing them regarding the legality of stock expiry. The matter is largely resolved at this point, but settlement with a few states is still pending due diligence in Q1 2015.Reverse/Forward Stock SplitOne result of the promotional share issuance was that the company had an unusually high number of shareholders. To reduce this number and the associated administrative costs, the company exercised a 1-for-25 reverse stock split followed immediately by a 25-for-1 forward split. Shareholders owning less than 25 shares prior to split received cash. They were effectively forced out of their ownership interest. I'm not sure if the proceeds were subject to taxes, but if they were, it looks even worse.APAC Related Party SaleIn late 2009, the company sold its Asia Pacific business to Azzurro Capital, an entity of founder and 50% owner, Ralph Bartel. The price was just $3.6m with a working capital adjustment. The rationale for the deal, as communicated by the company, was that APAC was in the red and masking the company's performance in the US and that it would require substantial capital to expand and improve APAC, which the company had better uses for. While APAC was in the red, it was still very young and performance was improving substantially. Revenue went from almost nothing in 2008 to a run rate of over $2M in the first half of 2009 and loss from ops was reduced from a run rate of ($12M) to ($7.1M)Source: TZOO Q2 2009 10-QCash flow from operating activities was even better than EBIT. In the 10 months prior to sale, APAC OCF was just ($3.4M). APAC subscribers had gone from zero to 1.55M or almost 10% of the company's total in just 2 years. Cost per member acquisition was declining to slightly less than in the US and much lower than Europe at $2.12/member. While I am averse to young, money-losing businesses, at that point I'd say Travelzoo was being accepted in Asia. It was already a proven concept in the US and Europe and APAC was and is a less penetrated travel market. At that time, Travelzoo's APAC business was the kind that would have had a bubbly valuation in 1999-2000 and now, yet it was sold for less than 2x revenue and barely a premium to member acquisition costs at $2.40/member.A special committee of independent directors was formed to advise on the sale. The initial agreement was non-exclusive and there was 30 days for other bids to be received. During these 30 days, there was a termination fee to Azzurro Capital, but it was only $54k. A lawsuit against the company by a shareholder states that the company never disclosed if other bids were received. In connection with the sale, Travelzoo received an option expiring in 2020 to repurchase APAC at a price equal to the fair value determined by a mutually arranged, independent appraisal. I don't attach much value in this, as the company would have to pay up for any increase in APAC value in the interim. The lawsuit was unsuccessful, but now the IRS is after the company for additional taxes ($31M) because it believes that ""the Asia Pacific business segment assets sold by the Company had a significantly higher valuation than the sales proceeds the Company received upon the sale."" I doubt the company will end up owing a significant amount as it intends to fight any potential assessment, has not reserved for the loss, and the transaction does not seem legally questionable based on the shareholder lawsuit being thrown out in court and the provisions of the deal. However, I do think the IRS view suggests that the sale may not have been in the best interest of TZOO minority shareholders, at least not at a price of $3.6M.Brother of founder involved in companyHolger and Ralph Bartel are brothers. While both seem highly competent and Holger passionate about the business (I can't find recent communications from Ralph), this may concern some investors.Recent Management TurnoverShirley Tafoya resigned in September. Her resignation was announced in conjunction with Holger taking on executive duties. She had been President, North America and was the company's 12th employee, with the company since 2001. Mark Webb, President of Travelzoo Local, left company in April 2014. The press release announcing his resignation said, ""The management changes are made in response to the continued weakness in the company's local voucher sales and declining search revenues.""Very little information in public domain on the BartelsI did not have any trouble finding information and interviews of the company's CEO, Christopher Loughlin, but in contrast, it was very difficult finding anything on the Bartels. Holger does, however, provide extensive commentary in the company's recent conference call.But…. Huge Incentive to be shareholder-friendlyAll of this is very concerning, but the Bartels and Loughlin still have a very significant incentive to act in the best interest of shareholders. The Bartels own just over half of the company and have not sold a share since February 2013 @ $21. Loughlin has 300k options with an exercise price of $15/share. If the stock gets to $20, that's $1.5M in incremental funds to him or about 1.5 year's pay.ConclusionIf there was more certainty surrounding the turnaround/transition of the company and if governance was better, I'd load up on the stock, but even in the presence of these factors, I think the stock is a worthwhile bet to be sized small under $10. As I finish writing this on Monday 3/23, the stock has jumped over 4%. Perhaps the market is beginning to recognize the quality of the company, the significant discount to peers TZOO trades at, the absolute basis return potential in the case of a successful turnaround, and the very real possibility of the company being acquired."
2558495,20809,2014-10-14T17:18:17-04:00,"The time to buy Travelzoo stock is this week.Travelzoo is so cheap that a significant share buyback, LBO or acquisition is inevitable.Travelzoo is ripe for a short squeeze with multiple potential catalysts.Travelzoo is following the Priceline playbook for merchant hotel entry and it could be a game changer.","When I say buy now, I mean investors should buy Travelzoo (NASDAQ: TZOO) shares this week. And by this week, I mean today ASAP or after earnings are released on Thursday, got it?Let me explain. For those with some tolerance for risk who have a long term outlook, the time to buy is as soon as you can place your order. Below are 5 reasons (plus one more thing) to buy TZOO shares ASAP:1) Travelzoo stock is very cheapTravelzoo's stock is trading around $14.40 as of this morning, the lowest price it has traded in the last four years. Travelzoo at $14.40 is cheap by historical standards, on a P/E basis (trading at just over 12x conservative 2015 estimates), P/S basis (1.43x), on a technical basis (extremely oversold) and when compared with its peers in the online travel space, it is quite simply dirt cheap:2) Travelzoo is a prime takeover candidateWith 27 million subscribers to its ""Top 20"" deals newsletter, a rapidly growing installed base of App downloads/active mobile users and a long history of providing real value to traveling consumers, Travelzoo's ability to reach a very broad audience without adding to Google/Yahoo/Bing's search revenue makes it a unique jewel. With Priceline (NASDAQ: PCLN), Trip Advisor (NASDAQ: TRIP), Expedia (NASDAQ: EXPE), Orbitz (NYSE: OWW) etc. spending hundreds of millions battling each other in Google/Bing's pay per click arbitrage competition for new customers, you have to wonder how long it will be before one of them puts their very highly valued acquisition currency to work by making a run at Travelzoo. Additionally, the value Travelzoo could add for Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN) or Alibaba (NASDAQ: BABA) could be 2-3x the current Travelzoo market cap and I would not be surprised to see a bidding war emerge if the TZOO BOD were to hire a banker to seek strategic alternatives.3) Travelzoo may announce a significant stock buybackNo crystal ball needed here, just connecting the dots. In Q2 2011, the TZOO BOD executed a stock buyback because the stock had fallen so far below its intrinsic value that they were able to buy back half a million shares on the open market at an average price of $30.20 per share. The BOD has approved two other buybacks since then (see here and here) both with the shares at significantly higher prices than where it is currently trading. With the stock trading significantly lower now, the company's prospects for revenue and earnings growth improving, the company's cash hoard very large ($60m+) and growing, the only way I could see the board not enacting a more significant share repurchase authorization very soon is if they are instead looking into a process to buy ALL of the shares because....4) Travelzoo is a prime LBO candidateGiven the valuations in the travel space, TZOO's unique position in that market, the potential for revenue / profit gains as it scales its merchant hotel business and the ready availability of capital for such an endeavor, I would not be surprised to learn that Travelzoo management are considering a deal to take down the other 44% that they do not already own. No way this discussion hasn't occurred and management's silence as the stock has drifted lower over the last few months has been deafening.5) Travelzoo is primed for a short squeezeTravelzoo has a long history of punishing short sellers. More than once over the last ten years, TZOO shares have pushed from the teens up to nearly $100 per share in a fairly short time frame due to what appeared to be short covering. There are 14.73m million shares outstanding, but management owns 56% of those shares leaving only 6.8m ""tradeable"" shares. And of that those 6.8 million tradeable shares, 4.41m are owned by institutions, so the true ""free trading"" float is really only about 2.4m shares. As the share price has fallen, the trading volumes have trended lower and lower, leaving Travelzoo today as very, very thinly traded. As of the most recent Nasdaq short interest report (Sept. 30), 500k+ shares were sold short or a little more than 25% of the ""free trading float"". Since that report, the stock has fallen over $1 per share lower, so it is entirely possible that the current short interest is even higher than the Sept. 30 measure. The volume traded each day has trended lower since that report also, to the degree that we have recently been averaging less than 50k shares traded per day. Thus, it would take over 10 trading days (two full weeks of trading) where 100% of the volume traded was short covering for the entire short interest to be covered. Thus, the reality is that this short position would be very difficult to cover in even four or five weeks of trading without pushing the shares significantly higher. As the buy to cover orders begat more buy to cover orders, it is easy to see how Travelzoo could get squeezed significantly higher even without a significant catalyst like a stock buyback, increasing investor awareness of the likelihood of a TZOO transaction (acquisition or LBO) or broader investor recognition of the impact Travelzoo's new merchant hotel business is going to have on its revenues and earnings going forward.The Other Definition of ""Now""For the more risk averse, ""now"" means buying after the stock adjusts to reflect the earnings report due out towards the end of this week. The risk averse ""now"" buyers are betting that the company will report a real dud of a quarter and that investors will get the opportunity to buy the shares even cheaper. That is possible given the broader market weakness and how that context can impact the trading in the event of a subpar earnings report. But don't forget that TZOO shares have already fallen from their then 52 week low of $17 to the current four year low of $14.40 in the 30 days since the 8-k announcing the resignation of the president of the North American market, and the consolidation of the founders' power on the BOD and in the executive suite. And while it appears that the market has already priced in some degree of negative results, if TZOO reports a complete meltdown it is entirely possible that the shares could trade lower still so you might be able to pick up some shares at cheaper prices.One more thing on the earnings report. I do not believe anyone is expecting there to be much of anything that is positive in it, but watch for one thing that I think will be one of the biggest reasons many investors will want to own TZOO shares going forward. Each of the online travel companies used for PE comparisons in the list above has achieved that lofty valuation largely because of its merchant hotel/lodging bookings. Not one of them was consistently profitable before they tweaked their business model to push their merchant hotel offerings. The greatest example of this is Priceline, whose management took a failing business model whose best asset was a brand name that consumers broadly associated with travel bargains and leveraged it with merchant hotel offerings that allowed the company to actually start to turn a profit. They methodically built that business in the US through their Travelweb acquisition in 2004, then over the next 18 months acquired their way into Europe (Active Hotels) and (Bookings.com). Take a look at a chart of Priceline's stock price in the months and years following their entry to the merchant hotel business:PCLN data by YChartsThe thing to watch for in the Travelzoo report is its merchant hotel bookings. Like Priceline, Travelzoo has built a reputation for offering its subscribers tremendous travel bargains for years and has built up a huge following (27m+ subscribers) over the years. Travelzoo has spent the last 12-18 months building out the technology, infrastructure and relationships that will allow TZOO to be the merchant of record and take a cut of each hotel booking (the guts of the merchant hotel booking business) like Priceline did over a similar time frame in 2004 and 2005. Over the last six months TZOO has begun to offer hotels in this model with a very limited rollout of starting with 500 hotels that were initially offered to online PC visitors only and evolved in Q3 to include mobile bookings. This Q3 report will be the first time merchant hotel bookings have been available for both online and mobile consumers. The revenue on these bookings is considered to be earned after the stay is completed and hotel stays are typically booked in advance where lead times can be as much as several months, so the recognition of the revenue associated with these bookings can be days, weeks or months after the booking occurs. Thus, I do not expect a significant revenue impact in Q3. While the merchant hotel revenue in Q3 may be only minimally impactful to the top and bottom lines, I do believe the implications of the results will be such that management will begin to rapidly scale that aspect of the business materially in North America and that merchant hotel bookings will be the primary driver of revenue and profitability growth in 2015. The expense required to build out this scale has largely been invested over the last four or five quarters, so TZOO is really just starting to see the return on this investment. As they scale this business in North America, add Europe and Asia (TZOO holds an option to acquire their Travelzoo Asia affiliate), I believe the potential is there for exponential gains over the long term and possibly even a long term chart that looks similar to the Priceline chart above.In summary, the time to buy Travelzoo is now. Define ""now"" how you will, but shares of Travelzoo purchased this week could return 100% or more over the next 12-18 months and potentially much more even sooner than that in the event of a short squeeze."

It could be argued that they have actually had quite the opposite, as the company's odyssey to unwind its ""free stock"" promotion from over a decade ago has included a program created to make cash payouts to individual claimants, payouts to most states for unclaimed property and even a reverse/forward stock split to reduce the number of shares held by owners of less than 25 shares. All of these things share one common thread - in each case the amount of money the company had to pay was tied to the trading price of TZOO shares. Thus, one could argue that prudence and good stewardship by TZOO management almost required that they avoid promotional efforts or the doing of anything that could cause the stock to move higher over the last few quarters.Expenses are front end loaded, revenue to followThe timing of TZOO's new hotel booking engine launch has coincided perfectly with this period of malaise, as the technology and marketing costs are expensed upfront as the company began offering links to search for hotels and then began inserting the new Travelzoo booking engine hotel deals into many of the positions that were previously filled with ""Getaways"" hotel voucher deals. There are two significant things that occur when TZOO inserts a hotel offering under the new online booking model into a spot that would previously offer a Getaways voucher - 1) the revenue TZOO earns per deal increases materially2) the recognition of that revenue is delayed 40-50 days on average vs. a Getways voucher booking/sale.Thus, during this period when management and shareholders gained some benefit from the stock being lower, the company's operations were being fortified for new growth in a very high potential business that had an extremely front end loaded expense structure. The other thing management has been doing the last couple of quarters is spend more heavily to acquire new subscribers. Like the considerable costs to build out the new hotel booking business, the expense to acquire new subscribers is paid upfront while the money earned from that subscriber usually follows over a period of months and years. Thus, what we have seen over the last 12 months is the heavy front end cost of building this new high margin / high potential business, while we will not begin to see the revenue impact until Q4.Travelzoo shareholders and short sellers alike are probably aware of Travelzoo's history as a stock that can move dramatically over just a few months' time. TZOO went from 21 to 110 between June 2004 and December 2004. In May 2010, TZOO rose from approximately $12 to as high as 103 by March 2011. Thus, when Travelzoo begins to turn a corner operationally and/or is perceived to be in the crosshairs of potential acquirers, its stock can ascend rapidly in just a few months. Given what happened with Priceline's stock over a several year period after they switched their focus from deals on air tickets to booking hotels, it is obvious that the successful pursuit of that niche can be a major game changer. We believe that Travelzoo recognizes this (as evidenced by Holger Bartel's return and stated focus of an expedited buildout of the content / hotel inventory) and has ramped this aspect of their business dramatically by increasing their hotel offerings by nearly 300% over the last 60 days, growing its bookable hotel offerings from around 500 at the end of Q3 to over 1500 as of our last channel check on November 24.As the number of hotels on Travelzoo's online booking platform went from approximately 500 in Q3 to over 1500 as of today, the cost of the additional staff and resources necessary to grow the business at that rate and the labor and technology necessary to connect with those hotels is an expense that was paid over the last 12 months. Q3 was the first full quarter that this type of hotel booking was offered to Travelzoo's full customer base through both PC and mobile channels. Thus, the full expense (marketing, technology, etc.) of scaling this business was reflected in the Q3 numbers, but most of the revenue generated during that time period will show up in Q4 and the number of hotels in existing markets and number of markets is increasing substantially week to week, making it more likely that hotel revenue will be ramping at an increasing rate throughout Q4.Thus, the recently reported third quarter reflected the increased marketing spend and technology costs of the new hotel booking engine, but much of the corresponding revenue will not be recognized until the fourth quarter. Q3 was the first full quarter the online hotel booking was offered on the full (PC and mobile) Travelzoo platform, so the next quarter will be the first report to show that increase in revenue. Perhaps of more concern to those betting against Travelzoo is that the number of online bookable hotel offers being promoted has increased significantly during the fourth quarter, as our channel checks have indicated that sometimes four or more of the ""Top 20"" deals are being allotted to these online hotel booking deals vs. maybe one or two during Q3, suggesting that management is continuing to see the increased revenue per deal that management mentioned on the Q3 conference call. Also, it appears that the number of hotels participating has nearly tripled since the end of the third quarter, suggesting that founder Holger Bartel's stated goal in returning to the helm is picking up steam.Another reason short sellers should err to the side of caution here is this week's emergence of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) as an entrant into the online hotel booking business. Amazon has historically chosen to acquire their way into new verticals and Travelzoo's size and likely sales price range ($375m - $450m) fit squarely within the range of previous Amazon acquisitions. Amazon's entry comes just a few weeks after two of its most significant online competitors took steps to pursue the online travel segment more heavily - (1) Groupon (NASDAQ: GRPN) disclosed nearly $1 billion in TTM gross travel sales and recently announced the launch of its first standalone app for online travel (mostly hotel) deals(2) Alibaba (NASDAQ: BABA) closed multiple travel deals in the months leading up to its IPO and then made the first use of its IPO proceeds the purchase of a 15% stake in a Chinese hotel reservation technology firm to build out its Taobao Travel operationsWe believe Travelzoo's unique assets would be very attractive to Amazon, Groupon and Alibaba; all three of whom have the means to do an accretive deal at more than double the current Travelzoo price. We would not be surprised at all to see a bidding war evolve should one of the three make an offer to acquire Travelzoo.In summary, traders who have profited from the Travelzoo short trade over the last year should book their profits and consider going long. The potential for additional price declines from these levels is very low in light of the historical trading range, the company's strong (zero debt/$57 million cash) balance sheet and what will be a substantially improved operating performance when the hotel booking revenue begins to hit the income statement in Q4. The new short interest report released after the close on Tuesday showed over 515,000 of TZOO's shares sold short. This is very large in the context of TZOO's free trading (non insider or institution held) float of just 1.4m shares and against a backdrop of much lower daily trading volumes than what have historically changed hands on a daily basis, meaning that it will take a fairly significant period of time for this short position to be unwound. Speculators choosing to stay short in the face of the new facts emerging here this week are playing with fire and may want to look more closely at those 2004 and 2011 charts and consider the degree to which they can get burned."

While the stock was cratering into the mid 8's, it appears that institutional investors continued to buy shares, with both Osmium Capital and Blackrock boosting their stakes to 5%+ positions. On Tuesday after the close we learned of the 30% (up to 378,000 shares) jump in the short interest that occurred in the days following the Q4 earnings call as the stock fell lower. Thursday morning's announcement that Expedia (Nasdaq: EXPE) is buying Orbitz (NYSE: OWW) just 20 days after they completed the purchase of Travelocity makes one thing abundantly clear - the big online travel agencies take the threat of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) very seriously and they have no intention of letting them buy up travel assets or employees on the cheap. With TZOO being one of the only independent publicly traded companies with attractive online travel assets that can be had for less than $3 billion, the implications of the rapid fire take down of Travelocity and Orbitz are significant for shareholders as many see Travelzoo as the most likely candidate to be acquired next and the potential for such a deal has started to be reflected in the trading of Travelzoo shares in the two days since that announcement.Travelzoo owns a very attractive collection of online travel assets, in particular its strong consumer brand with a reputation for finding deals/value, its 24 million subscribers whose travel purchases have led travel suppliers to pay nearly $150 million per year to access them, long standing relationships with travel suppliers, a growing hotel booking business, the under-utilized but high potential fly.com and an option to acquire Travelzoo Asia.Much has been written about the negative aspects of Travelzoo's fourth quarter report, with most highlighting commentary about the company's hotel booking business and essentially dismissing it as a failed effort. Our takeaway from the call was that the company was finding it more challenging than expected to build out the content - to find deals for great properties that reflected big enough discounts to excite consumers. However, we note that in comments on the previous quarterly call, (Bartel's first call since reassuming the position of executive chairman) he spoke to this very issue in saying that building out the content of the hotel offering was their primary focus. That was in November, so in discussing the company's results for a period ending about 45 days later, its not surprising that those numbers reflect that endeavor as a work in progress. What investors should not miss is the exchange in the Q&A, where Mr. Bartel states plainly - ""the margins in this business are just tremendously large. There's very few industries that you see that have such attractive margins. So I think it's an area where it is very attractive to play in the long-term."". This management team gets it - the online hotel booking business can and will transform this company and while that does not happen overnight, it is happening before our eyes. In the several weeks since other comments from that call were published and widely accepted as evidence of the company's retreat from hotel booking (and the unsurprisingly negative impact on Travelzoo's stock price), we have closely watched each of the Top 20 deals, each newsletter release and the Travelzoo website for any indication of a pullback in listings with the new hotel booking service or other evidence of retrenchment. Not only has there been no pullback, we have seen a significant increase in the number of deal listings that are on the hotel booking platform vs. the old model's Getaways offers and direct links to hotel websites. Those who are suggesting the hotel booking business is a failed endeavor and are making their TZOO buy/sell decision based on this should take a closer look, as Travelzoo's hotel booking business appears to be growing rapidly based on the number of deals they are offering, particularly in light of the fact that each hotel booking deal inserted into the top 20 newsletter takes the place of an advertiser who on average would pay more than $50k to be inserted in that slot.Travelzoo's core business working with travel suppliers to place advertisements continues to perform well. When asked about the core business, TZOO CEO Loughlin said ""The model that we've been operating with the tour operators and many of the large brands, I mean, hotel brands still advertise with us directly......that's not changing at the macro level. In fact if anything it's getting stronger. But in the last three months I've been out to meet plenty of the advertisers and I'm very confident in that side of the house.""Meanwhile, the macro picture for the company's business has improved significantly over the months that the stock fell from the low 20's to the 8's. Many companies stand to benefit from lower gas prices, but few to the degree of Travelzoo. While the decrease in gas prices should be a boon to online travel companies generally, Travelzoo's focus has always been in the leisure travel segment and within that a particular strength has been in the regional ""drive to"" markets, so we are expecting the decrease in gas prices to have a disproportionately positive affect. Additionally, we note that the seasonality factor for many of the top leisure markets in the U.S. results in the prime booking season running from March through August. Any efforts towards growing the hotel booking business would only be expected to have a marginal impact on results during October through December, months where WEEKLY booking revenue often falls below what can be booked on certain DAYS during the prime booking season. So as we see signs of the company ramping its hotel business, we note that investors are going to get their first real picture of the potential for this business when TZOO's results reflect what is booked between March and August of 2015. Thus, Travelzoo is heading into the seasonally best period for the business they are trying to grow at a time when gas prices nationwide are in some cases one half of what they were this time last year when Travelzoo was trading in the $24 range.The technical picture for Travelzoo has shifted dramatically. TheStreet.com as recently as two weeks ago had been among the most bearish on TZOO shares and they are now highlighting the double bottom formation and reversal this past Thursday, where they noted that big volume on a move like Thursday's gains in the following session on big volume will likely cause the stock to trade up to test and possibly take out the next resistance levels in the $11.50 range.In summary, we believe management's comments on the earnings call were not indicative of a retreat from the hotel booking business or of Travelzoo's demise generally, but rather a very positive indication that they get how competitive but lucrative the hotel booking business is and that they will redouble their efforts to execute in that niche. We see very real evidence that this is occurring with the significant uptick in deals offered on that platform. The company's hotel booking business is obviously growing and we believe they will achieve the critical mass necessary for success at a time (seasonally) that will allow it to have a material impact on Travelzoo's top and bottom lines within 60-90 days. The fact that this is occurring at a time when gas prices are running close to one half what they were a year ago when Travelzoo was trading north of $22 means that economic conditions have become much more favorable for Travelzoo's business generally. The dark cloud of Travelzoo's decade long free stock saga (a period that saw two runs from $8 to $100 for Travelzoo) is over. The acquisition of Orbitz leaves Travelzoo as the last publicly traded independent online travel company of significance that could be acquired for less than $3 billion at a time when there is huge capital competing to consolidate the space and Travelzoo is trading near historical lows. All of these factors lead us to be very bullish on the outlook for Travelzoo shares over the course of 2015. This week we would not be surprised to see Travelzoo's advance continue as several new kinds of buyers emerge to get a piece of Travelzoo's smallish public float - including value investors who have been watching and waiting for the sense that the knife is no longer falling, funds who invested in Orbitz as an acquisition target who will leave a few cents on the table for the arbs to put their capital to work in the next likely takeover target, technicians playing the move off the double bottom, traders playing the potential short squeeze and the short sellers looking to cover or at least box their part of the reported 378,000 share short position in light of Travelzoo's history of punishing short sellers.Travelzoo is long from dead and we believe the outlook for investor gains in 2015 is very good for investors who can look ahead instead of focusing on the rear view mirror. Investors buying in the current range with a long term investment horizon should have an opportunity book strong double digit gains and possibly more. The potential for significant short term gains is quite likely too if Blackrock, Osmium or other institutional investors get aggressive or if some on the list of new buyers above moves to take down any significant percentage of the dwindling public float of Travelzoo shares."
2868536,77545,2015-01-31T09:32:51-05:00,"TZOO's growth strategy revolves around a new hotel booking platform.When tested in 2014, the platform didn't perform well.Management was gloomy on 2015 outlook - so should investors.","Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) is a website in transition. In the past, Travelzoo was known for curating travel deals online and presenting them to customers via the company's Top 20 List and e-mail marketing. However, that strategy only targets a segment of the overall market and Travelzoo believes it can grow with a new strategy.TZOO plans to grow by developing more ""pull"" type offers on its website instead of ""push"" deals. In other words, TZOO wants users to come to the website and search for hotels and flights that meet their own travel needs rather than the company push deals to them via e-mail or other promotional methods that the user may not want. Makes sense, considering most people I know travel based on need/desire rather than because of a hot deal.To meet the on-demand needs of its customers, Travelzoo is in the process of developing and rolling out a hotel booking platform on the Travelzoo website that would be similar to what competitors already offer. During initial tests last year to a select number of users, management recently reported on the results of those tests:One of the biggest challenges Travelzoo is presented with is there are dozens of competitors already with hotel booking websites/apps. Many of those websites/apps work incredibly well, so users have high standards for these websites. The feedback from Travelzoo explains exactly what was wrong with the company's hotel booking platform:In summary, TZOO's growth strategy is centered around this new hotel booking platform - but once tested, it basically flopped on all accounts. Travelzoo paid to develop and test the failed launch of the hotel booking platform - and will now have to pay for the subsequent redesigns and testing again in 2015. All this spending on a product that you could argue has been perfected by many of TZOO's competitors already.Chart: Google FinanceSpeaking of TZOO's competitions - over the last 12 months, TZOO has underperformed all the major competitors in the online travel space including, Orbitz (NYSE:OWW), TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), Priceline (PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE).To stand out in this space you need to either spend a tremendous amount on mainstream marketing like Priceline has, or develop a differentiating reason to come to the travel website. Websites like TripAdvisor draws users in with customer reviews and a site like Hotels Tonight targets the last minute overnight traveler. Travelzoo is known for its curated Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) like business model and will likely generate revenues from this advertising model for some time. However, the shift into hotel booking, without a specific niche or massive ad budget, means Travelzoo will struggle to find areas of growth and will have to spend increasingly more on customer acquisition/marketing in order to gain any marketshare.From the outside Travelzoo appears to be a website that is struggling with its identity and that weakness is carried throughout the company. In a presentation given to investors during the latest quarterly earnings last week - TZOO basically sums up the poor performance this company has demonstrated over the last year.Company Presentation (Slide 12)Kudos to TZOO management for being honest that revenues are down, member acquisition costs are up and a slow moving failed product launch is costing the company. On top of all that, a weak Euro is hurting the company as well.But it's management's honesty about the future that should have current TZOO shareholders concerned as well:That's enough to get me to pass on Travelzoo shares as there will likely be more pain before gains in this stock. But before we write TZOO off for good, let's take a deeper look.Business ModelThe company operates under three divisions. Travel includes advertising sales on the website and commission sales on the voucher and hotel booking side. Search encompasses the company's SuperSearch and Fly.com search engines that earn payments via clicks/referrals. Local includes daily deal like vouchers for restaurants and entertainment in a user's geographic area.Revenue2012 = $151,168,0002013 = $158,234,0002014 = $142,077,000Source: Company Presentation (Slide 25)All three business segments (travel, search and local) were down for the year with Search and Local each being down over 20% compared to 2013. One reason why revenue was down is the company is shifting from voucher sales, which are recognized as revenue when sold, to the hotel booking platform which only recognizes revenue when the hotel stay is completed.Another reason for lower revenue is the company is intentionally cutting back on its search engine ads; which indicates the ads were no longer converting at an acceptable rate, otherwise the company would keep running them. It also indicates the competition is fierce and the cost for clicks is only marginally profitable at best. Finally, I believe it's a sign that Travelzoo might be near capacity on a user's front. Sure, the site will likely continue to see subscriber growth but at a slower rate and at an increasing cost to the company.GAAP net income for the year came in around $1.25 million, which leaves very little wiggle room, and the chances of Travelzoo generating a negative net income for 2015 is possible.MarginsSource: Company Presentation (Slide 8)Revenues are declining and operating margin at TZOO is also declining. In order to generate higher margins, management has indicated that the hotel booking platform will again be the solution to the problem:In order to grow revenues and increase margins in 2015 - management believes the hotel booking platform will be the solution. However, upon testing, customer feedback was negative as competitors already have set a high bar in this space.Cash PositionWith a market cap around $135m today and a cash balance of nearly $55m ... some might argue that TZOO is undervalued because roughly 40% of its market cap is in cash.Source: Company Presentation (Slide 11)I never liked the argument to buy stock in any company, and especially TZOO, just because they have cash. Sure, having a healthy cash position is great, but the market needs to be convinced management will know what to do with that cash in order to apply a multiple in excess of that cash. If you want to invest in cash, just put some money in your bank account or buy some gold/silver. The broader market will invest in companies like TZOO for growth - not just because it has cash.I understand TZOO's cash level declined in part due to the weakening of the Euro currency in relation to US Dollars, but that's the risk you take with a company holding the majority of its cash outside the United States as TZOO does today. Additionally, TZOO would be subject to United States taxes if it were to repatriate any of its cash held overseas into the US - and this tax impact would need to be accounted for if you were simply valuing TZOO on the basis of cash.Either way, the market needs to be convinced TZOO's management will know what to do with the cash. So far, the only specific growth strategy centers around a hotel booking platform that the company admits was terrible upon launch. Now the company is going to invest more of this cash into a product that already got bad reviews and has major competitors already with popular offerings. It's no wonder why the market doesn't give much premium to TZOO's shares despite a somewhat healthy cash position.Customer AcquisitionAnother thing Travelzoo will be spending some of that cash on is a planned increase in customer acquisition costs.Source: Company Presentation (Slide 21)Management remarked on the last conference call that they won't be focusing on a sheer volume of users, rather it will focus on quality. That is why the increase in spend is planned because acquiring quality users is not easy or cheap when the rest of your competitors are fighting for the same customers.CustomersA website like Travelzoo actually has 2 different customers. Hotels, cruise lines, and airlines have to be attracted to pay to list its deals (or create unique deals) on the Travelzoo website. In turn, Travelzoo needs the general public to become consumers of the deals in order for it to be beneficial for everyone involved. If Travelzoo can't attract enough hotels to list good deals, the customers dry up and vice-versa. That is the challenge with the company's hotel booking engine. If enough hotels don't post listings, the users perceive the product as being weak and will shop elsewhere.This is one of the primary reasons Travelzoo has seen stagnate growth over the last few years. It becomes increasingly challenging to market Travelzoo to both the consumer and business - and the decline in one's usage will always directly affect the other.SubscribersA bullish investor might note the company's fairly sizable 27 million e-mail subscribers. That number of subscribers has value because acquiring such a list would take significant time and resources if you were to start from zero. However, to an existing travel website company, the value of this customer list is not nearly as valuable once you factor in overlap and inactivity. You have to imagine a decent percentage of subscribers to Travelzoo would also have signed up for Priceline or Expedia at some point as well. Additionally, open rates and engagement on an e-mail list so large is likely low, so the value to existing travel websites in a takeover bid would be muted.For Travelzoo to realize the full value of its subscriber list in a company sale, the buyer would have to be a relatively new player in the space. Given how competitive the travel website space is, I wouldn't anticipate many start-up type businesses developing from scratch in this space.Other ChallengesTravelzoo is centered around curating the best travel deals, and not necessarily every deal that is out there. While I respect that approach, I feel the user is capable of finding what hotel is right for them based on the information they find. Websites like TripAdvisor may have negative reviews on a property, however the site still gives me the option to book that hotel if I feel it's right for my needs. Instead of hiding or not offering the poor hotel, the company should present that knowledge (like TripAdvisor does) so it can inform its users and keep them from reviewing properties on competing sites. It appears the chairman of Travelzoo uses TripAdvisor himself for this very reason:Travelzoo's strategy to only show good deals and quality properties goes against the grain of what a user is typically looking for in a hotel booking platform. Additionally, while Travelzoo claims to be ""The Deal Experts"" on its website, someone new to the site might have no idea Travelzoo is only curating the best deals on its site and just assume it has less to offer than competitors. A cleaner strategy would be to offer up the curated reviews of all properties and let the user decide if it's worth it to them.One of the main things I don't like about the online booking website business model is that it can be a window-shop environment where travelers search for the deals online, but then go directly to the hotel/destination website to secure the same, or in some cases, a better deal. Travelzoo runs the risk of its users window shopping the deals only to book the same deal elsewhere.TakeoverI hate investing in a company where one of the best possible outcomes is a sale of the company. It's possible given the cash on the balance sheet and customer list Travelzoo has acquired over the years that it could be a takeover target by another competitor - but there's no guarantee you will realize much of the benefit as a shareholder.ValuationI believe the market isn't out of line with its valuation of Travelzoo, which means there's almost no upside given management has already guided for a flat/down 2015. Factor in a weakening European economy/currency, and TZOO's slide could be amplified in 2015. If management proves it can roll out a compelling hotel booking platform and revenue begins to trend up, that's when TZOO could become a compelling buy, but with the information we have today, that is at least 1 year away from materializing.ConclusionsTravelzoo's core product is weak and the company is struggling to find new ways to spur growth. Given all the other attractive options in the market, TZOO doesn't make an attractive investment."
3334295,24663,2015-07-17T13:08:18-04:00,"TZOO fell nearly 20% after reporting second quarter earnings.However, it added another 900,000 plus new members.Its revenue losses in constant currency continue to improve.TZOO should return to revenue growth soon and is priced very cheap.","It's no secret that Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) will never be a threat to Priceline (PCLN) or Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE). However, that doesn't mean there isn't a niche market for Travelzoo, demand for its services or a price at which the stock becomes valuable for investors.Travelzoo's stock fell over 19% on Thursday in response to earnings, leading investors to think that its quarter was actually bad. Yes, Travelzoo's revenue fell 7.5% to $34.1 million, and yes, its EPS of $0.09 was one penny shy of expectations. However, investors must remember that 30% of Travelzoo's revenue came from Europe, and while that revenue declined 12% year-over-year, it was actually up 1% in constant currency.Albeit, Travelzoo is not going to explode with growth anytime soon, and despite having revenue of just over $135 million during the last 12 months, Travelzoo's business is now more about optimization. For a small company, Travelzoo is nothing that I would usually explore or even consider as a good investment. However, there's a place for deals in general, and I find it particularly encouraging that Travelzoo added 950,000 new members for a grand total of 24.8 million in the second quarter. That's a pretty significant platform. Now if Travelzoo can just monetize that user base it will be ok.So, will Travelzoo return to growth, and is it a good investment? As for the former, Travelzoo has added nearly two million new members during the last two quarters alone, and has invested in a number of new technologies ranging from social media deals and a hotel booking platform that allows users to book on any device. Beyond that, Travelzoo is still creating packaged deals from dining, travel, entertainment and hotel. The idea is if Travelzoo can continue to grow its member base, provide good deals, increase marketing and provide new options for booking then revenue per member will rise. If you look at Travelzoo's performance in constant currency over the last year, it appears the company's plan is working.Clearly, Travelzoo is seeing some improvements, stability that could add to revenue growth in future quarters. Another thing to consider is that Travelzoo's revenue recognition for hotels has changed. In the past, 100% of revenue was recognized at the time of a member booking a hotel. Today, revenue from hotel bookings is not recognized until redeemed at the hotel, and Travelzoo claims that 15% of bookings are not redeemed until a future quarter. This is a new program that correlates with the company's new hotel booking platform, so the fact that revenue losses in constant currency have shrunk by such a large degree is really impressive.In other words, Travelzoo's changes and philosophy will likely result in year-over-year revenue growth in the near future, probably 2016. In a market that struggles to look six months into the future, that outlook may not seem promising. However, the stock is trading at just 11x earnings, very cheap for a company that sports a $150 million market capitalization and that used to be a $1 billion company.Nevertheless, once a stock starts to tumble, it can take a while for sentiment to change. I'm not saying that TZOO will recover tomorrow, or even next month. Instead, I am noting that there is a niche market for the company, one where nearly 25 million members search for packaged deals. In many ways, Travelzoo is like a mini-Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), and considering the consolidation that has occurred in the online travel space, and even Groupon's own desire to grow in online travel, I think Travelzoo makes an intriguing acquisition target due to its member base and valuation. In other words, Travelzoo is a company to keep an eye on as its fundamental performance isn't as bad as it seems and is a company that should have better days ahead.See how Travelzoo compares to other stocks in Tipping the Scale, and which top rated stocks have far more upside."
2183563,23479,2014-05-01T16:33:20-04:00,,"Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) is a leading global Internet media company that allows travel, entertainment and local businesses to market and sell their services to its vast 26 million subscriber base. With the introduction of the hotel booking option on its websites this year in March, the company has marked a shift from its existing business model. The hotel booking platform enables users to book hotels directly via Travelzoo’s website or through mobile products, thus also allowing suppliers to promote deals in a more flexible manner; e.g. loading a last minute rate for a hotel has become much easier compared to Travelzoo’s previous solution, which redirected users to the hotel’s website.The hotel feature benefits all the three nodes in the ecosystem—the hotel, the user and Travelzoo. Here’s why the product is advantageous for each of them:1.) The User: The platform benefits users in four ways. First, they can now book rooms in 500 plus hotels at anytime of the year. Earlier, they could not choose where and when they wanted to go, and had to accept the places and dates that were offered to them by Travelzoo. Second, they can book full-price hotels with the service. Earlier, users could not book full-price hotel stays because Travelzoo offered only discounted deals on certain hotels. Third, the platform has made booking via mobile much easier since the booking is completed on Travelzoo’s website itself and users are not redirected to the hotels website, which sometimes creates hand-off issues. And fourth, users do not have to tackle the hassle of always buying vouchers. (Sources: First Quarter 2014 Performance and Growth Strategy Overview; Travelzoo's CEO Discusses Q1 2014 Results - Earnings Call Transcript)2.) The Hotel: Many hotels could not participate on Travelzoo either because they were unable to operate under the voucher model or they did not want to run advertisements for discounted deals, but preferred a commission based model for transactions. With the launch of the platform, hotels have the option of selling full-price stays under the commission based model. Hence, it enables them to make more business compared to the earlier solution which gave them scope to sell only off-season deals for one to four weeks in a year.3.) Travelzoo: Prior to the introduction of the platform, Travelzoo was unable to take advantage of the peak season demand since it only offered off-season deals. Hotel prices are much higher during peak seasons than in off-seasons, and thus also generate higher commissions. Further, many hotels used to limit advertising activity since their budgets are fixed. For instance, a hotel in New York would only advertise in the Northeast United States. The booking platform is attractive to such advertisers since they can choose to pay commissions instead of paying advertising fees to Travelzoo.Results From The Beta Test Are EncouragingTravelzoo’s hotel booking platform is currently available to VIP members only. The company has introduced about 200,000 members to the hotel platform. Of the subscribers who booked during the test period 84% had never purchased a Getaway deal on Travelzoo in the past. The Getaway deals usually include a night or two at a hotel or resort within a two-hour drive or short flight from subscribers’ homes and include a fine dining experience or resort credit, plus other extras. Travelzoo’s robust growth in its hotel business so far has been primarily driven by the launch of its Getaway hotel offering in 2011.Many other metrics suggest that the hotel platform is a good bet. First, the average hotel-related revenue per subscriber for the one-month test period was $54, about 300% higher than the full-year average for 2012 and 2013. Second, of all hotels booked via the platform 46% were full-priced deals. And third, 56% of the participating hotels had not run any deals on Travelzoo before the platform’s launch because they were unable to operate under the voucher or advertising model.We believe that Travelzoo’s entry in hotel bookings is a good long-term strategy as it opens up an additional revenue opportunity for the company. Additionally, the platform could help stabilize the decline in take rates that the company has been witnessing for the past several quarters. For a detailed analysis of the benefits of the hotel platform, read our article: Travelzoo’s Hotel Booking Feature Can Help Drive Big Growth.Our price estimate of $21.33 for Travelzoo marks our valuation at a premium of over 15% to the market price of the stock.Disclosure: No positions"

This is called the gap.Many times, the market reacts too aggressively to negative news or results. In the short term, the stock becomes oversold, selling below a reasonable fair value even after accounting for the negatives. Over the course of a few weeks or months, the stock will often slowly rise to ""fill the gap"" that it lost so rapidly.But we also have to be careful, because there are plenty of instances when negative news really does affect the long-term earnings potential of a company, warranting a sell-off and reducing the likelihood of a gap fill. It is also possible that the stock was overvalued in the first place, and the gap simply brought the valuation back to earth.One such dramatic decliner in the MFI screens is Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO), down about 25% over the past month. Can it get back to the $24 level in the near term? Let's take a look.What Does Travelzoo Do?Travelzoo is a publisher of travel sales and specials. The company's primary assets are its Travelzoo websites, the Top 20 newsletter, the Newsflash e-mail alerts service, a few travel-based search engines (SuperSearch and Fly.com), and more recently, the Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN)-like services Local Deals and Getaways, which provide discounted products or services from local spas, hotels, and restaurants. Clients such as airlines, rental car companies, hotels, restaurants, and travel agents pay Travelzoo advertising fees to list their offerings on their Internet-based platforms. The company has over 2,000 clients and has over 24 million subscribers and website visitors. Europe accounts for about 27% of revenues with North America making up the rest.The value proposition is compelling. To its customers, Travelzoo offers airlines, cruise lines, and hotels a way to liquidate unused inventory quickly and at low cost. To consumers, Travelzoo offers significantly cheaper means to travel.Why Did the Stock Plummet?For many years, Travelzoo was a high-flying growth stock. From 2004 through 2011, the company averaged 32% revenue growth annually, raising revenues from $34 million to $150 million.Times have changed. In the past two years, Travelzoo has posted unimpressive revenue increases of 1.9% and 4.7%. In the most recent quarter, they posted a year-over-year decline of 4.7% and are expected to be negative for the full year. Margins are also falling, from almost 24% in 2011 to under 15% this year.Right now, Travelzoo's business model just looks worn. The real difficulties are in the Search and Local units, where sales are declining rapidly (over 20% year-over-year). Local deals have little long-term potential, in my opinion. There is now an unbelievable amount of competition, not only from Groupon but also from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), LivingSocial, and dozens of others. Not only that but consumers are fatigued on the voucher model, and deals that are no longer that enticing.Can Travelzoo Turn It Around?Travelzoo has one ongoing initiative that has real potential to make a difference. The company launched the initial phase of its hotel booking platform in late March, now allowing direct booking from its websites (before, they simply provided vouchers, like a coupon site).This is big for a couple of reasons. One, the voucher fatigue that we described earlier also applies to the travel business - consumers just were not using them like they used to. Second, being able to book hotel rooms through Travelzoo sites allows the company to participate in full-priced business, allowing them to operate successfully in peak season (where unused inventory is low). Third, it opens Travelzoo's sites up to higher-end hotels that disliked operating only in a discount environment.The company is seeing good early results. During the test period, the company was earning $54 in revenue from customers utilizing the booking platform, vs. an average $13 through the voucher model. Management expects to start seeing revenue contribution as early as next quarter, and a wider rollout is planned for later this year.Potential Upside Still Looks LimitedDespite the promise of the hotel booking engine, I still want to be careful on assuming a dramatic turnaround. Booking is the ""bread-and-butter"" business of competitors like Booking.com, Priceline (PCLN), Hotels.com, Kayak, Hotwire, and a bunch of others. Travelzoo is coming in late to a very competitive market, and it will be difficult building a foothold. Additionally, growth from the booking business will be battling against continued declines from Local and Search, and a flattening out travel voucher business.Ultimately, I expect reasonable success from Travelzoo over the next several years, projecting 10% annual earnings growth. The market has assigned about a market-average multiple to the stock for the past few years, which I expect to continue. Given all of this, I see TZOO as worth about $20/share, upside of about 15%. However, the volatility in valuations for travel stocks does present the potential for much higher stock prices then this should the booking business take off.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2549805,25432,2014-10-10T07:00:00-04:00,"Travelzoo is rolling out a new hotel booking platform that could provide much needed revenue growth.Ralph Bartel, Travelzoo's founder, and brother Holger Bartel are taking a more active role in the company.The company has its challenges, but Travelzoo has a strong balance sheet with net cash and a large and growing customer base.Travelzoo reports Q3 earnings on October 16, 2014.","Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) is a global internet media company which sources and provides users with deals on travel, entertainment and local events. The company boasts over 27 million subscribers in North America and Europe across its various web platforms.Travelzoo earns revenue primarily through advertising and listing fees from its partners who sell through Travelzoo's portals. Travelzoo, in turn, features a capital-light operating model with ~90% gross margins and little ""inventory"" risk.However, Travelzoo has faced headwinds in its core businesses the last couple of years. Most recently, Travelzoo reported two straight quarters of year/year sales declines from a heightened competitive environment for online travel advertising and execution issues. The share price reflects this backward-looking situation.TZOO data by YChartsWhile Travelzoo is profitable ($0.84 non-GAAP EPS through the half-year, or $1.68 annualized) due to its high-margin selling model, the share price has been on a downward trajectory due to growth concerns. Yet, the business is well capitalized with ~$60 million net cash on the books as of Q2 on a market capitalization of $230 million ($170 million EV) and plans to reinvigorate growth through a new hotel booking platform.New Growth Platform: Full Price Hotel BookingsHistorically, Travelzoo acted as a web destination to book deeply discounted travel and entertainment. This, of course, requires Travelzoo to source deals from travel partners and only allows users to select from a limited set of offerings. Travel partners, in turn, only advertise travel deals with Travelzoo in off-peak times to fill capacity. In peak season, travel partners have little incentive to publish discounted offers since capacity is filled at higher prices. By only offering discounted fares and tickets, Travelzoo's revenue growth faced a bottleneck without peak season offers to sell.To that end, Travelzoo's revenue is derived from its customer base and average revenue per customer.(Source: Travelzoo Q2 Earnings Presentation)To capture additional revenue from Travelzoo's large and growing customer base, the company has been testing and rolling out a new hotel booking platform to select users. The new platform will feature full price listings under a commission revenue model rather than a voucher system and/or advertising fee's.On the Q2 earnings call, CEO Christoper Loughlin stated with respect to the hotel booking platform (transcript courtesy of Seeking Alpha):During the beta launch, average revenue per transaction was $54 versus $13 under the voucher/advertising format. I understand customers and hotel partners found the voucher system quite difficult to understand which impeded adoption and, ultimately, revenue growth. The new booking platform should be more user-friendly and should drive wider adoption and commission revenue.Given the larger average ticket for Travelzoo under the new hotel booking platform, further adoption among its customer base could lead to a significant new commission revenue stream as Travelzoo ramps up awareness among its customer base and hotel partners. There is clearly a long runway to ramp this business as the system has only been rolled out to 2.5% of the customer base so far and while Travelzoo aggressively signs up new hotel partners.Note that under the commission selling model Travelzoo records revenue when the hotel stay occurs usually 40 to 50 days in advance, not when the transaction is consummated on the platform. Over time this should not impact the valuation, but could cause some specious timing issues for revenue recognition in the short-term.Company Founders Take More Active RoleRecently, the company quietly filed an 8-K which indicated a shakeup at the management level which features Ralph and Holger Bartel returning to more active management of the business. In the short-term, the executive management restructuring portends headwinds (why else would they install themselves?); however, in the longer-term, I believe the Bartel's are solid managers who can steer Travelzoo back to more firm footing and to drive growth. They have the economic incentive to do so with a combined 50.4% equity stake in the business.ValuationTravelzoo is currently trading for about 1.5x EV/Sales which is cheap when considering this is a business that can achieve ~30% operating margins when it is firing on all cylinders. It is also a wide discount to publicly-traded comparables such as Priceline (PCLN) and M&A takeout multiples (Priceline bought Kayak.com for 6x sales and 45x earnings). Granted, Travelzoo has not executed nearly as well as the comps in this space, but there is still a runway for share price appreciation with renewed efforts on profitable growth. Given the small market capitalization (and EV) of Travelzoo coincident with its valuable customer base, I think the company could become an attractive acquisition candidate given online travel advertising is an industry in consolidation.ConclusionTravelzoo's share price is painting the picture that Travelzoo's growth story is over. Because of that, investors are not paying up for any growth prospects at current levels and are well protected due to an underlying business model which is high-margin with underappreciated growth opportunities via the new hotel booking platform.That said, the recent reconstitution of the management team seems to indicate the business underperformed again in the quarter suggesting the share price could remain under pressure in the near-term. In my view, under the helm of the Bartel's, Travelzoo could return to a growth story in 2015 when the hotel booking platform is expected to be rolled out to the entire customer base. However, until investors get more clarity on the growth prospects for Travelzoo, shares could remain dead money.If you are looking for a deal, Travelzoo's share price might just be the place to start looking. However, investors waiting for certainty in future growth prospects may see the sale end on Travelzoo shares before they realize it."

The company has $61 million in net cash on its balance sheet, representing 24% of the market cap ($200 million enterprise value).TZOO data by YChartsWhile the Travelzoo valuation has become much more undemanding following the rout in its share price after reporting underwhelming Q1 results, management provided a pre-earnings ""tell"" to investors when it announced it replaced certain executives in its Search & Local business due ""to continued weakness in the company's local voucher sales and declining search revenues.""Those are not the kind of words that induce animal spirits. That said, the current valuation reflects low expectations which could be easily surpassed as Travelzoo works on new growth initiatives, including a new hotel booking platform.In my view, the management shake-up indicates that while the Local & Search business is struggling, management is attempting to right the ship with new managers. Over the longer term, I think this investment idea can work given the undemanding valuation. But I do think there are near-term risks, that can continue to put downward pressure on the share price.The BusinessTravelzoo is a global internet media company whose business is primarily to offer third-party travel and entertainment deals to customers online. The business is comprised of three segments: (1) Travel; (2) Search; and (3) Local.While Search & Local continue to struggle, they collectively represent a minority of the revenue base, or about 38% (using full-year 2013 numbers for the proportion).(Source: 2013 10-K)Travelzoo's partner network is comprised of over 2,000 companies who use the site as a listing service to offer deals to consumers and Travelzoo's 23 million member newsletter user base.Travelzoo's value proposition is essentially to allow partners to sell excess inventory in order to generate incremental revenue without alienating other customers (who may have paid a higher price for the same service). Travelzoo's revenue model, therefore, is driven primarily from revenue shares with its travel partners, which management extrapolates using two variables: (1) subscriber base (23 million) and (2) revenue per subscriber.Given the headwinds in the business are being experienced in segments that make up a minority of the value proposition (Search & Local), I do think that investor fear is overblown with respect to Travelzoo's operating model.Yes, the competition is intense in the local deal space from Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and Living Social. Yes, there is some channel conflict as many hospitality businesses choose not to list with Travelzoo because Travelzoo generally only lists deeply discounted offerings (e.g., off season rates). Yes, barriers to entry are low for a businesses with the proper infrastructure to build a deal listing platform such as Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Yelp (NYSE:YELP) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). However, I do believe that the local deal market is large, fragmented and moving to a mobile format.To make up for the lackluster performance in Local & Search, Travelzoo is investing in a hotel booking platform which is Travelzoo's foray into ""non deal"" offerings. In my view, this will allow Travelzoo to compete for a wider array of listings, grow its subscriber base and to increase the annual revenue per subscriber.While the hotel booking platform has not been rolled out to a wide audience, ""beta testing"" among 200,000 select subscribers indicates that Travelzoo is generating $54 commission per booking, over a 300% increase from its ""deal only"" hotel platform. This, in my mind, is the ""variant view"" and the reason to consider a long-term investment in Travelzoo. The new anytime hotel booking platform will be rolled out to all subscribers on all devices in the second half of 2014, at which point prior-year comps will be easier to beat.Given the initial stats for the hotel booking platform investment, I believe this new business represents optionality on Travelzoo's shares, which currently trade at a distressed 1.25x EV/Sales for a scalable internet property which should generate operating margins in the low to high teens.ValuationThe large price dislocation experienced since last summer, indicates the market is not pricing in much optimism at Travelzoo. These are the exact situations I like to consider if I have a variant view and conviction.While revenue shrunk in the most recent quarter, I think growth is set to resume in the latter half of 2014 as Search & Local is stabilized, and as the hotel booking platform comes online which comes with higher commissions per subscriber, on average. Finally, the Travel segment, by itself, continues to exhibit strength on the back of strong European sales growth, up 26% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. Note that the European Travel segment makes up 35% of total Travel sales (based on 2013 proportions). That said, a European recovery and a growth jolt from the hotel booking platform in the second half of 2014 should propel sales higher.What is all of this worth? Competitors such as Orbitz (NYSE:OWW), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), Priceline (PCLN) trade at 10, 14 and 22x EV/EBITDA, respectively; meanwhile, Travelzoo trades at 7.5x. Similarly, the comps above trade at 1.5, 2, and 8.5x EV/Sales; meanwhile, Travelzoo is priced at 1.25x EV/Sales. Based on comps, Travelzoo is probably worth about 10x EV/EBITDA and 2x sales, suggesting about 30 to 60% upside. Yes, the value estimate is wide, but it is necessarily so given the moving parts at Travelzoo. If the Travel segment growth accelerates on the back of the hotel platform and continued European outperformance, that may prompt a re-rating in Travelzoo shares and optionality.In my view, while Travelzoo does face headwinds, the share price reflects very pessimistic expectations; expectations that will allow Travelzoo to surprise investors for the growth factors cited here. Downside risk is mitigated by the large net cash balance and the capital light operating model.ConclusionTravelzoo is an illustrative example that active investors would do well to heed management ""tells"" that indicate underperformance.While Travelzoo's valuation has come down considerably, there do appear to be near-term headwinds that could send shares down further in the Local & Search units. That said, based on the initial data points provided regarding the hotel booking platform, I do believe that over the long-term Travelzoo can right the ship.The good thing for prospective investors is that at this point, investors are taking less risk given the large price dislocation experienced in Travelzoo shares and the substantial cash balance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in TZOO over the next 72 hours.

(NASDAQ:TZOO) stock is reflecting well the pains of weak Search and Local business. Weak North American travel market, weak Getaways business, weak spending by airlines and weak local voucher business all contributed to the stock weakness. To make matters worse, EPS was negatively impacted by higher effective tax rates and investments in its upcoming hotels booking engine.Problems of these two businesses are somewhat due to underinvestment and lack of product innovation, but the following comments from Christopher Loughlin, CEO, in a recent conference call suggest that management seems to finally get it.Although the company has not been the most innovative in the space, a closer look at upcoming products and functionalities suggest that momentum may turn in the coming months and quarters. Some of the more promising catalysts may beThe stock should gain from an improved revenue and earnings outlook. Growth estimates, even conservative ones, of the upcoming hotel booking engine and consistent subscriber growth, helped by mobile offering, point to a materially improved growth outlook. Earnings, negatively impacted by weak revenues and increased investments in new products, should also benefit from top line growth and better operating margins.Search and Local business are bad, but things should turn from hereLooking at the stock's performance or the valuation, the market has clearly given up on the company, but the problems are manageable and some of the steps underway should address some of these growth related issues.The Problem: As the chart below shows, a closer look at the revenue reveal that weakness can mainly be attributed to the weak Search and Local business.Source: Travelzoo Inc.Search business, especially in North America, has been in a secular decline with customers moving to mobile, increased competition and rising acquisition costs among other factors. Non-availability of any mobile solution for SuperSearch or any App for Fly.com has added to the company's revenue growth problem.Solutions are underway: Biggest acknowledgement of the problems is the new management in place for both Search and Local businesses. For Search, David White, who recently joined from Yahoo (YHOO), is working on strategy to drive growth. As the traffic shifts to mobile, it offers Travelzoo a window of opportunity to gain an edge and some easy pickings might be to launch a mobile offering for SuperSearch, Apps for Fly.com and travel offerings using exact date, all of which are under development.Similarly, Michael Stitt, who was instrumental in bringing Local business to Travelzoo, is back in the driver's seat for that business. Like other players in the industry, including Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), the company is also working on to change the format of the voucher. Overall, the industry is suffering from poor revenues and moving from Push model to Pull model of marketing discount vouchers (where the customer looks for a deal based on specific date etc.), rather than the company pushing for specific vouchers or deals.Getaways, which grew at 40% after few quarters of its launch does instill confidence in the company's ability to launch a successful offering. Mobile version of Fly.com processed 750k search queries in its first full quarter of operation. Expect Travelzoo to benefit from date searchable deals, reviews and search functionality on its properties.Hotel booking is a potential game changer, in terms of growthThe new hotel booking engine is set to launch this year, which should allow customers to search for deals based on a specific date, which was not the case earlier. The company has already offered early access to 200k subscribers and initial reports are encouraging. Over 84% of the subscribers who booked on the platform are new customers and paid full price for the booking. For Travelzoo, hotel revenue from these bookings jumped more than 400% on average from $13/subscriber (including advertising and voucher sale) in the previous two years to $54.Source: Travelzoo earnings presentationThe company is working on enhancing user interface, improving rates and adding more hotels. The product is expected to launch on all devices and platforms. Strategically, this should substantially expand the hotel's acceptance of the Travelzoo hotel offering, since hotels start to look it as a sales commission rather than an advertising fee and the company should be able to cater to the peak season demand as well.Competitively, the offering may stand somewhat in direct competition to Blink, which was acquired by Groupon last year. With increasing hotel rates and rising hotel cost per click prices, the timing seems perfect, since material revenue contribution from the offering should start to hit by the second half.High operating leverageEven though operating expenses are expected to stay high due to investments (development and marketing) in the upcoming hotel booking engine, but there is still high operating leverage in the model, which is somewhat typical of the industry.As the above estimates show, even at $10-15 million revenue contribution from these new products can do wonders for the earnings. Besides revenue, tapering of development costs and taxes should also help the EPS.Estimates are based on conservative estimates, so right to expect improvement from hereOther than North American Search and Local business, most businesses are doing relatively well. With the new hotel booking engine and other product launches discussed earlier, growth should come back in the coming quarters.As the worksheet above shows, street estimates may be proven short, even on a mild recovery. I highly encourage investors to do their own analysis, but for the estimates aboveWorth noting that there is very limited street coverage in the name.Management is conservative, but good custodians of cash for this marketLooking at the balance sheet, cash and active share repurchases, investors can doubt management's aggression in product development or acquisitions, but not the fiscal conservatism of the management. Part of it might be due to very high insider ownership.This conservatism is not getting any respect from the markets, which are fascinated by growth alone, but the low enterprise value attached to this solid franchise should drive value investor's interest.As the worksheet above shows, the current enterprise value per subscriber works to mere $8, which is close to the acquisition cost of new subscribers; so effectively investors are getting a profitable business with promising new products in the pipeline for next to nothing.ConclusionThe stock suffered as topline growth deteriorated and investors started to bake in risk of product irrelevance, while the market was fascinated with the growth. Launch of a new hotel booking engine and other features should help the company turn corner, financially and strategically. As the company, and industry, shifts from Push to Pull, Travelzoo has an advantage of a strong brand and huge subscriber base. Consistent share buybacks, large insider ownership, no expensive acquisitions and smart operating expense management may help the stock as the market looks beyond temporary growth dips. Target of $23-25 is based on 18-20 times this year's expected earnings plus cash.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

With a share price of just $17.09, the company has a market cap of $254M and an enterprise value of $197M, representing a EV/Revenue multiple of 1.26x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.51x. That is quite low for an Internet travel company and, while TZOO is a small player in the space, TZOO appears markedly undervalued relative to its public comps (data from Yahoo Finance, as of COB 4/21):With a database of 23.6 million e-mail subscribers, a popular and highly-rated smartphone app, and a focus on consumer discounts, Travelzoo can be thought of like a travel-focused version of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). In fact, its legacy ""local deal vouchers"" are very similar to the Groupon printable coupons (but for hotels instead of retail locations). However, Groupon has lower EBITDA margins and is still valued at 1.5x EV/Revenue and 27x EV/EBITDA.Travelzoo recently completed bringing a new booking engine online that will allow it to: With a current valuation of a mere 7.5x trailing EBITDA, it does not seem like a potential boost from the new booking engine is factored into the company's current valuation.Mobile commerce could be a positive driver for Travelzoo going forward. Their namesake mobile app has 4+ stars, as of 4/21, (a very good rating) on both iTunes and Google Play. More importantly, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), (NASDAQ:GOOGL) reports between 500k and 1M downloads, and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shows 611 ratings--implying that the app is being adopted by users. Even Expedia, a much larger competitor whose app has been selected as an ""editor's pick"" and is a ""top developer"" on Google Play, only has 5,000,000 - 10,000,000 downloads (~10-20x of TZOO). Industry leader Priceline's (PCLN) popular Android comparison shopping app Kayak also has only 5,000,000 - 10,000,000 downloads on Google Play. On balance, Travelzoo seems to be holding its own (relative to its size) in mobile adoption against much larger competitors.The last factor that might boost Travelzoo is industry cyclicality. The weak economic recovery has limited the growth of the domestic leisure travel market. However, according to the US Travel Association, the number of domestic leisure person-trips are expected to grow faster in 2014, 2015, and 2016 than the number of domestic business person-trips. While I could not find travel-specific data, the phenomenon of price-sensitive middle-class consumers cutting back, or trading down, on restaurant and retail spending is well-documented. Given Travelzoo's focus on price-sensitive consumers, TZOO is likely to disproportionately benefit if and when the recovery becomes more inclusive.Disclosure: I am long TZOO.

The company has some interesting catalysts moving forward over the next eighteen months, but they also have some issues of rising competition that the company has seemed to ignore that we believe will challenge past growth levels. In the article, we will talk about these catalysts and impediments to upside, put these into current valuations, price future upside, and create the risk/reward profile for TZOO. We will show that we believe upside is limited to 10-15% in the next twelve months with much of the catalysts priced into shares.Catalyst/ImpedimentsTravelzoo has two major catalysts that are going to provide potential upside but additionally a growing problem, and as we will show in our valuation section, these catalysts are only able to give slight upside, and we worry about the risk levels with some impediments. The two main catalysts that we see for Travelzoo are the company's development of hotel booking system and growth in Europe. The issues we see, though, are rising competition and little economic moats for TZOO.Let's start with the company's development of its hotel booking system. Growth has stalled for Travelzoo in the first half of 2013 as the company has taken the year focusing on developing its performance, mostly its hotel booking capabilities. For years, TZOO was growing as an e-mail-based deals company. The website and then mobile app were more of repositories that collected traffic that could lead to more e-mail generation. Yet, traffic has shifted. Mobile has become much more popular, and people are more interested in taking advantage of deals in present time versus waiting for e-mail. As that shift has taken place, the problem for the company was booking.When the company sources a deal themselves, the path to buying that deal is very easy. One finds a Local Deal or other deal sourced by TZOO, and they can easily buy right on the site. For most deals, however, it requires a lot of extra work, which cuts down on the company's success at converting potential customers into customers. Here are some screenshots of the two different experiences:In this scenario, which is a local deal, it is easy to book the deal. Yet, a large group of deals are not this simple, especially in some very lucrative areas like hotels, cruises, and vacation packages. Many of the hotels require extra work. For example:The majority of the deals, though, work like this. While this is not very complicated, it is not ideal. What if the person does not do it right away? What if they forget the directions? More likely, what if they are a first-time user, and on most other websites they can book direct…what will they think. Luckily, TZOO has realized that this is an issue, and they are working hard to launch hotel-booking software that will let users book hotels more easily. Here are comments from the company's CEO in the latest quarterly earnings call:The change in software will create a significantly higher amount of sales for TZOO, as the success rate of turning potential customers into actual customers will rise. For that reason, we believe the company is going to have a very high growth rate again in the 2H of 2014 and 2015. Currently, the company has seen growth rates drop. In 2012, growth was only 2%, and in the TTM, it is about 3% over 2012. This problem has been highlighted as the main reason (we will discuss later if this is in fact the case) for some of these growth issues. The drop in advertising revenue and lower take rates at the company will be battled with the catalyst. Trefis has done a great job of detailing out the new booking platform here. What they haven't done is discuss what will it mean for actual revenue/earnings growth.How much growth can this catalyst provide?The growth will be slow at first as it will be a small group of hotels launched late this year and at first only to VIPs, but as time goes on, we expect more hotels to come on and the platform to be available to more people. One thing the move will do is increase margins. The company will have a fixed cost of development, and then once the platform is in place be able to attract higher fees from hotels, as the take rate will increase. Right now, the company has operating margins at around 14-18%, but they are variable. We would expect these margins to move up to 18-22% with the deal, which are very healthy levels. At worse, margins will stay at similar levels but volumes will increase as it brings in a whole new revenue stream.The development, additionally, will be a big help in mobile. As the user base moves more to mobile, the company needs a way to create more takes there. Before the company was easily able to get deals done as they pushed them to email, and the company would get takes on that. Now, the company is seeing issues with more focus on websites and mobile as well as rising competition (which will we will discuss). This development will help them in mobile as well, and if they can optimize that experience…growth will be sizeable as well. We do not expect, however, that we will see a lot of growth coming until 2014 as the company is still in test mode and should not launch the software in a larger front until 2014.Another major catalyst for TZOO is their European plans. In the last three months, the company launched their third office in Germany, and they are starting to make an imprint in the region. In the latest quarter, the company made $11M in revenue, which was 4% growth year/year and over 25% of the company. That rate continues to grow. The positive thing about Europe is that there is a lot of opportunity there - more than in the USA, due to several factors.First, the hotel business is fragmented in Europe. There are less major chains that can attract business to their own website. With less chains and more stand-alone businesses, they can use OTAs like TZOO for business. Travelzoo is working to close that gap, but they do face difficulties with a lot of already established European travel companies like trivago and Booking.com. Europe also is less developed than the USA in general Internet penetration and emerging markets in Eastern Europe. Europe only has a 60% Internet penetration rate, meaning that growth levels can outperform the USA in a pure volume standpoint. The company is established markets, though, with London, Manchester, Munich, Berlin, Hamburg, Barcelona, and Paris. Therefore, we would expect growth to be less than mid-single digits to high-single digits until they move into higher growth European areas like East Europe and Baltic areas.Europe, though, should go through a strong cycle of growth in 2014-2015. According to Travel Pulse:Therefore, TZOO moving into the established markets first make sense as the investment will pay off more quickly, but without higher growth markets, we should not expect anything more than double digit growth.With valuations definitely clearly resembling a growth stock (valuations covered later in article) at 20+ for PE and future PE, investors are already pricing in a lot of potential growth for the catalysts in the company. One impediment that we believe investors need to account for more, though, is the growing competition in travel deals and lack of economic moat. One of the main reasons for TZOO's slowdown is the growth of direct competition. Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), Priceline.com (PCLN), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), and many other competitors have created travel deal sections. Groupon has Groupon Getaways, and other voucher programs like Jetsetter and Vacationist also exist. The space is crowded for travel deals, and it should continue to grow. The company is taking steps to obviously differentiate it and provide catalysts, but the issue will continue to remain for TZOO. We believe that the company's ability to create an economic moat is nearly impossible, and they have to have great technology, effective marketing, and build strong relationships with clients and hotels to do this.We believe that continued competition will keep growth in check, and that the days of double-digit growth may be done. With that said, we want to put all of this in the context of value and pricing to show the risk/reward of the company as well as how much upside is left in shares with the current catalyst makeup.ValuationCurrently, TZOO is a fairly expensive stock. PE is at 24 and future PE is at 20. The company has price/sales at 2.7, and a quite high price/book over 8. As a growth stock, these rates are not extreme by any means, but we are questioning future growth in some respects. While the company has great catalysts in place, the actual success of their move into Europe and new software is questionable. The valuation appears to be close to fair value, as we will show in the following DCF analysis. The stock is currently priced as a growth name, so investors need to realize that in order to see higher prices, growth needs to be quite strong.Risk/RewardIn this section, we would like to establish a best-case scenario, worst-case scenario, and risk/reward profile for the name.Using a DCF analysis we can understand the pricing of the name with catalysts, risks, and downside involved. As we have noted, the company has strong catalysts for growth in its hotel booking model and European growth model. We believe that at its greatest level, the company has about 9% growth potential in 2014 and 2015 for Europe revenue. On the low end, we should expect around 5%. 2013 should bring in around $45M in European revenue. In the best-case scenario, we can expect around $50M in 2014 with up to around $66M in 2017. In a worst-case scenario we can expect mid-single digit growth, leading us to $55M in 2017.As for the hotel booking revenue, it is hard to say how much growth this could potentially bring in actual revenue/earnings. Current analyst estimates project around 7% growth in 2014 for the company, and we would expect around these levels of growth for domestic revenue for the company with the new features with downside to around 5% and upside to around 9%. Again, while we believe that the mobile plan is a catalyst, competition is also rising, which has hurt their growth in the past couple years. Domestic revenue should be at about $110M this year. Projecting that out on the worst-case side, we can expect around $130M in domestic revenue in 2017. On the flip side, the best-case scenario will expect around $155M.In total, we expect to see revenue between $175M and $210M in 2017. We also believe operating margins will improve. Costs are fixed for TZOO, and they should see margins expand beyond current levels. In the worst-case scenario, we see operating margins staying around the same level. With the company working on a new mobile model, volume and take up for deals should increase but costs will be the same. It's hard to imagine operating margins not improving.Operating income: In the worst-case, therefore, we should see operating income come in around $30M. In the best case, we should see operating income at $54M with around a 25% operating margin.Taxes: These levels should remain around 28%-30%.Depreciation: This should stay quite low as online companies have little depreciation on their assets. We can expect around $6M-$8M.Capital Expenditures: We expect these to continue to rise as the company will likely look to do acquisitions and share buyback programs. We can expect around $10M by 2017.Using a DCF model, using this information. In the best-case scenario, we can see TZOO as worth $31 per share. In the worst case, which is quite unlikely, we see TZOO as worth as around $18 per share. We believe $18 is the absolute worst for downside. That would only occur if TZOO was unsuccessful with their hotel booking model, and if the company was not able to continue their success in Europe. Yet, we see upside as limited and downside as risky.Therefore, those that want to invest in Travelzoo need to believe that 10% growth per year in total revenue will occur to get above the low-30s in share price.ConclusionWith TZOO seemingly pricing in a lot of its future growth, we can only recommend shares as a Hold. While we understand and agree with the catalysts in the stock, we believe that these catalysts are currently priced in and that the market has for the most part gotten it right. What we would be interested in seeing for potential upside from these targets is a very successful uptake of TZOO's European business and booking software. If that business can take off and we can see double-digit growth again in this name, then we can see a mid-30 to 40 range for upside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

1758642,23479,2013-10-21T19:05:09-04:00,,"Travelzoo Inc. (NASDAQ:TZOO), a leading global Internet media company that provides information on travel, entertainment and local deals, witnessed a seasonally low Q3 2013. Revenues were up 5% y-o-y to $37.3 million, although lower than $41.3 million earned in Q2. The company incurred a net loss of $19 million in Q3 2013 compared to a net profit of $3.5 million in Q3 2012 due to a one-time charge of $22 million related to a legal settlement over unclaimed property audits. Non-GAAP net income, which excludes the impact of the one-time charge, stood at $3 million.Travel revenue rose by 16% y-o-y driven by growth in certain vacation packagers and Getaway hotel deals both in North America and Europe. This remarkable performance by the travel division was offset by declines in search and local deals revenue. Search revenue dropped by 10% due to reduced spending on traffic acquisition, while local deals revenue fell 8% owing to a reduced number of local deals vouchers sold per deal and lower take rates. Travelzoo's stock plunged 10% post its earnings announcement.We believe Travelzoo's search division will gain stability as the company frees up resources from its new hotel booking platform and diverts them towards the search business. We also believe that the company's subscriber base will balloon as its audience engagement strategies generate repeat visits, referrals and higher conversion rates.Search Business To Improve Post Hotel Booking Platform Roll-OutTravelzoo's new hotel booking platform, which is due to be launched in 2014, has been demanding heavy capital investments as it is still in the development phase. The company incurred $800,000 on the hotel platform in Q3 2013. No revenue is being realized from the hotel platform presently and the beta-testing phase is expected to start beginning of 2014, with incremental revenue realization to occur in the late second half of the year.The need to balance investments has forced the company to reduce spending on search marketing, resulting in lower search revenue. We believe that search revenue could increase after the completion of the hotel platform roll-out as Travelzoo shifts its focus towards bolstering growth in the search business and increases its search marketing spend.Audience Engagement Strategies To Help Enhance Subscriber BaseGiven the nature of its products, Travelzoo has seen an increase in the audience accessing its services through mobile devices. Mobile now accounts for over 40% of its total traffic. The company's mobile iPhone and Android apps crossed 2.2 million downloads in Q3 2013. It also saw a record number of visits on social media with approximately 1.8 million combined Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) fans at the end of the quarter.Seeing the current trends Travelzoo has increased its focus on building its mobile and social audiences. It is working to lift consumer engagement levels by focusing on product development that will simplify ease of use and create better visual presentations. This was the primary motive behind the decision to build its own hotel booking platform as it will allow users to quickly and easily book hotels within Travelzoo's websites and mobile products. Travelzoo also updated its website last week to include subscriber localization, enhanced search function, Facebook comments, and user reviews and rating. This increased year-over-year subscriber activity on Travelzoo sites by 14%.We believe that such initiatives will help the company fuel audience growth, thereby boosting its top-line.We are in the process of updating our $24 price estimate for Travelzoo based on the Q3 2013 results."
1585372,40691,2013-07-30T15:58:31-04:00,,"In this article I would like to talk about a company that has been on my personal watchlist for a few years now. The company, Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO), which some of you may remember from the daily deals bubble, is well off the highs seen around $100 per share in the months leading up to Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) 2011 initial public offering. At the time, anything and everything associated with the daily deals space caught a bid - valuations didn't matter, it was the dotcom bubble all over again.During this time shares of Travelzoo rose drastically from $40 per share to above $100 as the media, analysts and TV personalities, including Jim Cramer, pumped the stock on television. Well the rise was as quick as the fall shares tumbled all the way down into the mid teens as exuberance for the sector quickly turned into fear as a result of increasing competition in the perfectly competitive market. With the low barriers to entry, every technology company with a decent domain name was vying for market share.While these crazy swings may have caused some investors great pain, Travelzoo as a company has been carrying on business as usual, making money for that matter. Shares have risen a whopping 56% this year as investors begin to realize the potential ahead. Today, shares sit at $30 per share, a far cry from $100. However, in this article I would like to make the bullish case for Travelzoo within the competitive online travel market. I would like to review the company's recent performance, financial situation and growth potential in the years ahead.Recent PerformanceEarlier this month the company reported strong second quarter earnings. Travelzoo was able to generate revenue of $41.3 million during the quarter, representing 5% year-over-year growth. Earnings per share of $0.34 for the quarter came in above analyst consensus estimates of $0.27 per share. However, EPS was lower than last due to investments in sales force expansion, marketing and the hotel booking platform which we will look at in more depth later on.If you want to break down the results by segment, revenue in North America was $30.2 million representing a year-over-year growth of 5%. In Europe, revenue was $11.1 million, representing year-over-year growth of 4%. Travelzoo generated $7.8 million in overall operating income of which $1.9 million was from Europe and $5.9 million from North America. Additionally, the company was able to add 1.5 million net new subscribers even with lower than anticipated advertising spending.Financial SituationIn the case of Travelzoo there isn't all that much to say concerning the company's financial position. Often with smaller companies, investors need to worry about debt and the company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows in order to mange its debt. However, Travelzoo finished the second quarter with $73.4 million in cash, up from $65 million at the end of the first quarter. The nice increase was driven by operating cash flow of $10 million during the quarter. Moreover, the company has successfully operated without any debt weighing on the balance sheet.Hotel Booking: Problems And TailwindsI would like to reference the above photo which was snipped directly from Travelzoo's website. When I tried to book a stay at Green Valley Ranch Resort in Las Vegas I immediately encountered a major booking problem. To book the $59 per night deal, I needed to use the ""Click Here"" link as seen above in order to connect with the resort's separate website. The user, myself, doesn't have the ability to book the stay directly through Travelzoo, thus creating an additional step for prospective customers. Moreover, if I was using my iPad or other mobile device, I would need to actually call and book the deal over the phone using Travelzoo's offer code ""TravelzooJuly."" Again, adding another big step for customers and barrier for Travelzoo.The company is investing heavily into solving this problem during the third quarter Travelzoo plans to spend $1.2 million, in addition to the $900,000 the company spent last quarter, on revamping the booking process. Once finished, customers will be able to avoid extra steps, increasing the simplicity and capabilities within the website. I would expect higher conversion rates on the back of simplicity alone. After all, aren't consumers booking online to avoid the unnecessary steps of conventional hotel booking?The focus on a online hotel booking infrastructure comes at a good time for the company. Using Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Search Interest tools, we can determine the interest for virtually any keyword over the last decade. While I cannot say for certain today, I believe it would be logical to assume search interest and demand are in high correlation. Let's quickly take a look at the search interest, or demand, for ""hotel booking"" on Google:The above graph uses a scale of 0 to 100, a score of 100 would represent all time high record search interest for a specific keyword. In this case, ""hotel booking"" has never seen greater online interest or demand. During the month of July, a score of 100 was recorded amid a strong multi-year upward trend. Google predicts the interest will peak this month before pulling back and registering yet another all time high in the first half of 2014. As with everything these days, consumers are using the internet more often to replace what used to be a long task. Travelzoo's focus on the hotel booking platform comes at the exact time of all time high demand for online hotel booking. I would expect the company to have finished the upgrades by the predicted new high next year.Mobile GrowthWhen I was looking at Travelzoo earlier this year I was impressed with the fact the company generated 35% of its traffic via its mobile applications. Today, over 40% of the company's traffic lands at its mobile platform.Over the last year and a half the company's mobile application has grown in popularity by 582%. Management was able to predict the shift to mobile, over the last few quarters management has looked to make the current mobile platform easier to use for the increasing number of customers looking to book online.The company's current mobile platform is not suited to accommodate these customers as it lacks the functionality for customers to book directly from the platform. Customers are instead sent directly to the hotel websites, which may or may not offer customers the ability to book from their mobile device. The company described this problem in detail on the conference call:Time after time again, management has made the case it is missing out on a huge chunk of potential revenues as a result of the inefficiencies. While the company may not be monetizing the mobile traffic today, there is a solution currently in the works. As I mentioned above, a great deal of cash has been sunk on developing a mobile hotel booking platform. The platform will allow users to quickly and easily book hotel nights within Travelzoo's mobile application, while making it easy for hotels to actively update rates. The new platform will allow hotels to quickly upload last minute deals. Who knows, maybe the new platform will take advantage of smartphone push notifications. While we cannot say for sure today, I would assume by simplifying the process for mobile customers, conversion rates will rise, thus helping revenues and lowering additional customer acquisition expenses.Social GrowthThe advent of social media has fueled Travelzoo's popularity on mobile devices. Over the last year the company has drastically stepped up its mobile presence through a mobile application, Facebook site and Twitter accounts.The rise in Facebook popularity, 465%, will hopefully create a chain reaction for the company in terms of subscriber growth from this channel. As all Facebook users are aware, when one of your friends ""likes"" something, it shows up on your news feed effectively creating free marketing for the ""liked,"" or Travelzoo in this case.As of today, the company has 336,869 followers on twitter @Travelzoo. Over the last year and a half this number has grown 69%, impressive to say the least. While the growth isn't in proportion to the growth within Facebook, every subscriber counts as the number of subscribers has remained the key driver to revenue growth. At the end of the second quarter the company had 23 million subscribers. However, with the help of social media the company thinks it can realistically gain another 12 million. Using conservative per subscriber revenue of $7, $245 million in revenues would be generated, a 62% increase from the revenue reported last year. If you decide to use current per subscriber revenues of $7.40, the company would be generating $259 million in revenues.Pushing vs. PullingFor the life of the company, Travelzoo has generated revenues by pushing deals on its subscribers through spammy emails. Not a bad strategy, it is making good money. But to take the next step the company is looking to start pulling customers. By this I mean consumers will be going to Travelzoo by themselves to find deals without a push. During the last quarter 21% of local revenues were pulled, significant as pulling saves the company advertising dollars and creates repeat customers, helping customer acquisition costs.CompetitionAs I've mentioned previously within this article, Travelzoo operates in a very competitive industry. Just Google ""hotel booking"" and you will come across a variety of names including Kayak, Booking.com, Orbitz (NYSE:OWW), Expedia (EXPE) and Travelzoo all promising deep discounts on your favorite destinations. Through Travelzoo's website consumers can even search through the competition to book their reservations. Late last week competitor Expedia, owner of Hotels.com, reported a dismal quarter in which revenues and earnings came in lower than anticipated. The poor results were driven in large part to a 33% increase in marketing costs and greater competition within the industry. While the entire travel space may trade lower off these results, investors must realize where one is losing someone else is gaining.The way in which Travelzoo can differentiate itself is through the daily deals style of business it already uses. The majority of the competition already has a direct booking platform nearly identical to the one I believe Travelzoo is creating. However, these websites seem to cater to the traveler who already planned and chosen their travel dates. With Travelzoo's model of selling hotel vouchers, the company is targeting a different consumer - the consumer who may not be planning a trip but all the sudden sees a deal for a trip within a certain period of time and wants to buy it. In the years ahead I would expect to see further consolidation within the industry to keep marketing costs manageable. Similar to the airline industry, most consumers are looking for just the best deal on the market. Increased consolidation would allow the larger firms greater pricing power from the hotels themselves as there are less options available.RisksConclusionI think you can buy Travelzoo here. The company has positioned itself to benefit from a few key tailwinds. Hotel booking, mobility and social marketing will all be the driver of revenues and earnings in the years ahead. While small, $455 million in market cap, the company is generating significant profits, funding the future without debt, and sitting on a nice chunk of cash. I know we as investors are not supposed to buy a company on the hopes of a buyout, but I feel one of the larger players in the space may be interested. Consolidation within this space has been trending as of late.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in TZOO over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1473541,23479,2013-05-31T11:44:46-04:00,,"Quick TakeWith the introduction of the hotel booking option on its websites later this year, Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) will mark a shift from its existing business model. Offering deep discounts to its users, Travelzoo is primarily an Internet media company that provides travel and entertainment companies as well as small businesses, the ability to efficiently reach out to consumers to sell their services and products.Believing that its hotel search offerings was not meeting the needs of users and hotel owners, Travelzoo has been investing to build its own hotel booking platform. The hotel booking platform will enable users to book hotels directly via Travelzoo’s website or through mobile products, allowing suppliers to promote deals in a more flexible manner; e.g. loading a last minute rate for a hotel will become much easier compared to Travelzoo’s current solution.We believe that Travelzoo’s entry in hotel bookings is a good long term strategy as it opens up an additional revenue opportunity for the company. It recently appointed Steven Rubin as its Vice-President to spearhead the initiative. Steven has over 15 years of hotel sales and revenue management experience working with Swissôtel in New York, Kimpton Hotel and Restaurant Group and Commercial Director of YOTEL Limited.In this article we discuss key features of Travelzoo’s upcoming booking platform and how it can accelerate the company’s growth rate in the future.The hotel booking feature is currently being tested on Perfect Escape’s website, which was acquired by Travelzoo last year. Travelzoo earned $400,000 in gross bookings in Europe and North America in Q1 2013. The booking feature will initially be offered on Travelzoo’s websites, but the company intends to roll out the platform across all products by the end of 2013.Segmenting Its Subscriber Base Travelzoo plans to operate its booking platform in a close booking environment by offering the option to a set of VIP subscribers only. The company will invite a select group of travelers who are an affluent demographic and most engaged and interested in travel from its 26 million subscriber base for an exclusive access to the booking platform.Additionally, Travelzoo intends to showcase only select hotels which rank high on its subscriber reviews. The company is undergoing a stringent screening process to arrive at a list of hotels to partner with. The initial group will include 600 hotels, which will extend to 3,000 globally in the medium term (the company has not specified a time period). Travelzoo aims to aggressively ramp up the number of hotels and deals offered in the latter part of 2013.Possible Increase In Gross Bookings And Take RatesTravelzoo’s robust growth in its hotel business so far has been primarily driven by the launch of its Getaway hotel offering. Getaway is a voucher model which is gaining popularity among medium and small size hotels as it provides them with an opportunity to stimulate incremental sales. The Getaways deals usually include a night or two at a hotel or resort within a two-hour drive or short flight from subscribers’ homes and includes a fine dining experience or resort credit, plus other extras. Travelzoo registered 50% growth in its Getaway platform in 2012.With the launch of the booking platform, a user can book a hotel room for any specific date throughout the year. Hotel voucher sales have increased by approximately 48% in the last year, and we believe the introduction of the booking feature can accelerate the growth momentum in the future.Historically, Travelzoo has seen a continuous decline in its take rate, which is the percentage share of deal value earned by the company. In its Q1 2013 earnings call transcript, the company highlighted that it continued to witness declining take rates due to increasing competition in the market. Despite a rapid increase in gross booking on the Getaway platform, the company claims to be earning low take rates from this business.We believe that the hotel booking VIP program could help stabilize the decline in Travelzoo’s average take rate. The company promises to provide its booking platform subscibers with a good travel experience at the best available price. While this might not necessarily mean the cheapest deals, Travelzoo believes its VIP customers will be willing to pay more for a high-end experience.Our price estimate of $23.32 for Travelzo0 is at a discount of over 10% to the current market price.Disclosure: No positions"
1541052,23479,2013-07-09T15:57:52-04:00,,"Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) is a leading global Internet media company that allows travel, entertainment and local businesses to market and sell their services to its vast 26 million users subscriber base. The company has several publications and newsletters across the globe. Travelzoo also operates SuperSearch.com and Fly.com search engines that allow users to find best travel sites and prices on flights. Additionally, the company operates local deals and getaway services that provide its subscribers with high quality deals for restaurants, spas, shows, concerts, etc.Travelzoo’s stock price has increased by more than 30% since the start of the year driven by higher spending by vacation packagers and growth in the getaway hotel deals. Our price estimate of $23.32 for Travelzoo marks our valuation at a discount of about 20% to the current market price as we believe growing competition will put pressure on certain drivers including ad revenue per subscriber, average revenue per deal and searches via Supersearch.In this article, we provide a quick snapshot of how Travelzoo makes money, the important segments that contribute to its business, and the key factors driving its valuation.What Are the Key Markets for Travelzoo? Travelzoo offers its services in North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. The company divested its stake in the Asia-Pacific business in 2009, which is now being operated by Travelzoo (Asia) Ltd. and Travelzoo Japan K.K. under a license agreement with Travelzoo. The company does not have material economic interests or significant ongoing involvement with the Asia-Pacific business. While the company generates over 70% of its revenues from North American operations, the revenue share of Europe is increasing as growth in the North American business is slowing down.Travelzoo derives the majority of its revenue from advertising, primarily listing fees paid by travel, entertainment and local businesses to advertise their offers. The company also earns revenue from merchant agreements with local deals and getaway advertisers. In addition, airlines and travel agencies pay Travelzoo for displaying them in the search results on Fly.com and Supersearch.com. What Are the Important Segments That Contribute to Its Growth?Although, Travelzoo’s revenue has historically seen consistent double-digit growth, its revenue grew by only 2% in 2012 due to a sharp decline in advertising revenue. The company made $151 million in 2012, and earned almost a 20% operating profit margin on the same which is constant across its business segments. With a revenue contribution of 57%, advertising is the company’s primary source of revenue. Local deals are next with 32% revenue contribution, followed by search with 11%.1) Growth in Subscriber Base to Be Limited by a Decline in Ad Revenue Per SubscriberDespite consistent annual declines in advertising revenue per subscriber driven by higher competition, Travelzoo’s revenue from advertising has increased in recent years due to the growth in its subscriber base. However in 2012, its advertising revenue declined by 14%, as 9% growth in its subscriber base was offset by a more than 20% decline in advertising revenue per subscriber.With a large number of publishing forums such as Travelzoo website, Travelzoo Top 20 email newsletter, Newsflash and Travelzoo Network, the company benefits from a broad subscriber base. While the company sells advertising space in both North America and Europe, the latter has greater scope for subscriber growth and ad rate increases as the business in the region is less developed than North America.The IAB Europe’s annual AdEx Benchmark survey shows that the online advertising market in Europe witnessed continued strong growth, with a growth rate of about 15% in 2011 and 12% in 2012. In Europe, Travelzoo operates in France, Germany, Spain, and the U.K, which are among the top 10 online markets in the region by ad spend and together account for over 70% of the total online ad spend. Although Travelzoo’s presence in the most attractive markets in the region positions it well to leverage the online advertising growth in Europe, such prospects for the region will also attract competition and put pressure on advertising rates charged by the company.We forecast single-digit growth in advertising revenue through the review period since an increase in subscriber base is offset by competition fueled annual declines of 3% in advertising revenue per subscriber.2) Long-Term Decline in Revenue From Local DealsThe local deals business for Travelzoo, which was launched in the third quarter of 2010 has been a significant revenue generating opportunity for the firm. The company is differentiating itself from group-buying sites such as Groupon by leveraging its existing relationships with hotels and customer base from publishing forums and by targeting more affluent customers who have an appetite for higher-end deals.It also launched Getaway in 2011, under which promotional deals are offered to consumers based on a voucher selling model. Since Getaway is gaining popularity among medium and small size hotels, the company is taking steps to increase its sales force. Additionally, Travelzoo is in the process of opening up a hotel-booking platform and is working towards providing its users the ability to book hotels directly via its website through mobile products.While we forecast revenue from local deals to increase in the short term, we expect it to decline in the long term as average revenue earned on a deal declines by more than half, owing to an increase in competition from other local deals sellers such as Groupon and LivingSocial.3) SuperSearch to Offset Rise in Searches Via Fly.com Travelzoo’s search division includes revenues from both Fly.com, a travel search engine and Supersearch, a pay-per-click travel search tool. While the company has registered an increase in searches via Fly.com, the number of searches on Supersearch has declined over the years due to increasing competition from other search engines and marketing spend being diverted from Supersearch toward Fly.com.Historically, Fly.com was only an airfare search engine enabling users to find and compare flight options and real-time fares. In November 2011, hotel and car rental search functionalities were integrated into fly.com. Unlike air ticket bookings, hotel reservations require the travelers to conduct extensive search for best fares. Fly.com simplifies a user’s search process by simplifying the comparison of fares available over different online travel agencies.While we forecast Fly.com to register year-over-year growth of over 10% for the rest of our review period driven by growth in hotel searches and positive synergy with the company’s core travel business, we expect a steady decline in searches via Supersearch to limit growth in total number of searches.4) Profit Margin to Remain Range-Bound Owing to CompetitionTo serve its growing subscriber base better, Travelzoo has been investing heavily in advertising campaigns, expanding its sales force and enhancing its product offerings. Travelzoo’s EBITDA margin decreased significantly from 24% in 2010 to 13% in 2011, due to aggressive investment into team expansion and product portfolio enhancement. As the company slowed investments in 2012, EBITDA margin increased to 19%.We expect the investments to start paying off this year leading to EBITDA margin of 25% on a 13% increase in revenue. Thereafter, we forecast it to remain range bound on account of increase in competition and high subscriber acquisition costs.Disclosure: No positions."
1355671,23479,2013-04-19T20:57:46-04:00,,"With a 7% annual growth in its Q1 2013 revenues ($42.2 million), Travelzoo  (NASDAQ:TZOO) continued the growth momentum gained in Q4 2012 as it  witnessed higher spending by vacation packagers and growth in the  Getaway hotel deals, both in North America and Europe. Though the  continued investment in expanding its sales force, increasing subscriber  marketing and development charges for the hotel booking platform led to  a decline in Travelzoo’s current operating income, we believe the above  measures are important to drive its future growth.Travelzoo witnessed only a marginal rise in 2012 revenue  as certain factors - the challenging economic situation, airline  consolidation, lower spending by online booking engines and increasing  operating expenses - dampened its short-term growth. Nevertheless, the  company maintained a strong financial position with positive cash flow,  growing cash and no debt.We believe that a strengthening hotel business, growth in mobile  traffic and social media integration places it in a good position to  leverage future growth in the online travel industry.Introduction Of The Hotel Booking Feature To Drive GrowthBelieving that its hotel search offerings were not meeting the needs of users and hotel owners, Travelzoo has been  investing to build its own hotel booking platform and will launch the  same later this year. The hotel booking platform will enable users  to book hotels directly via Travelzoo’s website or through mobile  products, allowing suppliers to promote deals in a more flexible manner;  e.g. loading a last minute rate for a hotel will become much easier  compared to Travelzoo’s current solution.The hotel booking feature is currently  being tested on Perfect Escape’s website, which was acquired by  Travelzoo last year and earned $400,000 in gross bookings in Q1 2013.  The booking feature will initially be offered on Travelzoo’s websites,  but the company intends to roll out the platform across all products by  the second half of 2013.Additionally, Travelzoo aims to  aggressively ramp up the number of hotels and deals offered in the  latter part of 2013. Hotel voucher sales have increased by approximately  48% in the last year and we believe the introduction of the booking  feature will continue the growth momentum further as well.Local Deals Remain An Attractive Business OpportunityOwing to a declining number of vouchers sold  per deal and lower take rates, Travelzoo’s Local Deals business suffered  in both regions, offsetting growth from other divisions. On a q-o-q  basis, North America and Europe reported 4% and 8% lower revenue from  the Local Deals segment, respectively. Though Travelzoo’s increasing  presence in new markets led to a higher number of published deals, the  positive impact of the same was offset by a decline in average vouchers  sold per deal.With increasing Internet penetration, the  rise of social commerce and the expanding online travel market, the  deals business has immense long-term growth potential. However, while  the advantages of entering this market are apparent, the low entry  barrier pitches Travelzoo against a large number of existing competitors  as well as potential new entrants in the market.Nevertheless, we think Travelzoo’s  entry in the Local Deals space is a good long-term strategy and believe  that the company has the capability to retain its competitiveness in the  deals business. So far, only a small proportion of local businesses  advertise online. BIA/Kelsey, a media advisory firm, estimates that the  local businesses’ online marketing spend will increase to $35 billion by  2014, compared to approximately $20 billion in 2010. [1]An increasing investment in building a  strong sales force and its focus on high quality deals could help drive  future growth in Travelzoo’s Local Deals Business. Additionally, its  existing hotel relationships and growing subscriber base for its other  products, like the Top 20 Newsletter, could give the company an edge  over its competitors.High Operating Expenses To Drive Future GrowthAn expanding sales force, increasing  subscriber base and investment in new product development has negatively  impacted Travelzoo’s bottom line. While this has restricted its short  term growth momentum, we believe the investment can accelerate revenues  in the future by increasing the number of business from which Travelzoo  publishes deals as well as expanding its audience base. In its earnings  call, the company mentioned that the increasing productivity of the  sale personnel hired last year helped it reach a wider audience and  publish more deals which in turn contributed to higher revenues.Rising headcount costs, increased  subscriber marketing, legal and professional fees and development costs  for the hotel booking platform will further increase Travelzoo’s  expenses this quarter. It estimates an investment of $900,000 for the  booking engine alone with no immediate revenue benefits from the  platform.While the increase in investments might be  detrimental for Travelzoo’s short-term growth, we expect it to play a  crucial role to spur the company’s long-term top-line growth. Going  forward, we expect the expenses to reduce, and as Travelzoo plans to  focus on growth and improved productivity, we estimate margins to  stabilize in the long run.Disclosure: No positions."
1175341,23479,2013-02-12T13:43:31-05:00,,"The weak macro conditions and lower revenue from Local Deals and Supersearch led to a slowdown in Travelzoo's  (NASDAQ:TZOO) business in Q3 2012. However, driven by higher revenue  from Local Deals and growing strength in its Getaway platform, the  company saw a 4% sequential and 5% annual increase in its Q4 2012  earnings (see ""Local Deals And Getaway Platform Lift Travelzoo's Earnings, Outlook"").While higher revenue from travel and Local Deals contributed to a  year-over-year growth in both North America and Europe, Travelzoo's search  revenue continued declining in Q4 2012. Besides macro headwinds, reduced  spending by certain online bookings engines, airlines, and vacation  packagers has impacted the number of searches on Travelzoo's websites.  The growth in number of searches slowed down to 2.4% in 2012, as  compared to 11.2% and 8.5% in 2010 and 2011, respectively.While we forecast a continuous decline in searches via Supersearch,  we estimate the searches on Fly.com to register year-over-year growth for the  rest of our review period. We believe that the increasing marketing  spend on Fly.com, the introduction of the hotel bookings platform and  the expanding mobile platform, will help revive growth in travel  searches.Diverting Marketing Spend Away From Supersearch.comTravelzoo's search division includes revenues from both Fly.com, a  travel search engine, and Supersearch, a pay-per-click travel search  tool. While Travelzoo registered an increase in searches via Fly.com in  2012, the number of searches on Supersearch has declined over the years  as it diverts its marketing spend away from Supersearch, and toward  Fly.com.While Travelzoo is looking toward a strategic review of its  Supersearch product to stabilize the decline in the number of searches,  it is also investing heavily in further developing the Fly.com platform. It claims Fly.com is superior in technology compared to  Supersearch.com.Fly.com is Travelzoo's main focus with regard to its search business  and an important part of its growth strategy. The company is taking a  strong interest in the product and incurring heavy marketing spend on  the same. It claims to have incurred relatively higher spending on its  search platform in Q4 2012.Development of Hotel Booking Platform to Fuel SearchesInitially, Fly.com was only an airfare search engine enabling users  to find and compare flight options and real-time fares from hundreds of  airlines and major travel websites. In November 2011, Travelzoo  officially launched a hotel and car rental search functionality on  Fly.com. After entering the search criteria, results can be filtered in  several different ways to best fit travelers' needs, which include  pricing, star-rating, location, amenities, and type of property (resort,  hotel, B&B, or even hostel).However, believing that its hotel search offerings was not meeting  the needs of users and hotel owners, Travelzoo has decided to launch its  own hotel booking platform. It has been incurring  increasing development costs for building its hotel booking  platform. While the increase in investments might hurt  short-term  growth, we expect it to play a crucial role to spur long-term search  growth.The new hotel booking platform will enable users to book hotels  directly via Travelzoo's website or through mobile products. Since hotel  bookings offer higher revenue per traveler compared to airlines, we  think that improvising its hotel offerings should augur well for the  number of searches on Travelzoo's websites.Expanding Mobile User Base to Fuel Fly.com SearchesEnhancing and developing new mobile applications and focusing on  improving conversion rates on its mobile platform are some of the key  strategic areas for Travelzoo. The company intends to transform the  entire product organization to a mobile first organization this year.While Supersearch continues to be very popular with OTAs because it  delivers extremely efficient bookings, the company claims that the  product is relatively time consuming for users compared to newer  comparison models and is not so suitable for mobile. We believe that  Fly.com is better positioned to leverage growth in the mobile user base,  which in turn can lead to higher search queries for Travelzoo.The Travelzoo application has been downloaded by 1.5 million people  so far and mobile traffic accounts for one-third of the total traffic on  Travelzoo’s websites. We expect this proportion to significantly  increase in the future.Our price estimate of $23.01 for Travelzoo is almost in line with the current market price.Disclosure: No positions."
1337831,23479,2013-04-12T12:06:54-04:00,,"Travelzoo  (NASDAQ:TZOO), a leading Internet media company, witnessed only a  marginal rise in 2012 revenue as certain factors -- challenging economic  situation, airline consolidation, lower spending by online booking  engines, and increasing operating expenses -- dampened its short-term  growth. In addition to weak macro conditions, lower revenue from Local  Deals and Supersearch led to a slowdown in its North American and  European business. However, after a flat Q2 2012 and a disappointing Q3,  the 5% annual increase in Travelzoo's Q4 2012 earnings were  a pleasant surprise.Despite the temporary setback, we believe that both Local Deals and  searches (Fly.com) divisions will be important growth drivers for  Travelzoo. The company has a strong financial position with a positive  cash flow, increasing cash and no debt -- all of which support our belief in its  long-term growth potential. Additionally, the growing  strength in its hotel business driven by Getaway hotel offerings, robust  growth in mobile traffic, and social media integration places it in a  good position to leverage future growth in the online travel industry.Travelzoo is slated to release its Q1 2013 results on Monday, April  15. We expect earnings to continue the growth momentum build up in  Q4 2012.Local Deals Business Offers Long-Term Growth OpportunitiesHaving suffered a setback in Q3 2012,  Travelzoo's Local Deals business witnessed steady growth during Q4 2012.  Seasonal factors and continued expansion in its sales force led to a 4% and 20% sequential increase in Local Deals revenue from North America  and Europe, respectively. However, a growing number of published deals  last quarter was offset by a decline in average vouchers sold per deal.With increasing Internet penetration, the  rise of social commerce, and the expanding online travel market the  deals business has immense long-term growth potential.

Travelzoo has been focusing on  extending its reach to additional U.S., Canadian, and European cities  while aiming to increase deal frequency and revenue per market. (see also ""Is Travelzoo's Local Deals Business A Good Opportunity Long Term?"").Increase in Searches Via Fly.comTravelzoo's search division includes revenues from both Fly.com, a  travel search engine, and Supersearch, a pay-per-click travel search  tool. While the company has registered an increase in searches via  Fly.com, the number of searches on Supersearch has declined over the  years, as Travelzoo diverts its marketing spend away from Supersearch  and toward Fly.com.

Additionally, Fly.com is better positioned to leverage  growth in the mobile user base, which in turn can lead to higher search  queries for Travelzoo. Travelzoo receives around 28% of its traffic via  mobile devices and we expect the proportion to increase in the future.While we forecast a continuous decline in searches via Supersearch,  we estimate the searches on Fly.com to register year-over-year growth for the  rest of our review period. We feel that the launch of hotel search will  power search volumes growth, and the positive synergy with its core  travel business will augur well for traffic at Fly.com.Increasing Operating Expenses to Accelerate Growth Travelzoo saw a significant decline in its EBITDA margin in 2011 due  to increasing advertising spend on building brand awareness and higher  general and administrative expenses incurred on account of headcount  growth to scale international expansion. Though the EBITDA margin  increased overall for 2012, Travelzoo's bottom line suffered in Q4 2012  due to increasing investments in headcount and subscriber acquisition as  well as higher marketing expenses.The company anticipated high operating expenses in Q1 2013 as well  due to continued ramp up of headcount, increased marketing, legal and  professional fees, and development costs for building its hotel booking  platform. While the increase in investments might be detrimental for short-term  growth, we expect it to play a crucial role to spur long-term top-line  growth. Going forward, we expect the expenses to reduce and as  Travelzoo plans to focus on growth and improved productivity, we  estimate margins to stabilize in the long run.We will update our price estimate of $23 for Travelzoo after the Q1 2013 earnings release.Disclosure: No positions."
1171861,33311,2013-02-11T11:08:27-05:00,,"I know it's a preposterous idea but I believe Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) could return to old highs of $100+ a share. The company appears to be languishing here in the low $20's/high teens as revenue growth has left the building in a hurry. However, I believe the company is laying the groundwork for significantly higher prices.Since my prior article, ""Is Travelzoo A Buyout Candidate?"" the stock is up about 10% after reporting another quarter of average revenue growth, yet solid cash flow generation. In the report and the conference call, the company talked at length about some areas that really get me excited about the company.In my prior article I stated that one issue I had with their website that I saw right off the bat was if I'm there and let's say I'm looking for a good deal on a hotel in a city and I find a place I'd like to book with but the hotel doesn't offer a deal for the date I want to travel, I have no way of booking with that hotel. That's a major problem. Through Travelzoo, I can do a search and see rates from HotelPlanner.com, Orbitz (NYSE:OWW), Booking.com, Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), etc; however, I still don't have an easy way of booking a room with that hotel for the dates I need. Not only does this increase the likelihood of a user leaving the site but it also reduces the potential commissions and future revenues TZOO can generate from users. This latest quarterly report addressed this issue at length.The CEO acknowledged that a major weakness with their current mobile platform is that with mobile they can't pass on a discount code in a URL on to another site. This means that if someone wanted to book a deal right now with a hotel and there is a coupon code attached to the deal, the only way someone could take advantage of the coupon code is by calling the number listed on the deal and booking it over the phone. This is a major problem and is causing significant ""leakage"" (i.e., users leaving the site/app out of frustration and going to a competitors site).Additionally, some hotel deals link directly to hotel websites that might not be optimized for smartphones and therefore rendering the mobile user out of luck when trying to book a deal.TZOO recognizes the significance of this issue and has begun developing a hotel booking platform that will allow customers to book on mobile apps and, most importantly, allows hotels to update offers electronically by logging into the platform, as opposed to the current method of having to manually update offers by phone with TZOO. This is a major advancement that the market, in my opinion, hasn't really caught on to. This platform is expected to be operational by Q3 2013 and I believe it will be a significant growth driver.As I mentioned in my prior article, TZOO is currently doing a very poor job monetizing the traffic they are getting. Between not having a hotel booking platform and only allowing customers to do business with vendors on days when their local deals or offers are allowed, they are losing a good deal of business. This was the reason why I considered TZOO to be a buyout candidate. They are generating more than half the traffic of Kayak (NASDAQ:KYAK) yet they are trading for 1/5 the price.In terms of valuation, the company trades at a huge discount to their peers: a P/E of 15 vs an industry wide average of 25; a price to free cash flow of 12 vs an industry wide average of 22; and a price to sales average of 2 vs an industry wide average of 4. Included in their industry are KYAK, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), Priceline (PCLN), OWW, and EXPE.The company in its most recent quarter reported some very impressive growth figures in mobile: 1/3 of all traffic now comes from mobile, mobile app downloads increased 427% year on year and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) fans increased 274%. The company began adding additional photos to top 20 deals and added Facebook feedback on each deal that increases the stickiness of deals and sell through rates on vouchers. Sell through rates increased 12% and click through rates increased 14% as a result of these changes.What is also impressive is that they were able to grow revenues in Europe 10% in a period of significant weakness in Europe and they grew their revenues on hotel getaway deals by 50%, resulting in $1.3 million sequential growth in their ""travel"" segment. This is at a time when there was no hotel booking platform in place.By the end of the year the hotel getaways deals numbers could be pretty staggering as the hotel-booking platform is rolled out. The company is still a top 10 travel website in the US and has a pristine balance sheet: $61.2 million in cash and no debt. Should the hotel booking platform be a success in monetizing the traffic that leaks from there site, I believe investors will scramble to get back into TZOO and I think there is an outside chance the stock could rally back to old highs within the next year. The company has been buying back stock rapidly - they repurchased $7.9 million in Q4 alone and shares have shrunk about 10% over the past year. With the new hotel booking platform I believe the company can begin to show meaningful revenue growth and EPS growth of at least 20% and could do a $2 EPS run rate or more by Q3 or Q4 2013. If that should happen then I believe investors could pay 40 to 50 times earnings as they see tangible signs of traffic monetization.Additionally, I think Yahoo (YHOO) or another online travel agent would be smart to buy the company as it currently trades at roughly half the industry average on several different valuation metrics.Disclosure: I am long TZOO. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Additional disclosure: After reading the earnings report and listening to the most recently conference call and knowing the story very well, I have decided to take a position after the earnings call at around $21.  I may add more shares on weakness."

While its search revenue continued declining in Q4 2012, higher revenue from travel and Local Deals contributed to an y-o-y growth in both North America and Europe.Though there are certain factors such as the challenging economic situation, airline consolidation, lower spending by online booking engines, increasing operating expenses etc., which could dampen Travelzoo’s short term growth, we maintain a positive outlook for its long-term growth prospects.With growing strength in its hotel business driven by Getaway hotel offering, robust growth in mobile traffic and social media integration as well as potential growth in its Local Deals business, we believe that Travelzoo is in a good position to leverage future growth in the online travel industry. Additionally, the company has a strong financial position with a positive cash flow, increasing cash and no debt.Travelzoo’s stock price jumped by more than 20% after its earnings release and its current market price is almost in line with our price estimate of near $24 for the company.See our full analysis of TravelzooHigh Quality Deals & Sales Force Ramp-Up To Drive Local Deals BusinessHaving suffered a setback in Q3 2012, Travelzoo’s Local Deals business witnessed steady growth during Q4 2012. Seasonal factors and continued expansion in its sales force led to a 4% and 20% sequential increase in Local Deals revenue from North America and Europe, respectively. However, a growing number of published deals last quarter was offset by a decline in average vouchers sold per deal.Travelzoo has been focusing on extending its reach to additional U.S., Canadian and European cities while aiming to increase deal frequency and revenue per market. Travelzoo’s existing hotel relationships and growing subscriber base for its other products, like the Top 20 Newsletter, could give the company an edge over its competitors. In its Q4 2012 earnings call transcript, Travel mentioned that over a million people have bought Local Deals from them so far.We feel an increasing investment in building a strong sales force and its focus on high quality deals could help drive future growth in Travelzoo’s Local Deals Business. While its strategy to only feature high-quality merchants was one of the contributing factors for lower deals revenue in Q3 2012, Travelzoo believes that quality experience leads to referral behavior that in turn helps its brand thrive over the long-term.Scaling Growth In The Getaway PlatformWhile the lower revenue from airline bookings and packages have slowed growth, the company has seen robust growth in its hotel business primarily driven by Getaway hotel offering. Getaways, which was launched in 2011, is a voucher model which is gaining popularity among medium and small size hotels as it provides them with an opportunity to stimulate incremental sales. Travelzoo registered 50% growth in business from the Getaway platform and we expect the revenues to continue growing in the future as well.Currently, Travelzoo does not offer direct online bookings for a specific date. However, it aims to roll-out its new hotel booking platform that will enable its users to book hotels directly via its website or through mobile products. Additionally, with rampant increase in its sales force, the company intends to ramp up the number of hotels and deals in its portfolio in the future.We feel that the above developments will further accelerate demand for hotel bookings, which will continue to significantly contribute to Travelzoo’s revenue growth.Rising Operating Expenses Will Fuel Future GrowthTravelzoo saw a significant decline in its EBITDA margin in 2011 due to increasing advertising spend on building brand awareness and higher general and administrative expenses incurred on account of headcount growth to scale international expansion. Even in Q4 2012, the company’s bottom-line suffered due to increasing investments in headcount and subscriber acquisition as well as higher marketing expenses. The company anticipates high operating expenses this quarter as well due to continued ramp up of headcount, increased marketing, legal and professional fees and development costs for building its hotel booking platform.While the increase in investments might be detrimental for short-term growth, we expect it to play a crucial role to spur long-term top-line growth.

1038701,23479,2012-11-30T15:36:32-05:00,,"A challenging macro environment, increasing airline consolidation, and  mounting expenses are some of the factors that are restricting Travelzoo's  (NASDAQ:TZOO) growth rate. While the company managed to post a small  sequential gain in revenue in Q2 2012, its Q3 results were disappointing  with an 8% decline in revenue and 42% year-over-year  decline in net income.  (Read our earnings article: ""Travelzoo's Earnings Fall On Macro Headwinds And Big Investments."")The expanded product offerings with the addition of Local Deals and  Getaway has contributed to Travelzoo's growth in the last few years.  However, the growth rate has slowed down recently. While Local Deals  revenue registered significant year-over-year growth both in North America (15%)  and Europe (28%) in Q2 2012, the segment posted a significant decline in  Q3 2012, which was one of the primary reasons for the sharp decline in Travelzoo's revenue.However, we continue to believe that Local Deals and Getaway, along  with increased investment in product  innovations, will be important  drivers for Travelzoo's future growth. Here we discuss certain factors  that contribute to our belief that Local Deals could be an important  revenue driver in the coming years.Travelzoo is primarily a global Internet media company, which provides  travel and entertainment companies the ability to effectively reach out  to potential customers to sell their services and products. The company  ventured into the social commerce space with the launch of Local Deals  in August 2010 that allows subscribers to purchase vouchers for deals  from local businesses such as spas, hotels, and restaurants at attractive  prices.We estimate the Local Deals business to contribute around 15% to  Travelzoo's stock price. While advertising accounts for the majority  (68%) of Travelzoo's revenue, we feel the extension of Local Deals in  additional markets can expand the company's user base which could  translate into higher advertising revenues in the future.Revenue Synergies With Other Businesses Could Drive Volume for Local DealsTravelzoo attributes the lower voucher sales per deal to the highly  competitive environment, seasonal factors, and known challenges with its  own conversion process. However, we feel that by leveraging its existing  portfolio of diverse products, the company can get an edge over rising  competition in the social commerce space.Travelzoo can package Local Deals with placements in the Travelzoo  Top  20 newsletter, the company's core product.  This would help  Travelzoo expand its reach, thereby driving higher deal volumes.Additionally, Travelzoo can leverage the expansion of its search  business, Supersearch and Fly.com to generate more traffic for its Local  Deals business. While making travel bookings customers also search for  things to do upon arrival. Local Deals can play an important role here  by provide interesting entertainment  and dining options in different  travel destinations.Increasing Productivity of Sales ForceHigh investment in increasing headcount is one of the main reasons for the sharp increase in Travelzoo's operating expenses. The  company kept a target to hire 50 additional sales staff this year and  intends to further increase its sales force this quarter to meet the  target. Travelzoo believes that the expansion in its sales force can be  an important driver to fuel growth in deals.However, Travelzoo claims that the  productivity of new sales staff typically comes after a few quarters. As  its new sales staff near their peak productivity over the course of the  next year, it will lead to additional sales revenue for Travelzoo.  Also, with an increase in global sales force it aims to increase its  market coverage in the future. Travelzoo has been focusing on extending  its reach to additional U.S.,   Canadian,   and European  cities while  aiming to  increase deal frequency  and   revenue per market.Deal Quality to Drive Future Growth Travelzoo claims that its strategy to only feature high-quality  merchants and not to expand into categories too far from its core were  contributing factors for the decline in its deals revenue in Q3 2012.  (Europe and North America declined by 10% and 13%, respectively.) However, the company believes that in the long run, its strong focus on  quality leadership will drive increasing loyalty toward its brand and  position it well in the market. Travelzoo intends to continue building  on its high quality deals portfolio across local, entertainment, and  travel categories.Rapid Growth in the Getaway PlatformWhile travel revenue declined due to lower advertising spend by some   online booking engines (airlines and vacation packagers) the same was   offset by continued growth in Getaway hotels offering in Q3 2012.  Travelzoo  registered a significant increase in hotel revenue with 45%  year-over-year growth  in the Getaway format.Getaways, which was launched in 2011, is a voucher model which is   gaining popularity among medium and small size hotels as it provides   them with the opportunity to stimulate incremental sales. The   Getaways  deals usually include a night or two at a relatively  high-end   hotel  or resort within a two-hour drive or short flight from    subscribers'  homes and include a fine-dining experience or resort    credit plus  other extras.Currently, Travelzoo does not offer direct online bookings for a   specific date. However, it is in the process of opening up a hotel   booking platform and is working toward providing its users the ability   to book hotels directly.  Additionally, the company intends to ramp up  its hotel sales force to  capture the growing demand for Getaways.We feel that the above developments will further accelerate demand   for hotel bookings, which will continue to significantly contribute to   Travelzoo's revenue growth. Our price estimate for Travelzoo of $23.80 is at a premium of over 30% to the current market price.Disclosure: No positions."
1749282,23479,2013-10-16T16:09:03-04:00,,"Leading Internet travel media company, Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) is set to release its Q3 2013 results on Thursday, October 17. The company posted 5% annual growth in its Q2 2013 revenues ($41.3 million), on the back of higher spending by vacation packagers and cruisers, and continued growth in Getaway voucher sales for hotels, both in North America and Europe. On the other hand, EBITDA margins were negatively impacted due to investments on subscriber marketing, sales force expansion and new product development.Travelzoo expects to register sequentially slower growth in Q3 2013 revenues due to seasonality. Although the company intended to continue its investments in Q3 2013 that would impact EBITDA margins, we believe that such investments are important to drive future growth in its business. With focus on strengthening the hotel business, and mobile and social integration, Travelzoo is in a good position to leverage future growth in the online travel industry. The company has a strong financial position with a positive cash flow, increasing cash and no debt, which reiterates our belief in its long term growth potential.Our price estimate of $24 for Travelzoo marks our valuation at a discount of about 10% to the current market price.Focus on Audience Engagement Strategies To Enhance Subscriber BaseTravelzoo has seen an increase in the audience accessing its services through mobile devices. The company registered a significant increase in mobile traffic, which grew to 40% (of the total traffic) in Q2 2013, from 25% in the same quarter last year; downloads for its iPhone and Android apps experienced about 100% y-o-y growth, reaching 2 million. Travelzoo also saw a record number of visits on social media with approximately 1.5 million combined Facebook fans and Twitter followers at the end of the quarter.Seeing the current trends in the mobile and social media sphere, Travelzoo has decided to shift its mode of communication with subscribers from e-mail only to a balanced approach across mobile, social media and e-mail, in order to lift consumer engagement levels. It plans to achieve this by focusing on product development that will simplify ease of use and create better visual presentations. This was the primary motive behind the decision to launch its new hotel booking platform, as it will allow users to quickly and easily book hotels within Travelzoo's websites and mobile products. The company also remains committed to driving audience growth and engagement across the social platform to build its global brand. We feel this will help increase the subscriber base as users get to access Travelzoo's products via different channels.High Industry Competition To Impact Local Deals BusinessTravelzoo estimates sequentially lower local deals revenue in Q3 2013 due to seasonality issues. The company has been experiencing a declining trend in average vouchers sold per deal. The take rate for the company's deals also decreased in Q2 2013, due to its approach of extending deal periods and selective lowering of high quality deals to differentiate itself from competitors.With increasing Internet penetration, the rise of social commerce and the expanding online travel market, the deals business holds long term growth potential. However, the low entry barriers in the industry pitch Travelzoo against a large number of existing competitors as well as potential new entrants in the market. Owing to further increase in competition, we expect the company's average vouchers sold per deal and take rate to decline in the future.Short-Term EBITDA Margin Headwinds To Provide Benefits In The Long RunRising competition has compelled Travelzoo to increase its investments on subscriber marketing, sales force expansion, new product development, social media and mobile integration, in order to retain and add new subscribers. These investments have impacted the company's EBITDA margins in the recent quarters. At just about 19% for the first half of the year, its EBITDA margin was significantly low.Travelzoo expects to incur $1.2 million in Q3 2013, on the development of its new hotel booking platform that it intends to launch later this year. The company estimates sales and marketing costs to increase by $500,000 compared to Q2 2013 due to investments in audience. It also estimates higher operating expenses due to continued ramp-up of headcount, and legal and professional fees that were not incurred as anticipated in Q2 2013.Although such investments restrict growth in the short term, we believe these will drive long term growth for Travelzoo, by expanding subscriber base and attracting a greater number of publishers to its website. Going forward, we expect lower expenses, and as Travelzoo plans to focus on growth and improved productivity, we estimate margins to stabilize in the long run.We will update our price estimate of $24 for Travelzo after the Q3 2013 earnings release."

The company informs its millions of subscribers around the globe on travel and entertainment deals, in addition to offers from local businesses. Travelzoo's primary method of revenue generation is through advertising fees. The company trades on the NASDAQ with a market capitalization of $362.62M and currently has about 15.8M shares outstanding.On January 24 the company reported its full year and 2012 fourth quarter results, which were followed by an enthusiastic reaction in the company's share price. Closing at $19.21 a share the day before earnings were released, the company's shares propelled on the 24th to close the day at $23.88, a 24.3 percent increase over the prior closing price. This reaction in perplexing as this investor can find nothing in the company's earnings to justify the excessive appreciation in the company's shares.Where did investors find the extremely good news? Was it in the company's revenues?Fourth quarter revenues came in at $37.028M, a 5.3 percent increase of the same period last year. Similarly, 2012 revenues amounted to $151.168M, a 1.9 percent increase over revenues generated in 2011. Which is it that justified a 24 percent increase in the company's shares, the modest 5 percent fourth quarter revenue growth, or the meager 1.9 percent annual revenue growth? Truth is none justifies the reaction and the lofty valuation the company's shares currently trade for.Was the reaction justified by the company's earnings perhaps?Earnings per share in the fourth quarter dropped a whopping 40 percent to $0.24 a share from the same period last year. This was due primarily to higher sales and marketing expenses, which increased 32.8 percent in the quarter. More importantly, full year earnings came in at $1.15 per share, an impressive increase over last year's earnings of $0.20 a share. However, how can it be that the company managed to earn so much, when its top line growth over 2011 was a meager 1.9 percent?Digging deeper, one will immediately notice a gigantic $20M expense classified as ""un-exchanged promotional merger shares"" expensed by the company in 2011. This expense skews 2011 and 2012 earnings dramatically, making 2012 earnings per share growth seem sensational. However, when one adjusts net income to this particular expense, keeping income tax constant for simplicity, one will notice that net income actually declined in 2012 from 2011. As the table below illustrates, adjusting net income by this abnormal expense in both 2011 and 2012, respectively; one arrives at a net income of $21.198M for 2012, less than the $23.319M net income of 2011.To conclude, Travelzoo's January 24th earnings report does not justify the 24 percent share price appreciation that followed. Prudent investors that dig deeper into the numbers and ignore the simple and easy to use headline number will understand that the market overreacted to results that are tolerable at best and disappointing when considering the rich multiple the company is trading at. Indeed, the twenty plus price-to-earnings multiple is simply too excessive for a company whose revenues grew a meager 1.9 percent in the past year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

With over 24  million subscribers, it provides travel and entertainment companies, as  well as small businesses the ability to efficiently reach out to  consumers to sell their services and products. Apart from the Travelzoo  websites, the company has several publications and newsletters across  the globe. In addition, Travelzoo operates Fly.com, a travel search  engine and a social commerce business (Local Deals), which provides its  subscribers with high quality deals for restaurants, spas, shows,  concert events. etc.Touching a high of $31 at the start of the year, Travelzoo has been  treading a downward path since then. Apart from the adverse macro  conditions, we believe that certain intrinsic factors which have slowed  down Travelzoo’s growth this year, are also responsible for the negative  sentiment among investors.Here we provide a quick snapshot of how Travelzoo makes money, the  important segments that contribute to its business and the key factors  driving its valuation.What Are the Key Markets for Travelzoo? How Does the Company Make Money?Travelzoo’s services are available in North America, Europe and Asia  Pacific. In Asia Pacific, its business is operated by Travelzoo (Asia)  Ltd. and Travelzoo Japan K.K., under a license agreement with Travelzoo  Inc. Travelzoo does not have any significant ongoing involvement with  the operations of the Asia Pacific segment since its sale to Azzurro  Capital Inc. in 2009. Thus, Travelzoo now has only two operating  segments -- North America & Europe. More than 75% of its business is  concentrated in North America and the remaining in Europe. The company  is witnessing a higher growth rate in Europe as the North America  business nears saturation.  Travelzoo earns majority of its revenue from advertising,  primarily listing fees paid by travel companies, entertainment companies  and local businesses to advertise their offers. The company also earns  revenue from merchant agreements for Local Deals and Getaway  advertisers.  In addition, airlines and travel agencies pay Travelzoo  for showing them in the search results on Fly.com and Supersearch.com.What Are the Important Segments That Contribute to its Growth?Historically, Travelzoo’s revenue has increased at a rapid pace. The  company made close to $150 million in 2011 and earned 16% operating  profits on the same, which is constant across its business segments.  Advertising accounts for 68% of Travelzoo’s revenues whereas the local  deals and search business segments contribute around 22% and 10%  respectively.Last quarter, a decrease in Travelzoo’s search and Local Deals  business led to a significant decline in its revenues, and  the aggressive investment into team expansion and product portfolio  enhancement, put a downward pressure on its operating margins. However,  we believe that with growing strength in its hotel business, driven by  Getaway hotel offering, a robust increase in mobile traffic and social  media integration, Travelzoo is in a good position to leverage future  growth in the online travel industry.Growing strength in the hotel businessWhile the reduced revenue from airline bookings and packages have  slowed down growth, the company has witnessed robust growth in its hotel  business, primarily driven by Getaway hotel offering. Getaways, which  was launched in 2011, is a voucher model which is gaining popularity  among medium and small size hotels as it provides then with an  opportunity to stimulate incremental sales.Currently, Travelzoo does not offer direct online bookings for a  specific date. However, it is in the process of opening up a hotel  booking platform and is working towards providing its users the ability  to book hotels directly via its website through mobile products.  Additionally, the company intends to ramp up its hotel sales force to  capture the growing demand for Getaways.We feel that the above developments will further accelerate demand  for hotel bookings, which will continue to significantly contribute to  Travelzoo’s revenue growth.Increase in searches via fly.comTravelzoo’s search division includes revenues from both Fly.com, a  travel search engine, and Supersearch, a pay-per-click travel search  tool. While the company has registered an increase in searches via  Fly.com, the number of searches on Supersearch has declined over the  years, as Travelzoo diverts its marketing spend away from Supersearch  and towards Fly.com.Google’s integration of hotel search products on to their main search  results page this year and Travelzoo’s focus to bring Supersearch  Europe to profitability, led to a decline in traffic driven to Fly.com.  The company claims that it needs a strategic review of its Supersearch  product to stabilize the decline in number of searches.While we forecast a continuous decline in searches via Supersearch,  we estimate the searches on Fly.com to register y-o-y growth for the  rest of our review period. We feel that the launch of hotel search will  power search volumes growth, and the positive synergy with its core  travel business will augur well for traffic at Fly.com.Current investments to drive future growthAiming to accelerate its audience growth, Travelzoo has been  aggressively investing in expanding its sales force, enhancing its  product offerings and improvising the content and deals offered on its  websites and newsletters. The company saw a significant decline in  EBITDA margin in 2011 due to increasing advertising spend on building  brand awareness, and higher expenses incurred on account of headcount  growth to scale international expansion. While the high expense base combined with lower top line growth could  slow down Travelzoo’s growth this year, we believe that the same would  accelerate growth once the investments start paying off. The company  intends to pull back certain expenses in line with any potential decline  in revenues in the coming quarters, but remains determined to continue  innovating to stay ahead of competitors.We forecast the EBITDA margins to reach close to the historical level by the end of our forecast period.Our price estimate for Travelzoo at $23.80 is at a premium of over 30% to the current market price.Disclosure: No positions."

While adverse macro conditions contribute to much of this decline, we believe that certain intrinsic factors, which have slowed down Travelzoo’s growth this year, are also responsible for the negative sentiment among investors.Travelzoo reported its Q3 2012 earnings recently and the disappointing results led to a further decline in its stock price. Significant decrease in revenue from Travelzoo’s search and local deals business led to an 8% year-over-year decline in overall revenue and the aggressive investment into team expansion and product portfolio enhancement put a downward pressure on Travelzoo’s operating margins.While there are certain factors such as the challenging economic scenario, airline consolidation, increasing expenses etc., which could dampen Travelzoo’s short-term growth, we maintain a positive outlook for its long-term growth prospects. With growing strength in its hotel business driven by Getaway hotel offering, a robust increase in mobile traffic and social media integration, we believe that Travelzoo is in a good position to leverage future growth in the online travel industry.Our price estimate of $23.80 for Travelzoo is at a premium of over 30% to the current market price. Here, we briefly discuss key factors that reiterate our belief in the same.Current Investments To Drive Future Growth Aiming to accelerate its audience growth, Travelzoo has been aggressively investing in expanding its sales force, enhancing its product offerings and improvising the content and deals offered on its websites and newsletters. The company saw a significant decline in EBITDA margin in 2011 due to increasing  advertising spend on building brand awareness and higher expenses incurred on  account of headcount growth to  scale international expansion.In Q3 2012, Travelzoo increased spending on subscriber marketing by $1.2 million in Q3 2012 compared with the previous quarter. Investments in headcount and subscriber marketing remain key focus areas for Travelzoo and the company expects to see a further increase in its operating expenses this quarter as a result of an increase in headcount, higher legal and professional fees and increasing costs for development of the hotels business.While the high expense base combined with lower topline growth could slow down Travelzoo’s growth this year, we believe that the same would accelerate growth once the investments start paying off. The company intends to pull back certain expenses in line with any potential decline in revenue in the coming quarters, but remains determined to continue innovating to stay ahead of competitors.Growing Strength In The Hotel BusinessWhile the reduced revenue from airline bookings and packages have slowed down growth, the company has witnessed robust growth in its hotel business, primarily driven by Getaway   hotel  offering.

The company claims that it needs a strategic review of its Supersearch product to stabilize the decline in number of searches.“While Supersearch continues to be very popular with OTAs because it  delivers extremely efficient bookings, the product  is relatively time consuming for users compared to newer comparison  models and is not so well suited for mobile.”While we forecast a continuous decline in searches via Supersearch, we estimate the searches on Fly.com to register y-o-y growth for the rest of our  review period. We feel that the launch of hotel search will power search  volumes growth and the positive synergy with its core travel business  will augur well for traffic at Fly.com.Increase In Average Deals Per MarketArmed with strong management and a stable sales force division,   Travelzoo deals reached 125 markets, with an approximate average deal   size of 25,000 in the second quarter. In addition, the company saw  greater success in distributing Local deals  on other  websites such as The Los Angeles Times, Lonely  Planet and The New York  Times via the Travelzoo network.However, the deal revenue in Q3 2012 declined significantly on account of lower average number of vouchers sold per deal. The company feels that a highly competitive environment and its focus  to only feature high-quality merchants and not to expand into categories  too far from its core were the contributing factors for the decline.Local Deals, launched in 2010, provides subscribers with high-quality   deals for restaurant, spa, activity, show or concert events. While we agree that with increasing competition in the deals space, the  average revenue per deal is treading lower, we believe the  partnership with Sysco iCare, the success of Getaways and revenue  synergies with other Travelzoo businesses will help drive volumes in  this segment.Travelzoo intends to publish more deals in existing markets and target new markets to steer demand. Additionally, Travelzoo’s existing hotel relationships  and growing subscriber base   for its other products, like the Top 20  Newsletter, could give the   company an edge over its competitors.We have updated our price estimate for Travelzo0 to $23.81 post the Q3 2012 earnings release."
1102451,33311,2013-01-09T09:42:12-05:00,,"On Nov. 8, 2012, Priceline (PCLN) purchased Kayak Software (NASDAQ:KYAK), a travel metasearch company, for $1.8 billion or $40 per share. While one Kayak investor is seeking to halt the purchase on the grounds that the deal shortchanges investors, it's easy to see from the chart below that the purchase price is significantly higher than the valuation of competitors in the travel space.On Dec. 12, 2012, Liberty Interactive Corp. (LINTA) (NASDAQ:LINTB) bought control of TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) for about $300 million, snapping up a majority of chairman Barry Diller's stake in the travel information website. While Diller only owned about 3% of the equity of the company, he held a proxy that allowed him to control the majority of the voting rights in TRIP owned by Liberty in an arrangement dating from 1995 with IAC/InterActiveCorp (IACI). This deal was included in the spinout from IACI of Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), TRIP's former parent company that spun out TRIP in 2011. Confusing, huh?On Dec. 21, 2012, Expedia made a surprise move and agreed to buy a majority stake in Europe-focused travel metasearch engine Trivago (privately held) just a year after spinning out another ad-based business, TRIP. This came only two months after EXPE management stated that they weren't interested in the metasearch space.So why all of the consolidation? I think the main catalyst for this consolidation has to do with Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) push in the travel space. Over the past 18 months, Google launched Hotel finder and Flight Search, bought Zagat's and integrated their reviews into local business/restaurant search, bought Frommer's and is integrating this into their search services, and they launched Street View for inside hotels. The major players in online travel and hotel booking are clearly consolidating to help counter these efforts from Google.After these recent transactions and consolidation in the travel industry, I thought it would be good to check up on the valuation of major players in the travel space that are publicly traded to see if there are any anomalies that might present investment opportunities.Ultimately, each company in the travel space varies greatly in terms of offerings and specialties. While they all operate in travel offerings, some of them specialize in local deals or in metasearch or in hotels. So it's easy to see that they shouldn't all be painted with the same brush. However, ultimately, the space is very competitive yet very profitable.Barriers to EntryThe argument against players in any internet industry has always been that barriers to entry are low. Any person can set up a website and run it with low overhead. While barriers to entry appear to be small, the reality is that it is very expensive to acquire traffic, and the number of subscribers each company has is a key metric to consider in terms of barriers to entry. For example, the entry by players like Yelp and Google over the past several years should have put a dent into TRIP's business; however, TRIP has well over 50 million loyal users of its website and as you can see from the chart below, TRIP's revenues and net income have approximately doubled in the past three years.TRIP has evolved from a site focused on providing user reviews to one that offers booking services and local deals to its huge user base. It has tapped into the value of its users tremendously by offering aggregated search results from Expedia, Travelocity, Orbitz (NYSE:OWW), Priceline and several other search engines. Its offering now allows people to read reviews, see what your friends think about certain places, and also book travel or hotels. TRIP has been able to increasingly monetize its large user base and has made its website increasingly sticky by integrating reviews, deals, and booking services.Below is a chart of 6 players in the online U.S. travel industry and their key valuation metrics, including price & market cap as of 1/8/13, estimated 2012 revenues and EPS, trailing twelve months (TTM) free cash flow, and net cash as of 9/30/12.Also below is a list of the top 10 travel sites in the U.S. for December 2012 as well as a chart of the Alexa.com rankings for each site. I included in this a rough calculation of the percentage of total U.S. visits and Alexa.com rankings relative to the market caps of each company to get a sense of relative valuation.As you can see from this chart above, valuation varies tremendously. Based on all of the above metrics, it appears that Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) is by far the most undervalued and well-capitalized company in this space (note that while OWW has a cheap valuation in terms of price-to-sales and free cash flow, it has a terrible balance sheet with over $500 million in short-term and long-term debt and for that reason I believe it is wise to avoid it). So why the undervaluation? Below I'll cover the company, the issues it has, and the opportunities for growth.About TravelzooFrom its website:Travelzoo differentiates itself in that it focuses primarily on deals, whether it is travel, entertainment, or local deals. Customers come to their site with the intention of finding good deals.The IssuesFirst, I wanted to spend some time on Travelzoo.com to get a sense for what the user experiences when visiting the site.One issue with their website that I see right off the bat is if I'm there and let's say I'm looking for a good deal on a hotel in San Diego and I find a place I'd like to book with but the hotel doesn't offer a deal for the date I want to travel, I have no way of booking with that hotel. That's a problem. I can do a search and see rates from HotelPlanner.com, Orbitz, Booking.com, Expedia, etc; however, I still don't have an easy way of booking a room with that hotel for the dates I need. Not only does this increase the likelihood of a user leaving the site but it also reduces the potential commissions and future revenues they can generate from users.Another issue I found with the website is that it is too focused on providing deals to its users handpicked from its own staff instead of integrating feedback from its own subscriber base on deals or feedback generated by Yelp reviewers or other review generation sites like TRIP. For example, below is a local deal for a Luxe Texas Hill Country Resort with an additional $50 to spend:The deal provides all of the details you would need before deciding to book and integrates comments from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) users; however, it doesn't integrate actual reviews from people that have visited it before from YELP or TRIP. I know the rationale for this might be that it doesn't want to send its users to a competitor like TRIP; the fact that it directs people to search through competing sites like OWW or EXPE as mentioned above negates this argument. YELP and TRIP are established brands that people recognize and that add credibility to the local deals they're publishing. There is a way to tap into those review sites while still keeping their visitor at their site.Additionally, I found a similar issue as with the San Antonio local deal as I did with the San Diego hotel search: the company is losing out on potential monetization of its deal by not allowing people to book with that establishment directly from their site if the deal is not available on the day the visitor wants to travel. While you are able to contact the establishment directly online or over the phone, TZOO is losing out on an opportunity to gain a loyal customer and generate additional revenues.The other issue I see from a fundamental standpoint is revenues have dropped recently. In Q3, they experienced an 8% drop in revenues as compared to the prior year driven by a $1.9 million drop in search revenues, the majority of which came from a decline in North American hotel search revenues, presumably caused by Google's integration of its hotel search services. Assuming by majority they say it is roughly $1.5 million, this ultimately shouldn't have a huge impact on the company since it still only makes up about 4% of total revenues.The company stated that the 2nd largest factor contributing to the sales decline was that local revenue declined by $1.2 million. This was a result of a competitive deals market as well as an internal decision to keep the quantity of deals low so that its visitors wouldn't be bombarded with low-quality deals.Opportunities for GrowthI do like that TZOO is directing its traffic on the ""Today's Best Fares"" section to its directly-owned website, www.fly.com. However, there is no reason why it can't direct all of its traffic directly to Fly.com since Fly.com is merely an aggregator of results from sites like Orbitz, Expedia, Hotwire, etc. Again, this is an area of potential lost revenues as it is directing a significant portion of its traffic off to those other sites. Since metasearch has been a big area of focus for Expedia and Priceline as evidenced by its recent purchases, directing more traffic to its own branded metasearch site could be a smart strategy by TZOO in ultimately becoming an attractive acquisition candidate if it so chooses.In reading the comments on the last quarterly conference call, the company does mention that they see a significant opportunity for growth in the Getaway hotels offering and most importantly it appears they are addressing exactly what I mentioned as an issue I saw when I visited their site:ConclusionIt's obvious that TZOO is being punished for its slowing/falling revenue growth. After posting 35% revenue growth in 2011, revenues are expected to be flat to slightly up for 2012 and the most recent quarter experienced an 8% drop in revenues. The push that Google has made into the online travel space is affecting their business, as is the fiercely competitive local deals market in which it operates. So now it becomes an issue of what price is good enough for an investment.The company does differentiate itself somewhat in that it offers more than just local deals (it also offers the ability to book travel) and its deals do appear to be somewhat higher quality than those you would see on Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). However, the real opportunity lies in monetizing its huge user base of 25 million and 30 million unique visitors per month. It currently generates roughly 2.9% of the entire US travel search traffic.When comparing the amount of traffic it generates with larger competitors and taking into account relative market caps of each company, it certainly seems like TZOO is cheap. TZOO has a market cap to percent of visits of 107 vs. an industry average of 886, has roughly half the total number of monthly unique visitors of TripAdvisor with a valuation of 1/20th of it, has 20% of its market cap in cash, and has a price-to-sales and price to free cash flow of half of the industry average.Part of the issue with its valuation is clearly that it is unable to monetize its assets (i.e., traffic and users) as well as the larger players. In the last quarterly conference call, the company talked about this, so it is pretty clear that it understands this and is addressing it:CEO Chris Loughlin:While monetization is an issue, generating traffic is not. And for the bigger players that have learned how to monetize traffic successfully, it's easy to see why Travelzoo could be attractive as an acquisition candidate.Given the relative valuation and recent industry consolidation, I don't see how larger competitors or a company like Yahoo (YHOO) (a significant player in the space with a 4.44% market share) would not find value in the traffic that TZOO generates, especially at what appears to be a very cheap valuation, in an effort to combat Google. A significant amount of Travelzoo's traffic is off boarded to a multitude of OTAs like Expedia, Orbitz, etc. By purchasing the site, a buyer would be able to direct all of its traffic to its own website and add a good chunk of the overall market at a very cheap price. Even at twice the current price, the company appears to be cheap. The market appears to have more than adequately priced in the recent short-term drop in revenues.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in TZOO, OWW, EXPE over the next 72 hours.

On October 12, in a rare move showing TZOO's possible new direction to financial transparency, the company issued a press release outlining a miss on analysts' projected Q3 revenue and earnings. The stock dropped nearly 15% as a result.Chris Loughlin, TZOO's current CEO, reiterated his belief in the company's strategy. This is hard for us to believe given his track record. We think that the controlling shareholder, Dr. Ralph Bartel, has done little to help minority shareholder value. One example of this is the separation of Travelzoo Asia Pacific from the public company TZOO through a ""licensing"" arrangement which is outlined in the following 8K filed with the SEC. There was no strategic need for this separation and it is now an expensive litigation distraction for the company. Another example of shareholder value destruction is stubborn TZOO litigation regarding its true capitalization stemming from its merger with its affiliate Travelzoo.com back in 2002. The following excerpt from another 8k filed with the SEC briefly highlights the event: ""...the 2002 merger of Travelzoo.com Corporation, a Bahamas corporation, into the Company. In exchange for such release, the Company is making a one-time cash payment to the State of Delaware of $20 million.""Actions like those outlined above attract aggressive short-sellers who bet against the company. This has been an ongoing activity for the last decade and a half with TZOO making their stock extremely volatile. We respectfully ask Dr. Bartel to communicate with his fellow shareholders in a more constructive manner and describe what his intention is for the company he founded and actively controls.An interesting TZOO metric we have followed closely for quite a while is the short interest as a percentage of the float. The last reported number by NASDAQ on 9/28/12 is 2,370,290 with a days to cover ratio of 20.21. The number of shares short has consistently dropped over the last year from 5,128,797 to its current level. The days to cover has done the reverse by nearly doubling from 12.9. This is a direct result of the waning volume in TZOO shares. Total number of shares outstanding in TZOO as of 8/1/12 was 15,961,553 of which Dr. Bartel owns 53.3%, or approximately 8.5 million. The shares short to the float ratio is 31.8% which is still relatively high but down significantly from its elevated levels earlier this year. We think a high short interest to float ratio is an asset for a company with a clean balance sheet and could be a key tool if used properly by TZOO.We suggest the following immediate steps to stop the downward spiral and take advantage of the remaining strengths in this name:1. Stop the share repurchase agreement and reallocate the capital to build a real mobile platform to embrace the ""social travel space"" which none of TZOO's peers have been able to capture as of yet according to Erik Rannala, co-founder of Muckerlab and former vice president of product management and strategy at TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) on a recent podcast of This Week In Startups.2. Raise capital from a private equity shop to fund real growth and reduce Dr. Bartel's majority position. We know this is highly unlikely which leads us to number three.3. Stop rumors in the media of hiring a M&A banker by hiring one and formally announcing a process to explore your strategic options. We stand ready to suggest a perfect ""boutique investment bank"" in New York city who would like the assignment.The landscape is changing quickly. Priceline (PCLN) just launched mobile ""Express Deals"" for ""hotel booking option is now available for travelers with iPhone, iPod touch and Android devices, and those who access the mobile version of priceline.com's website."" TZOO also inserted this in the press release linked above: ""Travelzoo discloses that the Company is in active negotiations to acquire a hotel booking website."" We suggest that this may be ""too little, too late"" to stem the tide in dwindling revenues. We think more R&D spending to build better apps for your existing customer base and looking for a better strategic option will benefit all shareholders in the long run.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

925061,36281,2012-10-15T15:06:41-04:00,,"As a value investor, I am constantly on the lookout for companies that are currently under-priced in the market relative to their future prospects for growth. As part of my search for such companies, I pay close attention to ones which have recently had a large drop in price due to a specific negative event. Often times such drops could be a good entry point to take a position if you believe the long term prospects are still good and the bad news is just a short term difficulty.One such company that came on my radar the end of last week was Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO). On Friday morning October 12th the company issued a warning statement that its 3rd quarter sales and earnings would be lower than expected. The company expects sales to be around $35 million with earnings of $0.21/share. Both figures were lower than analyst estimates - about 11% and 23% respectively. The market responded on Friday and the stock was down about 14%.If you happen to have read some of my previous focus articles, you may know that I often use a 10 point system to evaluate companies. In this article I will evaluate Travelzoo. I have scored the company a 7 out of 10 in my system. As I advocate to only consider buying a company which scores an 8 or higher, Travelzoo does not make the cut and I do not believe it presents a compelling value for several reasons which I'll outline below in detail.Note: For more information on my investing philosophy please check out my profile or website linked above.Company BackgroundTravelzoo is an internet travel company which publishes deals from travel and entertainment companies. The company was founded in 1998, and has a market cap of about $320m. It operates travelzoo.com, as well as several other websites in various countries in North America and Europe. The company also operates fly.com and SuperSearch, which are search engines to help customers find the best flights and travel packages. More than 2000 companies use Travelzoo to advertise travel and entertainment packages and deals. There are 24 million subscribers to the company's newsletters as well as millions of website users.Travelzoo has numerous competitors which have similar offerings. Several of the best known include: Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), Priceline (PCLN), TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), and Kayak Corporation (NASDAQ:KYAK).Circle of CompetenceFor any company that I evaluate, I first assess how competent I am in understanding the business. As part of my 10 point system referenced above, I assign a value between 0 and 2 points for this. I won't go into detail of my methodology here, but for Travelzoo I have assigned this at 75%, or 1.5 points. I'm a regular user of travel search engines and deal sites such as Travelzoo, and I'm also an IT professional and very familiar with internet technologies.Score: 75% - (1.5 out of 2pts)Magic Formula ScreenFor those who are not aware of what the ""magic formula"" is, this is a stock ranking system created by value investor Joel Greenblatt. The methodology was first described in Greenblatt's The Little Book that Beats the Market. Details about his methodology including the screens can be found at his website. I won't go into detail here on the methods described in his book, but the basic premise is to find companies with a high earnings yield (measured by EBIT/EV) relative to the Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) that they produce. So you are screening for ""good"" companies at ""bargain"" prices. If you check out the website above you can sign up for free and view the current screens. Following my philosophy, I often check the top 50 stocks over $50 million in market cap and the top 50 over $1 billion in market cap as a starting point for stocks to analyze.After the drop in price this past week, Travelzoo has recently entered the top 50 over $50 million screen. This tells me that the company has very good internal return rates based on results of the previous year, and also that the market price is very cheap relative to the earnings the company generates. In this sense, the screen has been good in alerting me of the price drop. However the screen is looking at last year's results, so now we need to examine the business prospects and other factors to see whether the company deserves to be cheaply priced or not.Score: 100% - (2 out of 2pts)Business ProspectsOnline travel sales continue to grow much faster than country GDP rates. This report states that even in the US where the market is quite mature already, online travel sales will grow at a CAGR of 7.2% from 2011 to 2016. Today more than 38% of travel planning in the US is done online, and some travel agents predict that in the coming 10 years this could increase substantially to nearly 75% in the US market. In recent years starting with the great recession in 2008 - 2009, growth rates slowed considerably to single digits. However now with the explosion in smartphone and tablet adoption many expect growth rates might be faster than previously anticipated.I think in general the business prospects for this industry are still quite good, there will be overall decent growth rates in the coming 5-10 years. Indeed the few analysts that cover Travelzoo have lofty growth estimates of 20% year over year. Similar estimates also exist for the main competitors.Score: 100% - (1 out of 1pt)Shareholder FriendlyI believe it is important to assess how well a company's management has shareholder interests in mind, as this always can have a large impact on the return you will receive for your investment over time. In the case of Travelzoo, the company does not pay a dividend. There is however very high levels of insider ownership, over 50%, which is generally a positive to better align the interests of management with common shareholders. In this particular case, the founder Ralph Bartel owns 53% of the company and effectively controls the company as he can elect the board of directors himself. This could be a risk for common shareholders as they do not have much say in the strategic direction of the company. Another point is that the company does from time to time repurchase some stock to offset equity compensation given to management, but I would like to see a more consistent and sustained effort of share repurchases. The repurchases have been small and inconsistent.Score: 50% - (0.5 out of 1pt)MoatOne of the bigger issues I have with Travelzoo is the economic moat around the business appears to be quite weak. There is a lot of competition in this space, and Travelzoo is not the largest player. Expedia and Priceline are much larger businesses and have stronger competitive advantages due to scale. Travelzoo recently launched the Local Deals service as an additional growth avenue, but this service is very similar to what Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) offers. As with any internet based business the barriers to entry are quite low as well so more competitors can pop up at any time. The company states in the 10-K section that they also compete for advertising dollars with internet portal sites such as MSN from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Yahoo (YHOO).Recently I wrote in an SA article about Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) that one of the keys to having a competitive advantage for consumer technology companies is to provide a product which has compelling usability. Generally, this is what has propelled the most successful internet companies to grow their user bases substantially faster than the competition. Some excellent examples besides Apple would be Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). These websites were from the start very user friendly for the average consumer and they caught on because the usability was obviously far superior to competitors. Although Travelzoo has a decent website, and their mobile version is also quite OK, when I clicked around a bit and did some searching, I did not find it to be substantially different or better than any of the competitors. With this lack of visible economic moat around the business, it is very hard to know for sure how well the company will fare in the coming 10 years - this is surely a negative against my philosophy to avoid too much downside risk.Score: 0% - (0 out of 1pt)Conservatively FinancedWith this criteria, I look at whether there are any risks to the financial health of the company. Travelzoo has a debt/equity ratio of 0. This is one of the bigger attractions to the company, as it has been debt free the past 10 years. There is also $54m in cash.Score: 100% - (1 out of 1pt)Predictable EarningsI like to look at how predictable and dependable a company's earnings have been in the past. Generally, I do not like to invest in wildly cyclical businesses.Travelzoo has seen some fluctuation in earnings over the past 10 years. Sales have increased substantially from $9.85m in 2002 to $148m in 2011. However earnings as well as cash flow have been much less predictable. Earnings were as high as $1.01/share in 2006, but dipped all the way to $0.20/share in 2011. It should be noted that the outstanding share count has remained relatively flat during that period as well. This unpredictability makes it much more difficult for me as an investor to feel comfortable making accurate projections of future earnings.Score: 0% - (0 out of 1pt)ValuationTo calculate whether the current price constitutes a sufficient margin of safety, I have compared the current valuation of Travelzoo against its major competitors in terms of EV/EBITDA. Normally I would do a DCF model to come up with an intrinsic value for the company, however with the unpredictable earnings of the past few years I find the growth rates very difficult to estimate in this case.Here is how the company compares to its main competitors:Travelzoo is definitely priced cheaper than its competitors by a large margin. Interestingly, if you look at the analysts estimates for these 4 companies, the 5 year EPS growth estimates are all similar. Travelzoo, Priceline and Kayak are all around 20% yoy growth, and Expedia is 13%.Purely from a valuation perspective, Travelzoo is attractively priced.Score: 100% - (1 out of 1pt)ConclusionTravelzoo has scored a 7 out of 10 in my system, so I will not recommend it as a buy. I only consider to buy companies that I score at least an 8.In conclusion I believe that Travelzoo's biggest weakness is that it lacks any compelling competitive moat. Although the general prospects for growth in the industry are quite good, I don't have enough confidence in the business to be sure that it is well positioned for the long term. Also I do not like the unpredictable earnings history, which does not match well with the solid revenue growth. In my opinion there are many better companies out there which are more worthy of your investment dollars.Disclosure: I am long AAPL, MSFT.

925971,25120,2012-10-16T04:46:04-04:00,,"Shares of Travelzoo (TZOO) lost almost 15% on Friday. The global internet company, which focuses on travel, entertainment and local deals, reported preliminary third quarter results.Third Quarter ResultsTravelzoo reported preliminary third quarter revenues of $35.0-$35.5 million. The revenue outlook compares to third quarter revenues of $38.7 million in 2011, and 2012's second quarter revenues of $39.4 million. Analysts expected the company to report third quarter revenues of $38.9 million. As such, revenues are expected to fall 9.0% on an annual basis, and 10.6% on a sequential basis. The warning of sequential revenue declines exceeding 10% is severe, given that many of Travelzoo's competitors, continue to see strong revenue growth.Travelzoo expects to report third quarter earnings of $0.20-$0.22 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.36 in the third quarter of 2011, and earnings per share of $0.45 in the second quarter of 2012. On average, analysts expected the firm to report earnings of $0.27 per share.The company furthermore announced that it is in negotiations to acquire a hotel booking website.Travelzoo's current offering differ from offerings of other online travel agencies. Hotels first need to be tested and approved by Travelzoo's own experts, thereby limiting the choice to customers.The company has over 25 million subscribers across the globe and it publishes deals for more than 2,000 travel and entertainment companies.ValuationTravelzoo ended its second quarter of its fiscal 2012 with $54.2 million in cash and equivalents. The company operates without any debt for a comfortable net cash position. Travelzoo announced in July that it will repurchase roughly 1 million shares with its strong cash balance.For the first six months of 2012, the company generated revenues of $78.7 million. The company reported a net profit of $11.0 million, or $0.69 per diluted share. Based on the preliminary third quarter update, the company is on track to report annual revenues around $150 million. Annual earnings could come in around $17-$18 million, or around $1.10 per diluted share.After Friday's sell-off, the market values the firm at $320 million. Excluding the net cash position of $55 million, this values the operating assets at $265 million. This implies a valuation of 1.8 times annual revenues for the operating assets, and 15 times annual earnings.Travelzoo does not pay a dividend.Investment ThesisYear to date, shares of Travelzoo have fallen some 20%. Shares started the year at $25 and quickly peaked at $30 per share in January. Shares gradually lost ground hitting lows of $20 during the summer months. In recent weeks shares recovered to $24 per share, but fell back now exchanging hands at $20 per share.Over the past five years, shares are trading largely unchanged, but have witnessed tremendous volatility in the meantime. Shares traded as low as $5 in 2009 and almost hit $100 per share in 2011. Between 2008 and 2012 the company has aggressively grown its business. Revenues almost doubled from $81 million in 2008, to an expected $150 million this year. The company turned a $4 million loss for 2008, into an expected profit of $17-$18 million in 2012.Travelzoo employs a different strategy compared to some of its major competitors which include Expedia (EXPE), Kayak (KYAK) Priceline.com (PCLN) and Tripadvisor (TRIP). The company is much smaller in size compared to these competitors and only includes offerings based on certification of its own ""travel experts.""What's worrying is that the company guides for revenues to fall over 10% both on a sequential basis, as well as year-on-year. As the company admitted itself, the strategy is not working. The failure of Travelzoo's strategy is the main reason behind the plans to buy a hotel booking website. Given the much smaller size of the company it is questionable whether it is able to buy a respectable online name. Furthermore, there is always the matter of making an acquisition at a right price.While the company's valuation might look relatively appealing to competitors, shares are dangerously expensive. Given the very competitive field out there, the company runs the risk of getting killed by competition. I doubt the company's ability to turn the tide.I am staying on the sidelines. An outright short position might be risky as a major competitor might be willing to acquire Travelzoo in order to boost their offerings.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In January, Lanvin, the famous fashion house announced that Ralph Bartel, founder and majority shareholder of TZOO had increased his stake in the storied fashion house to 25%.On July 11th, the Real Deal Real Estate site wrote that Bartel had purchased 144 Spring Street in New York City's famed SoHo district with the intention of housing Lanvin in this prestigious location. It is the last vacant lot available to build upon in SoHo.Its also interest to note that Lanvin is run by Alber Elbaz, who was formerly at Gucci and has resurrected the Lanvin brand since his recruitment by Chinese media baroness and controlling Lanivn shareholder, Mrs. Shaw-Lan Wang. Wang was interviewed by the Financial Times in February 2012.Given the Chinese activities of Travelzoo Asia Pacific and the common shareholding of Lanvin, we think there may be more to this unfolding relationship between Bartel and Wang.Lets us suggest one possible outcome which may come from this burgeoning relationship. Bartel could use a Reverse Morris Trust to merge Travelzoo with Lanvin in a tax efficient transaction for TZOO shareholders. In addition, Wang could also fold in some of her media properties to beef up the enterprise and take advantage of the TZOO Internet expertise and extend both brands to their vast subscribers in Asia.Bartel may even use the property in SoHo for a retail location for Travelzoo which may be a new marketing venue for the travel media business.With earnings about to be released by TZOO on July 19th and the late summer surge local deals revenue in Q2 2012 reported by Benchmark analyst Kurnos, we believe there is still a possibility for Bartel to give his minority shareholders a positive surprise soon.Disclosure: I am long TZOO."

With an earnings ""beat"" and the possibility of a strategic deal which could be still in pursuit, we believe management's announcement of a new growth initiative starting in Q3 2012 could be a tool in their negotiations. With the stock rallying on the news in early trading yesterday morning, the conference call threw cold water on the upbeat news. Why? They completely botched their opportunity to give a clear path to their potentially exciting future.CEO Chris Loughlin has limited credibility with the street and seems nervous and defensive on the last two conference calls. Simply put, he is not a good communicator with the financial community. We suggest TZOO start a process for a new CEO who will be able to stand up to Ralph Bartel and his death grip on the company. We also suggest they put Chris Loughlin back in marketing and business development role where he belongs.Benchmark just lowered their target to $22 from $24. Ralph Bartel needs to wake up and smell the coffee. His baby needs vitamins and nourishment. We have attempted talking to him with credible financing sources in the past and he has played ""Ostrich"" with us.ChaPaVe suggestions are as follows:The share price of TZOO will continue to languish until the company executes a plan as suggested above even if they ""beat"" expectations on earnings because you have no credible growth.Unfortunately management has never accepted our invitations to meet with ChaPaVe to hear our proposals, we therefore believe investors should sell their shares in TZOO and repurchase them at much lower prices, if and only if Bartel and Travelzoo commit to do the right thing.Disclosure: I am short TZOO."
790001,25366,2012-08-08T10:26:34-04:00,,"In light of the downward guidance projections announced last night by Priceline (PCLN), we think that Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) should rethink its growth strategy. We have reported on Seeking Alpha in previous articles on the control person discount at TZOO and how it has hampered the true opportunity in Travelzoo shares. We urge investors caution on any TZOO share purchases until there is a real commitment for non-organic growth initiatives to launch the company to the next level or other alternatives as we outlined in our last article. No company can maintain or grow their share price without a growth initiative that sophisticated investors can believe in and track.To be sure, the smart and time efficient way to demonstrate tremendous user growth is by integrating into larger platforms such as AOL (AOL) or Facebook (FB) . This is a strategy that founder and controlling shareholder Ralph Bartel only seems willing to use in his 100% individually owned entities as demonstrated in the announced Travelzoo Lv You Zu China CYTS Tours Holding Co. Ltd. (CYTS, SSE: 600138.ss) transaction. Travelzoo Lv You Zu is owned and operated by Bartel's Travelzoo Asia Pacific which is a licensee of Travelzoo Inc, which has a ""reciprocal revenue-sharing agreement"" which is mentioned without financial detail in the company's financial reports.Travelzoo announced an ambiguous stock buyback program for up to a million shares. They did the same thing in August 2011 for 500,000 shares and ultimately paid an average of $30 per share, over $8 per share over the current price., Ralph Bartel is no stranger to using smoke and mirrors in battling the shorts in Travelzoo dating back to the late 90's. Short interest has dropped again for the fifth consecutive reporting period and yet the stock continues its downward trend.

701291,25366,2012-07-04T05:56:04-04:00,,"As the volume of trading in Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) shares dries up, we feel it is becoming apparent that Electronic Communication Networks such as Instinet are in complete control of the direction and short interest in TZOO. ECNs are a topic of the book ""Broken Markets"" which describes the role of High Frequency Trading or HFT which the authors say are ruining the markets and also believe were the cause of the ""flash crash"" in May of 2010. We believe there is merit to their argument. We also believe that a flash crash could also happen in the reverse where ECNs are harboring a huge short interest in a stock such as TZOO.The authors of Broken Markets contend that these trading platforms are in virtual control of many stocks and are trading between each just like shills at a gaming table who are compensated by casinos to attract innocent unsuspecting patrons to their game of chance only to be fleeced of their disposable income. The platforms are compensated by the ECNs in the form of rebates which virtually guarantees them a profit. TZOO shares have been stuck in a very narrow trading range over the past 45 days and it seems these ECNs may be trying to reduce their exposure to a short squeeze just in case the undervalued company and its control obsessed shareholder, Ralph Bartel, make good on a rumor that they are shopping the company to strategic customers who could use the cash flow, revenue and customer base in an accretive deal.The metrics used in the recent M&A deal for Bleacher Report which sold for 5 times revenue would translate to a valuation of at least $800 million or $50 a share for TZOO not including its cash on hand. Therefore, we believe that traditional short sellers have left Travelzoo which they once saw as a bubble stock. This can be seen in the current negative rebate of 5% (the annual cost) being charged to those desiring to sell the shares short. This is a new low for the year; it hit its high at just over 100% when the shares short totaled over 5.2 million. Other stocks with a high short interest ranked by the ""days to cover"" ratio (TZOO currently stands at 15.553350) have at least double digit borrowing costs ranging from 10-25%. The drop in the cost to borrow is not in line with the drop in shares short given the increase in the days to cover ratio. We believe they are being reported as short by the ECNs who are creating the volume for HFTs.During the trading day, it is evident that many of the shares are not traded on the Nasdaq platform because they report a volume of shares traded at approximately half that reported by sites such as Yahoo and Bloomberg. Only after the market close does the total volume come into parity.In conclusion, if the markets are manipulated as Broken Markets suggests, we contend that investing in a highly shorted cash generating company with no debt can present an opportunity for aggressive investors.Disclosure: I am long TZOO."

Though the second quarter revenues were only slightly higher than the previous quarter, they registered a 5% y-o-y rise in a seasonally down quarter. While the company's North America business registered a y-o-y increase of 4%, the European segments growth rate slowed down to 7%. However, Travelzoo marked its sixth consecutive year of profitability in Europe.The travel segment in North America registered a 3% rise on account of growth in hotel business deals by Travelzoo's getaway offerings, whereas Europe registered a 8% y-o-y growth on account of sales staff added early in the quarter. Local revenue registered a significant y-o-y increase both in North America (15%) and Europe (28%), whereas the search division declined substantially for both geographies, primarily on account of Travelzoo's reduced spend on traffic and lower spending by airlines.Travelzoo has expanded its product offerings with Local Deals and Getaway, which has contributed to its growth in the last few years. Though the growth has slowed down recently, we believe it is more on account of macroeconomic trends-- such as reduced spending by airlines and online travel agencies, a harsh economic environment in Europe and intense competition, among others.We continue to believe that Local Deals and Getaway along with increased investment in product innovations will be the future growth drivers for the company. Additionally, we feel that an increase in mobile traffic and sales force ramp up will contribute both to the short-term as well as long-term topline growth for the company.See our full analysis of TravelzooGrowth In Mobile TrafficIn recent years, the emergence of alternate platforms – such as smartphones and tablets – have registered significant growth, which is expected to continue at a rapid pace in the years ahead. Targeting the mobile travel space, Travelzoo's mobile platform across iPhones, Android and others, is now live in all countries.As a result, the company has registered a significant increase in its mobile traffic, from 10% an year ago to the current level of 25%. The mobile download count almost doubled to 1 million downloads, with approximately 5000 people a day downloading the Travelzoo application.Sales Force Ramp Up To Contribute To The Topline GrowthWith a robust management and growing sales force, Travelzoo deals are now reaching around 125 markets and almost half the purchases are made by repeat buyers. Additionally, growth in new subscribers this quarter has helped the company reach closer to the 25 million subscribers milestone.Travelzoo claims to be on track with its goal of hiring 50 additional sales staff, set at the end of Q1 2012, while focusing on maintaining productivity at the same time.Stimulating its top line growth by further investing in sales, headcounts and marketing is one of Travelzoo's strategic elements with which it plans to spur future growth, and we believe that the company has been faring well so far.We are in the process of updating our current price estimate of $30.38.Disclosure: No positions"

We see large companies are looking to increase their social media and especially social mobile platform capabilities. We believe the pool of potential acquirers for Travelzoo Inc. (NASDAQ:TZOO) has increased. We believe that stories reported by Reuters in April about TZOO mulling a sale are have merit if and only if founder Ralph Bartel is honest in his intentions to do what's right for all Travelzoo shareholders.The current price to a strategic buyer really has no bearing on what a willing buyer is prepared to pay for such an enterprise. Different buyers with specific goals will pay different multiples of different metrics.A telling statistic that may reveal that a deal maybe in the works is the reduced short interest in Travelzoo, although its still a very high ratio to the float with increasing ""days to cover"" number as well. Some former shorts must believe a deal is in the works.Private equity shops, the most unlikely buyers for TZOO, will pay on a multiple of EBITDA. In this case, taking TZOO's most recent quarter, they generated $9.9 million in free cash flow, according to their presentation. Even the most aggressive PE shops would not view the current valuation as compelling for a buyout unless the growth story, like the one we have articulated in several articles, is clearly defined and cost savings can be quantified such that a $42+ share bid, something that might entice Ralph, looks like a stretch. So this is clearly the more difficult pool of potential bidders.Strategic buyers, such as industry leaders, including Priceline.com (PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), are also bottom feeders and probably are not the buyers because they know that Ralph would never want to sell at the current price levels. However they can always pay up for the stock using their lofty currencies as the main consideration for a deal.The unusual suspects are companies like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) who are getting serious about social media platforms as enabler for vertical integration of their customer bases. These may include floundering but cash rich WebMD (NASDAQ:WBMD) or AOL (NYSE:AOL), who have large customer bases and can benefit from the cash generating business model that TZOO has developed. But lets get more creative with companies who are in search of reinventing themselves: Sears Holdings (SHLD) or J.C. Penney (JCP).Even further out of the box are disruptors such as Dish Networks (NASDAQ:DISH) who wants to control the advertising dollars and give more value to their customers. They could easily create a streaming Travel channel that shows their advertisers products as entertainment. This sort of content popularity can be seen in Foodnetwork.com's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.There are many lucrative options for TZOO. An auction needs at least ten buyers in a pool for a great result. There are many more than ten potential acquirers of this company. The real question is what does Ralph Bartel want to do. We urge him to continue this auction process and make something happen to please the minority shareholders of Travelzoo.Disclosure: I am long TZOO."

In fact, many Seeking Alpha contributors are bearish on Groupon amid broader street negativity surrounding the company. This negative perception seems to be overflowing into the downward drift in shares of Travelzoo. We recommend buying Travelzoo at these low prices especially as we head into their earnings report on April 19th. Bespoke Investment Group outlines the historical volatility of TZOO shares leading up to its earnings release dates. The pre-earnings period is traditionally a good time to get long Travelzoo. We feel the compression of Travelzoo shares associated with Groupon's troubles makes this an especially compelling time to be long.The TZOO team has been conservative in its growth approach and the stock has been punished for it. We have urged the company and its founder to be more aggressive in its growth strategy and still believe there are more partnering opportunities for their deals space. We feel the time is now to seize on the troubles at Groupon and increase market-share by aggressively pursuing a merger or acquisition to cement Travelzoo's competence and consumer loyalty in the high end deals marketplace. The platform they have built is under-utilized and should be given more customers and deals to drive both top line and bottom line growth.We have reported on the revenue to market-cap ratio disparity between Groupon and Travelzoo in the past. It is this disparity that provides the basis for the compelling hedge to shorting Groupon with buying Travelzoo. But beware, Groupon shares are currently in high demand to borrow for shorting with a negative 34% annual rebate.We have just received the proxy notice announcing the annual meeting in New York on May 18th, 2012 presumably at TZOO's office. We surmise that they do not believe many shareholders will be there given the limited space in their offices on Madison Avenue. We encourage all shareholders to attend and ask what is the real growth plans for the company.Disclosure: I am long TZOO."

That being said, I've also disclosed how much I like Tripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP). Today, I wanted to take a deeper look at Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) which has a fairly unique business compared to other players.The main difference is that I think Travelzoo's business is a nice mix between Priceline (PCLN) and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). It is able to provide local deals to the million of mailing list members that it has accumulated over the years. I do think that it is much more focused than Groupon (resulting in lower costs) and there are fewer questions regarding its accounting practices, etc. That has helped TZOO generate strong growth for many years now. The other major point is that while Groupon and others spend millions to acquire clients, Travelzoo has been more of a word of mouth thing which certainly makes it much easier to become profitable.In other ways though, Travelzoo is able to provide web properties such as its Fly.com search engine that make it easier for users to search for a specific deal. It's not quite the ""Name Your Price"" brand, but it is still very strong and getting better. From everything that I can tell, Travelzoo is a very well run company in a sector where growth continues to be strong. It has strong relationships with many of the top travel brands in the world.Click to enlargeValuation EstimatesDepending on whose earnings per share estimates you use, the P/E estimates for 2012 and 2013 are close to 15 and 13. That is a fairly attractive valuation for a company that is expected to increase its revenues by double digits for the next few years at a minimum. The company has a very strong balance sheet with no debt and significant cash (close to $2.50 per share). I personally think it is a very attractive valuation!Travelzoo's EPSEconomic Environment ChallengesNo doubt, the fact that Travelzoo has a large portion of its business in the UK is a challenge as that economy continues to go through a weak recovery.That being said, I think that what Travelzoo offers is fairly unique and difficult to replicate which will certainly continue to offer a lot of good opportunities for the company. So a buying opportunity? Without question."

We have highlighted the burgeoning conflict between the interests of minority shareholders and the controlling shareholder, founder and director Ralph Bartel.The silence and non communication from Mr. Bartel reminds us of an Ostrich sticking its head in the sand.Our advice to Mr.Bartel is that this approach is not worth its lure. In December, we disclosed to Mr.Bartel a financial partner which had expressed an interest in working with us and him in a strategic transaction. Mr.Bartel declined to meet. As we have reported before, the values of TZOO peers such as TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) and Priceline.com (PCLN) have far superior (3x) market caps relative to their top-line sales revenue. This is primarily due to the TZOO control shareholder discount.Our suggestions are to pursue alliances with bigger entities, such as AOL (NYSE:AOL), who are in need of profitable businesses to add to their large but underutilized platforms.Or in the alternative, Mr.Bartel can open up the books on the Asia Pacific assets he has sequestered for himself and show us what's going on there; TZOO shareholders have an ""interested party"" right to this information because Asia Pacific assets are subject to a royalty agreement with Travelzoo.A simple way to expedite this process is to structure a deal where Bartel would receive a fair number of options in Travezool shares with a strike at the current price which using the Black-Scholes model would reflect the value of the Asia Pacific property. This transaction would be handled between the independent directors of TZOO and Bartel.This deal would need a fairness opinion from an investment bank. In this case, with a hyper growth strategy in place, the shares should rise and the value for minority shareholders as well as Mr.Bartel can be shared mutually.Disclosure: I am long TZOO."
380781,25366,2012-02-21T15:14:07-05:00,,"We have written in the past of the discount placed on Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) shares stemming from excessive short interest in the stock caused by the iron grip of its controlling shareholder and founder. We now ask if the scenario that exists in TZOO is a perfect environment for famed hedge fund disciples of Julian Robertson of Tiger Management known as the ""Tiger Cubs."" These well-trained managers have been known to ferret out opportunities like this ""coiled spring"" cash generating company. In fact, they would be joining Edward C. Johnson 3rd from FMR LLC with their current holdings of 1.39 million TZOO shares.Certainly the stage is set for a classic meteoric rise in share price like the one recently seen in Sears Holding (SHLD) and the international thriller seen in the Porsche Volkswagen saga in 2008, ultimately bankrupting famous German industrialist Adolf Merckle. The negative rebate (interest rate equivalent ) in TZOO is hovering around 40% annually for these hard to borrow shares needed for traders to sell short. This is down from a much higher rate earlier this year. In fact, the reduction in the negative rebate is a signal of a slight loosening of shares to borrow for those who want to sell short and may be causing the recent downdraft in the stock. It seems short sellers are again desperately trying to depress the TZOO shares to scare off prospective investors.TZOO has no risky debt instruments on its balance sheet and therefore no default issues or pending implosion often seen in highly shorted stocks.Travelzoo is a growing business that's a hybrid of TripAdvisors (NASDAQ:TRIP) and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), albeit a niche player in those market segments and trading at a fraction of the peers' sales-to- market-cap multiples. The most recent short interest number tells us that there are still many traders betting against TZOO, possibly for only one reason - the controlling shareholder discount. We believe that this reason may actually be the catalyst minority shareholders can look to rebound their stock's value. In reality, this control shareholder can be seen as a backstop in the case of a squeeze because of his desire to hold the majority of TZOO. We have written of other possibilities to unleash value at TZOO that the control shareholder could single-handedly embark on as well. But if he does absolutely nothing, it might just be the perfect setup for the next big melt up.Disclosure: I am long TZOO."

Last week, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) took an extraordinary action upon one of its founders, Kazau Okada, who allegedly violated certain laws and is in direct competition with Wynn Resorts.Ralph Bartel has come under scrutiny regarding some of his activities surrounding Travelzoo where he is also a director. We question whether the independent Directors of Travelzoo have the resolve to investigate whether or not Mr. Bartel has violated any corporate requirements which may make his shares subject to redemption. In the case of Okada, the redemption was made possible by the Articles of Incorporation and Shareholders Agreements in place at Wynn Resorts since its inception. The lawyers pursuing the case against Mr. Bartel will likely be entitled to the pertinent documents of Travelzoo to see if the possibility for such a process exists here.Of course, Mr. Bartel can make this entire issue go away and transfer Travelzoo's Asia Pacific assets to Travelzoo. This would give himself and the minority shareholders in Travelzoo the growth strategy we need to fuel the company forward. In addition, this would eliminate the costly litigation distraction Travelzoo is experiencing.Certainly, a redemption of this nature would benefit minority shareholders and remove the shareholder control discount and free current management to pursue more aggressive growth strategies to unleash value and let the share price move in line with its peers Groupon, Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN), Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) and priceline.com Incorporated (PCLN) revenue to marketcap multiple.Moreover, traders who are betting against the company may have to cover their short positions in light of the reduction in shares outstanding after the redemption. The redemption of shares via a low interest bearing long term unsecured note such as the one Wynn Resorts issued to Kazua Okada would be beneficial to Travelzoo minority shareholders by immediately increasing its earnings per share.Disclosure: I am long TZOO."

They clearly have a vision for the company but have difficulty gaining acceptance by an impatient investor base. They do know how to effectively manage their cash flow to produce earnings, perhaps at the cost of potentially higher growth.It is clear to us that management is constrained by its cash resources which their competitors abundantly have. This is the result of their majority shareholder's fixation on control of the company at the expense of constraining expansion. This could also be contributing to the large short-interest in TZOO.With the combination of AOL, Inc. (NYSE:AOL), as we have suggested recently, we believe this management team could significantly grow their business in the bigger ""sandbox"" without the use of debt and return cash to their investor base by selling non-core assets.Another observation we made is the lack of information of licensing income from the Asian market. It could be where pure profits are dropping to the bottom line for the company and is being overlooked as a real sweet spot for the company without the need for capex or additional headcount.Recent price action in TZOO clearly shows that an earnings beat can be bittersweet if you can't articulate your growth plan. We believe the AOL combination would solve this problem.Management must present a credible growth plan which investors believe for Travelzoo to achieve its potential.We created ChaPaVe Partners and the Tactical Tender Offer to align minority shareholders' interests with controlling shareholders' interests. We know these companies are often very independent and therefore often overlooked by activist investors.

A retail broker's cost to borrow was at a negative 45% with larger availability and one prime broker was at negative 15% with more availability than the previous week. We believe that a new ""supply"" of shares for shorting has resulted in the recent downward movement in TZOO. Could Ralph Bartel or another large shareholder, FMR LLC, be lending these scarce shares to encourage short sales in Travelzoo? At first blush, this sounds counter intuitive. But it may just be the ""tease to the squeeze"". The owner of shares sold short can recall their shares if they are not on margin.Recently, we approached a well-known corporate activist investor to join our cause in Travelzoo. Although intrigued by the set of facts we presented, he shied away for two reasons: First is the ""control shareholder"" situation we have explained previously. Second is the ""short squeeze"" dilemma: will the shorts who get squeezed ""cry foul"" as they did in the Porsche/VW saga back in 2008? To this concern, we embarked on our mission to report available information and pose possible scenarios in our articles to fully vet the possibility of a squeeze in ""broad daylight"" thereby rendering a cry for foul play a non issue.Sometimes short-sellers sell stock in a tough to borrow stock like TZOO just because they can; sudden price drops scare away potential new investors. The lending of shares is not a fully transparent activity. In fact, several days ago, a closely watched case involving this activity at Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) had a turn of events. It involves a paranoid CEO of a heavily shorted, unprofitable company who is claiming foul. That is not the significance of this case. What is significant is the visibility of the inner workings of the ""hard to borrow"" desks at these institutions.We are not against aggressive short selling practices. These traders provide liquidity to the marketplace. They can be right or they can be wrong. We actively analyze this practice for anomalies.We remain long on TZOO and encourage Ralph Bartel to heed our requests. We suggest Mr. Bartel take a hard look at Eddie Lampert's activity at Sears Holdings (SHLD). Eddie has a much tougher situation on his hands and is making lemonade from lemons. Just imagine what could be done at Travelzoo if Bartel was as enterprising and creative as Eddie.Disclosure: I am long TZOO."
357651,25366,2012-02-10T10:51:02-05:00,,"Recently, we have suggested that Travelzoo Inc. (NASDAQ:TZOO) get serious about growth and take the company to the next level. In light of Groupon's (NASDAQ:GRPN) earnings that show growth but unforeseen losses, Travelzoo has the ability distinguish itself with its profitable strategy if it can develop a sustainable growth plan.The challenge is to articulate a plan that does not conflict with the controlling shareholders agenda of continued control with conservative balance sheet management; not a perfect combination with a high growth initiative.Travelzoo and AOL Inc. (NYSE:AOL) could merge their ""Local Deals"" s units. AOL calls theirs Patch Deals. The companies have worked together in the past in Germany and presumably still have each other's contact information. With or without AOL's Patch, Travelzoo can spin off its Local Deals business and make it a pure play windfall to shareholders. We saw the successful result in such a deal at Expedia,Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPE) and TripAdvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) which has created tremendous value for Expedia shareholders. Even a controlling shareholder may like this strategy. We know TZOO has said many times it doesn't want to be a Groupon competitor, but we really think they are just afraid of the capital burn associated with the challenge. Yes, the local deals space is crowded, but TZOO is good at it and they should be given the resources to expand it under this new pure play strategy.As far as valuation, the companies seem to be on different planets with Travelzoo being more fit for liftoff. Groupon announced 2011 annual revenue of $1.6 billion and a market cap of approximately $13.5 billion with Travelzoo generating about $158 million in 2011 revenue with a $419 million market cap, which is just 3% of Groupn's as Jeremy Bowman at Motley Fool reveals. Travelzoo has less than 1/3 the multiple to revenues for its market cap than that of Groupon. Given the irregularly high ratio of 4.2 milion shares short in Travelzoo's 7.5 million share float, one must conclude that TZOO shares are certainly in need of recalibration.We created ChaPaVe Partners and the Tactical Tender Offer to align minority shareholders' interests with controlling shareholders' interests.

295922,24546,2011-09-26T11:35:57-04:00,,"Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) has been seeding a daily deals business over the past year (think Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN)). This business saw satisfactory success (consumer acceptance) but lacked scale. Based largely on excitement surrounding this business, the stock reached a high of $103.80 intraday in April of this year, only to crater down to $24 today. Last quarter's results disappointed investors as the business didn't grow as much as expected and costs to seed this business exceeded expectations. Historically, this business didn't have the scale or the human resources to offer deals as often as Groupon or Living Social. Average Travelzoo deals were often bigger (think average price of $60 vs. $10 or so for Groupon) and more exciting. This derives from Travelzoo's heritage of offering discounted complete travel packages. However, deals only appeared in different locations on an intermittent basis. In other words, New York or Portland or Philadelphia would see a deal one week and no other deal would be available to local subscribers in that city for another two weeks. There was no consistency to the offerings as the backlog of deals wasn't there to have a steady offering of deals. Consumers likely didn't pay much attention to Travelzoo deals because they came around infrequently. To remedy this situation, salespeople had to be added to generate interest among local businesses to list with Travelzoo's deals platform. In adding those people, costs accelerated last quarter, while deal flow didn't pick up yet. The following charts shows the ramp-up in employees at Travelzoo and the corresponding impact on revenue per employee. (source)   In a huge development for the company, and a big catalyst for the stock, the number of open deals has rocketed in the last week or so. The employees hired are becoming productive and getting deal listings. Deal flow has exploded for Travelzoo which means it is much more likely to achieve scale, grow strongly and generate significant profits in this division (too late to show up in Q3 2011 but a great indicator for next year). The following is a graph showing info I have collected on deals from Travelzoo's website. It specifically shows the number of deals that are currently active, or ones that can be currently purchased (ie, not closed yet).    (All information is believed to be accurate but no warranties are made as to the veracity of the data.)   The number of deals open largely correlates to the number of new deals being offered, and not to deals being open longer. This means financial results for Travelzoo should show significant improvement in Q4 2011 and beyond. Disclosure: I am long TZOO."

Then today it gained more than 16%.The stock had been on a constant downtrend, with little gains along the way, ever since the end of April. The stock lost a significant amount of value in late April-early May as investors took profits after gains from a solid earnings report. Profit taking along with strong insider selling caused the stock to drop by large margins. Then the company missed Q2 earning expectations in July and it's been mostly a disaster ever since, for long-term investors. I personally would have never thought the stock would have reached these levels. But then again, I did not expect a 16% loss in the major indices over the last 3 months. The markets have been rough for TZOO but I believe as earnings approach the bad fortunes of this stock are about to change. Investors sold the stock after Q2 because revenue was slightly lower than expectations, EPS missed by $0.08, and costs were higher. Yet even with a missed quarter the company still increased revenue by 33.70% and grew income by 51.50%. It's difficult to find a problem with numbers such as this, and then you remember that the company has no debt, additional assets, and is expanding into a new market at 1 in every 3 days, then I believe it makes an especially difficult case to prove that TZOO is a fading company. The loss of TZOO was a result of an overvalued stock as it was trading near $100. There was no reason for a company such as this to be trading with a market cap of more than $1 billion since it's yet to post $40 million in revenue for a single quarter. The stock now has a market cap of $400 million, and I believe it's appropriate for the company's level of growth. If the company were to post a solid earnings report in Q3 and have a net income for the last 12 months it would still be trading much higher than earnings.I am a fan of TZOO and I believe the company's deals are second to none, with the company growing, and growing very fast. What investors must remember is that it takes time to hire employees, develop a region, and then profit from the region. Investors must have patience and with 27 new regions in Q2 and similar numbers in Q1 I believe the company should be seeing large profits in the near future. Also, Travelzoo is a global company that offers complex deals. The company is not offering $5 off at your local mom and pop shop, the company offers large deals that usually involve several companies working together on one deal. And the company's emphasis in Europe and the Asia/Pacific region has been a success and will produce a large volume of subscribers over time.Investors should be patient and view TZOO as a long term hold. The company has potential, and I believe that over the next 12 months the stock will easily double from the morning price as revenue and earnings continue to rise, and the market improves. When a company grows at the level of TZOO the stock rises, investors were dealt a bad hand full of unfortunate events that acted as a domino effect to the stock. Yet I believe that at $24 the stock offers a limited amount of risk and a high reward that will pay off for investors sooner rather than later.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in TZOO over the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: As with any investment, due diligence is required.

280106,24663,2011-07-19T08:44:07-04:00,,"As investors we all have a different preference and goal in purchasing stocks. Some look for a solid dividend and consistency while others would rather purchase a small company where the rewards may be greater but the fall could be harder. We all rely on different indicators to tell us the direction of a company, both long and short. Many investors only play the technicals, some only the fundamentals and others incorporate both. Yet there is one area of research and trading that is more vital than the others. It tells the investor both the current and future strength of a company.Earnings tell the ultimate story in which direction a company is going and where the company has been. Our unemployment rates stay the same, there is turmoil in the Middle East, the politicians can’t agree on the new credit card and our market is always one bad report away from a 100 point loss on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. With that being said earnings keep going up. Does it mean that our economy is in better shape than we believe? Or does it mean that online consumerism’s popularity is growing much faster than we realize. We are living in an economy where online social media can reach more people in a day than a corner store can reach in a year. A business is more effective being used on the Internet versus physical locations since expenses and maintenance are lower and profit margins are higher. The corporations who have realized these principles have thrived and those who have not are being left behind. Look at Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) most recent earnings report. Overall revenue rose 32% in Q2 which is typically the weakest quarter. Companies such as Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Priceline (PCLN), Baidu.com (NASDAQ:BIDU), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) are all major corporations which lead the pack as companies that create revenue over the Internet. There have been many companies to take advantage and grow during this era of technology while others have failed to evolve. A fast growing company whose revenue is created through online travel purchase is Travelzoo.Travelzoo Inc (NASDAQ:TZOO) is scheduled to release earnings Thursday July 21st at 11:00 AM. At the very least I expect a solid short play after the earnings report which was witnessed on April 21st. On April 20th the stock closed at $73.87, on April 25th the stock reached a high of $103.80.The first quarter  was highlighted with revenue of $37.0M, up 30% year over year. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $.37 compared to $.15 the prior year.North America saw revenue grow by 23% to $27.6 million. Europe’s business segment revenue grew 53% year-over-year to $9.4 million. As of March 31st 2011 there were 19.9 million Travelzoo subscribers worldwide.Travelzoo has given several indications throughout the current quarter of accelerated growth. On May 5th the company announced they had surpassed 23 million subscribers. A significant achievement considering the company had 19.9 million subscribers as of March 31st. I believe this to be the result of their expansion into new markets and an increase in production within their European market.On May 16th Travelzoo announced European subscribers bought $3.4 million in Local Deals during the first 45 days of the quarter, a 196% increase in sales compared to the first 45 days of Q1. Travelzoo was able to accomplish this by generating average gross revenue of $43,600 per deal as compared to $34,000 in Q1.June 8th the company announced results from two additional markets, Asia and Australia. On May 30th the company initiated a trial in Japan in which the company generated 630,000 in two days. Since April the Australian market had generated close to $1 million in gross revenue during a two month time period.I do not believe that Travelzoo has come close to matching their potential. During Q2 Travelzoo has expanded into 2 additional continents, Australia and Asia, in addition to North America and Europe. The number of subscribers are unknown within these new markets. Based on the success you have to conclude that the majority of the additional 3 million subscribers are located in these markets.The business of online travel and entertainment is expanding and there are many other corporations similar to Travelzoo who specialize in North America. Orbitz (NYSE:OWW), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Priceline.com all offer similar packages with their own unique twist. North America has a population estimated at 530 million and Travelzoo had 14.8 million subscribers as of March 31st which represents 2.79% of our population. Europe’s population is significantly greater with an estimated 733 million citizens. As of March 31st there were 5.1 million subscribers in European market, or .69%.Travelzoo has the right concept in place. The North American market may be too small to support the many companies who offer services similar to Travelzoo. Why take the chance? Europe, Asia and Australia all have large markets and based on the figures are selling more units faster.I believe Travelzoo is in the process of changing their identity as a company. I am certain they will always offer great packages in America but the data that has been given suggest more room for growth in other countries. I would not be surprised to see earnings come out on Thursday and the company to announce less revenue in North America by 5%, Europe’s revenue to increase substantially and over $2 million in revenue from there emerging markets. I expect a blow out quarter for revenue but I also expect higher costs for the company.Every indication points to a jump in price back over $100. The stock is trading in the same range as just before Q1 earnings report. The only difference is I expect this quarter to be even bigger, I expect revenue to blow away all expectations. Travelzoo is setting themselves up to be a special company. Travelzoo could become the leader in worldwide deals, the number one platform where travelers can find the best rates anywhere in the world. As a result, I expect Travelzoo to reach annual sales over $1 billion in the next five years. The stock is a good short term play, before earnings, at any price under $80 but is a strong long term play at any price under $100.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

I try to avoid any momo names on earnings for this reason, even if it means missing a big move upward post earnings. Waking up to a -22% loss is not a great way to start a morning.   That said, the rise in Travelzoo has been so spectacular, this drop to $67 has only taken the stock back to the beginning of the month. (while nicely filling that gap)  Expectations were for $39M in revenue, along with $0.38 EPS. TZOO came in light on the top line at $37.6M, while disappointing mightily on EPS at $0.30. Not a good job by management to guide analysts to the typical lowball game that almost all of Wall Street plays. They appear to be blaming the lion's share of the miss on TV advertising, but that should have been communicated better to the Street.  Full report here.Disclosure: No position"

267254,20851,2011-05-03T11:38:59-04:00,,"A good earnings report will go a long way toward improving a company's standing with investors. Take Travelzoo (Nasdaq: TZOO), for instance. After announcing earnings last Thursday the stock soared 28 percent.Some sanity has returned following the one-day run however, and Travelzoo shares are again trading in the mid $80s. But considering the 12-month analyst consensus price target is $97.80, the pullback puts shares in a reasonable trading range right now.And it's a good place for potential investors to look at buying shares. Oftentimes, a stock's price will run before the company issues earnings - then run further if investors like the results. When the stock gets ahead of itself, like Travelzoo's recently did, it will sell off. But the potential has been marked on the chart, and good companies that follow through with continued performance often see their stocks trade back to the recent highs.Travelzoo is not your typical online travel service. Unlike Priceline (Nasdaq: PCLN), Expedia (Nasdaq: EXPE) or Orbitz (NYSE: OWW), Travelzoo doesn't use much television advertising to market itself.Founded in 1998 by Chairman Ralph Bartel, Travelzoo calls itself ""a global Internet media company."" It supplies information on travel and entertainment deals that are researched and selected by its staff through email newsletters and websites. The company also has licensed the Travelzoo name for use in Asian markets, including China. Revenue is generated through advertising fees.Travelzoo, which has a market cap of $1.3 billion, is a little more like Groupon than high-roller Priceline - a stock that is trading north of $500 a share right now. And unlike its competitors, it's not caught up in a battle royal with American Airlines parent AMR Corp. (NYSE: AMR) like Orbitz is, and like Expedia was.More than 2,000 companies currently use Travelzoo services, including American and United airlines, Avis Rent A Car and Royal Caribbean cruise lines.Travelzoo had a unique launch back in the dot-com boom years. The current Chairman, Ralph Bartel, set up Travelzoo.com Corporation in the Bahamas, and then issued 5.2 million shares to some 700,000 ""Netsurfer stockholders"" for no cash consideration.Travelzoo Inc. was subsequently established in 2001, and 11.3 million of the Netsurfer shares were exchanged for those of the new entity (there are currently 16.5 million shares outstanding, with the founder controlling 10 million.)What excited investors in the first-quarter report was a 30 percent increase in revenue to $37 million. Before a one-time charge, adjusted net income was $6 million, or $0.37 per share - more than double the $0.15 EPS in the year-ago period.In the first quarter, Travelzoo reported that its Local Deals business doubled in the current 48 worldwide markets, resulting in $16.2 million in revenue. The company says its deals business has the potential to generate $780 million annually (issuing just two deals a week) if it reaches the 30-million-subscriber level in 200 global markets.That's a lofty goal, but continued progress toward it would almost certainly move the stock above its recent highs.During the first quarter, Travelzoo announced that it has achieved two notable subscriber plateaus - 22 million worldwide, and 5 million in Europe. More than a third of its subscribers are now outside the U.S., and business grew 23 percent in North America and 53 percent in Europe.Based on expected 2012 earnings per share of $1.70, Travelzoo does trade with a high forward P/E of around 50. But if you're in the market for a stock that's now trading 15 percent below its recent high, and has the potential to make higher highs, Travelzoo might be one worth considering.Disclosure: None"
264863,21016,2011-04-21T15:47:04-04:00,,"I have not talked about this name on the website, but Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) is an old momo stock which has come back to life; I have been watching the past four or five months in a bit of awe. This is another example of where valuation simply does not matter (until one day it does), and trying to figure out a top based on traditional metrics has created immense pain for the ""smart money.""TZOO is one of the most heavily-shorted stocks in the market, and for obvious reasons: In mid-March it traded at 40x-ish forward estimates on 2011. That was when it was $45 ... after tripling from $15 at the time Bernanke promised us QE2 in late August. Over-extended after a 200% run? Not so fast.[Click to enlarge]With today's 24%+ gain, the stock has doubled yet again in just over a month, from $45 to $90. From the original $15, that's a 500% gain.The catalyst today is an earnings report, in which the company posted a solid beat of 9 cents; 37 cents v 28 cents expectation. Even if we take the year-end analysts' estimate of $1.17 and say Travelzoo will make $1.40 (aggressive assumption) we are now talking a forward PE of 65. But I guess in a market where Chinese Internet stocks are trading at Price to Sales of 150, everything else is a bargain. It's the relative valuation game, 1999 style.To reiterate: No one is saying these companies are not growing ... we have simply returned to an era where no valuation is too high for a select group of about 50 companies.Full report here."
283413,24302,2011-07-31T12:54:19-04:00,,"When a highflier like Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) misses earnings, the aftermath is generally not pretty. In the two weeks prior to its earnings release, Travelzoo shares gained about 15% as investors were expecting robust earnings like the company announced in the previous quarter. When investors learned that the company not only missed the bottom line by nine cents (0.30 versus 0.39) but that even the top line was lighter than expected, Travelzoo's shares were crushed, falling 30% the next day. At $55, the shares are about 45% off of the 52 week high, but still up nearly 40% from the start of the year and more than triple the level they were at just a year ago. At current levels, shares still trade around 35x 2011E EPS and ~23x 2012E EPS. While I wouldn't go so far as to say the shares are a steal at current levels, I do feel that there is a unique opportunity to profit off of the implied volatility in Travelzoo shares. Given the massive premiums in the options, there is a great play here that could generate a 200% return on invested capital over the next nine months with considerable downside potential. Also, in my opinion, though analysts seem to be doing a good job estimating current year earnings, I think most analysts are not giving the company full credit for next year's potential. This is all the more true given the doubts arising in investors' minds following the earnings disappointment.Let's look at the disappointment first. Analysts were expecting 39 cents on $39 million of revenue. Not only did the company miss by nine cents due to higher than expected spending, but it even missed the top line by $1.4 million. The higher spending seems to not have been properly communicated by management. Apparently management believes it indicated that it would be running some TV ads as a test. Unfortunately, investors did not realize the results would be so horrible - $2 million in ad spend with no positive results! Also, given the fact that Travelzoo does not provide forward guidance, management could have done a better job in communicating that it will be investing in the Local Deals rollout. That said, I'm not sure how investors could assume that the company would build a $100 million revenue run rate business in less than a year with no investment. Its only appropriate that the company had the biggest jump in employees in its history. I think this is a positive given the traction in the Local Deals business and the fact that this new business has jumpstarted an otherwise stagnating company. Lastly, given the nine cent beat last quarter, it is possible that some of Travelzoo's customers may have spent more of their vacation dollars in the previous quarter which adversely affected Q2. In any case, I believe Travelzoo's long-term growth prospects remain intact, and management has done a better job communicating their growth strategy on the latest earnings call.Following the company's Q1 earnings announcement, analysts significantly increased their expectations for this year and especially next year given the rapid traction in the Local Deals business. Similar to GroupOn (NASDAQ:GRPN), Living Social and others, Travelzoo began its Local Deals offering about a year ago. With over 20 million affluent travel-savvy consumers who have opted to receive Travelzoo's exclusive, curated travel deals newsletter each week, TravelZoo was ideally positioned to provide such a service. In just a year, the company has expanded the Local Deals offering to 75 markets in six countries. In the latest quarter, it added 27 new markets, up from 18 in each of the previous quarters. Most of the increase in headcount (up from 296 to 343 in the latest quarter) was related to the expanding Local Deals business. Management indicated it is currently generating about $33,000 in gross revenue on an average deal, which has remained constant in recent quarters. Established markets are generating higher revenue per deal; however, given the pace of expansion, new markets are holding the average down. If Travelzoo is in 100 markets next year (it should be in 100 markets within a few months) and continues to generate $33,000 per deal (it should generate more next year) and it offers 2 such deals per week, the company could generate over $340 million in gross revenue. Management previously indicated that it receives 30-40% of gross revenue, which is in line with the nascent markets norm of 30-50%. Assuming that competition limits the company to 30% of gross revenue, Travelzoo should still generate over $100 million in additional revenue from the Local Deals business. Based on reported gross revenue of $26 million in Q2, the company is already doing over $100 million in annualized gross revenue ($30-35 million net based on 30-35% take). Travelzoo's core business is expected to grow at a page of 15-20% per year next year, similar to this year. That suggests the core business should generate about $130 million this year and possibly $150 million next year. Add to that the local business and you get about $162 million for this year and possibly $250 million next year. Analysts are estimating on average $162 million for this year but only $210 for next year. Based on this analysis, I believe analysts' estimates properly take into account the trajectory of new revenue opportunities for this year, but significantly underestimate next year's potential. Even if the company is unable to expand margins despite a much larger business, based on 25% margins and a 37% tax rate, Travelzoo could generate EPS of $2.43 next year. A 200bps increase in margin would equate to EPS of over $2.60. 22x forward earnings is a pretty reasonable multiple for a company that is growing 40-50%.In my opinion, the ideal way to play this stock is by selling puts. There is so much implied volatility in Travelzoo's shares, that the premiums one could earn for selling deeply out of the money puts is about as impressive as I've seen in a while. One could sell December $40 or $45 puts and earn a 15-20% return, respectively, without risking a single dollar of losses unless the stock declines a further 35-40%. Most options investors have margin accounts, which results in a 200% return in less than 9 months since selling such far out of the money options generally only requires an investor to hold 10% of the strike price as collateral plus the options proceeds. If you want to be even safer, and especially if you are unsure whether the company can exceed expectations in the near-term, you could protect yourself by buying September $40 or $45 puts for just $1-1.50.Disclosure: I am long TZOO."
117331,22064,2009-01-29T09:49:09-05:00,,"Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) is scheduled to report fourth quarter 2008 results after the market closes on Tuesday, February 3. Based on our analysis, we at EarningsPreview.com are expecting TZOO to report disappointing results that fail to meet Wall Street’s expectations.Analyst ExpectationsWe are forecasting revenues of $16.7 million and EPS of ($.14). This would represent a 13% decline in revenues from last year’s $19.1 million in the same period. The current analyst consensus calls for revenues of $17.5 million and ($.12) EPS.Travelzoo has failed to meet Wall Street’s estimates for the past few quarters and we see little likelihood for that to change now. The company blamed poor Q3 results on weakening economy and the economic headwinds have gotten much stronger in the fourth quarter.The company’s aggressive expansion strategy into Europe and Asia Pacific has yielded little results so far and has been significant drain on resources. Based on the company’s current cash burn rate, Travelzoo could even run out of cash by the end of the year.  However, we don’t think that scenario is very likely. Management has announced their intentions to reduce costs and slow their spending in Asia Pacific and Europe. We have recommended reducing their international spending for some time as meaningful results don’t seem likely in the near or even medium term. Travelzoo has an incredibly simple business model with the potential to yield high margins. It needs to spend 2009 rediscovering that business model.Share PerformanceTravelzoo's shares are down 23% since the beginning of the year. Last year, Travelzoo’s shares fell over 59%, well eclipsing the Nasdaq’s 41% drop.ValuationShares are now trading at 0.8x consensus 2009 revenue estimates. The stock has been in free fall since mid-December and will likely continue falling after the earnings announcement. However, we believe there will be support below $4 per share and would recommend the shares if the price falls much below that point.Recommendation: Hold with a $4 price target.Stock position: None."
133842,22566,2009-04-29T02:03:28-04:00,,"Internet media company Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) impressed with its 1Q09 results, primarily because it managed to stabilize the U.S. business amid a continuing downturn in the travel industry. This should not have come as a surprise to those familiar with the company, however, as Travelzoo's Top 20 weekly newsletter represents a preferred capacity liquidation vehicle for many travel providers. When travel companies are forced to sell their inventory on the cheap, they turn to Travelzoo. (Travel companies can't ""force"" Travelzoo to include them in the newsletter, but they can make their deals so compelling that Travelzoo chooses to include them. Of course, Travelzoo gets paid for each deal it includes in the Top 20.)Also of note was the fact that Travelzoo grew 1Q09 European revenue by roughly 50% y-y while cutting the European operating loss by roughly in half. With both revenue and profit moving in the right direction, it appears Europe is on the cusp of becoming a contributor to profit rather than a drain on it.We analyzed Travelzoo in the November 2008 issue of Portfolio Manager's Review and pointed out a number of this we liked about the company:We presented a synopsis of our Travelzoo analysis in a Seeking Alpha article in December 2008.Disclosure: No position."

We think the move was unwarranted and that the shares could double from here.We have long thought of TZOO as a public way to play the burgeoning growth of local deals, led by private companies Groupon and LivingSocial, but part of a group of about 400 companies that are now offering local deals of some sort.The Groupon/Expedia announcement of a discount travel product named Groupon Getaways with Expedia will focus initially on hotels and will allow each company to tap into each other’s customers databases.We believe that this market can sustain multiple participants and the fact that Expedia has chosen to go this route supports TZOO’s strategy. LivingSocial is already in this market generating near $100 million in travel sales and has had zero impact on TZOO’s business.TZOO has been offering Local Deals since 2010, and is now in 48 markets. Local Deals reported $16 million in gross sales for TZOO in 1Q11, and $ 6 million in net sales.  Local Deals accelerated TZOO’s growth rate and margin expansion and supported EPS growth near 40% in 2011, accelerating to 44% in 2012, according to consensus.  The shares are insanely cheap based on growth expectations. Consensus expects TZOO to generate $2.34 in EPS in 2012, a number we think is conservative, for a PE of 30x, and a PEG of .75x, based on 40% EPS growth over two years. We think a PEG of 1.5x is more appropriate for a company like TZOO, meaning that the shares should be trading at $140, up 100%.In addition, we think the company could be ready to sell and we think a logical acquirer could be Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) or possibly Facebook, with are looking to quickly ramp their travel offerings and local deals in particular.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

This would represent an 8% increase in revenues from last year’s $20.1M in the same period.We expect that the downturn in the U.S. economy was actually a positive for Travelzoo’s business. High gas prices led vacationers to look more diligently for vacation bargains. This appears to have resulted in increased traffic levels to the site and a jump in subscription levels for the popular Top 20 email newsletter. Share PerformanceTravelzoo’s shares have dropped a whopping 40% this year. That compares poorly to the much more modest drop of only 13% for the NASDAQ. Unfortunately for Travelzoo, they were the victim of their own success as they traded at a very high valuation for most of last year. The drop in overall valuations as well as the markets realization that expansion into Europe and Asia-Pacific was going to have a serious effect on their short-term profitability has resulted in the big sell-off this year.ValuationShares are now trading at 27x consensus 2009 EPS estimates. This represents a slight premium to their peer group.

26327,20454,2007-02-07T10:11:20-05:00,,"While I don't usually like to highlight rating changes, I think these two are meaningful: - First Albany is upgrading their rating on Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) to Strong Buy from Underperform as the basis of their Underperform rating - a 4Q:FY06 earnings miss - has passed. Now, they see a combustible mix of likely 1Q:FY07 upside, compelling valuation, and high short interest in Travelzoo shares. Firm also thinks the significant insider selling that pressured shares through 2006 is done. Yesterday Travelzoo reported 4Q revenue and EPS of $17.7 million and $0.26 (see conference call transcript) versus firm's expectation of $17.9 million and $0.27 and the Street consensus expectation of $18.3 million and $0.28, respectively. Firm sees upside to the 1Q:FY07 Street consensus and to their Street-high expectations. They believe the 1Q:FY07 Street consensus, as it stood before yesterday's results ($20.5 million in revenue and $0.32 in EPS) inadequately accounted for the easy comparison Travelzoo will enjoy now that results will no longer ""comp"" the 2005 departure of 10% customer Travelocity. In fact they view their revenue and EPS estimates of $20.8 million and $0.33, respectively, to be conservative. High short interest could be rocket fuel. With more than 11 days' of trading volume in Travelzoo shares sold short, the upside the firm sees to 1Q:FY07 estimates could drive significant share price increases. CEO Ralph Bartel was an active seller of Travelzoo shares in 2006. However, with his ownership now hovering a tad above 50%, we think his selling is mostly done. Tgt goes to $38 from $26. - Stifel notes that despite a weak quarter, they are upgrading their rating on TZOO shares to Hold. Based on after hours pricing of $29.80, the shares trade for 20.4x 2008 earnings. They remain cautious on TZOO but no longer believe the shares justify a Sell rating. The company gives no information about its business to allow an investor to make a rational investment decision. That said, TZOO trades for 20.4x 2008 estimates based on after hours pricing of $29.80. TZOO is a high margin business in an industry with respectable long-term rates of growth. Given that after hours pricing suggests shares are within 6% of their $28 fair value estimate, they are adjusting their rating to Hold. Firm remain cautious on the company due to management share distribution, limited information, and slowing trends in the North America business. They would be buyers of the stock in the low-$20s, all else equal. Notablecalls: The stock is a notorious short killer. Short interest stands at 30%+, so I would expect an explosive move upward from levels reached in after mkt. First Albany may have created something big here. Actionable call. Sitting at my old trading desk I would buy every stock below $32 level and then take the price up by another 1.5-2 pts. Actionable!"

37759,20725,2007-06-08T04:58:11-04:00,,"Travelzoo (NASDAQ:TZOO) is an internet company that provides travel companies with a place to advertise their deals and consumers with a great tool to search for travel deals. Its product provides consumers a free search to look for travel offers.     Some of its big advertisers are companies such as airlines, hotels, cruise lines, vacation packagers and other travel companies. Its products include the Travelzoo website, the Travelzoo Top 20 e-mail newsletter, SuperSearch and its Newsflash e-mail product. Its operations are based in North America and Europe. Its founder, Ralph Bartel, is still with the company and owns 50.2% of the outstanding shares. The recent stock downfall was due to a 1st quarter that did not reach analyst expectations. Analysts expected $0.32 per share but it earned only $0.25 per share. It was still an increase compared to the same time period last year, but that was only because of the smaller number of shares outstanding; net income went down. The increased expenses can mostly be attributed to a rise in sales and marketing expenses and an increase in the income tax rate. Its Canadian and European operations, which were just recently launched, are still experiencing losses. It's also currently experiencing downward price pressure on the stock due to its program to make cash payments to people who failed to convert their shares of Travelzoo.com Corporation to Travelzoo Inc., due to the mergers of different Travelzoo companies. There is no estimate of how much this program will cost the company. Industry This is a booming industry, travel companies are involved in a lot of advertising and the internet offers them significant medium advantages over newspapers. First, the company can update their ads real-time, unlike in newspapers where you have to wait until their customer service opens and a delay to update the ad. Second, these ads are more effective, targeting people who are looking for travel deals. Third, these are cheaper than placing ads in the newspaper and the travel deals are being sold directly, not through a 3rd party such as a travel agent. The internet offers travel companies much more flexibility than a newspaper does. Travelzoo will continue to benefit in the shift to internet advertising. Travelzoo faces competition from big competitors such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Yahoo! (YHOO) and other internet websites that offer a travel search similar to Travelzoo’s. This industry is part of the internet mega trend. A downturn in the economy will hurt its performance due to the sensitivity of the travel market to the economy. Also, terrorist attacks might severely hurt Travelzoo’s operation due to fear, similar to the effects of the horrific events of 9/11. Company 95% of its revenue comes from the United States. It recently had a slip in revenue per employee due to new growth expansion. It currently has 94 employees. Technology is very important for Travelzoo, it will have to continue to innovate to compete with different internet travel websites. Brand awareness is essential for success in the internet travel industry. The amount of new subscribers to its two email services has been steadily going down. Its total subscribers has been increasing but the number of new subscribers has been increasing at a decreasing rate. Its goal is to continue expanding into other geographical locations and expand its reach. Its executives are relatively low paid compared to the outrageous salaries executives are earning now. Valuation TZOO is currently trading at a trailing P/E ratio of 25.12 and a forward p/e ratio for fiscal year 2008 of 18.75. Its full year 2007 and 2008 earnings have both been revised down recently. Its balance sheet is strong, it has almost $40 million of cash and cash equivalents and no debt. Insiders own almost 57% of the shares outstanding. Its share count has been shrinking with recent buybacks. It bought back 1,000,000 shares in 2006 and just authorized an additional 1 million share buy back. Its free cash flow is strong. Revenues have been growing at an exceptional level, even in a bad quarter like last quarter, revenues grew 17% year-over-year. TZOO was in the top 25 Magic Formula stocks with a market cap of over $100m as of 6/6/2007. Technicals Currently TZOO is trading at below its three major moving averages. The 50DMA just crossed below the 200DMA, not a good sign for things to come. The big recent drop on higher volume does not bode well for short-term momentum. It is currently right around very solid support of $25 a share. The $25 level has acted as support for over a year. TZOO has traded between $25 and $40 a share for the past year. RSI is giving an oversold signal with a slight bullish divergence. MACD is showing slight bullish momentum. Conclusion Travelzoo will continue to benefit from industry trends such as the continuous shift of advertising from newspapers to the internet and the wider use of the internet. This slipup in the first quarter was not major, it's continuing to spend on growth and short-term earnings will suffer because of that. Growth always involves an initial investment which will create downwards pressure on earnings. I would be more concerned if Travelzoo was not making new investments. If these sales & marketing investments were capitalized, similar to new equipment investments of a manufacturer, this would alleviate the pressure on earnings. Revenue is still growing at a brisk pace. Disclosure: I don’t have a position in TZOO."

The results slightly missed our and market expectations; however, with no major surprises.Following the results, the stock plummeted - 5.4% while subsequently closing at -3.8% and in line with the major indices (NASDAQ -3.6%; NYSE - 3.1%) as the market was suffering from increasing pressures of COVID-19. Given the similar magnitude of the stock and the market decline, we believe it's fair to assume a muted stock reaction explained by the release of financial figures.Overall, in the conference call, the management sounded rather conservative pointing out that 2019 was an abnormal strong year for Unisys with 2020 being softer. Sales growth should be rather flattish (midpoint) which is in line with our expectations and beating the market consensus, which expected a -4% decline. The management expects a mild margin decline, we reckon explained by the sale of the US business, which operates at above group-average margin levels, while core business (""Enterprise"") margins should stay roughly flat.As mentioned in our last article, we see 2020 as a transition year and working toward increasing backlog levels, which saw a considerable decline in 2019 to $4.3b (-10% y/y). Overall, we continue to see Unisys as an attractive buying opportunity backed by new customer wins, improving operating metrics and solid growth prospects, as the sale of US Fed business frees up financial resources.In the conference call, the management explicitly mentioned no material impact from COVID -19 outbreak with revenue share in China accounting for less than 5% and no expansion expected.The company will host Investors Day on April 29, where it presents a new strategy, financial performance and financial implications of US Fed business sale.Chart 1: Sharp stock increase following the sale announcementData by YChartsMissing our expectations, Unisys saw its Q4 sales declining by -2% (non-GAAP) as growth in the Services segment wasn't as pronounced, +1.9%, as expected +5.2%. On par with our expectations, the Technology segment was the main growth spoiler, posting a sharp decline of -19.9% (non-GAAP) and slightly ahead of our -21.9% estimate.Overall, 2019 was an extraordinarily strong year for Unisys with 6.1% (non-GAAP) sales growth backed by strong +26.5% growth in the US Fed business and Public sector +7.3%, while other segments (e.g., commercial and financials) were rather sluggish.For 2020, the management guides for -2% to +2% growth (excl. US Fed business) with flat growth at the mid-point. This is in line with our expectations, as we believe the company's main focus in 2020 is growing order backlog in its core Enterprise segment and participating in larger deals, with the newly unleashed financial freedom, following US Fed business sale.In the conference call, the management highlighted softer growth dynamics in H1'20 given tough comparables and renewals schedule in the Technology portfolio tilted towards the end of the year.Chart 2 Steeper Q4 growth decline amid softer Service salesSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysSales miss in the Service segment Sales growth of +1.9% wasn't as pronounced as originally expected +5.2%, explained by the mild decline in Application Services, -2.8%, and Business Process Outsourcing surprising us with a very steep decline of -10% vs. expected +8%. On the positive side, Cloud and Infrastructure solutions, which account for more than 60% of the segment's revenue, surprised us with +15% growth vs. expected +6.3%.Overall, 2019 was a strong year for Service business with +6.7% growth - way ahead of last year's +2.8%, as Unisys was working through its large order backlog, in particular in the US Fed segment.The company didn't provide any sales guidance on a segment basis. However, in the conference call, we have learned that JV (check usage business with iPSL; 51% share), which accounted for c. 6% or $145m in 2019 of the segment's revenue, is expected to decline to $105m in 2020 (with continued modest declines during contract duration until 2023) and burdening the overall revenue growth. However, we believe continued solid growth in InteliServe and CloudForte products will offset the negative JV impact with flat pro-forma revenue growth in 2020. Overall, we see the management's main focus on building up the order backlog, which saw a considerable decline to $4.3b or -10% y/y (incl. US Fed business) at the end of 2019. Including $200m in two delayed large projects, which the company closed in Q1'20, order backlog would be at $4.5b and in line with its expectations.Chart 3 Cloud & Infrastructure saves the growth in Q4; however, not enough to offset the decline in other productsSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysTechnology is slightly better; however, still in rapid decline amid tough comparablesQ4 sales dynamics were weak as expected with sales declining sharply by -19.9% vs. expected -21.9%. This steep sales drop was largely anticipated by us and the market, given that 2018 revenue was back-end loaded whereas 2019 was spread over the course of the year. This slightly better sales figure, translated into +2.7% overall growth for the full year vs. expected 2%.Amid light renewal schedule of ClearPath Forward business and being partially offset by continued strong Stealth growth, albeit still low sales contribution, the management expects ""technology revenue to be down high-single-digit percentage year-over-year"" while subsequently rebounding in 2021 with a large license renewal schedule which will more than offset the robust 2020 sales decline. We adjust our estimates accordingly to reflect the expected growth dynamics. Overall, we expect to see +3.6% over the cycle growth driven by cross-selling activities with the Service segment as well as new products attracting new customers and renewals, which are highly predictable by the management.Chart 4 Q4 was competing with strong comparablesSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysProfitability development in Q4 was disappointing for us with non-GAAP operating margin residing at 8.6% - below our and market estimates of 9.5% and 9.35%, respectively. The management mentioned unfavorable product mix in the Technology segment, with a higher share of third-party hardware sales. For the full year, the disparity between actual and expected margin wasn't as steep with non-GAAP operating margin at 9% vs. expected 9.2%.As the company mentioned in its last conference call (no transcript available), convertible note exchange, restructuring costs, and fx impact, among others resulted in a negative (basic) EPS of -$0.31 vs. $1.48 last year, which we reckon were not included in the consensus figures.The group's newly published guidance reads a non-GAAP operating margin of between 7.7% and 8.7% with a mid-point at 8.2% indicating a decline of 80bps compared to last year. However, the guidance excludes US Fed business profitability, and management didn't provide any insight into margins of its core Enterprise business to track the performance. Based on the known information, that US Fed business was already operating at its maximum margin levels and 2020 EV/EBITDA (adj.) valuation multiple of 10.5x, which SAIC paid, we calculate the margin of the US Fed business should be roughly between 11% and 13% and ahead of the group's average margin of 9%. This, in turn, suggests, that the 2020 Enterprise margin is flattish. In the conference call, the management mentioned an expected margin boost of between 75bps and 100bps in 2021, following the savings realization of c. $60m from the sale of US Fed business implying reverting to its pre-sale margin levels of up to 9.7%.Overall, 2019 was the strongest year for Unisys, mainly driven by double-digit growth in the US Fed business and public sectors. Margin decline was anticipated and explained by unfavorable product mix in the Technology segment as well as transition costs. 2020 should be a transition year with the main focus in H1'20 the finalization of US Fed business sale; debt repayment, further investments in more efficient cost structures (i.e., automation, exit from low profitability countries) and service backlog expansion. In 2021, we expect to see solid high single-digit growth and moderate margin improvement with a subsequent multiples expansion (2020 EV/Sales 0.31; EV/EBIT 2.7x). We see H1'20 providing good buying opportunities."
4325274,105399,2020-02-19T13:02:15-05:00,"Unisys' stock price rocketed almost 50% after the company announced the sale of its US Fed business and confirmed a strong finish to the year.2020 guidance and backlog development are key determinants of stock volatility.We still see sizable upside potential in the long term with 2020 being a ""transition year"", in light of the US Fed business sale.","Unisys (UIS) is scheduled to release its full Q4/FY19 financial figures on February 25. We expect to see mixed Q4 results with Technology business dragging the overall performance down - largely anticipated by the market. We don't expect to see any surprises with regards to adjusted profitability; however, on reported basis, one-off expenses of c. €48m should burden the group's profitability, as highlighted in the recent conference call (no transcript available).So far, the stock performance was very strong, returning +36% YTD and almost doubling in value after the announcement of the US Fed business sale (please refer to ""Unisys: The Game-Changing Move""). We would expect to get more detailed information on the magnitude of the US Fed business sale, in particular in terms of profitability and cash flows and would pay close attention to the order backlog in the Enterprise segment (excl. US Fed) and 2020 guidance.Chart 1: Sharp stock increase following the sale announcementData by YChartsFollowing strong 9M '19 results (+12% fx adj.), Q4 should be mild with virtually no revenue growth. While we see Services revenue growing at the mid-single-digit rate (+5.2%), Technology is the one to drag the performance with a sharp growth decline of -21.9%, as a majority of contract renewals were done in 9M '19.For the full 2019, we revise our growth estimate to 6.7% on an adjusted revenue basis to align with the management's expectations. The market appears to be a bit cautious with 6% total growth, however still toward the upper end of the guidance.In the recent press release, Unisys has already alluded to the fact that adj. revenue growth will end up at the upper end of the guidance of 3% to 7%. We remind the company upgraded its guidance (two times) following a strong performance in Q3 '19.We note, 2019 is an extraordinarily strong year for Unisys backed by new deals signing, in the prior periods, in particular in 2018 which saw its backlog surging 11.6%. In the mid-term, we would expect to see growth normalizing from the high 2019 levels at 5.1% CAGR 2018-23 (non-GAAP) and slightly ahead of the group's mid-term sales growth range of 2% to 4% (should be revised in H1'20 to account for the sale of US Fed business, we reckon).We should keep a close eye on backlog dynamics in Q4 as it will guide the revenue growth in 2020. As a reminder, Q3 backlog declined sharply by -14.3% which was largely attributed to the US Fed business with -12% decline. Given that Unisys agreed to sell its US Fed business to SAIC, with an expected closure in H1 '20, we would expect to see smoother backlog development going forward.We reckon that 2020 guidance (expected to be published) will move the stock price, as the market expects -4% decline, presumably on falling backlog figures. This is generally in line with our view; however, we expect flat revenue as Unisys is about to enter its downward cycle. Once again, the overall business dynamics might change given the aforementioned sale.Chart 2 Q4 should bring full-year growth to the upper-endSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysSolid growth dynamics in the Service segment saves Q4We expect to see sequential growth decline, with Q4 at +5.2% compared to +8.3% in 9M '19 which largely reflects backlog dropping -14.3% in Q3 - an indicator of the group's topline development. In terms of segments, we see Cloud Infrastructure solutions with +6.3% growth as well as business product outsourcing of +8% as key drivers of the segment's performance.The strong performance in 9M '19 combined with moderate growth in Q4 should result in a strong overall 2019 growth of +7.5% - a substantial improvement compared to last year +2.8%, which is largely attributed to Cloud products in US Fed business and commercial segment.2020 should be a transition year as we see backlog decline from its record high $4.8b level to $4.6b in 2019.Chart 3 Slight sequential decline is expectedSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysTechnology is the biggest growth spoiler in Q4Backed by strong revenue development in 9M '19 (c. +15.3% y/y) on contract renewals and only mild 2% full-year growth, Q4 sales should decline sharply by -21.9%. In the Q3 conference call, the management mentioned one large contract being pushed in Q4 '19. If Unisys failed to book the contract, the decline might be much more pronounced.We expect to see improving growth dynamics with +3.6% CAGR by 2023 backed by 1) cross-selling activities; 2) new product generation boosting customer wins; and 3) renewals for ClearPath Forward business. However, given the project-like nature of the business, the revenue profile might be rather lumpy.Chart 4 No triggers for Q4 are expectedSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysIn the recent press release, the management has alluded that non-GAAP operating margin will end up at the upper end of the guided range of 8.25% to 9.25%. This indicates Q4 adjusted margin should move to 9.5% - a decline of 240bps vs. last year of 11.9% - explained by transition costs and unfavorable product mix in the Technology segment. The market also shares the management's view and expects a 9.35% full-year margin, with no surprises expected.However, we want to highlight c. $48m of one-off expenses coming in Q4 - burdening reported margin figures. Those will be excluded on an adjusted basis.For 2020, we would expect flat margins backed by declining sales volume (boosting the profitability); however, the sale of US Fed business (H2 '20 onwards), which operates on the highest profit margin, offsets the positive impact. Contrary to our expectations, the market remains cautious and expects a 50bps margin drop, which we believe doesn't include the US Fed business sale.Chart 5 Q4 profitability drivers full-year margin toward the upper endSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysWe don't expect to see any surprises in the financial results, as the management already indicated they will finish the year at the upper end of the guidance. We would keep a close eye on backlog development and new 2020 guidance and (hopefully) more insight into the sale of US Fed business, which should be the key stock drivers on that day. In particular, cash flow and profitability impact would be very helpful to make some meaningful assumptions regarding future operating performance.Overall, we have a positive view on Unisys as the sale of the US Fed business frees up financial resources enabling the company to invest in value and margin accretive larger deals, which were impossible in the past. Despite the sharp stock increase, we still see a sizable upside potential of up to 40% based on fundamental valuation as well as (still) low valuation levels (2020 PE 26x and EV/EBIT 3.6x)."
4323518,105399,2020-02-12T13:30:05-05:00,Unisys's shares doubled after announcing the sale of its US Federal business.Valuation multiples were disproportionally high compared to Unisys's trading multiples with sizable cash proceeds.The transaction drives significant debt reduction (including pensions) and frees up resources to pursue larger deals - driving its future growth.,"After months of news drought, Unisys (UIS) tipped the scale and announced the sale of its US Federal business for $1.2b to Science Applications International Corp. (SAIC) and capitalizing on the recently strong operating performance of the business. The valuation multiples indicate significant premiums to Unisys's trading multiples in excess of 5x and 7x on adj. EBITDA and sales. With the sale proceeds, Unisys is targeting a reduction in its financial debt and immense unfunded pension liability. The stock price almost doubled in value as investors celebrated the transaction. The company didn't provide any further information regarding the profitability and free cash flows of the US Fed business. However, it has promised to share more details during the scheduled earnings release on February 25 as well as upcoming Investors Day following transaction close in H1 '20.The sale of US Fed business with c. $689m in revenue which accounts for c. 23% of total sales provides much-needed relief for its substantially underfunded pension liabilities. According to the management, the (largely tax-free) proceeds of $1.2b will be split into two parts:According to the press release, the unfunded pension liability will be reduced to $1.14b from the current $1.74b on a pro-forma basis, indicating an 80% funded status. Coupled with debt repayment and lower pensions, financial leverage should decline to 2.4x vs. 4.2x on a pro-forma basis. In addition, the management will pursue bilateral agreements with pension plan beneficiaries with the goal to further reduce or restructure its pension liabilities.In the conference call, the management has also touched upon the IRS waiver, stating that it's still pending and they are pushing to a ""favorable resolution"". Although IRS will be now less inclined to approve it, given the expected cash inflows from the transaction.We emphasize, given a much stronger balance sheet, Unisys will be able to drive its cost of capital (debt) down from extremely high levels of 10.75% (senior secured note), which was burdening the group's profitability and prohibiting it from participating in value-accretive M&A transactions.Chart 1 Game-changing transaction to UnisysSource: Unisys CorporationOne of the biggest benefits of the sale is the cash release needed for larger deals, which Unisys had to miss given high pension contributions. During the conference call (no transcript available), the management talked about the ability to invest in new products to benefit from emerging trends such as IoT and serving large IoT devices, for which they didn't have enough resources before. The management has also emphasized that they might consider M&A activity in the future, in particular benefiting from lower financing costs (as discussed above) enabling them to grow their topline inorganically as well.The company didn't provide any insight into the profitability of the US Federal business, only stating that it was already operating at or above its maximum profitability levels, presenting limited upside potential going forward. With respect to cash flows, the management hinted that the greatest cash flow generator is the ClearPath Forward solution, providing no further information. However, we understand cash flows from the US Federal business are sizable, in particular as its growth significantly accelerated in 2019 (9M'19 sales growth +28%). We reckon that the business is rather bulky and requires substantial upfront investments, which given Unisys's minimal financial resources, was dragging growth potential in other business areas.The management has also talked about the IP (intellectual property) situation following the sale. SAIC will have full access to IP which is used for US Federal business, in particular to CloudForte products - sharing ownership with Unisys with no future payment obligation. In addition, SAIC will get full access to all other products, such as Stealth, ClearPath Forward, and InteliServe in return for licensing revenues to Unisys. We believe this arrangement is highly beneficial for Unisys, as SAIC has a larger footprint in the federal market and thereby, enhancing license revenue from those technologies - win-win for both.Chart 2 Transaction provides further revenue boost going forwardSource: Unisys CorporationThe transaction presents a game-changing opportunity for Unisys to sustainably reduce its high pension liabilities and free up resources to drive its operating performance going forward. As highlighted in our first article (""Unisys Is Fuelling The Growth Engine With Unresolved Issues Still Remaining""), with the sale of US Federal business, the company addresses those unresolved issues, which put a burden on further topline growth and margin expansion. Although pension liabilities will remain a key topic of discussion in the years to follow, the prepayment of those sizable cash contributions will enable the company to invest in innovation and future growth resulting in rising free cash flows going forward."
3500606,78265,2015-09-10T23:46:36-04:00,"Shares of Unisys Corp are down massively over the past year. We thought we'd take this opportunity to explore whether or not the shares represent good value at these levels.
        They don't. The company generates a very poor level of operating profit and equity at the firm is negative, in large part because of pension obligations.
        In spite of that, the shares remain very optimistically priced. We recommend avoiding Unisys until shares fall further and/or until operations improve dramatically.","Shares of Unisys Corp (NYSE:UIS) are down about 47% over the past year and down about 54% year to date. Given that we like to bargain hunt, we thought we'd look in on the company to see if shares now represent good value. Sadly, they don't. We believe there remains a high level of optimism around the shares, which is strange to us in light of the low level of operating profit and the negative equity here. We recommend that investors continue to eschew this name until things turn around materially for Unisys. We review our logic below.Operating ProfitThe first thing we do when analyzing any business is to consider the level of operating profit the company can generate relative to the capital provided by owners and (in this case entirely) by creditor. Our reasoning is straightforward enough. If a company can't generate sufficient profit to compensate investors for the risks (both known and unknown) associated with investing in a company, there's no point in conducting the exercise. Furthermore, operating profits are the source of all investor wealth, so there's little else to think about in our view. In the case of companies like Unisys, we're looking for an operating yield that's about 8% greater than the risk free rate. Since 10 year US treasuries are currently priced to yield about 2.2% at the moment (data.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y) , that means we're looking for a level of operating profit to capital of about 10%. Unfortunately, Unisys doesn't come close to that hurdle, offering an operating yield of only ~1.73%. Additionally, it should be pointed out that this company has negative equity because of a very large post retirement liability. The capital structure is therefore fairly unstable.Source: Company filingsSomeone may (probably will) complain that this is a backward looking analysis and that investors buy a future stream of cash flows and not a past series of cash flows. That's a reasonable critique as far as it goes, but it misses the point. The point of this exercise isn't to provide a history lesson about the recent profitability of a company. The point is to see how near (or far) a given company is from an acceptable level of profitability. In particular, we require ~10% operating yield from companies like Unisys, given the risks we're aware of (and those we know we can't be aware of). In this case, we'd be looking for operating profits of ~$68 million (up from the current $11 million). Analyses like these allow us to know with a fairly high degree of certainty the extent to which operations would need to improve before we would be willing to invest (in this case, they would need to grow by about 518%). By having a benchmark and reviewing where a given company is relative to that, we quantify our investment process and apply some discipline to it.But Wait, There's More: OptimismFortunately or not (probably not), investing involves more than simply examining a company. We're required to think about the behavior of the stock that supposedly represents the fortunes of the underlying business. The trouble is that stock price movements say at least as much about the mood of the market than they do about anything relating to the company. Because stocks are the means by which we access companies, we need to think about the behaviour of the equity behind the company.When we think about the behavior of the stock, we specifically want to avoid overly optimistic assessments reflected in prices. If the market has great expectations for a company, they will bid the shares up in anticipation of great things from the company. This represents the worst possible payoff to shareholders. If management achieves the goals imposed on them by a an optimistic market, shares will likely move very little as expectations are already priced in. If, as is more likely, a combination of competition, slow economic growth, and a host of other issues conspire to dash hopeful expectations, shares will react predictably and negatively. The market may switch polarity quite quickly and go from being irrationally optimistic to irrationally pessimistic.One of the ways we judge the level of optimism surrounding an investment is to compare the current and the forward P/E multiples. If the forward multiple is too low, that's one sign to us that the market is too optimistic. At the moment, the P/E for Unisys is 81.2 and the forward P/E is about 4.1. Holding all else constant, that means that the market is forecasting a growth rate in profits in the order of ~1880%. This is what we'd call an overly optimistic forecast. This is especially irrationally optimistic in light of the fact that net income has been mostly flat for 20 years, with the occasional massive drop.Source: GurufocusConclusionWe believe investors would do well to avoid Unisys Corp. until the level of operating profits rises and/or until the shares fall further in price. It's difficult to believe after such a massive drop, but shares are not yet cheap (or even reasonably priced). For those reasons, we recommend that investors avoid Unisys Corp."

It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA Pro. Click here to find out more »Unisys (UIS) is a very old technology company that fell on hard times. The falling revenues and large pension obligations made Unisys unpopular with investors and then a restructuring, continuing declines in revenues and earnings, plus a dilutive convertible bond offering made investors lose hope.In the fourth quarter of 2017, however, UIS had great (if somewhat hard to decipher) results. In simplest terms, UIS had non-GAAP earnings of $1.75/share versus consensus estimates of $0.18 (according to Zacks). That is a pretty big surprise, but one needs to be suspicious of non-GAAP. In this case, however, even GAAP earnings were stellar at $0.77/share. These earnings seems like a huge surprise, yet the stock did not move accordingly. Why?Partly the answer is that earnings came out at a busy time for the market. Another part of the answer is that UIS is a complicated situation with a lot of moving parts:This complexity makes it difficult to get a quick, easy measure of what the company should be worth. So even though the stock moved up a decent amount (going from a close of $8.35 before earnings to a close of $9.85 after earnings), the stock is still undervalued as discussed below.A conservative valuation gets you to a price of at least $12.80 per share. Less conservative methods get you to closer to $20/share. The $12.80 may not be exciting by itself, but if the minimum fair price is already above the current price, there may be an opportunity to buy UIS here with plenty of cushion to ride the valuation higher.Since the stock has been declining and there are plenty of negative articles, it is useful to begin with the negatives. After that, we describe the positives and potential turn around and how one might compute a valuation.First, the company has pension obligations of about $2 billion (listed as ""Long-term postretirement liabilities"" in the Q42017 Earnings Release ) in addition to about $630 million in long term debt. These pension obligations are not good. One might even call them doubleplusungood as they are one of the primary reasons that UIS has a negative book value.As a result, movements in the market flow through to the pension obligations, along with changes in discount rate, is causing some volatility in earnings due to issues beyond the business performance. In the latest quarter, these cut in favor of UIS but this is probably not something to count on going forward.Next, revenues have been declining. Possibly, the shift to cloud computing has made some of their older technology and services less relevant. There isn't much one can say briefly regarding the revenue declines except that it is a major problem when combined with the large pension obligations.These are both reasons the company probably deserves lower valuation multiples and has had falling stock prices.The main positive is that the 2017 Q4 report shows some interesting signs of a turn around. The blow-out earnings are one example of this. Before going further, it's useful to look at the reconciliation of the GAAP vs. non-GAAP 2017 Q4 earnings as shown in the table below. Basically, UIS argues that the cost reduction (i.e., the restructuring) is a one-time event and should be excluded (which is plausible) and that the pension expense should be excluded (doubtful since there pension liability is a problem and this may recur).Digging a little deeper shows that the service revenues are roughly the same as a year ago but the technology revenues grew from $125.2 million in 2016 Q4 to $154 MM in 2017 Q4.In the 2017 Q4 conference call, the company states:These are pretty impressive growth rates for a product.You can read more about Stealth on the company's web site, although that requires you to wade through a good amount of marketing speak. From what I can make out, Stealth is a security product, which is like a collection of miniature virtual firewalls sprinkled throughout a company's network. Roughly speaking, UIS's Stealth product makes it so that the marketing department computers can't even see the accounting department computers, which can't even see the client facing computers, and so on.The benefit of this approach is that it allows companies to make their networks more robust to hacking, viruses, or other problems. I am not an expert on security, but given my experience with technology this seems like a useful and valuable idea. Given the large and growing number of computer security issues, it makes sense that companies would pay for such features as illustrated by the growth numbers above.There are a number of other positives, but in the interest of brevity I will just cite another quote from the conference call.It would be nice if the company would break this out more transparently, but overall my take-away is that it looks like UIS is beginning to turn the corner and get traction on some of its technology products. The main portion of their business is services, so on the overall revenue numbers we don't see anything great. But if you consider the technology component, these growth numbers are exciting.One area to be cautious is that a decent part of the beat was from one-time tax benefits. Probably one should not imagine those will repeat and so not give UIS full credit for sustaining these earnings. On the other hand, reconciliation section of the 2017 Q4 earnings release, UIS lists $49.4 million of ""Cost reduction and other expense"" (basically restructuring). To the extent that you believe these are not going to recur, they somewhat balance out the tax benefit.Valuing this company is difficult due to the huge pension obligation and the unexciting services business, which masks the growth of the technology business.From a forward earnings perspective, you have a multiple in the high 5's according to various sources. In the earnings call slides, UIS guides for revenue 2018 of at least $2.75 Billion and a non-GAAP operating profit margin of 7.75% - 8.75% (GAAP operating margin is guided higher at 9.5% - 10.5%). The low end of these numbers gets you to $213 MM of operating income, which gives you plenty of room for interest and other expenses. Honestly, if they can achieve those revenues and margins, the net income seems like it could be more significant than implied by the forward price/earnings from various sources.This bears further analysis to nail down the details of the earnings, but given the huge pension obligations it isn't clear that earnings is the right measure. Also, if you do think that earnings is the right measure then a forward P/E below 6 probably means that UIS is a buy here. Finally, earnings have been negative for a while so if you compare 2017 Q4 earnings to … basically any recent period in the past to ask ""what should the current price of UIS be?"" the answer is basically just ""a lot more.""As a comparison, ACN trades at a forward P/E of more than 20. It is much larger (with arguably less room for growth but with more stability and no major pension issues). Similarly, IBM trades at a forward P/E near 11 (and arguably does face some challenges). There are many other technology and consulting companies to compare to, but despite its business challenges, UIS is still one of the well known, trusted names (e.g., which is why it has contracts with organizations such as the European Central Bank, the US Governmnt, etc.). In any case, applying a P/E of say 10 to the current forward earnings suggests a share price close to 15.Given that, let's consider cash flow instead of earnings. The reason cash flow may be a useful measure here beyond the usual attractions of cash flow vs. earnings is that cash flow may account more accurately for the ongoing pension contributions, which UIS is on the hook for. For example, if you look at the company's 2017 Q4 XLS workbook, you find that they printed pension contributions of $138.4 million but pension expenses of $92.4 million. This is probably reasonable since the pension is underfunded and so the cash contributions may be higher than the expenses.In the 2017 Q4 earnings release, UIS lists free cash flow as $154.7 for Q4. It would be great if UIS provided a breakdown of how they compute cash flow for Q4, but they only provide the breakdown for the full year of 2017. In the full year calculation, the main non-cash items they add back include depreciation, amortization, and pension expenses (i.e., the expenses they incur as opposed to the pension contributions they make), which I would imagine are also the main issues in Q4.They also adjust the Q4 cash flow up to about $200 MM of ""adjusted free cash flow,"" but adjusting in that manner doesn't seem so relevant if you believe the whole point of free cash flow is to get closer to the truth than earnings. In any case, the 2017 Q4 free cash flow is roughly double the $74.9 million, which UIS printed in 2016 Q4 when the stock was around $12/share. It's also a lot more than the $7 million in FCF from the 2017 Q3 release.Probably the simplest approach is just to consider the free cash flow yield as that accounts for the pension contributions. In the 2017Q4 release, they printed $154.7 MM versus half that a year ago and about $7 MM one quarter ago in 2017Q3. This is a huge change.Obviously you could argue this is a one-timer and not sustainable. So maybe you don't give them credit for the full amount (although it does seem like there are some good things going on in the business). If you imagine that of the increase of $154.7 - $74.9 = $79.8 million relative to 2016 Q4, only half of that is sustainable, then you have in increase of (79.8/2 + 74.9)/74.9 - 1 = 153%!Applying this 153% increase to either the closing price $8.35 before earnings gets you to a fair value of $12.80/share. If you applied the 153% to the roughly $12/share in 2016 Q4, you would get to a fair value of $18.40. If you added any kind of growth assumptions (e.g., increased revenue, improved margin, or reduced restructuring charges), you would get an even higher value approaching $20/share.Instead of simply looking at the change, one could look at an absolute valuation by assigning a free cash flow multiple to the ""sustainable"" FCF of (79.8/2 + 74.9) = $114.8 million. Choosing the right multiple of FCF is something each investor should probably do themselves. Just as a point of reference, however, using a multiple of 8 for Price/FCF implies a price of at least $20/share.Based on the above arguments, it's hard to conclude that a price much below $12.80 is reasonable based on the latest data release. Note that I'm not arguing you should buy UIS hoping it gets to $12.80. If you're going to buy it, you should do so because you think the valuation is at least in the high teens. But if a conservative estimate gets you to $12.80, it suggests you can invest for the high teens target with a reasonable margin of safety from here.Unisys is a well-known technology company, which has suffered declining revenues, restructuring costs, and other difficulties. The latest quarter showed some impressive numbers and could suggest a turnaround. A fairly conservative valuation approach suggests a fair price of at least $12.80 while less conservative methods could get you to near $20/share.As another point of reference, if you consider the adjusted earnings of $1.75 and subtract the $0.18 consensus estimate from Zacks, you get $1.57. So just applying the amount of the adjusted beat to the closing price before earnings, gets you to $10/share.Based on the above, it seems like UIS is currently an attractive stock to buy."

It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA Premium. Click here to find out more »Unysis (UIS) presents a unique opportunity for rapid share price appreciation once a stimulus bill is passed. UIS share price action suggest this has been completely overlooked by the market. The current HEROES Act that was passed twice by the House includes single employer pension relief. This relief has support from both parties, does not cost the government anything and will actually generate tax revenue, which makes me believe it will be included in whatever stimulus bill is finally passed. We detail how below, but if this pension relief is passed, I estimate nearly $700 million in cash flow savings and a net reduction of the underfunded pension liability of over $1 billion. If this reduction is directly reflected in the equity value (which it should be), shares of UIS should appreciate by over $14 per share on this alone.UIS’ business has underperformed compared to its peers over the past ten years and the stock has dramatically underperformed. The stock performance has been driven by the weak business trends, but the underperformance has been exacerbated by the underfunded pension liability that is high versus the market cap and enterprise value. The company made significant strides improving business performance during 2018 and 2019, turning in two consecutive revenue growth years while operating margins expanded significantly. The pension overhang, however, remained an anchor for the shares. In February of this year UIS announced a transformational deal with SAIC, selling its government business for $1.2 billion which equated to 13x trailing revenue. This transaction immediately made the underfunded pension liability manageable and gave shareholders light at the end of what has been a very long tunnel. The shares immediately rose to over $18.00 before falling sharply with the overall market in March. Shares have since been hovering in the $10.50-12.00 range. There are several reasons for this, all of which I believe will be resolved over the next 3-6 months:1) The business has been negatively impacted by COVID and the outlook went from flat in 2020 to down 10%. The optimistic view here is that Q2 ’20 was the low point and business will improve from there, which is somewhat confirmed by the company’s stealthy positive preannouncement on Tuesday.2) Revenue growth screens much worse than down 10% YoY due to the sale of the government business. The YoY comparisons will obviously improve dramatically in Q1 ‘21 due to lapping the sale of the business and even more so in Q2 ’21 as the company begins to lap the COVID impact.3) The pension deficit overhang creates some uncertainty in the near term. This may be resolved very quickly with legislative action. In the absence of legislative action, I think this will be largely resolved by Q1 ’21 through debt issuance to fund future obligations.Treating the UIS pension deficit as debt, the company currently has $653 million of net debt vs estimate EBITDA of $270 million this year and $330 million next year equating to net debt to EBITDA of 2.4x and 1.9x. This is a very manageable leverage ratio. Layering in the equity, the company currently trades at a total EV/EBITDA of 5.6x expected 2020 EBITDA and 4.3x estimated 2021 EBITDA.In the HEROES Act, which has currently passed the House twice, is “permanent pension relief.” The text of the bill can be found here:Text - H.R.6800 - 116th Congress (2019-2020): The Heroes ActDivision-D contains the pension relief language. I think it is important to note that both political parties support this. It does not cost the government a dime, and it is actually a tax receipt generator as pension contributions are tax deductible. All this to say, whether stimulus happens before or after the election I think it is highly likely this pension relief is included.The most important aspects to UIS (and others with underfunded pensions) is changing contribution amortization to 15 years from 7 years, and adding a floor to the interest rate used to calculation the earned and accrued benefits. These changes are specifically in the Single Employer Plan portion of the bill.Below are the relevant passages from the bill. First is the interest rate (I also refer to it as the discount rate) and the second is moving the contribution amortization from 7 years to 15 years.UIS has been clear on the impact of the change in contribution amortization to the company. It would eliminate all contributions until 2026 and the contributions, once they start, would be only 20% of what is expected now. From a cashflow perspective this would be a huge positive for the company. Right now, the company expects to contribute an additional $285 million by the end of this year, $192 million in 2023 and $218 million in 2024 for a total of $695 million. I believe stabilizing the discount rate with a floor would dramatically lower the pension liability, and when paired with the likely investment gains this year, I estimate the unfunded liability would shrink from $1.75 billion to as little as $315 million. This reduction should be added to the market cap of the company for the enterprise value to remain the same. Below is a table that shows the assets and liabilities of the pension in 2018 and 2019. Liability calculations use a discount rate that is tied to current interest rates. Don’t ask me why, but they do. Interest rates declined in 2019 and the discount rate declined from 4.5% to 3.53%. This caused the pension liability to rise from $7.4 billion to $7.9 billion. With the discount rate stabilization, I expect the liability to shrink by $750 million using a 5% discount rate. I’m basing this purely on the fact that the discount rate declined by 97 basis points from 2018 to 2019 and the liability grew $500 million. I am assuming as similar reversal if the discount rate climbs 147 basis points. I realize pension accounting is highly complex, so these assumptions may be far too simplistic.On the assets side the equation from 2018 to 2019 assets grew from $5.7 billion to $6.2 billion. I would expect at least a 6% return in 2020 causing assets to grow to $6.6 billion. The company made a $315 million contribution in Q1 of this year which should push assets to $6.9 billion. Using these assumptions, the unfunded pension liability would shrink to $315 million or shrink by $1.4 billion. This would put the company in a significant net cash position if you treat the underfunded liability as debt. Again, I realize I’m making simplistic assumptions and pension accounting is complex, but even hair-cutting that to a net reduction of $1 billion for the purpose of the equity still equates to $13.33 per share, assuming 75 million shares. See the table below to help sort this out.When thinking about the appropriate share price target for UIS I think 8x EV/EBITDA is a reasonable number compared to comps trading north of 10x and Accenture (ACN) trading at 16x. I expect the shares to climb toward this multiple over the next three to six months as we approach positive year over year comps and the company also realizes the full impact of the elimination of the $50 million of leftover government business costs. This brings me to my EBITDA estimate for 2021 of $350 million. The management guidance for 2020 implies roughly $270 million. I assume that with a full year of the $50 million of cost savings and not having the negative COVID impact, $350 million is a reasonable target for 2021. It’s also in line with at least one sell side analyst’s estimate. Using this estimate, below is a table showing my target price with and without pension relief. I think this is a great risk/reward ratio regardless of pension relief. I will note that I’m not giving any consideration to the company’s $1.6 billion deferred tax asset. This write-up is complicated enough, and I think the idea that the stock is cheap with significant catalysts on the near horizon is clear.Lastly a nod to Peter Altabef. Peter has a history of turning around and selling businesses for great multiples. Peter sold Perot Systems to Dell in 2009 and Micros Systems to Oracle in 2014. I think the sale of the UIS government business was the first step in a two-step process."

To date, both products have failed to generate any substantial revenue.The announcement that Coleman will be stepping down is probably a sign that the board has lost confidence in Stealth and Forward!. The implications for Unisys’s growth prospects are dismal.","On October 6, 2014, Unisys (NYSE:UIS) announced its current CEO, J. Edward Coleman, will be leaving his post effective December 2014. The announcement has critical and probably negative implications for the value of an already struggling firm. The announcement was followed by a decline in share price by more than 10%.The growth and value of Unisys hinges on the success of its two new products, Stealth and Forward!. Ousting the CEO, citing a need to focus on its ""growth agenda"", paints a negative picture for the potential of these products.BackgroundUnisys is a global IT company that focuses its efforts on providing technology and services for mission critical tasks. The firm has been characterized by lackluster revenue performance over the past several years. Spotting an inflection in the growth trajectory of Unisys could potentially prove to be a very rewarding exercise.Unisys is cheap. Currently, it is trading at a market cap of $1.17 billion with a negative net debt position of $364 million ($574 Mn cash, $210 Mn total debt). With a 5-year average PE of 8.9 and a cash position representing nearly 50% of the market value, on the surface Unisys seems like a classical deep value play. However, Unisys has two major issues that are clearly depressing its value.1. Negative top-line growth. Unisys's revenues have been falling consistently year over year. Moving forward, it is necessary for the company to prove it can grow in order for its valuation multiples to expand.2. Pension liability > market capitalization. Unisys has a pension liability of approximately $1.6 billion. The pension obligation appears burdensome on the balance sheet, affects the bottom line via pension expense, and reduces cash flow via contributions.This article will primarily speak to the revenue growth issue as I believe that this will be the key to Unisys's market value going forward. While the pension liability is absolutely essential to valuing the company, I believe the issues relating to this factor are well-known and already largely reflected in current share price. Readers interested in a review of the pension liability issue are encouraged to consult an article by Seeking Alpha's Alpha Gen Capital which deals with this in some detail.Revenue OutlookSince 2004, Unisys has failed to produce YoY% revenue growth.Unisys's stated 2014-2016 plan is to primarily generate growth through their Technology business, a segment that makes up ~12% of total revenues, as of 2Q2014.It is crucial to understand that the ONLY sources of potential revenue growth that management has cited are two new technology products: Stealth and Forward!.Growth BreakdownThe following is management's intentions concerning the future growth of its portfolio.Clearly Unisys has bet their future growth on Stealth and Forward!. Moreover, after a series of interviews with management in September 2014, I have ascertained that Unisys has no clear plan for its massive cash balance. In other words, Unisys doesn't have any other tangible plans for growth that it is confident enough to speak about. Forward! and Stealth, as described by management, sound promising, but neither have proven themselves in the market yet. I describe both in detail below.StealthStealth marks the company's venture into cyber security, a $77 billion industry projected to have a CAGR of 10% over the next 10 years. Stealth is a unique cyber security software developed in conjunction with the Department of Defense.Typically, cyber security software uses encryption to prevent unauthorized users access, but Stealth works by making sensitive data, systems, and networks invisible to the potential hacker. Somewhat cleverly, Unisys markets stealth with the statement, ""You can't hack what you can't see.""Stealth was unveiled for commercial purposes in November 2008. 2011 was the first year Stealth was overtly mentioned in Unisys's Annual Report as a future source of growth. Since then it has won several awards and in 2013 it entered both the mobile and cloud computing markets. Yet Stealth still has not produced material revenue. It seems excessive that after nearly 8 years, Stealth has still been unable to produce any discernible sales (Stealth technology is even older as it was actually developed in 2005 for the Department of Defense). Furthermore, management refused to provide any guidance regarding the amount or timing of the revenue they think the product can eventually deliver.Forward!Forward!, is a computing platform for Intel-based servers developed with a clear value added message: to provide the cost effectiveness of Windows and Linux with the scalability and security of UNIX. Gartner has forecasted two-thirds of the UNIX market will migrate in the next five years, creating a roughly $5 billion opportunity for Unisys. Forward! is intended to be an alternative for those interested in leaving UNIX as Forward! is cheaper, more secure and equally as efficient.It is cheaper because Forward! uses Intel-based chipsets as opposed to UNIX, which uses proprietary chipsets. Forward! can reduce initial expenses by around 50% and reduce total cost of ownership by about 40%, when compared to UNIX.The product was launched in December 2013. Unfortunately, despite the promising description, the product has failed to generate any meaningful revenue for Unisys. In interviews, company management refused to provide any indication regarding the timing or extent of revenues that can be expected.Implications of Leadership TransitionThe choice to replace Coleman reflects poorly on Stealth and Forward! for two reasons.1. The release specifically states that the decision was made because of growth. Clearly the board is not satisfied with the growth agenda set by Coleman. As stated earlier, this growth agenda is Forward! and Stealth. Therefore, it is likely the board does not believe strongly in the products.2. Why does the board feel the need to change CEOs? Since arriving in 2008, Coleman has delivered results. He enacted an incredibly successful turnaround in his first three years. Unisys has paid down $1 billion in debt since 2008, turned negative operating margins into high single digit margins, and managed to create five years of positive Net Income and Free Cash Flow after being negative for four and three years, respectively. Coleman performed well. If he had not, it would have been difficult to isolate his removal to the failures of Stealth and Forward!. However, he actually delivered results so the cause of his removal is therefore more likely to have been associated with the shortcomings of Stealth and Forward!.Unisys put all its growth on the shoulders of Stealth and Forward!. Neither has produced yet and management has been vague about their future. These are Coleman's products and by not believing in Coleman, the board is likely implying they don't believe in Stealth or Forward!.ConclusionPrior to the announcement of Coleman's departure, I was on the fence with the potential of Stealth and Forward!. Although Stealth and Forward! sound promising, they have yet to generate revenue since their respective launches in November 2008 and December 2013. Furthermore, after interviewing management, it is clear that Unisys has no clear idea as to when, or even if, these products can expect to sell.In the 2Q13 Financial Release, CEO Coleman said, ""As with any disruptive technology, it takes time to educate the market on the new solution and drive sales among early adopters…"" This statement would maybe be slightly reassuring, if not for his removal a little over a year later.The parting of Coleman coupled with the lack of results from Stealth and Forward! suggest growth is not in the cards in the near future.On the other hand, Unisys has a large cash pile and evidently is focused on delivering growth. Thus, it is possible that the trajectory can be turned around. However, with the current portfolio of products the foreseeable future looks as if it will remain bleak."
3916276,93646,2016-02-22T11:55:01-05:00,The turnaround story is the main reason why most investors still own Unisys. I explain why the turnaround is not going to happen anytime soon.How much would you like to pay for a stock with a book value of -27.61 and falling revenues in an increasingly competitive environment if it is also quite overvalued?The stock has been significantly underperforming its peers and is strongly sensitive to market downturns.,"Company OverviewWhen asked why he works for Unisys (NYSE:UIS) during an interview at Business Rockstars, Tom Patterson, the company's vice president and general manager, had no difficulties describing the company's superiority over the competition. It is hard to deny the arguments mentioned sound rather convincing:It would be foolish to question the intelligence and experience of Tom Patterson. What can be questioned though, is the power of Unisys' competitive edge. A cocktail of good technology and a decent sales pitch shall continue bringing new customers to the company given its reputation, but it cannot exclude the possibility of underperformance periods, subject to which the company is right now. In addition, if the company has all the best corporate and governmental clients, where is the potential for future growth? And finally, where is the competition in that case?Not so far behind, it turns out.Prolonged TurnaroundUnisys remains quite strong at striking new deals. The recent NASA contract, announced on February 4, might be worth as much as $38.4 million in the best-case scenario. Unfortunately, the company seems to have reached its full potential many years ago. Its revenues and net profits have been subject to extreme fluctuations despite the numerous new contracts the company keeps announcing. The turnaround story is getting quite old.Net Sales of Unisys (In $ Thousands), Quarterly, June 1989-Present. Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon.Net Profits of Unisys (In $ Thousands), Quarterly, June 1989-Present. Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon.The table below summarizes the available data (From PR Newswire) on the main contracts the company has signed since 2013. It can be concluded that the rate of new contract announcements peaked in 2014. Even though it is difficult to make number-specific conclusions here due to the contracts' nature (the final value of the contracts might be subject to significant fluctuations; potential value has only been disclosed for a small part of the total Unisys' contract pool), it is hard to deny that the company has not been doing too well over the last two years. While the efficiency of the company's products is unquestionable, the efficiency of its contracts has been quite arguable. Meanwhile, as the company is slowing down the new contract announcement process, what can be expected from its revenues going forward given that it currently fails to proceed with its turnaround while working on its existing contracts? Moreover, can the company expect to return to profitability growth while the corporate profits are declining? Finally, can it at least maintain satisfactory financial performance to prevent the stock from falling further?Unisys' Number of Publicly Announced Contracts and Maximum Total Value of the (*) Contracts Value of Which Had Been Disclosed, 2013-2015. Source: PR Newswire.On the opposite side, Unisys has already managed to sign five new contracts during the first two months of 2016 (As opposed to only 3-4 contracts over the same period in 2013-2015). The related effect remains to be seen.Competition and New Product DevelopmentOne might argue that the company's underperformance is only seasonal, as it can be attributed to the high pace of new product announcements happening lately. Indeed, the company has managed to introduce (while continuing earning new awards and customer appreciation) a wide variety of new cutting-edge products in 2015. If the new product development would be to slow down in the coming quarters, it would be reasonable to expect higher margins, as well as higher probability of the company proceeding with its turnaround. Unfortunately, this argument does not hold because of the already decreasing R&D costs.Research & Development Expenses of Unisys (In $ Thousands), Quarterly, June 2007-Present. Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon.In addition, the frequency of new product-related PR announcements has actually been experiencing a slight decline throughout the 2015. However, since the company tends to announce O.S. upgrades and additional features for existing products, as well as given that it frequently announces multiple products at the same time, conclusions regarding the current rate of innovation (and its profitability) will only be possible to make in the future.Rising competition in the field contributes to the list of potential concerns, suggesting lower chances of the company postponing new product announcements in the coming years. It also makes me question the company's ability to sustain its competitive edge while significantly cutting its R&D budget, but this might be attributed to the company's reliance on its service business.Key Business Areas Are Getting Increasingly CrowdedThe majority of Unisys' revenues come from cloud and infrastructure services (46.5% as of the latest quarter), according to the company's presentation. While the company is currently struggling in this field, the rapidly-increasing usage rate of Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services is starting to enrage Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), increasing the chances of additional pressure and cost-cutting in the field. Meanwhile, how competitive the company really is if its piece of the cake is diminishing while the cake itself is growing?Source: Market Realist.It is possible to mention the seasonality of the company's revenues in the technology segment, which might suggest that the segment which has been demonstrating notable growth over 2015 will most probably underperform during the coming quarter, and historical net margins show that the December quarter is usually the strongest. While the two-year performance of Appliance Services segment looks strong, it is not yet capable of offsetting the falling revenues in cloud and technology.Source: Company's Presentation.Diversification has also proven to be of low benefit for the company.Source: Investor Relations Snapshot from the Company's Website.New Appointments, New CostsOn the bright side, the company's ongoing turnaround might benefit from the numerous new appointments it has made over 2015. The list of the newly-appointed managers includes the following people:At the same time, the leadership transition can also result in additional uncertainty concerning the company's ongoing turnaround. While the management changes demonstrated no clear contribution to the company's bottom line over this short period, I conclude that sufficiently more time is needed for this factor to become a potential catalyst and start working out (which might not be the case).Continuing the subject of new appointments, in the beginning of February, the company announced opening of a new office in Augusta, Georgia. It is hard to deny that the long-planned decision may pay off in the future, as the location will move the company closer to 1 of its largest clients - Augusta is already home to the Cyber Center of Excellence at Fort Gordon and is the future home of Army Cyber Command, according to the company's federal president. Nevertheless, the ambitious plans to hire nearly 700 new employees over the next years will have a notable impact on the company's bottom line in the medium term, supporting this short thesis.On March 12, 2015, the company announced establishment of a partnership with ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), aim of which is to deliver new integrated service management solutions. While the two companies have been successful in development of new product lines, of note is the fact that ServiceNow has been experiencing sluggish top-line performance lately. Just as a matter of coincidence, I have written a quite successful short thesis on this stock back in October.Underperforming the CompetitionThere has been seemingly no cost-cutting lately, and the competition might weigh on the company's ability to improve its margins in the coming future.Cost of Revenue and SG&A Expenses of Unisys (In $ Thousands), Quarterly, June 2007-Present. Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon.Returning to the topic of competition, Unisys is clearly lagging behind its competitors in a variety of metrics. However, increasing asset turnover is a bright sign.Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon.The company's financial performance has not been ignored.

Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon.Two-year Performance of UIS versus Peers. Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon.Before discussing the quality of the company's balance sheet, it is important to mention the negative book value per share, which places Unisys into an even worse position when compared with its peers. With no profits, an incalculable price/book and an EV/EBITDA of 7.9, the stock is clearly overvalued when compared with its competitors, especially if one takes into account the difference in operating performance. While the low EV/sales might look confusing for a second, it can be explained with a quite straightforward question: How much would you like to pay for a stock with a book value of -27.61 and falling revenues in an increasingly competitive environment given that it is also quite overvalued?Relative Valuation of Unisys Shares. Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon.Additional Areas of ConcernUnsurprisingly, return on equity has been red for years, but the recent values are incalculable because of the negative equity, which is persistent since 2008. In addition, both return on assets and return on fixed assets turned negative in the previous quarter and accounted for -4.59% and -12.3% during the latest quarter, respectively.Cash and Cash Equivalents of Unisys (In $ Thousands), Quarterly, June 2007-Present. Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon.The company's cash position is deteriorating, but it is still sufficient to cover its total debt of $312.3 million (As of the latest quarter). However, the total cash position accounts for only 37.63% and 10.37% of current and total liabilities, respectively.Moreover, of note is the fact that on September 25, 2015, the company decided to cancel its public offering of $350 million of senior secured notes it had announced just 4 days before. The company clearly expressed concerns in the market conditions: ""Current terms and conditions available in the market were not attractive for the Company to move forward."" While it is too early to expect liquidity problems in the nearest future, Unisys has clearly demonstrated that it has been cut from a pretty convenient source of financing - number of diluted average weighted shares has risen by 13.26% since December 2014. Most importantly, it has just demonstrated the real institutional investors' sentiment regarding its stock, suggesting that it would be reasonable to expect additional downside if more investors suddenly wake up from the negative equity nightmare.Speaking of institutional holdings, it can be concluded that large investors are mainly tolerating the company's poor financial performance for the time being. As long as institutional holdings remain quite high, the potential downside in case of largest investors divesting could be immense.Largest Institutional Holders of Unisys Shares as of December 31, 2015. Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon.Earnings ""Surprise"" and Investor SentimentThe stock has demonstrated a quite volatile earnings performance, making it quite difficult to predict its actual earnings going forward. What is more clear, however, is the fact that the share price will mostly suffer should earnings disappoint again. While the latest earnings release did not produce a negative seven-day price reaction since it outperformed the Non-GAAP estimates, it has actually produced a -89.5% earnings surprise for its GAAP estimates. Despite gaining almost 27% at one point, the stock retreated and finished the earnings announcement day with a 10% gain.Historical EPS Estimates for UIS (GAAP). Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon.While the stock has gone up by more than 7% since its latest earnings release, it is difficult to come up with potential catalysts for the coming weeks and even months. Trading volume has been below average during the last three upside days, share price movements during which averaged a gain of 2.59%.Even though the latest earnings estimates do not mean that analysts will be more successful in making predictions in the future, it is a good idea to check what the expectations for the next quarters are. As of February 20, the mean revenue estimate for the next quarter stands at 658.15, 16.68% lower than the latest quarter's reading (Eikon data). Revenue surprises varied between -3.9% and +4.6% over the last five quarters, making it 1 of the most accurately-estimated metrics of Unisys. It is important to note, however, that revenue misses were widely ignored during the last two earnings announcements as investors mostly focused on Non-GAAP EPS.Meanwhile, what can be said regarding the stock's sensitivity to increases in panic-boosted market sell-offs? While the short thesis can be treated as an isolated case of an underperforming company, I would also like to outline the impact that the current market conditions have on the stock.Since the 1st of July, average performance of UIS during the down days for S&P 500 has been -1.75%. During the days when S&P 500 has been falling by more than 1%, UIS has on average been experiencing a 2.67% decline.ConclusionThe company's case demonstrates a prolonged turnaround that has seemingly no end unless the business conditions significantly improve in the coming years. Quarter-to-quarter profit fluctuations are likely to happen, but the next quarter's results will most probably not deviate too much from the expectations of weaker top and bottom line figures, with seasonality, as well as earnings trend and estimates supporting this statement.Currently, Unisys does not have many aces up its sleeve:The question that still remains is, how far will the stock go?Source: Thomson Reuters Eikon.While the UIS options trading volume is quite low, July 15 put options with strike prices of $8 and $9 look extremely cheap, which was 1 of the main reasons this article has been written.As of February 19, 2016.

If we were talking about a blue chip, this would be a minor issue, but Unisys has a market capitalization of $650m and EBIT of $155m in 2014. In this article, I will discuss the assumptions of Unisys's U.S. DB (defined benefit) pension plan, and lay out scenarios as to how the deficit will affect the company over time.First some basics. On December 31, 2014, the U.S. DB deficit was $1.6bn, as can be seen in the table below.Source: 2014 10-KUsing cash flows during the next 10 years and total benefit obligations, as stated in the 10-K, I constructed a payment timeline that approximates reality. In addition I estimated investment returns for the long term in the table below.Source: weights from 10-K, where all non-fixed income investments like real estate are counted as equity.Assuming equity returns of 8% is by no means conservative, as a range of academic studies has established that risk premiums in recent years have been 3%-5% on top of the risk-free rate, which is 3%. The company thinks that returns of 7.72% are realistic, and even though that is not the highest expected return the company plans work with, they are probably too optimistic.Source: Author's own calculations. Expected return on assets is 6.56%, liabilities are debt plus future liabilities payments discounted using a 4.09% interest rate. The cost of debt is assumed to be equal to the expected fixed income return of 4%. Note that this is the current situation of the pension plan and does not take into account deposits by the company. All figures are year-end in USD mln.In the table above, we can see that if things don't change, the pension assets will have been reduced to zero by 2037, while liabilities at that point are still $1.6bn. After that date, underfunding grows because there are no assets to make the return to make up for the discounted liabilities.The table below shows the outcomes of different expected returns.Source: Expected return scenarios ran using the same table above.If the company achieves returns of 7% a year, the plan will find itself out of assets in 2041.Equity returns in 2015 have been poor and lagging the expected return by almost 13%-points (-6.2% S&P500, 6.66% expected equity return to date). If this does not recover by the year-end, assets will be $335m lower than planned just for the 58% equity part of assets. This brings underfunding to $1.9bn and the plan will have run out of assets in 2033 instead of 2038.What this all comes down to is how far the pension plan is a liability to the company. Even using an optimistic 7% return and taking on a lot of equity risk leaves the company with a huge liability. The way for Unisys to solve this problem is to put in $1 billion, which would solve the problem under my calculations above. Alternatively, the company can hope for 7.5% returns, but hope is not a strategy."
1553712,25047,2013-07-17T15:08:38-04:00,,"Looking at Unisys (NYSE:UIS) seems like looking at a dinosaur. The company has been around forever, with its roots in American Arithmometer Company, founded back in 1886. In this regard, Unysis is even older than International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), founded in 1911.The market seems to think the same. It seems to think that a giant asteroid hit Unisys' world, and that it's left for dead and has no chance of coming back. The asteroid could be client-server computing, cloud computing, the rise of the PC and a thousand other trends. Unisys is certainly seen as an obsolete provider of mainframe computing, with no place in today's world.But it reality consistent with this view? Perhaps not. After all IBM was once in Unisys' place and it came back. Indeed, it even got Warren Buffett interested. And today, IBM trades at a rich 8.9 times EV/EBITDA, as a result, even while showing slightly reclining revenues year-on-year.Let us look at Unisys, then, and see what we come up with.Revenues and businessOne thing that Unisys has are declining revenues.UIS Revenue TTM data by YChartsThese, however, are now expected to show an improving trend, with the decrease in revenues getting smaller. And indeed, consensus estimates for 2014 already show an expected stagnation in revenues (+0.6% year-on-year). This is not yet very evident in a revenue growth chart, though.UIS Revenue Quarterly YoY Growth data by YChartsUnisys revenues are very diversified geographically, but show a strong dependence on the public sector. This can be a problem in times of austerity. On the other hand, the revenues are now deeply slanted toward services, with these accounting for 86% of 2012's revenues. And technology revenues, while accounting for just 14% of revenues, were actually growing in 2012 (Source: company website).The segments above are described by the company as follows:Q1 2013The company reported a rough Q1 2013 quarter, with revenues down 12.8% and a negative $0.77 EPS compared to a positive $0.31 in the same quarter last year.The drop in revenues was made larger by the selling of a South African subsidiary. Without this the drop would have been -9%.A major contributor for the drop in revenues was the public sector, especially in terms of systems integration and outsourcing. This segment was down 31.2% year-on-year. The other segments did better, with outsourcing even growing slightly. Technology was also down though that's partially explained by a strong Q4 2012.The earnings from Q1 2013 brought down consensus earnings estimates significantly, with 2013 going from $3.50 to $1.64, a huge drop.ValuationThere are some valuation multiples which sound interesting about UIS. These would be:However, not all is so rosy. Unisys carries a shareholder deficit. It has no equity. If the current fundamental deterioration is not stopped, it will face significant financial difficulties down the road.Another problemUnisys has an underfunded pension fund. Many companies created these defined benefits pension funds in the past, and now suffer for it as they try to adjust to a smaller size with a battalion of former workers drawing from such funds.In Unisys' case, the fund will require a $142 million cash contribution during 2013. Together with capex, the pension fund seems likely to absorb all the cash that Unisys is likely to generate.ConclusionWhile Unisys could be an attractive investment as a bet on the tightening of the valuation differentials between it and IBM, there are several large problems which, for now, work against this investment. These include:All these put together work against owning Unisys except for in the context of a Fed-fueled party where everything goes up (and Unisys has been going up lately, as well, due to that). Unisys might turn into an investable security if it could contain the drop in its revenues quickly, though, so it might warrant monitoring.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Being a veteran in the IT industry, the company has suffered from declining revenues and shrinking margins, given its obsolete product portfolio, huge overcapacity, and a sizable unfunded pension liability - the main reason for negative equity.Following Unisys's third-quarter results, investors cheered the company's growing revenues and profitability sending shares up more than 30%.Chart 1 Q3 results pushed the stock towards its beginning year valueData by YChartsHowever, in our view, the market doesn't see the full upside potential of the company and still puts a great deal of emphasis on some of its unresolved issues, such as pension contributions paired with overall high debt levels, and overlooking improving growth dynamics and margins. There is this stigma surrounding Unisys, that it remains a restructuring case with an outdated product portfolio, declining sales, and shrinking margins.As we show in our extensive analysis (discussed below), this couldn't be further from the truth. The company has done its homework, such as cutting cost redundancies and upgrading its product portfolio. These measures should enable it to continue to leverage its new product offerings and resulting in solid double-digit growth rates in the mid-term paired with gradual margin improvements. We appreciate all these efforts and see a substantial upside potential of at least 30% and up to 80% in the next 2-3 years.Unisys started the year quite solid, with Q1 '19 sales climbing by 5.9% or 10% (fx adj.) to $694m on a non-GAAP basis (excl. restructuring reimbursement and one-off revenue gain) - the highest quarterly growth since 2014. This was also achieved despite the US government shutdown (the segment accounts for c. 20% of total revenue) as other segments recorded solid growth. In particular, the financial segment (c. 24% of sales) was up by 27%; public (excl. US federal) was up by 7% (fx adj.) benefiting from large deals signed in 2018 and commercial up by 8% (fx adj.) on the back of growing services revenue. However, adj. operating income/EBIT margin declined by 80bps y/y to 6.4% as new Services business costs weigh on margins.In the following quarters, Unisys continued to benefit from improving business momentum with 9M '19 sales surging by c. 12.0% (fx adj.) to $2.192b or 9.6% (incl. fx) on a non-GAAP, driven by the strong performance across all sectors. US Federal was leading the growth at 27.7% y/y resulting in an upgraded growth expectation for the full year 2019 to > 20% (in Q3) from previously high teens. In the Finance segment, the growth was also solid at 7.5% y/y, largely driven by the renewal schedule for ClearPath Forward product and new service business ramping up. The public sector, which includes all government and/or state projects oversees (excl. US government) picked up by 5.2% driven by large projects ramp-ups signed in 2018. On the other hand, the commercial segment saw its revenues declining by -4.7%, largely due to tough comparables in the Technology segment in Q3 '18.Chart 2 - Strong growth in the first 9M, as Unisys works through its backlogSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysThis strong performance in 9M '19 has also prompted the company to upgrade its topline guidance (for the second time; the first time was in Q1 '19) by an average of 1.5% (mid-point) to 3% - 7% growth from 2% - 5% growth. This, in turn, implies Q4 growth of up to 1.3% (assuming a 7% full-year growth rate) or a sharp decline of -13.4% (assuming a 3% full-year growth rate). Based on the rather uplifting tone of the Q3 conference call, we stick to the mid-point of the guidance and expect sales climbing to $2.917b in 2019 or 4.8% on a non-GAAP-basis.We emphasize, 2019 is an abnormally strong year and is mainly driven by new deals signings in 2018 with backlog surging 11.6% - we believe it is not sustainable going forward. In the mid-term, we expect to see moderate sales growth of 5.1% CAGR 2018-23 (non-GAAP), which is slightly exceeding the upper end of the group's mid-term sales growth range of 2% to 4%. We believe, Unisys will continue benefiting from its new product ramp-ups and selling in more into the existing customer base (i.e. upselling opportunities) and thereby increasing the customer's wallet share. As the management highlighted in its recent conference calls, the more security-centric product offerings (c. 20% of total sales) are boosting new contract signings - this trend should also prevail in the future. We emphasize Unisys is exposed to cyclical revenue swings: two years of revenue growth is usually followed by two years of revenue decline. We believe this should be the case in the upcoming two years. In particular looking at the current backlog levels, which were gradually declining in the past quarters (Q3: -14.3%; Q2: -6.5%; Q1: flat) - a proxy for future revenues.In addition, we want to highlight, that Unisys is trying to strike a balance between large deals (in particular for the public sector) and the usually high upfront investments required for such large contracts. This might potentially result in some lost revenues, given its high cash commitments for pensions. As we discuss later, Unisys has applied for the IRS waiver to delay cash contributions for its US-based pension plan. This would unleash the group's liquidity and would enable it to further engage in larger deals. However, we remain cautious that IRS will grant that waiver (at least in the amount applied) given the group's already high pension deficit, which will go up by the amount of deferred payment (i.e. $155m). In such a case, the stock reaction might be negative. However, we don't see it having a substantial impact on Unisys' performance as the company's mid-term growth guidance and our expectations don't include benefits of IRS waiver. It just represents an additional upside to our estimates, in case of a positive outcome.Chart 3 Mid-term upswing in revenues is expectedSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysServices segment - the key growth driver with a cyclical swing in the mid-termServices segment, which accounts for the bulk of group's sales (c. 85%) offers system integration solutions, enriched with proprietary security software as well as managed services and consulting. Unisys segregates its products into the following classes:Chart 4 Unisys fully-fledged cloud platformSource: plus530Chart 5 Cloud and Managed Services should be the key growth driversSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysIn the period 2015-18, Unisys has recorded moderate backlog growth of 3.7% CAGR, which was mainly boosted by double-digit growth in 2017-18 - the strongest years in its recent history. The company saw, in particular, a surge in the public (incl. US Federal sector) and commercial sectors as new products as well as better product bundling (i.e. CloudForte, InteliServe) have been positively received by the customers, leading up to some large contract signings (DISA contract worth $214m; US Federal Agencies contracts worth $252m, to name just a few). Such a high upsurge in the backlog activity is not sustainable, as per the management, and is not required to achieve its mid-term growth targets (i.e. sales growth +2% to +4%). In fact, in 3Q '19 the backlog volume was sagging, posting -14.3% decline while competing with the +32.4% last year - the highest growth since 1999. According to the company, the US Federal sector recorded -12% y/y decline in the quarter. However, including unfunded backlog, which represents the total future revenue potential, the backlog was growing (not disclosed). For the remainder of the year, we see some further decline in the backlog by c. -5% y/y, which we believe is a rather sustainable level going forward.We also want to highlight the differences in the sales cycles in each segment, which has an impact on revenues as well as profitability. According to the management, public deals have longer transition periods, with initial drag on the margins followed by gradual improvement over time. In addition, there is more chance to increase customer's wallet share thereby driving upselling opportunities. This contrasts with the US Federal deals, which have a rather limited upselling potential and a stable margin profile, as transition periods are much shorter compared to the public sector.To stay more realistic, we try to reflect the historical growth pattern with two years of backlog decline followed by another two years of the backlog surge. This implies, that following -5% decline in 2019, we expect to see another soft year (i.e. 2020) of -2% while consequently climbing by 10% and 12%, in the subsequent years, respectively.Chart 5 Sales follow cyclical backlog developmentSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysUnisys doesn't disclose information regarding the order intake for its Services segment. However, we made an attempt to calculate it for the past years as well as make projections for future periods. Given the available information: 1) order backlog; 2) amount of converted sales next year and 3) actual sales realized, we estimate new business grew at 3.3% CAGR 2015-18 with the sizable growth acceleration in 2018 - break threw year for the company. As mentioned earlier, the order backlog climbed by 11.6% - the highest growth in recent history, supported by multiple public (incl. US Federal) and commercial sector projects. Going forward, we assume the new business growth continues to improve to 8.2% CAGR as the share of cross-and upselling rises paired with the going-to-market strategy and a more targeted selling approach. However, we point out, new business development is highly unpredictable, as it largely project-based business with more than 40% of the revenues generated in the public sector which is susceptible to the budget cuts.Chart 6 Estimated new business is set to grow with a cyclical swingSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysTechnology segment benefits from the revolving product portfolioTechnology segment, which represents roughly 15% of the total sales is the domain of its stand-alone, in house development solutions, such as ClearPath Forward and Stealth, the system of record (hardware + software) and security software, respectively. Unisys has been modernizing its product offering in this segment, and now offers its ClearPath Forward on Intel x86 server platform - reflecting the customer needs. For its Slealth security software, it has expanded it to cloud, now leveraging Microsoft Azure for additional security for clients accessing cloud-based Azure Services. Those improvements have also resulted in accelerating demand for Stealth products (+94% y/y in 2018) and new deal signings, for instance with the US Department of Defense, which rolling out it across several U.S. Department of Defense organizations.Chart 7 Improved Stealth product is the key for successSource: UnisysFor this segment, Unisys has pretty decent visibility into the year, in particular for its ClearPath Forward renewal schedule, given its strong installed base. For all other products, the revenue profile is rather bulky, owned to its project-driven revenue structure (i.e. license sales). In line with the strategy of a more security-focused portfolio approach, the company has recently started to bundle it's Service product offerings with its Technology products, which should drive the group's cross-selling arrangements and improve its overall margin profile. This is not yet fully reflected in market expectations, as this bundling strategy is quite new. We believe, the progress can be tracked with the intersegment Technology revenues (i.e. security products sold to the Services segment, which are repackaged and resold to the Services customers). In the past, these internally generated sales accounted for c. 20% of the total Technology sales, however in the recent three years (2016-18), its share declined to c. 5.5%. It's a rather odd observation that also contradicts the company's wording. We would appreciate it if Unisys will elaborate on this at some point.In terms of performance, Q3 '19 revenues surged by 25.2% baked by 1) solid pipeline development; and 2) pull - forward effect from renewals in ClearPath Forward products. The growth, however, was below the management expectations, as one large contract was pushed into Q4 '19.Overall, 9M '19 sales dynamics improved to 14.9% y/y growth compared to -4.2% decline in the prior year as product renewal (i.e. ClearPath Forward) and strong growth in commercial and US Federal sectors (i.e. Stealth) helped with the growth. Given that most of the contract renewal took place in the first half of this year, combined with the flat the full-year revenue growth guidance, Q4 sales should decline sharply by -26.1%. We reckon the decline can be exacerbated if Unisys fails (for some reason) to sign this large deal mentioned above.Overall, sales growth is largely dependent on the following factors: 1) renewal schedule for its ClearPath Forward business; 2) new business generation, in particular for Stealth products and 3) cross-selling activities. We believe, Unisys will continue to push its new products and finally breaking the pattern of declining revenues (i.e. -2% CAGR) and moving into a growth trajectory of +3.6% CAGR in the mid-term. We stress that sales can be rather lumpy and subject to project delays, potentially resulting in some unwanted volatility.Chart 8 Technology to start gradually gaining more tractionSource: Image created by the author with data from Unisys* excl. $53 one-off salesGradual profitability improvement is expected amid restructuring savings and better product mix in the Services businessIn 9M '19, profitability has also improved with adj. EBIT margin (company defined) went up by 140bps to 9.1% - upper end of the guidance (confirmed). This is mainly the result of strong growth in the enterprise/commercial segment (excl. US Federal) and improving cost structure (amid restructuring). We highlight, profitability was burdened by a high share of third party hardware sales in the Technology segment in Q3, which we estimate to have around 40bps negative impact.In the Services segment (c. 38% total non-GAAP operating income), the margin has improved moderately by 104bps to 3.95% vs 2.91% last year. This was mainly achieved through better margins in enterprise solutions (excl. US Federal) as well as partially due to an increasing share of US Federal projects. As mentioned before, they have shorter transitional periods and therefore get faster to their profitability run rate compared to the public sector, with much longer transaction periods. According to the management, the productizing or bundling of services solutions helped the company to require higher margins, similar to its Technology sector, which otherwise wouldn't be possible.Management reiterated its profitability guidance, with adj. operating income margin between 8.25% to 9.25% and 14.4% to 16.0% for adj. EBITDA. Given strong profitability expansion in 9M '19 and assuming the company would hit the upper end of the guidance (i.e. 9.25%) for the full-year, Q4 adj. EBIT margin should move up to 9.7% - a decline of 220bps vs last year of 11.9%, which largely explained by transition costs and unfavorable product mix in the Technology segment. The decline of 600% or 5.9% margin would be much more pronounced, assuming a full-year margin of 8.25% (lower-end of the guidance). However, we give the company the benefit of the doubt and trending towards the upper- end of the adj. EBIT margin guidance of 9.25%.We highlight, Unisys' non-GAAP operating profitability excludes pension expenses, which would burden the margin by c. 330bps. We believe, the company strives to avoid additional volatility in its earnings caused by interest rate fluctuations, showing the pure operating dynamics. However, we view this approach as quite an aggressive, since it overestimates the actual margin profile. For forecasting purposes, we will comply with the company's definitions.Chart 9 9M '19 delivered some solid margin expansion amid transition costs and adverse product mixSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysGoing forward, we believe Unisys will continue to drive its profitability, with non-GAAP operating income margin improving gradually towards 11% translating into 220bps improvement by 2023. The key profitability drivers should be:Chart 10 Gradual margin improvement in the Services segment expectedSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysExcursion: Restructuring activities are overIn 2015 Unisys announced its multiyear restructuring plan with the goal to 1) create a more competitive cost structure, targeting its Service segment in particular, and 2) rebalance the global skill set. Over the course of the next four years (2015-18), Unisys reduced its total workforce by c.30% (6.286 employees) both in its US and international operations. We calculate, the total restructuring costs amounted to $381m with a total annual cost savings of $270m - higher than what the company originally expected. Adjusted or non-GAAP operating income/EBIT margin has also seen some moderate improvement of 220bps (starting point 2014, pre-restructuring levels). However, we estimate that the annual cost savings run rate of $270m should have brought much more pronounced margin improvement of c. 7ppt to 9ppt (depending on the level of revenue) compared to the realized 220bps (we assume 2019 margin of 9.1% - the same level as in 9M '19). The company didn't elaborate on it (we believe such a question wasn't asked), however, the general explanation for such sluggish margin development was 1) new business in the Service segment with initially high costs and 2) unfavorable product mix in the Technology segment (i.e. more 3rd party hardware). Going forward, we assume no restructuring activities as stated by the company.Chart 11 Restructuring brought a lot of savings, however, margin doesn't reflect themSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysOne of the biggest issues Unisys has is its largely unfunded pension liability for its US and international operations. It's one of the reasons the company continues to have what we call a disastrous capital structure, translating into negative equity. This problem became especially more acute in the low-interest-rate environment, giving rise to growing pension liability and low asset returns, impacting negatively the value of plan assets.The company has also demonstrated the so-called elasticity of returns or interest rates on pension liabilities and plan assets, stating:This example clearly demonstrates, how much plan assets need to return in order to offset rising pension levels caused by this minor interest rate reduction.Over the course of its restructuring, the company has been able to negotiate with its former employees lump-sum payments, thereby reducing its pension deficit by around 8%. As previously mentioned, Unisys applied for the IRS waiver. In case of a positive outcome (highly unlikely), Unisys will see its pension deficit rising again, potentially making it difficult to apply for the necessary refinancing of its senior note due 2022, with an early redemption option next year (discussed below).Chart 12 Pension deficit is still an unresolved issueSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysIt is also interesting to pay a closer look at the development of cash contributions versus pension expenses. The ratio (i.e. cash contributions to pension expenses) of these two has been extremely volatile over the years ranging between 1.13 (FY2018) to 1.77 (FY 2016). However, the general consensus is that cash contributions are much higher than pension expenses booked in the income statement. This is reasonable given such a high pension deficit. Overall, the development of pension deficit as well as cash contributions is a rather complex topic with a multitude of variables hard to predict. For forecasting purposes, we assumed a ratio of 1.53 for the foreseeable future.As can be seen, Unisys is facing a significant surge in its cash contributions in 2020 to $289m from an expected $103m in 2019 - an increase of $186m, of which $115m should be used for its US pension plan. According to the press release, Unisys seeks the IRS waiver for $115m, which will allow it to spread this contribution over a five year period. This will, in turn, improve the group's liquidity position and will enable it to engage in larger Service projects, which require high capital investments at the outset, thereby boosting the group's top and bottom line. We believe, the waiver approval is not likely, given the already high pension deficit, which will increase it even further in the case of the payment deferral.Chart 13 Unisys is expected to pay more cash to fund its pension deficitSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysLooking further into the financial liability profile, Unisys carries in total $577m in debt, which is comprised of 1) senior secured note with a coupon of 10.75% with a total face value of $400m due 2022 and 2) convertible note with a coupon of 5.5% and a total residual face value of $84m due 2021. In August '19 Unisys agreed to exchange, in a private transaction, $130m of its convertible note into c. 10.6m of its common stock and pay residual $59.4m in cash. As a result of the partial note redemption, the group's indebtedness (incl. financial liabilities and pension deficit) shrunk by c. 8% to $2.4b. We highlight, according to the terms of the senior secured note, Unisys is not allowed to distribute any dividends as well buyback its shares.According to the management, refinancing of the above mentioned senior note is considered and they are ""looking into that"". In case the refinancing will be achieved, Unisys can cut its high-interest expense. We believe, some newsflow should be expected in early 2020. However, for the time, we assume no change in the current debt structure.Overall, Unisys has a rather weak capital structure with high debt levels and negative equity (i.e. deficit), resulting in high financial leverage. We don't think it will be easy to reverse this situation even with 1) rising profitability - EBITDA up by 4.6% CAGR 2019-23 and 2) pension deficit gradual declining by 3% y/y - optimistic assumption with no IRS waiver. We believe, Unisys will require more than three years to see some meaningful leverage improvement (i.e. Debt/EBITDA) to 5.6x from 7.0x in 2018. As mentioned above, Unisys is considering spreading some of its pension contributions over the next years, thereby adding more to the already high debt levels, in case of approval.Table 1 High financial leverage is not easy to shake offSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysLiquidity is also an issue for Unisys, with the key cash flow outlays being:All the above-mentioned factors result in a rather weak FCF profile. In fact, we expect negative FCF (unadjusted) figures to prevail in the future, which rising profitability doesn't offset. For the purposes of our forecast, we don't assume any pension cash deferral (i.e. IRS waiver).According to our estimates, Unisys should stop burning cash by 2023, at which point we see its FCF situation improving significantly to $72m in 2024 towards $246m by 2026.As mentioned above, Unisys is restricted from paying any dividends and stock buyback as per its senior notes agreement.Table 2 High pension contribution and capex put a drag on FCF developmentSource: Image created by the author with data from UnisysFollowing Q3 results, the stock surged by 35% and is now residing at the beginning year levels. With the following valuation approaches, we try to determine, whether there is still some upside potential for the stock. And as it turns out is quite substantial.Peer multiples range between 14.2x and 15.5x EV/EBITDA and 23.2x and 24.7x P/E for 2019-21, respectively. Those contrast significantly to Unisys 2.1x to 2.7x EV/EBITDA (incl. pension expense) and 22.6x to 10.9x - implying up to 84% discount to peers (such as IBM (IBM), Accenture (ACN), Amadeus (OTCPK:AMADF), to name just a few.We didn't include any historical valuation, given high restructuring costs which negatively impacted both top and bottom lines of Unisys.We believe, Unisys has done its homework and cleared up the majority of its redundancy in the product portfolio and the cost structure. The turnaround started last year with a sizable increase in order backlog, which Unisys is successfully converting into revenue this year. Past restructuring activities as well as improving margin dynamics in its main Services business result in a gradual profitability improvement. We point out, that Unisys's performance is exposed to cyclical swings, which we expect to see in the next coming years, with some soft revenue decline. Followed by two years of subdued performance, we expect to see a positive cyclical swing with a double-digit sales growth and margin improvement. However, we emphasize, Unisys has high cash commitments both for its unfunded pensions and capex, which result in the negative FCF in the mid-term. Despite all that, we see substantial upside potential for the stock, as implied by fundamental and peer valuation."
2832766,68695,2015-01-20T11:20:05-05:00,"Cash bond markets are significantly overstating Unisys Corporation's credit risk with YTW of 4.296%. CDS markets are also overstating credit risk with CDS at 252bps.Moody’s is ignoring UIS’ fundamentals with its B1 rating, which indicates that the company is a highly speculative, high-yield investment.Fundamental analysis of UIS highlights robust cash flows, substantial cash on hand, and limited debt maturities.These factors drive a far safer 2.466% Intrinsic YTW, 148bps Intrinsic CDS and Valens Credit rating of IG4+ (equivalent to Moody’s Baa1).","SummaryMoody's highly speculative, high-yield B1 credit rating on Unisys Corporation (NYSE:UIS) materially overstates the company's credit risk. UIS' fundamentals show that their cash flow alone would exceed all their operating obligations, with any small cash shortfall from their 2017 debt maturity covered by their cash on hand. UIS also has the flexibility to access the capital markets and its revolvers for financial expansion, with a neutral recovery rate driven by favorable working capital and relatively new assets. Together, these factors drive a lower-medium investment grade IG4+ (equivalent to Baa1) rating from Valens Credit that is six notches higher than Moody's rating.Cash bond markets are also materially overstating UIS' credit risk with cash bond YTW of 4.296%, while CDS markets are overstating credit risk with CDS at 252bps. Valens' fundamental analysis drives an Intrinsic CDS (iCDS) of 148bps and an Intrinsic YTW (iYTW) of 2.466%. Credit market spreads are expected to tighten toward those levels as credit markets better understand UIS' credit profile.Cash Flow ProfileValens Credit produced a Credit Cash Flow Prime chart for Unisys Corporation, as it does for every company it evaluates. The chart provides a far more comprehensive view of credit fundamentals than traditional ratio-based analyses. It shows the cash flow generation and cash obligations related to the credit of the firm, adjusted for non-cash financial statement reporting distortions from GAAP. The blue line indicates the gross cash earnings (Valens' scrubbed cash flow number) expected to be generated based on consensus analyst estimates and Valens Credit's own in-house research team. The blue dots above that line include the cash available when cash on the books and existing, available credit lines are used.The colored, stacked bars show the cash obligations of the company in each year forecast. The most difficult obligations to avoid are at the bottom of each stack, such as interest expense. The obligations with more flexibility to defer year to year, such as pension contributions and maintenance capital expenditures, are at the top of the stacked bars. All of the calculations are adjusted for non-cash distortions that are inherent in GAAP accounting, including the highly problematic (and often misused) statement of cash flows.If the company generates and has cash levels that are above their obligations, the risk of default is extremely low such as with UIS. Even if the cash generated yearly is close to the levels of the stacked bars, a company generally has the flexibility to defer payments of various kinds. For example, they can allow assets to age a little longer, or they can cut certain maintenance costs such as R&D. While decisions such as those can create other business concerns, the issue in credit risk is simply 'can the company pay their credit obligations?'UIS is expected to generate enough gross cash earnings to exceed operating obligations for the next seven years. Only in 2017 do gross cash earnings fall short (barely) when the company has to service a $215 million debt maturity. This should not be a concern for UIS, since they have robust cash on hand to cover the shortfall. UIS currently has $477 million in cash on hand that is expected to increase to over $1.1 billion by 2020, which would easily cover all of the company's 2017 obligations.Management IncentivesLike most people, senior executives and board members do what they are paid to do. This is why UIS' Form DEF 14A is key to understanding this company's fundamentals, something that credit agencies seem to be completely missing. Valens' Incentives Dictate Behavior analysis focuses on a company's senior executive compensation and governance. This analysis is meant to help investors understand corporate governance, how aligned a management team may be with shareholder interests, and the potential consequences of a management compensation framework to the business.UIS' management compensation is based on pre-tax profit, free cash flow, and revenue growth. This compensation framework is favorable for creditors, since it focuses management on all three value drivers: margins, asset utilization, and revenue growth. The pre-tax profit metric should drive management to focus on profitability, while the free cash flow metric would motivate them to manage working capital and capex while growing the business. Lastly, the revenue metric would encourage them to utilize their capabilities to grow the overall business.Management's compensation framework is thus likely to lead to a better ROA (Valens' Adjusted Return on Assets number) for the company, which would result in better cash flows to service their obligations.Management RepresentationsValens provides analyses of companies' statements on earnings calls, termed Management Representation Benchmarking. This analysis is meant to help assess a management team's confidence in their conference calls when discussing certain areas of the business such as operations, stability, strategies, and ability to manage business risks, and especially their liquidity and solvency.In the case of UIS, the analysis of their Q3 2014 earnings call highlighted some concerns. Management seemed concerned when talking about their pension expense and growing debt balance. They also seemed concerned about their ability to sustain revenue growth in the Asia Pacific. Finally, they may be overselling the capabilities of their new platform, especially its adoption of Intel's x-86 architecture and the investments they have allocated in Forward and Stealth.Generally, management was concerned about factors that could affect their cash flows. However, the company's cash on hand and projected cash build would still provide a considerable buffer even in case cash flows do suffer.ConclusionA company's credit risk (or lack thereof) is driven by cash available against cash obligations. Credit markets and ratings agencies may be fixating on UIS' pension funding and not entirely recognizing the other aspects of UIS' cash position. Moody's and cash bond markets are materially overstating UIS' fundamental credit risk. While the overstatement is not as great, CDS markets are also overstating UIS' credit risk. UIS' ratings should improve and credit market spreads should tighten once credit markets and ratings agencies better understand the company's true credit profile.Valens Credit Ratings are those made by the Valens Credit organization, determined by a ratings committee in a systematic process, and not the opinion of any single person.Our Chief Investment Strategist, Joel Litman, chairs the Valens Credit ratings committee.

2514175,54942,2014-09-24T05:00:00-04:00,"The company's share price is trading based on interest rates due to the large underfunded pension plan. Over the last few weeks, that link has broken possibly creating an opportunity.The company has launched several new products in the technology division while restructuring their services business more towards faster growing IT outsourcing.The shares are ripe for a takeover or some activist shareholder becoming involved. If that occurs, look for the shares to be significantly re-rated as they push for change.","Unisys (NYSE:UIS) is an acquirer's or activist's dream. The company is significantly undervalued, under-levered, and awash in cash. An acquirer or activist can enter the name and restructure quickly and see significant value in short order. The company's core services operations have been affected by a shift towards cloud-based solutions delivered on demand via SaaS delivery models. In addition, one of their larger challenges on the services side of the operation is in their project-based systems integration business. Like their competition, they are seeing client buying patterns move away from traditional large multi-year customized systems integration projects and towards shorter-term packaged projects that can be installed quickly with less risk. Their services portfolio is currently being restructured but fiscal 2014 appears to be another lost year with small percentage declines expected. However, as they reposition their systems integration business while addressing disruptive technologies of social, mobility, and big data, the company should start to see top line growth for the first time in many years in fiscal 2015.However, the current share price is not reflective of that reality but instead trades based on interest rates due to the company's severely underfunded pension plan. As interest rates rise, we think the pension plan issue will be largely resolved and investors will again focus on the business fundamentals driving the stock higher.Business OverviewUnisys is a global information technology services company providing a portfolio of IT services, software, and technology that solves ""mission-critical"" problems for its clients. Essentially, they are an IT outsourcing firm which companies hire to increase their efficiency and utilization of data centers, secure operations from outside threats, modernize enterprise applications and enhance support to their end users.The company operates two business segments: services and technology. Services is by far the larger of the two representing 87% of total revenue. The technology segment is a seller of hardware, mainly high-end mainframe servers for small and medium-sized businesses.(Source: 2013 10-K)Changing Company Dynamics HeadwindThe services segment provides outsourcing, systems integration, and consulting work for clients. Overall, it is a low margin business and competes heavily against IBM, Accenture, Cognizant, and Wipro. However, the technology segment which sells mainframe servers is a much more profitable business. The segment designs and develops servers and related products to help clients reduce costs, improve security, and improve the efficiencies of their data centers.The technology segment carries operating income margins of 21.1% versus the services segment which has margins around 6.2%, both in fiscal 2013. While the technology segment contributes just 13% of revenues, it contributes over one-third of EBIT. The business has suffered in recent years along with most other hardware manufacturers. In fiscal 2013, revenues in the segment were $460.4 million, down from $560.8 million in 2009 and $514 million last year.Revenues company-wide have been in what seems to be perpetual decline. In fiscal 2004, revenues were over $5.8 billion but by last year, were down to $3.45 billion. That is a negative 6% CAGR over the time period while EBITDA has fallen to $379 million from $682 million in fiscal 2009.The negativity aside, the firm appears poised to be righting the ship and is likely popping on the radar of many private equity and larger IT services firms. The acquisition, depending on the ultimate price involved, would likely be immediately accretive to the buyer.Long ThesisThere are several points that point to a bullish story:1) The company is largely trading based on the pension plan, which was severely underfunded. As interest rates rise, the plan becomes more adequately funded.2) Valuations are extraordinarily cheap with the firm trading at 3.7x ttm EV/EBITDA and a forward P/E of 8.8x with the cash.3) The deleveraging of the firm over the last several years has removed the overhang of the ""debt situation"" and that, along with the large cash position, is likely to invite an acquirer or activist.4) The company has significant margin expansion opportunities by sourcing labor from low cost locales as well as other cost savings initiatives. The company is a much higher cost operator than the competition.5) New products in their mainframe business are the premier in the space and could turn around the struggling mainframe business.Pension Plan UnderfundedA lot of investors classify Unisys as a pension plan administrator that happens to sell mainframes and operate an IT services business on the side. The market drop in 2008 and 2009 created a significant underfunding of their pension plan with the funding status going from a $230 million surplus in 2007 to a $1.33 billion deficit in 2008. The underfunding went as low as $2.41 billion in fiscal 2012. In 2013, the plan assets experienced a boost from the market even as the discount rate moved nearly 2 points lower, which sent the deficit back to down $1.4 billion.(Source: Bloomberg)The interest cost is the primary driver of the pension benefit obligation (PBO) for Unisys since the number of employees has been reduced significantly over the years. The interest cost represents the interest accumulated on the unpaid balance of the projected benefit obligation as an employee's service time increases. With each year of service, employees are that much closer to retirement pushing up that cost. In Unisys's case, that is much more so as the average age of the participants increases fast as the company does not hire many new workers. As interest rates increase (if they do), the discount rate will also increase which will cause the PBO to decline making the funding status more healthy. Also, as the discount rises, service cost decreases and should reduce pension expense on the income statement boosting earnings.The short-term move in interest rates the last couple of weeks has not seen a commensurate move in the share price. We think this presents a short-term trading opportunity as the stock has traded very closely with the 10-year US Government yield. That is demonstrated below. The green line is the 10-year yield with the white line and blue shadow the share price. The correlation is very tight.(Source: Bloomberg)As rates rise, which we think they will gradually over time, it should wipe out the plan underfunding. It will not take much of a discount rate increase for the entire underfunding to dissipate. We estimate a 100 bps move higher in the discount rate would eliminate nearly $1 billion of the pension underfunding. At that point, the stock will likely cease being traded based on interest rates and more so on their long-term potential for a turnaround in the fundamentals of the business.Another potential catalyst would be if the firm is able to sell off their pension liability through offloading or 'selling' the liabilities to an insurance company who could convert them into annuities. Mercer, one of the largest pension consulting firms, said pension funds will increasingly parcel up their liabilities into smaller pieces. In addition, given the vastly improved funding level of the plan, they can conduct a pension buyout or lump-sum offer. This has been happening with more frequency in 2014. General Motors and Verizon Communications have conducted similar operations since the financial crisis. But companies now have more favorable funding levels and will take advantage of the chance to offload these risks and focus on their core operations. Verizon conducted an annuity buyout last year worth $7.5 billion. GM's last year was worth $28 billion in both lump sums and annuities.Extremely Cheap ValuationWe think that investors' focus on the underfunded pension plan has resulted in the shares trading at ridiculously cheap valuations, even factoring in a further deterioration of the core businesses. The forward P/E is now just above 7.0x including the nearly $575 million in cash (or $11.34 per share, 50% of the market cap). Ex-cash, the stock is trading at 4.4x fiscal 2015 P/E.On an EV/EBITDA basis, the stock is trading at 3.5x including the cash. Ex-cash, the shares trade at a microscopic 2.6x EBITDA. Free cash flow yield is above 8%. These are close to liquidation levels. We think the shares are worth considerably more than the current valuation would suggest even if the current trends continue. However, upside is highly tied to the restructuring plan taking hold and gaining traction over the next several quarters.Unisys is one of the few companies that has reduced operating costs alongside the reduction in revenues. Typically, firms see a lag between their revenue reductions and the shedding of operating expenses. Meanwhile, they have been retooling their product offering to become more competitive in the near and long term while cleaning up their balance sheet lowering their risk levels.Strong Deleveraging of the Firm Creates SustainabilityThree years ago, the company initiated a plan to reduce their large debt load that was hampering growth and creating an overhang for investors who would otherwise go long the shares. At the end of fiscal 2013, the company reached their aggressive goal of reducing debt by 75% from September 2010 levels. Outstanding debt has been reduced by approximately $1 billion since 2008 and now stands at $210 million, resulting in net debt of -$364 million.As a result of these steps, interest expense has been reduced by an annual run rate of over $90 million, to just $2.3 million in the second quarter of 2014 or a $9.2 million run rate. The credit agencies have been upgrading their debt along the way with the credits now rated BB- with a stable outlook by S&P and B1 with a stable outlook by Moody's. The $210 million that is left outstanding matures in August 2017 and carries a 6.25% coupon. We think this will either be refinanced in the near term or called and all debt extinguished.The $90 million in lower interest expense equates to nearly $1.78 per share in added earnings. That is the primary reason for the significant boost in expected EPS. When you combine this with their other restructuring initiatives including the simplifying of their operations and reducing headcount and other costs, gives the company a much stronger and competitive foundation going into the next year.Opportunities for Margin Expansion and StabilizationIn fiscal 2013, the company stabilized their technology business, which had been in steady decline over the prior several years. The technology segment has a much larger margin so any stabilization and recovery is likely to drive firm-wide margins higher. Management hopes to build on their streamlined cost structure and restart growth on the top line.Margins today are very low despite management staying ahead of the revenue slowdown and deleveraging. If the company can stabilize the revenue decline through the launch of new products in addition to the transition into outsourcing services, margins should begin to lurch higher. These new products in the technology space should at least stabilize the segment, but more likely lead to growth this year and more so next. As that occurs, margins should experience a sizeable expansion.The market is currently anticipating some of this to occur. The current expectations for fiscal 2014 look for operating income of $131 million on sales of $3.32 billion. But for fiscal 2015, that is expected to increase to $237 million on sales of $3.38 billion. Operating margins of 3.9% this year are thus expected to expand out significantly to just over 7%. We think this could be just the start on their way to as much as 10%-12% as the new products take hold and they can begin leveraging their sales again.Building their New Product LineupThe company is anticipating strong technology segment performance in the second half of the year. This is being driven by their ClearPath, Stealth, and Forward! products. Within their managed services business, their cloud and software as a service delivery models are showing the most strength with a shift towards IT outsourcing business.The Stealth family of cybersecurity software recently won the 2014 American Technology award for cyber security from the TechAmerica Foundation. It has also been named a finalist for the product of the year for 2014 American Business Awards in the software security category. The company launched the product several years ago but recently (less than two years ago) moved the product to a new channel program essentially moving the company from a partner mode to a vendor mode. The company has stated that they've seen increased market interest and are building a pipeline of first-time buyers.The larger product launch is their high end server product Forward, a fabric computing platform that unites strategic pieces of Unisys' mainframe engineering smarts with Intel processors. This new version introduced last quarter has more power and expanded functionality. The new x86 processors offer an alternative to proprietary Unix systems and virtualized environments for running their mission-critical applications.Then there is ClearPath, their flagship family of enterprise servers. This segment has had growth in three of the last four years despite the weakness in the business itself. Management noted that there is a sizeable pipeline of demand and that the back half of the year should see sizeable traction in growth. The new models also use Intel processors from the low-end to the high-end, ending a decade long shift away from their own CMOS chip technology. This should open up the market somewhat to additional potential clients.Lastly, they are changing their services offerings to better reflect the shift in demand from disruptive technologies. The shift should return the segment to at least moderate growth over the medium term. IT outsourcing revenues in the quarter received a significant boost driven by a large outsourcing contract award from the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The company was hired to create and operate one of the largest secure cloud-based IT implementations by a US state government. They will consolidate seven separate data centers into a secure hybrid cloud environment that will allow state agencies to procure computing services on demand. The total contract is valued at $681 million over seven years with three additional one-year options. The end result will likely be win-win for both parties as the state will be able to reduce their operating costs while enhancing flexibility and service delivery.(Source: Second Quarter Earnings Presentation 2014)The above bar graph on the left side illustrates their growth opportunities. Their future growth potential resides primarily within the BPO and ITO spaces. These are much faster growing and where the industry is primarily headed due to lower cost and better returns on investment. The company continues to restructure their services portfolio towards looking more like Cognizant and WiPro which have realized much faster growth over the last several years. If they can achieve even a small part of the same organizational efficiency and position themselves firmly in the space, they can significantly re-rate the stock.The systems integration segment has experienced a bit of a slowdown in the last two years. Execution and cloud-computing are the main culprits. Management is repositioning the segment to take advantage of new technologies while shedding unprofitable projects. As they stabilize the systems integration business over the next few quarters and increase exposure to the faster growing BPO and ITO segments, the top line growth should accelerate materially.Financial Goals in the Near Term (2014-2016)Due to the challenges experienced in the first half of the year, the company is expecting its services business to realize low single digit percentage declines in fiscal 2014. Given that systems integration has traditionally been a higher margin services area for the company, the decline will hamper the ability of the company to achieve their 8% to 10% operating profit margin. As we noted above, the market is currently expecting less than half the low end of that range at 3.9%.On the technology side, the company expects to see revenue growth this year despite some delays in new orders. On the conference call, they noted that the range for segment revenue this year is now $470 to $500 million which is still growth over the fiscal 2013 rate of $460 million, but slightly lower than their original $500 million estimate. However, they did note that revenue from their newer Stealth and Forward product lines will be incremental to this.The company laid out their financial goals for the near-term including growing the technology business, increasing the percentage of revenue generated by their reseller channel, consistently achieve an 8%-10% services operating income margin, and continue to simplify operations and reduce cost of services delivery. We think any stumble in their pursuit of those goals will open up the company to an activist or acquisition, providing some downside protection in the shares.ValuationThe company generated $336 million in EBITDA in 2013 and is trading at just 2.5x that figure. We think the company can stabilize EBITDA in the second half of this year- 2014 in aggregate is likely a completely lost year- but given the weakness in the first half, EBITDA will end the year around $260 million. Fiscal 2015 is expected to be the start of the recovery in the business, pushed out from this year. Sell-side estimates call for EBITDA to rise to $367 million and then to $427 million in fiscal 2016. If true, the EV/EBITDA multiple will need to rise substantially to adjust for the new growth trajectory of the company.Clearly a 2.5x EV/EBITDA ratio is ridiculous for a company that has significant net cash on the balance sheet and appears to be making the correct moves to right the ship. Its main competition is trading at an average multiple closer to 8.0x, but they are growing. If Unisys can stabilize the business and start growing EBITDA in the back half of the year at a decent rate, we expect to see the ratio re-rate higher to around 4x. If the growth continues for all of 2015, then expect that ratio to re-rate closer to 5.5x or 6x by the end of the year.Using a 4.5x multiple and the sell-side's estimates for the company over the next two years, we came to the following estimates:(Source: Author's Calculation)Clearly, if the company is even moderately successful in its restructuring initiatives and can post even marginal growth in the back half of 2014 and into 2015, the stock should see a significant pop as many of the overhangs are likely to evaporate. As we noted above, the stock is trading based on interest rates due to the large, underfunded pension plan. As interest rates rise, the funding gap is likely to shrink rapidly. When that occurs, the stock will again be valued based on the fundamentals. We think this, coupled with the firm posting growth in their services business in the back half of the year, will cause the re-rating. An asymmetric opportunity emerges simply due to one of the larger acquisition or activism targets around. We think this provides limited downside while securing optionality to the upside.CatalystsThere are several important catalysts that will cause the re-rating of the shares.ConclusionWe think the company is poised to begin a recovery phase as the pension overhang appears to be reaching an inflection point lower. As the remaining investor overhangs have been removed, mainly the high debt levels and restructuring of the services line, the firm could return to growth as early as this quarter. However, the shares present significant optionality as they are a prime target for an acquirer or activist shareholder to get involved and prod management. The company is large enough for some of the small to medium activist hedge funds- Draper, Starboard, Trian, and Jana to name a few- to see the possibilities and get in at these low levels. We think the shares are currently priced based on the un-funded pension which, if you back out, shows a massively undervalued firm ripe for activism and a re-rating. The potential for activism or an acquisition could provide a decent floor to the shares."

On a constant currency basis, revenue declined 7%.Revenues in the United States declined 3% to $542 million as growth in the U.S. federal government business was offset by declines in its commercial business. International revenues declined 18% to $618 million.On a segment basis, revenues from the services department declined 13% year over year. Revenues from the technology department declined 4% year over year.Gross margin improved to 26.4% from 23.9% in the previous quarter and 22.2% in the year-ago quarter as the company benefited from improved cost efficiencies in services delivery and a stronger mix of high-end enterprise servers. Management also made significant reductions in selling, general, and administrative expenses to align the cost model with the market demand. Consequently, operating profit margin increased to 10.2%, compared with 2.9% recorded a year ago and 6.7% in the previous quarter.EPS came in at $1.48, easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 50 cents, primarily due to the reverse stock split.During the quarter, the company generated $94 million of cash. Capital expenditures in the third quarter declined to $48 million compared to $78 million in the year-ago quarter as the company continued to tightly focus its investments.As of Sept 30, 2009, Unisys had $474 million of cash and equivalents and total debt of $911 million. Unisys also had $1410.5 million of long-term post-retirement liabilities on its balance sheet.Earlier, in the quarter, Unisys successfully completed private offers to exchange unsecured senior notes for secured senior notes, cash and common stock. As a result of the exchange, Unisys reduced its long-term debt and cut its 2010 debt maturities to $66 million but increased shares outstanding to 42.3 million shares (adjusted for the reverse stock split).Last month, Unisys executed a reverse stock split of the company’s common stock at a ratio of 1:10. Management is currently engaged in a multi-step strategy of reducing costs and focusing resources on high growth areas of the IT market. Unisys is now expected to demonstrate tangible results from its ongoing restructuring, after several mistakes in execution in the past. Although management is making progress in expanding margins, we remain cautiously optimistic regarding the pace of IT spending recovery and the maturing of higher-margin legacy product sales and services.Our long-term recommendation for Unisys remains unchanged at Neutral, which means the company will perform roughly in line with the broader market.Based in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania Unisys is a worldwide information technology company."

Investment highlights follow:Company OverviewUnisys is an information technology pioneer with roots dating back 139 years. The company's predecessors, Burroughs and Sperry, were stalwarts of the mainframe era that merged in 1986 to form Unisys. Soon afterwards, however, the mainframe computer industry began a long-term decline. In response, Unisys began a shift toward high-end servers (such as Windows NT) and IT services. However, supporting and upgrading the company's mainframe platform, known as ClearPath, has remained a lucrative business. By the mid-1990s, services and solutions became the company's largest business. This would eventually form the core of Unisys' IT outsourcing and systems integration businesses.The period from 2000-2008 was a troubled period for Unisys. As its technology business shrank and even its services business stagnated, the company reported massive losses, which were further aggravated by the recession. In mid-2008, an activist investment firm named MMI Investments with over 9% of Unisys' shares was able to get two positions on the company's board of directors to clamor for changes, including the divestment of its government business. The CEO, Joe McGrath, was ousted in September 2008, and a new CEO, Ed Coleman, came to the helm.Coleman brought an impressive turnaround track record in the technology industry. Most recently as CEO of Gateway, he prepped that struggling PC maker for sale at a nice premium to Taiwan-based Acer. Before that, as CEO of the leading IT reseller Compucom, he oversaw that company's transformation from a product pusher to a services provider and then sold the company to a private equity firm. (As management consultants in the high tech industry, the writers of this article became familiar with Compucom's operations and its successful transformation).Coleman's tenure at Unisys began in October 2008 as the global economy was cratering, The market had left the company for dead, knocking the company's market cap down hard. The company announced cost reductions of over $200 million to staunch the cash burn, and indicated that it would concentrate its investments and resources in fewer, more profitable IT segments (later articulated as security, data center transformation, end user outsourcing, and application management).By mid-2009 signs emerged that the company's efforts had averted catastrophe and Unisys returned to slight profitability even as sales plunged. Amid the credit crisis, the company was forced to refinance its debts at loan-shark rates. The company also began a divestment program to raise cash and pay down debt, including the sale of its Medicare IT business to raise cash.In late 2010, the company formulated a business turnaround plan with the following goals:These were bold goals - to simultaneously improve profits and revenue, even while drastically de-leveraging the balance sheet. Not to mention a period of economic uncertainty and public sector austerity. But fast forward to today (mid-2012), and the company has achieved all of these goals ahead of time. The execution has been remarkable.The IncidentIn spite of the remarkable success of this turnaround, the market gives Unisys stock little respect. As mentioned above, the shares trade at merely 3 times the company's pretax profits. What is holding it back?Well, macro conditions are playing a part. About 40% of Unisys revenue comes from public sector customers. As governments in Europe undertake austerity measures and the US federal government stand-off points the country toward a ""fiscal cliff, there will no doubt be some turmoil. But at the end of the day, Unisys contracts are in non-discretionary areas. The company has achieved its turnaround goals in spite of winding down some big contracts such as the 2002 TSA deal which rolled off in 2010. Investor fear in this area seems overdone and should eventually subside.Also, the market is unfairly viewing Unisys as a stodgy relic from a bygone era. Admittedly, the company's flagship ClearPath mainframe platform is still a significant factor in its business. But Unisys has done a nice job of porting ClearPath to modern server technologies such as Java. The company expects ClearPath revenues to be stable (though lumpy quarter to quarter) over time. Today, more than 90% of Unisys revenues comes from other sources, such as IT outsourcing, systems integration and business process outsourcing which are growing at a nice clip. Unisys is also creating strong capabilities in crucial new areas such as security and data center.A more substantive overhang over Unisys shares is its legacy pension liability. While Unisys froze its pension plan years ago, it is still on the hook for vested beneficiaries and retirees. At the end of 2011, Unisys indicated its pension plans were underfunded by nearly $2 billion. At first glance this sounds really scary for a company with a current market cap of only $870 million. But as recently as 2008, Unisys' pensions were fully funded.To understand this, it is crucial to understand that the projected payouts to retirees have not actually changed. Instead, the discount rate at which the series of pension payouts is made has plunged as central banks in the US and Europe have embarked upon zero interest rate and quantitative easing policies which artificially suppress long term bond interest rates. The US 10-year Treasury yield is 1.5%. Pension regulations demand that pension liability calculations use these long term bond interest rates as factors for their pension liability discount rates.This accounting artifact has caused the ""present value"" of the pension payouts to explode over the past two years, even though the payouts themselves have not changed. (For this reason, we believe that Unisys stock is an excellent way to hedge against rising interest rates - it contains an embedded ""short"" of long-term bonds. Once interest rates normalize, the pension overhang vaporizes.) Management has stated for every 25 basis rise in their discount rates, ~$125 million of the pension overhang goes away. A 1.50% rise in rates eliminates a phantom liability equal to the current Unisys market capitalization.Of course, this effect cuts both ways. If interest rates actually decline further from their already microscopic levels, this phantom pension liability could increase due to the discount rate effect. While this would not fundamentally impair Unisys' intrinsic value, some may perceive this as a risk as rates could be volatile in the near term. However, value investors who believe, as we do, that long term interest rates will eventually rise, ought to ignore short term volatility (or better yet, exploit it).The ValuationGiven the pension overhang, how much is Unisys stock actually worth? Let's get back to basics and build a discounted cash flow model. As the baseline, let's make the following assumptions:(i) profit before taxes and pension contributions of $350 million (they currently exceed this on a TTM basis) is sustained, but does not grow(ii) pension contributions conform to the company's expected schedule under the current legislative environment, but we will conservatively assume there is a leftover annual payment of $170 million payment, forever(III) tax rate of 30% (this is conservative given the largely untapped NOLs)The resulting valuation of $35 per share is quite conservative. If long term interest rates increase, or Unisys refinances its debt at lower interest rates, or Unisys is able to better capture the value of its deferred tax assets, the value is much higher. If management pivots from a mode of fear-driven debt reductions and captures the potential value created through accretive share repurchases, the intrinsic value could exceed $60 per share.The CatalystsWhile we believe that value is its own catalyst, it is key to note that there are significant events that could re-price the stock up toward its intrinsic value:What takes Unisys to $35What takes Unisys to $60+KMF Investments may hold a position in the securities mentioned in this article.Disclosure: I am long UIS."
198781,21523,2010-04-14T17:18:10-04:00,,"Unisys (NYSE:UIS) is a technology products and services provider. The company operates through two units, which are simply called services and technology. Services is by far the largest unit, at over 80% of revenue. This group is further broken down into information technology outsourcing (ITO, 70% of the segment), and business process outsourcing (BPO). ITO consists of things such as systems integration, consulting, and management of customer's IT infrastructure. BPO is when customers outsource a particular function, such as payment processing or cargo management, to Unisys. Most of the company's clients here are in financial services.The technology group is product-oriented, marketing and selling ClearPath enterprise servers along with related operating system and middle-layer software. While this was traditionally Unisys' bread-and-butter, it now represents under 20% of sales and will continue to decline going forward. The bulk of legacy clients for technology products are in the public (government) sector.There is no denying that Unisys has an ugly financial history, and the balance sheet is still far from attractive. The company has delivered net losses in 6 of the last 10 years, and 4 of the past 5. Today, the balance sheet is still not that great. Cash balances are at $648 million, versus $911 million in total debt. Operating earnings only cover interest payments about 3.6 times over, below the 5 times minimum I like to see. And that is after major operational improvement in 2009. Looking at the past does not inspire much confidence here.However, it is the future we need to look at. After examining the results and considering the plan going forward, I actually believe Unisys looks like a classic turnaround story that is still under-appreciated by the market. Therefore, MagicDiligence has a solid positive (buy) rating on the stock, and it makes a good choice for your Magic Formula portfolio.The positives here are several. First is new management. J. Edward Coleman was installed as CEO in 2008, and he has a lot of experience in the field, including stints at Computer Sciences (CSC) and IBM (NYSE:IBM). Under Coleman's leadership, Unisys has been cutting costs by selling off low margin businesses, reducing headcount, moving hiring to lower cost countries, and focusing the company on 4 areas where they hope to build competitive strengths: security, data center outsourcing, end-user outsourcing, and applications outsourcing. In a nutshell, Unisys is moving from its historical reliance on hardware sales and into services, which are higher margin and ""stickier.""Early results have been solidly positive. Although revenues fell last year, operating margins improved drastically to 7.5%, causing operating earnings to increase more than 8 fold. Cash flow followed suit, allowing Unisys to pay down over $200 million in debt. Management is targeting 8-10% margins - still lower than premium players like IBM (who runs 13-15% op margins), but still a significant upside from current results. If they can accomplish this, the stock is very undervalued at a MFI-adjusted earnings yield of 16.5%.Can they do it? There is good reason to believe they can. For one, there is still potential for cost improvements. Most of Unisys' competitors have about 35-40% of their labor force overseas, while Unisys has just barely gotten to 20%. Moving more labor offshore will reduce costs. Unisys will continue to drop revenues as they divest older businesses, but the move towards services should greatly improve the predictability of year-to-year results, as most services contracts are long-term and carry high switching costs for the customer.Another thing we have going for us is the wide disparity in expected 2010 results for this lightly covered stock. Zacks forecasts 2.27 in earnings per share, and S&P comes in much higher at 3.26. My analysis tends to jive more closely with S&P - I see no reason Unisys cannot continue to produce good margins going forward. With those results, the balance sheet should continue to improve, which lowers interest costs and enterprise value, in turn improving both earnings and valuation.There are some additional risks here. IT outsourcing is intensely competitive, with big domestic players like IBM, large foreign firms like Infosys (NYSE:INFY), and smaller companies like Dell's (NYSE:DELL) Perot Systems. Unisys also has some very large pension liabilities, that are currently underfunded by about $1 billion. This could cause the company to commit some cash towards it in the next few years. Finally, Unisys has a poor history of implementing turnaround plans, and there is no guarantee this one will work either.While it is not a Top Buy candidate, Unisys still looks like a good turnaround play, and a fair choice for investors.Disclosure: No positions"
1100801,21863,2013-01-08T14:36:33-05:00,,"Global IT company Unisys (NYSE:UIS) has all the makings of a value stock. Its net  cash position of $330 million provides safety in the event of a downturn  and offers strong downside protection on the company's $760 million  market cap. In recent years, the company has managed annual income of  $200 million; it will not earn as much this year thanks to cutbacks in  government spending, but the company remains solidly profitable.Since a good portion of this company's revenues come from deficit-laden  governments (e.g., 17% of Unisys' 2011 revenue came from various agencies  of the U.S. federal government), one might expect this company to be  revenue-challenged going forward. But it appears as though the market  has overreacted to the pessimistic side, as Unisys trades at a P/E of 6  despite a healthy net cash position.But all is not what it appears to be. As per the company's notes to its  financial statements, the company's pension fund is a whopping $1.5  billion in the hole. This means it will take many years of  earnings to cover this shortfall, leaving shareholders little in the way  of returns, but a whole lot in the way of risks.Suddenly, the company's negative revenue outlook looms large, as fewer  dollars will be available to cover what will amount to large pension  expenses. In the next three years, the company will have to inject an  estimated $35 million, $100 million, and $170 million, respectively, into  its pension fund to meet its funding targets. If the company's pension  assets fail to meet their expected returns of 7%-plus (which is a high  probability considering current interest rates), expect these funding  requirements to be revised upward.This serves as a perfect example of why investors cannot rely solely on  screens to make investment decisions. A shrinking company with legacy  pension assets makes for a situation in which a considerable amount of the  company's profits must be diverted from shareholders. As such, Unisys  looks like a great company to have retired from, but not a great company  one should look to own considering these liabilities.Disclosure: No position."
216668,23899,2010-07-27T09:08:43-04:00,,"By Melvin PasternakThis could be a tough year for Unisys Corp (NYSE: UIS).  As a global information technology (IT) company, Unisys conducts IT outsourcing, systems integration and computer infrastructure maintenance for government agencies, commercial organizations and financial companies worldwide.  However, with the evolution of computer server and hardware technologies, demand for Unisys' legacy servers and IT hardware systems has fallen. And since there has been weakness in the overall IT market, many of Unisys' clients have cut their IT outsourcing and purchasing budgets.  As a result, Unisys has seen in a large drop in sales this year. In response, the company has been forced to make cuts to some operations, further impacting sales.  Unisys is scheduled to report second-quarter results on Tuesday. The outlook is unfavorable. Analysts expect both revenue and earnings to show declines.  Technically, UIS appears to be vulnerable and faces nearby resistance.    After hitting a low of $2.80 in March 2009, UIS entered a steep uptrend, surging to resistance near $16.40 the following month.  As the stock continued its ascent throughout 2009, a major uptrend line formed.  In both December 2009 and March 2010, UIS tested resistance near $40. That failure to penetrate resistance set up a potential double top, which the stock completed when it fell below $28.68 support on weak first-quarter results. During its fall, UIS broke the major uptrend line from its April 2009 high.  While UIS broke an intermediate downtrend line last Friday, it still faces stiff nearby resistance at current levels. Further resistance is in the mid-$25 range, the area of its mid-May recovery highs. A minor uptrend line drawn from the early July $17.04 low intersects the chart at $21.80.  Despite the recent rally, the stock is well below the falling 30-week moving average, which intersects at $30.07.  Important support dating back to March 2009 is near $17.  The indicators are mixed. MACD is on a sell signal. Although the MACD histogram appears to have crested, it remains in negative territory.  In December 2009, the major relative strength index uptrend was broken. It is now in a downtrend and falling. At 45.5, it is below the key 50 juncture, but not deeply oversold.  Indicative of the stock's weakness, stochastics appears to have found support in deeply oversold territory. Weak stocks can become and stay oversold for long periods of time. For the past three months, %K has leveled off near 19.8, while %D has remained near 12. Stochastics is currently close to giving a buy signal, but both %K and %D would need to surpass 20 to do so. However (as the dashed circles show) in the past when a buy signal was given, the stock's rallies were muted.  In addition to displaying technical vulnerability, Unisys also has a poor fundamental outlook.  In late April, the company reported disappointing first-quarter 2010 results that were below analysts' expectations. According to Thomson Reuters, analysts' expected the company to generate revenue of $1.1 billion, as it did in the first quarter of 2009. However, first-quarter 2010 revenue fell -9% to $998 million.  Analysts' project second-quarter revenue will fall nearly -10% to $1.0 billion, compared with $1.1 in the year-ago quarter.  As demand for UIS' products and services continues to drop, the outlook for the full 2010 year remains poor. Analysts expect revenue will fall more than -11% to $4.1 billion, compared with $4.6 in the full 2009 year.  The earnings forecast is also shaky.  In the first-quarter of 2010, Unisys' earnings fell -60% to $0.27 per share, compared with $0.66 in the first-quarter of 2009. In part, negative currency translation, especially of the Venezuelan bolivar, contributed to the large decline.  For the second quarter, analysts expect earnings to fall -47% to $0.53, compared with $1.00 in the year-ago quarter.  Three months ago, analysts projected full-year earnings of $2.27. These estimates have since been substantially reduced. Analysts now expect the company's earnings to fall to $1.47. This is at least a -69% drop compared with $4.75 in 2009.  In addition, the company is also richly valued, based on its 5-year expected price/earnings-to-growth ratio (price/earnings divided by earnings growth rate).  Unisys' 5-year PEG is 1.9. In comparison, competitor Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) has a 5-year PEG of 1.0. And International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM) has a PEG of 1.1. The closer the PEG to 1, the better the valuation.  Given that UIS is fundamentally weak and shows technical vulnerability, I would suggest that investors short the stock if it breaks the current minor uptrend line.Disclosure: Neither Melvin Pasternak nor StreetAuthority, LLC hold positions in any securities mentioned in this article."

The report is based on this nugget from Unisys’ annual report last month.Here’s what Unisys says in its annual report:Unisys is officially reviewing its options to repay $300 million in debt due March 2009. Unisys has been cutting jobs and expenses as clients pull back on spending, but it’s unclear whether it’ll be enough. In any case the debt markets aren’t thrilled with Unisys right now.

The bigger question: What happens to Unisys long-term? One portfolio manager calls Unisys a busted company. However, Unisys is a company with a bunch of lucrative government contracts.

Those contracts would look pretty good to an acquirer such as IBM (NYSE:IBM) or HP’s (NYSE:HPQ) EDS unit. Dell (NYSE:DELL) could also be a buyer if it wanted to make a services play.

(NYSE:UIS) is a top player in the information technology [IT] consulting business, providing such services as systems integration, network engineering, project management, and technical support.

Other practice groups focus on such sectors as communications, financial services, and transportation. The company also specializes in making high-end servers (under the ClearPath brand).
Unisys fell a long way from the heights of $49.70 in 1999.  It bottomed out last year at $4.70.  It's moving up again.  The question is: can it keep going or is this a little rally that will break investors' hearts and dent their pocketbooks?
There's reason to believe this could be the real thing.   Earnings have stopped being negative.  In 2005, they were in the red by 47 cents a share.  Then in 2006, they went deeper into it with a negative 81 cents a share.  But analysts are looking for 15 cents a share, positive, for this year and 45 cents a share next year.  In fact, they're predicting earnings will grow by 21% a year, on average, over the next 5 years while revenues only increase by 2.5% a year, on average, in the same time period.
Some of the early gains in those earnings will come from restructuring.&n!bsp; The company released 4900 employees last year.  It!39;s identified another 965 unnecessary positions in the services operation, and those people will be gone by the end of this year.  Those severances cost $32.7 million in pretax profits in the first quarter of the fiscal year and another $35 million will be taken in the second quarter when added to charges for consolidating certain operations.  To counter those costs, the company sold its media solutions business and has an income tax refund.  The restructuring should save the company about $360 million annually, starting in the first half of 2008.
While a small profit has shown up for the second quarter in a row, there are some concerns.  Service and technology orders were down in the first quarter.  However, outsourcing and infrastructure services increased revenues.  And, as with many technology companies, some orders slipped past the quarter's closing books, with the anticipation that they would happen in the next one.
The company is focusing its sales efforts on the top 500 U.S. companies and the ten most important foreign countries.  There's a new Intel based server, the ES7000, that the company believes will have a meaningful impact on revenues by the second half of this year.
Here are some more of the numbers: Debt is 101% of capital.  There is no equity, but it should return by end of the year to be 5 cents a share.  Current assets are about 1.2 times current liabilities.  There is no dividend.  Market cap is $3.2 billion.  Net profit margin is working toward 1% this year, to 2.6% next year.
Unisys has a chance to make some real money over the next several years.  Costs are down.  New products are being introduced.  It's worth most investors' time to look a little deeper.  But keep in mind that this is a very highly leveraged company with no room for errors if it's going to stay positive in its earnings and make them grow.  There's no capital cushion to soften any blows.

For the stock to work longer term, the company needs to realize cost savings from restructuring, stabilize its hardware business and gain traction in its services business, Goldman says. The firm’s price target on Unisys shares is $6.10, “suggesting 18% potential downside from current levels.” So here’s the thing: if they thought it was a short before, and not much has changed fundamentally, now they should REALLY like it as a short. No guts, no glory. Unisys shares today are up a cent at $7.41. UIS 1-yr chart:"

8945,20140,2006-04-11T07:31:14-04:00,,"When I was at Financial World Magazine, we would do a list of the ten worst managed companies in America. The cycle was about once a year. To make the list, a company had to do a lot wrong compared to the rest of the stock market and its peer group. The financial results would have to be very poor, and companies in industries that were down across the board were usually not included. For this tech list, a number of financial sources were consulted along with research from Wall Street and sources like ValueLine, Morningstar, and Investor's Business Daily. A good first look at Unisys Corp. (NYSE:UIS) can be done through two lenses: The first is the recent Wall Street Journal article on executive compensation. The survey looks at 350 very large companies for the 2004 and 2005 period. Of the 29 companies in the Technology section, Unisys shows by far the worst 1 year total shareholder return at -42.9% and ranks among the worst for 5 year return at -16.7. Both are substantially below the Technology Medians in the study. Then, turn for a moment to the Morningstar report on the company. There is an interesting chart on Unisys and its competitors showing sales compared to market capitalization. Unisys shows trailing twelve month sales of nearly $5.8 billion and a market cap of $2.3 billion. For the other companies which include IBM (NYSE:IBM), Sun (NASD:SUNW), EDS (NYSE:EDS), Accenture (NYSE:ACN), and Computer Sciences (NYSE:CSC), market cap and sales are much more closely aligned. In other words, the market discounts the Unisys revenue. In 1999, Unisys had revenue of $7.545 billion and operating income of $961 million. In 2005, revenue had dropped to $5.759 billion and the company had an operating loss of $162 million. The company's stock price was close to $15 two years ago. It now stands at $6.70. Unisys was once known as a large mainframe company. It is now, based on its own description in the business of supplying ""expertise in consulting, systems integration, outsourcing, infrastructure, and server technology to help clients achieve secure business operations"". The company is still in the high end server business but says that this sector is shrinking. On the balance sheet side of things, debt is up to $1.1 billion, far below the company's cash balance of $642.5 billion at year end 2005. Unisys is a company that got itself stuck between two closed doors, one in IT consulting and the other in high-end hardware. Given the size and strength of its competitors, neither is likely to open soon. UIS 1-yr Chart Douglas A. McIntyre is the former Editor-in-Chief and Publisher of Financial World Magazine.

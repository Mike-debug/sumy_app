4195602,103480,2018-08-07T02:23:00-04:00,"Ultimate Software continued its outperformance in Q2, with results beating analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line.Most notably, the company's 23% y/y growth in recurring revenues marked solid overachievement relative to the company's guidance for ""at least 20% y/y"" growth.Free cash flow in the first half of the year also grew 67% y/y, as Ultimate Software improves its operating margins.While no longer the growth stalwart that it used to be, Ultimate Software remains a profit-focused story with GAAP earnings up more than 3x year over year.","Precious few SaaS software companies have reached the age of maturity. By that, I mean most SaaS companies are still in their hyper-growth stages: with growth in the 30-40% range, an unpredictable revenue trend, and a focus on ""growth at all costs"" that prioritizes investments in sales headcount expansion rather than profitability.No doubt this is the right move for high-growth companies, within SaaS especially - landing recurring revenue deals that can provide steady income streams for multiple years is worth running at a loss in the near term. But over the past year, these high-growth SaaS companies have become immensely popular (and one could say, overvalued) in the markets, especially with the addition of overhyped IPOs like Avalara (AVLR), a sales tax compliance software company that shot up when the Supreme Court ruled unfavorably against Wayfair (NYSE:W) on the subject of sales taxes, or Zscaler (ZS), which pioneered a ""security-as-a-service"" model to cybersecurity. With the spotlight so squarely focused on these types of names, older SaaS companies that have gone through their growth phases and emerged as a slower-growing, yet more stable and more profitable company, have been largely ignored. Ultimate Software (ULTI) is an example of one of these old-school SaaS names that have been left in the dust. With its growth rate in the low 20s, Ultimate Software has largely moved out of the mainstream, which is a shame as its underlying fundamentals have never been stronger. The company just reported Q2 results that featured a respectable boost in recurring revenues. Earlier in the year, Ultimate Software guided to a ""minimum of 20% y/y"" growth in recurring revenues. This quarter, it posted recurring revenue growth three points above that guided minimum, at 23% y/y - and in addition, it upped its outlook to 23% y/y growth in recurring revenues. No, that's not as impressive as newer, smaller SaaS companies that are posting 40-50% y/y growth - but with Ultimate Software, what you're getting is a known quantity that has a proven track record for execution. Nor is Ultimate Software simply sitting still. It has turned to the standard playbook of larger software companies like Salesforce.com (CRM) and Oracle (ORCL): powering incremental growth through M&A. Ultimate Software just paid $300 million for a European HC company called PeopleDoc, paid in a mix of cash and stock ($75 million cash upfront, $50 million in one year, and the rest in Ultimate shares). Ultimate's Q3 guidance notes that PeopleDoc will contribute $5 million in recurring revenues in the third quarter, or about 2% of PeopleDoc's recurring revenue guidance range of $250-$252 million. Though not a cheap acquisition (if we annualize PeopleDoc's Q3 revenue guidance, we roughly calculate a purchase multiple of 15x recurring revenues), PeopleDoc can add two points of inorganic revenue growth to keep Ultimate Software's revenue growth from slipping into the teens.In addition, Ultimate's CEO has laid out a new long-term revenue target on the earnings call:A $2 billion revenue run rate is about 2x this year's revenue guidance of $1.138 billion, and represents a CAGR of 15% y/y over the next four years. Considering Ultimate has been steadily growing revenues at a 20% y/y pace for the past several years, this target should be easily achievable - perhaps even several quarters before 2022.Investors shouldn't overlook Ultimate Software just because it's a less flashy name now, relative to its higher-growth peers. Ultimate Software has become a bulwark of the HCM space, the second-most important pure-play HCM company behind Workday (WDAY) with a trove of recurring revenues. In my view, Ultimate Software is a long-term hold. Valuations have glided upward in the SaaS sector by several turns. By this, I mean that a ""typical"" SaaS valuation for a company growing at 30-40% y/y would be 7-8x forward revenues; now, with the influx of richly valued IPOs like Avalara, 9-12x forward revenues have become much more the norm. And for many IPOs like DocuSign (DOCU) and Zscaler, trading at a revenue multiple in the mid or high teens is also not unheard of. Ultimate Software, by contrast, has maintained a reasonable valuation multiple at 7x forward revenues. Yes, the company's lower growth merits its slight discount to the wider SaaS sector, but Ultimate Software also carries the added benefit of being one of the few SaaS companies to be profitable on a GAAP basis. And, like Dropbox (DBX), Ultimate Software generates respectable free cash flow margins.Though operating in entirely different segments of the SaaS sector, Dropbox presents an interesting comp. The company is currently trading at about 9.0x forward revenues, despite a growth rate that's only a few points higher than Ultimate Software - and like Ultimate Software, Dropbox also faces stiff competition from incumbents like Box (BOX) and Google Drive (GOOG). Ultimate Software's ~15% FCF margins in the first half of FY18 are lagging behind Dropbox's FCF margins in the mid-20s, but with FCF growth a top priority for Ultimate Software (FCF grew 67% y/y in the first half of 2018), it's catching up quickly.In my view, there's no reason Ultimate Software can't continue to rise to ~8-9x forward revenues, given how richly the SaaS sector is trading at the moment. For illustration's sake, Ultimate Software would need to hit $340 to attain a 9x EV/FY18 revenue multiple (based on FY18 revenue growth guidance of 21% y/y, as given by the company concurrently with Q2 earnings) and achieve an in-line valuation with Dropbox, or 20% higher than current levels.For several quarters now, Ultimate Software has posted stable revenue growth in the low-to-mid 20s. With a moderate M&A strategy behind it and a strong base of recurring revenues to rely on each year, it's fairly easy to bet that the company can continue to post ~20% y/y revenue growth for the foreseeable future.The focus now, in my opinion, is on improving Ultimate's margin and its free cash flows, even if top-line growth begins to decelerate. The company's most recent quarterly results show Ultimate doing just this. See the company's Q2 results below:Figure 1. Ultimate Software Q2 resultsSource: Ultimate Software investor relationsTotal revenues grew 21% y/y to $271.2 million, beating Wall Street expectations of $268.6 million (+19% y/y) by a respectable two points. Within this total revenue base, the most important revenue stream, recurring revenues, grew 23% y/y to $239.5 million. It's important to note the significance of Ultimate Software's high recurring revenue mix. In the first half of this year, Ultimate Software produced $476.0 million of recurring revenues, or 86.9% of its total. That's up 190bps from 85.0% in the year-ago period. This has huge implications both on growth and profitability. On the growth front, having such a high mix of recurring revenues means that the company can have a baseline revenue stream to start each year with, and new business becomes purely incremental. From a profitability perspective, the sinking mix of services revenue, which is performed at a loss (which can be seen above, with cost of services exceeding the revenue generated from it), contributes to a boost in Ultimate Software's gross margin, which has operated at a small deficit to peers like Workday for quite some time.Total gross margin this quarter, on a pro forma basis, came in at 64.5%, which the company claimed ""was also slightly better than we expected"" on the earnings call. What is more impressive, however, is the huge boost in Ultimate Software's operating income, driven by flat y/y sales and marketing expenses despite the boost in revenues. This indicates how ""mature"" software companies can benefit from large recurring revenue bases - it's no longer necessary to dole out huge gobs of cash to build large sales headcount, as renewal activities can support revenue growth at a lower cost. Operating income grew nearly 3x to $20.1 million, or an operating margin of 7.4%, versus just 3.1% in 2Q17.Ultimate Software warned that the PeopleDoc acquisition will initially come with some near-term margin dilution. Over the long run, however, the added recurring revenues should be folded in well into Ultimate Software's base at little incremental cost, and become long-term accretive to Ultimate's profits. Pro forma EPS in the quarter of $1.32 muscled past Wall Street expectations of $1.28, and as previously mentioned, free cash flow in the first half of the year totaled $77 million, growing 67% y/y and representing an FCF margin of 14%. It's unwise to use the allegory ""slow and steady wins the race"" with any technology company, as any association with the word ""slow"" is anathema to tech investors. But it's the closest phrase to describing the long-term bullish thesis behind Ultimate Software. The company has its bases covered on all fronts - it has stabilized growth in the mid-20s, is balancing profit margin increases alongside its growth, and has a top-ranked product that is consistently featured as one of the top HCM suites. In addition to that, Ultimate Software has a clean balance sheet with $200 million in cash and no debt, not to mention free cash flows coming in every quarter at a mid-teens margin - an enviable position from which to execute M&A.It should also be noted that Ultimate Software is exactly the kind of company that tech-focused private equity funds like Thoma Bravo are interested in buying - profitable and mature, with large recurring revenue bases. Though the news stream of software PE deals has died down of late, seeing a PE exit for Ultimate Software similar to Qlik's ~$3 billion purchase in 2016 wouldn't be implausible. Stay long on this name for the long term."
4238016,25120,2019-02-04T21:37:42-05:00,"Ultimate Software Group has been acquired in a huge $11 billion deal.Unlike many SaaS players, this company has operated relatively under the radar and has combined solid growth with a >$1 billion revenue run rate and real profits.The multiples look quite steep if you ask me, as I am congratulating all the long-term believers in Ultimate.","Ultimate Software Group (ULTI) had a pleasant surprise for its investors, as it announced that it has reached a merger agreement with Hellman & Friedman under which the company is sold for $331.50 per share in cash, representing an $11 billion valuation!The multiples look quite steep by all means, although Ultimate is a high-quality business. Therefore, congratulations to all the believers and holders of the shares, as the risk-reward for the new buyers does not look that compelling at these levels, at least to my eyes.Ultimate Software has reached a deal under which it will be sold to Hellman & Friedman at a price which matches the all-time high set in September of last year. This price action was, of course, followed by a fierce sell-off in technology-related names, including that of Ultimate, as shares fell to just $220 in December. Shares recovered to $275 per share in recent days and have jumped to the highs again following the news release of the deal.Hellman is very much interested in the provider of human capital management solutions which operates in the cloud. It is not just Hellman which is interested in the company, as it has partnered with other large investors as well, including Blackstone, GIC, CPPIB and other names. The deal does not just create a wealth transfer to shareholders but to all employees as well, as they too hold shares in the company.The deal marks an end to a great run which long-term investors in the firm have seen. Trading at just $10, even during the dotcom bubble, shares have gradually moved higher for a 30 times return in less than two decades, translating into very compelling returns by all means. To make an even better company and offer customers better service, Ultimate Software and management claim that being a private company allows for even quicker pace of innovation, while maintaining high service levels.Despite the steep premium, with the deal valuing Ultimate at 10 times the sales seen at little over $1.1 billion in 2018, the owners believe that value can be found, thanks to the leading HR and payroll solutions which already serve more than 5,000 companies and having records of nearly 50 million users.The consortium is confident that the deal will close, having granted the option to Ultimate for a go-shop period of 50 days in which the company and advisers can solicit higher offers for the business.The reason why the company is taken private is the promise of the business in the future, as current multiples are simply sky-high. On top of the current recurring revenue growth rate around 25%, with total revenues exceeding $1.1 billion in 2018, the company sees growth lasting, as it rolled out a $2 billion revenue target for 2021. With three years to go and a $1.1 billion revenue number for 2018, that suggests +20% growth for the coming three years to come.Unlike many other SaaS names, Ultimate is quite profitable, having posted real GAAP operating profits of $58 million in the first three quarters of the year on $836 million in total revenues. It goes without saying that with GAAP earnings power of >$2 per share, multiples are sky-high with net cash holdings just surpassing the $100 million mark, for a net cash position of little over $3 per share.So, based on the company's current earnings power, multiples cannot be rationalised. The promise is that $2 billion in revenues in 2021 can be achieved and the business becomes very profitable. Assuming 15% growth from 2021 to 2030 suggests revenues might grow to $7 billion. If the company can become really profitable and generate 30% GAAP margins, while working with a 20% tax rate, I see net earnings power of $1.7 billion, but this, of course, is a very ambitious outlook. Note that the earnings projection for 2030 is 50% larger than today's revenue base!If that is the case, and we do not account for retained earnings, while granting the company a generous 20 times net earnings multiple based on the established businesses which it might become, Ultimate might be worth $35 billion in 2030. With an $11 billion current deal value, that works down to a potential compounded annual growth rate of 11% per annum, without the impact of retained earnings or capital allocation decisions. This does not appear to be too high, as the new owners cannot really saddle the company with a lot of debt (just yet), since the earnings power of the business is rather modest.Not having covered Ultimate Software closely in the past, I can only congratulate management, employees and long-term believers in the company with the great trajectory seen in the past twenty years, now being ""closed"" with such a fantastic deal.It appears that the new owners clearly have a long-term view on the prospects of the business and believe that Ultimate Software will play a key role in human capital-related software solutions in the future, as current growth is expected to last for many years to come, while earnings should become a lot fatter.Based on my fairly aggressive assumptions through 2030, I ""only"" end up with potential gains of 11% per annum, as the risk-reward for the new buyers does not appear to be very compelling in my eyes, yet it has been a great ride for all those involved so far."
4217431,103480,2018-11-01T23:19:27-04:00,"Ultimate Software released strong Q3 results that eked out a small acceleration in top-line growth.The company beat Wall Street's estimates on both the top and bottom lines.In addition, the company has increased its recurring revenue mix to be nearly 90% of total revenues, greatly improving the company's revenue visibility and stability.Ultimate Software has also released a preliminary FY19 guidance view that indicates barely any deceleration from FY18.Against this revenue forecast, Ultimate has also noted it already has 94% visibility into next year's revenue pipeline.","In the October correction, mid-cap and large-cap technology stocks, especially those with positive bottom lines, have tended to do much better than their higher-growth, loss-bearing counterparts. Ultimate Software (ULTI), the Florida-based HCM company that is converging upon ~$10-billion market cap, is no exception to that rule. Its strong Q3 results, however, act as justification for the stock's steady performance. Software companies that have reached this scale are able to use their considerable scale and fantastic unit economics to turn large profit margins, as Ultimate Software is doing now.At Ultimate's current scale, the narrative is less about growth. Human capital management and payroll software, Ultimate's bread and butter, are no longer exactly growing categories in software. The HCM market has more or less settled, and while the major vendors are still jockeying for market share, the greenfield opportunities have more or less thinned out - most modern companies have already adopted their cloud-based HR platforms of choice. Against this lower-growth backdrop, however, Ultimate Software has excelled in maintaining high margins and growing its free cash flows, which are quickly becoming the new focal point for investors. And it's not like growth deceleration is affecting just Ultimate Software - even Workday (WDAY), the undisputed giant in HCM, gave investors a scare earlier this year when revenue growth dipped below 30%.In the third quarter, Ultimate Software's top line showed no deceleration from last quarter's growth rate - in fact, it managed to accelerate its growth rate by one point to 22% y/y. Alongside its earnings release, Ultimate has also unveiled preliminary FY19 guidance that assumes 20% y/y revenue growth in FY19. Recall that the company has only guided to 21% y/y growth in FY18. This guidance view for Ultimate is a strong indicator that the company will be able to maintain ~20% growth, or at least growth in the high teens, for an extended period of time as it still produces higher margins and expanding cash flows.Figure 1. Ultimate Software guidanceSource: Ultimate Software investor relationsRecall that last quarter, Ultimate's CEO set a long-term revenue target of $2 billion in revenues by 2022 - essentially doubling this company's revenue base over the next four years. In my view, I see no reason why the stock shouldn't also double along in stride, barring any execution issues that prevent Ultimate Software from reaching this goal. And for a company with such a high mix of recurring revenues (88% this quarter, up two points from the year-ago period), and elevated customer retention rates, execution issues should be rare. As long as Ultimate Software's stock price keeps pace with its revenue growth (i.e., its revenue multiple remains constant), this implies annualized gains of 15% each year.Ultimate is also starting off with a modest valuation. At its current post-Q3 share price of $267, the company has a market cap of $8.14 billion. Netting out $140 million of balance sheet cash leads to a revenue estimate of $8.0 billion. If we apply Ultimate Software's 20% y/y revenue growth estimate for FY19 against this year's expected revenues of $1.13 billion (which in turn represents 21% y/y growth over FY17), we arrive at a revenue estimate of $1.37 billion for FY19.ULTI data by YChartsThis puts Ultimate's current valuation at just 5.8x EV/FY19 revenues - which, in my view, is a steal for a high-margin SaaS company that is producing free cash flows and still growing in the ~20% range. It's also worth noting that, per CFO Felicia Alvaro's comments on the earnings call regarding guidance (replicated below), Ultimate already has visibility into 94% of its FY19 revenue - so its revenue forecast is terribly difficult to miss. Conversely, any new business signed in the next year provides upside.Thanks to the October selloff, Ultimate Software is down nearly 20% from highs (much better than many SaaS companies), putting the stock on temporary sale.Here's a look at Ultimate Software's full Q3 results:Figure 2. Ultimate Software 3Q18 resultsSource: Ultimate Software investor relationsRevenues grew 22% y/y to $287.8 million, accelerating one point over last quarter's 21% y/y growth rate and slightly beating Wall Street's expectations of $287.2 million. yes, it's true that this beat margin over analyst consensus is small - but this quarter, many technology companies (particularly large caps) have missed revenue estimates entirely for the first time in many quarters, so I'd much rather take a smaller beat.Scott Scherr, Ultimate's CEO, also called out strong attach rates for new customers in the quarter across Ultimate's various modules:Ultimate's platform approach gives the company a variety of revenue opportunities within its installed base - which, per Scherr's comments above, have extremely high win rates. It also helps Ultimate stay competitive as a one-stop shop against other vendors like Workday and Oracle HCM Cloud which have many modules packed under one roof. On the new business side, Ultimate also noted this quarter that Q3 was the best quarter ever for visits to Ultimate's website, as well as a 225% y/y increase in leads generated from Ultimate-led sales seminars. The company ended the quarter with more than 4,800 customers and more than 40 million employee records stored in its cloud.On the product front, Ultimate has also retained distinction as a top HCM platform - despite the existence of much larger competitors like Workday. In particular, Gartner, the leading software industry research firm, ranked Ultimate as a leader yet again in its annual Magic Quadrant for HCM Suites.There was only one sore spot in Ultimate Software's quarter: gross margins. Gross margins dropped 80bps this quarter to 61.6% on a GAAP basis, down from 62.4% in the year-ago quarter. With a margin profile in the low 60s, Ultimate Software already has a margin deficit to most SaaS peers, so this drop is particularly painful. Management attributed the drop to lower-than-expected recurring revenue margins, perhaps driven by the company's acquisition of PeopleDoc.Still, the company was able to drive both 7% operating income growth and a tripling of GAAP net income (driven, however, by tax changes). Pro forma EPS of $1.33 also beat Wall Street's expectations by a penny.Figure 3. Ultimate Software free cash flowsSource: Ultimate Software investor relationsAnd, as seen in the chart above, Ultimate Software has maintained an impressive rate of growth in cash flows. Operating cash flows are up 24% y/y to $172.2 million in the first nine months of FY18. After netting out $59.2 million of capex, the company has generated $113.0 million of FCF - up a strong 46% y/y.Ultimate Software is not the type of software stock that can double or halve in a matter of a mere month. While it's much less exciting than many of its high-growth peers, Ultimate Software offers the consistency and comfort that many investors cling to in turbulent market conditions. The FY19 revenue guidance that Ultimate Software released this quarter - as well as the 94% revenue visibility attached to it - validate that Ultimate Software is well on track to meet its four-year target of $2 billion in revenues. In my view, the stock price will rise in tandem - especially given how modestly valued it is today."
4118525,24157,2017-11-01T09:55:00-04:00,"To meet the expectations baked into its stock price, this firm must rapidly improve profitability while gaining significant market share.To date, this firm has shown few signs it has the ability to do both.The expectations baked into Ultimate Software Group’s stock price imply that the firm will reverse years of profit declines, more than double margins, and grow revenue at rapid rates.","To meet the expectations baked into its stock price, this firm must rapidly improve profitability while gaining significant market share. Achieving both at the same time is not impossible, but it is exceedingly difficult and rare. To date, this firm has shown few signs it has the ability to do both. The risk/reward proposition for investors looks unfavorable due to a combination of industry lagging profitability, alarming expense growth, poorly aligned executive compensation incentives, and high market-implied expectations for future profits. The Ultimate Software Group (ULTI) is this week’s Danger Zone pick.Since 2014, ULTI’s revenue has grown 24% compounded annually to $781 million in 2016 and $861 million over the last twelve months (TTM). Over the same time, its after-tax profit (NOPAT) has fallen 11% compounded annually to $31 million in 2016 and $16 million TTM, per Figure 1. The disconnect between revenue and profits comes from rapidly declining margins. The company’s NOPAT margin fell from 8% in 2014 to 3% TTM.Figure 1: ULTI’s NOPAT and Revenue Since 2014Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsDeclining margins and inefficient capital use have cratered ULTI’s return on invested capital (ROIC). ROIC has fallen from a once impressive 24% in 2014 to 7% TTM. At the same time, the company’s average invested capital turns have fallen from 5.2 in 2011 to 2.3 TTM. Further, the company has burned through $717 million (3% of market cap) in cumulative free cash flow over the past five years. The firm’s -$88 million in FCF over the last twelve months equate to a -2% FCF yield, which is well below the 2% average of the stocks in the S&P 500.The company’s $111 million in cash currently on the books would support the TTM cash burn rate for just over one year before the company would need a cash infusion via debt or dilutive share issuance.Ultimate Software Group’s executive compensation plan fails to properly align executives’ interests with shareholders’ interests. The misalignment drives the profit decline shown in Figure 1. Worse, the current compensation plan allows executives to earn large bonuses while shareholder value is destroyed. Executives’ cash bonuses are tied to the achievement of adjusted pre-tax operating income. This metric is conveniently adjusted to remove stock-based compensation and amortization charges.Long-term equity incentives are granted via time-based restricted stock awards, which lack specific performance-based criteria. The compensation committee reviews the executive’s long-term accomplishments, including revenue growth, profitability, cash flows, and customer retention. Unfortunately, this focus has not led to true value creation. ULTI’s economic earnings have fallen from $12 million in 2012 to -$4 million TTM.We’ve demonstrated through numerous case studies that ROIC, not revenue, customer retention, or non-GAAP metrics, is the primary driver of shareholder value creation. A recent white paper published by Ernst & Young also validates the importance of ROIC (see here: Getting ROIC Right) and the superiority of our data analytics. Without major changes to this compensation plan (e.g. emphasizing ROIC), investors should expect further value destruction.Ultimate Software is among a long list of firms that use non-GAAP metrics, such as non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP net income, to mask declining profitability. Our research digs deeper so our clients see through the illusory numbers. Below are some of the items Ultimate Software Group removes to calculate its non-GAAP net income:These adjustments have a large impact on the disparity between GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, and economic earnings. Over the TTM period and 2016, ULTI removed $132 million (over 340% of GAAP net income) and $114 million (over 376% of 2016 GAAP net income), respectively, in stock-based compensation expense to calculate non-GAAP net income. Combined with other adjustments, ULTI reported TTM non-GAAP net income of $103 million. Per Figure 2, GAAP net income was $38 million and economic earnings were -$4 million TTM.Figure 2: ULTI’s Misleading Non-GAAP MetricsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsUltimate Software Group’s business covers a wide range of employee life cycle services, beginning with recruitment and ending with retirement. Its standing within the Human Capital Management (HCM) market appears subject to the ability to compete largely on price. Competitors include Oracle (ORCL), with its PeopleSoft and Taleo products, Automatic Data Processing (ADP), Paychex (PAYX), Paycom (PAYC), SAP (NYSE:SAP), and Ceridian. The proliferation of software-as-a-service in recent years has spurred increased competition in the market.Per Figure 3, ULTI’s ROIC and NOPAT margin fall well below nearly all competitors/peers. In fact, the only firm with a lower margin is prior Danger Zone pick Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY). Prior to 2017, WDAY had fallen 16% (compared to S&P 500 +20%) since our Danger Zone report as losses only grew larger. However, shares have risen 59% this year after WDAY announced deals with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in early 2017. While the deals helped WDAY soar (though not improve profitability), they raise the competitive bar for other HCM providers by shrinking the pool of available clients.Ultimately, success in the HCM market is largely dependent on service functionality, product enhancements, and price. The firms with the highest profitability have greater flexibility to invest in research and development, effectively acquire new customers, and ultimately undercut competitors pricing if necessary. Firms with lower profitability, such as Ultimate Software Group, often lack the flexibility to compete effectively in crowded markets and lack the internal resources to develop market leading products.Figure 3: The Ultimate Software Group’s Profitability Ranks Near LastSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings In the world of software, cloud, and new technologies, “reaching scale” is often paramount to success. When a firm successfully scales the business, it is able to reach a critical mass where returns on incremental investments are high, and the business’ overall profitability improves. However, after nearly 30 years of operations, ULTI has yet to “reach scale.” At the end of 2016, ULTI reported it provided solutions to ~3,700 clients. For comparison, Automatic Data Processing reported it serves over 700,000 clients in its most recent 10-K, with its WorkForce Now platform serving over 60,000 mid-sized businesses.The more pressing matter for ULTI is that the firm is spending at unsustainable levels in its quest to reach scale. In order to compete and grow market share, ULTI has spent heavily on sales personnel and administrative operations. Per Figure 4, General and Administrative and Sales and Marketing costs have grown at nearly double the rate of revenue since 2014. G&A has grown 41% compounded annually, S&A has grown 38% compounded annually, and revenue has grown 24% compounded annually. With the significant growth in costs, any increase in revenue has been nullified as costs have eaten away at margins, as mentioned to earlier. Spending $2 to acquire $1 in revenue is not a winning strategy when there are numerous other competitors in the market that can easily afford to match pricing or discounts while remaining profitable.Figure 4: ULTI’s Expenses Outpacing Revenue GrowthSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings In addition, cost of revenue and research and development have grown at 21% compounded annually and 20% compounded annually, respectively. The growth in expenses creates a catch-22 for ULTI. The company must spend heavily to market and advertise its products and grow market share, which limits margin upside. However, cutting expenses to grow profits caps the company’s potential market share (estimated 6% of total addressable market). A firm can certainly choose between focusing on market share or profitability, and investors will overlook issues in the short term. Furthermore, the firm may be forced to choose one or the other as its need for capital draws near. The company’s $111 million in cash currently on the books would support its TTM cash burn rate for just over one year before the company would need a cash infusion via debt or dilutive share issuance.The larger issue arises when one looks at the valuation of ULTI and finds that the expectations embedded in the current share price imply both market share growth and increased profitability. Essentially, the expectations baked into Ultimate Software Group’s stock price imply that the firm will reverse years of profit declines, more than double margins, and grow revenue at rapid rates, as we’ll show below.ULTI has risen 87% over the past five years and 6% year to date while the S&P 500 has risen 79% and 14% over the same time frames. This performance has occurred despite NOPAT and ROIC declining. This move in the stock has widened the chasm between the company’s current financial performance and the significantly higher profits implied by the stock’s market value.Figure 5 shows ULTI and its peers compared on the basis of ROIC and enterprise value divided by invested capital (a cleaner version of price to book). As you can see, ROIC explains 67% of the changes in valuation for ULTI’s application software peers.Figure 5: ROIC Explains 59% of Valuation for the Systems Software MarketSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsULTI stands out as an outlier in Figure 5 and trades at a significant premium to its peers. If the stock were to trade a parity with the peer group, it would be $66/share – 66% below the current stock price. Given the firm’s deteriorating fundamentals, it should be clear ULTI does not deserve such a premium valuation.Our discounted cash flow model quantifies the expectations baked into that premium valuation. To justify its current price of $194/share, ULTI must immediately achieve 8% NOPAT margins (highest in company history, compared to 3% TTM) and grow NOPAT by 27% compounded annually for the next 13 years. This scenario seems overly optimistic, given the firm’s declining profitability in recent years. In this scenario, ULTI would be generating $8.3 billion in revenue, which would equate to 58% of currently addressable market and 37% of the expected market in the year 2022. It’s clear the expectations already baked into the stock price require ULTI to take significant market share, despite its lack of competitive advantage.Even if we assume ULTI can achieve a 5% NOPAT margin (average of last five years) and grow NOPAT by 20% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is still worth only $64/share today – a 67% downside.Each of these scenarios also assumes ULTI is able to grow revenue, NOPAT, and FCF without increasing working capital or investing in fixed assets. This assumption is unlikely but allows us to create optimistic scenarios that demonstrate just how high expectations embedded in the current valuation really are. For reference, ULTI’s invested capital has grown $62 million on average (8% of 2016 revenue) each year for the past five years.The largest risk to any bear thesis is what we call “stupid money risk,” which means an acquirer comes in and pays for ULTI at the current, or higher, share price despite the stock being overvalued. Large and more profitable competitors in the market make an acquisition less likely. Competitors would be better suited to use their competitive advantage to outprice ULTI rather than ignore prudent stewardship of capital and destroy substantial shareholder value in an acquisition.We show below how expensive ULTI remains even after assuming an acquirer can achieve significant synergies. Additionally, management would have preferred a sale already take place were one to occur. ULTI’s compensation committee has taken steps in recent years to lower the incentive for executives to sell the firm. In fact, in February 2017, the compensation committee terminated ULTI’s Change in Control Plan that would have provided cash payouts to named executives. Rather, the committee awarded restricted stock awards to unwind the CIC plan. In light of this change in compensation, we feel a sale of the firm is less likely.To begin, Ultimate Software Group has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest.After adjusting for these liabilities, we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, ULTI is worth less than its current share price.Figures 6 and 7 show what we think ADP should pay for ULTI to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. ADP could grow market share by purchasing ULTI and increase its enterprise business. However, there are limits on how much ADP would pay for ULTI to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT and free cash flows (or lack thereof) being acquired.Each implied price is based on a ""goal ROIC"" assuming different levels of revenue growth. In both scenarios, the estimated revenue growth rate is 20% in year one and two, which is the consensus estimate of revenue growth for the next two years. For the subsequent years, we use 20% in scenario one because it represents a continuation of next year’s expectations. We use 30% in scenario two because it assumes a merger with ADP would create revenue synergies through increased exposure to ADP’s large customer base.We conservatively assume that ULTI can grow ULTI’s revenue and NOPAT without spending anything on working capital or fixed assets beyond the original purchase price. We also assume ULTI immediately achieves an 8% NOPAT margin, which is the average of ADP’s and ULTI’s current NOPAT margin. For reference, ULTI’s TTM NOPAT margin is 3%, so this assumption implies immediate improvement and allows the creation of a truly best-case scenario.Figure 6: Implied Acquisition Prices for ADP To Achieve 7% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. Figure 6 shows the ""goal ROIC"" for ADP as its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) or 7%. Even if ULTI can grow revenue by 26% compounded annually with an 8% NOPAT margin for the next five years, the firm is worth less than its current price of $194/share. It’s worth noting that any deal that only achieves a 7% ROIC would be only value neutral and not accretive, as the return on the deal would equal ADP’s WACC.Figure 7: Implied Acquisition Prices for ADP To Achieve 25% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings. Figure 7 shows the next ""goal ROIC"" of 25%, which is ADP’s current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to ADP shareholders. Even in the best-case growth scenario, the most ADP should pay for ULTI is $25/share (87% downside to current valuation). Even assuming this best-case scenario, ADP would destroy over $5 billion by purchasing ULTI at its current valuation. Any scenario assuming less than 26% compound annual growth in revenue would result in further capital destruction for ADP.Expectations for ULTI’s earnings have been significantly cut following the most recent earnings release. In the release, ULTI lowered prior guidance for revenue growth and operating margin for the full year 2017, and the stock fell 12% the following day. The company blamed the lowered guidance on an increase in “time-to-live” times for its enterprise and mid-market offerings. Delayed deployment could be the result of any number of issues, but the most damaging result would be if clients leave for a competing service that can be deployed in shorter time.Despite the guidance cut, the company is still expecting upwards of 20% revenue growth and expectations remain high. As the market grows more competitive and ULTI’s customer acquisition costs continue rising, we believe margins will continue to be pressured, and an earnings miss may be on the horizon. Such a miss could send shares down to more rational levels. Apart from the 12% drop in August, shares also fell 6% in one day following 1Q17 earnings that missed revenue expectations.Apart from an earnings miss causing the market to send shares to a more rational level, investors carry significant dilution risk. As noted earlier, the current cash burn can only be sustained for just over one year. If the cash burn is not halted, ULTI will need a capital infusion through a dilutive secondary offering or debt issuance, which brings on investors with more senior claims to cash flows. In either event, current shareholders would see the value of their investment eroded, and ULTI could fall in accordance with this risk.While we don’t attempt to predict exactly when the market will recognize the disconnect between expectations and reality, we know the impact of failing to meet expectations can be highly negative.  Over the past six months, 26,000 insider shares have been purchased and 10,000 have been sold for a net effect of 16,000 insider shares purchases. These purchases represent less than 1% of shares outstanding.Short interest is currently 3.1 million shares, which equates to 10% of shares outstanding and over nine days to cover. There has been a significant jump in short interest this year, as the number of shares sold short has increased 72% since the end of 2016. Growing short interest would seem to imply we’re not the only ones who recognize the issues facing ULTI and its lofty valuation.Our Robo-Analyst technology enables us to perform forensic accounting with scale and provide the research needed to fulfill fiduciary duties. In order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and an accurate shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to The Ultimate Software Group’s 2016 10-K:Income Statement: we made $8 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing less than $1 million in non-operating expense (<1% of revenue). We removed $4 million related to non-operating expenses and $4 million related to non-operating income. See all the adjustments made to ULTI’s income statement here.Balance Sheet: we made $263 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $133 million. The most notable adjustment was $79 million (18% of reported net assets) related to deferred tax assets. See all adjustments to ULTI’s balance sheet here.Valuation: we made $169 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $33 million. The largest adjustment to shareholder value was $62 million in total debt, which includes $52 million in off-balance sheet operating leases. This lease adjustment represents less than 1% of ULTI’s market cap.The following funds receive our Unattractive-or-worse rating and allocate significantly to The Ultimate Software Group.This article originally published on October 23, 2017.Disclosure: David Trainer, Kyle Guske II, and Kenneth James receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme.[1] Ernst & Young’s recent white paper, “Getting ROIC Right”, proves the superiority of our research and analytics."
4155087,104119,2018-03-09T13:22:12-05:00,"ULTI is not particularly profitable. It is dilutive. It doesn't beat the risk-free rate. And it is trading at a significant premium.ULTI's current P/E - 564 - trades at a significant premium to both market averages as well as its own historical multiples.Worse, there is significant optimism embedded in ULTI's shares. With a forward P/E of 46, ULTI has a price-implied one-year earnings growth expectation of over 1202%.If its earnings yield is significantly less than the risk-free rate, in my opinion, it's not worth the excess risk of its shares.","The Ultimate Software Group (ULTI) is a company offering web-based payroll and workforce management software. It is a company that's not particularly profitable. It is a company that is dilutive. It is a company trading at a significant premium. Finally, looking at its price-implied earnings growth assumption, it is a company with a significant amount of optimism embedded into its price.With an earnings yield that doesn't beat the risk-free rate, in my opinion, investors would do well to avoid it.First, let's talk about dilution.ULTI has diluted its shares significantly, diluting shareholders over 25% in the last decade alone.Source: YChartsAs my readers know, one of the first things I look at when I analyze a company is its history of share dilution. When a company issues additional shares, an existing investor's ownership stake in the company is reduced. This harms investor returns and should be avoided.To demonstrate how dilution harms returns, I'll use the following thought experiment.1. I'll assume that the next ten years resemble the last ten years, and ULTI increases its share count by 25%. 2. I'll assume ULTI manages to double its revenue in that same period.Even with that revenue growth, because it diluted its shares, shareholder return would be muted. To demonstrate just how much, let's assume you buy 100 shares of ULTI today at ~$54 when it has 30.57m shares outstanding.Source: Author's CompilationAs I said, we'll assume that over the next ten years ULTI doubles its revenue. And, let's say, that because ULTI investors love to reward revenue and nothing else, the stock price reflects that. Your risk has paid off!But ULTI has issued 25% more shares, so now there are over 38m shares outstanding.Source: Author's WorkHolding all else constant: instead of your shares being worth $108 per share, because of the dilution, they're now worth a little over $86 per share. Even though the company doubled its revenue, revenue per share has increased from $30 to only $49, instead of $61. Instead of your share of ownership being worth $10.8k, even though you made the correct directional call, now, simply because of management's decision to dilute those shares, they're only worth $8.6k.A valuation increase doesn't guarantee a share increase if management dilutes them. Instead, because of its dilution, your return is muted.The situation is worse when we consider its poor earnings history.While ULTI has enjoyed consistent sales growth over the decade, its earnings are not keeping pace. Indeed, net income is at around the same level that it was at in the early 2000s.Source: YChartsIn fact, its revenue and net income are actually negatively correlated, demonstrated in the correlation analysis in the chart above. It's hard to see how ULTI will grow its profits in the future if the sales growth above doesn't lead to similar earnings growth. Without some significant operational cutbacks, ULTI may not be able to improve its bottom line.This failure to grow its bottom line is worse when we consider that it diluted its shares by over 100% over that period.In the above, I've focused on the quality of the company - its profitability and its dilution. But reviewing the quality of the company is only half the battle. We also need to review the quality of the stock.Given the quality of the company as discussed above, investors like myself might expect ULTI to trade at a discount.We'd be wrong.ULTI's current P/E - 564 - trades at a significant premium to both market averages as well as its own historical multiples. For market averages, the Kansas City Fed finds, high P/Es have negative consequences for shareholder returns (emphasis added):That means that ULTI trades at over 15x historical market averages even at its highest (36). Further, it's trading at more than double its 5-year historical P/E.Source: MorningstarWorse, with a forward P/E of ~46.92, ULTI has a price-implied one-year earnings growth expectation of 1202%. In my opinion, that means that there is simply too much optimism embedded in its shares.Finally, ULTI's EV/EBIT is 170.29. If we take the reciprocal of this, I get an earnings yield of just 0.58%. Compare that 58 basis points with the 225 basis points provided by a two-year t-bill. With an earnings yield less than the risk-free rate, in my opinion, it's not worth the excess risk of its shares.I caution investors against buying shares of ULTI. Even assuming ten years of excellent price-linked revenue growth, an investor's reward may very well be muted if it continues diluting its shareholder base. It is a company that's diluting its shares; it is a company that has failed to translate sales growth into bottom line growth; it is a company trading at a significant premium, with a significant amount of optimism embedded in the price of its shares. Further, its earnings yield doesn't come close to beating the risk-free rate.For certain companies - let's say, a brand new biotech, I might be willing to consider paying an earnings premium. In the case of ULTI, I would not suggest investors take on that risk."
4176073,103480,2018-05-22T04:59:53-04:00,"Ultimate Software's Q1 results showed a company that is still able to produce >20% y/y revenue growth.Guidance calls for 17% y/y total revenue growth and 20% y/y recurring revenue growth, with further opportunity for upside as Ultimate Software guides to minimum growth rates.On top of that, Ultimate Software grew operating cash flows by 22% y/y in Q1, benefiting tremendously from improved operating margins.Shares might not be cheap relative to the broader SaaS industry, but Ultimate Software is reasonably priced against other HCM comps, especially Workday.","Human capital management software, or HCM, is a tough space to be in. There are plenty of competitors and everyone is claiming to do something different, whereas the core functionality of all HCM platforms (at least from the point of view of an HR officer) is fairly simple: employee records, payroll, benefits, onboarding, time management, and the like. What differentiates them all, beyond a matter of preference for the user interface? Gartner, the leading independent analyst for the software industry, has forecasted a ~10% growth rate for HCM vendors through 2021 - by all measures, that's a fairly strong growth rate. And while many of the pure-play SaaS HCM companies in the market are still growing in excess of that, we've seen deceleration start to bake into their results.Ultimate Software (ULTI), over the past several years, has become one of the top powerhouse vendors in HCM, at least among the pure-play names (aka, software vendors focused on HCM, not huge portfolio companies like SAP (SAP) that offer HCM along with ERP, CRM, and dozens of other applications). Its recent Q1 results show a company that has been able to defy the deceleration trend for several years. Ultimate Software's growth has hovered reliably in the ~20% range since 2014, without any meaningful spikes up or down. This is a company that has clearly found its niche serving mid-market enterprises (much like Netsuite's finance and ERP software catered well to mid-market customers, before it was merged with Oracle's enterprise-facing ERP features in a pricey 2016 acquisition).The stock has shrugged off a slew of downgrades from analysts over the past month, most of whom cite valuation as the primary concern. In my view, however, Ultimate Software is hardly overpriced. The elephant in the room here is Workday (WDAY), the dominant HCM software company that has perennially traded at double-digit revenue multiples. Of course, Workday is also growing at a ~30% rate despite being at about twice Ultimate Software's size - but still, the valuation gap between the two companies is quite apparent:ULTI EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsGiven that Workday trades four turns above Ultimate Software on a revenue basis, I'd say there's plenty of room for Ultimate Software to march higher, even after considering its impressive year-to-date rally. One caveat here: Ultimate Software's gross margins are lower than Workday's (62.4% gross margin for Ultimate Software in FY18 versus 70.6% for Workday), as it has a greater portion of its revenue mix in professional services that are done essentially at cost. That means Ultimate Software's revenue stream is slightly less valuable than Workday's.Ultimate Software's guidance, however, points its growth trajectory in the right direction, with FY18 revenue forecasted to grow ""in excess of 17%"" while FY18 recurring revenues (aka, non-professional services) are forecasted to grow ""in excess of 20%"". Note that Ultimate Software's way of guiding revenues, setting a minimum growth rate, is quite a novelty compared to most software companies that give a simple dollar range. In any case, the more robust growth rate for non-recurring revenues means that Ultimate Software is working to grow its SaaS revenue mix, and thus its gross margin, over time. In addition to the revenue piece, there's also a lot to be said about Ultimate Software becoming a cash flow/earnings story. The company has been profitable on a GAAP basis for quite some time, but it's also close to having is operating cash flows support its valuation. As also shown in the comparative chart above, Ultimate Software's valuation at ~30x OCF is still rather steep, but still much better than approximately double that valuation at Workday. And with OCF growth outstripping revenue growth on top of vastly improved operating margins, a reasonable cash flow-based valuation for Ultimate Software is coming in the near horizon.The bottom line on Ultimate Software's stock: it's certainly not cheap, but relative to other HCM names (in particular Workday) as well as other high-growth SaaS stocks, Ultimate Software does look appealing. The emergence of significant cash flows is another major bull catalyst to look out for. I'd use any Wall Street-induced pullback or other negative noise to build a position as Ultimate Software gets ready to run higher.Let's take a look at the company's Q1 results:Figure 1. Ultimate Software Q1 earningsSource: Ultimate Software investor relationsRevenues grew 21.1% y/y to $276.8 million, actually accelerating 120bps over the company's exiting Q4 growth rate of 19.9%. The fact that Ultimate Software was able to clock in >20% growth allows it to surpass a psychologically important threshold, as many analysts and investors are baking into their models a deceleration into the high teens (certainly, Ultimate's own FY18 guidance calls for 17% growth). However, with the outperformance in this quarter, we can easily see full-year growth land in excess of 20%, especially if revenues continue to accelerate. Note also that Wall Street only expected revenues of $270.7 million in the quarter, or 18.4% y/y growth, putting Q1's results at a respectable 250bps upside to consensus expectations.Recurring revenues - essentially the revenue derived from SaaS, and the most important focus for the company - showed even stronger growth of 24.5% y/y in the quarter. As a percentage of total revenues, recurring revenues represented 85.5% in Q1, a significant improvement over 83.1% in 1Q17 - and as the company is continuing to forecast recurring revenue growth in excess of total revenue growth, the mix will continue to shift in the right direction. Mitchell Dauerman, the company's outgoing CFO (Felicia Alvaro, the company's VP of Finance and a 20-year veteran of the company, succeeded him), attributed the outperformance to the following:Primarily due to this favorable mix shift into SaaS, Ultimate Software saw a 140bps boost to gross margin, posting 62.1% gross margins in the quarter versus 60.7% in 1Q17. Given that investors have been particularly picky on gross margin this quarter in the tech sector, and that Ultimate's gross margin is already lower than the majority of its peer set, continued gross margin expansions will be key to the bull story.Operating margins, however, saw even more robust improvement, driven primarily by Ultimate ratcheting down sales and marketing costs to 26% of revenues, versus 30% in the year-ago period:Figure 2. Ultimate Software operating margin expansionSource: Ultimate Software investor relationsRolling it all into the bottom line, Ultimate Software posted pro forma EPS of $1.30, or 11% upside to analyst expectations of $1.13. And of course, this came on top of the cash flow growth that we're anticipating so heavily from the company. Operating cash flows grew 22% y/y to $56.6 million, while free cash flows showed 43% y/y growth to $33.7 million. Ultimate Software has achieved a strong rally this year already, rising approximately 20% and widely beating out the broader market, but it's for good reason. The company has consistently been able to post earnings beats while not sacrificing its ability to expand margins and grow cash flow.ULTI data by YChartsWith so few SaaS companies showing positive free cash flow and GAAP net income, Ultimate Software is already in a rarefied category in the software sector - and unlike its primary rival Workday, it doesn't trade at an absurd valuation. Continue to monitor shares of Ultimate Workday for a well-timed buy point."
4096466,80135,2017-08-08T16:09:42-04:00,"Despite earnings beat, the stock tanked.Revenue growth is being offset by high OPEX growth.HCM is crowded with quality players, margins will remain under pressure.Valuation and heavy stock based compensation are some of the serious red flags.","Despite consistent revenue growth, Ultimate (NASDAQ:ULTI) is a short candidate. Reasons include intense competition from quality players, high-cost structure that eliminates economies of scale and reliance on stock compensation to avoid negative cash flows. Valuation concerns add consolidate the short thesis as the company trades at quite a premium. Growth is priced expensively. Even a little slip with respect to earnings guidance will hurt the stock in future as it did during Q2 2017.This is a follow up piece to the PRO initiation on ULTI. Ultimate Software (ULTI), a human capital management company, recently reported the results of its second quarter of 2017 beating earnings consensus while missing on the top line forecast.The company reported revenue of $224.7 million, up 20.5% on a year over year basis. Analysts were modeling for a revenue figure of $221. 4 million. Earnings came ahead of consensus as the company reported an EPS of $0.93, beating the consensus by $0.02. Earnings grew around 22% on a non-GAAP basis. However, on a GAAP basis, earnings declined by around 20%.For the third quarter, the company is guiding for mid-point revenue of $233 million, which is slightly ahead of the consensus of$232.86 million. For the full-year 2017, Ultimate Software expects the revenue to increase 20% Y/Y.Despite growth, the market didn’t take the earnings news quite well and the stock fell around 11% during after hours.During the first half, revenue of the company reached $385.1 million, an increase on ~23% on a year-over-year basis. The growth was primarily supported by increasing adoption of the company’s cloud offering. Recurring revenue from cloud offerings grew 23% during the most recent quarter.Note that recurring revenue makes around 87% of the company’s total revenue. New product offerings including UltiPro learning and UltiPro Perception also contributed to the revenue boost for the quarter.During the first half of 2017, non-GAAP earnings reached (pdf) $1.68 a share, translating into an increase of 13.5% on a year-over-year basis. However, non-GAAP earnings growth was fueled by the exclusion of non-cash compensation expenses and non-cash amortization of intangibles. Accounting for these expenses, in fact, demonstrate a decline in EPS to the tune of 4.7% on a year-over-year basis.The company aggressively uses stock-based compensation to avoid negative cash flows. However, the effect of this strategy will turn up elsewhere, probably in the form of dilution. Stock-based compensation was at a whopping $73.144 million during the first half of 2017 making up around 16% of the company’s total revenue.It’s clear that company is using stock based compensations and non-GAAP measures to highlight its earnings, which affects the stock price.The Positives1. Ultimate Software is demonstrating high double-digit growth in its revenue.23% growth during the first half along with management’s guidance for 20% growth for the full-year 2017 bodes well for the company. Retention rate was 96% during the trailing 12 months indicating that the company will be able to sustain its revenue base going forward. The company is also witnessing a strong gross profit growth as it was in line with the revenue growth during the first half of 2017.2. Some of industry watchers cite Ultimate Software as a leader in the HCM space.Nucleus research puts Ultimate software in its leader quadrant for HCM value Matrix 2016. Ultimate has improved a lot since 2014 according the Nucleus Value Matrix.Source: Nucleus ResearchSource: The Ultimate Software Or The Ultimate Short, Focus Equity, Seeking AlphaIt can be seen that Ultimate Software has moved past many leaders including Success Factor in terms of functionality and usability. This improvement will allow the company to maintain its top line growth going forward.1. Large disconnect between non-GAAP and GAAP operating margin indicates that the company relied heavily on non-cash stock compensations for its operations.During the first half of 2017, operating margin fell to 2.2% compared to 4.8% during the same period last year. Non-GAAP operating income margin also declined to reach 18.7% compared to 19.6% on a year-over-year basis. Analysts normally bank on non-GAAP earnings to gauge a company’s performance. With such a high proportion of stock-based compensation, non-GAAP might not be a good idea to value Ultimate Software.2. Ultimate’s business depends on aggressive marketing, which leads to high OPEX.Scale should create economies of scale – right? It’s not the case for Ultimate Software. Operating expenses are growing at a higher rate compared to revenue growth. Operating expenses grew at 27.3% during the first half of 2017 while revenue grew at 23.8%. This has been true for a long time. During the first half of 2015, revenue increased 20% while sales and marketing and G&A expenses increased 37% and 54%, respectively.3. Competition is intenseThe market is already crowded with big players including SAP’s (SAP) Success Factor, Oracle’s (ORCL) Taleo, Workday (WDAY) and Cerdian. See the competition table below: Source: Nucleus Research, Gartner and G2 CrowdThe market is crowded, and not just with subpar solutions. The table above shows that there are several companies that offer competitive solutions. Therefore, the business requires high marketing and admin expenses in order to push product sales. It is worth mentioning that Ultimate Software isn’t even in the leader Quadrant of Gartner’s Magic quadrant for Cloud HCM suites for mid market and large enterprises. G2 crowd grid puts UltiPro in the leader’s quadrant of HR Management Suites, but the company lags behind ADP (ADP) and PeopleSoft in terms of market presence.Source: G2 CrowdOverall, high OPEX structure will persist given the competition and the fact that Ultimate Software, arguably, isn’t the only one to offer best-in-class solutions. 4. Delay in deployment can hurt the company’s top line.Ultimate Software pointed out in its earnings report that time-to-live period has expanded by 2 to 3 months for enterprise sales and 1 to 2 months for mid-market sales. This indicates that the company is either facing deployment issues, or it’s resource constrained.In any case, delay in revenue doesn’t bode well for the company. Ultimate Software claims that it’s just a timing issue and won’t affect recurring revenue. As a matter of fact, it can. Cloud customers are usually sensitive to deployment times, or time-to-live, because this can affect their sales too. The point is that extension in time-to-live isn’t good for Ultimate’s revenue growth.1. Ultimate Software trades at a forward PE of around 44 based on 2018 earnings.And this is assuming the company will be able to grow its earnings by 27% during 2018. The fact the company increased its non-GAAP earnings by 13.5% during the first half of 2017 makes a 27% increase in earnings during 2018 a difficult task. Not to mention, all these earnings estimates are non-GAAP, and the company struggles to achieve GAAP earnings growth.Even if Ultimate Software manages to reach 27% growth during 2018, a multiple of 44 isn’t justified as growth of 20% p.a. is expected during the next five years. This puts the PEG at more than 2 making ULTI an expensive growth stock.2. Economic value added approach to valuation also paints a negative picture.If the company manages to meet rosy analyst estimates alongside growing its EPS by 20% during 2018-2022, the stock should be priced around $140. Terminal growth is assumed to be 3%, which is a generous assumption by any standard. Other assumptions include:Cost of capital is expected to grow in line with earnings growth. CAPM is used to drive the cost of equity.Focus Equity EstimatesValuation sheet reveals a downside around 35% based on current stock price. It is vital to note that all these calculation feature non-GAAP earnings reported by Ultimate Software. Things would seem quite not as good if GAAP earnings are used for valuation.The point being, aggressive non-cash compensation should be viewed with caution in Ultimate’s case as dilution in the future can materially hurt the reported EPS of the company.Human capital management industry is on the rise as evident from Ultimate Software’s top line growth. See a detailed industry analysis here. The company has been posting consistent double-digit revenue growth. It also has decent products to offer.However, high operating costs amid stiff competition will continue take a toll out of the company’s bottom line. Earnings growth will remain under pressure due to higher rate of OPEX growth. As a result 20% p.a. earnings growth during the next five years seems like a difficult task.Moreover, valuation based on this 20% earnings growth reveals significant downside. Despite decent earnings, the stock tanked. That was primarily due to valuation concerns, we believe. The bottom line is that Ultimate Software remains a good short candidate."
3930616,58671,2016-02-25T14:44:19-05:00,"My Top Shorts in the Software as a Service (SaaS) space are: ULTI, ATHN, PCTY, ELLI, HSTM, CSOD and TEAM.After years of rampant overvaluation, the market may actually start valuing SaaS companies by the underlying fundamentals.There is still tons of opportunity for you to short these stocks or exit if you were crazy enough to own them.","Software as a Service or ""SaaS"" (pronounced /sæs/, like as in Sassy) has enjoyed a really good ride over the last five years. It became pretty obvious a few years back that investors had bought into the business model and the idea Marc Andreessen presented in his 2011 WSJ article, Software was Eating the World.Since that article SaaS companies have become the coolest thing since sliced bread. Both the private and public markets went crazy to own this next leg of computing that was poised to overtake some much of our personal and business activities. These SaaS companies were the real deal that we were waiting for since the Tech Bubble of 2001, when we were given Webvan.com and Pets.com, not salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY).These new SaaS companies were defensible businesses with essentially limitless and constant growth prospects (or you were told). The economics of these businesses were underpinned by the ""SaaS"" business model. What is the SaaS business model you ask, it basically means instead of having companies pay a one-time licensing fee every year or few years, they pay a subscription fee every month, which includes previously outsourced support services. Pretty ingenious right? Billions of dollars of value created right there. Honestly, it all made sense. The argument was (and is still sound) that software was in fact starting to take over world. The problem is the business model that most software companies decided to use was not wildly understood or easily evaluated.The SaaS Model ExplainedThe Saas Model came with wild excitement, some confusion and lots of criticism. There is a great presentation from Matrix Partners that explains the SaaS model and how it works. Matrix Partners also gave a good update to that model here. In it they state the basis equation to measure the long-term value (LTV) of a customer on a SaaS platform.LTV = ARPU x Average Lifetime of a Customer - the Cost to Serve them (COGS)Average Lifetime of a Customer = 1/Churn RateARPU = Average Revenue Per UserCOGS = Total cost of Sales & Marketing / No of Deals closedPretty simple right? We will come back to the model as it will highlight my points about churn, competition and COGs later.The faster you grow in a SaaS model the more cash flow negative you become upfront as you invest to onboard new customers, called customer acquisition costs (part of COGs), which are front-loaded. These costs are offset by the lifetime value of the customer. This imbalance is suppose to flip back when revenue growth slows to a more reasonable pace around 15-25%. At that point all of the investment you put into the software, sales, marketing and onboarding is supposed to yield fruit in the form of positive cash flow. The problem is, until the company slows its growth rate it is very hard to tell if their customer acquisition costs were lower or higher than the lifetime value of the customer. There is also the issue of high churn rates (churn being customers canceling your service).In the SaaS model if you are not growing you must be dying or you better start producing a lot of cash flow. If you are a SaaS company you need to be growing fast initially, usually above 35% revenues per year. That was the world of SaaS companies for the last five years - very high revenue and bookings growth rates and no earnings or positive cash flows. So what happens when the revenue growth rates slow like they are currently doing? These SaaS companies are supposed to yield huge amounts of free cash flow, unless of course their customer acquisition costs are greater than the lifetime value of those customers, their churn is too high or their customer retention costs are higher than originally thought.Potential Issues That Can Occur With A SaaS ModelThere are a few things that could go wrong with this SaaS model that I will try to lay out as possible reasons why many of these SaaS companies are worth significantly less than the market currently values them. Most of them have a combination of the following problems.1) Customer acquisition and customer retention costs are higher than lifetime value of customers. If you spend too much on sales and marketing up front you can destroy value over the long term. It doesn't mater how fast you are growing, you simply can't outrun your COGs, especially when you have a bloated sales organization that is required to retain customer relationships. Spending too much on sales and marketing may be a direct result of competition.2) Competition. It turns out all of these SaaS companies are competing with each other for customers. Some of them will win and some of them will lose, which is how capitalism works. When the losers realize they are the losers it turns out no one else will, as its very hard to actually determine if their customer acquisition costs are higher then their LTV. So what do the losers do? They drop their ARPU to win new business to keep their revenue growth rate high, which in turn hides the fact that they are the loser. This causes the winners harm too, as it drags down their ARPU to compete with the losers. The losers and winners are both cashing out like crazy through insider sales and share-based compensation along the way, so they don't really care if they spend to much on sales and marketing as long as they keep their growth rates high.3) Churn. Churn is probably the most important metric to understanding if a SaaS company is delivering on their LTV. As the higher the churn the lower the LTV. That is exactly why most SaaS companies do not publicly disclose their churn rates.4) Share-based compensation is a real expense to investors. All of the SaaS companies give lots of their own stock to their employees through share-based compensation. It is a non-cash item so it is free for them and they can exclude it when the calculate their ""Non-GAAP"" earnings or EBITDA. For investors share-based compensation is a real expense as it continually dilutes shares.5) Number of deals closed slows, which balloons the COGs. As revenue growth slows so do the number of deals closed. So the new customer base to spread bloated COGs onto becomes smaller making it hard to be profitable on new customers. Companies with slowing revenues should cut sales and marketing costs to support this slowing pace, but most don't. Customer retention costs are a cost usually not talked about a lot in SaaS, but in any other mature sales business are important. As SaaS matures this cost will become real for companies that don't want their churn rates to go up.My top short ideas that use a SaaS modelI picked out my top short ideas that use a SaaS model either entirely or partially. I tend to like the companies I believe are the losers that are tying to hide the fact that they are the losers. But I also believe some of the winners are just completely overvalued and will eventually revalue to more reasonable valuations.Human Resource Management (HRM) Systems: When it comes to HRM software, based on my discussions with those in the industry and viewing the SHRM messages boards I break this group into two tiers, top tier and bottom tier based on quality of software, support and overall value.Top tier is Workday , ADP Workforce Now (NASDAQ:ADP) and Ultipro (NASDAQ:ULTI). Bottom tier is Paycom (NYSE:PAYC), Paylocity (NASDAQ:PCTY), Cornerstone (NASDAQ:CSOD) and others. All of these HRM SaaS companies had great 2015 results based on the ACA reporting requirements that went into effect for 2015 tax reporting. All of them are likely to slowing revenues and lots of churn in 2016.My top shorts in the space are ULTI, PCTY and CSOD, but PAYC is also very weak.Healthcare: There is tons of excitement about Healthcare SaaS companies. With excitement comes rampant overvaluation. I suggest you short the slow-growing, lower-margin players in the healthcare space. My top two Shorts in healthcare are Healthstream (NASDAQ:HSTM) and athenahealth (NASDAQ:ATHN). Both companies are expected to grow revenues slowly in 2016, 10% and 19%, respectively, while barely increasing their margins which suggests they overspent on customer acquisition costs.Other: Two other companies that are wildly overvalued and deserve a mention are Ellie Mae (NYSE:ELLI) and Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM). Both companies are profitable, which investors seem to love now, mainly because they don't understand the SaaS business model. They both are valued at over 10 P/S and over 8 forward P/S.Summary Table"
4062102,98236,2017-04-12T18:33:00-04:00,"Ultimate Software shares have been stagnant for two years now.The company has continued its growth trajectory without much change.Chatter about threats from the possible replacement of the ACA, competitive issues with Workday and issues with the NetSuite relationship are of little consequence upon careful inspection.The company should be able to sustain growth between 20% and 25% for a considerable period.The company is modestly profitable although it compares favorably to some of its peers in that regard.","Ultimate Software: Can Investors find value in this name?Ultimate Software (NASDAQ:ULTI) is not a name without controversy. One contributor to this site believes that the company mis-represents its financial statements and reports more revenue than the company has earned. Another contributor feels that the issues are valuation and competition. I will leave the accusations of fraud to one side in this article. It is hard for a company to mis-report its revenues these days and get so many distinct groups to sign off on a financial statement. And it is hard to misinterpret revenue recognition standards these days - not like when I was in the software business and contracts on napkins were reported as revenue. OK, that's my take on fraud.What I do want to examine at some level of detail is the market in which Ultimate operates and its growth potential. Are there really new competitors encroaching, and if so does, Ultimate have an answer? Does Ultimate have a reasonable playbook with which it can sustain growth? How does the recent acquisition of NetSuite by Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) impact expectations for this company? And does the guidance the company has announced leave room for upside?I think that the story has more positives than negatives at this point. This should be a decent year for selling software in the SMB space. I think concerns about the company's erstwhile alliance with NetSuite have been overdone. The company saw lots of momentum exiting Q4, and I expect that Q1 will have produced reasonable results. The real question is valuation which is still high - but not as high as it used to be.Share price performance is one way to solve valuation problemsBy that, I simply mean that if the share price stagnates and sales and earnings continue to rise, valuation falls. And that has been the case here. The shares have done very little over the last two years, appreciating by 10% over that span. By comparison, the IGV index has appreciated by 28% over the past two years and peer Paycom (NYSE:PAYC) has almost doubled.Ultimate is actually growing its top line faster today than it was two years ago, and the company's revenues have increased by 58% over the period while non-GAAP EPS grew by 40%.The main issue in this span of share price frustration has been one of valuation. ULTI's share valuation had gotten far ahead of rational levels two years ago. Have the shares now compressed sufficiently? I think they have, based on growth expectations for revenues and EPS. Undoubtedly, there are people who have differing views on the subject. I will go through valuation in detail later in this article, but it seems fair to say that the worst of the valuation anomaly has passed.The other issue is the outlook. Not the outlook that the company is providing, but the fears that investors have developed about the space. What that means is that while the mean analyst recommendation is just slightly less than buy, according to the data published by First Call and there have not been any recent downgrades, the performance of the shares speak, or don't speak, for themselves. Estimates, in line with company guidance, have a lower Q1 in terms of EPS than was the case 90 days ago but are essentially unchanged for the full year and for 2018. The shares are essentially flat over the period and down by a little since earnings and guidance were announced. The IGV is up by about 10% of the past three months.The company is scheduled to announce Q1 earnings on April 25. The environment for software demand has been favorable. Has the company exceeded its muted guidance for the period? Q1 last year was quite strong with top-line growth of 28% and non-GAAP EPS up by more than 40% from the year earlier period. The company started its quarter with 97% visibility into the company's annual target. While there may be cost elements that can cause EPS to be below targets as was the case for Q4, it is relatively difficult to miss revenues when more than 97% is contractually committed before the period starts.The company is forecasting a 19% growth in total revenue and an 11% growth in EPS for the quarter with top-line growth of more than 24% for the year. The margin contraction implicit in this forecast is due to what the company describes as ""over-hiring"" last year, mainly in sales and marketing which, in turn, was a function of demand running higher than previously expected. Presumably, the increase in sales headcount will have a positive impact on growth later this year, and that is the way the forecast has been put together.Based on company commentary during the quarter at a series of investor meetings and presentations, I think it is reasonable to believe that the odds favor a beat of some kind from the modest growth guidance. In fact, I believe that Q1 earnings are likely to serve as a positive catalyst for the shares.Ultimate: Is HCM a market with an ultimate growth runway or is it a dead end?One of the mis-apprehensions under which some observers labor is the rate of growth in the applications space. It is easy to think that growth in the HCM space is not likely to be able to support a billion dollar company trying to continue its growth in the mid-20 percent range. But the fact is that while payroll and most HR functions have been installed for some years in larger enterprises, there is far more size of the HCM market. Even though almost all enterprises have some form of payroll these days, it can often be very primitive and most SMBs lack most of the functionality that larger enterprises take for granted.Ultimate is one of the leading suppliers of payroll and overall HCM solutions for the small and medium market although, in recent years, it has begun addressing somewhat larger enterprise customers. It is not trying to crack the large enterprise market where every win has to be a competitive displacement and every retention is based on major competitive struggles. Ultimate reported a 97% retention rate last year. The only way that happens is if most of its renewals are non-competitive. Retentions at that rate make it far more likely that the company can achieve growth in the 20%-plus range. The link here is to a study that shows that the market, as defined by this particular research firm, is to grow to $20 billion over the next five years with a CAGR of close to 10%. There are other studies that suggest that the market is growing at around 10% and will reach $20 billion as well.Because Ultimate is a payroll processor, it has and will derive revenues from processing compliance reporting for the Affordable Care Act. The company indicated that it expects ACA-related revenues to be around 2% for 2017 as a whole, with some of those revenues earned already. Obviously, without knowing the specifics of any repeal and the requirements of a replacement, or what the timeline might be for repeal or if it might happen, it is simply fruitless to try to speculate with any granularity as to the actual impact of changes in the ACA on the outlook for this company. It could be an issue for Ultimate's growth although probably not in 2017 and perhaps not at all. No one can really say at this point, and speculation is simply a waste of time and brain cycles.There are plenty of competitors in the space from the stack vendors such as Oracle and SAP (NYSE:SAP) to other specialized vendors that include companies such as Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), Cornerstone (NASDAQ:CSOD) and, of course, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). And there are loads of companies with a point solution that are sold to the lowest rung of businesses. The company has a deep set of solutions, and a key to success has been the attach rate for these solutions. The link here is to a report that is a bit dated but nonetheless covers some of Ultimate's strengths and weaknesses. I think it would be fair to say that at this point, several of the weaknesses mentioned have been ameliorated by the company's development efforts.Most observers of the HCM software market regard Workday as the 600-pound gorilla in the space based both on its architecture and its functionality. It has been the leader in the Gartner surveys for some years running, and that is still the case. Ultimate is listed as a challenger with execution capabilities comparable to leaders but less completeness of vision - and that is probably where Ultimate wants to be. Simpler products that work well for users up to a certain size.But again, there is nothing to suggest that the state of competition has changed between Ultimate and Workday, and indeed, it appears as though this company is growing its HCM business in the same range as WDAY and has forecast that bookings growth will be few percentage points below that of WDAY in this current year. Neither this company nor WDAY provides investors with ARR data, and so it is not either easy or precise to analyze relative growth rates given the difference in increases in deferred revenues between the two companies, but I think concerns about WDAY gobbling up this company's market share are, to say the least, highly exaggerated.But the point is that Ultimate is competing in a segment of the HCM market that is growing significantly more rapidly than the market as a whole (the SMB cohort) and that it has and will continue to enhance its product footprint over time. Can Ultimate wind up with a 10%-plus market share of the expected market by 2021? To do so would require the company to achieve a CAGR of 21-22% after this current year. That honestly doesn't seem to be an unreasonable expectation as the market is structured today and based on the company's willingness to invest in both sales and marketing and research and development.Last quarter, which was a record quarter for product bookings as well as revenue, the company had several wins with enterprises that purchased 10,000 seats or more. The CEO said during the conference call that bookings were more than 20% above plan. How bookings translate into revenues and what happens to a booking is something that cannot be exactly ascertained from the financial statement. That said, it is not inconsistent with the overall growth in the space to believe that the company was able to exceed its plan by a noticeable amount.This company has not and will not have the kinds of wins that companies such as Workday have enjoyed (no Wal-Marts (NYSE:WMT) or Targets (NYSE:TGT)), but it does have a plan to work itself deeper into the mid-market with businesses with 10k-plus employees. The company has recently reorganized its sales force with a dedicated organization to focus on Enterprise potential defined as potential users with more than 2,500 employees. In addition to enterprise, the company also has a specialized sales organization that focuses on the mid-market defined as companies with between 500 and 2,500 employees.I thought it was interesting to note that the CEO said that 38% of the seats - and almost certainly a higher proportion of the revenues - come from users with fewer than 500 seats. That is a market segment that is unlikely to ever interest competitors such as Workday or Oracle.The company most recently bought a business called Kanjoya. Apart from the rather unusual name, Kanjoya is a vendor of what is called workforce intelligence and has integrated that company's product line into something it calls UltiPro Perception. Like most companies selling application software, the company continues to add products in the areas of business analytics and mobile capabilities, many of them developed in conjunction with the specific requirements of users.Again, Ultimate moved to acquire a predictive analytics capability through the acquisition of Vestrics, which has a knowledge base that can measure, predict, and optimize the business impact of HR/talent investments and decisions on a global basis. Whether or not software really can quite do that at this point is a subject similar to debating the efficacy of computer-based weather forecasts but it is part of the changing paradigm of what users of application software want to buy, i.e. software that produces actionable outputs.Overall, management reported that its marketing metrics both in Q4 2016 and for the full year showed record demand for the company's solution. Just how much credence ought to be placed in some of these numbers from an Ultimate survey is a legitimate question. But for what they are worth the company had an increase of 46% in respondents looking to buy an HCM system in the next 12 months or less. To a certain extent, surveys like that tend to be self-selecting users who want to buy and are the ones most likely to answer the survey. But the year-on-year numbers are impressive. The company also presented other typically favorable trends regarding demand and engagement with users. I am not about to say that Ultimate has the best HCM solution in its target space - I am not even sure how that might be objectively measured. But it certainly has the attributes that are readily visible to suggest that its market share gains should continue unabated over the next several years.As most readers are aware, Oracle bought NetSuite in late November, and Oracle executives have mentioned their intention to cease the partnership that NetSuite and Ultimate have enjoyed. Precisely how and when that will happen is not known at this point. NetSuite represented about 4% of Ultimate's bookings last year. The company's forecast includes a zero contribution from NetSuite this year.One of the reasons why the company forecast some growth slowdown in the quarter is simply the way it does its math in putting together guidance and the coverage ratio it wants to see when it makes forecasts. There is a certain mechanistic quality in expecting that the absence of NetSuite, were that to happen, would take down revenues by 4%, but it is part of the forecast even though the relationship is not yet terminated.Will the company ultimately suffer market share losses to Oracle? Will NetSuite, or what is left of it, successfully sell Oracle HCM solutions to smaller customers? The preponderance of the evidence would not suggest that is likely.Is the company's success based on pricing/excessive discounting as has been suggested? Far be it for me to say that Ultimate and every other software vendor that has or will exist doesn't discount significantly and continuously in order to win deals. I think that any business where the incremental product cost of an additional unit is effectively zero will most likely find it advantageous to trade price for competitive wins. With a 97% renewal rate, the economic arguments for discounting are compelling. Ultimate has gone through its own transition in becoming a cloud vendor. As is the case with any transition, there were obviously rough spots and customers not entirely satisfied. Just for the record, during the conference call, in response to a question, management said that discounting isn't rife and is under careful control. I am inclined to believe that as is the case for any enterprise software, large and competitive deals will see some level of discounting, but not more now than in the past.But at the end of the day, Ultimate has a reasonably profitable business strategy that is leading operating trends to decent levels for investors. It would be tedious in the extreme to analyze all of the other standalone companies in the space, adjust for stock-based comp, and analyze cost trends and growth trends, and try to evaluate some of the unique metrics of each competitor. But in the next section, I will simply look at Ultimate's cost trends on an absolute basis and see if there are specific trends and insights that can be drawn.Costs and revenue growth: The two sides of the argumentThe CEO of this company is clearly someone with a sales background and remains focused on growth. He explicitly said during the course of the conference call that if it came to a choice between growth and profitability, he would choose growth. The company does carefully track and manage to revenue per month per employee which is a proxy for operating margins - and it continues to rise. But the company will spend what it takes to achieve 20%-plus revenue growth targets into the foreseeable future.The company mentioned that it ""over-hired"" in the second half of last year and that its hiring will be at a slower cadence this year. So, to some extent, the comparisons that I am presenting here are known to have some element of excess costs. The other thing to know about this company is that it capitalizes software development costs which have tended, over time, to increase reported profitability. All of the comparisons below are based on GAAP, which reflect real spending. I will comment below on stock-based compensation.For the year, the company reported gross margins of 61.5%. That is more or less comparable to year earlier gross margins. In Q4, gross margins declined 50 bps year on year, primarily because of early hiring in the services area.Sales and marketing costs rose by about 100 bps for the year to 28.7% but showed some positive trends in Q4 when they fell by about 60 bps year on year. As mentioned, management expects that operational results will show negative trends for that expense ratio in Q1 with consistent improvement throughout the balance of the year.Research and development and development costs are around 15% of revenue. They were slightly greater in Q4 on a GAAP basis, reflecting the integration of a couple of smaller acquisitions made earlier in the year, which were primarily research and development operations.General and administrative costs did not show any material leverage last year. They were around 12% of revenue for the year, up marginally from the prior year. They were also 12% of revenues in Q4.Overall, margins for the year were 170 bps below levels of the prior year. The 5.3% GAAP operating margins are not likely to show a significant increase this year but are more likely to do so in 2018.The company does use a significant level of stock-based comp. This is an old discussion for this company and for many others. It is what it is, and I am surely not going to change it. Stock-based comp for the company rose by 38% last year and wound up at 14.5% of revenues. It rose by 30% in Q4 and was 13.8% of revenues. The overall impact on reported earnings was significantly less because of the tax impact. Overall, the company reported non-GAAP EPS of $3.16. Of that amount, non-GAAP after-tax adjustments contributed $2.17/share. Last year, the company increased reported non-GAAP EPS by $.51. Non-GAAP adjustments contributed $.28 of the increase. I would be loath to suggest when those kinds of trends are likely to change - certainly, there was nothing during the course of the conference call that might have suggested that any of the analysts were concerned about the level of stock-based compensation.ValuationUltimate shares have a price this morning of $199/share. At the end of the year, the company had 30.4 million shares outstanding, a 2% increase from a year earlier. That represents a market capitalization of about $6 billion. The company has less than $100 million of cash. The First Call revenue consensus, which matches company guidance, is for revenues of $969 million. So that is an EV/S of 6.2X-not a bargain, but not extended based on valuations of peer vendors with substantially comparable growth rates.The company is forecasting non-GAAP EPS this year of $3.97. That is a P/E of 50X, again, not a bargain but lower than the P/E of many other vendors is this space. I have no way of trying to figure out what the contribution of stock-based comp will be to this year's earnings other than to suggest it will not likely be lower than it was in 2016.The company's operating cash flow (CFFO) is typically greater than its reported non-GAAP earnings and that has been the case the past two years. But no one buying the shares is doing so because of its free cash flow yield. Unlike some peers, the company does not generate a great deal of deferred revenue and that which it does is typically the payment of one-year service agreements in advance.Just for the record, Ultimate's CFFO was $160 million last year, up about 12% compared to 2015. Free cash flow was $90 million, and that provided a free cash flow yield of 1.5%. With capex likely to fall this year and with other operating metrics improving, free cash flow could reach $160-180 million this year - still below what would be necessary to portray this as a cash flow story.Is ULTI the ultimate bargain? It never has been and there is no reason to think it will be in the foreseeable future. Is the setup right? I think it is as good as it is likely to get. The company has been on a roll. Regardless of the promotional qualities of the CEO, it is likely that the company had the kind of Q4 he spoke of, and he has been equally vocal since that time in extolling the strength of his business. The bear arguments do not stand up to close scrutiny. The likely catalyst will be the upcoming earnings report. I think that the risk/rewards are stacked in the favor of investors at this point."

We noted that its margins were suspiciously higher than its peers, and raised concerns about the potential for cost capitalization related to its U.S. plant expansion.

As far as the long term, we had two unique situations with customers who wanted to pay in advance for several years.""ULTI CFO Response: ""We've always told investors don't pay attention to the deferred revenue in the billings calculation that you guys normally do because we have activation fees running through there and they don't run in the same kind of pattern. It's just layering on subscription revenues.""ULTI CFO Response: ""Yeah. I would say that with that caution, we ask you not to focus on the billings number, but like I said last quarter, when you do have strong sales quarter, it is going to inflate that percentage. It's going to - I shouldn't say inflate, it's going to be reflected in that. So the bottom line is your billings calculation does reflect the strong billings Scott talked about - strong bookings Scott referred to in this quarter and during the year.""Management then made murky changes to deferred revenue definition:New Deferred Revenue Discussion (As defined in 2015 10-K):Previous Deferred Revenue With Changed/Omitted Disclosures in Red (As defined in 2014 10-K)More Evidence Suggesting Possible Revenue OverstatementSource: Leiter Landing IRS Tax filings available hereNote: Tax calendar yr is from Feb 1-Jan 31st which differs by one month from UTLI's FY salesAggressive Capitalization of Sales CommissionsPay Attention: ULTI is now stretching out the amortization period an additional yearWarning: Explosive Capitalization of R&D and Software Development CostsULTI Is Delaying Amortization, And Its Policy Is Way Off-Market To PeersULTI has made multiple changes to its amortization assumptions.

3875686,58041,2016-02-08T14:55:00-05:00,Significant relative outlier in the SaaS space; trades at 44% multiple premium to the SaaS peer group average on EV/2016 revenue basis.Trades at 137% premium to LNKD on EV/adj EBITDA multiple despite LinkedIn guiding for same constant currency revenue growth in 2016 and having 300bps better adj EBITDA margins.Trades at 181% premium to Tableau on 2015 EV/operating cash flow despite DATA's better growth and margins.Benefiting from broad-based H2 2015/H1 2016 spike related to the Affordable Health Care reporting compliance deadline that will turn into a growth headwind in 2016/2017.,"Ticker: Ultimate Software Group (NASDAQ:ULTI) US EquityRecommendation: ShortOver the past six months, we have had a small short position in Ultimate Software as we've viewed it as one of the more inappropriately relatively valued SaaS stocks. The company has been around for 25 years, is very well run, is regarded as a great place to work, and generally speaking, has been a pretty steady eddy executor in the mid-market North American payroll/HR software space. Usually, it's very tough to get excited about shorting a name like this because it never turns into a valuation outlier. In recent months, it has caught more of our attention as it slowly started to push itself into outlier territory in an arguably compressing SaaS multiple landscape. This led us to do more work on the name as we tried to better understand the market dynamics in the SMB to mid-market payroll/HR space in North America. This has been a fruitful endeavor, and we believe that we have come away with a compelling short thesis based on our research.Normally, that would be the entire focus of our report, but things in tech and more notably SaaS really have drastically changed over the past two weeks. The change has been so drastic as to basically render our stock-specific short thesis almost entirely irrelevant. This is because we were previously focusing on proving why Ultimate's discount multiple to SaaS and tech's high growth and relatively fresh faced stock story darlings should be relatively wider than it already was. This is something we no longer have to prove as ULTI now trades at a premium valuation to all these names. Consequently, we recently decided to aggressively up our short exposure post the company's Q4 results on Wednesday Feb. 2nd as the stock temporarily pushed into SaaS relative nosebleed valuation territory. We got some immediate return benefit out of this in the post LinkedIn/Tableau tech bloodbath on Friday, but we are now extremely confident there is a lot more to come. We believe that Ultimate Software is the most obviously blatant short in all the software space at this time.Here is why...This is what your SaaS darling valuation comp table looked like at close of market on Friday Feb. 4th. Almost every name (Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) and Medidata (NASDAQ:MDSO) being current exceptions) on this list has already provided guidance for 2016 top-line growth.The group average ex-Ultimate is 4.38x EV/2016 est. rev. This puts Ultimate at a 41% premium to the average, and a 10% premium to the group leader. ULTI has typically traded at a 25% minimum EV/rev discount to the SaaS hyper growth darlings. This gap has narrowed somewhat as it has shown some slightly increased operating momentum over the past two quarters, which we will get to later, but to be clear, you are not going to find anyone on the sell side or buy side arguing that Ultimate should have the highest multiple in this group. In fact, almost every sell-side report gets at a valuation for the stock by applying some sort of EV/rev forward multiple discount to the likes of Workday (WDAY) or higher growing SMB payroll or broader cloud peers. So, for those who care about broker targets, Ultimate's numbers have to come way, way down and very, very fast.How much lower you may ask?Well, if Ultimate trades…At the peer group, EV/sales forward avg., the stock should be $117. At Workday's current forward EV/sales multiple, it should be $152. At a 20% discount to Workday and ServiceNow's forward EV/sales multiples, it should be $119. And what about if traded at Tableau's forward EV/sales multiple which has essentially the same revenue base and is expected to grow at 30% this year. Well, at that multiple, it's a $67 stock. And if you want to get into cash flow, well, it's even worse. At Tableau's 2015 operating cash flow multiple, Ultimate is worth $59. And if it traded like LinkedIn on an EV/adj EBITDA multiple of 2015 EBITDA, the stock should be $70. Blend these all together and you are looking at on average 40% downside from here or a $100 stock.Now you may say, hey, wait a minute Ultimate has much better operating margins than Workday and ServiceNow, so maybe that matters more in this environment. Ok, yes that could be the case. Then again those two companies are global SaaS players with much bigger TAMs whose current growth rates are also understated because of significant currency headwinds. However, if adjusted EBITDA multiples are the story, the downside looks even worse when you compare them against Tableau and LinkedIn or the vertically-focused SaaS names. Ahh, but the data visualization market is more niche and there is serious competition there, so that's why that trades where it is at.Yeah, ok, and then what do you think the North American payroll/HR SMB and mid-market is like? Is that more niche than the global DV market? Well, we can tell you that it is a heck of a lot more crowded, and it's going to get even more crowded. Where do you think pricing is headed in this market with startups giving away the software for free? How much more desperate are those startups going to be to win new business in this environment? By the way, Ultimate's growth story and the other niche payroll/HR NA market focused players has been about a replacement trade against the service bureaus; do you want to pay a huge premium for that? Ok, fine, maybe this all resonates, but LinkedIn is not a good comp as the market is discounting job market headwinds in the name as we get into the back half of the year. Do you think those same headwinds don't apply to payroll/HR provider whose growth is coming from small- and medium-sized businesses?We can go on with back and forth, and in a stable or expanding growth multiple environment, that is precisely what we all do. That conversation is for a different market. In a normal environment, there will be several outliers on the high and low end. This stock's discount is warranted because the TAM is smaller. No its premium is warranted because the margins are far higher. No, don't focus on margins here as they are in investment mode, and the top-line growth is off the charts and justifies the premium. No, no, no, the names with much lower top-line growth and more narrow market focus deserve a decent discount to the big boys. The valuation battle goes on and on and on...But in this tape, there is no such battle. There are faster-growing and higher-EBITDA-margin software and related tech companies trading at huge discounts to Ultimate, and huge TAM global SaaS giants with the previously loved ""land grab"" top-line revenue stories also trading at discounts. Basically, thanks to a broad rerate of how technology stocks are valued, it is the most identifiable outlier we have ever come across in a deep public market tech sub segment. Normally, when you come across something like this, there is some new paradigm story you need to work hard to disprove like a Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY), and even then, there may be a few similarly situated names in the same neighborhood that skeptics can point to and say, ""well, what about that one as well?"" That's not the case here. Ultimate's model is well understood, and the universe that exists to value it well established. The problem is that universe just drastically changed, and it is now sitting there all alone simply waiting for the laws of market gravity to quickly bring it in!If you made it this far, you should stop here as this is essentially all we are focused on in this short. It is really that straightforward. But for those looking for more conviction, here is some icing on the cake!Ultimate Software: A Brief Short ThesisWhen we first started shorting Ultimate late last year, we really didn't have an infallible thesis. We knew the company was exceptionally well run, and that it was growing at a measured pace in the North American payroll/HR market. It was essentially one of the few names to make a smooth on-premise to cloud transition, and there was pretty much nothing we didn't like about the business. We just thought that the market was starting to overpay for the slight uptick in operating momentum that it was experiencing.We were familiar with the company's decision to push into the 300-500 employee firm space over the past 12 months, and believed it was getting a decent boost because of this decision, thanks to heightened payroll/HR provider selection activity around the Affordable Care Act (ACA) compliance reporting deadlines. Basically, we developed a view that while ACA filing enhancement capabilities were not going to be a big revenue boost, the Spring 1094/1095 IRS forms filing deadline was spurring firms in the SMB to mid-market space to evaluate new vendors and or upgrade existing suites. So essentially ULTI was catching a nice regulatory-driven spike in overall business activity at the same time it had decided to push more downstream into the market most affected by that spike.As far as we are concerned, regulatory deadline driven spikes in business activity are great because they distort baseline demand and are always followed by predictable hangovers in activity. From a short-selling perspective, all you need is a market that all of a sudden decides to get carried away by this spike to create an opportunity for you to exploit. In our view, that opportunity started to materialize last year. FX headwinds took a lot of the steam out of the SaaS heavyweights, leaving Ultimate as one of the few names with a very jubilant conference call for investors to get excited about it. The melt up seemed like a nice and easy short opportunity as you sat back and waited for its luster to wear off in H2 2016 and going into 2017. The problem with that view though was we were not that confident in it as management had us really believing what was going on here was very unique to ULTI.When asked about ACA driving activity in Q3, here is what Ultimate's CEO had to say on that conference call:And here is what he had to say on the Q4 conference call last week:While we get Ultimate's management being dismissive of ACA functionality as a differentiator/revenue booster, we really were not sold on it, denying its role in new business generation momentum.This is because on the same conference call, it highlighted metrics like this:So, a 50% y-o-y increase in new potential business interest has nothing to do with ACA? The deadline isn't helping the new strategic sales team close deals in the 300-500 employee firm range? We had a hard time reconciling this after the Q3 call, but, by the Q4 call, the picture cleared up a lot for us. The reason for this was actually a short thesis we were pitched on payroll/HR provider Paycom Software (PYCM) just a few days after Ultimate reported its Q3. We were admittedly ignorant to the name until this thesis found its way to us, but thankfully, it did because it opened our eyes to what was going on in the sector. Despite the appeal of the thesis, we didn't short Paycom, but as its target market was exclusively in the SMB/mid-market space that was delivering a boost to ULTI, it naturally caught our attention. Then, a week later, Paycom reported its results and delivered 51% y-o-y revenue growth which was 400bps above consensus and an acceleration from Q2's 47% . The stock jumped nearly 30% the next morning, which naturally got us thinking maybe we are shorting the wrong name, but that at the same time, our ACA demand boost thesis was more likely accurate.So we started going through Paycom's conference calls as well as the even more SMB-focused Paylocity's (NASDAQ:PCTY) (100 employee average payroll/HR customer size) conference calls and results. What we discovered was pretty clear. Paycom started 2015 guiding for 29% revenue growth and it is going to end up delivering close to 50% growth. PCTY guided for similar 30% growth and also raised that closer to 50% when it reported last Thursday (the Paylocity numbers are eye-popping as growth spiked to 60% y-o-y in the most recent quarter). Clearly, both these firms experienced significant accelerations in demand into year-end.Now put this all together and you have a much clearer picture of what is going in the space. The demand pulled forward, thanks to ACA, is as clear as day. All three firms have seen the spikes at the same time, so you can't really argue with that; but that's not even the whole story here.Paycom and Ultimate get 50%+ of their business from the giant service bureaus like ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) and Ceridian. ADP reported results last week, and here is a nice little excerpt from its conference call:Here is ADP telling you that, thanks to ACA, its customers, many of which they are trying to migrate at an accelerated pace from their legacy offerings to their cloud platforms, churn has spiked. So you've had both a combination of accelerated service bureau migrations and ACA deadline compliance as powerful tailwinds in the SMB/mid-market payroll/HR provider space. Set against that backdrop, Ultimate's 200bps bump in top-line growth at the same time it ramped up its strategic sales team doesn't exactly look all that impressive. Management can say what it wants, but broad demand bumps like this can turn into awful hangovers pretty fast.So why not short Paycom and Paylocity instead?We actually don't have a major problem with that idea, but both these names trade at around 20% discounts on EV/forward revenue basis to Ultimate's current multiple. This is despite the fact that Paylocity delivered 60% revenue growth last quarter and Paycom 51% versus 26% for ULTI. Also, these names already have pretty steep growth rate declines baked into forward estimates as well as coming off lower revenue bases. In our view, they also don't have the very likely increased competition headaches and headwinds that are likely looming for Ultimate on the larger enterprise side. Then, there are the questions around introducing more churn into ULTI's model by going down-market as well as exposing itself to core value proposition erosion as it goes up against more of these guys.Going up market is great if you are in the down market, but going down market to get revenue comes with a whole bag of potential future headaches. That being said, we'd obviously rather own the well-established more broadly diversified Ultimate over either of them in the long term, and wouldn't be shocked to see both names cut by more than half. This is because we view these names as 2nd and 3rd tier stocks and not really part of the broader SaaS blue-chip comp universe, and obviously, because they are clearly a lot more levered to a slowdown in overall payroll/HCM selection activity going into next year. But as we pointed out at the start of this section, this is the icing on the cake. Our enthusiasm around this position is based on what is going on in the 1st tier names in software where you don't have liquidity and typically different type of shareholder base elements potentially creating thesis execution headaches.ConclusionUltimate is trading at current levels simply because it reported what seemed like relevant good news right before a ""bear market"" stamp got placed on tech. It in fact got more expensive during Friday's LinkedIn/Tableau inspired sell-off despite a 10% decline on the day. This is because the likes of Workday, Splunk, ServiceNow, NetSuite, and Salesforce.com declined even more. Those investors long the stock are probably taking some temporary comfort in this ""relative outperformance"", but in this environment, that is not going to go very far. Sell-side models will be updated, and price targets on the name drastically cut. As for the buy-side picture here; investors who think tech is cheap now have dozens of great stories they can pick up at massive discounts to Ultimate, and will re-balance away from it. Meanwhile bearish inclined tech investors scavenging for what is left to short will be all over the name as it literally jumps off their Bloomberg screen at them.

To some, I suppose, Ultimate Software (NASDAQ:ULTI) sounds pretentious. Maybe it is the Florida location. How could a serious software company be located in the suburbs of Ft. Lauderdale? Actually, however, Weston, FL, Ultimate's home, turns out to be a high-income, business-friendly community that had the largest job growth in the state of Florida. Perhaps, it is the company's mission statement which to some might seem more than a little platitudinous and even a bit condescending. Or it could be that the company is completely focused on HCM and will likely remain so for the foreseeable future. While Ultimate has a very broad line of HCM products from Talent Management to payroll processing to workforce analytics, it has never ventured outside of its HCM and that might be considered an outlier strategy for a company of its size. Many people are anxious to see multi-legged ""stools."" Why do people write negative articles on this site - almost certainly because of valuation and a different way of valuing names.The company has had an outstanding track record going back quite a number of years. Since 2009, revenues have grown quite consistently from $196 million to $618 million and are projected to reach $780 million this year, up another 26%. Non-GAAP profit margins also have increased from just above break-even in 2009 to the 20%-plus range the last couple of years. The company has been increasing non-GAAP margins by 100 bps/year the past three years. The company's transition to the cloud and to a recurring revenue model started around 2002 and it is long over. It hasn't sold on-premise licenses since the start of 2009. As a result, it has valuations that appear high. Some contributors on this site seemingly hate to see the success of companies such as this that defy Graham-Dodd sensibilities. These naysayers look for such companies to implode without analyzing their business carefully. I'm reasonably sure that if either Professor Graham or Professor Dodd were alive today, they would recognize that elements of value may change over the years and that growth rates, steady performance and visibility have much to commend themselves to investors in an uncertain world.Some readers might observe that I recently wrote an article on Talent Management leader Cornerstone OnDemand (NASDAQ:CSOD). I suggested that CSOD was in far too narrow a space, that sometimes its quarters are too reliant on large deals and that it has had a pattern of somewhat checkered results. The devil, as the saying goes, is really in the details.ULTI does indeed sell Talent Management solutions. And beside that it sells solutions for payroll processing and basic HR functionality that are hardly the most exciting space in the world. And like CSOD, ULTI now has a revenue model that is totally subscription based except for the consulting/implementation it does for its subscription clients. Of course, ULTI actually makes reasonable non-GAAP margins and even has a level of GAAP profitability. And growth rates look comparable between ULTI and CSOD.The differences, however, are in precisely what is being sold, to whom it is being sold and the specific requirements of the sales process. Some readers might say here - too much detail. Cut to the bottom line. For me, the bottom line is that there is much to commend in investing in ULTI and quite a bit to avoid in considering an investment in CSOD. Investments that may seem the same on the surface can have far different outlooks when considering details.The company does use stock-based comp like most software companies, and stock-based comp has increased swiftly the past three years. In 2015, stock-based comp was 13% of revenues, and the company's GAAP margin was 7%. Stock-based comp has continued to increase, and it was 14% of revenues in Q1 2016. The company's cash flow margin trends are decent, albeit from a modest base. Deferred revenues have just recently started to grow recently, which has, in turn, led to the current modest level of operating cash flow although it has started to increase noticeably. Operating cash flow climbed almost 40% last year, and free cash flow was up almost 50%. In Q1, operating cash flow increased 23% year on year, and free cash flow was about flat. The company doesn't forecast cash flow or free cash flow metrics. My guess in the absence of guidance is that free cash flow for the year will increase about 30-40% to around $81 million. Free cash flow of $81 million represents a margin of 10.4% lower than that metric is for some other successful software vendors.With the kind of track record in the first sentences of the above paragraph, it isn't too surprising that the shares are highly valued. There simply aren't many other enterprise software companies that have consistently grown by 25%-plus since the Great Recession and are comfortably non-GAAP profitable. On the Q1 conference call, CEO Scott Scherr said that the company had 99% visibility for its guidance for the balance of the year. At the end of the day, it is the consistency of performance and the forward visibility that have contributed to the valuation of this name. Some investors are going to understand and appreciate the consistency and visibility. Others, for whatever reason, do not.Most analysts love companies that beat their revenue and EPS targets consistently and this one is no different in that regard. So long as it continues to achieve that kind of performance, the company's valuation might look elevated to some - but I do get surprised when I see articles on this site that compare this company's valuation to the valuation of other companies such as Tableau (NYSE:DATA) and LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD), which are, at the moment, broken stocks. Almost all large institutions that I have known favor consistency and visibility more than everything else. Put that together with 26% growth and steady to rising non-GAAP margins in, and of course the price seems high and the valuation seems high - until you consider what alternative investments might produce in terms of operating results.Currently, the company has an EV/S based on consensus sales estimates for 2016 of $780 million. Its P/E again is based on 2016 consensus forecasts of non-GAAP EPS of $3.30 is 63X and it is 51X estimates for 2017. The company's free cash flow yield based on my projection for the current year is around 1.3%. Those kind of metrics are basically a function of the company's consistency and visibility. If you like consistency and visibility coupled with substantial growth, these are the shares within the IT space you want to own.For investors looking for high cash flow margins or lower valuations, ULTI is not a name to consider. The next section is about valuation and the company's track record, but as a preview, I believe the company is more likely than not to continue on its course, and I further believe that investors will continue to pay the premium for visibility, stability and growth. The market in this case is doing a good job of ""pricing in"" the value of the company's operating trends. Like many things in life, with Ultimate's shares, you get what you pay for. So long as the company's business environment doesn't alter too much, the it can produce solid, steady and unspectacular forward returns for investors.Last year, the company's shares were up 33%. The company was expensive on a ""traditional"" basis at the start of 2015 and it remains so to this day based on traditional metrics. On the other hand, operating cash flow grew 40% last year, revenues were up 22% and EPS increased by 25.5%. Boring to some, overvalued to others - and as Goldilocks once put it, ""just right"" for many investors.Can the valuation and the track record be sustained?Foresight is a gift of the Gods, and I was passed over when the Gods endowed me with whatever I was endowed with. Needless to say, a company whose CEO says that its revenue forecast is 99% visible after the first quarter of the year is like a Christian with the serene confidence of a hand with four aces. There are very few companies, either in the IT world or in any other space, that could make such a commentary. The valuation of ULTI rests solidly on that kind of visibility.The exact size of the HCM market is really based on its definition. The company calls its market opportunity unified cloud and payroll market. Needless to say, that definition is not matched by definitions used by research services. I found the best definition of the unified HCM market to come from something called the Starr Conspiracy. Most of the above figures are from its business intelligence unit. In any event, the number it uses for HCM market size comes to $131 billion. There are other surveys that are published that with different definitions estimate the HCM market to be less than $20 billion. Starr estimates some of the sizes of the available market as follows: Payroll and Benefits $41 billion, Talent Management $14 billion, Talent Acquisition $72 billion, and HR and Benefits Administration $62 billion. It is pretty clear that ULTI is active in all of those categories. That being said, I would have to guess that there is some element of double counting in these estimates. When most industry participants speak of Talent Management, they include Talent Acquisition, so there is doubtless some kind of definitional mismatch in the above numbers. Regardless of the specifics, ULTI has an addressable market that will allow it to grow 20-25% for the foreseeable future.Starr estimates that the growth rate of the market as it defines it to be 8.5%. That is more or less consistent with estimates of other industry consultants. It is a long, long way from 8.5% to 20-25% growth that ULTI needs to support its valuation. There are a couple of trends that I think will bridge the difference.One commentary of note in the analysis is that the largest greenfield component of the addressable market is in the small/medium size space. Overall, users with fewer than 5,000 employees have far lower penetration rates of advanced HCM solutions than enterprise customers. Most of ULTI's business is concentrated in enterprises of less than 5,000 employees. Indeed, the company is expected to roll out a solution that encompasses enterprises with fewer than 500 employees at some time later this year. Many competitors in the space have rolled out what they have called ""lite"" versions of their standard product. Those have interfaces and other requirements that are simply too demanding for the SMB space. There are huge numbers of companies in the mid-market space that are still using Excel to get much of their work done.It is hard to relate the number of greenfield sites to a specific growth rate, but it is one reason why ULTI has had such consistent results over the years. It has few large deals and its quarters aren't built on closing any particular customer. I wrote a report the other day commenting about CSOD and its strong Q1. I commented that most of its success was a function of closing large deals in Q1. That is not something that is a risk for this company.One trend that is not and will not play a role in market share gains or losses is technology. According to most observers, technology is a temporary advantage at best. Almost every buzzword trend that is touted by vendors is soon copied by competitors and produces not a whit of long-term moat. No vendor is going to be able to differentiate based on technology.The other key trend becoming apparent is the ability to sell a full suite of integrated products. For example, time and attendance reporting is pretty mundane. But if the vendor has a full HCM suite, then the software can discover that there are regulatory caps on how many hours employees can work and if that number leaves an enterprise short of the hours required to meet a sales projection that is relevant. A unified suite will look at who in the organization can be trained to add to the hours supplied and recruiting software can be used to expedite the hiring process. Again, a trend such as that benefits ULTI in terms of market share significantly. Playing in just a single part of the HCM space is not a long-term alternative for vendors who want to retain their customers.In terms of ULTI, the integrated platform plays out in its attach rates. Overall, attach rates for this company in some key product lines range from 68% to 88%. Attach rates could be the difference between in-line quarters and beat and raise quarters. These days, ULTI has 10 or more products that can be attached to its platform. It is one of the significant growth opportunities for the company. The attach rates beyond payroll are the numbers on which to focus.A further growth driver to mention is pricing. This company's model is based on a monthly charge per active user. The company is currently servicing about 4-5 million active customer records. It currently has an average monthly charge of between $8 and $10/user, but the potential charge per user is $27 per month. That is a very large upsell opportunity and is a further part of the path to achieving long-term growth of between 20% and 25%.In a business without technology moats as this one is, the potential for increased competition is always present. At some point, Workday (NYSE:WDAY) is going to decide it wants a piece of the action where the strongest growth is forecast to be. It has built its business doing large deals and replacing Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) installations as the customers of those companies move to the cloud. ULTI is not going to win against WDAY all of the time. The CEO said the win rate against Workday is 50%. And at some point, at least SAP is probably going to try to leverage what it has in this space through its SuccessFactors code base and offer a real mid-market solution. Oracle says it already does have such an offering, but that claim appears to be smoke and mirrors. Potential WDAY competition in the lower half of the enterprise market and in the mid-market is the biggest risk this company faces.Overall, the market environment should be conducive to ULTI having the runway that it needs to grow 20-25% for years to come despite the fact that the HCM market is apparently growing at about 8.5%.ULTI's business model - can it be sustained?ULTI has a business model that looks quite different than the business models of most subscription-based software companies. Last year. the company's GAAP spend on sales and marketing was about 27%. The ratio climbed to 29% in Q1, which is mainly a function of typical seasonality. As many readers of my articles or this site are aware, loads of cloud software companies spend 50% or more of their revenues on the sales and marketing line. Why the big difference? It is primarily a function of what is sold and whom it is sold to.Most companies with a SaaS revenue model look very carefully at retention rates. In the long run, it is the retention rate that's going to be one of the single largest factors in determining profitability. CRM has a churn rate of about 9% that has shown a tendency to fall over recent years. This company has a churn rate of less than 3%. That's probably as good as any company can realistically hope to achieve, especially given that about half of its business is in the mid-market where clients can and do go out of business more frequently than is the case with larger clients.The second major factor is again this company gets 45% of its revenues from the mid-market. Selling to the mid-market obviously has shorter sales cycles, less discounting and it is a more structured process. Users do not buy from a catalog at this point, but overall it just costs far less to sell to the mid-market than it ever will to sell large competitive deals to super demanding clients. Even the other 55% of the company's sales, while called enterprise, are really nothing like the large deals on which companies such as Oracle and SAP have to live.And while it is still very early days, at this point about 5% of revenues are coming from the NetSuite (NYSE:N) partnership, which will have lower direct sales expense.To an extent, the offset to lower sales and marketing spend is the level of gross margins, which were 61.3% last year compared to 59.6% the prior year. Gross profits have continued to rise a bit this year with Q1 gross margins moving up from 60.6% to 61.4% this year. Some of that is simply efficiencies in the services component of revenue and some of it was ""go-lives"" sooner than planned. All of that being said, however, gross margins of 61% have some upside potential over time primarily because services gross margins are so low. GAAP Services gross margins were just $1.6 million in this past quarter or a 4.6% rate. Non-GAAP services margins of 9.3% are far lower than they ought to be. The company has a services business model called ""Partners for Life,"" which basically provides customers a fixed fee for utilization. Fixed fees for installation are clearly a differentiator and appeal greatly to SMB users who are frightened of software installation in general. At some point, ULTI is probably going to need to adjust its model for providing implementation. It is too large a business to ignore.Product gross margins in any given quarter will tend to reflect the amount of software vs. the amount of payroll processing this company does (Payroll processing was actually the genesis of this company and it still churns out W-2s and 1095s and Affordable Care records).Overall, there is probably upside in that metric as well. Paycom (NYSE:PAYC), which is a fairly comparable company with more ""printing"" in its mix, has gross margins of 85% or so.ULTI's spend on R&D is pretty typical for a company of this size and in this space. GAAP R&D spend was just shy of 15% this year and was unchanged year on year. The non-GAAP spend rate was 11.7%.G&A expense is at a level where it too can be a contributor to operating margins going forward. The GAAP G&A provision was 11.5% this past quarter's revenue and the non-GAAP expense was 7.5%. I assume that G&A costs will ultimately show some operating leverage as the company scales its business.Overall, I think this company's business model should produce a higher profit margin going forward, particularly on the gross margin line.Where does all the cash go?OK - this company has a strong and sustainable growth rate, and its business model looks solid with potential upside. But where is the cash flow? The operating cash flow margin last quarter was all of 9%. What is happening?Simply put, this company converts most of its bookings into revenues in the quarter that they are received. Most subscription-based companies sign multi-year agreements with large customers who want some level of future visibility in their spend and have plenty of cash flow of their own to buy software ahead. CRM now has a few deals in which the user has signed up for seven years. That isn't the case for this company which for the most part sells to the lower half of the enterprise market and below.The company has just recently started to sell larger deals to larger customers. In 2015, deferred revenues grew by 6X compared to 2014 although they are still just 6% of revenues. Deferred revenue more than doubled in Q1-2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Still, deferred revenues in Q1 were just 2% of revenues.Basically, this company generates far less net cash than a typical subscription model software company that mainly sells large enterprise software deals. Over time, I imagine that deferred revenue will rise modestly as there are large software deals that this company competes for and wins. And I think that the likely course of future profitability will be higher as well. But I just do not think that the future holds operating cash flow margins in the 40%-plus range that are being generated by WDAY and Palo Alto (NYSE:PANW).To a certain extent, investors in ULTI are making a trade-off. On the one hand, they can see a CEO assert that the balance of his guided year is 99% visible. On the other hand, some SaaS vendors are growing faster at a larger scale than this company is. Those companies do need to close significant transactions to meet both bookings and reported revenue targets. I would like to say that I think this company can achieve comparable gross margins to those currently generated by PANW and by WDAY. I would like to say that, but it is unlikely. I think over the next five years, the company might double its operating cash flow margin, but there is simply no balance sheet metric other than deferred revenue growth that could produce meaningful cash flow growth.It is better to make love than warWell, not always. Nations as opposed to businesses wind up not being able to paper over differences of values and principles. But in the business world, if you can pull it off, the odds are greater than 50% your company will be better for it.On March 25, 2015, Ultimate and NetSuite announced a significant partnership. The companies will refer leads to each other depending on user requirements. No big deal. There is no money involved in that kind of partnership and salesmen will simply ignore it. No money - no activity.The big deal is a joint solution that will allow potential and current customers to acquire a single platform that integrates the NetSuite ERP offerings with Ultimate's HCM offerings. There was minimal product overlap between the two companies - it simply gives each sales force a broader set of functionality to sell. And it seems to be working. Ultimate reported that the new offering was responsible for about 5% of its current business and it expects that level to rise to 10% by the close of this year.Most partnerships that are seen in the software world mean very little. They are announced with much fanfare and shortly thereafter they sink into the sea. Here there is a specific new deliverable that both parties need in order to grow. At some point, without this agreement, Ultimate would have to either acquire or build an ERP system, and the opposite is true with regard to NetSuite and HCM.Some specific product benefits include enhanced data integrity because data is entered but once, single user sign on for both HCM and business aps, a higher level of data that can be run with analytics platforms and the seamless movement of new hire data from ULTI's payroll/on-boarding systems to the ERP system.The product is intended to compete against Oracle and SAP, and I imagine that it will be successful in attracting some users - not the giant ones, but the mid-market ones that are moving to the cloud and will be able to reevaluate their current stack vendor for the first time in many years.The companies have not released specific financial details of the partnership. But the inference that might be drawn is that NetSuite will sell more of the ULTI product than vice versa. That might have a salutary effect on profit margins going forward. As there is little or no basis to quantify the longer-term potential results of the unified product offering, I didn't try to guess. But it seems reasonably straightforward that the new partnership will address the needs of a cohort of potential users who wanted a unified HCM/ERP platform. Just how large that potential is and how successful it might be penetrated with this new platform is hard to say. But the auguries appear to be in the right corner.Wrapping Up!I think shares of Ultimate Software make sense for longer-term investors who understand the significant premium that must be paid for the combination of mid 20% growth, a significant level of non-GAAP profitability that is on the rise, coupled with consistent performance and great visibility. That is what an investment in Ultimate offers and that is why the shares always seem expensive. It is very hard to find the ultimate entry point - sick pun I realize... I just couldn't help it.ULTI sells basically to the mid-market although its solution has attracted some larger customers as well. Unlike CSOD, which I reviewed the other day, this is a soup to nuts, offering for the mid-market that is a super set of Talent Management. According to many surveys, that is what users want to buy.The company is a cloud software company, and it gets all of its product revenues from customers contracting for its service. It has an admirable 97% retention rate, among the highest in the software space.The company's genesis dating back to its birth many years ago is in the payroll processing market and it still does that. But far more crucial than payroll processing are the attach rates of additional HCM functionality. The attach rates are significant, but there is plenty of runway for growth available. Currently, the company averages $8-10/month per active record (employee). If users bought everything they could now, that number would be $30/month, and the product map looks to bring that number to close to $40 by the end of this year.It is hard to say that anyone has a significant technological advantage in the HCM space. The company's main platform UltiPro ticks all of the boxes for functionality and ease of use. So do the offerings from WDAY and probably MSFT. The real competitive moat, if one might be said to exist, is the ability this company has to retain its customers through a combination of sales effort and customer service.The CEO who is 63 has been there since ULTI was born more than 25 years ago understands his business as well as anyone. Although he is 63-years-old, there are no signs that he will retire any time soon.And I suspect given the valuation ULTI will not be something that appeals to strategic buyers either. On the other hand, ULTI's financial characteristics are those that totally appeal to institutions and they own almost all of the float and insiders own more than 5% of the shares as well. It is always a good feeling to ride a merger, but that isn't going to happen here.The company entered into a rather far-reaching partnership agreement with NetSuite more than a year ago. The agreement has produced a completely integrated HCM/ERP solution for the mid-market that is quite competitive with that emerging class of buyers that want to reevaluate their incumbent stack vendor as they move to the cloud. This could be a significant positive for ULTI over the next few years.If investors understand the parameters of what they are buying, then the odds strongly favor achieving a decent result in owning these shares."

They have been able to grow revenue double digits, while improving profitability.Yet, due to their current size and the competitive environment, Ultimate will have a difficult time accelerating revenue growth. This is important due to high growth expectations.Management is implementing a new mid-market sales team. This sales team is targeting companies with 100 to 500 employees. Yet, the impact of the new sales team will be limited.Despite a decline of 12.3% YTD, Ultimate's stock is overvalued compared to peers. The stock is trading at a similar valuation to faster-growing companies.Ultimate should continue to grow double digits, but investors are expecting a significant acceleration of growth. Significant revenue acceleration shouldn't occur, which will result in the stock underperforming.","The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTI) is a developer of cloud-based human capital management or HCM and payroll solutions. These solutions have enabled Ultimate to grow rapidly over the last several years. From 2009-2013, revenue grew at a CAGR of 20.2%. Management has even been able to accelerate revenue growth during the period. In 2013, revenue grew 23.5% which is a significant improvement over 16.1% in 2010. Ultimate's revenue growth has continued to accelerate in 2014. Revenue grew 25.2% in Q2 and 24.4% in the first half. Management has been able to rapidly grow revenue while also increasing profitability. Since 2009, gross profit margin has increased 4.1 percentage points. Gross margin has experienced a slight improvement but operating and net profit margins have experienced a more significant improvement. Since 2009, operating and net profit margin improved 10.6 and 6.8 percentage points, respectively. Ultimate's strong financial performance has occurred despite slow growth in the payroll outsourcing market and low double digit HCM market growth.Yet, Ultimate's stock will have trouble outperforming due to high investor expectations. Investors are paying a significant premium for Ultimate's stock. Ultimate is trading at a similar valuation to faster-growing peers. In order for the stock to outperform, Ultimate will need to continue to accelerate revenue growth. Yet, they operate in a very competitive market and will need to make significant market share gains. There are 83 HCM cloud-based vendors, according to Apps Run The Cloud. Due to their past success, Ultimate already has the second highest market share behind SAP SE (NYSE:SAP). SAP is the market leader for cloud-based HCM with a 10% market share. Continuing to gain significant market share will be very difficult in such a competitive environment. Ultimate will have a difficult time maintaining their current growth rate let alone accelerating it. In order to help accelerate revenue growth, management has formed a strategic sales team for the mid-market. Unfortunately, the mid-market requires a significant amount of customer growth. The new and current sales teams are too small and will struggle to meaningfully accelerate growth. Due to investors' high expectations and the company's current market position, Ultimate's stock will continue to struggle.Competitors Making Market Share Gains More DifficultGartner estimates the HCM market will reach $10 billion by 2015. Additionally, the global HCM market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 10.05% until 2018, according to TechNavio. The market is expected to grow and continue to shift towards the cloud. According to Gartner, the talent management market segment is expected to be $4.5 billion by 2015 with 75% of solutions cloud-based. The HCM market is growing double digits, but the payroll outsourcing market is growing slower. TechNavio estimates the global payroll outsourcing market will grow at a CAGR of 3.91% until 2018. So far, Ultimate has been able to significantly outpace both these markets. They have accomplished this through rapid market share gains. In their 2013 10k, management writes ""Ultimate had approximately 2,700 customers as of the end of 2013. Based on our redefined target markets and on January 2014 market data from Hoover's/Dun & Bradstreet, we estimate our approximate market share to be 8 percent for enterprise companies, those with more than 1,500 employees, and 6 percent for mid-market companies, those with 500-1,500 employees."" Ultimate's success can be attributed to the shift towards the cloud. The shift has allowed Ultimate to compete and beat several large legacy vendors.On the Q2 conference call, Scott Scherr CEO discussed total competitive wins by competitor ""So Enterprise, first 6 months, ADP, 40%, Ceridian, 14%, Lawson, SAP and Kronos, 5% each, 31% other. In the mid-market, ADP, 43%, Ceridian, 19%, Paychex, 11%, other 27%."" Ultimate has been able to compete and replace several large competitors in the payroll business. The payroll market is growing very slowly and will require a significant amount of market share growth in order to maintain the company's double digit growth. Continuing to gain significant market share will be a very difficult due to their current market position. Additionally as cited above, Ultimate has acquired a significant market share in the HCM market. They have accomplished this through their highly rated products and solid execution. Nucleus Research considers Ultimate one of the leaders in the HCM market. Industry experts and customers appear to agree on the quality of the company's products. On the Q2 conference call, Scott Scherr discussed the results of a recent internal survey ""...84% of our customers responding that they are satisfied or very satisfied with UltiPro. Customer satisfaction was even higher for our customers who attended our Connections Conference this year, with 94% of those respondents saying they are happy with UltiPro."" The internal survey demonstrates customers' high satisfaction. Yet, the company's high retention rate provides more concrete evidences of high customer satisfaction. On the Q2 conference call, Scott Scherr talked about the retention rate ""Our customer retention rate continues to remain above 96% for the trailing 12 months ending June 30, 2014.""Ultimate has clearly performed well. They will need to continue their strong performance but this will be difficult due to the very competitive environment. Ultimate's focus on a balanced approach to growth has resulted in the company lagging behind competitors. Ultimate has been able to compete with Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP) but ADP has still been able to rapidly increase their customer base. ADP has grown their customer base by 6.1% or 37,000 from 2012-2014. In 2013, ADP's revenue grew at 8.1% or $919 million. Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY) has rapidly gain market share. In fiscal 2011, their revenue was $7.3 million and in fiscal 2014 revenue reached $469.0 million. As of January 2014, Workday's customer base was 600. Workday is targeting enterprise customers and reducing Ultimate's addressable market. Cornerstone OnDemand, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSOD) has grown 323.3% from 2010-2013. In 2013, Cornerstone's revenue reached $185.13 million. Cornerstone is also aggressively targeting enterprise customers. Recently, Cornerstone's management decided to create a separate enterprise sales team. Ultimate has benefited from a shift to the cloud but many other competitors have also benefited. The competition's growth is limiting Ultimate's ability to continue to rapidly gain market share.*Last 3 fiscal years' revenue growth.As seen above, Ultimate's competitors are rapidly growing and gaining market share which will make sustaining mid-twenty digit growth very difficult. Additionally, maintaining 25% revenue growth won't be good enough because investors are expecting much faster growth. Despite strong growth and improved profitability, Ultimate's stock is down 12.3% year-to-date. Yet even with the decline, the stock is trading at a similar valuation to companies growing over 35% a year. To meet investors' expectations, management will need to meaningfully accelerate revenue growth. However, management won't be able to meaningfully accelerate growth with their new strategic sales team.Aggressive Mid-Market PushManagement has decided to more aggressively target the midsized market. On the Q2 conference call, Scott Scherr discussed the new strategic sales team ""We have decided to go after the strategic market ourselves rather than formalize a partnership with another company. We define the strategic market space as those companies having 100 to 500 employees..."" Management plans to add 12 new strategic district managers by the end of the quarter. These 12 district managers will be part of a 40 person strategic sales team. The sales team will be formed over the next 24 to 30 months. Management is being more aggressive due to the current market opportunity. Paylocity estimates there were 565,000 U.S. organizations with 20 to 1000 employees in 2010. Ultimate already has a midsized sales team to exploit this opportunity. The midsized sales team has been able to achieve a very high attach rates for several solutions. On the Q2 conference call, Scott Scherr discussed the mid-market attach rate ""Our mid-market team's attach rates were also healthy, with onboarding and time management both at 87%, and recruitment and Performance Management both at 73%."" The strategic team should continue the company's success in the mid-market. Yet due to customer size, the mid-market requires a significant amount of customer growth in order to meaningfully contribute to revenue.As cited above, Ultimate had 2,700 customers by the end of 2013. Management has been able to steadily increase the customer base over the last several years. Ultimate's customer base increased by 100 in 2011, 200 in 2012, and 200 in 2013. The steady increase has result in a significant amount of revenue growth. However, the majority of revenue growth has come from enterprise customers. Ultimate will require a much higher customer growth rate in order for the mid-market to contribute meaningfully to revenue. Why is customer growth so important in the mid-market? Midsized organizations generate less revenue than enterprise organizations. This is due to the smaller number of employee's. With their current 36 person mid-market sales team, Ultimate was able to grow the customer base by a few hundred annually. Yet, Paylocity has a 126 person sales team which was able to grow the customer base by 1,650 or 24%. The increase resulted in $47.8 million of revenue from new customer in fiscal 2014 (ended August 2014). Based on Ultimate's 2013 revenue, $47.8 million would result in revenue growth of nearly 10%. This would represent a significant increase in revenue from the mid-market.Yet, Ultimate would need to greatly outperform Paylocity's much larger sales team in order to grow revenue over 10%. This highly unlikely and very difficult due to their smaller sales team. The full mid-market sales team will be 76 people (40 strategic and 36 original). The full sales team is nearly half the size of Paylocity's sales team. Assuming similar sales execution to Paylocity, the midsized sales team could accelerate revenue growth mid-single digits. This would be very optimistic assumption. Yet, a 5% mid-market contribution could increase total revenue growth to nearly 30%. Yet, investors are expecting mid 30% revenue growth. The mid-market presents a large number of potential customers but Ultimate will need to acquire a significant amount of these customers without a substantial mid-market sales team.Additionally, competitors have been rapidly growing in the mid-market. ADP has gained a significant market share in the mid-market. ADP's HCM solution, Workforce Now (available only 5 years), has 50,000 users as of June 2014. These customers range from as small as 50 employees. As cited above, SAP has a sizeable market share of the cloud-based HCM market. Paylocity has been rapidly gaining customers specially in the mid-market. Ultimate's mid-market push should help boost mid-market revenue but the market isn't as large or open as Paylocity's estimate would suggest. As a result, the strategic team isn't going to be able to meaningfully drive revenue growth. Revenue growth will need to continue to accelerate because of investors' high expectations.High ValuationData: Yahoo Finance-Key StatisticsCloud-based HCM and payroll companies are growing fast. The above peer group's rapid growth hasn't gone unnoticed. They all trade at very high valuations. With the exception of Ultimate, the peer group didn't produce positive net income over the last 12 months. This makes valuation base on earning problematic. In order to establish a relative value, revenue-based metrics can be used. Despite an expensive peer group, Ultimate's stock is still overvalued. The stock is trading at a premium to the faster-growing Cornerstone, based on both EV/Revenue and P/S. Additionally, Ultimate is trading at a similar value compared to Paylocity which is growing much faster. Ultimate is only trading as expected compared to Workday which is trading at a extremely high valuation. Ultimate's stock can't be consider undervalued based on the above peer group. Although, they can be considered relatively overvalued compared to the peer group.The stock is overvalued compared to peers and investors appear to be unwilling to continue to pay higher and higher premiums.ULTI Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsAs seen above, Ultimate's revenue growth has normally resulted in investors paying a higher premium for the stock. Yet, in 2014, investors have significantly deviated from this pattern. Ultimate's stock is overvalued compared to peers and investors aren't as willing to pay ever higher multiples. For the above reasons, Ultimate's stock should continue to struggle despite the company's double digit growth.High ExpectationsUltimate has performed very well over the last few years. Revenue growth has accelerated reaching 24% annually. While revenue has grown, profitability has also significantly improved. Gross, operating, and net profit margins all increased since 2009. Despite a strong financial performance, Ultimate's stock has declined 12.3% year-to-date. Even with the decline, the stock still trades at a similar valuation to faster-growing companies. Investors appear to be anticipating much faster revenue growth from Ultimate. Ultimate has benefited greatly from the shift to the cloud. They are the second-largest cloud-based HCM vendor behind SAP. Yet, due to their current size, Ultimate will have to gain a significant amount of market share in order to drastically outpace the industry's growth. This is highly unlikely due to their current market position and the competitive nature of the payroll and HCM markets.Yet in order to spur growth, management is trying to increase their mid-market sales effort. They have formed a strategic sales team to specially target companies with 100 to 500 employees. However, the company's current size and small sales team will limit the impact of this initiative. Due to mid-market customers' smaller size, Ultimate will need to acquire a significant number of mid-market customers in order to sustainably drive revenue growth. This would require increase customer gains from a few hundred a year to well over a thousand. The rapid increase in the customer base seems highly unlikely due current size of the sales team. Lastly, Ultimate's stock is overvalued compared to faster-growing peers. Ultimate is going to have trouble sustaining its current growth rate let alone accelerating it. Management has delivered strong financial results. However, investors are expecting Ultimate to continue to accelerate revenue growth which is much more difficult due to their size and competitive environment. Ultimate should continue to grow double digits but investor's are expecting too much growth. This will result in the stock underperforming."
3604566,80135,2015-11-26T16:03:08-05:00,Investors' expectations for the HCM industry are driven by the performance of recent past.HCM companies won't be able to match past performance due to limited growth.The Ultimate Software Group is grossly overvalued and is faced with competition and cost pressure.Short sellers can gain 35% or more as the stock retracts.,"Our TakeThe HCM industry is growing and will continue to grow in the coming years. However, investors are ignoring the extent of growth and are paying too much a premium for HCM companies. Top-line growth of high-single digit is expected, which is not enough to justify a 36.4x PE for the industry. The Ultimate Software Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTI) is one of the most overvalued companies in the space given a very high relative multiple without revenue growth to match that. Competition is increasing as large companies try to buy in the HCM market through acquisitions while others add functionality to beef up their offerings. Earnings growth of the past is a difficult comp to match with; declining earnings growth will put off investors in the coming quarters. Insiders and institutional investors already seem uninterested in buying more at current valuation. Fundamentals don't support valuation. Therefore, ULTI is a strong candidate for a short sell.About The CompanyULTI is a technology company that belongs to the industry of Internet software and services. The company is a leading human capital management provider offering comprehensive HCM solutions through its UltiPro software. UltiPro includes integrated core HR/payroll, talent, time and labor management solutions delivered through a SaaS model. The company also added predictive analytics capabilities to its platform recently. The company has around 2,800 customers in 160 countries.The company generated $505.9 million in revenue during the year ended 2014, capturing 7% market share. All of the company's revenue comes from subscription and services related to its UltiPro software. The company has maintained an above-20%-top-line growth during the past three years. UltiPro is targeting $1 billion in revenue by 2018. The company has almost phased out its licensing model with a subscription-based revenue model.Source: SEC filingsIndustry ProspectsThe human capital management, or HCM industry, is booming. Thanks to the adoption of cloud, integration of HR services and the increasing focus on talent management, corporations are spending a high percentage of their resources on HCM capabilities. HCM spending is evident from the growth of related software companies. Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY), an HCM company, increased its revenue at an impressive 69% p.a. during the last two years. Ultimate's revenue also grew by more than 20% each year during the last couple of years. All in all, the HCM industry is witnessing growth.Looking forward, high-single-digit growth is also expected in the industry. A report from MarketsandMarkets projects the HCM market to reach $17.49 billion by 2019, translating into a CAGR of 9.8% during the period.Source: MarketsandMarketsResearch from IDC and Forrester also indicate that HCM market is set to grow. Core HR, heritage of ULTI, is expected to grow from $6.1 billion in 2015 to $7.7 billion in 2018. The overall HCM market is expected to reach $15.4 billion by 2019, in accord with IDC and Forrester.Source: IDC ForresterApps Run The World estimates that the cloud subscriptions of worldwide HCM market will grow at a CAGR of 10.40% during 2014-2019. Gartner is also bullish on HCM, especially the SaaS market. In its own words:Source: GartnerSo, it's established that the industry will witness a high-single-digit growth during the next five years with SaaS-based offerings growing at a slightly higher rate; Gartner predicted 15% CAGR for SaaS HCM during 2015-2019. Further, the market will reach a total of around $17 billion-18 billion by 2020.If things are so rosy for the industry, why should anyone have a bearish view of the industry or The Ultimate Software? Well, the industry is witnessing growth, but the companies in the industry are grossly overvalued. Moreover, the industry supports a top-line growth of 10-15% during the next few years while the companies have been enjoying a much higher growth rate during the past few years. Consequently, a decline in top-line growth in coming quarters will be catalytic for the stock price depreciation of the companies in the industry. Ultimate Software has been growing at 20% for eternity. A decline in revenue growth, as evident from the aforementioned future projections, doesn't bode well for the stock price.Back to the industry, it's overvalued in the first place. The industry is expected to reach $17 billion to $18 billion by 2019. The companies playing in the market are valued at more than that. See the table below:The top three companies command 27% of the market and are valued at $24.31 billion now for the market that is expected to reach $18 billion by 2019. Even if these three companies share 100% of HCM revenue between them, which isn't possible, their addressable market still lags behind the market value tagged to them. Given crowded competition in the industry, it isn't possible for these companies to capture 100% market share.One can argue that ULTI's market cap is low relative to Workday or the total addressable market. But, it should be noted that Ultimate Software focuses on midmarket companies only, not the whole market. Moreover, it's a SaaS play. And, we already noted that SaaS HCM is projected to reach $6.1 billion by 2018. Overall, the industry is in a state of an overvaluation.ThesisOur bearish view of The Ultimate Software Group stems from the following analysis:The competitive landscape is crowded with many players including leaders; Ultimate Software is not a clear leader. There are many solution providers that have comprehensive HCM offerings. Large companies are also competing in the space through acquisitions. SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) acquired SuccessFactors to compete in the market. In reaction, Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) acquired Taleo. Ultimate Software will find it difficult to compete with these companies given their scale and resources. Note that SAP Employee Central for Core HR doubled its customers in 2014. SAP ERP/HCM has 14,000 clients while Oracle has around 7,000 cloud HCM clients.There are other strong companies challenging ULTI including Workday and Ceridian. Ultimate Software lags behind Workday in terms of market share. Further, Workday has been growing its revenue at a much faster rate than Ultimate Software during the past few years. This is indicative of Workday's product differentiation. Ceridian recently surpassed UltiPro in terms of functionality, according to Nucleus Research. See the chart below:Source: Nucleus ResearchAccording to Forrester, Ultimate Software is the third best option after Workday and SuccessFactors. Both SuccessFactors and Workday are ahead of Ultimate Software in terms of product offerings and strategy. Even in Core HR, UltiPro lags behind the other two companies.Source: Forrester Wave, SaaS HR Management SystemsForester further adds that Workday is witnessing strong traction among large enterprises. We know that Ultimate targets middle-market companies and is also known for moderate pricing. This doesn't favor Ultimate's bull case. Given a lofty relative valuation of the company, low pricing and concentrated market are among the last things Ultimate Software needs. What's more interesting is that Ultimate Software was a leader in Forrester Wave in 2008. Other companies have come a long way to beat ULTI in terms of offerings and strategy. See the chart below:Source: Forrester ResearchIn talent management, that is the fastest growing HCM segment, SuccessFactors is a leader, according to Forrester Research. Further, Ultimate Software uses a partner solution, Infor, for learning management in integrated talent management. SuccessFactors is also a leader in this space while Ultimate's partner isn't in the list of leaders.Given the increase in number of players and their capabilities, ULTI won't enjoy the same growth as compared to the company's growth during the past few years.Bottom-line growth during the past years creates difficult comps. Declining income growth will lead to the deterioration of the stock price. Much of the growth in the ULTI's stock price is due to the impressive earnings growth during the past few years. GAAP EPS of the company increased 69% in 2012 and 72% in 2014. Earnings growth led to strong rallies resulting in a lofty valuation for the company.Earnings will remain under pressure amid high OPEX. ULTI's SG&A and marketing expenses are growing at a faster rate compared to revenue, which will be problematic for earnings growth going forward. During the first half of 2015, revenue increased 20% while sales & marketing and G&A expenses increased 37% and 54%, respectively.The company also compensates its employees with stock-based compensation. This will also have a dilutive effect on EPS in coming years. Non-cash stock based compensation for the first half of 2015 amounted to $37.85 million, or 12% of the revenue. On an annualized basis, this can have a 1.5% dilutive effect for the shareholders.Now, going forward, matching EPS growth of above 30% isn't possible for ULTI given the single-digit growth of the industry. Analysts are still optimistic and expect earnings growth to be around 22% during the next five years. Even with earnings growth of 22%, ULTI is priced high; the stock trades at a PE of around 63. The stock price will come down in the coming quarters as investors get used to less astronomical earnings growth enabled by competition, low top-line growth, high expense growth and dilution.High proportion of institutional holding at rich valuation doesn't bode well for investors; insider activity in the last six months isn't petty. As the stock is trading at quite high a valuation, stock dump from large holders can result in excess supply leading to stock price decline. According to Evercore ISI, ""We struggle to find material upside in the stock given the current valuation (6.6 times enterprise value/estimated calendar 2016 sales)."" And this was noted by the firm when the stock was trading around $165. The point is that it's getting difficult for institutional investors to hold onto Ultimate Software given high valuation. And it's evident from the fact the no institutional purchases were made during the quarter; 0.38% of institutional holdings were sold during the quarter. Further, no insider bought shares during the last six months. In fact, 9.1% of the shares held by the insiders were sold during the last six months. All in all, institutional and insider transactions are pointing towards a price reversal going forward.Product reviews are fair but others have outperformed UltiPro on several instances. According to TrustRadius' comparison, Workday is ahead of UltiPro in 7 out of 9 features. See the chart below:Source: TrustRadiusFinances.com also rates Workday higher in comparison to UltiPro. The website gives UltiPro a score of 8.6 while Workday managed to get a score of 9.5. The website also favors SuccessFactors over UltiPro. See the comparison below:Source: reviews.financesonlineAnother challenge for Ultimate Software includes the lack of product diversification; the company generates all of its revenue from a single software, UltiPro. Lack of diversification makes the company a very risk bet for long-term investment as the industry is rapidly evolving.Valuation And Final ThoughtsThis is where it gets more interesting. Not a single valuation metric can justify Ultimate Software Group's current valuation. We used a combination of valuation metrics including PE, EVA and cash-flow-based valuation to value the company.For starters, the company trades at a forward PE of 63 while earnings are expected to grow at 22% p.a. during the next five years. This is the first indication that the growth offered by ULTI is quite expensive. Let's try and value ULTI on a PE-based relative valuation methodology:Earnings are projected at 25% p.a. until 2020. A discounted PE-based method is used to value the company. A multiplier of 22 is used to reflect that the company will continue to grow at 22%. Even without discounting, the stock is overpriced by around 8%.EVA-based valuation reveals the same result. Assumptions for the EVA-based valuation include the following:Focus Equity EstimatesEarnings are expected to grow at a CAGR of 25% as compared to the analysts' expectation of 22.5%. The price target indicates that the stock is extremely overpriced. Even if we assume 5% terminal growth in perpetuity, which is essentially 20% p.a. earnings growth during 2020-2025 and 3% earnings growth beyond that, the price target in the EVA model becomes $132. All in all, EVA reveals severe overvaluation of ULTI.DCF-based cash flow approach also indicates that the stock is overpriced:Focus Equity EstimatesThe valuation is based on 30% p.a. growth in operating cash flow during the next five years. Outstanding shares are also assumed to increase 1.5% p.a. during the next five years. Also, 5% growth in perpetuity is a very optimistic assumption. Despite lofty assumption, the price target fails to reach the current price.Let's take the company's target to derive a valuation multiple. ULTI is eyeing $1 billion in revenue by 2018. Let's assume that the company's net income margin comes around 15%. Note that the net income margin of the company was 7.08% during the trailing twelve months. Anyhow, see the table below:To review, not a single valuation method reveals any upside. The stock is trading at an all-time high with an extremely high valuation multiple. As conventional wisdom tells us, multiples return towards mean over time, and we should buy low and sell high, and we should eliminate greed from the equation during high market times; this seems to be the perfect time to sell ULTI, or better, short it.Upside is limited amid increased competition due to multiple leading players, less rosy earnings expectations going forward, insider and institutional reluctance to purchase the stock and no developments to justify or expand current valuation multiples. We believe that the stock will trend downwards in coming quarters as the company will fail to meet the tough comps of the past quarters; OPEX increase will add to the earnings pressure. Nonetheless, current valuation can't be justified on any level. Therefore, we rate ULTI a short-sell.Key Takeaways"

At the moment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is at 18 cents per share.On July 31, 2012, Ultimate Software Group announced second-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of 9 cents, up 200.0% from the year-ago quarter and ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.5%.Revenue grew 23.3% year over year to $79.2 million, driven by new client increases and steady contribution from existing clients (the customer retention rate was more than 96%).

Ultimate Software is also trading at a P/S and P/B of 9.14x and 26.38x, respectively, representing a premium of 168.0% and 440.6% from the peer group averages.Chart Shows Growth PotentialThe 12-month EPS chart clearly shows that both share prices and earnings have trended upward over the last few years. The current momentum appears to be driven by the growing client base and price increases, which are reflected in estimate growth trends.Currently, the share price is hovering around $90.00. The consensus estimates for 2012 and 2013 are trending upward. The estimate revision graph indicates a steep rising trend through fiscal 2015.

3227616,76785,2015-06-01T15:01:58-04:00,Revenue growth running in excess of 20% a year.High customer retention yields predictable revenue streams.Firmly profitable company with a great suite of products makes the company attractive.,"Ultimate Software (NASDAQ:ULTI) offers solutions in human capital management. What this industry jargon means is that the company's suite of products (UltiPro) combines human resources, payroll, and benefits management into one internal system. This gives customers an opportunity to have many core functions such as human resource management, payroll, employee performance and tracking, and benefits held through one common system, all with a built-in reporting system to help interpret a treasure trove of available data. Based off of this data, customers can run reports to generate reports and even help predict employee behavior. The idea is at its core, this product suite helps the company's customers to streamline costs and improve functionality. What the company is doing is obviously working - the company's retention rate stood at 96% in 2014, giving the company a stable, highly predictable revenue stream.One would expect this type of software to be primarily marketed primarily to large companies only, but Ultimate Software has done a great job of paring down offerings to make their products cost effective for smaller companies while still being attractive. The company even offers services like cloud storage and installation and maintenance packages to help smaller companies that do not have dedicated IT teams.Revenue Growth and CostsTop-line growth has been wonderful here, and the company has seen some gross margin improvement over this timeframe as well as the customer base has expanded. This is all internal, organic growth done the old fashioned way. You won't find growth being generated here from acquisitions or debt. If there would be one area of light concern, it is SG&A's growing cost share. Labor costs have risen for the company through higher base salaries and higher commissions. This is just a symptom of the broad demand needed for experienced workers in this industry - I'd prefer the company do what it needs to do to retain top talent through being a top choice for employment.RiskThe number one risk here is that buy buying Ultimate Solutions you are buying the UltiPro suite. All their revenue stems from this one product. You can picture it being akin to buying Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) if their only product was Microsoft Office. If the company fails to continue to develop and enrich this product, share price will be under immense pressure. If the company falls victim to cyber-attack or has some other security issue, any customers lost will be difficult to win back due to the sticky nature of contracts in this business. High switching costs make jumping between providers difficult, so once a customer is gone they are likely gone for good. On the bright side, the company does not derive revenue from only a few major customers (the company had over 2,800 customers at the end of 2014) and has broad diversification among industries from finance to healthcare, which balances out a lot of risk of being exposed to just one particular fragment of the overall economy.Investors should also remember that this is a smaller company competing against much larger firms with deep pockets: firms like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and ADP (NASDAQ:ADP). Companies like these have a lot more cash that they can sink into competing with smaller companies like Ultimate Software.A frequent topic of conversation, particularly within technology, is stock based compensation. Ultimate Software's non-GAAP EPS numbers back this expense out. Analysts disagree on the fairness of this treatment. What Ultimate Software does do, directly contrary to a lot of high flying firms, is offset this dilution by buying back shares with free cash flow. Diluted shares outstanding has remained relatively flat as a result. I'm more apt to buy into using non-GAAP EPS for companies like Ultimate Software that make an effort to not dilute the common stock shareholder.ValuationMost concern with investors here is the valuation. With a 2014 non-GAAP EPS of $2.11/share (backing out stock-based compensation and intangible amortization), shares trade extremely expensively compared to the rest of the market. I expect revenues of $620M and $750M in 2015 and 2016 respectively (continued 20% top-line growth), which will lead to non-GAAP EPS of $2.47/share in 2015 and $3.10/share in 2016 assuming continuation of current trends. This puts the shares closer to a reasonable realm. If you're a shareholder here, you're hoping that Ultimate Software continues to grow at a quick pace.ConclusionThere is a lot of junk in the SaaS space that I wouldn't touch. This isn't one of them. The company is solidly profitable. There isn't a heavy debt burden issue. The company builds and creates a highly regarded and wonderful product. While I'm not a current shareholder, this is definitely a company I would keep an eye on and if you are long, a great long-term hold. At under $150/share, I would become deeply interested in adding a position."
1649222,37531,2013-08-21T11:55:48-04:00,,"Executive SummaryUltimate Software (NASDAQ:ULTI) has shown consistent growth in last five years with CAGR of 25%. The company has been gaining market share from the traditional software vendors in HCM segment. Currently, the company caters to a small volume in the HCM segment, but it is gaining a lot of customer attention due to its superior service and its order book is brimming. I see the company continuing its growth momentum in the coming years, as the HCM market is expected to grow from $8 billion in 2012 to $11 billion by 2016 and SaaS is expected to account for three-fourth of the incremental business.Company OverviewUltimate Software Group is a provider of cloud based Human Capital Management (NASDAQ:HCM) system. The company currently provides its solutions to organizations based in the US and Canada. The company's core software- UltiPro has two versions: Enterprise and Workplace. UltiPro Enterprise is designed to address the needs of an organization with more than 1,000 employees while UltiPro Workplace is designed for organizations with less than 1,000 employees. The company derives its revenue mainly from recurring business; its other line of business is services and license. The company's ease of deployment and low cost of ownership of its product has helped the company retain its existing customers. The company's customer retention percentage of 96% provides good visibility about its future revenue.Ultimate Software Group's line of BusinessGrowth DriversUltimate has a two-fold strategy to grow; one is to increase revenue from the existing customer base via new products, and the other is to gain market share at the expense of legacy software vendors.Market Share Win: Its not just about the cost savings from SaaSThe company is gaining market share at the expense of ADP and Ceridian. Approximately 56% and 71% customers within Enterprise and Workplace respectively have switched to Ultimate from either ADP or Ceridian.One of the reason for Ultimate's market share win is the potential cost savings from the SaaS platform which is less capital intensive than in-house solutions. However, one should note that both ADP and Ceridian have launched their SaaS offerings, but the competitive environment has not changed and Ultimate is still gaining market share at the expense of these two companies.The main reason for customers shifting to Ultimate is its easy to deploy product and better customer service. Lack of customer service, and the problems in using combinations of disparate and non-integrated systems have lead to issues about data quality and flexibility in competitors products. On the other hand, Ultimate provides a broad offering covering payroll management, performance management, time and labor, performance management, HRIS and recruitment which are easy to use.Competitive LandscapeSource: Ultimate SoftwareNew products and Capacity expansion will help sustain growthIn addition to gaining new customers, Ultimate has also done a good job in terms of increasing revenues from existing customers. In 2002, Ultimate used to earn an average revenue of $5 per employee per month (employee here refers to customer's employee). This number has now gone upto $26 helped by new product launches and cross selling.Going forward, the company plans to release its new recruiting module in the first half of financial year 2014, which comes at a higher price point. In 2014, Workplace will target organizations having 1,500 employees, against 1,000 employees ones being targeted currently. The company invested in two modules in the area of global tracking and analytics. The company currently has data for ~10 million employees, which it can analyze and develop an algorithm. This will help the organizations do prior planning. Development of these products will help the company increase the number of its clients and also enable it to cross sell its products to its existing customers. This will increase the revenue per customer and also improve margin in the coming time. Currently, the company has revenue of $26 per employee per month; with these initiatives the company can increase its revenue to $ 30-32 per employee per month.Ultimate also plans to continue growing its quota carrying representative (QCR) by 9%-14% year-on-year in financial year 2013. In addition to this, the company has plans to expand its internal sales head count from nine to twenty three by the end of 2013. This will increase the number of internal sales representative to one for three QCR. This will give the company increased opportunity in both Workforce and Enterprise, thereby increasing the productivity of QCR.Market Metrics points toward topline acceleration in the near termAccording to the company, the marketing metrics for second quarter 2013 indicate strong interest in its solutions. In the last quarter, the company witnessed a 28% yoy increase in inquiries from prospective customers looking forward to purchase its solutions in 12 months or less. The number of opportunities uncovered by the company's inside sales team was up 25% over 2012's Q2. The customer reference metric also remained strong and according to the company, more than 80% of its customers said they would recommend UltiPro to a colleague.The companies revenues were up 23% yoy in the second quarter. If we look at 28% increase in enquiries which is an indicator of future growth, it appears that the company's topline may accelerate over the next few quarters which may act as a catalyst for the stock.Long term Prospects remain goodThe company's market share is ~11% for companies with more than 1,000 employees and ~3% for companies in the 200-1,000 employees band. This indicates that the company has huge untapped market and can continue its growth trajectory for next several years.The company's management has given a revenue target of $600 million by 2015. The revenue CAGR for the company has been 23% in last four years. The company's client retention rate is ~96% and the revenue from recurring business has been growing at 25% CAGR. Even if we do not assume any acceleration in topline growth rate from improving job market, new product launches and capacity expansion; the company will easily surpass its revenue target.Gross Margin and Operating Margin will improve due to high recurring revenueThe company's gross margin and operating margin has shown steady growth in the past several years due to the high margin recurring revenue. The margin will improve further in the coming year as the cost associated with recurring revenue will come down. In the long term, the company is likely to achieve non GAAP operating margin in mid-thirties as growth slows down and investment spending tapers off.Job growth improvement will increase the top/bottom lineThe company operates on per employee per month fee basis. So the topline and bottom line are correlated with the employment scenario in the economy. The improving macro-economic condition in the US region and the declining unemployment rate are likely to serve as a tailwind for the company's topline. Also as the incremental cost of serving the additional employee is very less, most of the incremental revenue will directly percolate to the bottom line of the company.Domestic and International ExpansionThe company is currently focused on gaining market share in the US and Canadian markets. According to the company, it currently has a share of around 3-4% of the total potential market in these countries. The company has plans to increase its share in the market to ~10% in the next few year.In addition to these two countries, the company also has a good potential to expand its services in internationally. The company, in order to expand its offering in other countries is localizing its products by offering them in local languages. I expect this will help the company increase its footprint in other countries in the longer term.ValuationThe company is currently trading at 9x EV/Sales on annualised second quarter revenues, a relative premium to the total SaaS group average. I believe the company deserves a premium given if highly defensive recurring revenue stream and superior product and services. Also if we look at high growth SaaS companies, most of them are trading between 9x-17x EV/Sales. The company is trading at lower end of this band and given the potential acceleration in sales growth (as pointed above in marketing metrics section), the company may see its EV/Sales multiple improve.ConclusionUltimate Software has shown steady growth in its revenue and margins. It has 96% retention rate of its customers and 83% of its revenue is recurring. This gives it a good topline visibility. The company has been able to gain market share from the incumbent legacy software vendors. The company appears set to deliver a fifth consecutive year of 25% or greater recurring revenue growth coupled with margin expansion. The company's future looks robust with lot of big deals in the pipeline. The company has invested in R&D and sales force strengthening, which auger well for the future. Given the future growth potential for the company I am bullish on this company's stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

At roughly 2,800 customers as of November 2015 and $583M in trailing twelve months' revenue, Ultimate Software generates about $210k in average revenue per customer, which implies revenue skews toward the enterprise part of the market.The company's financials are available for 20 years and show the progression of a company with $4M in revenue to more than $583M. Over that time period, the business has grown 28% per year on average, steadily becoming one of the largest SaaS companies in the world. Among publicly-traded human capital management software vendors, Ultimate Software is second to Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY).Since 2004, Ultimate Software has generated positive cash flow. The business went public in 1998 forecasting cash flow break-even within two years.Ultimate Software ran mostly unprofitable through 2005 and has a strong history of operating with positive profits for the last six years.The median publicly-traded SaaS company operates with 71% gross margins. ULTI has averaged about 60% of late. This figure is depressed by professional services revenue which represents about 20% of revenue and is run at 0% gross margin. However, professional services' contribution to revenue has fallen from 32% in 2010 to about 20%, likely because ULTI is moving into the mid-market and the product has improved, so less service is required to satisfy customer needs. This decline in professional services revenue as a fraction of total revenue has boosted overall margin.Ultimate Software spends about 25% of revenue on sales and marketing, which is half of the publicly-traded median of software companies, and it is growing at roughly the same rate as companies of its age - about 23% annually.The company's sales efficiency has varied quite a bit over the past 20 years, but has exceeded 1.0 only once - during the year of the IPO. On average, the company generates about $0.44 of gross margin per sales and marketing dollar invested. In part, the relatively lower gross margin contributes to this figure. In addition, the presumably long sales cycles to win F500 contracts for this critical piece of software weigh some, too.Ultimate Software is right on the median for engineering spend at 16% of revenue.The Ultimate Software Company - name notwithstanding - is a great example of an enduring software company that has thrived for over 20 years with steady growth driven by disciplined investments into growth and product."

260589,23843,2011-03-29T09:25:40-04:00,,"Ultimate Software (NASDAQ:ULTI) prides itself on being wonderful to its employees, and it consistently places highly in “best places to work” surveys. I have no doubt this is true, as a careful reading of the 10-K and some basic analysis reveals that all of the economic profits from ULTI's business accure to its employees, leaving nothing left for the actual shareholder owners of the company. In my opinion ULTI's valuation and share price performance is a testament to just how speculative and disconnected from economic reality today's tech stock market is.Whether or not stock-based compensation should be counted as an expense has long been a source of controversy among Wall St. observers. While any thinking business owner recognizes that employee compensation is a real cost no matter what form it takes, tech companies in particular enjoyed being able to richly pay their employees without recognizing any expense.Wall St. and corporate America fought the FASB’s attempts to require stock-based compensation to be recognized as an expense tooth and nail. As Warren Buffet observed in 1998:FAS 123 was finally adopted at the end of 2004 against howls of protest. To blunt its effects, many companies began issuing “pro forma” results which simply ignored stock-based compensation, and Wall St. analysts dutifully followed suit. At first this made some sense, as prior-year comparisons would have been muddled by the change in accounting standards. I would also point out that the real value of stock options is difficult to estimate, since their actual cost can either end up being nil or enormous depending on the subsequent performance of the stock. Thus they are meant to be a bonus contingent on value creation.However, as the years march on many tech companies continue to train their Wall St. analysts to look past all stock compensation expense. ULTI represents an extreme of this practice.In 2010 ULTI reported $0.11 in diluted GAAP EPS from continuing operations on a meager 4% operating margin. That's not a lot of earnings for a $60 stock. In order to make the stock seem more attractive to investors, management has convinced Wall St. analysts to focus on its non-GAAP (i.e. excluding stock compensation expense) 2010 EPS of $0.48 per share, giving ULTI a multiple of “only” 125x trailing and 83x 2011 estimated non-GAAP EPS.However, ULTI’s non-GAAP earnings ignore significant, real expenses borne by its shareholders. ULTI no longer gives out employee stock options, rather grants restricted stock and restricted stock units. Importantly, employees receive their restricted shares upon vesting and can sell them for cash no matter whether the stock goes up or down. This means that shareholder dilution is inevitable.In 2010, ULTI granted 166,000 restricted shares at a fair value of $40.51 and 200,000 restricted stock units, presumably around the same price. This is nearly $15M of stock given out to employees (more at today’s prices) and more than 100% of 2010's $12.8M of non-GAAP net income according to the company's press release. In other words, ULTI essentially earns no economic profits for shareholders. These shares have real cash value. But somehow, as long as ULTI pays employees in stock grants instead of cash, we are supposed to believe it isn’t a real expense. The 10-K description of the restricted stock units even indicates that the award can be paid by the company in cash instead of stock on the vesting date!There is another way of illustrating the same point.  In 2010, ULTI reported net cash provided by operating activities of $25.4 million and capital expenditures of $5M for free cash flow of $20.4M. At today’s enterprise value, the stock trades for almost 70x trailing free cash flow, which is quite expensive by just about any standard. However, the company spent nearly all of this cash ($19.8M to be exact) to buy back 610,000 shares at an average of little more than half of the current price. At the same time, basic shares outstanding went from 24.5M to 25M in 2010. In other words, despite plowing 100% of the cash it generated back into buying shares at much lower prices than today, ULTI’s shareholders still experienced dilution. As of the March filing of its 2010 10-K ULTI’s basic shares outstanding were up even further to 25.6M.ULTI treats its employees very well and their software appears to provide real value for at least some modest sub-set of American businesses. However, I think that investors and analysts are foolish to take management's suggestion of focusing on non-GAAP earnings that ignore substantial compensation paid to ULTI employees simply because it is in shares instead of cash. If the company decided to pay all of its expenses in stock, would analysts dutifully model 100% operating margins?I also find the  great share price performance amazing given the fact that even the analysts’ non-GAAP earnings estimates for 2011 have been reduced over the last year. The Wall St. analysts whose reports I see justify their bullish price targets by comparing ULTI's revenue multiple to SAAS market darlings like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and SuccessFactors (NYSE:SFSF), despite their drastically lower deferred revenue growth, 14% in 2010 vs. 33% and 29%, respectively.But there are indications that ULTI management may also be surprised at the valuation its business has achieved. At conferences, they have announced they are going to “build cash” instead of continuing to plow what meager cash flow they earn into stock buybacks. According to January rumors ULTI attempted to sell itself in the early part of the year. But apparently either the rumors were false or no one would pay a sufficient premium to its stock price (about $50 at the time).Senior executives have been consistent sellers of the stock they grant themselves, while telling Wall St. to ignore the stock expense. The significant non-10b5-1 sales in the February open window indicate the company doesn’t expect a buyout to happen any time soon. Of course, in the current QE2-cloud-computing-speculative melt-up, it's anyone's guess where the share price will go.Disclosure: I am short ULTI.Additional disclosure: No position in CRM or SFSF"
245848,22829,2011-01-11T02:01:17-05:00,,"By Brenon DalyAfter 20 years in business, Ultimate Software (NASDAQ:ULTI) may be looking for a new owner. The human capital management (HCM) vendor is rumored to have retained Lazard to shop the company, market sources have told us. The bank will run a narrow process, likely approaching about a half-dozen possible buyers rather than running a full auction, the sources added.The decision by Ultimate to test the market comes as deal flow in the HCM sector has hit a record level. In 2010, we tallied some $2.4bn in spending on deals, slightly eclipsing the previous record of $2.1bn in 2007, according to our M&A KnowledgeBase. Valuations across the space have been soaring, and Ultimate is no exception. This time last year, shares of the Weston, Florida-based company were changing hands at about $30 each. Now, they’re at $50 – an all-time high. That gives Ultimate a market value of $1.25bn, roughly 4.6 times projected 2011 sales of $270m.Much of the gain can be chalked up to the company’s decision a few years ago to switch from selling software licenses to a subscription model. (It’s a move that has proved incredibly lucrative for other old-line software companies, as well. Shares of Concur Technologies (NASDAQ:CNQR), which underwent a similar shift in sales model a few years ago, have quadrupled over the past five years and are now valued at $2.8bn.) Ultimate stopped selling new software licenses in April 2009 and recurring revenue (made up of both subscription and maintenance revenue) is now more than three-quarters of total sales."

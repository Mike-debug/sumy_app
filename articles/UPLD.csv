Share dilution is high.","Upland Software, Inc. (UPLD) is one of those companies that I dread writing about. With approximately 25 acquisitions in 9 years, this company is really an M&A machine and it doesn't fit with the type of business that I normally analyze. Although I have difficulties analyzing the business, I can't argue with the company's success given the 3-year CAGR of 43%.(Source: Upland Software)Despite the apparent success of this business model, I do have some concerns regarding Upland Software and growth by M&A, in general.I know this may come as a shock to readers, but growth by M&A doesn't come for free. Upland Software's debt level and debt to equity ratio have been rising as companies are acquired.(Source: Portfolio123)At some point in time, the M&A activity has to slow down or share dilution has to increase. I should point out that this company does have a fairly high level of share dilution already, on the order of 17% YoY.(Source: Portfolio123)Although company management is making acquisitions based on fit within certain product suites, I believe that there are too many acquired companies and a lack of focus on the development of core software applications, despite the company's claims to the contrary.(Source: Upland Software)The organic growth is only 6% despite the massive number of products in the Upland Software portfolio. I'm not seeing the big picture here.In my opinion, Upland Software stock is extremely undervalued at present. And the company has some positive fundamental factors such as positive free cash flow, growing gross margin, and reasonable cash burn. However, I am torn by the business model. I believe that the high level of M&A activity is leading to a scattered product portfolio without a lot of synergy between applications. And I also believe that the M&A activity will have to slow or share dilution will become more apparent. For these reasons, I am giving Upland Software a neutral rating.Upland Software has acquired six companies since the start of 2019. These include:According to the company management:Having been an engineer in a previous lifetime, I can say with some certainty that acquiring companies at this pace is chaotic and will not likely lead to a cohesive product suite. The sales team will end up with a massive portfolio of applications to sell, but the apps won't look and act similarly. Cross-selling won't be easy and the low organic growth rate of 6% is evidence that I am right.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth ones. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated Y-o-Y sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated Y-o-Y sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Upland Software is well below the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is very undervalued relative to its peers given the estimated future revenue growth rate.While I am giving Upland Software a neutral rating primarily due to the business model which I believe leads to a scattered set of products, there are some positive aspects of this company that readers should be aware of. These include positive free cash flow, growing gross profit margin, and a good SG&A expense margin.The free cash flow margin is approximately 3% and has been positive since mid-2017.(Source: Portfolio123)The gross profit margin is ~73% and has been steadily climbing since 2015.(Source: Portfolio123)The SG&A expense margin is 49%, a very good figure that is typically seen only in relatively mature companies.(Source: Portfolio123)Upland Software is a company that grows by M&A. Its 3-year CAGR is 43%. Apart from the high level of revenue growth, this company has a good level of cash burn, positive free cash flow and steadily climbing gross margin. In my opinion, the stock is also extremely undervalued.Despite the positive factors for this stock, I believe that the business model needs to change for the long term. Company management needs to focus on cohesiveness and synergy within the product families and curtail the M&A activities. They have more than enough product areas and I would argue that they are spread too thin for the size of the company. The evidence is in the low organic growth of 6%. When this number starts to rise and M&A activity slows then I will consider revising my neutral rating."

Notably, its biggest negative miss was the most recent reporting period:Source: Seeking AlphaBelow is a table of relevant capitalization and valuation figures for the company:Source: Company FinancialsBelow is an estimated DCF (Discounted Cash Flow) analysis of the firm’s projected growth and earnings:Assuming the above generous DCF parameters, including EPS of $2.00, the firm’s shares would be essentially fully valued at their current level.UPLD acquired Localytics to add mobile personalization technologies to its Customer Experience Management system [CXM].As Upland Chairman and CEO Jack McDonald stated in the deal announcement,The point of Localytics’ technology is to help clients convert at a higher rate across all points of interaction, whether it’s messaging, apps, email or web.Demand for mobile application analytics is forecast to grow at a rapid rate over the next few years as enterprises demand more capabilities, so Upland is right to incorporate Localytics’ tech into its platform.While the deal won’t move UPLD in the near term, management continues to be on a path of acquiring firms to build out its cloud offerings, so I expect more deals like the current one.However, based on a generous hypothetical earnings per share of $2.00 and a 10-year growth rate of an average of 12%, the shares would be essentially fully valued at their current level.Upland is growing revenue smartly and through acquisition but management will need to make a decisive turn to positive earnings to generate a significant upward catalyst for the stock, so my bias is currently NEUTRAL."
4291397,104952,2019-09-13T10:37:33-04:00,Upland Software uniquely grows through M&As rather than through in-house product development. It has acquired 22 companies in 9 years.It sources cash-generating small-cap software M&A deals in a niche enterprise space in a similar way to software-focused venture capital firms.Its M&A focus growth strategy allows Upland Software to stay on the edge of innovation and to grow its business with a lower risk of getting disrupted.,"As venture investors, we take a particular interest in evaluating early-stage investment opportunities in software companies. Similarly, since it started, Upland Software's (UPLD) main growth strategy has been to acquire technology ventures operating in niche markets that can provide a strategic value-add to its enterprise work management suite. Having done so consistently over the years, Upland Software has acquired the expertise and knowledge to stay on the edge of innovation and to grow its business with a lower risk of getting disrupted. Overall, that is why we think that Upland Software is an interesting opportunity. It made its first acquisition in 2012 when it acquired PowerSteering, a project portfolio management software. Most recently in 2019, it acquired Kapost, an operations platform for sales and marketing, and an email marketing company, PostUp. Over nine years of its operating history, Upland Software has successfully acquired 22 companies, which we think is quite an achievement for a company with a market cap of just a little under $1 billion. Upland Software IPO'd in 2014, and its share price has roughly tripled since then.In a nutshell, Upland Software wants to provide an enterprise work management suite. This includes anything from customer experience and document automation to knowledge management solution. Through its seven areas of focus, Upland Software has acquired over 1 million users with over 9,000 accounts.Source: Upland Software DatasheetWhat we found to be interesting in Upland Software’s overall business strategy is its M&A-oriented growth approach. Most of its acquisition targets are smaller software companies building niche solutions that could potentially complement its existing software applications. In that sense, Upland Software needs to be able to identify and source strategic M&A targets in a similar way a venture capital investor sources potential investment deals. As per its 10-K:We think that this approach enables Upland Software to grow with a small chance of getting disrupted, because product-wise, it can always maintain its differentiation through a series of niche acquisitions. Source: stockrow. Upland’s key financial metricsFinancially, we see the evidence that Upland’s strategy to boost its growth through M&A has been working very well. Its trailing annual revenue growth has trended upwards and has stabilized in between the 45% to 51% range over the last few years. To us, this shows that Upland Software has been strengthening and optimizing its approach in sourcing for micro-cap M&A deals and post M&A integrations.Since its IPO in 2014, its annual revenue has increased by more than twice as much. In FY 2018, Upland Software’s revenue was $149.9 million. Since the start of FY 2019, it has been on track to deliver $220 million in annual revenue, in which 92% of it is recurring. Bottom line-wise, Upland software has never been profitable, though its annual net loss margin is quite consistent and well managed. Its net loss margin has improved significantly from -33.5% at the lowest point in FY 2014, to -7.2% in FY 2018. Source: Upland Software’s 10-QBased on our observation on its financials as of Q2 2019, we also saw how Upland Software was close enough to achieving operating profitability. With a gross profit margin of 69% in Q2 2019 and 70% in Q2 2018, Upland Software could turn profitable if it could reduce its operating expenses by as much as it spent for M&A-related expenses. Hypothetically, if it were not for M&A activities, its operating margin in Q2 2019 and Q2 2018 would have been somewhere between 6% to 7% instead of -10% and -2% consecutively. As a result, we get a sense that being unprofitable may be just a matter of choice for Upland Software at the moment.Therefore, we are optimistic that Upland Software is heading towards the best-case scenario where it can achieve both profitabilities while maintaining its growth through M&A sometime in the future. Another key success factor here is the strength of its management team, which the company builds around its thesis of growing through M&As. The key roles in this initiative would be the CEO and CFO, who will both provide strategic M&A direction and access to capital. Upland Software is also one of the few companies that have a specific SPV role focusing on operations and M&A integrations alone. Its datasheet further emphasizes its management’s ability and experience in executing M&A deals:No matter how small it is, there is always a risk of failure in any M&A deal. Also, during the integration phase, M&A always incurs significant expense while carrying another risk in the form of potential conflict between the new and existing management afterward. In terms of expenses, last quarter alone, we learned that Upland Software spent as much as 17% of its $53 million in revenue. Valuation-wise, Upland Software is trading at a significant discount to its peers when it comes to FWD P/E. Its FWD P/E as of 2019 is 14.71, while the sector median is 22.6. Its FWD PEG is also 58% lower than the sector median of 1.78. However, when we look at its other valuation metrics such as FWD P/S, we have learned that Upland Software trades at a 67% premium in comparison to its peers. Overall, when we take into account Upland Software’s ability to achieve a 51% YoY revenue growth and its expectation to consistently grow its future revenue at 34% YoY going forward, we think that it is fairly valued. As we discussed above, Upland Software’s most attractive proposition has been its expertise to maintain its growth by successfully acquiring cash-generating technology ventures operating in a niche enterprise market. To us, that is something that does not come cheap. Upland Software is one of the few enterprise technology companies with a unique growth strategy. Its vision is to build a family of enterprise work management software through a series of M&As of smaller-cap technology ventures. Over time, it has built an expertise in not only sourcing for the most strategic M&A deals but also in integrating the acquired companies to its core operation. Its financials and business fundamentals have both been solid. In the end, we also think that its M&A-focus growth strategy will allow Upland Software to maintain its solid outlook."

The company was established in 2010 and made its first acquisition in 2011, and became public in 2014 with a history of 16 successful acquisitions.It had a great run-up recently, from about $6 (November 2016) to about $32 a few days back. I won't bore you with what UPLD sells - you can see the company's products here. In essence, it is a cloud software company with project management solutions, workflow & documentation solutions, IT management solutions and digital engagement solutions (website management, text campaigns etc.)The juice here is that currently the company was a little short of $100 million of revenue in 2017 with $30 million of adj. EBITDA, and management projects to finish 2018 with a little more than $133 million of revenue and about $47-48 million of adj. EBIDTA. Awesome, right?One of the good things here is that management is not overly promotional. They know that organic growth is tough for their particular products and view it as a side benefit to their overall strategy. Read the following excerpts and you'll get the gist of their attitude about how to grow.And this from Q1 2018 earnings call:As you see, management know their game and are really pragmatic about what their goal is. And the truth is that if they achieve their goal of $250 million revenue and $100 million of adj. EBITDA (or $4.17/share), we are looking at a potential valuation of $1.4 billion (or $58/share) at a reasonable multiple of 14 times adj. EBITDA.So the question is: Can they achieve this, and what are the risks along the way?Let's address the risks first.Fortunately, Upland does not have a debt maturity problem, as you can see below.UPLD's debt maturities as of its latest 10-Q -The risk here is debt availability. If, for whatever reason (increased rates, China implosion, US recession etc.), UPLD fails to secure cheap credit to finance its acquisitions, the whole story is toast.On the good side of this, I have to add that the company's cash flow creation is good at around $7-$8 million, and it is paid upfront by their clients, so UPLD operates with negative working capital, which offers additional protection and liquidity.Management incentives are aligned with those of investors, but more loosely than I would like. Here are the crucial parts from the latest proxy: So far, all seems good, as management has a significant interest in the company.This is my worry here. The executive team is paid based on adj. EBITDA, which they can totally manipulate and are incentivized to keep acquiring EBITDA irrespective of the cost. As long as they buy companies and add revenue, their bonuses will grow irrespective of what they pay for said revenue.However, this table addresses my worries somewhat, as it shows that management further gains to expect down the road if they take care of the company's share price. I recommend that you read the footnotes below the table, though, for a more comprehensive look at how these work.Upland has a clear path towards $58 per share as long as management can secure credit to fuel future acquisitions. The management incentives are not the best but point to the right direction, and management has proven over the past few years that they know how to assimilate acquired companies without much trouble.Good scenario: 85% upside as of writing (at the last close, the stock was at $31.38).Bad scenario: You end up with a 3-5% growth company with a reasonable moat (as all these software-as-a-service companies have) that will be worth about 8-10 times adj. EBITDA. If the company achieves its 2018 goal (which I think it will), this looks like a $400-450 million market cap, or a downside of 33-40%.Personally, I won't buy UPLD shares, as I run a very concentrated portfolio of 5-6 stocks, but I think the risk-reward is very attractive for anyone with a diversified portfolio of more than 20 positions and a 2-3 year horizon.I'd love to discuss this with you further, so if you will, contact me directly or through the comments.Cheers!"
4376591,101801,2020-09-28T08:20:02-04:00,"Today, we take an in-depth look at a fast-growing cloud play called Upland Software.The company has weathered the coronavirus ably, with only 7% of its top line leveraged to the industries hardest hit.With over $200 million in its coffers earmarked for its growth-by-acquisitions strategy, an uptick in organic growth, and recent insider buying, Upland merited a more thorough examination.A full investment analysis follows in the paragraphs below.","Today, we look at a fast-growing ""cloud"" concern for the first time. A full investment analysis follows in the paragraphs below.  Upland Software, Inc. (UPLD) is an Austin, Texas-based provider of enterprise work management software through four cloud-based offerings. Rather than develop IT organically, the company chooses to acquire technology operating in niche markets, racking up 26 acquisitions in the past eight and a half years. Upland was formed in 2010 and made its debut as a publicly traded company in 2014, raising net proceeds of $42.9 million at $12 a share. The stock currently trades right at $37.50 a share, translating to a market cap of ~$1.1 billion.(Source: Company Overview)Product OfferingsUpland Software provides customers with the following cloud-based offerings:(Source: Company Overview)Customer Experience Management Cloud, which allows businesses to manage the customer lifecycle, from awareness to acquisition to multi-channel advocacy via email, text messaging, social media, and mobile apps; Enterprise Sales and Marketing Cloud, which enables sales and marketing organizations to optimize sales activities, digital content production, automate key proposal and references processes, and track key metrics; Project and IT Management Cloud, which permits professional services and IT companies to better manage services delivery, project portfolios, enterprise knowledge sharing and spending across projects and IT/telecom infrastructure; and Document Workflow Cloud, which enables enterprises to manage and automate document-intensive business processes with data security through scan and fax platforms, data monitoring and breach prevention capabilities, and the automated routing of content to its destination. On September 15th, the company announced that its Document Workflow Cloud solutions will be offered within HP Workpath starting by the end of the year.These solution sets are designed to aid the digital transformation of companies, with no re-platforming required, allowing for rapid adoption.(Source: Company Overview)ApproachThe total addressable market for these cloud-based services is greater than $25 billion and growing, aided by a wave of venture capital investment in the cloud, totaling more than $130 billion between 2014 and 2018. The companies birthed by the VC firms become targets for Upland, which looks to add $25-50 million to its top line annually through acquisitions. Acquirees generally have revenues of $5-25 million, a net annual retention rate of at least 90%, 70+% gross margins, average revenue per account > $25,000, and 10+% organic growth. Upland typically pays 5x-8x’s Adj. EBITDA for these upstarts. They are then integrated onto the company’s platform and supported by an ever-expanding direct sales force. The new cloud-based apps provide an opportunity to cross-sell to existing customers while the company’s total customer base increases with each acquisition.Most Recent AcquisitionThe company’s most recent purchase, application analytics concern Localytics, was a little outside its normal parameters. In February 2020, it paid $68 million to acquire a platform employed in over 37,000 apps on more than 2.7 billion devices by companies such as ESPN (DIS), Fox (FOX), and The New York Times. Although the acquisition price was higher than what Upland usually pays, it was in its Adj. EBITDA range at ~7.6x. Localytics will add ~$20 million to the company’s top line and should be immediately accretive to earnings. With only one deal, 2020 has been a slow year for the normally serial acquirer, as it has chosen to stay on the sidelines during the coronavirus pandemic.History of SuccessThrough its strategy of acquiring complementary software businesses, Upland has quickly expanded its product families and grown its customer base to ~10,000 with over 1 million individual users. Revenues have tripled since 2015 to $222.6 million in 2019 - nearly all high-margin subscription-related - while Adj. EBITDA has increased twenty-fold to $82.5 million over the same period. The company has ~1,600 customers who provide annual recurring revenue of $25,000 or more (i.e., “major” accounts) - averaging $160,000 per - and account for ~85% of the company’s sales. No customer represents more than 3% of Upland’s top line, and annual recurring revenue accounts for more than 93% of its business.(Source: Company Overview)Potential ConcernsTo finance its buying spree, Upland has assumed debt and diluted its shareholders. Its debt obligation has risen from $24.9 million at YE15 to $536.0 million as of June 30, 2020, while shares outstanding have increased 75% from 16.8 million at YE15 to 29.4 million after its August 11, 2020 secondary - assuming exercise of the greenshoe - that was priced at $34 per share. Although Adj. EBITDA has increased substantially since the company went public, acquisition-related expenses - Upland’s normal course of business - and stock-based compensation add-backs were responsible for nearly 80% of this metric in 2019. And on a GAAP basis, Upland has never been profitable, with its best year being a loss of $0.54 in 2018. Organic growth, which (admittedly) is not the central thesis of the company’s business model, has been mired in the low to mid-single digits. As such, its approach is not devoid of critics.2Q20 Results and 2020 OutlookOne item that is difficult to argue with is Upland meeting or beating its quarterly guidance for all 24 quarters as a publicly traded company. The company's most recent beat occurred on August 6, 2020, when it reported 2Q20 non-GAAP EPS of $0.60 a share on revenue of $71.3 million, as compared to $0.76 a share on revenue of $53.0 million in 2Q19. These results surpassed not only its guidance, but also Street estimates by $0.16 and $6.8 million, respectively. Adj. EBITDA for the quarter grew 24% to $23.7 million versus $19.0 in the prior-year period. This solid performance was attributable to the fact that the company’s exposure to industries hit hardest by COVID-19 (travel, leisure, retail, and energy) was minimal, accounting for only 7% of its top line. In fact, with the work-at-home mantra during the pandemic, reliance on Upland’s Customer Experience Management Cloud increased significantly, resulting in 8% organic growth overall. Based on management’s increased FY20 forecast, organic growth should remain relatively brisk.(Source: Company Overview)Despite coronavirus, the company was able to expand relationships with 241 customers (50 of which were upgraded into the major account category) and add 118 new clients (34 major) in 2Q20.Management guided 3Q20 revenue to $70 million (versus a prior consensus of $65.7 million) and Adj. EBITDA to $23.3 million (based on range midpoints). For FY20, it raised its top line outlook from $263.4 million to $277.3 million and guided Adj. EBITDA to $94.2 million. It also hinted at acquisitions reinitiating in 4Q20, with 2021 likely a “banner year” on that front.Management then used this positive outlook and a recent run-up in the stock price to raise gross proceeds of ~$136.9 million (assuming greenshoe) at $34 a share, boosting its cash position in excess of $200 million. That largess and an additional $60 million available on its revolving credit facility set the company up for another round of acquisitions. Nearly all its $536 million debt obligation is not due until August 2026.Street analysts are buying into management’s growth-by-acquisition approach, sporting five buys and two outperform ratings. Their median twelve-month price target is north of $50 a share. Earlier this month, Trust Financial raised its price target on UPLD from $55 to $60, and Needham assigned a new Buy rating and $53 price target on the stock. The current median analyst estimate calls for $2.30 of EPS in FY2020, making UPLD's P/E a reasonable 16 times this year's profits.Board member David May is also bullish on Upland’s outlook based on his recent 10,000 share purchase at an average price of $33.72 on August 17, 2020.(Source: Company Overview)With exposure to a rapidly expanding industry, a large and diversified customer base, a recurring business model with high visibility, and a management team with a proven track record in the M&A space, the future for Upland appears bright and predictable. It is not so much that the company isn’t fairly valued - currently trading at 3.8x 2020E revenue - but rather, an investor can expect the stock price to appreciate in line with revenue growth for the foreseeable future. If organic growth continues to trend towards double digits, the company will command a much higher P/E multiple than the 16x 2020E Adj. EPS it currently receives. With plenty of dry powder in the form of $200+ million in cash, look for Upland to continue to execute on its business model.Given my current view of the overall market, I think the best way to take a watch item position in Upland is via a covered call strategy.Bret Jensen is the Founder of and authors articles for the Biotech Forum, Busted IPO Forum, and Insiders Forum"
4203363,25255,2018-08-31T07:51:12-04:00,"Upland continues to do successful acquisitions and also grows organically at a nice 6% pace.The company is keeping a good debt profile and was even presented with the opportunity to lower its effective rate.ESW Capital (the biggest shareholder) is unloading its shares, but I don't think investors should worry just yet.Operational improvements in sales and a favorable M&A environment provide for continued strong results for the foreseeable future.","Upland Software's (UPLD) recent quarter was definitely a strong one. I will post some excerpts from the company's earnings conference call along with my comments and highlights. The article is a little long, but you can skip the quoted parts if you like without missing anything significant.Upland acquired RO Innovation during the second quarter, and along with its earlier acquisitions, it helped boost the company's subscription revenue by 70% compared to Q2 2017. One thing that really annoyed me is that management did brag about meeting or exceeding guidance for ""16 straight quarters"", which is a dangerous point of view to have. Companies that live quarter by quarter and worry about ""meeting guidance"" do not always end well.However, the best part of the results, in my opinion, was its 6% organic growth mostly because one of the contributing factors was price increases. Inflation is a greatly favorable environment for Upland since it mostly pays with cash for its acquisitions. And despite management's conservative view of 0-5% organic growth long-term, I believe that price increases will help keep this growth at the upper bound of the guidance.The company is on a run-rate of about $50 million of adjusted EBITDA for 2018 and is generating decent amounts of cash flow. It has $19 million in cash on hand and about $105 million of usable U.S. Federal Tax NOLs that will help keep its tax bill significantly low for the foreseeable future. And finally, it is eliminating all server capex by migrating to AWS.Things are also going well on the debt front. The company has $95 million in available credit and their bankers told them that they can reduce their effective 6.6% interest rate.In the Q&A, the discussion was mostly focused on the company's ability to drive organic growth through across-the-board price increases, cross-selling, up-selling and improving the quality of its sales force. The company has a lot of complementary products and is definitely improving its sales force. However, management gave me the impression that it wants to downplay this until it has solid results to report.I also liked the comments on M&A opportunities. The company not only wants the target to be a strategic and complementary fit, but also to be at a decent price. Also, it is seeing a lot of opportunities in the market that fit it parameters.While ESW is lowering its stake in the company, I believe that it is a purely profit-taking move. Upland is currently in a sweet spot and will continue to benefit both from operational improvements that increase customer retention and revenue per customer and from a favorable M&A environment.You can read my initial analysis of Upland Software for more info, but my general take from this quarter is that the bullish case for the company is in full swing and will probably remain so for the foreseeable future.Cheers!"

After the iPhone was introduced in 2007, the company shifted its focus to mobile engagement capabilities.Management is headed by founder and CEO Matthew Sechrest, who was previously Vice President at now-inactive ArrowPath Venture Capital and an investment banker at Goldman Sachs (GS).Below is a brief demo video about Waterfall’s mobile marketing system:(Source: Rocco Baldassarre)Waterfall has focused its efforts on two industries, Restaurants and Retail. It says it has more than 200 clients worldwide and sends over 100 million messages per month.Investors put approximately $5 million into Waterfall in three offerings since 2009, according to SEC regulatory records. Given that founder & CEO Sechrest was a senior member at venture capital firm ArrowPath just before founding Waterfall, it is possible that some or all of the funding came from ArrowPath.Acquisition Terms and RationaleUpland paid Waterfall shareholders $24.4 million in cash. Also, Upland held back $1.5 million for 18 months. The amounts exclude ‘additional potential earnout payments tied to performance-based conditions,’ however Upland did not disclose the scope of that contingent consideration in either the press release or the 8-K filing.As of Upland’s March 31, 2017, 10-Q filing, the company had $19.4 million in cash, total liabilities of $102.8 million, and operating cash flow of $4.9 million for 1Q 2017.Given the recent low cash balance compared to the purchase price, Upland must have incurred additional debt under its expanded credit facility to close the deal. The company did not provide any balance sheet effect details in its disclosures so far.What management did say is the following,As is unfortunately common, Management makes liberal use of ‘Adjusted’ numbers rather than industry standard GAAP figures, which are usually less generous. By using ‘Adjusted’ numbers, management can ‘adjust’ the figures any way they see fit, making acquisitions look better than they otherwise would.So, why did Upland acquire Waterfall?As Upland’s Digital Engagement SVP/GM Jed Alpert stated in the deal announcement,As retail businesses struggle to remain relevant to customers and prospects in the battle for dollars with online merchants, there is a continuing need to generate greater engagement.Waterfall’s technology enables brands in the industries of retail, media, healthcare, government CPG and restaurants to more effectively prospect, convert prospects to paying customers and drive greater customer retention and lifetime value.Management says the price paid was within its ‘target range of 5-8x pro forma Adjust EBITDA and will be immediately accretive to Upland’s Adjusted EBITDA per share.’While UPLD saw an immediate bump up on the deal announcement, shares have since settled to only marginally higher than pre-announcement, as the five-day chart below shows,(Source: Seeking Alpha)While I understand the acquisition from a functional standpoint, I’m skeptical of management’s reliance on the moving target of ‘Adjusted’ financial effects.UPLD has risen dramatically since the beginning of 2017, so investors appear to like what they see.For this deal, until I learn what the GAAP effects are for the balance sheet and earnings, I’m on the sidelines.I write about M&A deals, public companies that invest in technology startups and IPOs.

Source: CrunchbaseAccording to a market research report by Transparency Market Research, the global email marketing market is projected to grow from $4.51 billion in 2016 to $22.16 billion by 2025.This represents a CAGR of 19.6% between 2016 and 2025.The main drivers for this expected growth are advancements and adoption of email marketing technologies.The Asia-Pacific region is projected to grow at the fastest CAGR of 22.8% during the forecast period.Major competitive vendors that provide enterprise email marketing solutions include:Upland disclosed the acquisition price and terms as $56 million in upfront cash and a holdback of $4.2 million cash payable in 12 months.With Adestra’s current year expected revenue of $18 million, the Price/Sales multiple is approximately 3.34x. This is a reasonable multiple for a software-enabled technology company considering management expects the deal to ‘generate at least $8.0 million in Adjusted EBITDA annually once fully integrated.’Upland funded the upfront consideration from its credit facility, which was expanded accordingly for the purpose of this transaction.Concurrent with the deal, management raised its full-year guidance for revenue, recurring revenue, and adjusted EBITDA.A review of the firm’s most recent 10-Q filing indicates that as of September 30, 2018, UPLD had cash and equivalents of $16.1 million and total liabilities of $238.3 million.Free cash flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, was $4.2 million.Upland acquired Adestra to add multi-channel messaging and email capabilities to its CXM Solution Suite.As Upland CEO Jack McDonald stated in the deal announcement:In the past 12 months, UPLD’s stock price has risen 27.8% vs. the S&P 500 Index drop of (3.6%), as the chart below indicates:Source: Seeking AlphaWhile the email marketing segment of customer experience promises to grow quickly in the years ahead, an important story for Upland is management’s stated focus on acquiring the technologies to build out its full-featured customer experience management suite [CXM] for enterprises.The vast middle market of enterprises is transitioning their information systems to the cloud, and Upland is well positioned to take advantage of this multi-decade growth opportunity with its cloud-based solutions.The current tight labor markets in the U.S. and other developed countries only increases the demand for automated solutions as enterprises seek solutions to maximize worker productivity while managing to budgetary requirements.Upland management is right to aggressively pursue acquisitions to fill in product gaps, as the time it takes to build a home-grown system means slower time-to-market.It also looks, at least with the Adestra deal, that management isn’t overpaying for the acquisition in the process. Assuming quick integration, the deal should accrue benefits to the firm and shareholders in 2019."
4080199,92146,2017-06-09T02:25:49-04:00,"UPLD’s stock price has gone up by 200% in the last 12-month period, which we believe would likely to continue.
        UPLD’s recent acquisition of RightAnswers Inc would help management improve their EBITDA margins as well as add $9 million annual revenue.
        UPLD’s management is taking the right steps to gradually improve their service offerings like releasing the new platform integration and data Management capabilities for PowerSteering PPM Solution last week.
        We believe UPLD’s stock price would likely reach the current price target of around $26 per share if the company can improve their bottom line in the coming quarters.","Despite impressive revenue growth in recent quarters, Upland Software Inc's (NASDAQ:UPLD) bottom line has failed to deliver the profits to its investors. While we remain optimistic about Upland Software Inc's long-term prospects, there are concerns if the management would be able to translate their top line growth to achieve sustainable profitability.Figure 1: Upland Software Inc's Stock Price Has Gone Up by Over 200% In the Last 12 MonthsOver the last one year, Upland Software Inc stock price has gone up from around $7.19 per share, and currently, it is trading at $21.61 per share, representing a 200.1% increase. Last week alone, their stock price went up 7.69% after Upland Software Inc releases New Platform Integration and Data Management Capabilities for PowerSteering PPM Solution.While we believe Upland Software Inc's management is on the right track to improve their top line, and if they can maintain even break even at this point, then their stock price would likely remain bullish and go above their current price target.Takeaway from Upland Software's Recent Financial PerformanceFigure 2: Upland Software Inc's Price Is Highly Correlated to Surging Quarterly RevenueOver the last year, Upland Software Inc's quarterly revenue increased from $17.58 million in Q1 2016 to $20.75 million in Q1 2017, which represented a 18.03% year-over-year increase in the company's top line. If we examine carefully, Upland Software Inc's recent price chart fits perfectly with their increasing top line. Hence, it may be fair to say that the bullish momentum has of the company's stock price has a high correlation to the increasing revenue growth.Figure 3: Upland Software Inc Revenue Growth Came at the Expense of Sustained ProfitabilityAlthough Upland Software Inc's management was able to maintain a gradual top line growth over the last year, they did so at the expense of profit. Despite a record quarterly revenue in Q1 2017, the net loss of the company was a massive -$5.61 million. In fact, since 2015, this is the third time Upland Software Inc posted a negative first quarter of the year, which prompt us to believe that there are seasonal expenses that the management is not being able to handle during the first two quarters of the year.Upland Software Likely to Maintain the Growth MomentumSince the revenue growth is the key, which is driving investors to increase their exposure to Upland Software Inc, it is worth taking a look at if this growth would likely to be sustainable in the coming quarters or not.On April 24, 2017, Upland Software Inc announced to acquire cloud-based knowledge management system company RightAnswers Inc, which will complement their existing services and provide Upload's customers the ability to boost their enterprise-wide collaboration capabilities.Jack McDonald, the Chairman and CEO of Upland Software Inc, is right to predict that the acquisition would help the company to increase their EBITDA margin to around 40%. We believe this acquisition will greatly help them to address their bottom line issue as well.RightAnswers Inc's current customers and create an additional revenue source for Upland Software Inc, which the press release claimed to be around $9 million per year. Hence, we believe the current revenue growth momentum of Upland Software Inc would likely to sustain in the near future, as the RightAnswers Inc alone would push their quarterly revenue up by around $2.25 million.Furthermore, last week, on June 1, Upland Software Inc announced that they rolled out the PowerSteering Project and Portfolio Management (PPM) solution, which will greatly improve the integration capabilities through the Upland Integration Platform. It will connect enterprise PPM with their Tenrox Professional Services Automation (NYSE:PSA)) application. As a result, it will integrate their key solutions like PowerSteering and Tenrox PSA together. Small, but significant, improvements like these would likely help Upland Software Inc maintain its growth momentum.ConclusionWhile we are certain that Upland Software Inc management is taking the right steps, like buying the right companies and improving their core value propositions, to maintain their growth momentum, we think it is about time they focus on improving their bottom line as well.Upland Software Inc currently has a high price target of $26 per share. Based on the current market price of $21.61 per share, it offers secondary investors an additional 20.32% upside potential.Being established in 2010, Upland Software Inc does not have much room to convince investors that they are growing at the cost of their bottom line. We think if the management takes necessary steps to leverage the RightAnswers Inc acquisition, which would likely help them improve their EBITDA margins, then their stock price would likely go much higher than the current price target of $26 per share in the coming quarters."

3234116,48411,2015-06-03T17:20:37-04:00,UPLD should be able to grow and grow quickly with all the positive tailwinds at its back.But it grows at a measly 12% Y/Y on a GAAP basis and guides full year Adjusted EBITDA growth of just 13%.What exactly is UPLD acquiring if in non-acquisition season it can't drive growth?With a question this large I recommend readers avoid UPLD.,"I guess I just ""don't get"" Upland Software (NASDAQ:UPLD).Nothing about this company makes sense to me. I mean, I want to like this company and I want to recommend it as a long position in that it participates in a really hot enterprise niche and has a growth strategy that I generally gravitate to, but that's just about it. Everything else about UPLD is a mystery to me.If somebody out there has an explanation for the questions I have they apparently aren't sharing it with the rest of the market which appears to be perplexed as well. UPLD, despite its sex appeal and its broader space tailwind, has failed to move back to anywhere close to breakeven to IPO pricing since coming public. Shares trade intraday at ~$7.85 after coming public at $12.So what are my questions? Well the first one, the biggest, is why can't UPLD grow?If you look back at the UPLD S-1 it looks like UPLD at one point was growing really quickly but has stalled as of late, this is partially true but misled in the end. UPLD has in fact grown quickly in its past but not organically. UPLD has pieced together its growth, just about all of it, via acquisitions - which I don't have a problem with and generally would applaud. The ""generally"" hinging on if the company can show anything of organic growth in addition to the acquired growth. This is something UPLD has struggled with despite having a fairly sizable S&M budget (at Q1/15 reporting this came in at ~20% of sales), again participating in a space that is hot, and being located in the tech capital of the Southwest (Austin, TX).At Q1/15 reporting UPLD reported just 12% revenue growth. This is what is keeping me on the sideline. Forgetting for a moment that I don't like the particular way that UPLD's product portfolio fits together, it's an eclectic mix (to put it mildly) in my humble opinion, shouldn't there be anything of organic growth to be derived from these acquisitions? Is UPLD simply a graveyard for no growth purchases? It would seem so at this point. I'd love some information regarding what growth rates the solutions acquired were achieving prior to coming under the UPLD umbrella. I mean, seriously, these solutions can't do better than 12% Y/Y? What is UPLD paying for if that's all it's getting?This lack of growth cost UPLD in regards to its Adjusted EBITDA reporting at Q1/15 with Adjusted EBITDA falling Y/Y from ~$1.5 million to ~350,000. Adjusted EBITDA margin also contracted from 10% to 2%. Now, UPLD is guiding full year Adjusted EBITDA to be $4.3 million at the top end of guidance which would still be at a higher run rate than 2014 Adjusted EBITDA but only by ~13%. Again, is that what I'm to be excited about?Oh, that's right. I'm expected to be excited about the potential for UPLD to lean on its new $60 million revolver to complete acquisitions to drive growth. But then what? Then we just have a larger graveyard? And what happens when the TAM, but this could be years down the road - I'm simply making a point here, has less greenfield opportunity and UPLD has to compete against other sizeable solution providers? If you think anything UPLD is doing isn't completely commoditized in 2015 you're wrong, it is. Wait to see just what a commodity these services become in say two years. See where I'm going with this?If UPLD can't evidence that it can drive organic sales now, at a time where it has everything being helpful (funding, sector strength, location, sector macros, etc.) what will it do when it runs funding down/the sector gets more competitive/funding is more expense/etc.?At its current market cap UPLD really only has two things that are attractive about it - the revolver and the fact that it doesn't burn a whole bunch of cash. That's really in. In that, I would leave this name alone.I continue to recommend readers avoid UPLD.Good luck everybody."
2659595,48411,2014-11-10T12:30:00-05:00,"UPLD has built its entire business via acquisition.
        UPLD has an attractive cash flow statement and a share float size that should allow owners to ride the acquisition wave to higher prices.
        Midterm and long-term holders should be encouraged by the growing Adjusted EBITDA and recurring revenues at UPLD.","Upland Software, Inc. (NASDAQ:UPLD), the cloud-based enterprise work management software company, has come to the IPO markets offering a semi-unique opportunity. For starters, the entire company has only been around since 2010 and for the most part was a shell company until 2011 when the company's founders had an actionable plan to start to piece together the current version of the business. That being said, the company is offering investors a chance to own a participant in a really young space that in the early goings has shown to be very attractive to the target markets. It's fairly rare that you get the opportunity to invest in a company just 36 real months into its business and one that has grown primarily as a result of acquisition. Simply put, the founding fathers of UPLD had an idea, knew how to aggregate market share via acquiring the right pieces and have decided to go the route of buying solutions rather than developing. I happen to like the sound of the strategy and think that the financial results so far have spoken well of this pedal to the metal go to market strategy.What does UPLD offer? UPLD offers a suite of services delivered via SAAS that helps optimize business activities. I know that ""activities"" describes a pretty wide spectrum of possible endpoints but that's exactly what UPLD's comprehensive solution does, it allows users of the service to cover quite a bit of ground. Everything from strategic planning to task execution to document sharing to analyzing project spend can be done while within the UPLD platform. The goal for the UPLD platform, and I think it's done this so far to this point, wasn't for the solution to change the underlying business but to make the business more efficient. These days, if you can purchase efficiency you do it and UPLD's expanding customer base is a great example of this.Now, it should be noted that UPLD's solution isn't unique per say from a technology standpoint. Many of the efficiency improvement mechanisms and actual standalone arms of the platform exist and have existed for quite some time and in most cases are already being used in some capacity by customers. What makes UPLD different from the legacy solutions and from current competitors is that UPLD's system is delivered via the cloud, negating the need for hardware or software installation by customers; UPLD's solution is comprehensive, many of UPLD's current customers were using individual point solutions purchased from several different vendors which created multiple software or hardware installation needs and the need for users to learn multiple different platform operating procedures; UPLD's platform is for the most part open architecture which allows the company to tailor its solution to the direct needs of the company; and finally UPLD's platform offers flexibility with scaling usage up and down with its ""by the seat"" purchasing model - UPLD requires customers purchase ""seat"" usage which allows customers to use its software at a certain amount of terminals rather than paying one set fee regardless of size.This fact that UPLD is selling into a market that is already using and frankly semi-reliant on legacy solutions is the other part of the business model that I find unusually attractive but also one that brings about longer term concerns for me. I like the idea that because the market is already aware of and educated to the benefits of a base solution that selling cycles have been shorter for UPLD than would have been had it been introducing a new idea. This is definitely a good thing. I don't like the fact that the barrier to entry on the surface appears to be relatively low and that longer term if the UPLD platform can be replicated that UPLD could experience some pricing pressure and/or attrition from companies who develop a solution that also have outside relationships with the customer (for example providing human capital management capacity to the company). In the short-term, however, I think the idea of owning the cloud based transition is an option that should be taken advantage of and I've seen great success with this strategy in the HCM space, it being just as low barrier to entry and it having the same longer term concerns about pricing pressure.With UPLD just a few days into trading, which has been wild even for IPO markets, it's definitely worth looking into the financials and considering at least the shorter term possibilities knowing that UPLD is acquisition ready and now has the C&CE to materially grow its operations by way of this channel over the next few quarters.Growing Quickly and Looking to ContinueI think UPLD management see's what's going on in the general SAAS market place with solution providers being able to take huge market share across the spectrum from legacy providers and sees that for the most part the winning strategy so far has been to soak up as much of that market share as possible and worry about profitability later. With the fixed costs and the scale-up costs of running a SAAS delivery business being fairly low and with the two largest income statement scale-up expenses being S&M and share based comp getting to profitability once the revenue pool is big enough shouldn't be all that hard for UPLD. With that being said, UPLD is definitely growing the revenue pool.Knowing that UPLD plans to and has been growing the revenue pool by acquisition let's take a look at CC&E, contractual obligations (outflows that will drag to CC&E and cash from operations) and capitalization (to show any pressure to the top-line figures prior to hitting the bottom line):First, CC&E has grown to a Pro Forma As Adjusted $46.2 million (as of IPO) which is a great place to start. Investors should also note the large and growing larger balances of Goodwill and Intangible assets - which comprise ~49% of total assets. Prior to the IPO which obviously sent CC&E higher these two line items comprised ~70% of assets, which is probably the figure you should use when assessing the UPLD balance sheet because it's my expectation that that CC&E balance goes out the door quickly, and places emphasis on two facts: 1) this shows that UPLD is to this point almost entirely an acquisition story and sorting out organic growth from acquired growth is going to be near impossible - UPLD doesn't provide a breakout of this in its S-1, 2) UPLD must continue to show, at least for the mid-term, continued growth of cash flows and revenue growth to justify not impairing its Goodwill and Intangible assets, which I'm in no way saying these are in danger of impairment I'm just saying those are the natural pressures that acquisition based growth stories are faced with. All told, the balance sheet looks strong and is clean but it should be for such a young company.Just a few quick notes here on capitalization: 1) another unique positive about owning such a young story is that UPLD hasn't had the change even pre-IPO to build huge balances of preferred stock or other financing vehicles into its balance sheet. With this being said, at IPO when the existing balances converted to common shares the float expansion was very well managed. Now, with CC&E to further its growth strategy and no shorter term needs for financing shares should have the opportunity to move higher into the larger but still smaller sized float; 2) the accumulated loss is fairly small figure that breaks down to about ~$10 million per year of actual existence (ex. first year incorporation where the company was a shell company), this means investors haven't had to sit around for long periods of time on ""dead"" capital and haven't taken on the kinds of losses that make them want to exit at first opportunity. Is that a speculative statement? Yes. Does it make sense? Yes. I'm not saying go get long shares on that note but it definitely is something to keep in mind.Finally, UPLD has really manageable obligations coming due over the next 36 months. Outflows inclusive of lease obligations calculate to an average of about ~$6 million a year for the next three years before dipping off from year three to five. I'm not saying this graphic will look like it does now in the future but if UPLD can remain as close to FCF generating as it has historically, historically is has been very close to breakeven which has managed cash burn (this is a huge positive by the way) and should be FCF generating (assuming no further scale-up which we know is probably a low percentage possibility) in 2015 if all factors of operations remain the same, these limited outflows will really allow UPLD operational flexibility.Notice the breakeven level when taking cash provided from operations and looking at cash used in investing activities when you back out acquisition costs (1H/14 is a great example of this). You can see that for full year 2012, full year 2013 and for both 1H's UPLD would have generated FCF or been very close to it if it had not made acquisitions. Clearly with the growth strategy being to grow by acquisition we know that UPLD won't be generating FCF but it is important to note the low cash maintenance nature of this business.The actual operations themselves are hard to get a feel for just yet from the standpoint of what deciding what UPLD can do organically but the strategy isn't organic growth at this point so I'm not sure how relevant trying to assess that would be.The net income line is going to be skewed here because of the growth in share based comp, which I found it disappointing that UPLD didn't provide a breakout of this in its S-1, but the Adjusted EBITDA graphic to be presented later will do a good job at backing that out and presenting to a truer picture of growth and scale-up costs. That said, UPLD generating more revenue in 1H/14 than it did in fully year 2012, grew revenue from 2012 to 2013 by 81%, and grew revenue from 1H/13 to 1H/14 by 70%. Now, we know that revenue growth to this point and for the near term will be largely determined by the timing of acquisitions but it encouraging to see that the acquisitions are being executed and market share is being grown. UPLD has the normal expansion to operating expenses you would expect to see of a scale up which has driven net loss growth.Revenue growth by segment looks healthy and so does total revenue composition. I haven't mentioned to this point that UPLD is running a subscription based model while charging implementation fees upfront as well. The implementation fees which right now are at 3% composition are relatively meaningless which leaves the revenue model to be one that is highly recurring and that eventually will provide high visibility into future revenues, cash flow, and modeling. This is a big reason I'm so hot on SAAS companies in the early going.The actual recurring revenue has shown great growth rates as well on an annualized basis and they should considering the growth strategy. UPLD doesn't provide a projected number prior to giving the real number at yearly reporting but 2014 should show a rate right in trend with the impressive figures above. I'm actually hoping to more importantly see an uptick in retention rate which sits at 90% right now, inclusive of acquisition attrition which is natural, but needs to come up about 5% to sit at the SAAS retention norm for by current holdings. I'm watching that very closely.You also get the Adjusted EBITDA figures in this graphic for full year 2012 and 2013 which shows a nice level of growth. I'll detail the 1H figures below.So, as we noted in the income statement section the Adjusted EBITDA figures show the true growing profitability and health of the company's operations. I think once the sales team gets up to full productivity and UPLD begins to slow G&A and S&M real dollar growth to levels that would be indicative of having its base infrastructure in place that more of what we're seeing here will transition to the income statement but the share based comp pressure to the bottom line should hang around for quite a while. I'm going to continue to use Adjusted EBITDA to track company health even though its non-GAAP because I think it does a better job at providing clarity and from this graphic I like what I see.Where's the trade?I'm going to own UPLD in the short-term on a quarter by quarter basis and look to DCA into a full position, which will be very small, over the next several weeks. I could see the stock having violent movements as a result of low volume trading and overall macro volatility.I like the growth strategy, I like the SAAS platform, and I like the balance sheet. The company hasn't been around long enough to build a huge float via preferred conversions and with it already being an attractive business that just makes being able to ride the wave higher easier.I recommend a long position in UPLD for sophisticated or IPO experienced investors. I look forward to providing continuing coverage in the future. Good luck to all."
3977123,77545,2016-05-24T12:24:33-04:00,A legacy software roll-up strategy with no singular focus or vision is a terrible idea.Recent insider deals were self serving.Company is overvalued by at least $50M.,"If you read the Upland (NASDAQ:UPLD) company byline, you see something that usually reads like this:That sounds cool. And was enough to get investors to buy into the company during its initial public offering in 2014. However, the company byline would be more accurate if it said something like this:Without a doubt, you could round up 4 or 5 fresh MBA graduates, give them $100M to buy software companies, ship them off to Silicon Valley and it's likely the crew would round up a more compelling investment than what Upland has managed to do.Before I tell you how I really feel about Upland's software offerings, let's go over some of them in more detail since it's likely you have no idea what the company actually does.Clickability by Upland manages to squeeze several buzz words into its description. The software is a SaaS, Web Content Management (WCM), Website Marketing Acceleration (WMA), Content Management System (CMS). First of all, Clickability is one of the worst names I've ever seen for a CMS, but I'll look past that since Joomla and Drupal aren't any better.Basically, Clickability is back-end software that allows website owners to publish content. In comparison to better know competitors, Clickability is closely related to Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) in the fact that it's a proprietary SaaS offering, but also WordPress, Joomla, Drupal due to the fact that it's customizable/extendable based on the needs of clients.The cool thing from a business perspective about Content Management Systems tailored to large clients is that customers can be married to the software a bit. Newspapers publishing dozens or even hundreds of articles per day are going to face a challenge migrating to a new operating system - especially from a Search Engine Optimization (SEO) standpoint. In theory, once a customer has been sold Clickability, the odds of them renewing might be more based on the difficulty of switching to another provider, which is a powerful position to be in from UPLD's perspective.According to a fairly extensive review written by a person who claims to have worked for a re-seller of Upland software, in 2014, Worldnow and IBSYS were the main competitors to Upland. From the enterprise level, things are likely fairly similar today which is nice from a sales perspective.In the most recent quarter, management indicated $840,000 new or renewal contracts for the quarter. However, as described in the review linked above, Clickability is for large publishers (like newspapers) so the total addressable market isn't nearly as wide as competitors who target the small business/low-end website like Wix, Web.com (NASDAQ:WEB) or GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY). In fact, I only bring up the other public companies because you'll likely recognize the names - Clickability is no where near those platforms in terms of scale and total addressable market.Mobile Commons is an enterprise level self-service software solution that manages/sends text messages. It's likely we've all experienced these as they are common in the medical field to remind/confirm appointment times.The biggest challenge with this business model is differentiation among competition. Unlike Clickability which can separate itself with features, the text message marketing space is a more commoditized product offering. A Google search for ""text message marketing"" reveals dozens of competitors who appear to be fiercely competing for the same customers. The only way to gain traction in this type of competitive marketplace is to target specific types of businesses. I'm not sure if this is intentional on UPLD's part, but in the most recent quarter, it announced a non-profit organization (NPO) recommitted to using Mobile Commons for $185,000 per year - and the company mentions ""NPOs"" in the byline on its Twitter account.Upland acquired Mobile Commons in December 2014 for $5.7M cash and roughly $4.5M in UPLD stock at the time. According to SEC filings, the $5.7M cash payment was the largest use of shareholder funds gained during the company's IPO in 2014 after paying debt.HipCricket is a company that UPLD acquired in 2016. The acquisition is interesting on a number of levels. First thing about HipCricket is the company filed for bankruptcy in 2015. Ultimately, two bidders emerged from bankruptcy, the winner being ESW Capital for roughly $7.3M.A few months later ESW Capital sold the advertising portion of HipCricket to SITO Mobile (NASDAQ:SITO) for $3.7M cash/stock. The interesting part of that deal was SITO Mobile was the second bidder in the HipCricket bankruptcy auction a few months prior.The remaining portion of HipCricket is a mobile text message business somewhat similar to Mobile Commons. In an equity/asset swap deal, ESW Capital shipped the assets of HipCricket in exchange for an asset owned by UPLD called EMP Live (valued at $5.9M) and stock valued at $5.7M. All pretty standard except ESW Capital is the largest shareholder in UPLD. According to recent Form 4 SEC filings, ESW Capital and its affiliates own over 5.3M shares of UPLD.Pretty darn good deal if you're ESW Capital right? Buy a company out of bankruptcy for $7.3M and one year later have received $1.3M in cash, 8.2M in equity in two different companies, and a business valued at $5.9M.But wait it gets better. Given that UPLD was essentially buying an asset from the largest shareholder of the company, it's customary that UPLD obtains an opinion from a neutral third party on the fairness of the deal.Care to guess the 3rd largest institutional shareholder of UPLD's stock?Source: MorningstarSo a lot of insider stuff going on here, and more on ESW Capital in a bit, but the main point from a revenue standpoint is HipCricket was bankrupt in 2015 after mounting nearly $100M in losses since 2012. At one point in time, HipCricket was considered a leader in its space, so investing in this business now must come with some kind of faith it will reinvent itself one day. However, when (and if) that day will come is anyone's guess.FileBound was acquired in 2013. This is a document workflow solution used by enterprises. A consulting firm posted a SWOT analysis of the company in 2014 and basically said FileBound is not an all-in-one type solution along with there being numerous competitors.There seems to be positive reviews of the software online; however, all seem to bring up one notable issue with this type of software in general. The end user usually needs to prepare and train/re-train staff on how to use the software. For some companies, the cost associated with this along with the disruption in business likely don't outweigh the benefits of FileBound. For other companies, unless FileBound is the perfect solution - numerous industry competitors exist making the odds FileBound captures a significant amount of market share in this industry slim.Recently, UPLD completed a tuck-in acquisition of Advanced Processing & Imaging to enhance the FileBound offering. One note about this deal is it was all cash, so that could mean companies are poking around UPLD's stock and opting for cash instead. If that trend continues, it will certainly slow the rate of acquisitions even further. Here is a list of notable acquisitions UPLD has completed over the years.Acquisitions + ConsiderationThat's a decent number of acquisitions for a company of this size. Keep in mind the total above aren't necessarily all cash. However, all were financed with equity and debt too. Here's what management recently had to say about the future pipeline of acquisitions:Great to hear that management will be more focused after acquiring a mishmash array of product offerings and blowing through the majority of shareholder funds in the process.The main issue with most of these acquisitions in tandem is there are few synergies between them. Management is aware of these issues, but it's almost as if they are discovering this on the fly based on what management said during the most recent quarter:There are sales and marketing courses in college that cover this at the undergraduate level; it's highly alarming that management at a public company is just now finding this out after accumulating a $54.5M deficit since inception.Latest FinancialsUPLD last reported earnings on May 12, 2016. At the time, the company had a mere $13.585M in cash. So let's take a look at the revenue trend over the last 5 quarters to see how the company is going to turn that around:Total RevenueQ1 2016 = $17.58MQ4 2015 = $17.6MQ3 2015 = $17.1MQ2 2015 = $17.68MQ1 2015 = $17.53MTalk about boring. If UPLD were spitting off free cash and distributing that to investors, it might make UPLD a compelling investment. However, the only way to capitalize on UPLD is by shares appreciating. Organic revenue expansion just isn't going to materialize overnight given the competition and the fact the recently acquired companies were likely distressed assets when purchased by UPLD. Based on this revenue trend, it's going to be a very slow ramp (at best) for UPLD and its investors.Loss From OperationsQ1 2016 = ($4.16M)Q4 2015 = ($2.78M)Q3 2015 = ($1.81M)Q2 2015 = ($2.51M)Q1 2015 = ($3.13M)You can look at adjusted numbers all you want. The bottom line is that real money is flowing out of the business each quarter. For a company with limited cash resources on hand, no revenue growth, and growing debt on the balance sheet - this is an alarming trend.The main issue with a roll-up strategy that's not consolidated around one common business model is that you're always going to have push and pull within the business units. One quarter you might gain traction in one segment of the business while other portions of the business lag behind.The revenue and loss from operations figures from the last 5 quarters also paint a bleak picture for investors. If the company is unable to generate positive cash flows from the roll-up strategy, it will lead to more dilution and/or bank debt.Adjusted EBIDTAThe problem with UPLD's management touting adjusted EBIDTA in press release headlines is the figure doesn't account for costs associated with the acquisitions - which has been the primary focus of the company over the last several years! One might argue that these figures are not material; however, due to the fact that UPLD has a mere $13M in the cash and mounting debt, we aren't talking about a multi-billion dollar company here. Every last dollar matters.Using the company's 10-K which had financial data on the company dating back to 2012, I've identified some costs that investors should not adjust for given the size and state of the balance sheet at UPLD.Totals for years 2012 through 2015I sure wish I could have done some adjustments like this on my taxes, but for some reason I don't believe the IRS would be too happy about that. As an investor, I like to focus on reality. And the reality is you can adjust all you want but it's not going to change the bottom line of UPLD.ESW/Joseph LiemandtRecently, I was doing research on a company called Broadvision (NASDAQ:BVSN), and I noticed the company had a new #1 shareholder who was buying shares of the company religiously. I published an article about it here and that new shareholder turned out to be ESW Capital/Joseph Liemandt. Ultimately, after researching Mr. Liemandt and ESW Capital, it lead me to UPLD.If you have faith in ESW Capital, or more specifically Mr. Liemandt himself, then I guess there's no need for concern about his major position in UPLD. What does have me concerned is the HipCricket transaction clearly directly benefited Mr. Liemandt/ESW before anyone else. While his direct involvement might have led to UPLD getting the piece of business it desired from HipCricket, the manner in which the deal was executed brings into question the motivations of this investor.It's also is somewhat unethical from the standpoint of the previous creditors of HipCricket. What if Mr. Liemandt, SITO Mobile and UPLD had made a bid for HipCricket's assets? Don't you think the asking price would have been higher - which would have been the fair thing for creditors of HipCricket?Given Mr. Liemandt's large stake in the company, and the fact he continues to buy shares - one might buy into what's good for Mr. Liemandt is good for UPLD. That could be the case. However, maybe UPLD is the way Mr. Liemandt taps the public debt markets while building the real profitable business models in his own private portfolio of companies - which he has many.Remember, Mr. Liemandt bought a company from bankruptcy. Then less than 1 year later sold only a portion of that company to UPLD, where he's the #1 shareholder, for more than what was paid for 100% of the company in bankruptcy just a year prior. That sounds shady as hell and I'd hit the sell button and run from this investment just based on this transaction alone.ValuationAs you probably realize, given that there are so many moving parts to Upland - it's difficult to value the business using traditional metrics. Revenues from some parts of the company might trade at one multiple, while others will trade at a different rate. This dynamic makes it difficult for the average shareholder to understand what they are buying into.This also makes UPLD unattractive from an acquisition standpoint. Companies might be interested in certain segments of UPLD, but certainly not the entire company. As time moves forward, that will cause UPLD's stock to lag over others in the industry with a more consolidated offering.As of writing, UPLD's shares were $7.22 each and the company had a market cap of $121M. If we add up the approximate raw consideration paid for the companies UPLD has acquired since 2012, we get to around $90M. Given that most of these deal involve equity financing, the cash value of these companies is much lower. Add in that the company has $13M in cash and we get to $103M... but that's extremely generous.We've seen over the last 5 quarters revenue is not growing, and the company has burned cash in each of those quarters. Total liabilities, including debt mount to roughly $75M based on SEC filings.The financials paint a picture of a company that is extremely overvalued. I've just recently finished investigating several software companies that are valued at only a fraction of total revenue. BSQUARE (NASDAQ:BSQR) being one of them. The fact that UPLD has a valuation that exceeds yearly revenue totals (currently about $70M) is more of a testament to UPLD being somewhat misunderstood, under-followed and the fact insiders are controlling the majority stock. This is a luxury the stock might not have in the future since it's certain this stock will need to keep issuing shares to executives, fund acquisitions, and keep the lights on.Bottom line. Based on the software mix, this company should be valued at 1x revenue max. I fully expect this valuation to be reflected over the course of time as investors start to realize how bad the software mix really is.ConclusionsRiding the coattails of insider investors would be an easy strategy if it worked every time. I can't tell you how many times I've seen someone justify an investment because some other guy he's never met is in the stock. I wonder if notable investors like Warren Buffett would have been as successful just mimicking what other larger investors are doing?Also, just because of the heavy presence of insiders controlling the stock doesn't mean they'll keep it propped up forever. At some point, the business will need to stand on its own two legs or other market forces will start to take the share price over. I see nothing indicating UPLD is on the tipping point of increasing sales to the point significant free cash is generated. Management certainly hasn't guided for this either.Upon further investigation of the actual software Upland sells, it's clear most of it can be considered 'legacy' in nature - which is why UPLD was able to acquire 100% of it recently. If I've learned anything growing up next door to Silicon Valley is that if someone is trying to sell you 100% of their software business, you should run. Only after achieving the growth potential founders believe is possible do they sell 100% of it and move on to something else. UPLD is acquiring assets leftover from previous eras of software and rolling them up into an investment called Upland. That doesn't sound like a compelling investment and over time anyone holding UPLD's shares will realize this. It might take some time, but the market will soon realize this and shares of this company are bound to trade much lower than where they are today."
2670775,25120,2014-11-12T14:28:09-05:00,"Upland Software's IPO disappointed.The allure of cloud and rapid growth usually entices investors, but this wasn't the case with Upland's offering.Due to a lack of organic growth combined with losses, I'm staying away from UPLD shares.","Upland Software's (NASDAQ:UPLD) IPO has disappointed investors over the past week. The company provides cloud-based enterprise work management software. While this is generally a hot area for investors, Upland's offering has not gone well.The Public OfferingUpland provides enterprise solutions, which include work management, strategic planning and task execution. The software applications Upland provides allows for a greater capacity as well as improved productivity of knowledge workers across the globe.Upland sold 3.85 million shares for $12 apiece, thereby raising $46 million in gross proceeds. All of the shares offered were sold by the company with no shares benefiting selling shareholders.Shares were offered at the low end of the preliminary offering range of $12-$14 per share. At the public offering price of $12, with some 14.3 million shares outstanding, shares are valued at $172 million.ValuationUpland operates in a rapidly growing industry, although it stresses that growth has been aided by past dealmaking. The company has posted spectacular sales growth in recent times as revenues of $41.1 million for 2013 came in nearly 81% higher year-over-year. Losses increased from $2.6 million to $9.3 million over the same time period.Rapid headline revenue growth continued in the first six months of this year, as revenues were up by just over 70% to $31.8 million. At the same time, the bottom line took a huge hit with losses increasing from $2.6 million to $15.9 million as the costs of R&D more than quadrupled to $18.4 million over the first half of 2014.For the third quarter of this year, revenues are anticipated to improve to $16-$16.5 million. This would represent 54% to 59% growth on an annual basis, indicating that the pace of growth is slowing down. The company admits that virtually all of this revenue growth results from the acquisition of companies such as FileBound, Marex, ComSci and Clickability.Ahead of the offering, Upland held roughly $3 million in cash while it had $22 million in debt outstanding. Part of the proceeds will be used to repay a portion of its debt. This will result in a net cash position of roughly $25 million.Shares of the company actually fell after the offering, currently trading around $11.00, which values the business at approximately $155 million. After backing out net cash holdings of $45 million, this results in operating assets valued around $130 million. This values the company at roughly 2X annualized revenues.Investment ThesisAs noted above, the public offering of Upland has been a big disappointment. Shares were sold at the low end of the preliminary offering range, falling to current levels around $11.00 per share, despite a more than 10% jump this past Friday.Even though Upland operates in a growth industry, considerable risk exists. The fact is that most of this growth actually results from dealmaking, resulting in somewhat artificial growth. With this in mind, the performance is less impressive given the rapid growth seen in the industry. Companies such as Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) or Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) are growing at more rapid rates.Upland's $16.0-$16.5 million Q3 sales guidance results in essentially flat revenue growth compared to the $16.2 million reported in the second quarter. This just shows that organic growth has come to a complete standstill, or potentially even worse, is slipping. Other risks include lack of profitability, limited operating history and heightened competition.You get the point. There is no organic growth, the company is still bleeding cash and while the revenue multiples do not appear to be demanding, the operational performance of the business is not impressive either. As such, I remain very cautious, failing to see the competitive advantage of the business or its solutions, in a rapidly moving competitive market."
3039356,48411,2015-03-30T15:12:22-04:00,"UPLD reported a great Q4 and FY2014 but it was 2015 revenue guidance of just 13% that has investors spooked.If UPLD isn't the high growth story the market thought it was this opens the company's balance sheet up for potential Goodwill impairment - lots of it.A post-quarter 8-K detailing changes to how Adjusted EBITDA is defined, as well as other EBITDA and debt covenants, opens up the company's growth strategy to questions.Yes, UPLD does still have cash to spend but with potential Goodwill impairments on the way will it?Avoid UPLD for now and maybe consider it for a short if the growth guidance isn't materially changed at Q1 reporting - I don't expect it to change.","Upland Software (NASDAQ:UPLD) gave investors a mixed bag with its Q4 reporting. After being stopped out of my initial position, taken just after the company came public, I have no intentions of buying back in. I also recommend that UPLD's small Seeking Alpha following refrain from getting long shares or adding to positions until at least Q1 reporting and even then only if results detailed or guidance can put to ease the growth concerns raised at Q4. I don't expect this to happen. Should this not happen during Q1 reporting I would think UPLD is moved to being an opportunity from the short side.In regards to those growth concerns, my concerns start and end with full year 2015 guidance. UPLD guided out just 15% Q1/15 growth and just 13% full year revenue growth - both figures are on a constant currency basis and both figures have been guided several points lower on an actual reporting basis. Keep in mind that if the USD is to show continued strength even the reported guidance given of 11% and 9% for the respective periods could be off to the upside. Also keep in mind that these figures are a cliff-dive away from current Q4 and full year reported (2014) growth of 39% and 60%. Yes, these figures would have UPLD (outside of accelerating growth via acquisition - which may not be an option for the company any longer) reaching a terminal growth rate in the high single digits much faster than initially modeled. This becomes especially concerning when considering that 43.1% of the balance sheet assets (ex. C&CE) are comprised of Goodwill. Substantially the value of acquisitions is tethered to the direct and indirect rate of revenues being modeled into DCF analysis. Should the growth of revenues be less than initially modeled by the company at the time of acquisition this would result in UPLD needing to mark-down its Goodwill accounting. I have to believe that UPLD, when acquiring technologies/companies, had higher expectations modeled in for revenue growth than the mid-teens percentages guided. I believe UPLD to be at significant risk for Goodwill impairment in the mid-term.I should also note that subsequent to quarter end UPLD filed a not specific 8-K filing which detailed that the company has extended the maturity on its revolver, held the borrowing base flat, and executed several amendments to existing covenants. While my primary issue with this filing is that it doesn't detail with specificity in regards to the phrase, ""modifies the definition of adjusted EBITDA and certain other terms"", I also take issue with zero granularity being given around, ""must comply with a minimum recurring revenue financial covenant, minimum cash financial covenant, and minimum adjusted EBITDA financial covenant"", and, ""must comply with a maximum total senior debt to adjusted EBITDA financial covenant, a maximum total debt to adjusted EBITDA financial covenant and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio financial covenant"". While I understand that EBITDA and debt covenants aren't unusual by any means I still will note that with my entire initial UPLD bull thesis (which is now defunct) was based on the idea that UPLD would utilize a ""growth by acquisition"" strategy. These phrases significantly change (or could change) UPLD's ability to execute on the thesis itself. Depending on how restrictive the debt covenants are or how restrictive the Adjusted EBITDA covenants are or for that matter how Adjusted EBITDA is defined there may or may not be a UPLD bull thesis on the table. That's not good for those long shares.I recommend UPLD longs consider risking off, even at today's depressed pricing, and those considering a position wait until more granularity can be given as to UPLD's revolver covenants, its growth strategy going forward (inclusive of how it will spend the ~$31 million C&CE on its balance sheet), and the potential for both to change the guided top-line growth. As its stands that level of growth is unacceptable for such a young company with so much Goodwill on its books.Good luck everybody."

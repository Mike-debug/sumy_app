4364219,25120,2020-08-04T13:30:12-04:00,"Varian Medical has shown solid growth in recent years since the Varex spin-off, as this growth has attracted Siemens Healthineers.The deal seems very reasonable for investors in Varian which have seen excellent long-term returns, in part driven by a rich multiple attached towards the shares.If I were a holder, I would gladly accept the offer, as the pro-forma combination become a power play in cancer healthcare.","The investment story for Varian Medical Systems (VAR) ""ended"" as the Germans have arrived and made a move for the company, with the contemplated deal having real good odds of being closed later this year.It has been early 2015 since I last looked at Varian and concluded that the company has great growth prospects while it traded at a fair price. I noted that with shares trading at a fair multiple, while operating in long-term growth markets, appeal was luring as a breakthrough of its promising proton therapy development could provide icing on the cake.Varian is a technology-based healthcare business which back in 2014 (when I last looked at the shares) operated under three major business units: an oncology business, an imaging components and particle therapy treatment. Actual products include Varian accelerators, X-Ray tubes and digital flat panels, among others, as the wild card was the particle therapy with proton projects.Each of the three segments in which the company was active at the time saw solid mid to high single-digit long-term demand growth which makes for a diversified and long-term investment case. The company generated $3.05 billion in sales at the time and was very profitable with operating earnings coming in at $571 million, for margins equal to 19% and that is even after a small settlement.The reason for my argument that shares were fairly valued was quite straightforward. Trading around the $80 mark and with GAAP earnings coming in at $4 per share, multiples were modest especially if we consider that the company operated with a net cash position equal to about $5 per share. Hence, we were dealing with a long-term growth play trading at a high double-digit earnings multiple while the balance sheet was rock solid, all enough reasons to be upbeat and buy on dips.Those dips did arrive as I bought some shares in the mid-seventies that year, with shares even trading in their sixties as 2015 was a year of flattish revenue and earnings trends.Exciting news arrived in 2016 as the company announced the spin-off of the imaging business while the core business showed growth, yet for two years in a row this growth has been a bit underwhelming, at least trending below the long-term potential. With the spin-off in Varex (NASDAQ:VREX) closing, investors in Varian were granted 0.4 shares in that new business for every share in Varian. With the spin-off of Varex taking place at around $30 per share, that holding was worth around $12 per share, although that valuation has fallen to just about $6 at this point in time.2017 results again showed modest growth at low single-digit rates, as sales of nearly $2.7 billion were much lower than the company generated in 2014, of course, a result of the Varex spin-off. By 2019, revenues had steadily risen to $3.2 billion again following growth at the core oncology business. While this is to be applauded, the proton solutions is still quite small with revenues of less than $150 million, making up just around 5% of sales, as it seemed that this technology did not live up to its full potential.With the company reporting adjusted earnings of $4.63 per share in 2019, investors had only seen 15% cumulative earnings per share growth over the past five years as a net cash position had largely been evaporated. While investors furthermore had obtained a stake in Varex, that was only worth $12 per share in terms of Varian at the start of 2020 and just $6 by now.Nonetheless, investors in Varian have seen reasonable returns as shares traded at $150 at the start of the year, thereby having doubled in the time frame of just around 5 years, all while earnings per share rose just around 15%. That means that most of the share price gains are driven by valuation multiple inflation, driven by interest rate compression and investors liking the predictability of the business. That said, sales growth accelerated to 10% in 2019 as the company guided for similar growth in 2020 with earnings coming in at $5.30-$5.45 per share (of course, all pre-Covid-19).Following the spin-off of Varex, Varian has seen an improved growth profile even as the proton business is not delivering to the extent that some investors might have thought a few years ago.The accelerating momentum has attracted Siemens Healthineers to acquire the company in a $16.4 billion cash deal, with Siemens willing to pay $177.50 per share which marks a steep 42% premium over the average price over the past 30 days and a 24% premium over the last trading price ahead of the transaction being announced.The premium is a bit rich with a $34 per share premium being offered, translating into a near $3.1 billion premium in actual dollar terms. Siemens Healthineers likes the deal as it will create a multi-disciplinary healthcare leader across the globe with the most comprehensive cancer care portfolio. This includes an integrated platform to address cancer care, ranging from screening, diagnosis, care delivery to post-treatment survivorship.Investors in Siemens Healthineers act with some reserve as the company is paying quite a steep price, of course, at around 33 times anticipated earnings originally foreseen for 2020, with real risks to that guidance. Siemens Healthineers guided for 2025 synergies of $300 million or more, comprised out of roughly a third in costs synergies and two-thirds of revenue synergies.With synergies mostly to be generated on the revenue side and only being achieved five years from now, investors in Siemens Healthineers are cautious as shares fell from $44 to $41 upon announcement of the deal. This marks a reduction in the value of the firm equal to the tune of the premium paid for Varian.With the proton therapy not having made its definitive breakthrough yet and a great deal of the run-up of the valuation of Varian the result of valuation multiple inflation rather than actual sales and earnings growth, I would be a very happy investor in Varian at this point in time. After all, investors stand to land a big payday in a very uncertain period of time.Unfortunately, I sold my small position, which I initiated in the $70s, in the low $100s in 2017 on the back of the increasing valuation multiples. Here and now there is much to like in accepting the offer if I were to be an investor at this point. That said, Siemens Healthineers has just taken a great opportunity to create a global healthcare giant, one which I will follow with great interest in the coming years, although the dealmaking and associated pricing seems quite aggressive."
4363977,24361,2020-08-03T20:36:13-04:00,"Siemens Healthineers and Varian announced a deal whereby Siemens Healthineers will acquire the world-leading radiation oncology company for $16.4B in cash.Varian is not only the market leader in radiation oncology systems but also the leader in radiation oncology software and services and has been making increasing investments in AI capabilities.Siemens Healthineers expects positive accretion in year one and meaningful synergies by 2025.Varian shareholders are getting a reasonable price, but Siemens Healthineers can still benefit from this deal over the long term.","I don't think anybody will accuse Siemens Healthineers (OTCPK:SMMNY) (SHLG.XE) (""SHLG"") of ""half measures"". Management of this large European healthcare company decided to address one of the major end-market gaps in the business (oncology treatment) in a big way, announcing a $16.4 billion cash deal for Varian (VAR), the global leader in radiation oncology systems.Although some of the valuation multiples on the deal do in fact look quite robust, the deal really isn't that expensive when you consider Varian's superior growth rate, margins, and market share position in the radiation oncology space, not to mention the potential cost and revenue synergies. I see only a token risk that this deal does not go through, though I do think Siemens Healthineers' synergy expectations for the first 12-24 months could be a little ambitious, and I believe this is a good deal over the long term for SHLG shareholders.SHLG and Varian announced that Varian's board accepted a $177.50/share ($16.4 billion in total) all-cash bid for the company, with an anticipated deal close in 2021. SHLG is paying about 4.95x forward (next twelve months) revenue and about 27x forward EBITDA. That price represents a 24% premium to the prior close, and SHLG intends to finance the deal with a 50/50 mix of stock and debt. SHLG's majority owner Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) does not intend to participate in the stock offering, which should reduce its ownership of SHLG from 85% to 72%.While the multiple SHLG is paying looks steep, and I believe that's a big part of the reason that SHLG shareholders weren't initially overjoyed with the announcement, I don't actually think the price is so unreasonable.Varian has generated roughly 11% revenue growth in recent years and continues to take share in the radiation oncology space (largely from Elekta (OTCPK:EKTAY), but also, ironically, from old Siemens units). With underlying growth in global oncology treatments as well as new product, software, and service introductions, I expect five-year revenue growth on the order of 9% and operating income growth in the low-to-mid teens, with EBITDA margin rising to the 20%'s.Putting that all into my med-tech valuation model (which is driven primarily by revenue growth and margins), I get a fair forward revenue multiple of around 4.5x - suggesting SHLG is ""overpaying"" by about 10% - which isn't unreasonable as a takeover multiple, and doesn't factor in the potential synergies of the deal.Oncology treatment was a significant gap in SHLG's portfolio, and expansion into this market makes considerable sense to me, given the size of the market - over $5.5 billion today for radiation oncology, with a much larger target addressable market - and the growth potential in markets like China. As an aside, Siemens was in this market for a number of years before exiting the market back in 2010.First, SHLG is acquiring the market leader. Elekta has been struggling for some time, and I'm skeptical that its recent move into MRI-guided radiation therapy will change much, and smaller players like Accuray (ARAY) and ViewRay (VRAY) aren't much of a threat. Most radiation oncologists (particularly in the U.S.) are taught and trained on Varian systems, and they're a tough competitor to dislodge.Second, I see some meaningful potential synergies on both cost and sales. Combining these two companies will give both sides access to customers that they previously didn't do much business with, with SHLG likely opening doors in Europe for Varian, and Varian opening doors in markets like the U.S. and China.An even bigger potential synergy should emerge on the product development front. SHLG is a leader in imaging technology, while Varian is a leader in radiation delivery, and that should drive R&D savings down the road (the two companies already collaborate on imaging). Both companies have also been investing resources in areas like AI and machine learning, including Varian's Ethos AI-driven solution, and there should be R&D synergies here as well. Likewise, on the software/service side, as Varian had already begun its transition toward what it calls an ""oncology as a service"" model.SHLG sees meaningful synergies down the road, asserting that the deal will be accretive in the first 12 months and produce material synergies by Year 2, with a 2025 goal of EUR 300M-plus in savings. I think the accretion expectations for the first year or two might be aggressive, but I do see this as an accretive deal in time.As far as negatives go, I don't see too many beyond normal integration/execution challenges. I see little risk on the anti-trust side, and SHLG management has experience integrating deals. The biggest risks are likely market risks. This (2020) isn't a great time for hospital capex, and the impact of COVID-19 on hospital capex budgets could linger a little while longer. There are also reimbursement challenges in the U.S., but I think Varian's product, software, and service development (including hypofractionation and software designed to shrink setup and treatment times) address those challenges quite well.I can't say that Varian shareholders are getting a bad deal here, but I can also understand why they may feel that the premium isn't all it could have been when companies like Stryker (SYK) trade at over 5x forward revenue. Likewise, I can understand if SHLG shareholders look at the premium paid (particularly out of context) and worry that the company is significantly overpaying. I believe this will be a successful deal, though, and I think it will benefit SHLG and its shareholders over time, while Varian investors have the far less desirable task of finding a new investment option of similar quality trading at a reasonable valuation."

Listen to or subscribe to Behind the Idea on these podcast platforms:Last week, I was on the hot seat pitching Stitch Fix (SFIX) as a long idea. This week, Mike takes his turn. His thesis is on Varian Medical Systems (VAR), which is a more established company by a long shot, but there's an element of paying up for quality here as well. Here's Mike's thesis from our notes, as background to the podcast you can listen to above.Varian sells machines to doctors so they can zap patients’ cancers with radiation in hopes of killing the cancer.I think the key thing to understand about this company and its business is that radiation oncology is a complex and highly specialized medical practice with a great risk to the patient. To be successful, a radiation oncologist must continually update their understanding not just of how cancer grows and spreads within a person’s body but also their understanding of how radiation can be targeted at cancer.Administration of radiation therapy is a highly complex, multi-step process. It requires a multi-person team, all of whom must precisely coordinate their roles. Says Varian:Meanwhile, the function of radiation as a treatment is quite hazardous. Radiation is a weapon that scrambles DNA and causes cellular death. Here’s Varian’s description:In my opinion, the complexity and danger inherent to this technology creates a need for consistency, which makes it difficult for users to switch among competitors and creates a high degree of stability in the customer base. These are highly attractive attributes, as they contribute to pricing power (customers would rather pay up than switch) and earnings stability (customers are to some degree trapped within Varian’s system). Meanwhile, there is not a strong concentration of customers, according to Varian, who says that no customer accounts for more than 10% of total revenues.As a side note, the radiation oncology business is, like many in the U.S. health system, optimized for operational efficiency and throughput. Varian understands this and guides its products toward reduced patient time in system and more services rendered (and billed), which adds to the value of the machines to Varian’s customer base and further boosts pricing power (you’re willing to pay more for a machine that actively helps you generate revenue faster).Varian seems to be working toward providing an end-to-end solution, but its objective is to provide an open system where Varian devices can mix and match with other systems and technologies.On top of all this, accelerators for radiation therapy qualify as medical devices and are regulated by the FDA, which creates a strong entry barrier.In terms of the market, unfortunately for humanity cancer is a growing market. According to Varian,Varian goes on to say,Varian’s position in the market appears strong."
4262783,101421,2019-05-10T17:50:59-04:00,"Varian Medical Systems has acquired CyberHeart for an undisclosed sum.Cyberheart has been developing the use of radiation to correct chronic heart arrhythmias.With Varian's focus on radiation technologies, the deal makes strategic sense as it seeks to stay abreast of the latest technology potential for the cardiac space.","Varian (VAR) announced it has acquired CyberHeart for an undisclosed amount.CyberHeart has intellectual property that covers cardiac radioablation - the use of radiation to scar or destroy tissue in the heart that is facilitating faulty electrical signals, causing an abnormal heart rhythm.With the deal, VAR is adding promising radiation-based technologies for correcting chronic cardiac arrhythmia conditions.Mountain View, California-based CyberHeart was founded in 2006 and is the first company to develop a non-invasive, robotic cardiac ablation therapy for the treatment of heart arrhythmias with radiation that is delivered through CyberKnife systems.Management is headed by CEO Rod Young, and one of CyberHeart’s directors is Thomas Fogarty, M.D., a prolific medical device innovator in the cardiovascular space.Investors have invested $24.8 million in the company and include Emergent Medical Partners, Mitsubishi UFJ Capital, and United Investments. Source: CrunchbaseCyberHeart operates in the cardiovascular segment of the radiofrequency ablation devices market which, according to a market research report by Grand View Research, is projected to reach $6.7 billion by 2026.This represents a CAGR of 11.6% between 2019 and 2026.The main drivers for this expected growth are the rising healthcare expenditure, growing geriatric population and the increasing preference for minimally-invasive therapies.The cardiology and cardiac rhythm management segment is expected to grow at the fastest rate due to cardiovascular disease prevalence, rising awareness, and adoption of minimally invasive operations in the sector.Competitive vendors that are developing or provide radiation therapies include:Source: SentieoVarian didn’t disclose the acquisition price or terms and didn’t file a form 8-K or provide a change in financial guidance, so the deal was likely for a financially non-material amount, probably for under $50 million.A review of the firm’s most recent 10-Q filing indicates that as of March 29, 2019, Varian had $546.3 million in cash and equivalents and $1.65 billion in total liabilitiesFree cash flow for the six months ended March 29, 2019, was $102.3 million.In the past 12 months, VAR’s stock price has risen 13.74% vs. much smaller ViewRay’s (VRAY) rise of 16.32%, as the chart below indicates:Source: SentieoManagement has produced earnings beats for seven of the last twelve quarters:Source: Seeking AlphaAnalyst ratings are split between various outcomes and the consensus price target of $140.89 represents an implied upside potential of 5.6% from the stock’s current price of $133.36 at press time: Source: Seeking AlphaAnalyst sentiment in earnings calls has risen since the second half of 2018, as the linguistic analysis chart shows below:Source: SentieoVarian has acquired CyberHeart’s IP for its radioablation technology, which has shown promise in early clinical studies to reduce chronic cardiac arrhythmias.As Dee Khuntia, Chief Medical Officer at Varian stated in the deal announcement,With Varian’s focus on radiation-based medicine technologies, the deal makes strategic sense as first-in-man studies of radioablation have been published.While it won’t move the needle for Varian’s stock in the short-term, management is smart to capitalize on acquiring IP for new technologies that it can move through the regulatory process and into field use."
4161469,102293,2018-04-06T12:59:45-04:00,"There is much scope to grow in the radiotherapy market across the world.Innovative products such as Halcyon platform and HyperArc platform are expected to drive Varian's growth in 2018.Varian is leveraging its software and services capability to transition from a product based company to one providing integrated human-centered cancer treatment.Varian is already a leader in the upcoming proton therapy segment.However, certain company-specific risks have to be considered while investing in Varian.","A global leader in the radiation oncology segment, Varian Medical Systems (VAR) is now striving hard to transform itself from a product company to an integrated human-centered cancer treatment provider. And the long-term strategy of the company is to expand its addressable market size from $7.3 billion in 2017 to $12.3 billion by the year 2022 by focusing on patient-centered care coordination. This will ultimately result in meaningful footprint expansion for Varian Medical Systems, not only in new segments but also in new geographies.I strongly believe that today, Varian Medical Systems is in a sweet spot, all set to capitalize on existing as well as new opportunities in radiation oncology segment, in both developed and developing economies. The target price of $130, set by Barrington Research in January 2018, seems more reflective of the true potential of this stock.While the company's current share price may not be a very attractive entry point, it is definitely a point where you want existing investors to hold on to this stock to enjoy some nice returns in the coming months.In this article, I will be explaining my hypothesis for recommending Varian Medical Systems as a hold opportunity for 2018, in greater detail.The global radiation therapy market seems to be picking up, growing at 4.5% (linked above) in the 12 trailing months from October 2016 to September 2017, and Varian Medical Systems is well placed to capitalize on this opportunity. The company boasted of an installed base of 7,876 linac units (linked above) at end of Q1 2018 and expects to grow this number to 10,000 by the year 2022. The company also plans to expand its annually treated patient base from 3 million to 6 million (linked above).There are many growth drivers in the oncology segment that can prove favorable for Varian Medical Systems in achieving its long-term target. The increasing aging population in emerging markets, rising incidence of cancer, and relative under-penetration of radiotherapy in these markets is a key short-term growth driver for Varian Medical Systems. In developed markets, it is mostly the aging installed base, around 1,000 systems over 10 years old (linked above) in USA alone, that is fueling the company's replacement business. Coupled with these drivers, is Varian's winning strategy comprising of innovative hardware and software products and services for care continuum that is playing pivotal role in strengthening the company's position in the radiation oncology market.Varian Medical Systems has already been witness to strong growth trends in Asia Pacific market, which includes Japan, China, and other geographies in south-east Asia. In China, the company has been seeing rapid uptake for its Edge product as well as Aria software.Approved by the FDA in June 2017, Halcyon system is an image-guided volumetric intensity-modulated radiotherapy or IMRT device, designed to provide cost-effective cancer services across the world. Halcyon has also received CE mark from European regulatory authorities. The company has managed to secure around 62 orders for this device across the world (linked above), of which, 40% arise from greenfield sites.What has been differentiating this linac device from bunch of other devices in the market, is its small footprint and cost effectiveness, all done without compromising on quality. So, the small size will be playing a pivotal role in placing Halcyon in developed markets of USA and Western Europe, where almost 90% to 95% of the demand is from the replacement segment (linked above). Here, Halcyon is being positioned to replace the aging linac devices, including around 2,000 cobalt devices (linked above), Tomotherapy devices, as well as Siemens devices. Unlike TruBeam which was too big, Halcyon's small size, capable of fitting in older vaults, is the key differentiator in this case. Then again, the advanced capabilities such as kilovoltage cone CT imaging in Halcyon will enable Varian to pursue higher-priced opportunities in developed markets.Halcyon's small size has also reduced construction time required to construct new vaults, in case of greenfield orders. Additionally, the device reduces per patient treatment time to almost half of that required with previous devices and hence, also improves overall throughput. Then again, unlike older devices which would require almost 31 button clicks, Halcyon requires only 9 clicks for functioning. The reduced amount of human intervention implies reduced probability of wrong decisions, thereby, improving quality as well as safety for patients.Here, we have mostly concentrated on the evolution of Halcyon's growth trajectory in developed markets. But it is the emerging markets, where lies most of the accounts that have never deployed radiotherapy before. Out of the 62 orders placed till date for Halcyon (linked above), almost 40% has been from emerging markets. And with 90% of these orders (linked above) from those accounts that never had a linac device, company is making a big difference in this underpenetrated segment in future years.Going beyond Halcyon's current capabilities, Varian is also planning to imbibe adaptive radioactive therapy, one that changes with patients and tumors, in the Halcyon system. This involves multi-modal imaging technology at the point of care, iterative cone-beam CT for appropriate dose distribution, and accurate dosage delivery.Going beyond products, Varian Medical Systems has developed a HyperArc, an end-to-end solution that when combined with potential of TrueBeam® and Eclipse™ platforms, is capable of providing advanced high definition intracranial radiosurgery solution. We now have people upgrading their TrueBeam and Eclipse installed base to the new HyperArc solution, which costs almost $1.0 million (linked above). For new systems, the cost per HyperArc solution is almost $2.5 million (linked above). The company has managed to secure almost 57 orders for HyperArc (linked above), since its launch in late 2016.In addition to the large installed base that can be upgraded with HyperArc, Varian is also targeting a large opportunity in product and service margin segment, associated with HyperArc. Combining all the factors with the rapidly rising prevalence of brain cancer patients and subsequent demand for stereotactic radiosurgery solutions, HyperArc is expected to prove to be a revenue opportunity of around $300 million for Varian by year 2022.Varian Medical Systems offers a host of software solutions, aiming to help the dosimetrist and clinician create the most optimal treatment plan for patients. Prominent amongst these is Eclipse, which had a strong franchise of around 3,900 independent customers in mid 2017 (linked above). The recently launched knowledge-based software, RapidPlan, has also witnessed almost doubling of installed base in Q1 2018 as compared to Q1 2017.Varian Medical Systems is now focusing on getting orders for upgrading the installed Eclipse base with HyperArc solution and RapidPlan software. Today, Eclipse software comes with multi-criteria optimization capability, which can work with RapidPlan to create flexible and optimal customized treatment plans. Further, Varian has also introduced a graphics processing unit in Eclipse, to improve calculation efficiency and thereby, productivity of the radiation technology. All these changes and upgrades in the treatment planning systems present an incremental revenue opportunity of around $250 million (linked above) for the company, by the year 2022.Beyond the treatment planning software, Varian Medical Systems also offers workflow management and decision support software such as ARIA, InSightive, Velocity, and 360 Oncology, in a relatively underpenetrated global market. So ARIA and the various localized versions that are being developed for foreign markets help customers to better comply with healthcare regulations in those specific geographies. InSightive works in combination with ARIA to provide financial and clinical analytics capabilities to customers.360 Oncology can prove to be a major opportunity for Varian Medical Systems in the yet underpenetrated cancer care coordination segment. This market is worth more than $1.0 billion (linked above), and every 100 new customers for 360 Oncology effectively represent a revenue opportunity of around $20 million. 360 Oncology is enabling digitization and thereby, simplifying the working of the multi-disciplinary tumor board. Further, it is also enhancing the degree of patient engagement and finally, emerging as integrated system for cancer patient care.In Q1 2018, Varian Medical Systems' longitudinal cancer imaging software, Velocity, reported double digit growth on YoY basis. This software plays a pivotal role as a tool in determining effectiveness of treatment and monitoring of cancer patients, based on images obtained from disparate sources.Already a leader in proton therapy segment, Varian Medical Systems has recently launched the ProBeam Compact proton therapy, which is more efficient in targeting tumors and having less impact on the neighbouring tissues as compared to other external beam systems. The company is also preparing to leverage the huge underserved market opportunity for proton therapy in the Chinese market.Varian Medical Systems has also made its foray in the rapidly growing interventional oncology segment, by acquiring radioembolization leader and Australia-based Sirtex. This company has added SIR-Spheres Y-90 resin microspheres, a targeted internal radiation therapy, already used in around 1,040 centers in 40 countries across the world, to treat certain inoperable liver cancers. This deal has been priced at around $1.3 billion (linked above).Although a global leader in proton therapy segment, Varian Medical Systems is anticipating both revenue and margin volatility for this business in coming quarters, since the company is currently ramping up its operational base. Then again, the competition in this segment from companies such as Sumitomo, Ion Beam Applications (OTCPK:IOBCF), Hitachi (OTCPK:HTHIY), and Mevion Medical Systems is rising rapidly, and hence Varian will have to continue to invest heavily for maintaining its leadership position. Hence, we can expect margins to remain low for the company's proton therapy business in coming quarters.In the context of the entire radiation oncology segment, Varian Medical Systems is competing with major electronics players such as Philips (NYSE:PHG) and Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) as well as with niche radiation oncology companies such as Accuray (NASDAQ:ARAY) and Elekta (OTCPK:EKTAY). Increasing competition implies continued pricing pressures for Varian Medical Systems in future quarters.Varian Medical Systems is currently trading at a PE multiple of 28.46x, which is definitely not cheap considering that the average PE multiple for the radiation therapy industry is 17.2x. This valuation can be justified by the strong business fundamentals and robust growth prospects. The company has total debt close to $340.0 million and total cash worth $836.6 million on its balance sheet. Varian Medical Systems also had net operating cash flow close to $495.9 million at the end of 2017.In this context, the company's strong balance sheet can help Varian to return shareholder value either through dividends or share repurchases.Considering all these aspects together, I believe that retail investors should definitely consider Varian Medical Systems as a robust investment opportunity in FY 2018."
4031749,101543,2016-12-20T13:48:23-05:00,Varian Medical Systems is spinning off its X-ray component manufacturer business.An investment pre-spin-off doesn't appear beneficial.The new company name will be Varex Imaging.,"Varian Medical Systems (NYSE:VAR) spin-off is getting closer to completion. The company has filed its separation and distribution agreement which you can find here. The filing still doesn't give details into exactly what the distribution ratio will look like. The spin-off is planned to be a tax-free distribution. I expect it to be completed in the first quarter of 2017. The new company name will be Varex Imaging.OverviewVarex is basically a component manufacturer for X-ray equipment. It provides X-ray tubes, flat panel detectors, imaging software, high-voltage connectors and high-energy inspection accelerators.Source: Investor PresentationThe top costumers for Varex are large OEMs, and some of these parts are key components in CT scanners, radiographic or fluoroscopic imaging, special procedures, and mammographies. Varex's largest customer is Toshiba Medical Systems (OTCPK:TOSBF), and accounts for 26% of the revenue, which is a concern. There would be a material loss to company if these two companies decided to end their relationship with each other.The healthcare components market growth is driven by clinical needs/research, growing access to healthcare and of course, the aging population. The United States alone is in a growth stage for the aging population and 65 and older age group is expected to double over the next 40 years. Some markets are quite mature though, and investors should only expect to see low-single digit growth as an overall industry.I would also like to note that these components are used in industrial markets such as X-ray imaging for security and cargo inspections. Government demand and policies will drive the growth of this segment. Over the past three years, the industrial segment revenue only equated to 10% of total revenue, and has seen year-over-year declines. A Trump presidency could bring beneficial policies on securing borders, which could correlate into increased revenue.ValuationSource: GurufocusMany competitors don't have the total portfolio that Varex offers under one roof. Both companies above compete against Varex in key components which are X-ray tubes and X-ray detectors. PerkinElmer (NYSE:PKI) is probably the best comparable, especially since General Electric (NYSE:GE) has a plethora of other revenue segments and is consider a large-cap stock, but still, the numbers don't look too far apart from a valuation basis.These valuation comparables will give us a general idea of the value of the company, and hopefully, the company trades within these ranges post spin-off. Below, I used the lower of the two valuation multiples to get a more conservative number.Source: Investor Presentation & Created by AuthorOne thing that is concerning is the amount of free cash flow the company produces. For 2016 and 2015, these numbers came in at $44 million and $51 million, respectively. I know this is a manufacturing company, so it's not a capital-light business. Cash will keep going out the door for inventory, but it's something to be aware of.From an investment prospective pre spin-off, there doesn't appear to be any value. VAR already sells at a pretty high P/E ratio, and as Varex is spun-off, the assets don't seem attractive enough to drive the multiple higher. Varex has struggled to grow top line and bottom line numbers over the past few years. It has shown a glimmer of hope over the last two quarters posting strong numbers, but this doesn't change my valuation just yet. I am interested in the company post spin-off and seeing if there is any selling pressure from institutions or retail investors. For investors, I would wait to see what the market values these companies post spin-off, to see if it creates a buying opportunity.To read more research on stock spin-offs, fund holdings, micro-cap companies, and special situations please consider following me (by clicking the ""Follow"" button at the top of this article next to my name) to receive notification when I publish research next."
4112717,102896,2017-10-10T14:09:36-04:00,"By spinning off Varex Imaging, Varian has been able to focus on excelling in radiotherapy, where it possesses a strong moat and over 50% of market share.Varian's financial strength enables it to continue investing heavily in R&D to sustain its intellectual property rights advantage, with potential growth drivers in treatment planning software and radio-oncology proton therapy.Varian's strong fundamentals and moat make it watch-list worthy.","Varian Medical Systems (VAR) enjoys dominant market share and extensive intellectual property rights in radiotherapy which will combine to drive continued strong growth for years to come. Given its strong market position and pristine balance sheet, VAR is a great business that investors should follow and add at an attractive price.Varian wisely spun off Varex Imaging (VREX) earlier this year, enabling it to focus solely on its strongest business component - radiotherapy - where it benefits from a dominant market share position (greater than 50% internationally and ~70% in the U.S.) as well as significant barriers to entry through its R&D prowess (no new entrants into the business in over ten years). It shares the market with virtually only one major competitor (Elekta with approximately 25% global market share), and their combined economies of scale and barriers to entry should grow their combined market share even further in the coming years as smaller competitors are unable to compete with Varian's and Elekta's superior R&D and production scale. VAR's pristine balance sheet (0.18 Debt to Equity ratio and positive NCAV) should further sustain its R&D competitive advantage by allowing the company to continue investing heavily in bringing cutting-edge technology to market.Strong growth forecasts for the radiotherapy market should limit competitive pricing pressures between the two firms. According to a recent report by BCC Research, the radiation therapy market is expected to achieve a 6.4% CAGR to reach nearly $10 Billion in total sales by 2022. The chief growth drivers are expected to be growing demand in developing countries (where Asia is significantly underutilized and is growing rapidly as supply catches up with demand), equipment replacement in developed countries, and improving technologies and efficiency. VAR plans to capitalize on these trends through recent advances in its radiotherapy equipment (Halcyon) and software (Eclipse 15.5) technologiesOne of the latest products of Varian's robust R&D program - the Halcyon radiotherapy system - is poised to help the company achieve its growth objectives in emerging markets. Its cost and time efficiency, as well as its user-friendly platform for both staff and patients, will likely be popular in lower-income/less-experienced medical markets.SourceAfter receiving its 510(K) clearance and CE Mark from the European directive, VAR can already sell the system in Europe and the U.S., while management expects to clear regulatory hurdles in East Asian powerhouses China and Japan within the next 12 months or so. Furthermore, the company is garnering demand for the system from major economies such as Australia, India, Russia, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.Another recently developed growth driver for Varian is its Eclipse 15.5 Oncology Treatment Planning System, which has also received 510(K) approval. This system provides best-in-class treatment plan efficiency (RapidPlan) and precision through its improved GPU, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) optimization, and multi-criteria optimization (MCO) capabilities while also supporting VAR's new HyperArc High Definition Radiotherapy system. Varian's Eclipse 5.5 has graphics processing unit (or GPU) support for faster plan development. The feature enables clinicians to calculate optimum intermediate dose with IMRT (intensity modulated radiation therapy) optimization. Furthermore, the HyperArc feature provides significantly enhanced capabilities for performing complex stereotactic radiosurgery.VAR's valuation is currently above historical and market averages, implying that the market has factored in its strong growth prospects (analysts forecast 10% annual growth over the next five years):Looking at VAR's DCF valuation based on analyst forecasts yields a similar conclusion (~9.5% projected annual returns):SourceVAR is clearly a great company and in a strong position to enjoy strong growth for the foreseeable future. Its market share in its niche sector is dominant and it has the deep pockets, intellectual property rights portfolio depth and breadth, and years of experience to maintain its lead in R&D. Furthermore, it is bringing products to market that fit in well with its strategic targeting of emerging markets to drive further growth. However, its current premium valuation leaves investors with little a margin of safety to achieve market-beating returns. I recommend GARP investors add VAR to their watch list and wait for a pullback of 10-20% before initiating/adding to their positions."

We break it down.","Editors' Note: This is the transcript of last week's a podcast on Varian Medical Systems. We hope you enjoy it.Mike Taylor: Welcome to Behind The Idea. I'm Mike Taylor.Daniel Shvartsman: And I'm Daniel Shvartsman.MT: It's another Gone Till November episode, this month, November, we are taking a look at our own ideas instead of sitting like the two old guys in the box on the Muppet Show who heckle what everyone else does. Now we're getting down and dirty in the weeds, doing our own work and standing by for good or evil.Last week, Daniel pitched Stitch Fix ticker symbol SFIX. And it was kind of a big moment for him because he was showed some openness to the growth in tech stocks. I call it really amazing work by one of the true original value hipsters. So check that episode out. This week it's my turn and then we'll wrap up our Gone Till November month with an episode reviewing bad calls that we've made in the past, believe it or not, we've made bad calls in the past, Shopify. And then the last Gone Till November episode will be a conclusions and the lessons learned episode. It will also be our hundredth episode. Nice big round number. Nice being round thoughts to go with that big round.So what am I doing? I am pitching Varian ticker symbol, VAR. A bull case on a high multiple stock. Varian makes radiation therapy machines and related software for the treatment of cancer. The company has huge market share, a big note and I think balance sheet flexibility that reflects a great deal of embedded shareholder value. I have been driving myself absolutely crazy making models, copying things out of the 10-K, doing that thing where you write in the investor presentation in red ink, using arrows and stuff. But at the end of all that I am long, VAR.So all right. Before we get into it, Behind The Idea is the podcast that looks at what makes great investment analysis work. We take articles from the Seeking Alpha ecosystem, books by Joel Greenblatt, activist shareholder letters, blog post by Ray Dalio and now our own portfolios, and try to break them down to understand the approach and how to apply these approaches in other situations.Nothing on this podcast, especially this podcast, should be taking as investment advice of any sort. As I said, I am long at VAR. Daniel is long, Stitch Fix (SFIX), though who knows maybe I'll get him started on the right track, get him selling his Stitch Fix, selling short his Stitch Fix and then going levered long VAR, which is by far the more intriguing investment as you will soon see.Listen to or subscribe to Behind the Idea on these podcast platforms:Okay, one more thing, Daniel.DS: We'll see about that.

Mike.MT: Great, I like we both -- listen listeners, we write down a few thoughts to start out the episode and then we try and ad lib as we're reading those thoughts back. And sometimes it goes well and sometimes it goes off the rails. And I think we had a little bit of both for each of us this time, but and here's more of it. So…DS: Varian, yes.MT: Just a little bit of inside, Varian.DS: Varian Medical Systems is the full name of the company, Varian Medical Systems.MT: That's news to me. Get ready to listen to my long idea.DS: Please, I mean…MT: Well, let me just, I'll just start talking. So I'm feeling a little kind of like Daniel little growth, the little high quality, a little not value at the moment, which is probably the contrarian indicators and all contrarian indicators. But I'm feeling a little Einhorn 2009 before things got a little tougher for guy David. He pitched Microsoft. And he basically he made an analogy to fantasy baseball draft. He said, sometimes you just have to pay up for the best player. You have to pay a little more to get someone who's really going to bring you winner in. At that time, Microsoft was that stock, was that company. And I haven't looked lately, but based on what I've seen on Twitter and heard around, word on the Street, Microsoft is fairly well reputed to be an excellent investment past 10 years and sort of since inception.And I'm now making a similar case with Varian, a company that I do think is moaty, to use a awesome term. That I think has a lot of long term earnings power and even maybe some hidden stuff underneath a sort of superficially high multiple, at least from a stodgy value perspective.So why do I think that? Let's go over first of all the business case for Varian and its strategic positioning. So like I said Varian sells these radiation machines that zap people's cancers. And I think the most important thing to understand about these machines and cancer treatment with radiation is that it's a very complex, very highly specialized medical practice with great risk to the patients.So you're firing nuclear particles at a person in hopes of shrinking, destroying their cancer. The problem with firing nuclear particles at a person is the person also has healthy living tissue. And if you miss and you shoot nuclear particles at healthy living tissue, it does the same thing that it does to cancer, which is it engineers cell death. It basically breaks apart the DNA and makes it impossible for the cells to go on living.So Varian's customers, which are medical service providers, also known as doctors, they need these machines, they need to understand how these machines work, they need a high degree of precision and specificity and consistency from the experience. And they need to sort of continually be updating themselves on the latest treatment modalities and the machinery needs to be adaptable to new developments in the field of radiation therapy.So, all of that leads to a high degree of specialization within the machinery. And I think a lot of stickiness from the customer base. It means that doctors are just like they need to use machines they are familiar with. Hey need machines that can cater to this highly specific skill set. The machines again shoot nuclear particles at people. That's not something that's easily replicable.So to me, this business has just this enormous barrier to entry. You need the scientific sophistication, you need to have a brand that's reputable with physicians who do some very challenging work, combating a disease that's meaningfully fatal to a large number of patients. This is high stake stuff, and Varian makes the machines that facilitates all of this.So that's the basic pitch of where I think the main is a sort of technological knowhow barrier to entry and a brand reputation that sort of allows Varian to have a great degree of sort of pricing power and therefore profitability.Additionally, Varian knows its customer base very well. In the U.S. where Varian is the most dominant, the healthcare system is geared primarily towards rapid treatment throughput and maximizing billing hours. And Varian says in its 10-K that this is a big part of where its innovation is pointed out is just to continually improve the patient experience, but also make it faster, make the setup times and all that stuff faster. And that's definitely a good attribute for physicians. And then not only -- and then finally, to sort of cap off the broad overview.Cancer is a large market and it's a growing market. I read in the Morningstar report that radiation therapy is actually it has a lower cost profile than new drugs do. Now they're causing benefits to the patient and all that stuff. But I think will be an enduring and potentially less vulnerable treatment modality than drugs will be to whatever happens in the US healthcare system payment issues.And on top of all that, it's a growing market. So according to Varian the number of new cancer cases diagnosed annually, will go from 14 million new cases per year in 2012 to 25 million in 2030 and they're citing a Lancet oncology report compiled by the Global Task Force on Radiotherapy for Cancer Control. Within that growing market Varian is now trying to expand internationally. And so this is a company with very strong market positioning. They account for -- they have 50% market share globally and they have more than 70% market share in the U.S., are overwhelmingly dominant. They're like a Google or similar type of entity within this market. So they have pricing power. They have dominant market position.They are in a market that's sort of organically growing for a lack of a better word. And now they're aiming at generating additional growth via installations in emerging markets and sort of throughout the globe. So overall, I think that the qualitative picture is just that Varian is excellent from basically however you want to measure a business. In terms of strategic positioning Varian would be toward the top of my list of firms.DS: Okay. So one basic business question for you or two. It's sort of two sides of the same question, I think. They -- and they are -- I'm looking at -- they just reported their fiscal year Q4. And in the 8-K -- they haven't released the 10-K yet -- they break out Oncology Systems versus Proton Solutions, and I see that they have a President of Proton Solutions, as well as their CEO and the President of Oncology Systems. In their 10-Ks and their 10-Q's, they break out, which this is quite interesting to me they break out products revenue versus service revenue.I'm just curious, what's the distinction there that you've come across or what's your take on how much does that matter that they have two different sort of lines in their income statement as far as where they're getting their revenue?MT: So if you look at the revenue breakdown, first of all good question. I'm not fully like 100% on all this, but I'll give you my best answer. So in terms of the breakdown of Oncology Systems and Proton Solutions, I think if you look at the sales breakdown between those two, it's like 95% Oncology Systems and 5% Proton Solutions. And the way management breaks those two things down is Proton Solutions is kind of this more novel emergent therapy modality that's still kind of getting worked out.It's basically their higher risk, higher potential growth play, that they're not, it's not the main focus. The main core of the business is Oncology Solutions, which is the sort of traditional types of radiation therapy that's been around for decades. And I think Proton Solutions is more novel than that. And so my temptation is to kind of you Proton Solutions as currently a pretty small part of the business and with a sort of degree of skeptical remove.I'm not sure whether it's all that meaningful in terms of its growth or even if it's all that economically viable long term. I think that's uncertain the way that management presents it. But I think it's good that they're trying to explore new, different technological applications. But I think really, the focus here is probably, at least for the next several years, going to still remain on Oncology Systems. I think that's the business that really is strong.And then you had a second question, which was services versus….DS: Product versus service.MT: Yeah. So this is complex since sort of strategically, looking through the 10-K, management presents a sort of different -- a variety of different ways of looking at all this stuff. So you got hardware, you have the machine that shoots the beam at the patient, the patient's tumor or cancer. You also -- I think I was trying to underline the complexity of that. So you basically need like a team of four or five practitioners to administer one round of radiation therapy.So you have the radiation oncologist who sort of develops the treatment plan and comes up with like, okay, we're going to dose him this much, and we're going to aim here. But then you also have in sort of general terms, you have another person who's sort of a physicist, who's in charge of sort of figuring out how the physics of the thing will work. You have someone who's sort of modeling the person's tumor and trying to figure out how to target it. And all these experts have to work together and use a variety of different software and applications to -- that go with the machine. And so I think the blend between hardware and services is kind of this Varian's trying more and more to provide a comprehensive sort of suite of goods and services that will do as much of this administration as is possible.When I first read about that I was like, oh cool, maybe they'll develop basically like an Apple type of closed system where like in Apple you have your MacBook, you have your iPod, you have iTunes and now you have the Apple credit card and like, it's an entirely closed system where you could theoretically do like a lot of your information processing needs only using Apple hardware and software.They sort of go out of their way at Varian to say that they're trying to be more adaptable to other systems and other that they hope that their hardware and software will play nice with other hardware and software and more easily integrate into people's systems whether they use something else or not. In that way, maybe they're more analogous to Microsoft in that Microsoft software can be more compatible with a large variety of different hardware and applications.I think there are strengths and weaknesses to each approach. Varian is currently saying we're not trying to create a closed system. We're trying to provide -- be as many things to as many people as possible. That's inclusive of software versus hardware. So they're not specializing down into just the machines, they're doing a lot of different things. And from what I read in the most recent report, the software business is growing faster than the hardware business as you might expect.There are just more opportunities to sort of plug into different customer needs with that wider array of things. But I can't really get into the specifics of what those offerings are because I don't really understand. So I'm kind of on a high level of understanding.DS: But so is that like a strategic aim to grow? Because the software, if we just dumb it down to that the software margins are better, which not terribly surprising. And it looks like it, you said it's growing faster. Is that like -- is there a way for that to grow, overtake the product revenue or is there got to be kind of a limit to how much -- how many services you can sell when you really still have to sell the hardware?Do you know what I'm saying -- like is that -- is there any reason to think that they could be transforming their business or is this just a continued iteration of what they're already doing?MT: That's an interesting thing about Varian. So they spun off VREX a few years ago, and I think VREX provided some kind of ancillary services, Varex Imaging Corporation, just real quick. They design and manufacture x-ray imaging components. So they had an x-ray machine business, they spun that off.I think that there is because there is this kind of customer ecosystem of all these different things that have to take place whenever you administer treatment, there feels to me like there's this kind of ebb and flow in Varian of the asset base that I could see them developing those software business and then spinning off or it becoming an emerging piece. Presumably, the hardware is vulnerable to competition in the same way that we've seen phones or computers or anything else that specialize technology, eventually, someone figures out how to do it.So my working theory is that Varian is using a variety of means to sort of get itself positioned to enter as many more markets as possible and also to make itself less vulnerable to disruption. So kind of a diversification play. But again, I think it comes down to the fact that this process is so complicated that and my read of the management perspective is that having as many ways in and having as much interoperability with whatever you provide with whatever the doctor sort of needs.Again, staying dumb, maybe the doctor has an elective machine, but needs to update the tumor modeling, 3D model software, whatever. Maybe it's like, well, Varian can now step in and say, all right, we understand, you like Elekta (OTCPK:EKTAY), fine. You just bought one a year ago, you're not going to get a new Varian machine. But guess what Varian software is interoperable with Elekta. So this is all hypothetical. I don't know if this is actually true of the product. But this is the kind of general story that I'm picking up. I think though that to directly answer your question, the main avenue of growth here is to penetrate new markets, to get into emerging markets to sort of retain and solidify the foothold in the U.S. and to do inorganic and organic growth and expand horizontally.I don't see the software -- I see the software business as facilitating that but I don't see it as like the mean. It's not being trumpeted, I don't think it's strategic.DS: It is not an end into itself to become a medical…MT: That's not my impression. But you could also see, I mean, we've seen a lot of companies transition from hardware to services. And IBM (IBM) and Microsoft (MSFT) are sort of two classic examples of repositioning themselves into new sort of tangentially related areas. And I think that what Varian is showing lately, or what they're trying to show is kind of, because they're so entrenched in their home market and what they do well, they're sort of capable of adapting and shifting around based on where the market is or where they're trying to go.And I think that's where the interoperability story comes in. It's like, okay, you're a doctor in India, and you're getting your first sort of, you're setting up your first radiation therapy practice. We can help you in any way number of ways. The important thing to Varian is that they get there, get to the new, get to the new markets.DS: What is the -- you talked about their customers, their 10-K talks about customers as sort of the hospitals or the physician, for the physician offices or whatever. What's their strategy? I want to talk about competition, because I guess that the question's to lay out the map. I think the questions are really just around how to sort of solidify that they have this moat.So what do you make of their go to market strategy of their customer relationships or what is your impression of that as far as supporting or posing a risk to your system or your position?MT: Like I said, I think that there are sort of two main considerations here. First of all, it's the customers or the hospitals and hospital administrators or physician groups that are businesses. Their main objective is to their profit maximizers. So their main constraint is time basically. They're able to bill incredibly higher rates for this type of treatment.Being a doctor pays very well. Being a private medical practice pays very well. Basically, the question for a lot of cancer doctors I think is how do you print more money faster. And the key thing that Varian focuses on in terms of the sort of business opportunity is facilitating as many treatments as possible, making the setup and the breakdown of each treatment as easy as possible, making the administration as easy as possible, and making it as comfortable as possible for the patient, take as little time as possible for the patient. But being realistic also. It's all about the throughput. It's all about, cranking cancer patients through this system of administering the therapy and moving on.And that's sort of a cynical and sad version of the reality of the customer need, and the go to market strategy of Varian's. They have long sales cycle, but they're continually iterating these processes and going out and then presenting a refined version of customers' existing machine that can do the following things a little bit better, a little bit faster.The other component, I think which is a little bit more heartwarming is that even though these business entities are the customers where Varian, the users and the people who really matter -- the decision makers, in some ways are the physicians. And they are obligated to provide great care. And this is a technically difficult and highly sophisticated treatment mode. It's not the same as giving someone a pill or an IV.Each cancer is particular to the patient, is located in a different place, is a different size, can move over the course of treatment. There are sort of different ways of attacking different types of cancers. It's the embedded knowledge that's required of these doctors and the practitioners is immense and it's ever changing. And so I think that there is a high degree of need for familiarity with the system that Varian provides. They provide the tool that facilitates this.And I think that's -- I think the proof is kind of in the market share. There's 70% market share in the U.S. I think that shows how difficult it is to compete for a new entrant to come in and compete against that. It's just -- it is not like switching from Samsung to iPhone. These are like high stakes decisions. The machines are expensive and have a long life. I think there's a lot of stickiness to the brand and there's a lot of institutional knowhow that goes into making particle accelerators that is not readily replicable.I hope that gets directly at your question, but to me, it's just like this is a fairly evident thing.DS: Yeah. I think all of these questions are going to be sort of hitting at that level in terms of, because what I'm looking at is operating margins around 15%, 16%, which is not crazy, but not bad. And they list -- I may have -- I may be understanding their competitors because they sort of break them down into different categories. Some are -- they talk about big names like Cerner (CERN), I guess for medical records, and then Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY), Philips (PHG) pops up a few times. But when they specifically talk about medical linear accelerators, they talk about Elekta and Accuray (ARAY), which they're much bigger than.MT: Yeah, Accuray is basically not -- it's almost non-existent.DS: That's not a company that's been doing well, I just…MT: SoI understand Varian to be in the radiotherapy, radiation therapy specific business line. They're effectively do awfully with Elekta. And basically Elekta has Europe, and Varian has the United States. And now there's kind of a land grab going on for the rest of the world. So it's like Coke and Pepsi or whatever. These are like industry dominant.DS: Right? So we'll get into valuation, because I guess that's probably going to be the most compelling area to kind of try to tackle this. But…MT: Yeah, it will be the toughest for me too.DS: What is the -- so the moat as you're describing it essentially, is expertise, entrenchment with customers, and just kind of being there first. Maybe just from a -- the competition maybe is not so interesting. What I'm also thinking about is you talked about the throughput and sort of the way industry. Is there any -- you may have said that this is efficacious -- effective…MT: Effective, I like that.DS: Effective is simpler, as far as treating cancer. I guess I'm just curious ultimately, we don't -- again, every time we talk about healthcare, it seems like we have to disclaim. I don't know what's going to happen with the way healthcare is paid for or doled out in the U.S. But just, is there a reason to think that a throughput-based model will be viewed with a less -- not just as something cynical but something to be concerned about? Is there any reason to think that they're ultimately not getting the job done?MT: No, the short answer to that is no, I don't think so. And the reason I don't think so is because that dynamic is in no way specific to radiation oncology. It's endemic to the entire United States hospital system. I recently became a father. It was a very throughput-oriented process to deliver my child. It was also a revenue maximizing process in some ways.And that's you have -- from the beginning of life, to the end of life, that's the way things are structured here. I don't think that that's going to fall on Varian, as heavily as it might fall on other players within the medical system. My rationale for thinking that is, again, radiation therapy, at least according to a Morningstar report that I read is cheaper than chemotherapy and some other options that are available. So I think that if we get into CMS coverage issues or Medicare for all issues or whatever, I think that the primary angle of attack is going to be on the highest mark of the highest, the least justifiable revenue drivers first. And I think that things that are relatively cost effective will be -- will face relatively less pressure in the new environment.The other thing is that I think it -- I think it's defensible. I think radiation therapy for cancer patients is defensible. It helps many of them. And on the other side on the technological innovation side, if we're talking about sea changes, this is a little bit self-biased, but I have a friend who works in radiation therapy and chemotherapy simultaneously. There's a lot of the new modalities kind of aimed at synthesizing different with treatment regimes, antibodies, chemotherapy and radiation therapy all sort of together. So I don't see this as a very vulnerable way of administering cancer care, either from a sort of payer perspective or from a technological innovation perspective.And I think if you look at -- one way to tell this, I think would be to look at Elekta's margins and there in Europe, primarily, we already talked about that a little bit, and they have 13.9%, 13.7% EBITA margins. They have slightly lower gross margins than Varian, but it's like it's 42% for Elekta versus 44% for Varian, somewhere in that. It is like the gross margin percentage just has been sticking in the 40% range.Historically, I think when there are so few players and there's that much market dominance, I think the one thing that would maybe be more concerning is kind of FTC issues probably more than medical takeover, government healthcare, whatever you want, a socialist avatar.DS: Right. Well, and that's one other sort of trivial thing here, I guess because it's not huge numbers, but they seem to have impairment charges and acquisition-related expenses, pretty much every year. I need to go back to the statements in the 10-K, but it seems like it's just a recurring thing. Doesn't seem like it's anything meaningful and it's probably what their non-GAAP is if I had to guess, but…MT: Yeah, I have that up there. So my take is to just use GAAP for this company. This is an industrial producer. It has some interesting quirks around the sales cycle and around warranties and stuff. But those things kind of to me balance each other out like -- and I think GAAP does a good job of handling those as is. So like, yeah, sure, they have bookings and they have a sort of book of business that's out for a couple of years or whatever, into the next year.But on the other side of that coin, they also have warranties for the machines, that creates liabilities. So if one half dozen, the other -- let's use actual revenue, let's use actual expenses and kind of just go with GAAP net income. And look at the cash flow situation. I had some charts that I shared with you earlier in my sort of valuation thing.And like although there is a fluctuation year-to-year, you can kind of see a 10 year pattern that's kind of the economics of business kind of -- they are unsteady and as a result, I think of the need to acquire new technologies to do R&D. R&D is ramping up right now. Management's telling a big growth story. R&D is ramping up right now. SG&A is ramping up right now.They made a huge -- they made $400 million or $500 million of acquisitions over the course of the past fiscal year. There are occasional cash needs here. But to me the overriding story is more that, that's all in service or keeping this sort of well-established business, running and sort of what has to happen. So that's true, but I don't think there's a high level of deception there.I think the GAAP versus non-GAAP there are meaningful differences there. But I basically am making all my decisions based on GAAP figures.DS: So why don't we go into the valuation because I feel, we -- readers or listeners for background, as Mike was working through this, we were kind of chatting regularly with one another trying to -- Mike was kind of working through the research process. And the valuation seemed to be your sticking point. It seemed to be, you shared a bunch of the charts, as you said, in terms of how are they using their cash, what does their free cash flow look like? What are their returns on assets, and all these other things. But then also just when we get down to it, especially for using GAAP numbers, we're talking about a stock that is trading for, I think on a GAAP basis they are in the -- I'm not sure if their 8-K reports GAAP or non-GAAP but they had $3.4 a share in earnings last year as compared to $124 share price. So we're talking about a trailing 12 months earnings of 36 times.So I think you've made a pretty compelling case for why they're not going to be able to compete it, why they're not going to be dislodged. As you said, cancer unfortunately is likely to continue to be a growth segment. So how do you get -- and I will just also add that as a share price, not that this is valuation, but the shares have been more or less flat since the beginning of 2018. So they palm --. So how do you get your head around, sort of 36 times trailing 22 time to 23 times forward PE, which I would guess is a non-GAAP number, the projected PE, what are your thoughts?MT: I think this is my Einhorn Microsoft moment. And I think what you're looking at here -- so I think that there's a lot of embedded opportunity here for a sort of expanded shareholder return. So the first thing I did was I took $3.2 billion in 2018 revenue. And I just assumed that, that could compound at 8% annually and that that's all organic growth. So that's all sort of moving into new markets.I think the year-on-year revenue increase for the fourth quarter was like 11%. So I think there's a chance that the ramp is even higher there in terms of expanding into new markets. And you can see in their slide deck kind of a map of how that's playing out so far, and it looks like there's still a lot of space for them to run around. And so kind of 8% top line growth is really conservative.And the Morningstar report I read was somewhere around 11%. I think that they were projecting out. So there's a lot of room for additional upside there. I had COGS growing at 5% every year and I think that that's just sort of the reality of how their business works.They're in a moment right now where they are doing more R&D and they're doing more SG&A than is a sort of typical of their 10 year characteristics. So SG&A historically, when they've been a little bit less growth focused than they are now has been around 14% of sales. Today, it's around 19% of sales. And R&D is -- they act like it's a majorly, but it's at 7.7% now of revenue. Let's just assume that things are going to remain competitive and they're going to have to do that.You model all this out and you get a net income growth of like 7% compounding over the next five years or so, going from net income of $310 million to $436 million in 2023. I think that that's a really solid and reliable and conservative estimate of what can happen. And that's what, like not quite 1.5x, but you get some much larger, you just get solid growth. I think that's reliable growth. And I think that in terms of the risk to the future earnings it is much lower than it is for a lot of other stocks.If you -- and you get to very fairly valued on a 22 times PE, which is you get to that on forward earnings now. I think, though, that this stock could potentially be rated higher than that based on the growth characteristics. And so if it's more of a cost co or if it's more of one of these just completely solid businesses with a very large moat and a lot of really deeply entrenched customer relationships, plus it has growth opportunities associated with it.I'm not -- this is going to sound nuts, but I'm not sure that in today's market 22 times PE is all that buck wild of evaluation. That was a long winded way of saying potentially very little, but that's kind of where I am with it. I think it's just one -- again, it's like -- this is quality, you got to pay for that today.The other thing I did was I used our Quant ratings featured on Seeking Alpha and I put in, has at least $10 billion of market cap and has valuation rating of C+, which is what Varian has according to Seeking Alpha's Quant rating system. And the companies that are -- there's like two types of companies there. There's like companies that you and I would just consider sort of gratuitously overvalued with sort of poor economics like, electronic parts of the world.And then there's Apple (AAPL), and there's Workday (WDAY). And these great, excellent companies that everyone knows are going -- like where the party line is like these companies are going to be around in 50 years. And so I think if you're aiming high then 22 times forward non-GAAP is not that bad. Maybe even that's 30 times GAAP. I still think that you're kind of in the right ballpark. And that's without getting into the balance sheet which is flexible. They have no debt. And I have a story I can tell you about that, if you want to hear it.DS: Well, I would like to point out that Screeners are a new feature on Seeking Alpha Premium PRO Plus. Screeners, they can help you form fit your confirmation bias to your thesis.MT: Which is what I'm doing.DS: It is very, very convenient. I really like that. I plugged in C Plus and I noticed for value and I noticed one or two stocks that I own that I don't feel like naming right now. But yeah, very interesting.MT: They're more on the Electronic Arts (EA) side of things.DS: Yeah, say one. But…MT: I wish we could just do them non-GAAP to GAAP thing really quick. I'm having trouble finding my slide on that.DS: Yeah. So listeners, as Mike pulls that up, I'm looking, just to give you a sense of that Screen, you can run a Screen, we have Quant scores, developed out of our New York office. There are -- yeah, you have names like Medtronic (MDT), similar industry, Lam Research (LRCX), Allstate (ALL), Oracle (ORCL) is in here, VMware (VMW). Yeah, it's quite a mix. I actually -- you might have done like, C or worse. I don't see Apple. Walmart's (WMT) on here. So yeah, it's an interesting mix. You've got some growthy names like Twilio (TWLO), but you also have some stodgy names.The top name on this list is a large conglomerate that I've often disclosed a position that I'm just lazy enough, not mentioning because I don't feel like having to add it into our discussion.MT: Okay. While you were doing that I found the GAAP to non-GAAP for 2019. And GAAP EPS is $3.38, and non-GAAP is $4.63, which is 1.28x. And if you do that, multiply that up then Varian's at 28 times GAAP earnings verses 22 times non-GAAP, assuming that that multiply is non-GAAP, which I would guess it is.So I don't know. But when you're at 22, what's…DS: What's another…MT: It's 28, I don't know.DS: That's another 6 turns. I don't know if you call it, those turns.MT: Between friends. Yeah.DS: Well, it's just -- what's interesting to me about this is just -- here's how I'm thinking about, as you say this. So you back into an earnings yield, right, a PE multiple is the inverse of an earnings yield. And so you're thinking about how many years until that earnings pays me back 10 times earnings? You get like 10 years, right?MT: Yeah.DS: But without getting into the numbers, what I'm thinking about is that ultimately, that risk curve is based on -- or that reward card is based on your risk. And if you view a firm like Varian as less risky, you're essentially saying that you're willing to go further. You're willing to extend your payback period or you're willing to -- what I mean it's like you're willing to forego two years that you would of a Cars.com or whatever.And now you have to do the same exercise with Stitch Fix. Stitch Fix is much smaller company. And so if anything is even -- and has a higher multiple and it's even riskier. And so I said 2025, which, who knows where it will be 5.5 years from now. But that's sort of on the foot like you have to make these sorts of compromises wherever you are. Even if you're buying a three time or a five time PE something's going on there. And it's usually not -- oh, the market isn't aware of this great new business; it's usually, oh, their taxes are from…MT: There is something wrong.DS: Yeah, there's something wrong. And so it's always going to be that compromise.MT: Well, but 10 year is yielding an amazing 1.86%, right now, 10 year treasury. So why doesn't earnings yield from a company that has this level of sort of risk protection, the option to generate additional growth, the capacity to even, I would say, make mistakes, say some of the recent acquisitions haven't worked out.It can fall back on this business that has just these incredibly well-indebted economics. It's got this big moat. Even if you're modeling out a 2.5% earnings yield on this company, I think there's some -- like you say, I think the risk is lower here. And you get more return than the U.S. Treasury.I do think there is some embedded value elsewhere. They have consistently bought back until recently where they've had to make some sort of bolt-ons to pursue their growth quest. But their average share repurchase history is pretty strong in like $0.5 billion range. They -- that's a ton of share repurchases for an $11 billion market cap company.Again and no debt on the balance sheet, and I think you can -- if they are a Microsoft then they can lever up, probably add close to $1 billion in debt to the balance sheet. Handle that fine. In today's debt markets they can probably get about a 3% interest rate, not meaningfully impacts full to net income. And that would be an immediate 9% additional shareholder return if they borrowed and bought back.So even if that story is not necessarily going to take place, I think the fact that the balance sheet is so flexible, and I went through a tortured process and read things backwards where I thought for a minute that they had some debt on the balance sheet. Daniel has reassured me and I really looked at things, 2019 no debt on the balance sheet.I think for a business with this kind of potential earnings stability that they've levered up in the past, they've spun off in the past and done huge buybacks in the past. I think this is a business that operates effectively has a giant moat. And I think that there is some balance sheet and shareholder transaction flexibility here that the net income numbers are probably depressed right now by the increased R&D and by the increased SG&A as they expand these new markets.If they scale that up, then potentially they dial back down to historical levels of SG&A and R&D. The net margin increases and they also have balance sheet flexibility to potentially do something really attractive for shareholders. So I think part of the story I would tell is also just that the multiple is large relative to bottom line earnings. But those are sort of in a spot right now that they haven't been historically and could revert back to a more sort of attractive yield going forward.DS: Okay. What brought you to Varian because it's what I like about it is actually pretty under the radar, it looks like no pun intended. It's a …MT: Good one.DS: I really did not intend to, but I'll take it. There's only a handful of articles on Seeking Alpha over the years. I checked Value Investors Club. There's one post from 2012. It's $11 billion. It's not a tiny company, but it's not a big one, like what made this something that caught your eye?MT: My father is a radiation oncologist. And I was -- I knew I had to do this. I was visiting him. And I asked him for stock pics which you should all do by the way, ask doctors for slide pics. It's a classic source of out performance. No, so I'm appalled by this illusion of control bias and I probably have too much of the wrong information.I hold my father in great esteem. What he does in great esteem. All that's affecting my decision making here. I probably am emotional about this. And -- but that's how I got here. So you might think - that's edge or you might think that I'm a fool for thinking I can crack this just because my dad does this stuff for a living, but that's where we are.DS: I know. It is always nice to hear an origin story. It's always nice to hear where an idea comes from.MT: Look, but -- so net income and even free cash flow, it doesn't look like a great yield here. I tortured myself over the thought of this. I will hit the buy trigger this morning. I do think that the growth story is pretty strong. I don't think that this is going to be an upward reiterating situation. I think the main risk to me is that the market is pricing in a lot of growth and shareholder return that may not be coming. But I think that there's a case where this plays out really favorably. There's pricing power embedded in any market position. There is this large organic growth. Additionally, I just think that there's a lot that could go right here.DS: Yeah. They have -- I mean, it's a steady grower, therefore get their guidance was for strong growth in 2020. And I think you've made a pretty solid…MT: No. It's okay.DS: No, I think it's an interesting case. It's a solid case for their entrenchment, not being exposed to the negative headwinds that you might have in the healthcare space. I think it's -- I'm hopeful for you, Mike. I'm looking forward to hearing how this position plays out. And I will -- I did not have Varian in my attention wheelhouse and I will put in my wheelhouse because I think it's interesting to. I don't know, the healthcare sector at large is a pretty big blind spot for me, so.MT: It's a huge blind spot for me too. But now I'm exposed to it. That's a Gilead Sciences position that, I just had shades of that. They are dominant. They're the only ones there. Gilead is a value shot. This one is at least this is not a value shot.DS: Do not repeat the same mistakes. That's it. That's how you can ask.MT: All right. Well, do you have any more questions for me? I think I pretty much nailed this one.DS: You got it. No, it was good. Thank you Mike. I enjoyed this. Let's see how it blows. So I guess the question is going to be what plays out better over the next, you pick your timeframe, 12 months, 18 months, five years, Stitch Fix or Varian? That's where I think the…MT: Let's take an initial reevaluation at the 90 day mark and we are both clear to transact.DS: Transact shares as per the Seeking Alpha compliance policy. We might have to...MT: We will evaluate that.DS: We might have tohave a Fogo de Chao meal or something.MT: All right. Let's -- should we wrap it.DS: Let's wrap it. All right. Good stuff, Mike."
2868526,63893,2015-01-31T09:27:00-05:00,"Varian's operating results were stronger than they looked, with foreign exchange effects largely hiding strong underlying international growth and durable utilization trends.My investment thesis, which was predicated upon steady international expansion, progressive demographic trends, and a robust and growing portfolio of intangible assets, still remains intact.Despite restoring my fair value estimate to former levels, I see them as fully-valued after today's price movement, and I would wait for a discount to add to my stake.","Varian Medical Systems' (NYSE:VAR) first quarter revenues and earnings were mildly above my expectations (which had been mildly adjusted downward in the previous quarter), and the outlook for the company looks mildly more favorable after this quarter than it had before. I think a small upward revision to my fair value estimate is reasonable, and I reiterate my view that the company stands to benefit from a strong competitive position within an industry that still has a long runway for growth. With shares now trading in the low $90's, though, I view the company as fairly valued and look to hold onto my shares. I am hoping to accumulate more on any price weakness.Investment Thesis:Varian stands to benefit from a confluence of powerful demographic trends, unmet need for its essential products, and a commanding market position in an industry with high barriers to entry. The global market for radiotherapy devices is set to expand significantly over the next several years as cancer diagnoses become more prevalent in international markets, and the growing applicability of radiotherapy and economic appeal should help it find additional niches. With Varian's leading market share and consistent operating efficiency, consistent economic profits for the next several years seem well within reach.Operating Results:Consolidated revenues were up 3.7% with an 11% improvement in gross orders, and an 80 basis point gain in consolidated gross margin. Operating margins took a bit of a hit in the quarter as SG&A margin crept up by about 360 basis points year-to-year, largely due to a restructuring charge related to headcount reduction, though foreign exchange effects also played a role. R&D margin, in contrast, decreased mildly by 40 basis points. As a result, net margins came down slightly, though a 270 basis point drop in tax rate from the R&D tax credit extension help ameliorate this a bit.Breaking things down by segment reveals that underlying performance was stronger than it seemed, with macroeconomic headwinds weighing on results. Oncology Systems again led the way, with a 4% improvement in revenues year-to-year, held back by a 400 basis point headwind from forex effects. Consistent with the thesis that international markets are the company's target area for growth, a 12% improvement in Oncology revenues in the EMEA region (18% on a constant currency basis) and a 17% improvement in APAC (23% in constant currency) more than made up for a 2% decline in the Americas (which actually represented an improvement from the performance in the same period 1 year ago, which was a 5% decline). Product approvals for the company's Edge radiosurgery system in China bode well for the company in its efforts to gain access to a burgeoning market with skyrocketing rates of lung cancer. Critical to the notion that Varian can retain its edge by leveraging new technologies and techniques to find new treatment niches, a patient in the UK was successfully treated with the company's RapidPlan IMRT system, which uses data gathered from previously analyzed, standard-of-care cases to help develop treatment protocols for all types of IMRT. While the system isn't intended to completely replace human therapy planners, its potential to extend the understanding of less experienced ones (say, in developing countries) ought to improve the company's reach. And while new research on cancer therapeutics continues to be excruciatingly difficult, new evidence continues to mount that adding radiotherapy to existing salvage therapies can significantly prolong progression-free and overall survival in certain cases.A 34% improvement in Imaging Component revenues was largely due to a weak comparison a year ago, as a multi-million dollar win in Korea helped drive outperformance. The always-lumpy particle therapy business held remarkably steady, though the delayed Maryland proton project remained just that-- delayed-- and revenues related to the project are still held back. Backlog increased significantly by about 13% year-to-year, suggesting that demand remains strong.Turning to the balance sheet, some erosion in NCAV was seen as cash was deployed to help buy back stock though overall the company remains highly liquid, allowing to continue to make bolt-on acquisitions.Assessment and Outlook:With foreign exchange effects expected to weigh upon revenues, Varian lowered its revenue guidance to 5% year-on-year, significantly less than what had previously been anticipated. Nevertheless, the underlying strength of the business remains intact, as constant-currency sales and backlog grew at a pace that had been expected previously, and the sales momentum generated this quarter should allow the company to hit its previous EPS target of $4.16-$4.26, with the benefit of share buybacks. Longer-term, management continues to expect gross margins to expand to the 43-44% range (compared to a 41-42% historical range), and notes that these results didn't even take into account revenues from the (again, highly lumpy) proton therapy business. SGA expenses are expected by the company to come down to the 15% range longer term, which over the course of the rest of this fiscal year would imply a 100-200 BPS improvement in operating margin overall from this quarter. Overall, the fundamentals of the company remain strong, with margins holding steady, and growth coming in a bit stronger than expected, though there's no getting around the fact that the company is party to currency risk.I view my investment thesis as being intact. I'm not really expecting a whole lot of growth out of the Americas, where new installation opportunities are few and far between; Varian will probably have to rely upon upgrades and new services or products like RapidPlan to really drive things. Emerging market sales growth was more in line with my expectations, which was more of a central pillar to my investment thesis. Foreign exchange headwinds will probably not last forever, but the trends that favor increased utilization of Varian's products-- rising rates of cancer, increased expenditures on healthcare in emerging economies, and new applications for radiotherapy-- appear durable. The production of radiotherapy devices remains one with high intellectual barriers to entry, and the market remains highly consolidated. Varian's economic moat-- its large and growing portfolio of products and expertise (intangibles), economic and geographic scale, and barriers to entry remain in place. All in all, I see little reason to adjust my long-term view of the company, though some adjustment should probably be made to short-term expectations in light of expected headwinds from temporary forces beyond the company's control.Valuation:After updating my discounted cash flow model to account for management's guidance and recent results, I am increasing my fair value estimate back up to $93 per share. I forecast intermediate term sales growth to rebound from a likely underperforming year (due to foreign exchange effects), with 5-year growth coming up to 6-7% per year. An increase in capital sales in emerging markets will likely hold back gross margin expansion that might be offered through sales of after-market products in developed markets, and I model operating margins to compress in the intermediate term before expanding later in the forecast period as capital sales slow. I predict long-term operating margins of 18-19%, and continue to use an 8.5% weighted average cost of capital to discount cash flows.My fair value estimate implies a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23 times, and an EV/EBITDA ratio of 16 times. With shares trading right at an EV/EBITDA of 16 after today's jump, I view them as fully valued, without any margin of safety.Conclusion:Though I certainly can't recommend buying into the stock at the moment, I do view Varian as a long-term hold at this price, and am willing to hold onto my shares to see my investment thesis play out fully. I think the long-term outlook priced into the stock at the moment is reasonable, though doesn't leave investors with a lot of margin for error. Long-term trends are still definitely intact, and the industry is a bit more resistant to technological disruption than other ones, barring a huge breakthrough (like, say, finding a cure for cancer that doesn't appear to be in the offing). As happy as I am with today's price movement, I'm disappointed not being able to get more shares of this high quality company at a lower price. I'll be waiting for a discount to kick back in."
4299075,102293,2019-10-25T09:49:29-04:00,"Varian is targeting robust hardware opportunity in radiation therapy space.The company is transforming its product mix towards recurring software and systems sales.Emerging markets have become a major growth driver.The company is focusing on expanding into emerging businesses and technologies.Retail investors, however, should be aware of certain company-specific risks.","The yield curve is no longer inverted. Yet, recessionary fears are far from over. The money market curve has not normalized. Economic indicators are mostly lackluster. All these factors are predicting a difficult economy and dangerous stock markets. In these times, it is best for retail investors to stick with fundamentally strong and reasonably priced stocks.Varian Medical Systems (NYSE:VAR) satisfies these conditions, making it the perfect pick today. I had previously recommended the company in April 2018. Then, I had set the 12-month consensus target price to $130. The stock traded above $130 from January 25 to July 24.However, the stock fell by around 12% after the company reported third-quarter earnings. This decline has presented retail investors a unique opportunity to pick up this company with a favorable risk/reward ratio. However, this may fast change after the company’s robust fourth-quarter earnings.In the fourth quarter, Varian reported revenues of $878.9 million, a YoY rise of 9.64% and ahead of the consensus estimate by $20.43 million. The company’s non-GAAP EPS of $1.21 was in line with the consensus estimate.Here, I will present a few reasons why I consider Varian, the market-leading radiation therapy player, to be a robust pick in October.In its investor meeting, Varian highlighted that the global cancer burden is expected to grow from 13.6 million cases in 2010 to 24.6 million cases in 2030. The company also highlighted the infrastructure and skill-based resources required to tackle the cancer problem. The company is targeting this gap by embedding artificial intelligence in its hardware and software solutions.Varian Medical Systems has the largest linear accelerator installed base in the world. At the end of the fourth quarter, the net installed base comprised of 8,496 units. This was a YoY rise of 5% or 439 units. The number seems highly significant, considering that the global market installed base is just more than 12,000. Installed base expansion is also a key demand driver for the company’s upgrades, software, and services offerings.But there is also significant replacement opportunity in the installed base. In its investor meeting, Varian estimated the installed base replacement opportunity for TrueBeam and Halycon to be close to $8.7 billion. This opportunity will be driven by evolving new standards of care and increasing the adoption of SRS (stereotactic radiosurgery) and SBRT (stereotactic body radiation therapy).The fourth quarter and fiscal 2019 figures seem to reinforce the belief that the company is very much on the right path, especially in the hardware segment. In fiscal 2019, Varian reported hardware sales worth $1.52 billion, a YoY rise of 12%. The company’s fourth-quarter hardware sales were $430.2 million, a YoY rise of 10%.Varian reported a record number of orders and revenues for its TrueBeam LINAC system in 2019. The company manufactured around 3,000 TrueBeam systems and received orders for over 200 systems in the fourth quarter.Halcyon, Varian's newest system for IMRT (image-guided volumetric intensity-modulated radiotherapy), has witnessed a 30% YoY rise in orders. In the fourth quarter, there were 114 orders of Halycon placed across the world. The total Halcyon orders received since its launch in May 2017 has reached 398, while the global installed base is 116 systems.In September 2019, Varian unveiled Ethos therapy, the world’s first artificial intelligence-powered adaptive therapy system. This offers on-couch adaptive radiation therapy treatments through the use of artificial intelligence and multi-modality imaging in a standard 15-minute treatment time slot. The company has become a pioneer in the personalized adaptive radiation therapy area. Varian has already received 17 orders for Ethos, including 11 new systems and six conversions in Europe and Australia. Currently, Ethos is CE Mark registered and 510K pending.Varian also reported a 40% YoY rise in orders for brachytherapy afterloaders, which reached 112 in fiscal 2019. The company’s global brachytherapy installed base is now 1,161 systems.Varian Medical Systems’ revenue mix is gradually shifting towards the recurring software and services businesses. In 2005, the company earned almost 19% of its revenues from services, while 81% came from hardware and software license sales. Fast forward to 2019, and we see a healthy 53% revenue coming from recurring-type services and emerging businesses and technologies. These businesses are faster growing and also generate higher margins. This trend will further reduce revenue variability and thereby risk profile of the company.In its investor meeting, Varian claimed that it is targeting $3 billion software portfolio opportunity. The company’s software portfolio includes Eclipse Treatment planning software, Velocity Image Management software, Aria Oncology EMR, and 360 Oncology Care Coordination software. Besides, the recurrence of brain metastases is fueling demand for HyperArc software. Finally, the company is focusing on reducing the learning curve of technologists and improving quality through RapidPlan and Eclipse MCO (Multi-Criteria Optimization).In fiscal 2019, Varian reported software revenues worth $577 million, a YoY rise of 16%. Service revenues were $1.12 billion, a YoY rise of 6%. Besides organic growth, the company’s targeted acquisitions have also helped boost its services revenues. The acquisition of CTSI (Cancer Treatment Services International), completed in 2019, is playing a pivotal role in enabling the company to further meet the unmet needs of physicians and patients. The company’s partnership with Oncora Medical will further accelerate the development of software tools to enable precision medicine in radiation oncology space.Varian seems to have received some respite from tariffs that are wreaking havoc for the entire medical device industry. In the fourth quarter, the company secured tariff exclusions both from United States Trade Representative for components sourced from China and from China for tariffs imposed on medical linear accelerators.In fiscal 2019, Varian’s ex-Americas revenues grew at a much faster pace. The company reported $1.07 billion in revenues from the EMEA market, a YoY rise of 14%. APAC revenues were $624.3 million, a YoY rise of 16%. Increasing incidence of cancer, pent-up demand, underpenetration, and the company’s brand positioning has made these markets a lucrative opportunity for Varian.Varian Medical Systems reported robust performance in key growth markets of India and China. In India, Varian secured orders for 13 TrueBeam systems as a part of the Tata Trusts Framework Agreement.In China, the company reported an increasing demand for software and hardware licenses. Varian expects this momentum to continue in fiscal 2020. The company continues to be a market leader in the radiation therapy segment in China.To further penetrate the Chinese market, Varian localized the Aria Oncology EMR. Thereafter, in the fourth quarter, the company secured the first big software tender in China at Tianjin Tumor Hospital that includes the ARIA China Clinical Information platform.Sales in Japan remained low. However, this impact was offset by growth in China, Southeast Asia, and Korea.Going beyond radiation oncology, Varian is now trying to penetrate in the interventional oncology space. The company estimates this market to be worth $860 million in 2019 and expects it to grow to $1.1 billion in 2022. To leverage this opportunity, Varian has acquired Endocare, Alicon, and Boston Scientific’s (NYSE:BSX) microspheres portfolio.In June, Varian acquired Endocare, hardware, and software make for cryoablation and microwave ablation. The company also acquired an embolic therapy company, Alicon, focused on treating liver cancer in China.In July, Varian signed an agreement to purchase Boston Scientific’s portfolio of microsphere and bland embolic bead products for treating arteriovenous malformations and hypervascular tumors. The deal was concluded for a consideration of $90 million.Varian is also targeting markets beyond oncology. In May 2019, the company acquired a privately-held company, CyberHeart. This deal brought in intellectual property required for cardiac radio ablation or the use of radiation in the heart as well as for other forms of radiosurgery for cardiovascular disease.While there are several pros to this company, there are also a few cons. The biggest challenge for Varian is ensuring breakeven for its Proton Solutions business. The business reported sales of $143.9 million in fiscal 2019, a YoY decline of 3%. While the proton solutions business has not turned lucrative, this may possibly change after the launch of next-generation FLASH therapy.In April 2019, the company reported first pre-clinical results for FLASH therapy, which is a non-invasive therapy involving delivering high doses of radiation in ultra-high-speeds to tumors. The results were encouraging and demonstrated 25-30 percent less damage to lung tissue, resulting in less fibrosis of the lung, and an average of 35 percent reduction in skin dermatitis during treatment as compared to conventional proton therapy.It should be remembered that FLASH therapy is currently in the early development stage. Hence, Varian will need to invest significant amounts to bring it to the commercialization stage.On July 10, CMS announced a proposal for a mandatory bundled payment model for radiation oncology companies. The aim of this proposal is to reduce Medicare spending by $260 million over a five-year period. According to this site-neutral, episodic alternative payment model for radiotherapy, CMS will pay radiotherapy providers and suppliers for radiotherapy treatments during a 90-day care period. CMS will pay after assessing the providers on measures of quality and patient experience. CMS will also adjust payment based on national base rates, trend factors, adjustments for each participant’s case mix, historical experience, and geographic location. In this demonstration pilot, CMS plans to include 40% of radiation oncology episodes. The final ruling is anticipated in November. Varian claims to be prepared for a shift to value-based payments. However, dramatic changes in the reimbursement model may affect the company’s financial performance at least in the short-term future.Additionally, lumpy orders such as those in Japan can increase top-line variability for Varian.Varian Medical Systems is currently trading at a PE of 34.27x and a forward PE of 24.17x. Wall Street analysts have estimated the 12-month consensus target price for the company to be $139.06.However, after the company’s robust fourth-quarter earnings performance, Barrington analyst Michael Petusky has raised the company’s target price from $146 to $152. The analyst has based these revisions on the strong revenue and earnings performance of the company. Besides, unlike the third quarter, the company’s oncology order momentum is also back on track.I believe that Michael Petusky’s target price is reflective of the true potential of this stock. This implies a growth potential of 20.3% based on the closing price on October 24. Hence, I recommend retail investors to go for this average risk stock in October 2019."
3400805,69565,2015-08-06T09:07:43-04:00,"Shares of Varian Medical Systems have recently come back to where they started the year with disappointing second-quarter results.Varian is fundamentally sound with a well-defined growth runway supported by the growing worldwide fight against cancer.Despite those positive attributes, Varian’s current valuation suggests there is limited upside from current prices.","Shares of Varian Medical Systems (NYSE: VAR) got off to a strong start in 2015, trading as high as $96.50 after starting the year around $86.50, thanks to an impressive first-quarter earnings report that came in late January. In late April, Varian gave all that ground up when second-quarter results came in below expectations and the company lowered its full-year outlook for EPS citing ""adverse currency values.""With shares back to where they started the year, it may be worth considering if current prices offer an attractive entry point for investors.Fundamental QualityVarian is the world's leading manufacturer of medical devices and software for treating cancer and other medical conditions that require various types of therapies. Varian has been incorporated since 1948 and the long-standing nature of the company certainly shines through to the company's superior operational efficiency metrics. Both the company's TTM operating margin of 18.71% and TTM return on equity of 25.07% outpace the medical devices industry averages. The company also generates $0.43 more in revenue for every dollar in assets than the average company operating in the space.Varian's balance sheet is also extremely strong, with more than $932 million in combined cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments compared to only $512.5 million in total debt. Overall, the balance sheet has a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.29 and a current ratio of 2.06, both of which indicate exceptional financial strength.GrowthLooking to the past, Varian has done a tremendous job, consistently growing both its top and bottom lines.VAR Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsMoving forward, analysts expect this growth to continue, although at a much more subdued rate with only 1.8% and 3.9% revenue growth anticipated for 2015 and 2016, respectively. On the bottom line, EPS is forecasted to go from $3.83 in 2014 to $4.37 this year and $4.63 in 2016.The growth of tomorrow is expected to continue to be fueled by the global tailwinds that have helped Varian in growing its business up to this point. The global fight against cancer is only going to get bigger as we move forward, with 27 million new cancer cases and 17.5 million cancer deaths per year expected by the year 2050 according to the American Cancer Society. Those figures are in comparison to only 12 million new cancer cases and 7.6 million cancer deaths in 2007.Especially in the United States, the segment of the population most likely to develop cancer, those 60 or older, is expected to grow rapidly, with statistics from the U.S. Census Bureau estimating this segment will grow over 80% in population from 2010 to 2030.Outside of the United States, the rest of the world is still rather early in its fight against cancer, as the map from the company's presentation at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference shows.Back here in the United States, there is still huge upside potential as Varian anticipates a massive surge of upgrading old technology, translating into what the company sees as a $440 million incremental revenue opportunity over the next 5 years.Varian management is also very excited about the company's proton technology, which MEDryaintell estimates could be monetized and generate $2.5 billion in revenue by 2030, if executed properly.With Varian having invested $235.6 million in research & development over the past year, I am confident in the company's ability to continually improve and meet current growth expectations.ValuationBased on the above valuation profile, Varian trades at a sizeable discount to its industry peers. Much of this discount is well-deserved based on the company's sluggish pace of anticipated growth. In fact, in a historical context, the current valuation Varian trades at is slightly above the historical norm, with the company's 5-year median price-to-earnings ratio coming in at 20.21.Therefore, I see limited potential for the company to undergo any period of multiple expansion, and only see shares justified in trading as high as $92 (2015 EPS estimate * 21 P/E ratio) within the next year.The TakeawayShares of Varian got off to a strong start to 2015 but now trade at the same levels they started the year at. Fundamentally, the company is as strong as they come, while long term, the company has a well-defined growth runway supported by strong tailwinds. Valuation-wise, however, nothing suggests with conviction that current prices are an attractive entry point, although it is entirely possible shares could rally off these levels."
2866766,25120,2015-01-30T20:34:48-05:00,"Varian Medical reports solid results and maintains its outlook, despite severe currency headwinds.This just shows that the business is performing very well on an operational basis.The company operates well in long-term growing markets, which, combined with a relatively contained valuation, offers appeal.Promising proton therapy developments can only provide long-term icing on the cake.","Varian Medical (NYSE:VAR) reported very solid second-quarter results and maintained its full-year outlook, despite severe currency headwinds. This just shows that the underlying performance of the business is very strong.Following solid growth in the past, Varian remains well positioned to outperform in the future amidst a relatively fair valuation multiple. The promising proton therapy developments can only act as icing on the cake in the future, a reason why I am quite upbeat on the shares. This makes me a buyer, although I would not chase today's momentum, but wait for a potential pullback in the days or weeks ahead to initiate a position.The BusinessVarian Medical Systems is a technology-based healthcare business which operates under three major business units. The company operates an oncology business, an imaging components business and particle therapy treatment.Unfortunately for humans, oncology is a huge market, and it is the largest segment for Varian as well. According to the WHO and other agencies, there are currently some 17.5 million people dying of cancer each year, while the number of new patients will top 27 million per year by 2050. To treat patients, Varian sells the Varian accelerator, among others, which provides radiotherapy to treat cancer. To-date, the company has sold some 7,500 of these machines across the globe, being able to treat 2.8 million patients each year. Despite this large number, the penetration numbers are still relatively low.This product, oncology services and aging populations all drive the long-term growth prospects for Varian in the oncology segment. It sees the market growing by 5%-7% per year amidst the aging of the population, upgrade and the replacement of legacy systems.In terms of the imaging business, Varian is active in terms of X-Ray tubes and digital flat panels. These products are built as sub-components for equipment manufacturers, as well as distributors. While these X-Ray tubes can be used in medical devices, they can also be used for security and industrial applications. The innovation in this segment, relations with OEMs and new software should drive sales growth by 7%-9% in the long run, according to the company's predictions.Coming to the third business of Varian, which is the particle therapy, the company has 10 large proton projects in the backlog. Proton therapy is essentially an improved therapy compared to X-Ray radiation in the treatment for cancer, for example. The main benefit results from the better focus on tackling cancers, thereby avoiding damage to healthy cells.As a consequence, the patient can handle higher doses of radiation, thereby making the cancer treatment more effective. This segment is still small, given the relative experimental stage of the business, although the projections for the future look bright. Besides better treatment, proton could lower the overall costs of healthcare as well, creating a true win-win situation.All in all, Varian anticipates to continue to grow the overall business at a 6%-8% growth rate. Gross margins are seen largely stable, as the incremental profit contribution from proton and operating leverage should allow for operating earnings growth of 8%-10%.Solid Start To The YearVarian reported first-quarter revenues of $737.9 million, a modest 3.7% increase compared to the year before. Reported revenues beat consensus estimates by some $20 million. The solid revenue numbers come as a surprise, given that Varian generates half of its revenues abroad.The company managed to boost gross margins by 80 basis points to a fat 44.3% of sales. While the company managed to cut R&D expenses, other operating expenses were on the rise. As a result of these cost increases, operating margins dropped by 250 basis points to 17.5% of sales, despite the gross margin gains.The main reason for the surprising operating margin compression was a restructuring charge of $11 million. Adjusting for this restructuring charge, operating margins would still be down by a full percent to 19.0% of sales. Another ""softening"" factor has been $5 million in charges taken following the devaluation of the Venezuelan Bolivar.On the bottom line, Varian posted net earnings of $93.3 million, which is 4.8% less compared to the year before. Thanks to very sizable share repurchases, earnings actually improved by a penny to $0.92 per share. Backing out the restructuring costs, earnings would have come in at $0.99 per share, which is twelve cents better than anticipated.Orders And Business PerformanceVarian reported an order intake of $725.8 million for the quarter, translating into a book-to-bill ratio of 0.98 times, indicating that the company is eating into its backlog. Yet, I would not be too worried about that shortfall, as the first quarter is typically slow in terms of orders. In the comparable period last year, this ratio came in at just 0.92 times. Furthermore, the backlog has risen by nearly 13% over the past year to $3.12 billion.The main oncology systems segment still makes up the vast majority of sales. Revenues were up by 5.3% to $561.7 million, now making up more than 77% of total sales. The segment benefited from solid growth both at home as well as abroad.Sales of imaging products were up by 3.0% to $166.0 million, driven by the imaging components business. ""Other"" revenues, which include the promising particle therapy, came in at just $8.6 million, which is actually down from $8.9 million in the comparable period last year.Premium Valuation, Strong Balance SheetVarian ended the quarter with a very strong bank account. Cash holdings improved to $973 million, and thereby approached the billion mark. Combined with debt holdings of $525 million, the company has a net cash load of $450 million - which, arguably, is very comforting.With 102 million shares outstanding, currently trading at $93 per share, the equity of the medical device manufacturer is valued at nearly $9.5 billion. Subtracting net cash holdings, the operating assets of the business are valued at $9.0 billion, still a huge amount.On a trailing basis, revenues are close to reaching $3.1 billion, with EBITDA seen around $640 million, as earnings have come in at $400 million. This values the business at 2.9 times sales, 14 times EBITDA and roughly 22-23 times earnings.Capturing Long-Term GrowthVarian has ambitious targets which call for sustainable high-single digit sales growth. This comes on the back of the saddening long-term trends that cancer is continuing to claim more lives. Over the past decade, the company has more than doubled its sales from $1.4 billion in 2005 to nearly $3.1 billion by now. This translates into average growth of around 8%, the same growth rate as the company targets for the future.This steady growth and very high, and the stable margins are quite appealing. Rather than making many large acquisitions or spending the cash on dividends, the company is returning cash to its investors through share repurchases. Over the past decade alone, Varian has bought back one in every four shares outstanding. The combination of sales growth and share repurchases have resulted in revenues being up threefold over the past decade.Continued Bright Days AheadBetween 2004 and 2010, Varian has seen its shares trade at a $30-$60 range before steadily rising to fresh highs at $93 per share. Shares have gradually moved up in recent years as the company continued to grow the business and reduce the share float, thereby delivering on solid earnings per share growth.In essence, Varian aims to do the same trick again by 2025. If the company can double its sales over the coming decade and continues to steadily repurchase shares, earnings per share could triple yet again by 2025. This follows the good prospects for the industry going forward. Based on this simple metric, earnings of $12 per share by 2015 would be among the possibilities. This could easily allow for a valuation of $200-$300 per share at the time.The real potential added bonus comes from proton therapy, which yet has to make a real contribution and could become the positive outlier for the business. It is hard to estimate how much this relatively new therapy could add to Varian's operations, as the market is still very small and in a nascent stage.For the shorter term, Varian's CEO Dow Wilson sees earnings of $4.16-$4.26 per share, despite the currency headwinds, based on anticipated sales growth of some 5%. As a matter of fact, this is not a new guidance, but instead, a reiteration of the previous one, despite $0.20 per share anticipated headwinds from a strong dollar. It is not just the strong dollar which creates headwinds. Varian has to incur costs in terms of Swiss francs as well.Based on the full-year guidance, this creates a more appealing multiple at 21 times forward earnings, a roughly 20% premium to the overall market. The strong balance sheet and long-term rosy trends probably justify this valuation premium. Mr. Wilson continues to stress the potential of the proton projects in the conference call, although the projects are still not booked. This leaves real potential upside to earnings or profits, if and when the projects are recognized.So, in essence, Varian is a steadily growing and profitable business with very appealing long-term prospects. On top of that comes the very strong balance sheet, while the potential success of proton only acts as a long-term potential icing on the cake. Following the very strong momentum on the back of the results, I would wait for the price to stabilize and buy steadily into this great operator on dips."
3880166,24361,2016-02-10T15:43:50-05:00,"Varian has no serious challenger to its 60%-plus share of the radiotherapy equipment market, but currency and reimbursement pressures are proving to be more troubling factors.Proton beam therapy could offer some upside down the line, but VAR will probably need to content itself with revenue growth in the mid-single digits.The company can support a fair value of $78.50 on close to 7% long-term FCF growth, but investors are very concerned that weak order growth will persist.","While being successful enough to dominate your market is normally a good thing, it does create some valid questions about how Varian (NYSE:VAR) will continue to generate impressive FCF growth when it already has about 60% share of a market that is expected to grow less than 5% a year in the future. Faster-growing emerging markets like China can help, as can the growth of emerging product categories like proton beam therapy, but strong market share, good margins, and reimbursement pressure do create some concerns.Varian's shares look slightly undervalued to me today and that's not a common experience in the many years I've followed the stock. While I own the much riskier and more undervalued Accuray (NASDAQ:ARAY), I'm not quite as keen on Varian as I don't think the 5% to 10% upside is sufficient reward for the risks of a further slowing of the radiotherapy market and a Wall Street overreaction to that slowdown.The 800lb GorillaVarian is pretty much the name in radiotherapy, as the company has around 60% global market share for radiation oncology systems and closer to 70% share in the U.S. The company didn't establish its leadership position by accident. It consistently outscores Elekta (OTCPK:EKTAY) and Accuray (and, before it quits the market, Siemens (OTC:SMQFY)) in surveys/polls on versatility, reliability, throughput, training, innovation ... and pretty much anything else you'd think of other than price. While Elekta has its defenders and has some positive attributes in imaging and software, and Accuray has been trying to build its business on the back of imaging, motion tracking and accuracy, Varian has largely left its competitors to compete on price (Elekta) or niche applications (Accuray).Varian's business is still fairly U.S.-centric (close to 50% of revenue), but China is of growing importance as the major emerging markets like China and Brazil offer better long-term growth than the overall 3% to 5% that is likely in radiotherapy equipment and software.VAR sells multiple systems, but the TrueBeam is the workhorse platform and makes up 70% of the company's global linac orders (and 90% of U.S. orders). Oncology makes up more than three-quarters of Varian's revenue, with a roughly 60%/40% split between products and licensing/service. Software makes up about 20% of oncology revenue, but it is split among both products and service. Varian also has a small brachytherapy business within its oncology business.In addition to oncology, Varian is a player in imaging components like X-ray tubes, linacs, and flat panel detectors. While there are non-medical applications for these products (including industrial inspection and security), a lot of this business is build around supplying other med-techs like Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY), Hologic (NASDAQ:HOLX), General Electric (NYSE:GE) and Philips (NYSE:PHG) for their imaging businesses.What Drives Growth?Most projections for the growth of the global radiotherapy market fall in around 3% to 5% per year for the long term, with more growth expected in the emerging markets like China that have significantly lower numbers of linacs per capita than the U.S.Growth in the U.S. is harder to come by, due to both consolidation among healthcare providers (which has led to fewer marginal/under-utilized vaults) and reimbursement. Although the most recent changes in reimbursement from the CMS were less severe than feared (down 1% to 2% for 2016), there has been ongoing pressure, and particularly in the simpler cases that make up the bulk of most centers' patient flow. What's more, there have been steps toward more bundled reimbursement in oncology, which would have the effect of shifting compensation away from a per-treatment basis. All told, it's not a good thing for Varian.So what can VAR do to drive more growth? Competitive share gains are still possible, and it does look as though Varian (and Accuray) have benefited from Elekta's operational problems in recent years. Varian can also improve its growth somewhat by producing better software - it has started to cut into the market-leading share of Elekta's Mosaic software with its own Aria platform, and VAR is also looking to drive incremental growth from its treatment planning software platforms.There's also may be a chance that immuno-oncology helps radiation. It is by no means proven or commonly accepted at this point, but there is some evidence that radiation and immuno-oncology agents like CTLA-4 and PD-1 antibodies can work synergistically (meaning they are more effective when combined). Given that PD-1 has established itself as the next Very Big Deal in oncology, this could possibly offer some support to patient volumes.A different way of delivering therapy also holds some hope of improving the growth outlook as more centers adopt proton beam therapy (or PBT). Relative to X-rays, protons delivery energy to tissue in a more focused way, and by changing the energy of the proton the rad-onc can directly target the tumor while delivering much less radiation to healthy tissue. This chart from Mevion highlights the basic principle:While PBT has a real advantage in dose-targeting, the systems are large and extremely expensive. An oncology center can buy a basic linac for around $2.5 million, but Varian's ""bargain"" alternative (the ProBeam Compact) is still $25 million and quite huge.What's more, it's not entirely clear that the dose-targeting advantages of PBT translate into meaningful clinical benefit. I've seen several clinical trials that show non-inferiority of PBT to standard radiation therapy, but I haven't seen superior results outside of a few studies in pediatric oncology and some ocular indications. Given that, trying reimbursement backdrop, it could be harder to really leverage the PBT opportunity in the near term, and PBT is only around 5% of Varian's oncology business today (though growing much faster than the legacy business). In terms of the larger market, Varian has about 20% share of the PBA placements (IBA (IBAB.BR) (OTCPK:IOBCF) is the leader at 40%).Technology never stands still, and that will likely require Varian to continue spending meaningful sums on R&D. While PBT is barely established now, there is already talk of carbon ion beam therapy, with most of the research being led by the Japanese. It is very early, but so far, the prices talked about for carbon ion beam therapy make PBT sound like a bargain. All of that said, Varian has positioned itself as something of a ""fast follower"", so it won't surprise me if Varian commits resources to carbon ion beam and/or MRI-linac if and when they look like potentially significant future platforms.Navigating Slower WatersVarian didn't have a bad fiscal first quarter, as constant-currency oncology revenue growth of 9% was a little better than expected and margins were consistent with expectations. Orders weren't so encouraging, though, as oncology orders declined 1% in constant currency and trailing 12-month orders are only up about 4% in constant currency.Looking ahead, there are reasons to be concerned that Elekta will continue to use aggressive pricing to win business, but I believe that weaker results in Elekta's higher-margin Gamma Knife business and investor dissatisfaction with weak margins will limit that to some extent. The bigger risk is more likely that reimbursement changes continue to squeeze Varian's core market and that a strong dollar gives Elekta a pricing edge.I'm comfortable with a long-term annualized revenue growth target of over 4% for VAR. That's above the underlying growth rate I expect from the linac market, but then I expect Varian to benefit from the growth in the PBT market (some, but not all, of which will come at the expense of linacs) - something that will not benefit Elekta and Accuray based on their present capabilities. I'm not looking for major margin upside from this point, but a half-point improvement in long-term FCF margin combined with the revenue growth rate is good for close to 7% FCF growth. That, in turn, supports a fair value of $78.50 today.The Bottom LineVarian's shares are close to a 52-week low and trading at multiples that haven't been very common throughout most of its recent trading history. That said, this is a very skittish market, and there are a lot of worries that Varian is going to find it quite challenging to produce meaningful revenue growth in the coming years. Against that backdrop, I'd probably want a better margin of error before committing to a meaningful position.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3915926,87586,2016-02-22T10:25:25-05:00,"Varian Medical holds a leading position in the cancer treatment space and is active in the cancer treatment value chain.Varian beat market expectations in first quarter 2016 results, but gross orders weaker.Valuations on an earnings and cash flow basis are not excessive at this point.Varian's net cash position gives them the firepower to tide through this uncertainty.I have accumulated shares of VAR last week.","Introduction:Varian Medical (NYSE:VAR) is the market leader within the cancer treatment space, which is among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide with more than 8 million cancer related deaths worldwide every year according to data from the World Health Organization. Despite being in a leading position for cancer treatment and being actively involved in the value chain of cancer treatment, VAR has traded flat since their first quarter 2016 results announcement that saw them beat both top- and bottom- line. The concern in my view is the soft gross orders from overseas markets especially in key markets like Japan and China. Nonetheless, I note that the concern with softness from international markets is not something new, and VAR has already corrected more than 15% since last year, despite the softness in orders, results on a constant currency basis outweigh that of the temporary weakness in overseas orders. Accordingly, I see the latest sell down as manifestly excessive, and have accumulated positions in VAR last week.AboutVAR has three reportable segments, 1) the oncology services, which accounted for more than three quarters of their revenue (76%), 2) the imaging segment, which account for the next 20% and 3) particle therapy takes the rest in the latest financial year. The revenue mix has been relatively stable over the last three years.First quarter results beat expectations but international orders disappointVAR reported first quarter results that beat the street's estimates for top- and bottom- line. Their oncology department grew 9% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by their international business, which grew by 31% on a constant currency basis.Despite the strong results, concerns about their softer than expected international orders from key markets like Japan and China saw VAR trading down after the results announcement. In my view, the recent sell down in the shares of VAR is a little excessive especially when we consider that gross orders is just down 1% on a constant currency basis.Customers of VarianAccording to their annual report 2015, VAR's main customers include university research and community hospitals, private and governmental institutions, healthcare agencies, physicians' offices, oncology practices, radiotherapy centers and cancer care clinics.I think the customer base gives investors like me reasonable comfort as this act as a form of barriers for new entrants. This is because healthcare agencies above are not likely to simply switch to another competitor without them first undergoing strict tests and suitability.Key Operating Metrics: ValuationsI used the earnings and cash flow price multiple to value VAR based on their closing price on the 19th of February. At 18.5x, and 20.8x, they are trading at a not insignificant discount to their medical equipment peers in the market. As mentioned above, I think the discount to their peers is the result of the street's fears of a general slow down in international sales that affected VAR.Source: BloombergWith that said however, the sell-down is overly excessive in my view in the near-term as the current slow down in international sales is in-line with general economic softness in Japan and China.Risk considerationsThe negative interest rates adopted by the Bank of Japan last month highlighted how far Japan is to an economic recovery in my view. A persistent slow down in Japan could see VAR's international revenue, which accounts for about 55% of total revenues in 2015 remain soft.Strong Balance Sheet smoothens the rideDespite the near- and mid- term volatility, VAR's strong net cash position should offer investors some comfort to tide through the current volatility. Referring to the diagram below, I calculated VAR's Net Cash position, you can see the formula for yourself below.Source: Company dataThe data above illustrates VAR's balance sheet as at the latest quarter. I then took the total net cash of VAR (after removing debt) and divided this by their total diluted shares outstanding to get a diluted net cash per share of $2.30. This strong financial position puts them in a good position to ride out the current economic volatility.ConclusionAccording to statistics by the Centers for Disease and Control, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States. This means that one out of every four deaths is the direct result of cancer. An ageing population in the U.S, European Union and in the Asia Pacific countries will continue to see demand remain resilient in the mid- to long- term for high quality medical equipment products. VAR's exciting pipeline of innovative products in the oncology space could cement their position in the oncology field. I think the recent price correction presents an excellent opportunity to accumulate shares of VAR."

This sounds like a diverse offering but it all hinges on its expertise with X-ray, radiation and imaging technology.The business, incorporated in 1948, has two main operating divisions: Oncology Systems, and Imaging Components. A breakdown of sales and reportable segment operating profit: Oncology systems 76% and 75%; Imaging Components nearly 22% and 25%.The balance of sales is ""Other"" including Varian Proton Therapies (VPT) and GTC (technology development division), which are net loss making.Within the larger Oncology Systems, VAR breaks down segment revenues into around 60% product sales and 40% services. This high level of services revenue is valuable and makes the offering ""sticky."" Once a system is installed, VAR maintains a long-standing relationship through the services business (these could include maintenance, training, technical and operational support). Across all business lines, product revenues were 68% and services 32% in 2014.The geographic split of overall sales is 41% U.S., 59% international. By segment, for Oncology Systems, the geographic split of sales into North America, EMEA, Asia and Rest of World was 47%, 29%, 18% and 6%, respectively, in 2014. The split for Imaging Systems for North America, EMEA, Asia and Rest of World was 29%, 29%, 41% and 1%, respectively, in 2014.R&D expense is around 7-8% of total revenues, consistent with such medical device businesses.5-year chartFinancials (from filings, Gurufocus):*Preliminary results for Sep 2015Revenue and Earnings GrowthVAR is a well-established player in the radiotherapy field. Revenue growth has been around 9.5% CAGR over the last 10 years, and 6.6% over the last 5 years. Earnings growth has been 12.5% CAGR over 10 years, and 8.5% over 5 years.For Oncology Systems, growth is driven by the underlying trend in increasing cases of cancer amongst an aging population. Radiotherapy is established as a core modality of treatment for many cancers, and around two-thirds of all cancer patients will receive radiotherapy as part of their treatment (Source: American Society for Radiation Oncology, ASTRO). As new technologies develop allowing more focused treatment, and clinical experience with them increases, radiotherapy will continue to grow in usefulness in treating cancer.In 2012, across the world, there were 14.1 million new cases of cancer, 8.2 million deaths due to cancer, and 32.6 million people living with cancer (within 5 years of diagnosis) (Source: International Agency for Research on Cancer).This is predicted to grow to over 19 million new cases, and 11 million deaths per year by 2025. (These data are from a prediction tool on the IARC website; while actual numbers are likely to vary, and radiotherapy is not appropriate for all cancers, the trend is strongly upwards).Radiotherapy, most commonly delivered via external beam radiation, involves the use of linear accelerators (LINAC) to deliver treatment. To date, VAR has an installed base of over 6500 LINACs around the world. VAR also supplies internal beam radiotherapy (brachytherapy) and particle therapy (proton beam therapy).VAR is an early provider of Proton Beam Therapy (PBT) treatment facilities for cancer treatment, through its ""Other"" segment, including Varian Particle Therapy (VPT). PBT involves using more focused delivery of energy to cancer sites (utilizing protons, positively charged particles), rather than x-rays (or photon radiation) that is standard in other radiotherapy.While the effectiveness of treating cancers is similar, the main benefit of PBT is less overspill of energy typically seen in x-ray technology, and hence less collateral damage to surrounding tissues. Although the underlying technology has been around for several decades, this has only recently started to become more widely available.However, it is still only available in limited centers: facilities historically have cost over $150M to build and install, occupy large spaces and are significant infrastructure projects in themselves. Many patients requiring treatment have to travel long distances, including overseas.This has three implications:There is also significant growth opportunity for Oncology systems in developing markets. By 2020, predictions suggest over 9,000 additional radiotherapy treatment machines will be needed in low and middle income countries. This includes estimates for China, India and Brazil of over 3,800, 1,200 and 400 machines respectively.VAR treatment systems are interoperable and flexible allowing communication between products. Treatment of cancers routinely involves multiple medical specialties. These can include radiation oncology, neurosurgery, radiographic imaging and medical oncology. VAR's Oncology Systems allow such multi-disciplinary teams (MDT) to share equipment, resources and information. Good MDT communication typically leads to better patient outcomes.In addition, VAR offers software systems to support core offerings. These assist oncologists and treatment centers with treatment planning and information management including electronic medical records, and aggregating treatment and imaging data from diverse systems. These help to integrate VAR systems into healthcare systems and the daily practices of oncologists, leading to more user and customer loyalty.Within Imaging Components division, markets served include healthcare (diagnostic applications), industrial and screening and inspection at ports. These applications should also see increased demand over time with aging populations, and with increasing attention to international security and protecting ports and borders.The balance sheet is strong with $350M of net cash and equivalents, and debt:equity of 0.29. Return on equity (ROE) has been consistently high over the last 10 years, ranging from 24% to 32%.Buy PriceWhen evaluating a buy price I project out revenues and earnings to 3 years, based on trends, and see if it could reasonably achieve a CAGR of 15%. Why? 3 years as it's not too far out and long-enough for value to out, and 15% as it's a fairly modest performance hurdle which doesn't require optimistic scenarios to play out.When using trends, of course, everything can change and trends reverse. But over a period of time, businesses with long history of growing revenues and earnings, with high ROE, are a good hunting ground. The interesting part is in evaluating if the trend can continue near-term (hence 3 years).CAGR was 6.6% over 5 years, and 9.5% over 10 years. Net margin has varied within a fairly narrow margin between 13.2% and 15.3%. Fully diluted shares outstanding at present are 99.8 million. Annual share repurchase rate over the last 10 years has been over 3%. For buy price calculations, I have used 6% revenue CAGR, 14% net margin and 2% share repurchase rate.Valuation using P/E multipleVAR's PE ratio over the last 10 years varies from 15.5x to 29x, with a 10 year average of 21x. Within the medical devices sector, for companies with a market capitalization of greater than $1 billion, P/E ratios vary from 14x - 60x (excluding high end outliers). This puts VAR's current P/E ratio in the bottom 15% of its industry peers. For valuation purposes, I have used a P/E ratio of 20x (still in the bottom 15%).Using the above figures, a fair value price per share in 3 years for VAR is $109. If our hurdle for compounded return is 15%, this gives a current buy price of $72. Bear in mind, the buy price is calculated using modest assumptions and is not an exact figure. It's a guide around which I'm comfortable to buy.Does reverse DCF support the P/E based valuation?As a sanity check, I also do a reverse discounted cash flow (reverse DCF) calculation to check the valuation is in the right ball-park. When performing a normal DCF, you need reasonable certainty around assumptions and projections for ten years out or more. This is next to impossible to do in healthcare technology sectors including medical devices.However, a reverse DCF can be useful since you are looking for a range of assumptions which need to come good in order for the valuation to hold. In effect, they help to answer the question: ""does this seem reasonable?""Using a two-step reverse DCF, with 7% free cash flow growth rate over 5 years, falling to 5% in years 6-10, then 3% terminal growth rate, and a 10% discount rate gives an intrinsic valuation of $81 per share. This is well within the realms of possible for VAR. A higher discount rate, or lower growth rate could reduce the intrinsic value to low $60s, so my buy price above of $72 is within range and looks reasonable.Risks And OpportunitiesLooking at the historical data is useful to provide track-record of performance. But when assessing if such trends can continue into the near term, we have to think about what could go wrong to prevent such growth. Of course, we can never reliably predict what will happen, but awareness of risks is a useful sanity check.In addition to risks inherent with any medical device company operating internationally, the following risks for VAR are particularly worth pointing out:Proton therapy growth and next generation technologyAs described earlier one of the key benefits of proton therapy is that treatment beams can be much more finely tuned and focused with protons compared to conventional x-ray radiation (even allowing for newer x-ray technologies such as intensity modulated radiotherapy - IMRT, and image guided radiotherapy - IGRT).This ability to deliver a sharper beam of energy, with less energy overspill and collateral damage to surrounding tissues, has generated much interest in cancer treatment - including in the general public.In particular, proton therapy can be valuable for treating highly sensitive tissues, such as certain eye, skull base, paraspinal, and unresectable sarcomas (e.g. bone and muscle tumors). Also, proton therapy's increased accuracy is valuable to prevent side effects from overspill into normal tissue, such as certain brain tumors in children and prostate cancer. (The energy delivered with proton therapy shows a sudden drop off in energy after penetrating the target treatment site, versus photons which have an entry and exit beam).Independent reports suggest the market for proton therapy is projected to reach $2.5 billion by 2030, with Varian having a 14% market share. This approximates to $350 million in sales. While it's a material amount, this is less than 10% of Varian's current sales, and likely less than 5% by 2030 (a 50% change in Varian's market share, up or down, leads to approximately a 5% change in overall sales).The main competitors are IBA (the market leader), Hitachi and Mevion. Varian is the only supplier with a long history of providing radiotherapy systems for cancer treatment.First-generation equipment typically involved a facility the size of street block, and costs of over $150 million. Newer generation facilities, with single, modular treatment rooms are becoming available from all the main providers. These typically have much smaller footprints, are easier to install and are a fraction of the cost (sometimes 80% cheaper), enabling expansion of proton therapy to more regional centers.The proton therapy space is competitive and VAR has a good foothold. But the costs of installation compared to conventional radiotherapy, and applications of proton therapy treatment means there will remain a need for conventional radiotherapy. This is good news for VAR, meaning it can grow both its conventional radiotherapy and proton therapy businesses alongside each other.It's worth bearing in mind, VAR's proton therapy business is a good and developing stream of business, but will have a limited impact on revenues or profits. This is in contrast to the column inches proton therapy gains in the press.Project financingProton therapy centers are costly capital expenditure projects, often totaling over $150 million for multi-treatment large scale facilities. VAR often provides some of the initial financing for these projects for customers and then sells off the debt instruments to other investors. These are accounted for as available-for-sale securities.For example, for the Scripps Proton Therapy Center in San Diego, the total loan commitment to the customer was $165M, of which VAR's loan commitment was up to a maximum of $115M in 2011. As of September 2014, the outstanding loan balance was $75M, of which VAR intends to sell all or a portion before the maturity date in 2017.As VAR continues to build proton therapy centers, and provide some of the initial project financing, there is a risk some of these will become bad debts. They are collateralized against the facilities, and loans are sold off to other investors. But investors should keep an eye on the total loans outstanding.International ExpansionInternational sales currently make up 59% of total sales, so VAR has good experience and track record in operating internationally. However, as noted earlier, much of the expansion opportunity for oncology systems business comes from emerging markets including China, India and Brazil.The upside with these markets is the volume of business that is available. The risk is VAR must remain competitive in a lower profit margin environment for this to benefit the bottom line. Since much of the growth will be from conventional radiotherapy systems, there is likely to be stiff local competition.As a well-established U.S. provider, VAR will certainly have competitive advantage in terms of reputation and time serving the market. But this will not prevent lower priced competitors from trying to gain market share.DisclosureI do not own VAR at the time of writing but may go long if my buy price is reached.This material is provided for informational purposes only, as of the date hereof, and is subject to change without notice.

2538565,63893,2014-10-04T08:45:51-04:00,"Varian Medical Systems is a dominant player in the radiotherapy device market, and the leading producer of linear accelerators used for radiation oncology treatments worldwide.
        The industry at large and Varian in particular stand to benefit from an aging global population and widely expected increased incidence of cancer over the next few decades.
        High barriers to entry, significant switching costs, and hard-to-duplicate intangible assets drive Varian's competitive advantages, and high returns on capital are likely to be sustained for some time.
        I view shares as at worst reasonably valued and more likely undervalued, and am considering this company for my next stock purchase.","Internal medicine physicians and their patients tend to have a grim sense of humor. This is often a function of the demographics of the patient population-- the median age of my patient population is in the 70's-- as well as the comorbidities we tend to see. On a daily basis, I deal with kidney failure, cancer, and heart disease, and it's a rare day when I don't have at least one discussion with a family about end-of-life issues, living wills, and the like. So a line that often comes up from my patients-- usually in jest, sometimes not-- is: ""Well, doc: I guess I gotta die of somethin'."" Then we'll often just laugh, shake our heads at how crappy life can be sometimes, and go on to talk about the hunting trip he's going on or her grandson graduating and how she wants to just make it there. Death is the quiet but disquieting, often unspoken center of medicine: something patients try to stave off and physicians struggle to understand, and this struggle yields a weird brand of gallows humor.The fact of the matter is, though, we are all going to die of something, and what's more, that something is increasingly going to be cancer. The World Health Organization expects the global incidence of cancer to steadily climb from 14 million in 2012 to over 22 million by 2030, driven in a large part by a steadily aging population (there's a downside to living longer) and a trend towards increasing obesity and tobacco use (there's a downside to the export of our Western ways). Global spending on cancer, already estimated to be $1.16 trillion in 2010, is expected to grow even more quickly, particularly as underserved, emerging markets like Asia and Africa gain access to modern-day screening, diagnostics, and treatment modalities. Not to put too fine a point on it (or subject the reader to a bad pun), but cancer is very much a growth industry.Source: Cancer.orgMuch ado is often made of cancer chemotherapeutics, but not quite as attention is paid to the other modalities used to treat cancer, particularly radiation therapy. This may have something to do with the esoteric nature of radiation therapy; even to a physician, radiation oncology is almost a ""black box"" as a field: it's possible to be familiar with the underlying concepts, indications, and adverse effects of the treatments without having any idea at all how the stuff actually works. The intellectual capital required to understand radiation therapy is substantial: one requires an understanding of general medicine and oncology, but also a more-than-working understanding of nuclear physics and computer technology. Obviously, then, to delve into the industry requires access to a substantial amount of intellectual property-- not just anybody can come up with plans for a linear accelerator you can use on a patient.The profound amount of intellectual capital required that makes radiation therapy so forbidding an industry for new entrants helps confer to the current players in the industry-- Varian, Elekta, and Accuray-- significant competitive advantages. As I'll discuss below, these companies benefit from significant barriers to entry into their core markets, as well as switching costs and efficient scale, which, in combination with the above macroeconomic tailwinds, should allow them to generate significant returns on capital for several years to come. Though this article will focus primarily on Varian, the principles discussed should also apply to its rivals, and I view the industry as a whole as an interesting investment prospect.Company and Industry Overview:Varian Medical Systems (NYSE:VAR) is the world's leading manufacturer of medical devices and software for radiotherapy, radiosurgery, proton therapy, and brachytherapy, which are used to treat cancer and other non-malignant conditions. The company also produces X-ray imaging components for medical, scientific, and industrial applications, including cargo screening and industrial inspection. The company has 3 main reporting segments: Oncology Systems, X-Ray Products, and Other (though I'll only be discussing the first two as the ""Other"" segment contributes but a negligible amount to consolidated revenues and net income).(click to enlarge)Source: self-produced. Data collated from Varian 10-Ks.Oncology Systems: The Oncology Systems segment is by far the company's largest and most consistently profitable. The segment designs, manufactures, distributes, and services hardware and software designed to administer various forms of radiation therapy through a variety of modalities, including both conventional external beam therapies (IMRT, IGRT, and volumetric modulated arc therapy) as well as stereotactic modalities and brachytherapy.External beam therapies are pretty much what they sound like: a linear accelerator spins up electrons or photons to generate a beam of x-rays, which in turn is focused and delivered to specific areas in a patient's body. By controlling the shape, direction, and intensity of the x-ray beam, the treatment team (typically consisting of a radiation oncologist, medical physicist, and a radiation therapist trained on the machine and software) can precisely dial in the desired amount of ionizing radiation to the tumor while avoiding or limiting damage to surrounding normal tissue.The ionizing radiation disrupts cellular processes essential for cell division and induces processes that drive cell death (apoptosis). Conventional radiotherapy involves multiple fractionated treatments of a tumor in up to 50 treatment sessions, and therapies are typically highly individualized for patient and tumor characteristics, even accounting for tumor movement and changes in size. The radiation may be given in conjunction with chemotherapy to augment the effect of chemotherapeutic agents, or may be used prior to surgery to reduce tumor size as neoadjuvant therapy. Recent advancements in technology, such as volumetric modulated arc therapy (which allow for even greater control of the radiation dose and beam-shaping aperture), can speed up treatments up to 8x, and allow for even greater dose precision, as the arcing beams dissipate the radiation dose that does hit surrounding normal tissues.In radiation oncology, a premium is placed on speed and precision--faster treatments are better tolerated by patients, allow for greater patient throughput, and reduce cost per treatment (and improve patient access). Greater precision, obviously, reduces side effects of radiation therapy, which are legion (and include fun things like pulmonary fibrosis, coronary artery disease, colitis, you name it), and with that, keep treatment courses short and improve patient quality of life. To that end, all players in the radiotherapy device market must invest heavily in research and development, and refreshing product lines is a key part of Varian's business model. Under typical usage conditions, a linear accelerator (""linac"") will have a lifespan of about 10-12 years; though the lifecycle of a linac may also depend on further advancements in technological capability.Linacs are the key product line of the Oncology Systems segment, and the company produces a variety of linacs designed for a broad array of capabilities and indications. The segment also manufactures linac accessories such as collimators (which help further define the size, shape, and intensity of a radiation beam) that further augment the capabilities of linacs to engage in things like stereotactic radiotherapy or VMAT, and respiratory gating systems (which allow the linac to synchronize the radiation dose with a patient's breathing). The segment also produces software products for treatment session planning, patient positioning, and treatment simulation. In 2013, the segment was responsible for over 76% of consolidated revenues and 78% of total gross profit, growing revenues by about 3%, consistent with historical trends.X-Ray Products: This segment designs and manufactures X-ray tubes, flat panel detectors, and image processing tools, all critical components of x-ray imaging systems. X-ray tubes are used in a variety of diagnostic radiology applications, including CT scanning, fluoroscopy, and mammography, and have uses in non-medical fields like airport baggage inspection systems and manufacturing. Flat panel detectors are used as an alternative to plain x-ray film and image intensifier tubes (both of which are legacy technologies that are being phased out over time).As you might imagine, with equipment being less sophisticated than the linacs produced by the Oncology Systems segment, the barriers to entry for this industry are less formidable, and gross margins for the segment have varied widely over the last decade. Furthermore, due to the increased competition the segment faces, revenues and profits are more subject to pressures from changes in reimbursement rates associated with diagnostic radiology (as a result, for example, of the Affordable Care Act, among other things). In 2013, the X-ray Products segment accounted for 18.5% of consolidated revenues, and 18.2% of gross profit, growing revenues by about 11% year-over-year.Industry Overview:The radiotherapy devices market is remarkably consolidated, particularly after a 2012 agreement reached between Varian and Siemens AG (through which, essentially, Siemens agreed to market Varian linacs and other products). The three biggest players are, by far, Varian, Elekta (OTCPK:EKTAY), and Accuray (NASDAQ:ARAY), which together combined for nearly all of global revenues and profits related to radiotherapy devices in 2013.Source: Self-produced. Revenue and gross profit data collated from Morningstar.Though overall global market share has been fairly static over the past several years, that doesn't mean the industry itself isn't dynamic. Whereas Varian's linacs constitute the lion's share of devices found in the US, Elekta's are the norm in Europe. For both companies, the markets for greenfield installations in developed countries is relatively small as the medical infrastructure has largely matured, and revenue streams from these markets are generally replacement and servicing of legacy systems.The real growth for the industry lays, of course, in developing markets, like China, India, and Brazil. With few capable radiotherapy machines per capita in these countries, patients must often endure long wait times for treatment or suffer no treatment at all. In the United States, Varian estimates there to be about 90 treatment machines per million people over age 64; this number drops to 25 per million in Brazil and less than 15 per million in China and India. The industry as a whole could increase the total number of machines in these countries three-fold and still not come close to Western levels of access to radiotherapy (which is utilized in about 60% of all cancers). As noted in the graph below, the need for radiotherapy machines is particularly acute in Asia and Africa, the latter of which has barely any access to radiation therapy at all.Source: Perez and Brady's Principles and Practice of Radiation Oncology. 2009 Data.Combined with a predicted increase in worldwide cancer incidence (especially in developing countries), the prospects for international growth make the prospects for the industry at large quite interesting indeed. Overall, the overall growth of the RT market is estimated by most analysts to grow at anywhere from a 6-9% rate over the next ten years. Varian estimates that over 9,000 linacs will need to be installed by 2020 to meet the estimated cancer burden, with the majority of those being placed in international markets. Those dynamics are easily seen in the breakdown of Varian's orders by geography, as international orders have made up a growing percentage of total orders over the past decade, with domestic orders leveling off (as greenfield installations in the US and Canada become less frequent).Source: Self-produced. Data collated from company 10-K's.Linear accelerators (and their expensive big brothers, proton accelerators) are capital intensive, complex pieces of machinery, requiring specialized expertise to run properly, and switching costs for hardware (and, to a lesser extent, software) are extremely high. As mentioned above, the intellectual expertise and hardware and software patents represent formidable intangible assets that are difficult for any new entrant to replicate. With the market largely a duopoly (Accuray's share of the market is small and the company remains unprofitable), Varian benefits from efficient scale, though one danger that could upset Varian's profitability would be a sustained pricing war with Elekta. That said, rational pricing appears to be in play, with neither company engaging in value-destructive practices, though a challenge will likely arise as both companies enter into more capital-restrained (and cost-conscious) emerging markets.Investment Thesis and Company Performance:I believe that Varian stands to benefit from a confluence of powerful demographic trends, unmet need for its essential products, and a commanding market position in an industry with high barriers to entry. With the global market for RT devices set to grow, above-average market returns should be possible over the next several years, and the company is primed to continue delivering significant returns on invested capital for the foreseeable future. Over the past several years, Varian has delivered steady revenue and earnings growth, and unlike some of its competitors, throws of tons of cash:VAR Return on Invested Capital (Annual) data by YChartsVAR Normalized Diluted EPS (Annual) data by YChartsRevenue has grown at a steady 6-8% CAGR over the past decade, and with the industry itself set to expand at the mid-to-high single digits rate, that trend looks to continue. The company's steady performance and dominant market position are marked by a steady cash-conversion cycle and steadily improving financial position:Source: self-produced. 10-year financial data sourced from Morningstar.VAR PE Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsOn relative valuation metrics, Varian appears cheaper than its largest rival, with both PE and EV/EBITDA scores coming in significantly lower. With only 2 major players in the market, Varian appears to be best-of-breed.Risks:Changing reimbursement rates, a stagnant replacement-based sales model in the US, and the potential for pricing difficulties in emerging markets all pose risks to Varian. It is far from certain that emerging markets will spend nearly as much money as their Western counterparts on radiation therapy, and given capital constraints, I think it's reasonable to expect that price points will inevitably be lower (though I would also expect rational behavior by both Varian and Elekta to continue). In addition, despite excellent clinical data suggesting its efficacy, usage of radiation therapy as a primary modality for treating cancer varies widely by geography even in developed markets, though the reasons have more to do with government and reimbursement rates than actual science. Convincing European governments to increase spending and alter medical practices will probably take some effort and the outcome is by no means guaranteed.Valuation:My fair value estimate for Varian is $93 per share, with a range of $78-$108. I take the median of the results of a discounted cash flow (""DCF"") model, historical valuation model, and earnings-growth based model to derive my estimate. For my DCF model, I assume revenue growth to hew to historical averages of just slightly over 8% over the next 5 years before slowing to a 5% CAGR for the 10-year period as greenfield linac installations take root and are offset by more replacements. The company's business model and operating costs are remarkably stable, with R&D having held steady around 7-8% of revenues over the past decade, and I assume operating margins and net margins to hold steady at around 20% and 14-15%, respectively, over the 10-year period. This assumption relies upon continued rational pricing by both Varian and Elekta as they enter into emerging markets, as well as upselling customers on linac accessories after installations are completed. I assume a weighted average cost of capital of 8.4%, which drives an FVE of $94. DCF projections are reproduced below.For a historical valuation model, I apply a historical price-to-earnings, price-to-book, and price-to-sales ratio of 20.6, 5.4, and 3.0 to analyst forward estimates, which generates a fair value estimate of $98. Looking at earnings growth over the past decade, the company has routinely traded at a premium to a price predicted by its earnings growth, and despite the recent dip, now is no exception. An earnings based model values the company at $69 per share. The company does not currently pay a dividend.Source: Self produced. 10-year financial data sourced from Morningstar.My fair value estimate implies a 2014 foward PE ratio of 20.4, inline with historical trends and well below the industry average of 30. The estimate suggests an EV/EBITDA ratio of 12.1, modestly higher than the current EV/EBITDA ratio of 11.6. Currently, with shares trading right around the $80 mark, the stock looks at worst fairly valued, and probably offers a decent margin of safety.Quantitative Analysis and Conclusion:Varian appears to offer the prospect of double-digit total returns over the next decade, as its dominant market position in an highly specialized industry afford it the opportunity to create generous returns on capital with little fear of new competition. The company and the industry at large stand to benefit from significant demographic tailwinds as an aging population drives higher incidences of cancer worldwide. Though the risk of lower pricing will come into play as the company enters into emerging markets, its significant intangible assets should provide it with the resources it needs to at least retain market share. I view shares as at worst reasonably valued and more likely trading with a moderate margin of safety, and am strongly considering this as my next stock purchase.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

All these shares were sold pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.SEC Rule 10b5-1 is a regulation enacted by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2000. The SEC states that Rule 10b5-1 was enacted in order to resolve an unsettled issue over the definition of insider trading, which is prohibited by SEC Rule 10b-5. After Rule 10b5-1 was enacted, the SEC staff publicly took the position that canceling a planned trade made under the safe harbor does not constitute insider trading, even if the person was aware of the inside information when canceling the trade. This staff interpretation raises the possibility that executives can exploit this safe harbor by entering into 10b5-1 trading plans before they have inside information while retaining the option to later cancel those plans based on inside information.For example, a CEO of a company could call a broker on January 1 and enter into a plan to sell a particular quantity of shares of his company's stock on March 1, find out terrible news about his company on February 1 that will not become public until April 1, and then go forward with the March 1 sale anyway, saving himself from losing money when the bad news becomes public. Under the terms of Rule 10b5-1(b) this is insider trading because the CEO ""was aware"" of the inside information when he made the trade. But he can assert an affirmative defense under Rule 10b5-1(c), because he planned the trade before he learned the inside information.In general, it is a safer way for an insider to sell shares pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan than without it.Insider selling by calendar monthHere is a table of Varian's insider-trading activity by calendar month.There have been 886,812 shares sold, and there have been zero shares purchased by insiders since January 2013.

2594555,63893,2014-10-24T11:17:42-04:00,"Varian Medical Systems missed both my and Street expectations for revenues and earnings for the quarter, based on a number of one-time items but also some operational difficulties.A higher-than-anticipated tax rate and incomplete financing of a proton treatment center took nearly $0.25 per share off the bottom line, with which the company would probably have met estimates.Though I am decreasing my fair value estimate for the stock, shares remain undervalued, and the long-term prospects for the company have not changed materially.","Shares of Varian Medical Systems (NYSE:VAR) are trading materially lower in after hours action, after the company posted revenues and earnings that missed consensus (and my own) estimates. Having recently gone long on shares, does the earnings miss suggest I made a mistake with my original investment thesis and that a significant reduction in fair value is in order?VAR data by YChartsOperating Results:Net orders for the fourth quarter came in at $1.12 billion, representing a 25% year-over-year increase from the same quarter last year. For the year, net orders of $3.35 billion were 13% higher year-over-year, above historical averages but well within the company's historical norms. Order backlog increased by 10.4% year-over-year, but consolidated revenues for the year increased only by 4%, well off historical norms, as revenue for the fourth quarter increased by only 5.6% year-over-year. Revenues were adversely affected by incomplete financing for the Maryland Proton Center (preventing Varian from booking revenues), which in 2012 had previously been expected to supply some $70 million in revenues to Varian, though the project remains under construction. Completion of the financing for the project would have contributed an additional $0.17 per share to the bottom line. Operating earnings and pre-tax earnings both fell, by 2% and 1%, respectively, as operating expenses as a percent of revenue came in 50 basis points higher (22.3% vs. 21.8%) for the quarter, and taxes on earnings came in substantially higher up 640 basis points (33.9% vs. 27.5%), though the tax rate for the year only rose about 100 basis points. The higher tax rate was influenced mainly by forex effects as well as the delay in the Maryland proton project. As a result of the confluence of the above factors, consolidated net margins came in materially lower for the year, down 270 basis points (13.2% vs. 14.9%).Breaking down performance by segment, Oncology Systems continued to show strong top-line growth, growing revenues by 6% for the quarter, though only growing 4% for the year. Growth was most significant in North America for the year, with gross orders rising 7% for the year versus only 4% internationally. Despite the discrepancy, however, international growth came on strong in the fourth quarter with emerging market orders rising by more than 20 percent, and overall, order backlog improved by over 9% for the segment. Revenues for the more cyclical Imaging Components segment were a bit more disappointing, coming in less than 1% higher for the quarter and only 2.8% higher for the year. Flat panel orders came in lower based on a difficult comparison from a year ago, but future revenues for the segment should be aided by a $40 million order for security and inspection products. Revenues for the smallest and lumpiest ""Other"" segment, which includes Varian's particle therapy businesses, recorded a 30% increase in revenues year-over-year for the quarter, though this accounted for a mere $22 million.Taking a look at the balance sheet, net current asset value by about 20%, from $950 million to $753 million, driven by a substantial decrease in cash. Book value, excluding goodwill, decreased about 8% to $1.38 billion from $1.49 billion, and total stockholder's equity was diminished by about 6% year-over-year.Assessment and Outlook:Overall, results for Varian were moderately lower than I had anticipated, though my view of this miss is tempered by the relatively temporary nature of some of the adverse factors. Varian is not building in any recognition of revenues from its backlog or pending proton projects waiting for completion of financing, and completion of those projects should provide substantial upside to revenues and earnings in FY 2015. That said, with operating cash flow missing my projection by about 10%, and with Varian's management notably going ahead with a staff restructuring and ""enhanced retirement plan"", some operational problems seem to be afoot, and I may need to temper my expectations for the company's margins and cash flow accordingly, until the company proves otherwise. For the upcoming fiscal year, Varian projects top-line growth of 5-6%, and EPS of $4.16-$4.26, materially lower than what I had previously projected.Valuation:After updating my discounted cash flow model and historical valuation model to account for these latest results, I am decreasing my fair value estimate for Varian shares to $88 from $93, with an uncertainty range of $80-$96. For my discounted cash flow model, I continue to project 8% revenue growth over the next 5 years, as the company continues to build out new linacs in emerging and international markets. I project 10-year average revenue growth of 5.3% per annum. I am decreasing my average net margin forecast by about 100 basis points, from 14.5% to 13.7%, as higher taxes and operational difficulties may offset Varian's continued pricing power. As there are only 2 significant players in the radiotherapy devices market, and as there really hasn't been a significant change in the qualities of linear accelerators or proton beam therapy per se (these are still capital intensive, complex pieces of machinery with a built-in recurring revenue base), I feel comfortable projecting these assumptions for a 10-year period. I continue to employ a weighted average cost of capital of 8.4% to discount cash flows. My discounted cash flow model yields a fair value estimate of $87 per diluted share. My historical valuation model now yields a fair value estimate of $92. Projected data are reproduced below.My fair value estimate implies a forward PE of 20.9 for 2015, inline with historical trends, and a forward EV/EBITDA ratio of 12.6, modestly higher than the current EV/EBITDA ratio of 11.6. With after hours action taking the stock down to $77 as of this writing, I continue to see the stock as trading at a considerable discount to fair value, and view shares as attractive, though potential upside is naturally more constrained than I had previously anticipated.Conclusion:Though I am mildly disappointed by Varian's performance this latest quarter and by their forecast for the coming year, I still view the company as best-in-breed and see no reason to change my long-term view of the company or its prospects. Cancer epidemiology is unlikely to radically change over the next decade, and radiotherapy utilization is unlikely to radically decline. Threats to capital expenditures for these expensive machines will continue to surface, and certainly increased taxation is a constant worry. That said, I see no reason to severely constrain my outlook for the company's earnings prospects given these secular trends, though I do think some ""wait-and-see"" attitude needs to be accounted for in my fair value estimate. Even so, shares trade at a material discount to my fair value estimate, and I would be happy to commit more money to the name if shares correct further.Disclaimer: This article provides opinions and information, but does not contain recommendations or personal investment advice to any specific person for any particular purpose.

1489512,47851,2013-06-09T06:54:40-04:00,,"By Robert BrealeyVarian Medical Systems (NYSE:VAR) is trading at $68, down from its 52-week high of $75.8. We are bullish on the stock not only because it is currently undervalued, but it is a stock you can buy and hold without having to worry about every day. Our estimate of fair value is over $85 per share with near-term performance accounting for close to 110% of its current share price.Steady historical performance driven by double-digit growth and profitable business modelOver the past 10 years, VAR has delivered close to 10% in annualized stock return compared to 5% of the overall market. A $100 investment would have become over $228 compared to $160 for the overall stock market. A returns decomposition shows that this stock return is clearly driven by a very high 14.5% earnings growth, with a very low 1% capital retention because of the very high 30% return on equity that it enjoys. A decline in Price-Earnings ratios from 30x to 17x pulled down returns, and positioned the stock for better returns in the future.VAR has delivered consistent revenue and earnings growth and ROE performance over the past 10 years. Revenue growth has been between 10% and 19% for most part except a slowdown to 6-8% in 2009 and 2012. Meanwhile ROE has consistently been between 30 and 40%.VAR's strong financials is grounded in its leading position in a growth industryVAR's outstanding growth and profitability is grounded in its position as a leading supplier of radiation therapy systems to treat cancer. Used in over 50% cancer cases, radiation therapy is one of the least expensive cancer treatments and most effective in terms of cure and overall survival. VAR is the current leader with slightly over 50% market share, with Elekta (OTCPK:EKTAF), Siemens (NYSE:SI) and Accuray (NASDAQ:ARAY) as the other suppliers.VAR is also a strong player in X-ray products, including one of the world's fastest flat-panel digital detectors and imaging software and workstations to produce sharp detail X-ray images for diagnosis. X-ray products account for 18% of total revenue in 2012, growing at 10% annually compared to 8% for the radiotherapy segment.In April 2012, VAR entered into a strategic partnership with Siemens in which both VAR will represent Siemens diagnostic imaging products to radiation oncology clinics in international markets and in turn Siemens represents VAR's equipment and software products for radiotherapy and radio surgery in North America. We see this as a sign of consolidation in already oligopolistic market.With a healthy cash balance, mergers and acquisitions continues to be a way that VAR acquires new products, technologies and customers. In 2012, VAR acquired InfiMed, a privately-held supplier of hardware and software for diagnostic images for $20.8 million, and in 2011, VAR acquired Calypso Medical Technologies, a privately held supplier of specialized products and software for real-time tumor tracking during radio surgery and radio therapy. [Source: 2012 Annual Report]We expect the market for VAR to continue growing at 8-10% annually. As the leading cause of death, new cancer cases diagnosed annually are estimated to grow from 13 million in 2008 to 21 million in 2030, with the total number of people living with cancer compounding at an even higher rate. Currently, the penetration of radiation therapy systems in developing countries like China are still very low and growing rapidly.VAR is undervalued with a significant margin of safetyOur valuation model shows that VAR is valued at $86 per share assuming a steady 9% earnings growth rate for the next 5 years, RONE of 27% and a future price-earnings ratio of 16.8x (which corresponds to a conservative earnings growth rate of 3% to perpetuity). Note that current earnings and near-term earnings growth account for close to 110% of current share price, which gives us a sizable margin of safety. Expected returns in buying and holding this stock for 5 years is over 12% annualized, driven by a high earnings yield of 5.7%, earnings growth of 9%, a small earnings retention as a result of high return on equity, and a small decline in price-earnings ratio.On the other hand, if we were more conservative and assumed a 5% earnings growth for the next 5 years, which we believe is the lowest it can go, a RONE of 27% and a future price-earnings ratio of 15.6x (which corresponds to an even more conservative earnings growth rate of 2% to perpetuity), the value of the stock is at $70 per share, which is still higher than its current value.You can play with our model above.VAR - an Investment You Don't Have to Look At Every DayCurrently, 9 analysts recommend a buy, 3 hold and 2 sell. Average EPS estimate for FY2013 is $4.10, which is 9% above FY2012 EPS of $3.76, and for FY2014, $4.55, which is 10% above estimated EPS for FY2013. Though the EPS growth rates of the 2Q and 3Q are expected to be around 5% compared to a year ago, it appears that the analysts are seeing a catch up in 4Q of over 12% compared to 4Q a year ago.In the bullish market today, it is hard to find companies that are fairly or undervalued. We believe VAR is an undervalued stock by a significant safety margin, an investment you can buy and hold without having to worry about every day.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In Varian Medical Systems' (NYSE:VAR) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $59 per share, in line with where it is currently trading.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Varian Medical Systems posts a VBI score of 3 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the company, its neutral relative valuation versus peers, and bearish techinicals. We use Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG), Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), Waters (NYSE:WAT), and Zimmer (ZMH) for our peer group analysis.To better understand how to read the following report on Varian, please take a couple minutes to view the following short video here and then come right back.Our Report on Varian Medical Systems imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsVarian Medical Systems earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 76.2% during the past three years.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $44, we'd take a closer look at adding it to the market-beating portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter (please see left sidebar more more information).Varian Medical Systems has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 14.2% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 0.3 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 13.7%.The firm's share price performance has trailed that of the market during the past quarter. However, it is trading within our fair value estimate range, so we don't view such activity as alarming.The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 7.9% during the past 3 years. We expect its revenue growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Varian Medical Systems' 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 76.2%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.6%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Varian Medical Systems' free cash flow margin has averaged about 14.8% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Varian Medical Systems, cash flow from operations increased about 51% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 8% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Varian Medical Systems' shares are worth between $44.00 - $74.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $59 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 17.1 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 10.4 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 8.2% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 7.9%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 22.3%, which is above Varian Medical Systems' trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.1% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Varian Medical Systems, we use a 10.6% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $59 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Varian Medical Systems. We think the firm is attractive below $44 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $74 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Varian Medical Systems' fair value at this point in time to be about $59 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Varian Medical Systems' expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $80 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $59 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: ISRG is included in the portfolio of our Best Ideas Newsletter."

It has over 6,000 of its liner accelerators for cancer therapy in use around the world. Its security and inspection group is the market leader in high-energy X-ray devices for non-destructive testing and cargo screening.Its long-term prospects are bright for the following reasons: The service makes up one-third of the oncology department revenues. This is recurring, and management expects this segment to grow as it expands its installed base in China and India. It also introduced the true beam system for image guided radiotherapy and has already landed 425 new orders of which it has installed over 100.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter is 96 cents, representing an estimated year-over-year growth of 11.73%.First Quarter RecapVarian reported first quarter earnings per share from continuing operations of 79 cents, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 76 cents but missing the year-ago earnings of 80 cents per share. Net earnings for the quarter slipped 6.5% year over year to $90.2 million (or 79 cents a share).Varian's top line witnessed an 8% increase to $625 million in the quarter, but trailed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $633 million. Order backlog increased 14% to $2.5 billion at the end of the reported quarter.Oncology Systems' revenues grew 8% year over year to $488 million. Varian benefited from strong demand for its TrueBeam system. Net orders went up 6% to $485 million as an 11% decline in North America was more than offset by 22% growth in international markets. Net orders from overseas markets constituted 60% of net orders received during the first quarter.Varian's X-Ray Products business had a lukewarm quarter with revenues moving up just 1% year over year to $113 million. Sales in the ""Other"" category spiked 56.3% year over year to $25 million. Sales were driven by revenues from the setting up of the Scripps proton system.Estimate Revision TrendAgreementAmong the 11 analysts covering the stock, there were no estimate revisions, for the current quarter, over the past week. There was one instance of revision, in the downward direction, over the past month.Of the 11 analysts, there were again no upward estimate revisions, for fiscal 2012, over the past 7 and 30 days. There was only 1 instance of a downward revision, for fiscal 2012, over the past month. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal year 2012 is $3.95, reflecting an estimated 14.85% year-over-year growth.MagnitudeGiven the relative shortage of estimate revisions, the magnitude of revision for the second quarter has been static over the last week and month. The consensus estimate for fiscal 2012 has remained stagnant over the past week and dipped by a penny in the past month.Varian has produced positive surprises in two of the previous four quarters while it met or trailed estimates in the remaining two quarters. We expect that a similar mixed trend might continue. The company produced an average earnings surprise of 1.02% over the prior four quarters, meaning that it beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by that measure.Our TakeVarian is a leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy systems for treating cancer and a premier supplier of X-ray tubes for diagnostic imaging applications. The company operates in a technology-driven environment where success depends on the use of new technology, product development and upgrades. In the radiation oncology market, Varian competes with Accuray (NASDAQ:ARAY).Varian is poised to increase its market share in radiation oncology. It is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its coveted TrueBeam technology, which is meaningfully contributing to its net order oncology growth.Moreover, Varian enjoys a strong balance sheet marked by minimal debt and sizeable cash. The company uses a part of its healthy cash flows for share repurchases.However, Varian competes with larger players in a technology-intensive industry. Further, uncertainties stemming from health care reform and a still weak hospital capital spending environment across many developed countries, especially in Europe, are significant challenges. We currently have a Neutral long-term rating on Varian supported by a short-term Zacks #3 Rank (Hold)."

(NYSE:VAR) is a global leader in the supply of equipment and software for treating cancer with radiotherapy, radiosurgery, and brachytherapy. The company also sells x-ray equipment and x-ray imaging products along with proton therapy products and a range of other medical equipment and services mainly for the cancer treatment industry.The company is broken up into 3 broad business units:Recent Performance:VAR is a company that has performed wonderfully well over recent history. Its financial performance has earned it recognition in publications such as Forbes and BusinessWeek.Over the past 10 years VAR has achieved topline growth of 11% and normalized EPS growth of 18%. Importantly it has achieved positive EPS growth every year - there have been no hiccups. VAR requires very little debt to grow - its net debt over the past 10 years has been zero along the whole journey. Currently VAR has around $171M in debt and over $600M in cash and cash equivalents giving it a resounding zero net debt. Free Cash Flow totals $2.4B for the past 10 years which equals total net earnings over the same period.Quality Rating:(Click to enlarge)Source: usastockvaluation.comIt is no surprise that VAR scores a reasonably high USAStockValuation.com Quality Rating, even though it scores poorly on EPS growth and return on retained earnings. The Quality Rating model, in its quest to find fast growing businesses, is rather unforgiving on EPS growth and return on retained earnings.Intrinsic Value:(Click to enlarge)Source: usastockvaluation.com(Click to enlarge)The market recognizes that VAR is a great company - and hence has provided few buying opportunities. Not many companies can boast an Intrinsic Value line like VAR - it has been going in one direction only over the last 10 years - up.Management & The Future:Management personnel have been with the company for a long time - so deserve credit for the wonderful performance of the company over recent history. Each of the key executives has millions of dollars of vested interest in VAR in both shares and options.Risks are inherent with all technology companies. A new cancer treatment technology could come along at any time which would turn the existing market on its head. This is a risk that investors in VAR must accept, and a risk that is mitigated to a certain degree through VAR's focus on R&D. The company sells hugely expensive equipment that once purchased by a hospital or clinic is far cheaper upgraded than replaced. This provides VAR with a competitive advantage - VAR is the global leader in the radiation technology market, and the switching costs of its customers is such that it is likely to stay the leader for the foreseeable future. And barring a cure for cancer, the market in which VAR operates is only expected to expand, especially considering the aging population of the developed world.VAR has been expanding globally at a decent rate and that is unlikely to abate any time soon as hospitals and clinics around the world further embrace cancer treatment technologies that have been used in the US for years. Government healthcare policies both in the US and abroad will have an effect on the future performance of VAR - how much of an effect will depend on the country and the specific policies, but these risks are being managed somewhat through an increasingly diverse geographical spread.(Click to enlarge)Source: varian.comConclusion:Investors who want a better opportunity may want to keep VAR on their watchlist (aka ""shopping list"") and wait for a pullback in the market prior to purchase. But for those who can't wait, the current price is certainly a reasonable price to buy a part ownership in a strong company with a bright future.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in VAR over the next 72 hours."

411141,24703,2012-03-05T08:33:33-05:00,,"Varian Medical Systems (NYSE:VAR) is the leading supplier of radiation therapy systems used to treat cancer. The company's shares currently trade well below intrinsic value, which we estimate at just under $100. We see an opportunity for the shares to move higher based on a number of important secular drivers.Radiotherapy is a Critical TechnologyCancer is a disease involving the malfunction of genes that control cell growth. Uncontrolled growth of cancerous cells can result in death. However, abnormal cell growth can be controlled or eliminated through several types of treatments. Radiation therapy, commonly referred to as radiotherapy (RT), uses focused energy beams (primarily x-ray) directed at cancer cells to damage or destroy them. RT, which is used in just over 50% of cancer cases, may be used alone or in combination with other treatments that include surgery and chemotherapy. Given that radiation exposure is harmful to healthy tissue, the objective is to deliver a radiation dose as precisely as possible to cancerous cells while minimizing exposure to healthy tissue surrounding the tumor.According to the American Cancer Society, U.S. men have slightly less than a 50% lifetime risk of developing cancer while women have just over a 33% chance, both of which are alarmingly high. However, advancements in cancer treatments, including RT technology, have dramatically improved cancer survival rates. According to the National Cancer Institute, over the past three decades the relative survival rate has increased to 67% from 49%.RT systems represent expensive capital purchases for hospitals and clinics, but the technology is very cost effective when measured on a per patient basis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), ""radiotherapy is one of the least expensive cancer treatments per patient and one of the most effective in terms of cure and overall survival.""VAR is the Market LeaderConsolidation among RT companies has resulted in three main suppliers. VAR's installed base of RT systems approached 6,900 units as of FY11, which compares to an industry-wide installed base of approximately 12,700 units. The company's market share is particularly high in key developed markets where it has 70% share in the U.S. and Japan. The other two leading suppliers include Elekta (OTCPK:EKTAF) and Siemens (NYSE:SI); Accuray (NASDAQ:ARAY) is a third but smaller competitor. In November 2011, Siemens announced that it would ""selectively exit"" the RT market, a decision that should ultimately result in further share concentration among VAR and Elekta.Significant Long-term Growth OpportunitiesWorldwide, there is an estimated shortage of 10,000 RT systems, creating a significant opportunity for suppliers. Demand for RT technology has grown at a robust pace over the past decade, a period that includes two recessions. Over this period, VAR's Oncology Systems segment revenue (78% of total company revenue) grew at a 13% annual rate, while overall services revenue increased 20% per year.Over the next decade, we estimate RT system sales growth of 10% per year driven by 6%-7% unit and 3%-4% pricing growth. VAR's services revenue will likely grow at an even higher rate (low double-digits) driven by the sale of more sophisticated RT systems and growth in the installed base. There are three key drivers fueling secular growth: 1) replacement unit sales in developed markets, 2) new unit sales in international markets, and 3) an overall increase in cancer incidence.First, advancements in RT technology are driving replacement demand in developed markets. In general, developed markets have sufficiently large installed bases of RT systems per capita (this is generally measured as the number of RT units per one-million people). Thus, RT unit purchases in developed markets are dominated by replacement sales, or purchases of new systems to replace outdated legacy ones. These sales comprise 85% or more of North American demand.In FY2Q10, VAR introduced its latest system, TrueBeam. This product significantly enhances the accuracy, productivity and flexibility of RT treatments. Improved accuracy enables hospitals and cancer clinics to better treat patients, while greater productivity enables faster treatment times. For example, simple treatments that once took 10 to 30 minutes can now be completed in less than two minutes. Further, TrueBeam is a more flexible system meaning that it is capable of treating several different types of tumors, as opposed to RT systems that specialize in specific treatments.Through last quarter, cumulative TrueBeam orders totaled 425 units, of which 175 are installed. Despite the challenging domestic economic and regulatory environment (e.g., reductions in government reimbursement rates for RT treatments and a looming excise tax on medical device sales beginning in 2013), VAR has seen strong demand in North America, which represents the large majority of TrueBeam orders to date. The company estimates a total available market for TrueBeam of over 2,200 units worldwide, which implies that VAR is less than 20% of the way into its potential sales cycle for this product.Second, there is a shortage of RT systems overseas. According to WHO, the global installed base of RT systems averages only 1.8 units per million people. We estimate that this equates to approximately 12,700 units worldwide. Many developing countries lack sufficient access to RT technology given high equipment costs and technical expertise necessary to operate the systems. As shown in Figure 1, the secular growth opportunity for RT shipments is enormous given underinvestment in healthcare infrastructure in developing countries. VAR estimates that the global installed base would increase by 10,000 units assuming the worldwide average number of installed systems per million people were to approximate that of Western Europe.Figure 1Certain developing regions with large populations are experiencing rapid economic growth and higher standards of living. As incomes per capita increase, demand will rise significantly for more effective cancer treatments such as RT. To better understand this opportunity, we point to key healthcare initiatives in Brazil, China and India, which in aggregate are home to almost 40% of the world's population.Third, cancer incidence rates (number of new cancer cases occurring each year) are increasing. Cancer is the second-leading cause of deaths after cardiovascular diseases. WHO estimates the number of new cancer cases diagnosed annually will grow from 12.7 million in 2008 to 21.3 million in 2030, a 2.4% annual increase (note that these are new cancer cases each year, not the number of people living with cancer which is a much higher total). This trend is driven by two underlying factors, aging populations and unhealthy lifestyles.The global population is aging as life expectancies have increased dramatically over the past half-century driven by advancements in medicine and sanitation. Cancer is largely an age-based disease as the risk of being diagnosed increases as one grows older, particularly at age 55 and over. As of 2010, this older population segment totaled almost 1.2 billion people (roughly the size of China's entire population), representing 17% of the world's population (up from under 12% in 1950). By 2030, this percentage will increase to 23%, or about 2.0 billion people.The pace of population aging varies widely. While every major geographic region is impacted by a growing number of older residents, growth rates for this population segment are dramatically higher in developing compared to developed regions (3.3% annual growth rate versus 1.5%). As this trend continues, cancer incidence rates will grow more rapidly in the emerging markets.Figure 2(Click to enlarge)The other driver of higher cancer incidence is unhealthy lifestyles, which include tobacco use and poor diets. Tobacco-related cancer cases, the leading cause of lung cancer, represent 25-30% of all cancers in developed countries. While tobacco use has decreased in some developed regions, it is increasing in developing countries where 85% of the world's population resides. Further, poor nutrition and obesity contribute to 33% of cancer deaths in the U.S. Obesity has more than doubled over the past thirty years, with over 33% of U.S. adults currently obese.Intrinsic Value Approaches $100 per ShareThe above secular trends will drive higher revenues for VAR. The company is also increasing profit per revenue dollar, so earnings should grow at an even higher rate than revenue. In FY01, VAR's operating margin was only 14%, but this improved to almost 23% as of last year. Going forward, management has set a 25% goal. We see four factors that will contribute to higher sustainable margins.First, product innovations such as TrueBeam lead to higher selling prices and margins. TrueBeam represented 40% of VAR's FY11 global orders, and margins will improve as this product ramps. Second, as the revenue mix shifts towards services, margins will increase (services gross margin is in the low 50% range compared to a mid-40% range for RT systems). VAR estimates services can grow from just over $600 million in FY11 to $1 billion by FY15, representing a 12.4% CAGR. Third, the software content of RT systems is increasing. Software, which includes radiation treatment planning, real-time tumor tracking, image processing, equipment diagnosis and maintenance software tools, carries high margins. Finally, we expect VAR to gain market share given Siemens' decision to reduce its presence in RT. This will result in positive operating leverage as VAR spreads fixed costs over more unit sales.Higher profitability combined with significant revenue growth opportunities will translate into meaningfully higher cash flows. This is consistent with VAR's historical cash flow trend and indicative of the company's rock-solid balance sheet. VAR has largely reinvested cash flow back into its business, an excellent use of cash given its high ROIC, which has exceeded 30% in each of the past 7 years. If VAR can achieve 10% annual revenue growth in its Oncology Systems segment and drive operating margins towards 25%, then we estimate an intrinsic value per share of almost $100. If this estimate is remotely accurate, then VAR shares will provide above-average annual returns to long-term investors.Disclosure: I am long VAR."

The company had earlier forecast earnings per share in the  range of 80 cents to 83 cents for the quarter. The current Zacks  Consensus Estimate for the third quarter is 83 cents, representing an  estimated year-over-year increase of 12.7%.Second Quarter RecapSecond quarter earnings per share of 86 cents beat the Zacks Consensus  Estimate by a penny. Revenues were up 11% year over year (up 9% on a  constant currency basis) to $648 million, beating the Zacks Consensus  Estimate of $640 million. Order backlog rose 11% to $2.2 billion at the  end of the reported quarter. Growth was led by increase in net orders  for TrueBeam system, Oncology services, X-Ray tubes and panels as well  as security systems.Oncology Systems’ revenues grew 9% year over year to $508 million,  boosted by healthy demand for the company’s radiotherapy, brachytherapy  and radiosurgery systems. Varian’s X-Ray Products business had a strong  quarter with revenues cruising 15% year over year to $118 million aided  by some recovery in the global imaging market. Revenues from the Other  category increased 20% year over year to $23 million.Estimate Revision TrendAgreementAmong the 10 analysts covering the stock, there were no estimate  revisions for the current quarter over the past week or month. Of the  10 analysts covering the stock, there were again no estimate revisions  for fiscal 2011 over the past seven or 30 days. The current Zacks Consensus  Estimate for fiscal year 2011 is $3.47, reflecting an estimated 17.2%  year-over-year growth.  MagnitudeGiven the lack of estimate revisions, the magnitude of revision for the  third quarter has been static over the last week and month. Estimates  for fiscal 2011 have also remained stagnant over the past week and  month.Our Take on Varian Varian is the world’s leading manufacturer of integrated radiotherapy  systems for treating cancer and a premier supplier of X-ray tubes for  diagnostic imaging applications. In the radiation oncology market, the  company competes head-to-head with Accuray Incorporated (NASDAQ:ARAY).Varian is poised to increase its market share in the radiation oncology  market. The company is currently enjoying a healthy demand for its  coveted RapidArc and TrueBeam radiotherapy technology. However,  uncertainties stemming from healthcare reform and a still weak hospital  capital spending environment across many developed countries,  especially in Europe, pose headwinds. We currently have a Neutral  long-term rating on Varian supported by a short-term Zacks #3 rank."

In Varian's (NYSE:VAR) case we think the firm is worth about $45 per share, slightly lower than where it is currently trading. Our full reports on Varian Medical Systems and hundreds of other companies are available on our website.We think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale.

Our Report on Varian Medical Systems   Click to enlarge images     Investment Considerations  We rate every company in our coverage universe on 13 unique measures. To get started, we show Varian's below:Investment HighlightsVarian Medical Systems earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 79.3% during the past three years. The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $35, we'd take a closer look. Varian Medical Systems has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 15.7% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 0.1 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 3.3%. The firm's share price performance has trailed that of the market during the past quarter. However, it is trading within our fair value estimate range, so we don't view such activity as alarming. The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 9.9% during the past 3 years. We expect its revenue growth to be better than its peer median during the next five years.

Economic Profit Analysis
The best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Varian Medical Systems's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 79.3%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.

Cash Flow Analysis

Valuation Analysis
Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Varian Medical Systems's shares are worth between $35 and $58.00. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $46 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 15.5 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 8.9 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 6.8% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 9.9%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 24.2%, which is above Varian Medical Systems's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, our valuation model assumes free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 2.7% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Varian Medical Systems, we employ an 11.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows. 


Margin of Safety Analysis
Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $46 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock.
In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Varian Medical Systems. We think the firm is attractive below $35 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $58 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion. 

Future Path of Fair Value
We estimate Varian Medical Systems's fair value at this point in time to be about $46 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Varian Medical Systems's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $64 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $46 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.

232693,20568,2010-10-27T12:55:30-04:00,,"Varian Medical Systems (VAR)  is slated to report fourth quarter fiscal 2010 (ending September 30)  results on Thursday, October 28. The company expects earnings per share  in the range of 80 cents to 83 cents for the fourth quarter and in a  band of $2.90 to $2.93 for fiscal 2010. The current Zacks Consensus  Estimate for the fourth quarter is 84 cents, representing an estimated  year-over-year increase of 8.04%.Third Quarter RecapVarian posted third-quarter 2010 adjusted (excluding one-time items)  earnings per share from continuing operations of 74 cents, beating the  Zacks Consensus Estimate of 65 cents. Total revenue was $578 million, up  13% year over year in constant currency, ahead of the Zacks Consensus  Estimate of $569 million.Varian's net orders came in at $629 million, up 15% in constant  currency. The backlog at the end of the quarter stood at $2.1 billion,  up 7% year over year.Revenues from Varian’s Oncology Systems segment, consisting of  radiotherapy, brachytherapy, and radiosurgery products, amounted to $456  million, up 6% year over year. Revenues from the company’s X-Ray  Products segment, consisting of X-ray tubes and digital detectors for  imaging without films, stood at $102 million, up 52% year over year.  This segment benefited from rapidly growing demand for medical,  industrial and security-oriented X-Ray products.Estimate Revision TrendAgreement: Estimate revisions for the fourth  quarter and fiscal 2010 are equally biased in the upward direction. Out  of a total of 11 analysts currently covering the stock, one raised  his/her estimate in the past week, with two upward revisions in the past  month. There were no downward revisions over the same timeframes.Magnitude: The magnitude of estimate revision  for the fourth quarter has been static over the last week and month.  With regard to fiscal 2010, there was an increase of a penny over both  the past 7 and 30 days. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal  2010 is $2.94, representing an estimated 10.81% year-over-year increase.Our Take on Varian Varian is a leading manufacturer of radiotherapy systems for treating  cancer and a supplier of X-Ray tubes for medical and industrial imaging.The company is poised to increase its market share in the radiation  oncology market. International markets are under-equipped to address the  growing incidence of cancer.  In line with growing demand for cancer  treatment in overseas markets, Varian’s ex-U.S. sales, in Europe and  particularly Asia, are growing at a faster rate than in the domestic  market.Service constitutes about one-third of Oncology segment revenues, which  is recurring in nature. It is expected to further grow as the company  expands its installed base in overseas markets, particularly in China  and India.However, Varian aggressively competes with well-funded competitors for a  limited pool of sales volume. Moreover, hospital capital expenditure is  still restrained in the U.S., affecting the company’s domestic  business. The macroeconomic problems, and resultant austerity measures  in Europe, may affect its faster-growing international business.   We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Varian over the long  term.  The stock currently retains a Zacks #2 Rank, which translates  into a short-term Buy recommendation."

114975,21618,2009-01-15T13:15:33-05:00,,"The market was very weak Wednesday; the Dow dropped 250 points or 2.9% to 8200. The Nasdaq wasn't any stronger, dipping 3.67% or nearly 59 points to 1,489, and the S&P was off 3.35% or 29.17 points to 842.62.However, in the midst of this ongoing bear market, I continue to look for companies which appear to meet most of my own criteria. Tuesday, Varian (NYSE:VAR) made an 8+% move higher on an upbeat forecast for fiscal 2009. Unfortunately, with the market weak on Wednesday, the stock gave back about a half of its gain closing at $35.62, down $1.34 or 3.63% on the day. This stock however deserves a second look.Varian is definitely an 'old favorite' of mine on this blog. I write this because I first wrote about Varian on October 20, 2003, more than five years ago! Two years later, on May 11, 2005, I once again wrote up Varian on Stock Picks. I do not currently own any shares or options on this stock.But I do still like Varian's business and their fundamentals remain impressive.Regarding its business, as described by the Yahoo ""Profile"" on Varian, the companyIn a very morbid fashion, cancer is a growth business. There are few people that will get through life without dealing with this disease themselves or with one of their own close family members as I have personally related. In fact, as the World Health Organization relates on their website:Healthcare business, while relatively insulated from economic trends, is also feeling the effects of the economic downturn as this story relates. However, the pain felt in many cyclical businesses is far greater than the effects of the global economic slowdown on health-related businesses and employment.This relative strength in healthcare was reflected in the recent employment report which noted every industry losing jobs ""...except education, health care, and govenrment."" Which brings me back to Varian Medical Systems. On January 12, 2009, Varian announced that in the first quarter of fiscal 2009, there would be a net growth in orders between 12 and 13% ahead of the year-ago period. Tim Guertin, president and CEO of Varian noted that this performance was in the face of continuing economic stress:Furthermore, Varian late last year announced a continuation of a stock repurchase plan, with the authorization to pick up an additional 8 million shares of stock in 2009. As the company reported:Stock repurchases are helpful in supporting and advancing the price of a company. Let's take a closer look at some numbers behind this company as reported on the Morningstar.com ""5-Yr Restated"" financials. First of all, we can see a very pretty picture of steady revenue growth from $1.24 billion in 2004 to $2.07 billion in 2008. Earnings have also increased in an uninterrupted fashion from $1.18/share in 2004 to $2.19/share in 2008. At the same time, outstanding shares, as explained above, has been decreasing from 142 million shares in 2004 to 128 million in 2008. Free cash flow, as reported by Morningstar, has been positive and growing with $160 million in 2006 increasing to $291 million in 2008. The balance sheet appears solid with $397 million in cash and $997 million in other current assets. This total of $1,394 million, when compared to the $781.7 million in current liabilities yields a current ratio of 1.78. Varian has a relatively small amount of long-term liabilities reported to be $166.7 million. Reviewing a few ""Key Statistics"" on Varian from Yahoo, we can see that this stock is a mid cap stock with a market capitalization of $4.43 billion. The trailing P/E is a moderate 16.26, but with strong growth expected, the PEG is reported at a very nice 0.87 level.Checking the Fidelity.com eresearch website, we can see that in terms of the Price/Sales ratio, Varian is relatively inexpensive with a Price/Sales [TTM] ratio of 2.24 compared to the industry average of 6.15.The company is also relatively more profitable than its peers with a Return on Equity [TTM] of 31.49% compared to the industry average of 14.24% per Fidelity.Returning to Yahoo, we find that there are 124.25 million shares outstanding with 123.37 million that float. As of December 10, 2008, there were 7.11 million shares out short representing 4.6 trading days of volume (the short ratio), which is a bit more than my own '3 day rule' for significance. We may have seen a bit of a 'squeeze' of the shorts yesterday on the back of the good news announcement. No dividend is paid and the last stock split was a 2:1 split back on August 2, 2004.Finally, let's take a look at the chart with a 'point & figure' graph from StockCharts.com:Here we can see that after hitting a 'double-top' in August, 2008, at $65.00, the stock broke down and continues to trade with lower lows and lower intermediate highs to the current level around $35.62. I see little to indicate any technical strength in this chart unfortunately.However, I am not currently prepared to buy shares in Varian nor any other new position. The decision to buy a new holding will only result after one of my current holdings hits an appreciation target on the upside. Needless to say, in the current market, my holdings are moving in rather the opposite direction!But in the midst of this depressing trading milieu, I continue to remain optimistic long-term and continue to look to identify the quality companies that are able to persistently grow revenue, earnings, free cash flow, and possibly dividends, while maintaining solid balance sheets and reasonable valuation. Except for the weak chart, Varian is quite impressive and has easily earned a place in my blog!"
228633,23408,2010-10-06T04:12:45-04:00,,"Varian Medical Systems (NYSE:VAR) and IMRIS said Tuesday  they have agreed to co-develop a new MR-guided radiation therapy system  for use in treating a number of cancers with increased accuracy.Under the terms of the agreement, the two companies will develop a  system that combines IMRIS' MR imaging technology with Varian's recently  introduced TrueBeam system, to allow for the use of magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI) during radiotherapy treatments for cancer.Launched in April 2010, Varian's TrueBeam system for radiotherapy and  radiosurgery has the ability to deliver treatments up to 50% faster,  with a dose delivery rate of up to double the maximum of earlier Varian  systems.By leveraging IMRIS's technology and integrating the detail of MR  imaging with the delivery capabilities of the TrueBeam system, the two  companies expect to enhance the effectiveness of radiation therapy, they  said.Dow Wilson, president of Varian's oncology systems business said:The new treatment is being designed to allow a high-field MRI scanner  to move in and out of the radiation therapy room on demand, providing  MR imaging to precisely confirm a tumor's location prior to treatment,  and again during the session as needed, all without having to transport  the patient.IMRIS first began development of its MR-guided radiation therapy  program in 2008, in collaboration with the University Health Network  (UHN) in Toronto, Canada. An IMRIS 3T MR-simulation suite was installed  in 2009 at UHN's Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto.Princess Margaret will provide Varian and IMRIS with clinical  expertise and the environment necessary for building the first of these  new systems, they said.said head of radiation physics at Princess Margaret  Dr. David Jaffray.Following the development of the project, the companies anticipate  co-branding the system, giving Varian the responsibility to market the  new product.More than 10 million new cancer cases occur throughout the world each  year, and in the U.S., about half of all cancer patients receive some  type of radiation therapy during the course of their treatment,  according to chairman and CEO of IMRIS, David Graves.Palo Alto-based Varian Medical manufactures medical devices and  software for treating cancer and other medical conditions with  radiotherapy, radiosurgery, proton therapy, and brachytherapy.The company supplies informatics software for managing cancer  clinics, radiotherapy centers and medical oncology practices, and  supplies tubes and digital detectors for X-ray imaging in medical,  scientific, and industrial applications and also supplies X-ray imaging  products for cargo screening and industrial inspection.IMRIS' imaging systems serve the neurosurgical, cardiovascular and  neurovascular markets.

That $28.79 break-even point looks to be a pretty low-risk level as it’s lower than the absolute worst share prices hit during the entire period 2004 through February of this year.

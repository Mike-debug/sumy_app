Although Workday should be benefiting from the present cloud migration, its guidance doesn't reflect that side of the story.The stock appears to be fully priced relative to its near term potential, as it already trades for more than 11x forward sales, even though its revenue growth rates are clearly decelerating with each passing quarter, while at the same time its multiple remains elevated -- particularly compared with its peers.On balance, investors can find better investment opportunities elsewhere. Particularly since the market has opened up slightly these past several weeks.Workday is the category-defining leader platform for finance and human resources. Workday's applications are aimed at facilitating financial management and human capital management (''HCM'').The most attractive reasons to be bullish Workday include this cloud SaaS business having very strong visibility. Investors have a clear understanding of its progress and are willing to pay a large multiple for a lack of downstream surprises (more on valuation later).Workday's application streamlines financial processes for organizations through a single platform, as well as offering large global enterprises a human resources platform to manage their workforce.Furthermore, given that it's aimed predominantly at enterprise customers, in the event of a slowing of the economy due to small businesses closing down their doors, Workday should be relatively immune. What's more, Workday sees market dynamics improving towards the back end of fiscal 2021 and early fiscal 2022.Hence, given the acceleration of digitalization seen throughout the world and companies' migration towards the cloud, we should expect this to provide Workday with very fertile ground and positive tailwinds to continue growing rapidly. Yet, rhetoric aside, Workday's hard numbers don't appear to be backing up that story.Source: author's calculations; **high-end company guidanceWorkday's guidance appears to point towards a dramatic deceleration in revenue growth rates. If this time last year, during fiscal Q2 2020 Workday was a plus 30% y/y revenue growth rates company, this year's 20% y/y growth rates comes across as a rapid deceleration in comparison.What's more, looking ahead for the rest of fiscal 2021, Workday's revenue growth rates don't appear to regain much vitality. As a sanity check, please consider what analysts expect from Workday over the next several quarters:Source: SA Premium ToolsBulls would claim that management is lowballing estimates to allow for easy beats. And that's obviously taking place. After all, Workday is a SaaS company and they have a very strong idea of what the next 90 days look like, and possibly even what the next year looks like.In short, SaaS companies don't miss estimates unless something goes dramatically wrong.However, Workday did highlight the loss of contract, where a customer was forced to prepay the remaining balance of the contract. This amounted to $6 million pull forward from several years' worth of contract which all fell into Q2 2021.Moving on, after adding back its heavy stock-based compensation, Workday is guiding for fiscal 2021 non-GAAP operating profits to reach approximately 18%. This means that despite heavily investing in its top-line growth strategy, its non-GAAP operating income should reach slightly under $775 million. Readers should note that due to COVID, Workday has reduced travel, marketing, and event spending.On the plus side, unlike many cloud SaaS peers, Workday is able to convert its revenues into cash flows at a high rate. During H1 2021, its revenues converted into cash flows from operations at approximately 20%. Put simply, this means that Workday's non-GAAP operating income is largely in line with its cash flows from operations.Thus, on the one hand, investors can feel reassured that Workday's revenues are converting into cash at a high percentage. On the other hand, investors should remember that this figure doesn't take into account Workday's consistent real estate project capital infusions. However, most likely due to COVID, Workday states that for the remainder of fiscal 2021 it would not make further investments into real estate projects. Nonetheless, at this valuation, Workday's margin of safety is non-existent.Workday's fiscal 2021 revenues are pointing towards $4.3 billion -- this is at the high-end of its revenue target. This leaves Workday trading for just over 11x sales. This is in no way an exuberant valuation in and of itself, particularly amongst SaaS stocks. However, given the market reaction the last several weeks, it appears that investors are now starting to question whether it is truly worthwhile to pay a large premium for just about any stock in the SaaS space.Yext (YEXT) has similar growth rates and guidance to Workday, yet Yext trades for approximately 5x forward sales. Meanwhile, Salesforce (CRM), which trades for 10x forward sales, and practically the same multiple as Workday, yet Salesforce is still guiding for solid 20% growth rates over the next several quarters. For now, investors are going to struggle to see meaningful upside potential from Workday. Even if there's a strong thrust by companies to continue to accelerate their digitalization and move to the cloud, that line of the narrative is already being priced in here.For more upside potential, Workday needs to positively surprise investors, that it can re-ignite its growth rates and return to being a high growth rate company, but given its full-year guidance, even if one assumes 1% to 2% top-line beats, Workday is still not likely to return towards being a 20% CAGR stock. There are better investment opportunities elsewhere, with less risk."
4353427,104952,2020-06-11T18:15:42-04:00,"Workday is an attractive investment opportunity, given its deep moat in the enterprise HCM and Financial Management, steady growth, and strong cash flow generation.The sticky client base and its high-quality licensing business model will help in weathering the ongoing uncertainty.We expect a sustainable +20% growth with potential operating margin expansion above its 16% target in the near term.","We believe that Workday (WDAY), the SaaS Finance and HR giant, presents an attractive long-term growth investment opportunity. Workday is one of the most disruptive players in the enterprise SaaS HCM (Human Capital Management) and Financial Management market. Over the last five years, revenue and FCF (Free Cash Flow) have grown by ~5x and ~9x consecutively. Despite being a +$3.6 billion-a-year business, Workday also still maintains a +20% growth with steady FCF profitability. In this first coverage of Workday, we will take a closer look at its high-quality business model and strategic go-to-market approaches, which we believe should allow the company to maintain its resilience and outperformance. We assign the stock an overweight rating.We expect the strategic focus on client base expansion to drive growth and margin expansion. As the ongoing uncertainty may negatively affect the sales cycle for new deals, we believe that Workday will instead continue to benefit from targeting its client base. In doing so, Workday should drive growth and profitability by incurring lower marketing expenses and focusing on quicker wins with add-on sales. Over the last few quarters, the company has reportedly achieved a 100% net retention rate as the add-on business has seen rapid growth.(source: company's 2019 analyst day slide)In Q1, the add-on business maintained its momentum as Workday achieved its first-ever $1 billion revenue quarter with $1.02 billion quarterly revenue, up 23% YoY. Assuming that a significant portion of the growth for 2020 will come from the existing client base and that Workday has comprehensive add-on offerings in its fast-growing Financial Management segment, we think that the +20% growth is highly sustainable.(source: company's 2019 analyst day slide)Furthermore, the operating margin would have been at 20.6% instead of ~12.8% if the company did not pay the one-time bonus payment for its employees amid the pandemic. Consequently, while the 12.8% operating margin in Q1 already demonstrates a strong expansion from that of FY 2019, we continue to see upside potential in margin expansion this year, driven by further delays on non-critical programs and traveling. As the company will also add more resources to target the growing install base opportunity through a more focused approach, we feel that Workday can potentially outperform its full-year 16% margin guidance.Workday's high-quality business model helps weather uncertainty. We have also gained some insights into the mechanics of Workday's licensing model in Q1, which we think is highly robust and resilient despite based on a per-user pricing scheme. As described by the CFO Robynne Sisco, the licensing contract only recognizes the changes in the number of users on an annual basis, effectively leaving no room for unpredictable changes in the contract value accordingly. The company also applies a minimum base contract value, which can only be reset at a renewal:Despite the sticky customer base, Workday would have also been in a good position to invest in its go-to-market further to land new logos this year. During the analyst day last year, we noted the company's compelling vertical go-to-market strategy in growing the adoption of its Finance Management offering.(source: company's analyst day 2019 slide)As the company has decided to focus more on its install base for the foreseeable future given the ongoing uncertainty, we accordingly expect a slowdown in the Finance Management segment, which, unfortunately, has been the fastest-growing business for Workday.In our view, Workday has all the characteristics of an attractive large-cap tech and growth opportunity. It has a deep moat in the enterprise SaaS HCM and Finance Management with many large companies like Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA), Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPE), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its client base. Furthermore, the offering has proven to be disruptive as well, as shown by the exponential growth in revenue and FCF over the last five years. Last but not least, the client base stickiness stands out to us. At ~11x P/S, we consider Workday attractive enough, considering the strong positioning to reaccelerate growth through both new logos as well as client base expansion going forward, coupled with the adequate profitability lever. Given the expected 20% growth and potential FCF margin expansion to ~18% this year, the stock is only 2 points shy of passing the rule-of-40, which is a very minor problem that another one or two earnings surprises will fix. We maintain our overweight rating on the stock."
4371669,103480,2020-08-31T09:48:14-04:00,"Shares of Workday soared to new all-time highs after reporting second-quarter results.
        The company's beat-and-raise soared above expectations, though revenue growth still decelerated.
        Workday has been impacted by the slimming-down of HR and other non-essential teams amid coronavirus cost-cutting efforts.
        It's difficult to justify Workday's ~12x forward revenue multiple for a company whose growth has sunk beneath 20%.","Workday (WDAY) is one of several large-cap tech companies that have benefited from a surge in investor interest after Q2 results turned out to be far better than feared. Salesforce.com (CRM), the original and leading cloud company, soared >30% after the company reported a blowout Q2 and announced that it would focus a little more on profitability and cut out jobs. Workday in turn followed suit with its own blowout quarter, and shares of the cloud HCM provider have jumped to new all-time highs following the print.While it's difficult to disagree with the strength (or rather, the better-than-feared numbers) coming out of Q2, I turned from very bullish on Workday to neutral last quarter and am holding my ground with that stance. The reason is that, despite Workday's best-in-class offerings across both HCM and finance software, the company is competing in very competitive and potentially saturated markets, and the deceleration we're seeing in Q2 won't subside even when the coronavirus is in the rearview mirror. Meanwhile, Workday's valuation has climbed up to very optimistic levels. At Workday's current post-earnings, all-time high share prices of $244, the company has a $57.31 billion market cap. After netting off the $2.75 billion of cash and $1.79 billion of debt on Workday's most recent balance sheet, its enterprise value is $56.35 billion. For the following fiscal year FY22, meanwhile, Wall Street analysts are expecting consensus revenue of $4.91 billion, representing 17% y/y growth (per Yahoo Finance). That puts Workday's valuation multiple at 11.5x EV/FY20 revenue. That multiple, unfortunately, is out of line with where other software companies expected to grow in the mid-teens are currently trading. Here's a representative list of other mid-teens growth SaaS comps:To me, this represents substantial risk should the market decide to enter a risk-off mode and devalue expensive tech stocks. In my view, if and when the broader macroeconomy/coronavirus conditions ease in the back half of this year, we'll begin to see more funds rotate out of richly valued tech names and back into some of the beaten-down sectors like energy and banks. Workday's optimistic multiple leaves it exposed, and in my view there's too little reward with Workday already trading at record levels to take on this risk.Keep watching this name from the sidelines. Let's now review Workday's most recent quarterly results in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Workday 2Q21 resultsSource: Workday Q2 earnings releaseNow, there are plenty of strengths in this quarter to acknowledge - and that's why I'm neutral rather than outright bearish on Workday. My position is simply that Workday's current stock price already compensates for this strength, not that the company's fundamentals itself is weak.Investors in particularly cheered the better-than-expected growth. Heading into Q2, expectations were not high for Workday given that its leading product - human capital management (NASDAQ:HCM) software - is priced per employee. With overall headcount at many companies going down, that doesn't bode well for Workday's revenue expansion within existing clients. And due to the fact that Workday administrators tend to sit in HR departments (a big area for cutting among most companies looking to conserve cash), Workday HCM was slated to have a bad quarter.But while some of this impact certainly came into play, the results were far more benign than feared. Workday grew revenues at 20% y/y to $1.06 billion, beating Wall Street's expectations of $1.04 billion (+17% y/y) by a healthy three-point margin. We do note, however, that Workday's revenue, as expected, did decelerate three points versus Q1's growth rate (and note that as recently as last year, Workday's growth had clung closer to the ~30% mark. At that time, Workday shares had also traded at a low-teens/high single digit multiple - so we have to ask ourselves, given that Workday's growth has come down from those levels, shouldn't its valuation multiple also compress to compensate?) Another point to consider: Workday also commented that the company benefited from a $6 million pull-forward of revenue from a specific customer contract. After stripping that out, actual revenue growth in the quarter would have come in at 19% y/y. However, perhaps even more important than the raw numbers was management's commentary that hinted at a near-term recovery after the impact of the pandemic hit hard in Q2. Chano Fernandez, who Workday recently elevated from co-president to serve as co-CEO alongside founder Aneel Bhusri, noted as follows on the Q2 earnings call:It's important to realize that many other software companies have not echoed Workday's comments in hoping for an improvement in market conditions by year-end. It's also encouraging to hear Workday speak of the pandemic as a catalyst in triggering more cloud software adoption among its customers. And in accordance with this bullish commentary, Workday has also posted strong Q3 guidance calling for 19% y/y subscription revenue growth - though considering Workday's history of achieving above guidance and its 23% y/y subscription growth this quarter during a very pandemic-impacted period, I think there is room for upside on top of that.Like Salesforce, however, one of the real main draws of Workday's quarter was its improvements in profitability. Thanks to reductions in sales and marketing spend and the stoppage of travel, Workday was able to lift its pro forma operating margins in Q2 to 24.3%, up eleven points relative to just 13.2% in the year-ago quarter. We note that this positions Workday very favorably from a so-called ""Rule of 40"" perspective - adding up Workday's revenue growth percentage to its pro forma operating margins yields a score of 44. We are cautious of the fact, however, that many of the cost savings achieved this quarter may not be fully sustainable, given that a one-time ""credits related to cancelled events"" helped boost the margins this quarter. Indeed, the company has called for its Q3 margins to fall to 19% (five points down sequentially from Q2), and for full-year margins to clock in the 18% range (which is two points stronger than its prior view of 16%).There's certainly a lot to like about Workday with the company performing far better than expected amid the pandemic. Workday's bet of expanding its suite of products beyond HCM and into tools like finance and supply chain are also paying off. With that being said, it seems many investors have forgotten the critical role that valuation should play in an investment decision. In my view, Workday has a strong potential to unwind some of its gains - investors don't want to get caught holding a hot potato."

It was also its first ever $1 billion revenue quarter.Workday's first quarter revenues grew 23.4% to $1.02 billion, ahead of the Street's forecast of $1.003 billion. Non-GAAP EPS was $0.44, ahead of the market's forecast of $0.37.GAAP net loss increased to $158.4 million compared to a loss of $116.3 million a year ago. It included $79 million in a one-time bonus payment of two-weeks' pay for all non-executive employees to tide over the crisis. During the quarter, Workday added 150 new employees, bringing its total workforce to 12,400.By segment, Subscription services revenues grew 25.8% to $882 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $830 million. Professional services revenues grew 10% to $136.4 million.Cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $2.6 billion as of April 30, 2020.Workday primarily serves a large and medium enterprise market that is better positioned than SMBs to weather this downturn. Its licensing model is based on the number of workers but also has base minimums to limit the downside. While there may be some moderation in retention rates in the near term due to increased bankruptcies and reduction in base work accounts, Workday does expect retention rates to remain high as it believes that it is very strategic to its customers.For the second quarter, Workday expects subscription revenue of $913-$915 million or 21% growth and professional services revenues of $128 million. Workday lowered its subscription revenue guidance for FY21 to $3.67-$3.69 billion or 19% growth from $3.755-$3.770 billion. It expects professional services revenue of $500 million in FY21. For Q2, total revenue is expected to be $1.041-$1.043 billion, ahead of analyst estimates of $1.037 billion.The guidance range is slightly wider than normal and assumes that Q2 and Q3 will be the most challenging periods with improvement in Q4.During the quarter, Workday was selected as the core HCM vendor by the City of Los Angeles, one of the largest city governments. It added several new HCM customers including insurance company Jardine Matheson with over 50,000 employees in APJ and utility company John Lewis Partnership with over 80,000 employees in EMEA. Workday expects the COVID-19 crisis to lead to a growing emphasis on its sweet spot of learning and talent marketplace.Workday's Financial Management product has over 900 customers, Fortune 50 company Fannie Mae, Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government, Okta, as well as a large healthcare company with over 60,000 employees. Accounting Center is one of the new products gaining traction that will enable customers to analyze their robust loan portfolio. Workday expects the COVID-19 crisis to be a catalyst for people to switch from on-premise into the cloud for finance.Last year in November, Workday acquired online procurement platform Scout RFP for $540 million. During its first full quarter under Workday, Scout RFP achieved multiple Fortune 500 wins, including a large healthcare company and wins at Lowe's and Albertsons.For its Enterprise Planning product, Workday expanded its partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) so that Workday customers can run Workday Adaptive Planning on Microsoft Azure Cloud. Microsoft will be adopting Workday Adaptive Planning for its global finance teams to help them with their planning, budgeting, and forecasting. A partnership was also announced with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) to help organizations safely return to work.In March, it made several product enhancements. It enhanced workforce planning with Workday Adaptive Planning. It added new machine learning-based skills capabilities with Workday HCM to verify current employee skills and support reskilling efforts. It also announced new data visualization and benchmarking features with Workday Prism Analytics. It made available Workday Assistant, an intuitive chatbot to guide employees.Last month, Workday moved Workday Extend, formerly called Workday Cloud Platform, to General Availability. The Extend platform allows customers and partners to build and customize to build applications and extensions on top of the delivered capabilities in Workday to meet their unique business needs. Workday is now bringing its two extensibility solutions - Workday Extend and Workday Integration Cloud - together under a single portfolio. Last year, Workday Integration Cloud reportedly supported over 115 million customer integration requests.Workday Extend has been in limited general availability for several quarters and customers have used it to build several mini apps or extensions. One of its customers has built an app to track cases of COVID-19 around the globe for manufacturing plants. A major media customer worked with Workday services to build and deploy an app for its essential employees to log hazard pay during the pandemic.A Workday partner is beginning work on an app to support the return to workplaces as COVID-19 restrictions ease. The app will offer an organization's employees a convenient way - within Workday -to self-assess every day for possible symptoms, and help determine if it's safe to work at the office.In addition, IBM and PwC are creating Workday Extend apps to help Workday customers navigate the effects of COVID-19.Workday Extend is focused on extensibility for its customers and not on opening up an ISV community to build commercial applications. Over 50 customers had built over 90 different solutions on the Extend platform. Workday expects Extend to be a high growth contributor in FY22 and beyond. With this development, Workday has cemented its position as a top cloud stock.Its stock is trading at $183.43 with a market capitalization of $43 billion. It hit a 52-week high of $226.83 in July last year and a 52-week low of $107.75 in March this year.Original postEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

Given its ability to pivot to a largely fully virtual platform, even though its salesforce is somewhat muted at present, it delivered a reassuring set of results.Taken together with overall market euphoria, investors remain fully unperturbed by its decelerating revenue growth trajectory it expects for full-year fiscal 2021.At the most superficial level, Workday had a strong quarter, reminding investors that it is well-positioned for the new normal environment. But below the surface, a different landscape starts to emerge:Source: Author's calculationsAs a reminder, approximately 87% of Workday's revenue is subscription based. The remainder is its Professional Services revenue which amounts to close to 13%.Workday's Professional Services revenues are consulting fees for deployment and optimization services, as well as training. In other words, these are set-up fees that are more likely than not one-off at the time of contract initiation.Furthermore, not only is its Professional Services revenue stream non-profitable on a GAAP-basis, but if we also add back its stock-based compensation, payroll tax related items, amortization to make this figure non-GAAP, thereby adding-back the $23 million, even then, its non-GAAP gross margins reach 1%.Accordingly, we can surmise that Workday's Professional Services revenue stream is not meaningful economically accretive to its operations. Thus, we are left with Workday's Subscription Services to guide us as to its actual prospects.Backlog is a leading indicator, offering investors visibility ahead. Last year, Workday's backlog was up 30.0% year-over-year. This time around, its revenue backlog growth rate has decelerated to 20.5%. One of the reasons being what Co-President Chano Fernandez noted during the call that deals are getting pushed out in this uncertain period.For full-year fiscal 2021, Workday's guidance points to its Subscription Services growing at ~19%. Given that for Q1 2021 its Subscription Services was up 25.8%, and that for Q2 2021 it has guided it to be up ~21%, this implies that for the first half of 2021, its Subscription Services should be growing at north of 22% (weighted), whereas for the remainder of the year, there should be further deceleration, so that the whole year ends up growing at 19%.During the call, analysts tried to get any sort of qualitative commentary from management, but management was understandably tight-lipped about its near-term prospects while at the same time assuring investors that Q4 2021 and early fiscal '22 should see Workday's momentum pick back up.Source: Author's calculationsInvestors are paying a large premium for stability and visibility. For now, Workday's revenue growth trajectory is less predictable than its valuation requires."

Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.I basically do not try to call quarters. While I try to do a lot for the subscribers of my Ticker Target service, I rarely find myself trying to call quarters. And this article, despite its timing, is no exception. Once upon a time in my distant past as an institutional analyst, it was part of the job. Hedge funds and others expected the effort. Overall, it was a paradigm of the thrill of victory versus the agony of defeat. Needless to say, without an informational advantage, it was hard to consistently provide quarterly calls - and informational advantages are subject to -shall we say significant regulatory scrutiny.Workday (WDAY) is set to announce earnings for its quarter that ended April 30, 2020 after the market close on Wednesday, May 27th. I am not going to try to call the company’s quarter. The preponderance of the evidence that is more or less publicly available, i.e. commentary from resellers and SI’s suggests that this is not going to be a strong quarter. And given what Workday sells, and the current environment, that is not terribly surprising.Why write about WDAY shares now? Simply put, the company reported an inflection when it released its earnings at the end of February. Growth, particularly growth in RPO or subscription backlog, showed far stronger trends than had been anticipated. The strength was both far more than had been anticipated and it was strength in all product categories including the recently under-performing HCM segment. In another time, and in another market, the shares would have seen far better performance. Now, of course, fiscal Q1 is to be reported. Expectations are pretty low as mentioned. To a certain extent, the shares are likely to get a free pass since “everyone knows” that HCM bookings must be weak due to the huge loss of jobs across corporate America. Of course I am not going to second guess that - I have no evidence to do so. But neither will I forget just how strong the company had been performing at the end of its prior fiscal year-with the CFO commenting that fiscal Q4 had not been a back-end loaded quarter and thus there was plenty of momentum with which to start the new fiscal year. I will suggest that for investors looking for a recovery name, and feeling that the recent spike in valuations have left them without decent choices, considering Workday shares at this time and this valuation makes sense. Not the excitement of a Shopify (SHOP), or a Crowdstrike (OTC:CRWD) of course, but a reasonable investment, at a reasonable valuation that has gotten overlooked in the panic and then in the ensuing recovery.Workday shares have been performing relatively poorly over the past year since concerns were raised about the company’s HCM potential growth-they are down by 22% over the past 12 months, which compares to a gain of 24% for the IGV and of 27% for the CLOU index. It is hard to actually rate how investors reacted to the company’s last quarter results which were announced on 2/27. The market had started into free fall at that point, and while the company’s shares were up nominally the day after the earnings release, as March wore on, the shares skidded to a low of $113, or a 34% loss by March 18th compared the $171 price on February 27th. Since that time, the shares have appreciated by 49%, although they remain below the high they reached on February 18th, and are flat, year to date. By comparison, the IGV has recovered 38%, and the CLOU index (WDAY is, after all a cloud name) has appreciated by 52% over the same span and both have appreciated noticeably on a year-to-date basis.As a result of this kind of performance, for the first time essentially since WDAY has been a public company, its valuation on an EV/S basis has slipped to average for its low 20% growth cohort, using consensus values for 12 month forward revenue. Over the years, WDAY has become consistently profitable on a non-GAAP basis (yes the company still has far too high a level of stock based comp at 24-6% for my approval) and its free cash flow margin, which reached 17% last year, and almost 26% last quarter is significantly greater than average for its growth cohort which I peg in the low 20% range.WDAY shares are likely to appeal to a more conservative growth investor. This is not likely to be a story of hyper-growth, and the shares are no longer priced that way, either. This is not Shopify (SHOP) or Okta (OKTA), either. If investors are looking for hyper-growth, Workday shares are not the place to search. The question that is going to be explored in the balance of this article relates to the opportunity that this company has in a post Covid-19 world to return to growth in the low-mid 20 percent range, with continually improving gross profits. I think that will likely happen, and the shares are not currently priced for that expectation, and thus I recommend them.I haven’t recommended WDAY shares for some time now. In point of fact, in the past I have raised questions about some particular points of accomplishment over the past couple of years, and have suggested that the shares made no sense for retail investors. That was then, and the relative valuation is such that I want to revisit the story. Workday is not a virus stock - the shares are not likely to be first past the post in a virus recovery scenario. This is not a work-from-home story or a new security solution or even an identity management product set. For those unfamiliar with what Workday does, the name is a rather good clue. The heart of the company is its Human Capital Management solutions which are rated #1 by third party consultants and have been for the past 4 years. In addition, the company offers a set of planning and financial management solutions as well as analytics. The applications also are rated top of class by Gartner and others. Perhaps in 2020 not the most exciting set of products and clearly not the products that have been 1st priority for many users. But there are more than a few shoots - green and other bright colors that make it reasonable to look at the name again for a certain class of subscriber to this blog.When investors have looked at WDAY shares in the past couple of years, the issue has been how fast will financials grow, and how fast will HCM’s growth decelerate. Some time past, the company acknowledged what has been evident for awhile, now; the cloud based HCM space while still expanding with Workday continuing to gain market share - is just not enough to keep the growth rate anywhere close to 30%. The question is: Can the growth in financials start to fill in for the growth hole left by the decline in HCM revenue performance? That is the issue that will be explored in the balance of this article - although to relieve any suspense on the part of readers, last quarter, HCM had a substantial growth spike that was not really anticipated by me or other observers.Last quarter seems so long ago at this point, but it is probably worth reviewing if for nothing more than to set the stage. Revenue growth for the quarter was about 24%, better than feared at that time. Revenues for the quarter were about 1% greater than the company had previously forecast.Non-GAAP operating margin climbed by more than 300 basis points for the full year, but was flat last quarter. Operating margins were also greater than forecast for the quarter. Operating cash flow rose by 42% last year and was 24% of revenue, better than previously forecast. As mentioned earlier, Workday uses a substantial amount of share based comp. That didn’t change in the prior fiscal year, and is unlikely to change greatly in this year.The company reports a metric called subscription backlog. This metric is essentially the same as RPO of which I have written on several occasions. It rose by 23% year on year last quarter and now represents 2.3 years of revenue-a substantial non balance sheet asset. Backlog growth was more than 15% sequentially, a very strong figure and the strongest figure on a percentage basis for all of fiscal 2020. The quarterly increase in deferred rose by 12% year over year, a significant component of the increase in operating cash flow. That figure too, was the highest of the fiscal year. The RPO backlog is the absolute best way to evaluate to look at the company’s success in the market. There are, to be sure, elements in RPO that vary by quarter and aren’t terribly germane in terms of looking at business success. But that 15% sequential growth was a block-buster number for a business of this size; it was a dramatic and underrecognized inflection that should notionally had lead to a massive share valuation rerating.Back then, the company provided a rather positive outlook for both the quarter to be reported Wednesday and for the full year; that outlook was more optimistic than analysts had been projecting and was one factor that lead to decent share price performance for a day in the midst of overall market declines. Subscription revenue growth was then forecast to be 22% for the year, with Q1 growth expected to reach 25%. Specifically, the company forecast that its HCM subscription revenues would rise in the high teens, while the revenue growth in FinApps would be in the high 40% range. The growth forecast in HCM subscription revenues was far better than feared, and frankly far better than I expected to see given the saturated nature of the HCM market as a whole which had been expected to achieve a CAGR of 8%-9% over the coming years by 3rd party observers. Self-evidently, that kind of growth implies substantial market share gains in an extremely competitive market, although it appears as though Microsoft (MSFT) Dynamics may be growing a bit faster on an apples to apples basis.It would be difficult not to be positive about this company’s future if its core technology could actually achieve such a forecast. What has probably happened to HCM bookings since the time of the conference call is an artifact of the time of the virus. Fewer employees, means fewer employees to track which probably has a direct impact on Workday HCM bookings. What hasn’t been discounted, however, is the possibility that the longer-term future of HCM is much, much better than is embodied in the current valuation for the shares.So, what do I think is going to happen on Wednesday? Needless to say, estimates for Workday have come down since it last gave guidance. The current First Call consensus revenue estimate for the quarter has fallen to $1 billion, which compares to guidance of $1.01 billion-not much of a reduction. That kind of estimate change really doesn’t accurately depict the cut in expectations in response to the economy. Most of WDAY’s revenues in a given quarter comes from the balance sheet, and not from subscription revenues generated in a specific quarter. Even for the full year, which is a better depiction of the anticipated impacts of the economy on this company’s sales performance, revenues which had been expected to be $4.360 billion are now anticipated to be $4.27 billion-just a 2% reduction in expectations. Most likely, the largest elements in sales underperformance will be seen in the metrics for RPO and for calculated billings. Calculated billings growth might fall from the low 20% range that had been anticipated to a high single digit number. I would expect a similar or perhaps greater decline in the percentage change for bookings-this company will almost certainly see some of its customers who themselves are seeing financial issues, cease paying in advance, and building the deferred revenue balance.The impact of the economy on the company’s earnings and cashflow is not expected to be substantial. No one has published a reduced estimate for EPS, and the analyst at Cowen, who lowered his rating and price target, did so without changing his EPS estimate.The impact of the economy on Workday’s expected results is certainly no secret. It ought to be obvious that in an economy where layoffs have been huge, there will be substantial pressure on Workday’s HCM business-which employs seat based pricing as its standard. At the least, the acquisition of new users within the HCM space must have been unusually difficult for this company during late March as users tried to react to the shutdown of the economy on their own operations.I am not entirely sure that current estimates for the quarter to be reported adequately account for an unprecedented situation in the last weeks of a quarter that is typically back-end loaded in any event-although it may have been less back-end loaded this current quarter. But equally, I am not too sure how much most investors/shareholders are going to care. The impact of 36 million layoffs in the economy on this company is more or less history at this point. Just how well the company was able to close business this April is not a great sign-post for how well this company will be able to close business during a recovery scenario.To reiterate, what seems to have been lost in the weeks since the company last reported was just how strong HCM results were last quarter, and equally how strong guidance was with regards to growth in that sector. In fact, that inflection essentially went uncommented by most analysts as they rushed to reduce estimates to take account of the closing of many workplaces and to find their own epiphany of virus stocks-which certainly never included Workday. In fact, the shares are almost uniquely disdained by analysts in the ratings as reported to First Call, with just 12 buy recommendations out of 39 ratings. The last rating change to be made on these shares was a downgrade by the Cowen analyst in late April who complained that the company was more dependent than some peers in selling to SMB’s during the quarter. I think the analyst at Cowen apparently overlooked the very high RPO ratio and strong growth in that metric I pointed out earlier. Just before the Cowen downgrade, came an upgrade by the Morgan Stanley analyst. Overall, the reactions to either the upgrade or the downgrade have been negligible.Management speculated that the surprising success that the company had seen in its Q4-HCM results was somewhat influenced by its customers, just below the mega-enterprise level, buying suites. I am not sure what the cause may have been; what I think is fairly obvious is that because of the exact timing of the earnings release, the news was lost in the chaotic panic that marked the first few weeks of March. But besides the spike in HCM bookings, last quarter was a halcyon period for financials. It has been a long, long time coming, and analysts-and that includes this writer-have been speculating about when the company might achieve a real breakout in the growth of FinApps. That time was last quarter.Regardless of the specifics of the April quarter, the preponderance of investors will be focused on guidance and some forecast regarding the shape of a recovery. The economic situation brought on by a response to the virus is unprecedented. It isn’t something that has analogs in the great financial crisis or the internet bubble. So how a management might respond in terms of forecasting a recovery is a total guess. All I can observe is that the company had a surprising level of momentum when the crisis struck both in HCM and financials, and I have seen nothing that might suggest that the momentum it had will not continue when the economy emerges from its shutdown, both in the US and around the world. I am going to speculate that guidance will be better than feared, at least when it comes to the decline in bookings growth-but that is just a guess on my part and not based on a crystal ball or an informational advantage.The CEO believes that its next large market is going to be financial services. The company closed a major deal at KeyBanc (KEY), a relatively large financial services win, to go with that company’s Workday HCM deployment. As many readers will recollect, the company bought Adaptive Planning just prior to its IPO. KeyBanc wanted a financial solution that included planning as well as transactions on a single platform. That has bee part of the WDAY message since it acquired Adaptive and this is one of the more high-profile wins for a total platform over that time period.For some time now, this company has achieved growth in HCM because of market share gains, primarily against Oracle, but also against SAP. It appears that the trend accelerated in the prior quarter during which several newer Oracle cloud based HCM Installations were displaced because they could not be deployed. It is hard for this writer to validate exactly what happened to whom and when, and why it happened, but I have little reason to doubt that the displacements, reported by the CS analyst did not take place or were outliers. There is simply no other way for Workday, at the scale it has achieved, in HCM to have high-teens growth in the space without continued substantial displacements of both Oracle and SAP - and that is almost invariably going to be associated with successful or unsuccessful deployments.When considering acquiring a position in Workday, one of the themes is that its technology - both in HCM and in FinApps have lead to successful deployments, and in turn, successful deployments are a significant factor in the market share gains the company has been able to achieve.The company’s co-president is Chano Fernandez, basically the head of sales and field operation. Since his arrival, the company has focused on defined verticals such as financial services, professional business services, health care, education, and government. This has proven to be a very successful strategy - in particular, there were large wins last quarter in healthcare and in professional business services. It has taken a couple of years for the strategy to bear fruit…it did so in the last quarter. How much of this will have been disrupted by the impacts of the economy on demand is hard to tell - and not terribly relevant for longer-term investors. The share price, to a greater or lesser extent, is discounting a poor results for the March quarter, and not much in the way of guidance specific to Workday and its recovery.Last November, Workday acquired a vendor called Scout RFP. Scout is a company with an on-line procurement platform. Workday paid $540 million for the acquisition which was an enormous premium compared to its latest post-money valuation. Scout’s competitors are primarily SAP-Ariba (SAP) and Coupa (COUP). Scout is going to be integrated into other Workday solutions including Procurement and Inventory. Workday has been taking measured steps to acquire capabilities in most significant back-office functionality in order to compete more substantially with SAP and Oracle. The broader footprint should allow WDAY to compete more efficiently and to streamline its overall selling motion. Scout is not likely to move the growth meter greatly in 2020-but e-procurement is a dynamic space and I think the revenue opportunity for Workday is quite substantial. The acquisition of Scout will inhibit the rise in operating margins and in free cash flow by as much as 150 basis points next year. I will just say it here-Scout is not likely to have a material impact on the success of Coupa - it doesn’t need to in order to deliver positively incremental results for Workday.Do all of these initiatives add up to mid-20% growth for Workday for a couple of years? I think they do - and it is the basic reason why I have chosen to take this opportunity to recommend the shares once again.Workday is a profitable company although even at this point, its profitability remains based on non-GAAP presentations. That has been so for years now, and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. I might like to see a different structure in terms of costs so that the company generated GAAP profits, but it is not terribly relevant in this discussion.Over time, subscription services has been an increasing proportion of revenues, and that is a trend I expect to see maintain into the foreseeable future. Subscription has higher gross margins than professional services. Subscription gross margins reached a bit more than 84% on a GAAP basis last quarter, compared to a bit less than 84% in the prior year. As mentioned, the company saw no leverage at scale last quarter. This was mainly a function of a somewhat more rapid growth in research and development costs than for the other opex expense categories. Overall, research and development expense grew by 25% last quarter and by 28% for the year. As mentioned the company is trying to build-out additional capabilities in many of “back-of the house” applications - it is likely to be a winning strategy.As mentioned the company has raised its non-GAAP operating margin projection to 14.5% for the current year. I am inclined to believe that this will not happen. The company, despite its size is still growth oriented and it is likely to take advantage of talent acquisition opportunities which will probably result in opex rising more rapidly than revenue.For the year as a whole, stock based compensation was 24% of revenues. Most of the stock based comp is generated on the research and development line where hiring activities have been concentrated. Stock based comp growth will probably recede this year because of some lesser increase in hiring, but I do not think it will stop, overall, anytime soon.The company’s free cash flow margin is also continuing to grow. Overall, free cash generation rose by 22% last quarter and was 25.6% of revenues. The company had been anticipating a free cash flow margin to decline in the current year based on a spike in capex. Given that the capex is related to data centers to handle greater transaction capacity I do not think it likely the company will try to skimp on that expense. In addition, the company had budgeted a substantial sum to acquire additional real estate. This company is not a real estate titan such as CRM, but it still manages to spend 5-6% of its revenues on real estate year on year.There are plenty of analysts and plenty of numbers that have different estimates for this company as it goes through the trough of demand due to its exposure to HCM and the overall slowdown of the enterprise IT market. I have presented such estimates elsewhere. What I think should be the focus of investors was the obvious inflection of demand in fiscal Q4, and the likely continuation of that trend as the virus wanes. The company’s EV/S ratio is around 9X, just about average for its growth cohort - but as explained, the growth opportunities for this company are substantial and not entirely in current growth estimates. The company is far more profitable than average, albeit with a fair amount of stock based compensation.Unbeknownst to many, the shares of Workday have become a GARP story, and a good GARP story. I doubt that the opportunity to acquire these shares based on a GARP valuation will long continue. I think positive alpha is highly likely for the balance of 2020 and beyond."

Workday established itself as a leader in human capital management about 10 years ago. Nowadays, the company strives to expand its suite of offerings to help businesses with finances, planning, and procurement, as we will discover later on.Workday’s HCM simplifies recruiting, employee benefits, talent management, and human resources. Workday’s FINS software focuses on payroll solutions, auditing through AI, and a variety of other finance services.With nearly $7T being invested in ""digitizing the workplace,"" Workday operates at the center of an explosive secular growth trend. The uncertainty and market turmoil has therefore created an attractive entry point for this stalwart cloud provider, which is led by one of its original founders, Aneel Bhursi.Today, I am going to illustrate how Workday will continue to increase its free cash flow (which is being disguised by aggressive re-investment at present) by continuing to generate revenue from its core HCM business, while it looks for strong growth in its relatively new FINS business.Source: Analyst Day Late 2019Workday has established a strong customer base for its HCM platform and will continue to generate revenue from current and future partners, as evidenced by its 95% retention rate. The company has been expanding its FINS services and plans to fully develop one suite, within which companies have all the tools they need to drive maximum efficiencies in their HR and finance departments.Source: Analyst Day Late 2019So let's dive into HCM!Managing human capital is often a pain point for businesses as it can often be more of an art than a science, but Workday’s HCM software leverages data analytics and deep learning, by which it assuages this pain. That is, its platform is designed to use data analytics to enable medium and large enterprises to optimize the time and resources of their HR staff.In October of 2019, Aneel Bhusri, said in an interview that there is a ""20% penetration in the human resources market."" In that, only 20% of current large scale enterprises have transitioned away from their legacy, on-premise systems into a cloud-based environment. This represents the immense opportunity for Workday to grow its HCM customer base as the market expands, while offering a host of other products, such as FINS.Source: Analyst Day Late 2019Workday has been able to increase its customer base by over 2000 customers while capturing 40% of the Fortune 500 companies. With the growing trend of digitizing and making ""smart"" human capital management, Workday will continue to win in this market.The core human capital management market (and to a greater extent, the cloud-based HCM market) is expected to steadily increase in the U.S as well as internationally. The global market for human capital management is expected to increase 11.7% in CAGR from 2020 to 2027. At the heart of this trend, Workday stands with 97% customer satisfaction rate since 2012. This rate demonstrates it offers a strong service and that the company will be able to expand its markets within the U.S. and internationally, as can be seen below.Source: Analyst Day Late 2019In 2019, Workday generated 76% of its revenue from the U.S., but the company is eyeing global growth for the long term.As can be seen below, in 2015, Workday generated greater than 95% of its revenues from HCM alone. Today, the mix is less concentrated, which likely assuages investors' fears that Workday may be a one-trick pony, so to speak.Source: Analyst Day Late 2019The financial component of Workday's business brings accounting, consolidation, procurement, projects, reporting, and analytics into one financial management system. The software gives its customers a platform to understand how their company is performing. Here are FINS' services:Source: Analyst Day Late 2019Currently, the company is focusing on growing this segment, since they see large room for growth in financial management software. In October’s interview (linked above), Bhusri said that there is only a 5% penetration in these finance services. Moreover, Workday has developed a strong foundation in this segment. For example, Workday has created a system that performs audits that are fast and cuts costs using AI. It also has an established system that operates in 190 countries markets, which gives them an international advantage over competitors since they’re able to offer their services globally.And understanding the tax laws (not to mention labor laws) of 190 countries is certainly no small feat!Talk about a strong moat!Source: Analyst Day Late 2019Workday’s suite combines the HCM and FINS software to create a full enterprise resource planning system. According to Bhusri, Workday receives 50% of its business from existing customers and the other 50% from new HCM customers. The single system will allow the company to upsell customers who are drawn to its HCM system.HCM has been the driver for revenue and has been generating lots of cash for Workday, as evidenced by its 70.63% gross margins. Workday is currently reinvesting in its business segments, namely FINS, aggressively so as to generate stable, strong top-line growth. In 2019, the company spent $1.2 billion in research and development and another $1.5 billion in 2020!Source: YChartsAs can be seen below, the company is actually generating steady free cash flow, and its multiple is the lowest it's been since it went public.Source: YChartsL.A.

4348534,102101,2020-05-18T14:58:18-04:00,"Workday is trying to carve out a niche for its self in the mid-market space.It is planting seeds that will germinate to the surprise of competitors.The market has been distracted by the COVID-19 induced volatility.When the dust settles, Workday will remerge with tough to match capabilities beyond the HCM space.I will be initiating a bullish rating based on its unique go-to-market strategy.","Source: Property Portal WatchWorkday (WDAY) has been abandoned due to fear of growing competition, execution worries, and the COVID-19 induced market volatility. Workday's revamped strategy is unique, and it has laid the foundation to outperform its peers. The combination of its cloud-focused capabilities in HCM, extending into and beyond the financial management space will evolve to stun competitors. When we throw in its subdued valuation compared to its peers, the potential for revenue growth acceleration and margin expansion on a strong FCF margin, investors will find that Workday is undervalued.As a result, I will be initiating a bullish rating in the long term.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)Market OpportunityWorkday provides HCM and financial management tools for enterprises of all sizes. Its previous focus has been on large enterprises. The HCM market is valued at $18B. Due to its expanded capabilities, Workday now addresses a bigger TAM (total addressable market), which is valued at $88B. This extended TAM includes capabilities in business analytics, accounting, financial management, and procurement. A significant portion of Workday's goal is to simplify and automate the processes in the office of the CFO. While it attempts to penetrate this space, it will come in contact with competitors of varying sizes, intent, and capabilities. These include established ERP vendors like Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP), and niche players like Anaplan (PLAN), Coupa (COUP), Zuora (ZUO), and Smartsheet (SMAR).PotentialThe rapid adoption of cloud platforms (induced by the acceleration of digital transformation projects and the work from home theme) will continue to drive the demand for Workday's offerings. This adds to its expansion into other verticals like finance, healthcare, education, procurement, and accounting. While some of these new bets are yielding results, others will take some time to be accretive to revenue.Going forward, management is guiding for high teens growth in its HCM solution and low forty-percent growth for the finance-related products. Scout RFP (spend management) is expected to contribute less than 1% of total revenue in FY'21. ScoutRFP was recently acquired to extend its capabilities in finance (spend management).If Workday succeeds in its product integration and go-to-market strategy, its added capabilities will continue to sustain double-digit growth in the mid-teens to low 20s range. Consistent double-digit growth of its existing customers and high single-digit greenfield growth will be more than sufficient to drive margin expansion. This will be built off the strong international revenue growth of 33%, which now represents 25% of overall revenue.This isn't farfetched, given its historical ability to execute. Gross retention rate stands at 95%, while DBNER remains above 100%. It will be nice to have more color on DBNER. The peg at +100% suggests expansion from the existing base isn't much given the strong greenfield wins, which include 11 new Fortune 500 customers for HCM, 100 new Prism customers, and over 350 planning customers.Given the strong momentum in its financial management offering, Workday has the ability to produce yearly revenue growth in excess of 20% in the next two years. This factors in slight impact to SMB revenue in the aftermath of COVID-19 and a rapid contribution from ScoutRFP. This also includes high single-digit growth in professional services in line with management's guidance.Source: Author (using data from Seeking Alpha)ProductsFinancial management: for the simplification of financial processes. Includes a soon to be released accounting center to automate accounting processing, and improve reporting and analysis using data from different sources. Includes procurement and spend management module from the acquisition of Scout RFP. Scout RFP had the highest rating, according to Gartner's peer insights review of the strategic sourcing and application space. This space also includes Coupa and SAP Ariba sourcing suites. In the peer review, Scout RFP had a 50% overlap with both SAP and Coupa. Workday wasn't ranked in Gartner's procure-to-pay magic quadrant; however, it was listed in the honorable mentions category. Coupa is the highest-ranked vendor in the procure-to-pay space.It appears there isn't much difference between spend management and procure-to-pay. According to Ariba:Two companies listed in Gartner's procure to pay review started out as spend management solutions. Coupa also uses a lot of spend management jargon on its website.Human capital management: for talent and workforce management. Includes recruiting, payroll, time tracking, learning management, compensation management, and talent optimization. Historically, this has been geared towards large enterprises. Workday's HCM solution ranks in Gartner's leadership position for HCMs. Workday is now marketing its new PaaS (platform as a service) capabilities to beef up its weakness. Its website features use cases from companies like Netflix (NFLX), Flex, and Accuride. The growing adoption of its PaaS capabilities has the potential to accelerate growth. Providing a platform for developers to be creative with its products will drive deeper market penetration of its offerings. Though, Oracle and SAP won't sit back to watch this scenario unfold. I expect a solid response from them, given the depth of their sales and marketing arm.Insight and analytics solutions (Prism Analytics): resulted from the acquisition of Adaptive Insights. Includes HR analytics, people analytics, and DaaS (data as a service). It helps customers meld external data with data generated from Workday's solutions to drive actionable insights. The greenfield wins from Prism announced in the last conference call were impressive. This suggests customers are finding a good use for Workday's analytics capabilities amid the tons of data they analyze. The datasheet for the prism analytics offering shows it integrates with CRMs, point of sales solutions, and survey platforms. This might indicate its intent to expand into the experience management space as it dovetails nicely with its HCM offering.Workday industry solutions: for educational institutions (Workday Students), project management, and healthcare institutes. This entails admission to curriculum management for students and procurement to the analytics stage of healthcare projects.Like Veeva (VEEV), Workday is testing the range of its capabilities. It has achieved a decent level of success in the HCM space. It hopes to replicate this success in other verticals. If it succeeds, this strategy will ensure EPS, FCF, and its growth factor aligns to uphold multiple expansion.FinancialsHCM subscription growth is decelerating. This is more of a weaker expansion from existing customers than greenfield wins. This also explains Workday's expansion into other verticals.Workday is hard at work to expand the capabilities of its mothership (human capital management) by expanding into other verticals while moving into the midmarket. The midmarket has two formidable players in Paylocity (PCTY) and Paycom (PAYC) who are both focused on the US market. Automatic Data Processing (ADP) and Paychex (PAYX) focus on smaller businesses relative to Paylocity and Paycom. The success of Paylocity and Paycom in the mid-market is a combination of experience, culture, strong management, and strategic partnerships. This is not a feat that Workday can achieve overnight. However, there's no harm in trying.If it comes down to it, I expect to see a lot of discounting to gain market share. Also, the midmarket space is sensitive to the shock to SMBs in the sharing economy with liquidity issues. Demand is supposed to track the unemployment rate in the US. As it stands, it doesn't appear too rosy playing in the US midmarket. Competitors have already cited demand weaknesses.In terms of its penetration into new verticals, I view that as a game that requires some patience. The wins from the finance and the healthcare space are impressive. Last quarter includes brands like KeyBanc, Beth Israel Lahey Health, Dun and Bradstreet, and West Virginia United Health System. If the accounting solution becomes GA and procurement picks up as expected, Workday could enjoy the gains from the growth buffer it has been trying to create. However, I wouldn't bet on it as most large enterprises prefer to go for the best solution only after reviewing a lot of options given the availability of strong integration tools in the HCM space. This explains why Workday is focusing on the midmarket. Midmarket players tend to bundle HCM and financial planning offerings.On the cost side, I'm projecting gains in EPS as talent acquisition cost becomes cheap as the shrinking of the sharing economy creates a glut of sales and technical talents. This, in addition to the near-term R&D efficiency gains announced in the last CC, will put GAAP operating margin at -13% in FY'21. This represents a 100-basis point improvement from FY'20. This is an acceptable improvement when you consider the myriads of moving cost buckets in light of its recent acquisition and shifting go-to-market strategy.Management is expecting OCF (operating cash flow) growth of 25%, which suggests opex gains will flow to the net income line. Capitalization of new investments and growth in deferred revenue will keep more cash in the door. Growth in sales backlog (subscription revenue backlog @ $8.29 billion, guiding for low 20s to mid-teens growth in FY'21) suggests there should be no liquidity risk worries until 2022. Near-term capex spend includes $230m in real estate investments and an additional $350m on other capital needs. This will result in an FCF margin of +20%. That's not something to lose sleep over against the backdrop of its strong potential to drive average revenue per customer from its new offerings. This forms the second buffer to its valuation in addition to the revenue growth, which is expected to be in excess of 20%.The principal portion of its long-term debt isn't due until 2022. I will prefer to wait before worrying about EPS dilution if the debt is converted. I expect Workday to smoothen out its go-to-market strategy by the end of the year. As an investor, I can stomach a 2.5% dilution y/y as long as the cash is used to drive growth and margins.CompetitorsWorkday has strong products and capabilities to continue to acquire market share in the HCM space. However, Oracle and SAP are highly interested in acquiring more market share in the HCM space.Here is an excerpt from Oracle's last conference call:Oracle believes it has closed its usability gap. The usability gap has been a concern for analysts. Gartner also made comments about the improvement of the UI/UX of Oracle's HCM offering in its HCM report. Oracle's website also puts an emphasis on this. Gartner also talked about Oracle's strong PaaS capabilities (platform as a service). While it provides a tour of some of these capabilities on its website, it will be interesting to see demonstrations of use cases by customers. This will put more conviction in the minds of developers and IT architects.SAP is trying to improve the value of its offerings after the purchase of Qualtrics. Qualtrics is an employee experience platform similar to SurveyMonkey (SVMK) and Medallia (MDLA). Adding Qualtrics to its HCM offering is definitely a value boost. It will help HR teams drive more insights from their talent management modules. SAP highlights some of its PaaS capabilities on its website. It also provides insight into the adoption of these capabilities. Like Oracle, it has to continue to highlight compelling use cases from its HCM offering to drive interests from developers and CTOs.The low hanging fruit in the large enterprise space has been picked. This has pushed Workday into research mode. It appears Workday is less concerned about competition in the large enterprise space. Management is evolving its go-to-market strategy by expanding its capabilities into favorable verticals. Verticals like finance, procurement, and accounting integrate close to the HCM space and will drive average order value and retention rate.Other competitors include Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD), and Ceridian (CDAY). Management isn't really worried about them. Ceridian is considered a challenger, while CSOD is a niche player in Gartner's HCM quadrant. Both are regarded as having limited reach outside their home country.The merger of Ultimate Software and Kronos is something to watch out for. However, as we will explore in the macro section, Ultimate Software isn't much of a threat.MacroA spike in the unemployment rate means less monetization from current customers as the worries about global economic growth mean lower than expected growth in employees using HCM platforms.Besides that, Workday's international expansion strategy best explains its interesting evolution. Because Paylocity and Paycom have more strength/focus in the US mid-market, Workday is trying to play to its strength by focusing on its strong international momentum in the mid-market. This ensures it doesn't tickle sleeping dragons.Here is management's commentary about its international expansion strategy:Whenever Workday is having its sales conversations in the mid-market, it will be about selling the strength of its HCM platform, and its added capabilities in procurement, accounting, and analytics. It will mostly encounter players who don't have the robustness of its offerings. It's easier to get a CFO to listen to if you've got an HCM platform, a best of breed financial management offering, and an analytics module that blends both data from your platform and external solutions.Because Ultimate Software has a global reach, it will be going to those RFPs with its HCM offering and nothing more. Anaplan will only have its financial planning solution to offer. The same goes for SMAR and COUPA. I won't be quick to dismiss Anaplan given its recent popularity amongst GSPs who are adopting it for sales and financial planning when consulting with large enterprises. Also, Anaplan integrates with Workday's offerings, and I see it complementing Workday's offerings in special use cases.Oracle and SAP will contemplate sticking with large enterprises. It's not clear if they have a full awareness of what Workday is trying to do. SAP is trying to be more robust by convincing HR execs to bundle employee experience management solutions with its HCM offering. Gartner picked out a lot of customer experience and integration issues in its procure-to-pay and HCM magic quadrant when analyzing SAP. That's enough to keep SAP busy in the near term.Oracle remains the most formidable competitor because its financial management and HCM platform are integrated into its broader ERP solution. It also has a CX (business automation) offering to cross-sell. Ultimate and Kronos don't show up in the spend management/procure-to-pay space, which is where Workday appears to have left them behind.As Workday begins to plant those seeds in the mid-market, it will hope and pray Oracle doesn't notice. Management is already aware of this potential threat. Here is some excerpt from the last CC:In other to end the competition for good in the midmarket, Workday might decide to acquire some capabilities in customer/employee experience (SurveyMonkey most likely). That represents the next logical step. However, I don't see that happening until 2022, as management already has a lot of balls to juggle.Then again, it is clear that Workday will evolve from this battle unscathed and probably unnoticed until the final lap.Source: Author (using data from Google Finance)Investors aren't buying a lack of GAAP profitability situation. Neither are they buying Workday's move into the mid-market. The market also seems to be unimpressed by its expanding product portfolio. All these factors are weighing heavily on valuation. As a result, Workday's recovery from the COVID-19 induced sell-off wasn't as robust as some of its peers.Also, the last earnings call was in February, and the world was still in the early innings of the COVID-19 development. Given some of the bearish commentary from US-focused competitors like Paylocity and Paycom, that might explain why the full recovery never happened.Analysts appear to be less pessimistic, with an average price target of $175 and only a downgrade since April.

By the time it is done carving out its new territory, it will be too late to compete with it.Workday is a buy, and thanks for your time.If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to my name at the top of this article."
4351285,103480,2020-06-01T10:51:50-04:00,"Shares of Workday have soared more than 60% after hitting lows in mid-March.
        This is despite looming fundamental risks. Workday's recent Q1 results show decelerating revenues with the promise of more to come.
        Long-term reductions in corporate headcount, especially in the HR department, may lead additional complications for Workday's flagship HCM product.
        Its growth depends on its ability to lean on its finance/ERP products, but amid the pandemic, complex installs like this will be difficult to win.
        Workday shares are no longer terribly cheap, and are trading at ~9x forward revenues.","Workday (WDAY) has been through quite a roller coaster this year. Already pummeled late last year for its announcement that its flagship HCM cloud product would see substantial growth headwinds this year due to saturation, Workday got hit by a double-whammy when the coronavirus struck. The compounded weakness sent Workday to multi-year lows in mid-March.Yet Workday has also come roaring back quickly. The company just reported Q1 results, and despite several red flags in the company's messaging, the stock is back in positive territory for the year, while the S&P 500 remains down ~7%.Back in March, I championed Workday as a strong buy in the low $120s - but now, with shares having risen more than 60%, I'm backing off that recommendation. In my view, with the substantial risks to Workday's fundamental performance, the risk-reward profile is no longer in favor of bulls. Heading into this year, Workday itself acknowledged that HCM was going to run into growth issues. It's already simply too large and dominant as the premier HR cloud system, and the coronavirus only further pressures that - with HR being one of the first departments on the cost-cutting chopping block, and with overall employee counts going down via layoffs and voluntary buyouts (which the airlines just announced this week), it's going to be a disastrous year for HCM.Naturally, this makes Workday dependent on its finance/ERP business to generate growth. But ERPs are among the most complicated installs of all software programs, and these are the types of projects that will be getting delayed due to the coronavirus. The priority is to enable remote work; complex reworks of a company's financial reporting systems are not. In spite of the very real concerns facing Workday, shares are back to trading at a premium. At current share prices near $182, Workday has a market cap of $42.46 billion. After we net off the $2.60 billion of cash and $1.51 billion of debt on Workday's balance sheet, we're left with an enterprise value of $41.37 billion.Wall Street analysts are expecting consensus total revenue of $4.27 billion this year, representing just 16% y/y growth. Surprisingly, Workday has chosen to guide to full-year subscription revenues, a range that implies 19% y/y growth. Against the consensus view of total revenue, Workday is trading at a fairly rich 9.7x EV/FY20 revenues.To me, a company that's only expected to grow in the mid-teens amid substantial and specific fundamental pressure shouldn't be trading near a double-digit valuation multiple. Other companies in the ~20% growth range, by contrast, are trading the mid/high single digits. Workday may be compelling again when its valuation drops to ~8x forward revenues (a $150 price target), but I'd stay on the sidelines until then. Though I was previously bullish in March due to a mismatch between Workday's long-term potential and its then-valuation, Workday's current premium makes me update my stance to neutral. Wait and see for either a re-compression in Workday's valuation or signs of a fundamental turnaround.Let's now dive into the details of Workday's most recent results. The company's earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Workday 1Q21 earnings resultsSource: Workday 1Q21 earnings releaseRevenues grew 23% y/y to $1.02 billion, slightly beating Wall Street's expectations of $1.00 billion (+21% y/y). This decelerated only one point from last quarter's 24% y/y growth rate. Subscription revenues, meanwhile, saw slightly stronger 26% y/y growth - showing no deceleration at all. The big fear, however, is that the worst is yet to come. Chano Fernandez, Workday's president and head of its sales division, noted that while Workday's total pipeline remains healthy, sales cycles have lengthened as prospects delay their decisions - a sentiment echoed by many other software companies in the market. Per Fernandez's prepared remarks on the Q1 earnings call:This weakness is expected to weigh on Workday's second quarter, for which the company has guided to just 21% y/y subscription revenue growth - decelerating five points from the current quarter. CFO Robynne Sisco, meanwhile, noted that backlog growth, is only expected in the mid-to-high teens, which is a forward-looking indicator of further deceleration ahead. The basic takeaway from this: Workday was already in a soft demand environment pre-pandemic, but the lengthening of sales cycles and the postponement of complicated projects like ERP will weigh on the company even more.That being said, there are some positive notes coming from the company this quarter that prevent me from being fully bearish on Workday. While noting that the demand environment is ""fully fluid"" for the current year, Fernandez said that he believes all the delayed deals will simply be pushed out to the back half of the year, and that Workday hasn't had to discount its products any more than usual to drive sales.The company did register some weakness on the profitability front, however. Workday, unlike several software competitors under pressure, has not made the call to reduce its workforce or trim costs. In fact, in March, Workday announced it would give a cash bonus totaling two weeks' pay to all non-executive employees, costing the company $79 million in Q1. The company also onboarded 150 new employees in the quarter (for sizing purposes, total employees ended the quarter at roughly around ~12.4k). As a result, Workday's pro forma operating margins dipped 30bps to 12.8%, down from 13.1% in the year-ago Q1 - whereas in Q4, Workday had been able to slightly boost operating margins. The company's pro forma EPS of -$0.44, likewise, missed Wall Street's expectations of -$0.39.Again here, there's a bright side: Workday maintained strong positive free cash flows of $201.9 million in Q1 (a huge y/y increase of ~2x, but that's because Workday spent a lot on developing its owned real estate last year), and its ~$2.6 billion of cash is also supplemented by a fresh $1.5 billion credit facility that Workday executed in April to boost its liquidity. In my view, Workday doesn't have much upside trading at nearly 10x forward revenues. In the past, Workday was able to sustain revenue multiples in the low teens, but the business was growing at ~30% y/y back then and it didn't have substantial coronavirus-related risk facing it. This stock has become a wait-and-see: don't rush in to buy Workday just yet."
4349355,21798,2020-05-21T13:48:22-04:00,"Workday established a strong track record of customer satisfaction and growth.The stock is reasonably valued based on multiple years of growth.Although some uncertainties exist with the COVID-19 impact, Workday has an advantage as a cloud-based business and is poised to build on their above-average growth going forward.","Workday (WDAY) provides an extensive collection of cloud-based solutions for medium and large-sized businesses. The company's solutions cover most functions of managing a business. Workday's tools have the potential to make numerous details of financial and human resources management more efficient. This includes accounting, cash/asset management, compensation, benefits, billing, financial reporting, analytics, recruiting, talent management, time/expense tracking, and more.Despite the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 implications, Workday is set to achieve above-average growth for multiple years. The company is striving to continue its global growth. Since Workday's products consist of software, the business is able to run remotely during the COVID-19 shutdowns. Since Workday's solutions are for increasing the efficiency (lowers costs) of common business functions, most customers are likely to retain these services even if some are temporarily shut down.However, it is not clear how well the company will be able to add customers during this uncertain time. Perhaps, Workday can successfully sell the efficient cost-saving benefits of their solutions to some customers during this time and have the pace pick up after the lockdowns are lifted.Source The graphic above shows Workday's numerous solutionsWorkday did have a positive Q4 report for the fiscal year ending in January 2020. The company beat analysts' estimates for revenue and earnings for 14 consecutive quarters. Here are some highlights from the quarter. The following enterprise customers were added: 11 new Fortune 500 customers, 16 Global 2000 customers, 100 Prism Analytics customers, and 350 planning customers. Workday now has 45% of the Fortune 500 as customers, 60% of the Fortune 50 as customers, and 20% of the Global 2000 as customers.The company achieved double-digit revenue gains through global growth in Q4. Total revenue increased by 24% while revenue outside the U.S. increased by 33%. Business outside of the U.S. accounts for about 25% of Workday's total revenue. Subscription revenue increased 23% driven by strong renewals and new bookings.I realize that uncertainties exist for the business outlook for the current fiscal year as a result of COVID-19, but I wanted to provide a point of reference to show how well Workday was performing before the pandemic.We will get a better read on COVID-19's impact on the company in the next earnings report, scheduled on May 26, 2020. So far, analysts' EPS estimates for FY21 decreased by 4% from $2.19 to $2.10 over the past 3 months. That isn't too bad considering that companies that are more directly impacted by COVID-19 had estimates cut drastically (some from positive EPS to negative EPS). We'll have to hear what the company says in the next earnings report, but the nature of Workday's business should allow the company to hold up well.List of some of Workday's customersWorkday sees plenty of growth opportunities with medium-sized businesses on a global basis going forward. The company experienced solid growth in the following regions recently: Austria, Australia, Germany, New Zealand, and Switzerland. So, there is good potential to build on that positive momentum. The company is considering moving into the Mexican market in FY22.Medium-sized businesses are a large market in other countries. That's why Workday views targeting the medium-sized enterprise market as a good global growth opportunity.Workday was quick to move to cloud-based technology. Competitors, Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP) have been moving to the cloud at a slower pace. This probably contributed to Workday's positive growth momentum. Businesses can benefit from the following advantages of cloud services: lower information technology [IT] costs, flexibility, scalability, automatic updates, and data is secure as compared to being stored physically on site. Workday's cloud-based solutions can help the company build on the positive sales momentum, especially during the work-at-home environment.Verticalization is another area that Workday sees as a growth opportunity. The concept of verticalization is that a company can have specialized sales teams (experts) in each area of business. When this is applied to Workday, they can have HR experts, accounting experts, etc. that can better relate to the specific customer needs for each area of application.Verticalization has been found to cut costs for some companies who implemented it because the sales and delivery processes tend to be more productive. Plus, this concept tends to increase customer satisfaction since the sales team has a good understanding of the customers' needs.The graphic above illustrates the verticalization for financial institutions [FINS]At first glance, Workday looks extremely overvalued with a trailing P/E of 83 and a forward P/E of 74. However, I prefer to use the PEG ratio for high growth companies like this since it accounts for the company's 3 to 5 year expected earnings growth. Workday is trading with a PEG of 1.8, which is lower than the sector median PEG of 1.95.Workday's PEG ratio is in a fairly valued range (between one and two). This is typically a reasonable range for the high growth stocks that I've covered. These types of growth stocks tend to perform well with the PEG in this range. However, I would prefer the PEG to be at the lower end of the range (closer to one) for a more attractive valuation.Earnings are expected to grow between 11% and 12% for FY21 (ending in January). This accounts for the slightly lowered guidance that I mentioned earlier. The important thing to note is that Workday is expected to turn a profit this fiscal year. Revenue is expected to grow between 17% and 18% this year. This year's revenue growth expectation is lower than last year's growth of 28.2%. However, that is understandable given the environment that the economy is in right now.The stock is showing strength, but not yet overbought on the daily chart with the RSI at about 57. However, the money flow [CMF] has been weak recently with some whipsawing up and down.It doesn't look like a compelling time to buy yet. Although short-term traders might be able to catch a profit from this point until the stock gets overbought. It might be better to wait and see what the company says at the next earnings report on May 26. If the company gives pessimistic guidance, it could lead to a sell-off. So, a better entry point may occur as a result.Workday's outlook looks positive over the next 3 to 5 years. Sure, the company may face slower growth this year as compared to past and future years. The good news is that Workday is on track to turn a profit this fiscal year.Workday has the advantage of being a cloud-based business where most of the company's work can be done remotely. The company's solutions are structured to allow customers to use them remotely during the pandemic. Key business functions such as compensation, accounting, financial reporting, cash/asset management still need to be maintained during this time. Workday has proven solutions that enable customers to handle these functions regardless of how strong or weak the economy is.It would probably be best for potential investors to wait for the company's earnings report on May 26 to get a better assessment of the outlook for the rest of the year. Weak earnings guidance could create a better entry point for a long-term position."
4348734,102007,2020-05-19T13:15:59-04:00,"Workday provides essential HR and finance management software that is well-insulated from the current pandemic.The stock has been punished more than other software names, some of which are more exposed to consumers and small businesses.We think Workday is one of the more defensive names in the sector and recent share price weakness improved its risk/reward profile.","Workday (WDAY) is an enterprise software vendor that provides cloud-based solutions in human capital management, financial management, analytics, and other applications. While the company has underperformed in recent years relative to other faster-growth SaaS players, we do think the stability of its revenue base and high barrier to entry position the company extremely well heading into the pandemic. We also think that its resilience business and financial profile should be appreciated more by investors in times like this and could lead to premium valuation multiples in the near-term.Workday has a straightforward product portfolio and business model. The company sells subscriptions of its software and other services to companies in return for fees. However, what sets Workday apart from some of the other software vendors is the mission-critical nature of its products. Subscription revenue accounted for 85% of its fiscal 2020 revenue and these contracts are generally non-cancelable over terms of ~3 years. Most of its software is delivered on the cloud platform which makes Workday one of the most successful SaaS stories in the software space. The nature of HR and finance functions makes it perfect for a cloud solution and Workday has been able to achieve leading market shares in HR and a growing presence in financial management. The company estimated that its HR software holds a ~40% market share among Fortune 500 while other cloud vendors have another 25%, with the rest 35% representing non-cloud applications that could be pursued in the future. Globally, the company thinks that it only holds ~17% of the top 2000 competitions with much bigger whitespace to grow.(Source: IR Deck)HR continues to be the bread-and-butter for Workday as it accounted for ~81% of its subscription revenue while financial management accounted for the other 19%. Five years ago, HR accounted for more than 95% of the subscription revenue which demonstrated the success Workday has achieved in diversifying its revenue source over the years. Given the complementary nature of HR and finance functions, Workday has been pursuing a strategy of increasing its share of wallet among its customers. Every company needs an HR system and a financial management platform which makes it plausible for them to prefer a single vendor and uniform platform.(Source: IR Deck)Some of the SaaS players are facing more headwinds than Workday due to their exposure to the private sector and the non-essential nature of their products. For example, we think Intuit could be the most impacted due to their focus on consumer finance, tax filing, and small business applications, both of which are facing stress due to the pandemic. For Workday, the critical nature of its HR services insulates the company from economic cycles, absent a prolonged recession that resulted in a permanent reduction in customer base and employment. Its finance segment could be more impacted as it is a relatively smaller player in that field. However, the most likely scenario is a slowdown in growth as customers suspend implementation and purchases. We don't think the company's existing revenue base will be affected. Compare to other software vendors, we think Workday has one of the most defensive product portfolios and competitive positioning in the sector.Workday currently has a market cap of $41 billion and trades at an EV/2021 Sales of 7.6x, which is in-line with peers including Oracle (ORCL), Intuit (INTU), and Salesforce (CRM). The stock is cheaper than ServiceNow (NOW) and Adobe (ADBE) as the former has a superior growth rate and the latter has one of the best SaaS product offerings with strong growth history. We think Workday's valuation is appropriate at current levels but there could room for expansion if the company is able to demonstrate continued growth in the face of the pandemic and the accompanying economic damages.(Source: Filings and Bloomberg)Workday has underperformed most of its peers in 2020 so far as the stock declined 5.6% compared to a 6.5% gain for the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV). We don't think the underperformance is warranted given Workday's resilient product offerings and growth model. We expect the stock to rebound and track closer to its competitors in the near-term. Management stroke an optimistic tone when the company reported its fiscal 2020 full-year results on Feb 27, 2020, before the pandemic sparked strict restrictions from governments around the world. Given the relative underperformance, we think there is an opportunity for a short-term catch up for Workday shares in light of its resilient business model.(Source: Bloomberg)We believe Workday has one of the most defensive positionings in the enterprise software space. Compared to other high-growth software large-caps, Workday's main product in HR management is unlikely to be severely impacted by the downturn. Its finance software is also better insulated than other consumer-facing products. The shares have also underperformed its major peers by a wide margin in 2020 so far which is unfounded. We expect the shares to catch up in the near-term and the defensive nature of Workday to limit downside risk during this uncertain period."
4333664,103480,2020-03-23T12:21:40-04:00,"The broad coronavirus selloff has continued to punish an already beaten-down Workday stock, which has now lost nearly 50% from peaks reached last July.Though investors' concerns on Workday's HCM slowdown are valid, Workday is making up for slower growth with improving operating margins and cash flow.In FY20, Workday generated 43% y/y growth in operating cash flows.The company's steady stream of subscription revenues alongside an already-profitable operating model gives the company a massive bulwark in a difficult macroeconomic environment.Workday looks cheaply valued at just ~6.5x forward revenues. In the past, Workday used to trade at multiples in the low teens.","The broad market selloff we've endured since the beginning of the year has rendered many venerable brands across a multitude of industries on sale, and Workday (WDAY), one of the largest pure-play cloud companies in the software industry and the undisputed leader in human capital management (NASDAQ:HCM) technology, can now be considered a fire-sale stock. It's true that Workday's troubles began far before the coronavirus spread across the globe. Mid-last year, Workday announced that it expected growth rates in its flagship product, the HCM cloud, to see material deceleration. To most investors, this shouldn't have been ""new news"" - Workday has long been the #1 competitor in the HCM software space and like Salesforce with its flagship Sales Cloud, growth rates were eventually going to come down as the market opportunity became saturated. But even as Workday's revenue growth rates seem to have stabilized in the mid-20s over the past several quarters, the stock has seen no respite. Now trading back at levels not seen since 2017, Workday shares have peeled back ~45% off highs reached last July.Data by YChartsEvery stock has a price level below which investors won't be able to resist buying, especially if there are no red flags with the company's fundamentals. We should essentially think of Workday as a maturing software company that has traded growth for profitability. No, we can't expect Workday to keep growing at the ~30% rate of several years back - but as a tradeoff for lower growth, we've also gotten impressive improvement in margins and cash flow. In FY20, Workday managed to expand pro forma operating margins by 310bps, while operating cash flows grew faster than cash flow.These profitability gains - as well as the fact that Workday is nearly a pure-subscription company with a reliable stream of recurring revenues - should give investors a lot of comfort amid a bleak macroeconomic picture. In Workday, you're buying one of the flagship brands of the cloud software space at a fraction of its former worth.A quick valuation check on the stock - at current share prices near $125, Workday trades at a market cap of $29.00 billion. After netting off the $1.94 billion of cash and $1.26 billion of convertible debt on Workday's balance sheet, we're left with an enterprise value of $28.32 billion. Wall Street analysts are expecting consensus revenues of $4.35 billion for the current year, representing 20% y/y growth over FY20 revenues of $3.67 billion. Given that Workday's revenues just exited Q4 at a 24% y/y growth rate, we'd think that there may be a point or two of additional revenue upside to that consensus outlook - especially as Workday has taken steps in recent quarters to diversify its business beyond HCM and double down on its ERP capabilities through recent acquisitions like Adaptive Insights. Regardless, assuming this consensus 20% y/y growth viewpoint gives Workday a current valuation of just 6.5x EV/FY21 revenues. Data by YChartsIt's important to note that, for most of last year, Workday's valuation (orange line in the chart above) was mostly able to keep parity against ServiceNow (NOW) and Adobe (ADBE), both fellow large-cap SaaS companies with similar growth rates. Now, after the broad market pummeling, that valuation gap has vastly widened, with Workday trading at a four-turn discount to those peers. In my view, Workday is worth at least 9x EV/FY21 revenues, implying a price target of $172 and 37% upside from current levels. Buy now at Workday's trough valuation and hold on for a rebound.Let's now dive into Workday's fourth-quarter results in greater detail. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Workday 4Q20 earningsSource: Workday 4Q20 earnings releaseRevenues grew 24% y/y to $976.3 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $965.1 million (+22% y/y) by a solid two-point margin. As usual, Workday's subscription revenues saw stronger growth at 25% y/y, and comprised 86% of Workday's total revenue mix. As previously mentioned, the fact that Workday's revenue base is nearly purely subscription-based should offer a great deal of comfort that Workday is immune to the kinds of massive revenue declines that are expected in other industries, such as travel and hospitality. Buying into stable subscription companies like Workday can act as a great hedge to an extended economic shutdown scenario.And although global economies may currently be on pause, Workday is making up for saturation in its home market by expanding robustly overseas. Workday's international growth rates far eclipsed its overall revenue growth this quarter, with CFO Robynne Sisco commenting as follows on the Q4 earnings call:On a product basis, Workday's CEO Aneel Bhusri commented that demand was healthy ""across all product areas."" Even HCM, as large as it is, managed to sign on 11 new Fortune 500 companies in the quarter, a signal that perhaps growth in this category isn't as capped as pessimistic investors would believe. What we find more impressive about Workday, however, is the fact that the company has transitioned its focus into profitability. Aside from the three-point improvement in full-year pro forma operating margins that we mentioned earlier, one strong highlight is Workday's 43% y/y growth in operating cash flows in FY20:Figure 2. Workday OCF trendsSource: Workday 4Q20 earnings releaseFor the full year, Workday boasted a robust 23.2% OCF margin - a clear distinguisher in an enterprise SaaS sector that is full of cash-burning companies. The fact that Workday can reliably generate strong cash flow growth and has a balance sheet with ~$2 billion in cash and only convertible debt (which is far more patient than standard debt on principal repayment) indicates that Workday is sufficiently well-capitalized to endure even an extended recession in which capital markets access may be limited. Workday is a top-shelf brand in the software sector that is currently suffering a fire sale. Despite substantial evidence that the company's steady recurring revenues and strong balance sheet give Workday plenty of ammunition against macroeconomic challenges, shares of Workday have continued a brutal sell-off to true bargain basement levels. Though the entire sector has seen valuation multiples fall, the fact that Workday's valuation gap versus peers like ServiceNow and Adobe that it used to closely follow suggests that Workday has far more rebound opportunity when market sentiment improves.Stake out a buy point here and wait patiently for a bounce back."
4332751,69905,2020-03-18T11:56:35-04:00,Markets have been bruised. There are now awesome investment opportunities all around us. Workday is not one of these great opportunities.Workday's guidance is pointing towards rapidly decelerating revenue growth rates. Guidance issued before coronavirus implications were widely understood.This stock is best avoided.,"Workday (WDAY) may have at one point had a valid bullish thesis because it was rapidly growing, it had strong visibility and a highly predictable revenue stream that in an overvalued stock market may have made sense, at the time. Having said that, it did not make sense to me as I felt the stock was overvalued.But now, with so many awesome investment opportunities, it is truly not worthwhile investing in something that is still overvalued, despite the recent sell-off. Here's why:Briefly, Workday's Professional Services segment includes consulting fees for deployment and training. The idea is that these Professional Services are essentially 'hand-holding' fees to ensure that customers understand and are able to satisfactorily use Workday's platforms.Furthermore, over time there is an expectation that Workday's Professional Services should decrease relative to total revenue.Professional Services are one-off services, and if customers were too dependent on Workday's consulting service, it would imply that the platform is not user friendly.In reality, we can clearly see that over time, Workday's Professional Services segment is decreasing as part of total revenue -- this is expected. Professional Services currently account for just under 15% of total revenue in fiscal 2020 and are expected to remain similar in fiscal 2021. Further down the road into fiscal 2022, I would expect it to account for roughly 12% (by my own rough estimates).Similarly, while Workday does not guide for total revenue, we can add 15% to next year's subscription revenues to get an estimate for total revenue for next year:Source: author's calculations; ***author's guidance (see text)Without attempting to sound like a bear -- particularly because I'm an optimist and there are already too many bears around (!) -- but fiscal 2021 is pointing towards a substantial deceleration in revenue growth rate.In fact, the deceleration is so pronounced that I doubted myself so many times and double-checked myself. Furthermore, as a sanity check, I looked up analysts estimates and you can see there is no difference to my own estimates:Source: SA pageI could not believe from the Q&A section of the call that the sell-side remained so exuberant with Workday's performance. Consequently, I went back to check Workday's backlog revenue rates for the previous year:Source: Fiscal 2019 Press StatementSource: Fiscal 2020 Press StatementAgain, we can see that year-over-year there is a marked deceleration of more than 7% in its backlog revenue.Hence, whichever we appraise this situation, Workday is aiming for a rapid slowdown in revenue growth rates.Even without factoring in any impact from coronavirus, as Workday posted this guidance on the 27th of February, and as you know the past two weeks a lot has changed in the world (I never thought I would say that and it actually mean it), but investors are left with an overvalued company with rapidly declining growth rates.On the call, Workday's CFO Robynne Sisco noted how Workday had entered fiscal 2021 with 'considerable momentum' and that Q4 2021 would have tough comparisons with Q4 2020.Accordingly, investors have been paying a large premium for what was supposedly a fast-growth company, with very stable revenue growth rates.However, it transpires that not only is Workday rapidly slowing down, but its subscription business model is not showing the stability investors were hoping it would.Presently, investors are still paying close to 8 times trailing sales for a company that is hugely GAAP unprofitable with declining (and in my opinion) unsustainable growth rates.Workday is a hugely popular stock and investors are paying a large premium to participate in its rapid growth.However, even without coronavirus impacting its guidance too aggressively, the company's sustainable and recurring revenues are not as enticing as we were being led to believe. Sidestep this investment."
4330576,20521,2020-03-09T07:57:52-04:00,"For the quarter, Workday revenues grew 24% over the year to $976.3 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $964.5 million.For the first quarter, Workday expects subscription revenues of $873-875 million and professional services revenues at $137 million.One of the key levers for growth that Workday has been using is its PaaS strategy.","According to a recent Research and Markets report, the global SaaS market is estimated at 13% CAGR to $220.21 billion by 2022 from $134.44 billion in 2018. SaaS-based financial and human resources enterprise services provider Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) recently reported its fourth-quarter results that continued to benefit from this growth.For the quarter, Workday revenues grew 24% over the year to $976.3 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $964.5 million. Adjusted earnings grew 22% over the year to $0.50 per share and were also ahead of the market's forecast of $0.40 per share.By segment, Subscription services revenues grew 25% to $840 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $830 million. Professional services revenues grew 18% over the year to $136.6 million.Workday ended the year with revenues growing 28.5% to $3.63 billion, driven by 30% growth in subscription revenues. Net loss was $2.12 per share. On an adjusted basis, net income was $1.88 per share compared with $1.36 last year.For the first quarter, Workday expects subscription revenues of $873-875 million and professional services revenues at $137 million. It expects to end 2020 with revenues of $3.755-3.770 billion. The market was looking for revenues of $1 billion and EPS of $0.49 for the quarter and revenues of $4.35 billion with an EPS of $2.17 for the year.Over the past few quarters, Workday has been focusing on growth through diversifying beyond the traditional HCM market into other enterprise services such as financial management and procure-to-pay. The results of the push can be seen in the number of customers that Workday continues to grow each quarter. Last quarter, it ended with over 3,200 customers. Within the HCM space, 45% of its customers were Fortune 500 players. It added names like KeyBanc, Beth Israel Lahey Health, Dun & Bradstreet, and West Virginia United Health System for its financial software solution.One of the key levers for growth that Workday has been using is its PaaS strategy. Workday opened its platform to third-party developers in 2018. It provided developers access to its platform so that organizations could leverage Workday's data models and use custom apps and extensions from Workday.Today, Workday's platform provides third-party apps that integrate into its HCM, Financials, Learning, and the Adaptive Insights tools. Workday has its own Product Management Team that builds integrations to services such as Adobe Sign, ADP Check Printing, ADP Tax Filing and several other services. It also runs a Software Partner Program that has been set up to provide third-party solution providers with the ability to build a knowledge foundation with Workday from a Business Interaction and Technical perspective.Its Partners can engage extensively with Workday's joint-customers to help identify and focus on the core use cases that can help drive value from combined solutions and deliver higher process efficiencies. Within payroll processing alone, for instance, Workday's partners have built integrations to process payroll in more than 40 countries.While Workday realizes the importance of the developers on its platform, it does not disclose detailed statistics about this high growth area. Workday is surely following the PaaS strategy that all SaaS companies need, but given the importance of the segment, it should start disclosing more details about its PaaS initiative.Its stock is trading at $172.89 with a market capitalization of $39.76 billion. It hit a 52-week high of $226.83 in July last year and a 52-week low of $151.06 in October last year.Original postEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4329845,21815,2020-03-05T09:10:27-05:00,"Workday is market-leading in cloud HCM software, with 45% of the Fortune 500 as clients.It has successfully expanded into financials, planning, and analytics, which keeps growth in the mid-20s, and there are still plenty of opportunities, especially internationally.However, given the high level of stock-based compensation and related dilution, the company isn't profitable on a GAAP basis, and its GAAP EPS is actually trending down.There isn't much operational leverage yet, so we feel investors need a fairly long time horizon.","Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) has been an amazing company. In a short few years, it has established itself as the leading HCM (human capital management) cloud application, and it's now seemingly on course to repeat this with their financial management applications, taking on competition from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and German SAP (NYSE:SAP). Investors, of course, have noticed:It's no surprise that the stock price has retreated recently in the market mayhem, and with companies like Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) warning about the impact of the coronavirus on their expected results, even if management argued during their FY2020 Q4CC that they hadn't experienced any impact from that.Data by YChartsInvestors should be aware of both the ongoing revenue growth, nearly five-folding the size of the company in 5 years as well as the continuing GAAP deterioration, which, at first sight, is pretty shocking at nearly half a billion in GAAP losses the last year.The non-GAAP figures are much better. Take, for instance, operating profit in Q4:There are three questions here:The answer to the first question is simple:Data by YChartsThat is, share-based compensation is 23.7% of revenue. This is, of course, not free for investors:Data by YChartsAs to the second question, about the trend:Data by YChartsIt is at least moving in the right direction, although basically stalling since 2018. With respect to cash:Data by YChartsUnsurprisingly, the massive stock-based compensation is responsible for the positive cash flow. Without it, free cash flow would actually be negative. We think this is one reason the shares have lagged the S&P 1500 Application Software Index (10-K):Like other SaaS business application companies, there are numerous ways which Workday can grow:Not all of these are equally relevant, but we'll comment on the most important ones for the company. We know that one in four clients has both HCM and the Financial suite, and that's about it.Their killer app is, of course, HCM, where the company now has a leading position (Q4CC):One might, with 45% of Fortune 500 and 60% of Fortune 50 companies as customers, think that growth opportunities are dwindling here, but this would be the wrong conclusion. HCM has two further growth avenues:Medium enterprise is the company's biggest longer-term opportunity for HCM to keep growth going. It's a segment where the company offers a lower cost solution with significant opportunities especially overseas, so combining this segment with international growth.Internationally, there are still many greenfield opportunities as only a quarter of revenues come from abroad (10-K):Over the past several years, the company has introduced a host of new products (either developed internally or acquired), like Financial Management, Planning and Prism Analytics, as well as custom solutions for specific verticals (like education, professional services, healthcare).Of these, Financial Management is the most established and enjoyed a strong quarter, as well as their other newer solutions (Q4CC):The latter (Scout RFP) has just recently been acquired. Still in beta is its cloud platform, which (10-K) ""is designed to allow customers to extend Workday's core applications, enabling customers to address unique business or industry use cases. The platform includes tools for building, deploying and serving extension applications from within the Workday cloud.""This could open a path to a marketplace for third-party add-ons, but we're not aware of this being in the works. The more product lines there are, the more the company can cross-sell to existing clients, and while this is happening, data is scarce.Management argues that CFOs are looking at planning and transactions applications together and want a unified system This is what Workday can offer, so there are likely to be cross-selling opportunities here as well.Like most business SaaS companies, the company also sells quite a bit of professional services, helping customers with implementation (10-K):But the margin on these professional services is actually negative on a GAAP basis:This is, of course, not unusual, and professional services aren't a profit center but exist to smooth customer adoption, so at least, part of their benefits are not captured by a narrow profit/loss view.The company does have an ecosystem of partners, from the 10-K:But we didn't come across figures that indicate what percentage of business they bring in and/or facilitate and how that is evolving, and according to the same 10-K, their direct sales force is their primary channel.Revenue grew 24% with subscription revenue at 25% growth. The company doesn't break down revenues according to product line (just the distinction between subscription and professional services).Non-GAAP EPS came in considerably ($0.10) better at $0.50, and revenue beat by $11.2M at $976.3M. Despite the beat in revenue, the law of large numbers is asserting itself as the growth rate is gliding downwards (despite a number of acquisitions):Data by YChartsOn the basis of the good Q4 results, management has raised FY2021 (which started last February) guidance a tad with FY21 subscription revenue now at $3.755-3.77B from the prior $3.73B. Management expects operating cash flow in FY21 to be approximately $1.08B (+25%).CapEx will be $230M for real estate investments and an additional $350M to support other capital needs.Data by YChartsAnalysts expect non-GAAP EPS to come in at $2.23 this (fiscal) year, rising to $2.81 next year, so on an earnings basis, the shares are really quite expensive.Given the dilution as a result of share-based compensation, we feel that non-GAAP EPS doesn't tell the whole story, and indeed, GAAP loss per share is actually trending mildly downwards.Data by YChartsOne might also want to keep in mind that the company actually has over $1B in long-term debt (convertible notes), although this is more than covered by the $1.94B in cash and equivalents.Despite being a market leader and having reached a level of maturity especially in its core HCM market, the company isn't actually all that profitable. In fact, without copious amounts of share-based compensation, the company isn't profitable at all, not even cash flow positive.While we recognize the core competitive strength of the company and would normally not hesitate to put a buy rating on the stock, the large share-based compensation and resulting dilution and minimal operational leverage sort of sticks in our throat a bit.As we know from the likes of Nutanix and Microsoft, even business software companies aren't necessarily immune to the economic effects of the coronavirus outbreak, so we stay on the sidelines with this one, at least until the dust settles."
4318435,35181,2020-01-22T17:47:11-05:00,"Stock price has fallen significantly the last 6 months and is now showing signs of life.The company has strong revenue growth and should have ~30% growth in the near future.I believe that, unlike 6 months ago, this stock is now fairly valued.I'm raising my rating from neutral to very bullish.","In my previous article on Workday, Inc. (WDAY) entitled ""Workday: Great Company, But I Think I'll Wait"", I made the following statement:(Source: Seeking Alpha article: ""Workday: Great Company, But I Think I', Wait""That was 6 months ago, and the stock price has dropped almost 20% since then. The sentiment towards SaaS companies has shifted from bearish to bullish, and Workday stock appears to be coming back to life as it penetrates local resistance.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)Revenue growth and free cash flow margin still appear to be strong. Therefore, I am raising my rating from neutral to very bullish in order to fully capitalize on the currently very bullish market for software stocks.When it comes to software companies, I don't rely on traditional value factors; instead, I focus on other measures, such as the software company ""Rule of 40"" and relative valuation, a concept that I recently developed that compares forward sales multiple versus estimated sales growth.Workday's annual sales growth rate is 31.5%, down from the 5-year growth rate of 43%, a rate that would be very hard to sustain.(Source: Portfolio123)Workday's free cash flow margin TTM is a decent 12.4%. The free cash flow margin has been fairly flat since mid-2015.(Source: Portfolio123)One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40 - some analysts use EBITDA and others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin TTM.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the software company has growth and cash flow in balance and is considered financially healthy. In Workday's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 31.5% + 12.4% = 43.9%The calculation comes out higher than 40%, indicating that Workday has a healthy balance between growth and profits.I determine stock valuation on a relative basis by comparing sales multiples and sales growth to the company's peers. I believe that high-growth companies should be more highly valued than slow-growth companies. After all, growth is a prime factor in valuation models such as DCF. Higher future growth results in higher valuation and, therefore, higher EV/sales multiple.To illustrate this point, I created a scatter plot of enterprise value/forward sales versus estimated Y-o-Y sales growth for the 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The sales multiple in the vertical direction is calculated using the EV and ""next year's sales estimate"" mean value based on all analysts from the Portfolio123 database. The estimated Y-o-Y sales growth is calculated using ""current year's sales estimate"" and ""next year's sales estimate,"" also provided by Portfolio123.As can be seen from this scatter plot, Workday is very slightly above the best-fit line, suggesting that its forward sales multiple is modestly higher than its peers, given its estimated future revenue growth rate. My interpretation is that Workday is modestly overvalued relative to the typical stock in my digital transformation universe, based on Sales/EV multiple.The Sales/EV multiple tells me that the stock is slightly overvalued, but my value assessment changes when I substitute next year's earnings estimates for forward sales.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)The results shown on this second scatter plot suggest that Workday is fairly valued based on next year's earnings estimates. Therefore, I have to conclude that Workday is fairly valued so long as the company maintains the earnings estimated for next year.While software stock valuations have come down in recent months, they are still high on a historical basis. Uncertainties, such as the rising tension in the Middle East, trade disputes and President Trump's impeachment, could cause a market downturn. Software stocks tend to get hit hard during any market turbulence.Workday has set a high bar in terms of revenue growth and free cash flow. Failure to match historical growth assuming a small amount of deceleration would likely result in a lower stock price.Workday appears to have a very strong future and will possibly be one of the five stocks that will dominate the modern tech stack, the others being Salesforce (CRM), Adobe (ADBE), ServiceNow (NOW), and Microsoft (MSFT) (Office 365) potentially being one of the last companies standing in the race towards the digital workplace.The company is a leader in two industries, HCM and Financial Management, both of which still have a relatively low level of penetration.(Source: Workday financial analyst day 2018)The company has YoY revenue growth of 31% and is likely to achieve similar growth for several years based on a high level of customer satisfaction, outsized R&D investments, and international expansion. The company fulfills the Rule of 40, a rule of thumb that estimates a software company's health. In my estimation, Workday is fairly valued. Given the bullish move in the stock and software market, in general, I am raising my rating from neutral to very bullish."
4311666,101801,2019-12-10T13:25:53-05:00,"Today, we take a look at workforce management software solutions provider Workday.The stock is down significantly from recent highs as revenue growth slows. The equity has just seen its first insider buy in a very long time, however.We take a quick look at this tech stock, recent insider activity, and third quarter results in the paragraphs below.","- H.L. MenckenToday, we explore a previously high flying tech stock named Workday (WDAY). The stock is down some 25% from recent highs even though the company recently posted a slight Q3 beat. Workday has also just seen the first insider purchases in its shares I can find on record. We take a look at recent events at Workday, the insider purchases as well as its current valuation levels in the paragraphs below.Workday is based just outside of San Francisco and provides enterprise cloud applications worldwide. Its applications help its customers to manage critical business functions and optimize their financial and human capital resources. Even with the recent decline in the stock, the shares sport a market capitalization near $38 billion at current trading levels.Insider Buying:A director bought just over $1.6 million in shares on December 5th. This is the first insider buying I can find in the stock since the company came public in 2012. However, due to hundreds of sell in the stock over the past two years, I can only see back to early 2018 on InsiderCow.Third Quarter Results:Earlier this month, the company posted third quarter results that beat both top- and bottom-line expectations. Non-GAAP earnings rose to 51 cents a share, 13 cents a share above the consensus. Total revenues rose over 26% on a year-over-year basis to nearly $940 million, more than $15 million above expectations.Subscription revenue was $798.5 million, an increase of 27.9% from the same period last year. The company also ever so slightly raised FY2019 full-year guidance. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $258 million compared to $114.3 million in the third quarter of last year.However, the company now expects subscription growth of 21% in FY2020 to just under $3.1 billion. While that was a tad above previous guidance, it was significantly under the roughly 23.5% growth of the consensus analyst forecast. The company also recently completed the $540 purchase of Scout RFP this week.These results continued to make Workday a major battleground stock. Since Q3 results posted, eight analysts firms including Oppenheimer and RBC Capital have reiterated Buy ratings. William Blair initiated WDAY as a new Buy this morning. Price targets proffered among the optimists range from $210 to $262 a share.In contrast, seven analyst firms including Piper Jaffray and Barclays reissued Hold ratings after quarterly earnings last week. Compass Point downgraded the shares to a Hold. Price targets among the pessimists range from $170 to $200 a share.The company ended the third quarter with $2.1 billion in cash and just over $1.5 billion in debt obligations on its balance sheet.Valuation:Workday, even with the recent decline, is still not cheap using traditionally valuation metrics. The stock trades for over 35 times operating cash flow, over ten times this year's revenues and nearly 100 times FY2019's profits.Usually, the first substantial insider buy in a very long time after a significant decline in a stock can signal the shares have become undervalued. However, it is hard to argue that given Workday's still significant valuation.In addition, as a recent article argued, the company's revenue growth is on a longer term downward trend. That seems to be continuing. Subscription growth in the third quarter was nearly 28%, but the company is projecting only 21% growth in FY2020.Finally, while the insider purchase is significant in itself. It is drown out by the myriad insider sells in this name. On the same day, this director was adding over $1.6 million to his holdings, the company's CEO was unloading over $8 million of his shares. Given that, I would still be avoiding Workday despite this one insider's purchases.- H.L.

4308051,69905,2019-11-20T12:50:54-05:00,"Upcoming Q3 2020 results are likely to offer a negative surprise to investors.Unprofitable enterprise, with unimpressive non-GAAP operating margins.Why investors should avoid this stock.","Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) typifies a high-flying stock towards the end of a bull market.Driven by plenty of bullish rhetoric, while backed by heavy losses and an overvalued stock.I demonstrate that its revenues rates are slowing down, but its valuation remains fully extended.Ultimately, readers would do well to avoid this stock.The graph below notes that Workday's revenues are decidedly slowing down.Source: author's calculation, *analysts estimatesWorkday's Q3 2020 results are just around the corner, and as you can see above, Q3 2020 revenues are expected to have grown by less than 30% year over year.Even if Workday beats consensus, investors will start to question just how sustainably are Workday's revenues growing at? Realistically, it now appears to be growing in the sub 30% region.Moreover, underneath its decelerating revenue rates are items that point towards its fundamental troubles.Here is Workday's recent investor day:Can you spot the difference between the two red boxes? The one below is Workday's version of profitability; meanwhile, the one above is Workday's actual GAAP profitability.Of course, as you know, the reason for the discrepancy is predominantly being driven by Workday's stock-based compensation, which steadfast bulls dismiss as inconsequential.However, even while pushing aside this contentious issue, isn't it at least interesting to ponder that, for an 'asset-light enterprise', Workday's non-GAAP profit margins are actually fairly slim?The graph below notes the difference between Workday's 'strong' cash flows and its actual free cash flows.Source: author's calculationsWhile the blue columns are Workday's cash flows from operations, the red columns adjust for Workday's significant 'real estate projects' and capex requirements.Readers should note that I have not adjusted for Workday's recurring 'business combinations (aka: regular acquisitions) or Workday's capitalization of intangibles.To be fair, Workday's balance sheet is strong, with approximately $2 billion of cash and equivalents. Having said that, Workday has its upcoming 2020 convertible notes. However, this only amounts to approximately $250 million and will cause no significant restriction to the company's operations.Source: author's calculationsThe table above illustrates that Workday trade at a high P/Sales (11.4x), as well as trading at a high P/Cash Flows from operations (54.9x).Of course, the usual rhetoric from shareholders is that investors seeking to participate in a rapidly growing enterprise have to pay up for quality. In other words:The problem, though, is that Workday is not a wonderful company. Not only is it severely GAAP unprofitable but also offers terrible returns on invested capital. And the nail in the coffin here is really that it's 'stable and recurring' growth rates are actually rapidly showing signs of slowing down.Astute shareholders that follow this sector closely will no doubt have noticed that investors are starting to become more discerning of which cloud company will have the most staying power, as the sector has had to embrace a proliferation of cloud-operators.At this junction, readers have two options on the table:"
4310496,103480,2019-12-04T12:26:04-05:00,"Shares of Workday slid ~6% after reporting Q3 results.Though Workday beat expectations in Q3 and guided above consensus for Q4, the company's preliminary outlook for FY21 startled investors.Citing maturation of its core HCM product (which isn't new news), Workday is guiding to 21% y/y subscription revenue growth in FY21, two points below consensus of 23% y/y.Workday's valuation in the ~$150-160 range, at ~8x forward revenues, is compelling and betrays its huge TAM and profit growth.","The article was also shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more about PRO+ here.For yet another quarter, cloud software giant Workday (WDAY) has continued to linger in the penalty box. Recall that in October, Workday was the primary catalyst behind a sweeping, sector-wide correction in software stocks when it announced that its core human capital management (HCM) product was reaching maturity and would experience near-term deceleration. This isn't ""new news"", but after Workday released its preliminary outlook for FY21 on its third-quarter earnings call, investors essentially reacted to the same news and sent shares downward another ~6%:Data by YChartsIn my view, Workday is a perfect ""buy the dip"" opportunity. Shares have lost ~30% since their mid-summer peaks above $230, yet I find that the quality of the business hasn't wavered in the least. All large software companies see maturation in their core products - Salesforce.com (CRM), as one prime example, only sees low-teens growth in its core Sales Cloud product. As I wrote in a previous article, Workday has already taken steps to diversify its business beyond HCM - especially with the addition of entirely new categories of software like Adaptive Insights, which puts Workday head-to-head against the likes of Anaplan (NYSE:PLAN) in the enterprise planning space.To be specific about the guidance that investors are begrudging: during her prepared remarks on the Q3 earnings call, CFO Robynne Sisco offered the following commentary:Analysts, on the other hand, were hoping for 23% y/y subscription growth. But as we've seen in the past with Workday, the company often offers reasonable targets that it can eventually beat - especially when it's guiding further out than a single quarter. Even some analysts believe Workday's guidance tends toward the conservative side.A slowdown in growth is natural as Workday approaches a ~$4 billion annualized subscription run rate. What investors should focus on at this time is the fact that Workday is making use of its growth consolidation to hammer down profits - as we'll discuss shortly in Workday's most recent results, operating margins have shot through the roof. During turbulent market times when investors have seemed to shy away from high-flying growth stocks and into more value-oriented names, I find this profit growth to be compelling enough to paper over Workday's slight deceleration expectations.At present levels around $163, Workday stock trades at a market cap of $37.66 billion. After netting out the $2.10 billion of cash and $1.25 billion of convertible debt on Workday's balance sheet, the company has an enterprise value of $36.81 billion. For FY21, Wall Street analysts are expecting total revenues of $4.41 billion, per Yahoo Finance. This puts Workday's current valuation at just 8.3x EV/FY21 revenues - bearing in mind that the company has historically traded at valuation multiples in the low teens, I find Workday's current share price to be quite a steal.Here's how that valuation multiple stacks up against other major SaaS large-caps:Data by YChartsHistorically, Workday has traded at a slight premium to Salesforce (whose growth tends to trail a few points behind Workday); now, that gap has more or less converged. This leads me to believe there's at least one or two turns of multiple expansion available to Workday. My price target on the stock is $196, representing a 10x EV/FY21 revenue multiple and 19% upside from current levels.Amid the fuss over Workday's preliminary FY21 guidance, it's also important to recognize that Workday blew results out of the ballpark in Q3. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Workday 3Q20 resultsSource: Workday Q3 earnings releaseRevenues grew 26% y/y to $938.1 million, surpassing Wall Street expectations of $920.6 million (+24% y/y) by a considerable two-point margin. Subscription revenue growth of 28% y/y also grew slightly faster than overall revenue growth.And despite widespread concerns of deceleration, Workday notes that it continues to gain market share in the HCM space. Per CEO Aneel Bhusri's earnings call commentary:The company has also put a lot of recent R&D focus into its Financials suite, where it's building out new spend management and procurement tools to flesh out its capabilities in that space.What's perhaps most important to highlight in Workday's Q3 results, however, is the incredible leap in profit margins that it was able to deliver. Workday's pro forma operating margins in Q3 clocked in at 15.2%, 850bps better than 3Q19 at just 6.7%. As Workday's revenue growth as slowed down, it has managed to rein in operating efficiencies - particularly on the sales and marketing front, which for Workday (as for most other SaaS companies) is one of the largest drivers of spend. Note as well that Workday has a long-term operating margin target of 25%, so there's still plenty of headroom to go on the profitability side.Note as well that Workday's pro forma EPS of $0.53 absolutely crushed Wall Street's expectations of $0.37 with 43% upside. The company also more than doubled operating cash flow in the quarter to $258.3 million, while year-to-date OCF has grown 59% y/y:Figure 2. Workday cash flowsSource: Workday Q3 earnings releaseAs usual, investors are overreacting to Workday's early view of its FY21 results, which some analysts have already billed as conservative. Workday's expected deceleration in HCM is a normal milestone in its growth trajectory, which will be supplanted by growth in Financials and other growth initiatives. With >$2 billion of cash on hand, Workday also has the flexibility to drive another category-expanding acquisition like Adaptive Insights in the near future. At the same time, the company is also hugely expanding its bottom-line potential - at a critical time in the markets when tech investors have begun putting more weight on profitability. Trading at just ~8x forward revenues, far below historical multiples, investors have a well-timed opportunity to get in on Workday at the ground floor."
4297724,105354,2019-10-21T19:51:50-04:00,"Workday announced new SKUs that will be introduced in the market in FY 2020.Demand in the cloud/SaaS space remains healthy.WDAY identified four growth levers for them to post double-digit top-line figures.I believe fair value lies at $185.6 per share, 20% higher than current levels.","Workday's (NASDAQ:WDAY) latest analyst day inspired confidence in the company’s multi-year growth potential, driven by its strong cloud product portfolio and product pipeline, underpinned by its market leadership in the various business segments it operates in. Consequently, Workday looks well-positioned to reach to the upper echelon of the software industry. Projecting revenue growth of 20% over the next couple of years and applying a 9.6X EV/Sales industry multiple, I estimate fair value of WDAY shares at $185.6 per share, representing an upside of 20% from current price levels. Thus, I believe shares presently offer an attractive entry point for a growing company in the cloud industry.At its recent analyst day (""Workday Rising"") that hosted more than 14K attendees, Workday directed its attention to production innovations, the continued incorporation of new technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and blockchain to automate processes ranging from recruitment to accounting. It also highlighted the importance of WDAY’s unified platform, which is expected to roll out in 1H 2020.In the Human Capital Management (HCM) business segment, the company provided an update on its talent optimization tools, namely ""Skills Insights"" and ""Talent Marketplace,"" both of which provide employers the means to acquire deeper insights into employees’ skillsets, while also allowing employees to better optimize career opportunities within the workplace, and consequently enhance retention rates. Further, the company also discussed its Workday People Analytics and Discovery Boards, which utilize augmented analytics to visualize data and clarify the drivers of critical business trends. Moreover, Workday Credentials and Wayto by Workday will also remove frictions related to the issuance, management, and verification of credentials.Meanwhile, WDAY also showcased "" Workday Accounting Center"" and ""Plan to Execute"" tools which streamline and automate the accounting process. Management disclosed new features that will automate key accounting processes, including supplier invoice automation and anomaly detection. ""Plan to Execute,"" a new planning tool, will be available to clients using Adaptive Insights and Workday Financial Management. This product gives users the ability to better visualize their budget plans, compare the variance between spending and plan, and monitor spending effectively.Also, management highlighted the importance of the ""Workday Cloud Platform"" which extends existing offerings and provides unique value to customers to build applications for themselves. At present, the platform has 79 customers with 59 live apps. The product will be available in 1H 2020, but this might drive meaningful growth within the next few years.In total, the company announced nine new SKUs that will be introduced to the market in FY 2020. A positive takeaway is that these product announcements reflect WDAY’s thrust to continue to out-innovate the competition. Based on estimates, the company invests around 30% of revenues in R&D, more than the 23% of revenues on R&D spend of SaaS companies. Over time, this should create considerable competitive advantages for WDAY over its peers.Workday also remains a market leader in the Human Capital Management space with features and functionalities ahead of other SaaS HCM offerings. In particular, WDAY’s ability to innovate and deliver new features allows it to respond to customer demand and improve customer retention.Its financial segment is also gaining momentum, supported by the easing of cloud security concerns and maturing cloud offerings. It was noted that Workday has managed to narrow the feature functionality gap and has seen some standalone wins in the space, building a relatively stronger presence in financial services and healthcare.Notably, the primary driver of the shift to the cloud is mainly customers' inclinations to adopt more modern technology as customers are increasingly looking at tools that will enhance their operating processes beyond cost savings. This trend favors vendors like Workday over legacy solutions in the market, such as SAP and ADP. However, replacing older systems that are embedded in a company’s process can take more than a year – a hindrance that could delay potential deals.Overall, demand trends are strong, with WDAY well-positioned to capitalize in the long run.WDAY also outlined the following drivers for sustained growth in the coming years:WDAY is guided to post double-digit gains on its top line, driven by the growth levers outlined above, i.e., continued share gains in the HCM North America business, international expansion, market penetration within financials, and the release of new products and innovations. Assuming these initiatives gain traction, I believe revenues can hit $3.59 billion in FY 2020 (+27% YoY) and $4.32 billion in FY 2021 (+20% YoY), Meanwhile, net profits should reach $413 million in FY 2020 and $530 million in FY 2021, with net margins increasing from 11.5% to 12.2% for the same period. The projected margin expansion is based on the shift in product mix as guided, along with benefits from upcoming growth initiatives and R&D efforts.Thus, I believe the fair value for WDAY lies at $185.6 per share using a 9.6X EV/Sales Industry Multiple of similar SaaS companies, though macroeconomic uncertainties are a risk to potential deals, and could ultimately impact the realization of top-line projections. Notwithstanding this risk, the company’s continued efforts on product innovations and market innovations should support the valuation assumptions. The fair value calculation implies an upside of 20% from current price levels.Overall, WDAY’s analyst day event reiterated the medium-term thesis. Specifically, growth levers such as further expansion into international markets, greater market penetration in the financials segment, greater focus on procurement, and uptake of new products to its existing client base. These growth initiatives are supported by the company’s continued focus on product innovation – which should provide a competitive advantage over other cloud providers amid a strong demand environment."

When will this reverse?Why investors should avoid Workday.","Workday (WDAY) has a lot of promise and there is a lot to like about the company. However, its share price already reflects its entire opportunity and much, much more.Back in the Summer, I wrote:This is the stock's performance since then:And below is my unwavering stance on the stock:If before shareholders were not asking the difficult questions from their investment, you can be confident they are now.I attempt to shed some light on the answers, and overwhelming posit that readers should sidestep this investment.Reading through Workday's Financial Analyst Day last week, any mere mortal would be seduced by Workday's capabilities. The talk of land grab, clear definition of two separate verticals, namely Human Capital Management and Financials, as well as smaller emerging opportunities are enough to make one's head spin.(source)What about the competition? Please! Why destroy a beautiful story with such ugly facts?Jesting aside, common sense should make one at least weigh up the fact that SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (ORCL) not only have the distribution but are also more recognizable names.Source: Investor DayBulls would counter my bearish stance by pointing to Workday's net retention rates being impressively high.That is certainly true. In actuality, the market is not totally wrong on Workday. There is plenty to like in Workday. My sole issue with Workday is over shareholders' negative risk-reward reflected in its valuation.Workday is valued at close to $35 billion market cap, so it has to be doing something right - I do not disagree. Furthermore, Workday's revenue is approximately 85% from recurring sources.Consequently, this high level of predictable revenues is the reason why the investment community is valuing Workday this high. As I noted earlier, the market is not totally wrong on Workday, although I contend that investors are overpaying relative to its underlying opportunity.Source: author's calculations, SEC filingsAs the graph above depicts, the more that Workday's revenue grows, the bigger the GAAP losses it is forced to incur.For a considerable amount of time, investors were happy to turn a blind eye to this performance. But at some point investors start to question, when are they likely to see Workday breaking even?In my previous article, I highlighted that there is a discrepancy between Workday's version of its cash flows from operations and its actual free cash flows, once capex and real estate projects are accounted for.Source: Too Far, Too Fast - AvoidThe graph above reflects that Workday is not as asset-light as many believe it is.For now, none of the facts shown appear to point to a healthy company ticking along nicely. In my mind, this feels like an investment to be avoided.Source: author's calculationsAs noted, Workday has numerous positive attributes. My argument boils down to paying up more than 10x trailing revenues for a company that is yet to break even is nothing short of speculation.Bullish shareholders would declare that Workday is a rapidly growing enterprise, and that I'm being too bearish the name. That's possible, but why chance it? Why overpay for Workday than practically any of its peers?I praised Workday's strong and sustainable recurring revenues, as well as its strong revenue growth rates. But even then, I do not believe investors are getting much upside potential left at its present valuation.Remember the adage, revenue is vanity, profit is sanity and cash is reality? In this case, I believe that Workday's shareholders would do well to pay heed to this proverb."
4315532,100666,2020-01-07T04:11:55-05:00,"Workday injects AI into the office space and is, therefore, a stock of the 21st century.Workday's stock has dropped because the general SaaS was down and then it fell further because of a consensus miss for the guidance for the next quarter.Workday is at a P/S ratio of 11 now and historically a P/S of 10 was Workday's bottom.The new product offerings that come out next year and the accretive acquisitions will only have a meaningful impact in FY 2022 (next year).Therefore, the stock price of Workday may be hanging around this level for 12 to 16 months, giving long-term investors a window to scale into the stock.","Finally, growth stocks had a big jump at the end of last week. Despite the revival, a lot of growth stocks are still considerably below their 52-week highs. That, of course, doesn't automatically mean that they are undervalued, but it can present an opportunity for patient, long-term investors to pick up a few excellent quality growth stocks at a reduced price. I took the advantage to open a position in Workday (WDAY), a stock still down 25% from its 52-week high. In this article, I explain why.(Source)Workday provides cloud solutions for enterprises. It mainly helps companies to simplify HR (human resources) and financials using AI. For example, Workday can analyze tens of factors (think of salary, the time between holidays, managerial changes, etc.) to decide which employees are at risk of leaving the company, so the company can take the extra effort to retain those employees. After all, turnover is a costly affair.I have talked about Unscaled with the subscribers to my Potential Multibaggers Market Place, It's a book by Hemant Tenaja. In his interesting book, the author (a venture capitalist) argues that unscaling, bringing products to the level of the individual is the new trend and it will be at the heart of most of the evolutions of the 21st century.(Source)The way to personalize is artificial intelligence or AI. This technology allows companies to personalize everything, from fashion to business solutions to healthcare. Mass production has become a disadvantage to companies, not a competitive advantage anymore, as it used to do in the 20th century.AI recognizes patterns, gives advice, predicts, automates, adapts and much more, all tailored to your own needs. That's the big advantage that Workday has over its competitors, mainly Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP). These giant companies have market caps of $172.5B and $160.5B, while Workday only has a market cap of $38.8B. I'm not saying that this is small or that Workday is already capable of everything SAP and Oracle are but I just want to indicate the market Workday is playing in.One of Workday's product offerings is Workday Financial Management, an application for all kinds of accounting solutions: accounting, an overview of accounts payable and receivable, cash, revenue and asset management, grants, but also more specific needs, such as project and resource management, time and expense tracking, project billing, financial reporting to several stakeholders, and, very important for Workday, analytics.(Source)On Workday's website, there is a video in which clients testify why they switched to Workday. Jane Aboyoun, the CTO of New York's Public Library has the greatest moment, in my opinion. She's trying to sum up reasons why the New York Public Library became a Workday customer. The first three reasons come very easily, then she says: 'And four...' and then a somewhat longer pause. Finally, she says, somewhat softer, less the businesswoman, more from her heart: 'Everybody loved it.' Those moments are important to me. The heart is still underrated in business, while feelings and gut often drive more decisions than most people are willing to acknowledge.But Workday does a lot more. It also has Workday HCM or human capital management, its legacy offering. That is, again, as with Financial Management, a big, comprehensive solution. It holds workforce lifecycle tracking and organization management, salary, benefits and other compensation, absence, goal and performance management, succession, career and development planning, recruiting, time tracking, payroll and learning.The HCM division of Workday slowed down to about 20% growth in Q3 2020, Workday's most recent quarter. Psychologically, this was a blow to some investors, since this is historically the breakthrough business of Workday and a lot of investors still identify Workday with this product, although the slowdown for HCM was not a surprise at all and had been anticipated. The reason is that Workday already has a big footprint for HCM. Workday's CEO Aneel Bushri on the Q2 2020 conference call:With 40% of the biggest 500 companies in the USA already as clients and half of the biggest 100, it's no surprise that the growth decelerates. The low-hanging fruit probably has been harvested and a lot of the biggest contracts have been signed. But I'm pretty sure there is still a lot of expansion possibilities for the Global 2000. Therefore, I expect Workday to continue its constant growth of around 20% in HCM. Since the penetration rate of global big companies is still only 17% and half of the biggest 100 US companies already use Workday's solution here, I expect at least half of the Global 2000 to switch to Workday's HCM and probably even more over the long term. The big companies usually clear the road for the smaller ones in these things and especially if the biggest American companies are already so convinced, most of the rest of the world follows in the next five to ten years. Workday will also trickle down to smaller companies within the US.Because the projections for subscription revenue growth will decelerate to 21% in Q4 2020 (versus 23.6% expectations), the stock fell even a bit more after it had already sold off quite a lot in the general-SaaS-market-sell-off that had been hammering SaaS (and some other growth stocks) since this summer. This is Workday's graph in the last six months:Data by YChartsA very interesting branch of Workday is the 'other solutions'. This includes, as you can expect, several solutions. Just to name the most important: Insights Business Planning Cloud, (intelligence, partly AI, for finance, HR and sales teams), Workday Prism Analytics (that combines data with analytics tools for financial and people analytics to make business decisions), Workday Student (a student and faculty information system for colleges and universities) and Workday Data-as-a-Service (which analyses data so users can make better decisions). I think in the future there is a huge potential in these other solutions and therefore they could be the engine that keeps Workday compounding for years and years and years.One of the most important new initiatives of Workday is its Adaptive Insights. It's a business planning tool that is cloud-based and was acquired in 2018. In Q3 alone, a bit over one year after Workday bought it for $1.55B, Adaptive Insights showed its potential with over 200 new first customers and over 50 new platform and upsell deals signed by Workday customers. This was even faster than in Q2 and I don't think the acceleration has run its course yet.While the slowdown in subscription revenue to the low 20% (I think it will be higher than the 21% guided for, but not that much higher) could justify a drop (because of deceleration fears), the short and medium-term outlook promise a lot of good things. In FY 2021 (the fiscal year that starts on February 1, 2020), there will be a lot of new offerings, including the Workday Cloud Platform, People Analytics, and the Employee Experience Solution.But because launches are not done at the beginning of the year and it takes time to introduce the new products to existing customers, the subscription revenue will only be meaningfully impacted in FY 2022. If these new offerings are successful (and given Workday's history I think they will) the subscription revenue might reaccelerate again next year.Scout, which Workday announced to acquire in November 2019, also will have no meaningful contribution to the next FY revenue, but it is expected to grow in FY2022.These factors combined could mean that Workday's valuation may be depressed over the next twelve to sixteen months. As I see Workday as a growth compounder for years to come, I think this period is an excellent time and opportunity to scale into the stock.Workday is not cheap but for quality, a premium is often warranted, as long as it is not completely out of whack with reality.If you look at Workday's EV/S chart, you will see that over the last three years, the line didn't really go deep below 10 and was more than 16 before this sell-off: If you look at the price of the stock over the last three years, you see a different pattern, one that rises over time:Data by YCharts133%, that's a CAGR of 32.5%, although that is just a snapshot, of course. I think that Workday will be able to generate returns of at least double the market for years to come.Workday has a financial plan. CFO and co-President Robynne Sisco on the Q3 2020 earnings call:25% plus non-GAAP operating margin is great and I think, because of the nature of Workday's business, it could even turn that into a GAAP operating margin of 25% or more. That's the advantage of scalability.Bigger software companies like Adobe (ADBE) already have that 25% GAAP. Oracle even has a GAAP operating margin of almost 35% and a profit margin of 27.6%. The negative side is that Oracle's revenue growth only came in at 0.5%. SAP, the other giant in the field, has lower GAAP operating margins (17.70%) and profit margins (12.60%) but still grew its revenue by 12.8% YoY. Those examples perfectly illustrate that Workday has to forego profitability for now in order to grow and it's also the reason why it looks so expensive based on traditional metrics: a negative P/E, a forward P/E of 93.5, etc. But these are not good metrics to judge Workday on right now.That doesn't mean that Workday is a steal and as with every growth stock, there is a possibility for high volatility. There is still always the possibility that the stock might go nowhere over the next few years. That wouldn't be the first time. This is the performance of the stock between April 2013 and February 2016, a period of almost three years:Data by YChartsIf you look at the P/S of Workday over that same period, you see that it went to about 10, just as it was just a while ago (to remind you: it's about 11 now).Data by YChartsThat's why I always favor scaling into positions over a few years. It's a form of dollar-cost-averaging. All stocks, but especially the best, move with jumps and stops, not linear and building out a position over a few years can make you take advantage of that system. Holding on is the key. After all, this is what the stock has done since February 2016:Data by YChartsFor those who are worried about the 3 years of stagnation: Workday still beats the S&P 500 comfortably:Data by YChartsSince Workday's P/S ratio is near 10 again, I think this is an excellent time to open a position. This is not a Potential Multibagger so it will not multiply by 4 in less than two years as Shopify (SHOP) has done since I first recommended it. But it is a great company for the new economy and it's a stabilizer in my portfolio. Even if it doesn't shoot up straight away, it's a great buy-and-hold stock for the real long-term investor.Workday's drop provides an opportunity to start a position (or to add to an existing position). Historically, the stock was good value at a P/S ratio of around 10, which is the case at the moment. With numerous new products in the pipeline, the earnings might reaccelerate next year. In the meantime, the stock might trade sideways and long-term investors can use that opportunity to scale into the stock.If you have enjoyed this article and would like to read more articles about growth stocks from a long-term perspective, feel free to hit the ""Follow"" button next to my name.In the meantime, keep growing!"
4309755,20715,2019-11-29T11:41:46-05:00,Workday is set to report fiscal 2020 third quarter earnings after the closing bell on Tuesday.The company has grown its earnings and its revenue at an above-average pace over the last few years.The stock experienced a pullback recently and that put the stock in oversold territory for a brief period.Sentiment toward the stock is skewed to the bearish side.,"Application software firm Workday (WDAY) has been performing very well in recent years, both the company and the stock. The company is set to report fiscal 2020 third quarter earnings results on Tuesday and investors are expecting good things from the California-based company.Workday provides its customers with various solutions to human and capital resource decisions. The cloud-based software can help with such tasks as general accounting, accounts receivable, accounts payable as well as human resource management.Analysts are expecting the company to earn $0.37 per share on revenue of $920.78 million. The company earned $0.31 per share in the third quarter of 2019, meaning that analysts expect earnings growth of 19.4%. Revenue came in at $723 million last year, so it's expected to grow at a rate of 27.4%.As impressive as the expected earnings and revenue growth rates are, they would actually be lower than what the company posted in the second quarter. Earnings were up 42% in the second quarter and revenue was up 32%.Over the last three years, the annual earnings growth has averaged 129% and revenue has grown at a rate of 34%. Analysts expect earnings to grow by 24% for 2020 as a whole while revenue is expected to grow by 27.3%.Workday's management efficiency measurements are good with a return on equity of 18.3% and a profit margin of 13.8%.The stock's P/E ratio is high at 113 and it doesn't pay a dividend, so it is definitely a growth stock and not a value oriented investment.Since the beginning of 2017, Workday has been on an incredible tear. The stock is up over 170% and was up almost 240% before a recent pullback. The pullback could be providing investors with an opportunity to get into the stock. From the peak on July 11 through the low on October 23, the stock fell over 32%. It has since bounced back 18%.There are a couple of things that jumped out at me from the weekly chart. First, both the 10-week RSI and the weekly stochastic readings were both in oversold territory for the first time since the end of 2016 thanks to the recent pullback. The indicators have since reversed course with the rally in the last six weeks.The second thing that jumped out at me was how the stock seemed to find support at its 104-week moving average. This moving average represents two years' worth of data and the stock hasn't really tested it since the first quarter of 2017.We also see that the weekly closing lows from 2016 and 2018 form a trend line and the stock just tested that trend line with the pullback in the third quarter.Turning our attention to the sentiment toward Workday, we see that two out of the three indicators I always check ahead of earnings are showing signs of pessimism. There are 35 analysts covering the stock with 19 ""buy"" ratings, 14 ""hold"" ratings, and two ""sell"" ratings. This puts the buy percentage at 54.3% and that is below average and indicates slightly more pessimism toward the stock than the average stock.The short interest ratio is at 5.20 which is above average and also indicates slightly more pessimism toward Workday than the average stock. The ratio was pretty high back in July but then fell through the end of October. The mid-November reading showed a jump as the number of shares sold short increased and the average daily trading volume dropped sharply.The put/call ratio is at 0.676 and this is the one area where we are seeing more optimism toward Workday than the average stock. There are 54,137 puts open at this time and 80,028 calls open. The ratio is well below the average ratio which is in the 1.0 range and the current reading is lower than the 0.85 reading we saw on August 29 - the last earnings report for the company.With the fundamental indicators being better than the average stock, the chart pointing to a reversal after the recent pullback, and the sentiment being skewed toward the bearish side, I am bullish on Workday as a long-term investment.I view the bearish sentiment from a contrarian perspective. Should the company beat earnings and continue to show the strong growth pattern it has shown for the last few years, analysts and short sellers may be forced to switch camps. If short sellers are forced to cover their positions, this can add buying pressure to a stock that is already rallying.Workday does have a history of beating earnings estimates and has done so in each of the last eight earnings reports. Even though the company has beaten estimates, the stock hasn't reacted in a positive manner each time. In fact, the pattern seems to be that the stock falls after the earnings reports more times than not. What this suggests to me is that the optimism ahead of earnings is greater than the actual optimism following the report. However, within a few days to a few weeks after the earnings reports, the stock has tended to stabilize and then resume its upward trend.If you own the stock already, I don't suggest that you sell it ahead of earnings, but you should be prepared if the pattern plays out like it has in the recent past. If you are looking to add the stock to your portfolio, I would suggest waiting until after the report and then look to buy it in a few days. Even in the instances where the stock gapped higher after earnings, it pulled back after the initial surge."
4297500,104608,2019-10-20T18:18:52-04:00,"Workday held a rather upbeat and positive analyst day, however their stock has fallen over 15% since then.Management discussed significant international opportunity given under-penetrated markets and reiterated their 25% operating margin guidance.Valuation has come down given recent weakness and looks pretty attractive at ~8x a conservative FY21 revenue estimate.","Workday (WDAY) has been through a rather volatile year so far, wit the stock up as much as 40% to $225 in July, now down to under $160. After their recent analyst day this past week, the stock took another big hit, trading down over 15% the following few days. While management talked about HCM growth of ~20% per year, this was known throughout the market and should not have come as a surprise to many.International growth prospects remains very strong and management also talked about continuing their penetration in the North America market, despite being the clear market leader.Data by YChartsWhile investors have continued to love the name, it seems like valuation has kept the stock back from significantly outperforming. Shares are down over 15% since the company’s analyst day which seem to be a big overreaction to somewhat stale news. It also did not help that the entire software market was hit the past week as investors seems to shift their likings away from growth and more towards value oriented names.I believe now is a great buying opportunity for WDAY given management reiterated their long-term operating margin guidance of ~25% and discussed the international expansion opportunity. Despite the stock having nearly $3.5 billion in revenue over the past year, revenue growth remains very healthy at ~25-30%. Even if revenue starts to decelerate more than expected, the company already has massive scale and the law of large numbers eventually has to hit in, right?WDAY has continued to post revenue growth near the 25-30% range over the past several quarters and despite management talking about HCM revenue (which makes up ~80% of subscription revenue) growth of ~20%, the company will still perform above average. WDAY has done an incredible job penetrating the market and at some point we all knew they would reach an inflection point where their revenue growth would start to decelerate, and that should not be worrisome.The other 20% of their revenue is comprised of other fast growing areas such as ERP/Financials. WDAY’s Financials offering (known as FINS) is growing over 50% and poses a significant opportunity for WDAY to continue their above average growth rates. Despite WDAY having a 38% penetration in the G2K HCM market within North America, this penetration rate drops to only 11% when looking internationally.Source: Company PresentationThe company’s international opportunity remains very healthy, despite the core HCM penetration starting to saturate a bit. For example, management talked about the 11% G2K penetration internationally as well as this penetration rate being only 13% in their EMEA region and <10% in APJ (excluding China/India).In addition, overall bookings mix has become more diversified and has moved away from US-based large enterprises. Even as WDAY remains the leader in that cohort, the company’s diversification will help them continue to grow above normal rates.Source: Company PresentationWhen looking at net new ACV bookings, US large enterprises only made up 35% of FY20, down from ~57% in FY15. Smaller, more concentrated US verticals now represent ~18% and as the company continues to expand internationally (~27% of net new ACV bookings), we could see revenue growth remain healthy and diversified.Investors seem to continue to concentrate on the US market where WDAY is likely to see revenue growth decelerate over time. Management talked about US large enterprise growth remaining an opportunity, with WDAY having 40%+ of Fortune 500 companies, compared to 25% from other cloud HR vendors. This leaves ~35% of the Fortune 500 market open for competition within the US large enterprise market.These metrics look very different when looking internationally.Source: Company PresentationThe opportunity internationally remains much greater for WDAY when looking at the share of Global 2000 customers. Currently, WDAY has a ~17% share of these customers, with ~13% coming from other cloud HR vendors. This mean WDAY is the clear leader even in the underpenetrated international market. With ~70% of the market remaining an opportunity and WDAY having a ~60% win rate, this could mean WDAY could have a ~59% market share if the Global 2000 customer become fully penetrated. This remains a massive area for growth that WDAY will continue to benefit from over the years.Source: Company PresentationAttach-on products also remains a large opportunity. Despite cloud growth slowing down, customers are increasingly using more add-on products, which improves the overall ACV for each client. WDAY estimates that ~20% of their net new ACV comes from add-on bookings, such as planning tools, analytics, training, and others. As WDAY continues to build out these modules, add-on products could continue to become an increasing amount of a customer ACV, which could offset cloud growth deceleration.Long-term operating margin guidance was reiterated at 25%+ with the company noting that their HCM business is already producing operating margins above this range. As the Financial modules continue to grow and gain scale, these margins will eventually reach the company’s goal of 25%+.Source: Company PresentationEven if revenue growth disappoints and investors lose confidence in the company’s ability to grow 20%+, the strong operating margins should offset this. Software companies typically start to see margins expand once revenue growth decelerates to 25-30%. Considering WDAY is already guiding FY20 operating margins of 12.3%, investors should feel confident in the margin expansion opportunity.Operating margin expansion will come from three key areas. First, the company will continue to post strong revenue growth. Second, gross margins will improve over time as the company gains additional scale. And third, operating efficiencies will improve over time as operating expenses such as R&D and S&M typically slow down as scale increases.Valuation has taken a hit over the past few weeks as investors have moved out of faster growth, higher valued software names and into more value oriented names. Some of the more expensive names in the market such as Zscaler (ZS) and Atlassian (TEAM), have seen their stock go down quite a bit from investors pulling back valuation expectations.WDAY has seen their revenue grow 25-30% over the past several quarters and I believe 20%+ revenue growth is still the right way to view the business over the long term.Data by YChartsWDAY has a current market cap of ~$35.25 billion and with cash of $1.93 billion and debt of $1.23 billion, the company has a current enterprise value of ~$34.55 billion. Using management’s subscription revenue guidance (not total revenue) of $3.06-3.07 billion during their most recent earnings release, this implies a FY20 subscription multiple of ~11.3x. If we were to include Professional Services revenue guidance of ~$520 million, this would give us a FY20 revenue multiple of ~9.6x.While this valuation is not cheap, WDAY is deserving of a premium valuation given above average revenue growth and the large margin expansion opportunity. If we were to assume FY20 total revenue of ~$3.6 billion were to grow a conservative 20% in FY21, this would give us FY21 revenue of ~$4.32 billion and a FY21 revenue multiple of ~8x.I believe WDAY should be valued much higher than 8x FY21 revenue and with the stock now trading below $155, I believe it is a great opportunity to pick up some shares on sale."

4295768,69905,2019-10-09T13:53:03-04:00,"Why savvy investors should avoid this stock.Discussing the allure towards Workday.On balance, why it has no margin of safety and the stock is best avoided.","During the summer, I wrote bearishly about Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) where I stated the following:Since that article was published, the stock is down 19%. Does this newly found discount offer investors enough margin of safety to become shareholders? I passionately assert that it does not. In fact, I declared that the risk-reward remains negatively skewed and that investors should avoid this stock. Here is why:Simple but not easy - as the old adage goes, right? During 2017-2018, any company describing itself as a Software-as-a-Service ('SaaS') was being viewed as a new paradigm company.These companies surely could do no wrong? Strong tailwinds to their backs; rapidly growing (and recurring) revenues; in a fast-expanding market - you all know this narrative well by now.Meanwhile, value investors were a thing of the past. Well, yes and no. Admittedly, for a long time, the market was absolutely correct. These SaaS platforms were expensive five years ago, and they would all go on to become even more expensive presently. And, the market was absolutely correct. But too much of a good thing can be bad, as the market has a tendency to overreact.The game of a value investor is never to time the top in the stock and exit her position with grace - not at all! The game for a value investor is to seek out opportunities where the odds of failure are minimal.Because, ultimately, everyone fails at some point. But, by being selective, one would know enough to stay away from Workday at close to $48 billion market cap (price in the summer).Does this imply that, since Workday today trades at close to $38 billion, it is priced as a bargain? Frustratingly, I still cannot find enough reasons to be drawn to this investment.Having said that, don't get me wrong, the underlying dynamics of Workday certainly have significant positive appeal. As I said earlier, the market has erred on the correct side of the valuation. My sole contention is that new shareholders will struggle to find enough upside potential.The table below is not only a reminder but ultimately a delight to look at:Source: Author's calculationsConsider just how stable the above GAAP revenue growth rate is? Investors crave certainty. For the certainty of a predictable revenue growth rate of above 30%, investors are happy to pay a premium.Combine this insight with the promise of an asset-light company, and no price is high enough. Everyone becomes a buy-and-hold forever investor. Particularly, while the stock continues to steadily increase in value, day after day and month after month.Contrary to Workday's management claims, some unpleasant facts start to creep in around the edges. For example, note below the steadily growing cash flow from operations that Workday frequently touts:Source: author's calculationsBut then, notice Workday's adjusted free cash flow where I have netted out Workday's capex and real estate projects - a very different sort of performance starts to emerge.Accordingly, despite generating trailing twelve months revenues of just over $3.2 billion, this asset-light enterprise does not strike one as being a particularly strong cash-generating company.Source: author's calculationsInvestors that closely follow this sector have become highly accustomed to the whole sector trading at a premium.However, those investors with their fingers on the pulse might also have noted that investors on mass investors are exiting their positions away from cloud/SaaS companies.Data by YChartsIs this a bleep on the radar? Or are investors starting to be more selective?This article raises more questions than answers. Luckily, investors don't need to have the answers to these questions. They simply need to know enough to recognize that Workday is overvalued and that there are plenty of other safer investments available."
4297026,103480,2019-10-17T10:40:18-04:00,"Shares of Workday dropped double-digits after the company's analyst day foreshadowed a deceleration in core HCM revenues.The company has projected that growth in HCM will slow to 20% y/y by the end of the fiscal year.This isn't ""new news"" per se. Workday's revenue growth has hovered around ~30% y/y for several quarters now, but that growth has been propped up by ERP/Financials.Workday has plenty of headroom to grow in that category, especially as newer areas like business planning (from Adaptive Insights) take root.","The article was also shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more about PRO+ here.Workday (WDAY), long an investor favorite in the software sector, has seemingly stepped into the penalty box after the company's 2019 investor day. In front of a panel of Wall Street analysts, the company's executives foreshadowed a slowdown in growth of HCM (human capital management), the flagship product that put Workday on the map.Shares of Workday are down more than 10% since the announcement and have fallen 30% from their July highs altogether, dragging down the rest of the software sector on the concern that growth deceleration is a secular headwind against the entire software industry:Data by YChartsLet's cut to the chase: I believe the additional dip in Workday shares offers a fantastic opportunity to buy shares in an iconic software company at tremendous value.A quick check on where Workday is currently trading - at present share prices in the ~$159 range, Workday has a market cap of $36.3 billion. After netting out the $1.93 billion of cash and $1.23 billion of debt on Workday's most recent balance sheet, we arrive at an enterprise value of $37.0 billion. This puts Workday's current valuation at just 9.1x EV/forward estimated revenues, based on a 25% y/y growth rate on the company's trailing-twelve month revenues of $3.24 billion. For most of its lifetime as a public company, Workday has traded at revenue multiples in the low teens; peer stocks with a similar growth rate and scale, such as Adobe (ADBE), Autodesk (ADSK), and ServiceNow (NOW) all trade at double-digit forward revenue multiples:Data by YChartsI've doubled down on my position in Workday this week, and continue to believe that the stock is worth 12x EV/forward estimated revenues, or a price target of $216 and 36% upside from current levels.The elephant in the room is Workday's forecast that growth in core HCM will slow to 20% y/y by the end of the year. To me, this isn't new news. Workday hasn't broken out its revenue growth by product as Salesforce.com (CRM) does, but over the past several quarters, revenue growth has hovered in the ~30% y/y range. One can deduce that Workday's much older and more mature HCM business, which comprises ~80% of the company's subscription revenues, is growing at a rate in the mid-20s, while the company's relatively newer ERP/Financials offerings as well as acquisitions like Adaptive Insights are ratcheting the overall company's growth rates higher.How concerning is Workday's slowdown in HCM? To me, not very. Workday is already the undisputed market leader in cloud HCM. Over the past several years, Workday has dramatically multiplied its market share within the space, as shown in the chart below from the company's analyst day presentation:Figure 1. Workday HCM share gainsSource: Workday analyst day presentationLet's do some quick sizing - Workday's most quarterly subscription revenue was $757 million, and the company has estimated that ~81% of the company's total subscription revenue mix in 2020 will come from HCM (that's down from >95% in FY15, by the way, which illustrates how far the Financials product has grown in contribution over the years). This indicates that Workday's cloud HCM business is running at a ~$2.5 billion annual clip rate.Isn't it natural for a business of this size to hit ~20% y/y growth rates? Look at Salesforce as a good comparison. Salesforce does break out its revenue growth by product, and its own flagship product Sales Cloud (which is at a ~$4 billion annual clip rate) has fallen to just 13% y/y growth, and continuing to decelerate every quarter. Yet investors aren't panicking anew about Salesforce's slowdown in its flagship product like they are for Workday.For Salesforce, the reason investors aren't worried about slowing Sales Cloud growth is the fact that Salesforce's venerable brand has allowed it to use Sales Cloud as an introductory ""hook"" that brings customers into the Salesforce ecosystem, which comprises solutions across marketing, customer service, platform, and many others.Workday is slightly smaller than Salesforce in overall scale, but the story is no different. It already has a second major product in Workday Financials, and under that umbrella, the company has seen fantastic growth in automated business planning tools thanks to its acquisition of the fast-growing Adaptive Insights last year.Workday notes that ~20% of its net new ACV comes from add-on bookings. Planning tools, as well as newer modules such as Prism (analytics), Learning (a training tool that puts Workday up against companies like Cornerstone OnDemand (CSOD)) are becoming a more important driver of Workday's growth:Figure 2. Workday attach-on productsSource: Workday analyst day presentationAfter seeing Workday's expected deceleration in HCM revenues, Wedbush analyst Steve Koenig has criticized Workday for not having a ""third act"" after HCM and Financials, which he believes will curtail Workday's long-term growth.In my view, this is rather short-sighted. As seen in the slide above, Workday has plenty of tertiary products - some of these categories, like Planning and Learning, are the entire businesses of several of Workday's peers. In addition to these growing categories, Workday has a ""war chest"" of $1.93 billion in cash, and it's shown in the past that it's not afraid to make splashy acquisitions.Just because core HCM is seeing a natural slowdown in its growth curve doesn't mean that Workday is planning on idling. The chart below showcases the company's growth strategy in the near term:Figure 3. Workday growth driversSource: Workday analyst day presentationAnd aside from product category extensions, it's also worth noting that Workday has made progress on both verticalization efforts (which have won the company many major deals in the healthcare space) as well as international expansion, which currently only makes up 24% of Workday's overall revenues.Lastly, it's worth noting that in a turbulent market environment that has punished high-growth, loss-leading companies (especially new entrants like WeWork), Workday's commitment to expanding profitability acts as a stabilizer on its share price.The company remains on track to deliver roughly two points of operating margin improvement this year to 12.3% (on a pro forma basis); the company expects to progress toward a long-term goal of 25% pro forma margins:Figure 4. Workday margin growthSource: Workday analyst day presentationAt the same time, the company has continued to deliver outsized cash flow growth. This year, the company is estimating 30% y/y growth in operating cash flows to $790 million; if we extrapolate this growth rate forward to FY21, the company will crack $1 billion in annual operating cash flows - giving Workday plenty of dry powder to make acquisitions to chase growth:Figure 5. Workday cash flow trendsSource: Workday analyst day presentationWorkday's current modest valuation is a big inducement for me to increase my stake in the company, especially when I continue to see minimal red flags in the company's fundamentals. Yes, Workday's HCM business is maturing - but that doesn't mean that vertical expansion, international pushes, and newer products categories can't make up the difference. Stay long here and buy the dip."
4292024,103480,2019-09-17T10:23:35-04:00,"Workday's performance has continued to hold up strong, with its latest quarterly growth rate clocking in at 32% y/y despite its massive scale.Alongside its core strength in HCM, Workday has also become a powerhouse in ERP. The company has passed the one-year mark of its acquisition of Adaptive Insights.The company has also achieved tremendous gains in margins and cash flow.The stock has been trading in a downtrend since July, and is down ~25% from recent peaks, technically putting it in correction territory.","This article was selected to be shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more here.Since the invention of software-as-a-service as a technology category, two companies have reigned on top of the enterprise SaaS market for years: Salesforce.com (CRM) and Workday (WDAY), each of them dominating CRM and HCM systems, respectively - two of the largest markets within enterprise software. Each year, these stocks tend to vastly outperform the broader market, while their scale and relative profitability also offer a greater sense of security versus smaller, faster-growing tech startups.Naturally, whenever a company like Workday enters into correction territory, investors' ears should perk up. Workday rallied through July, but has fallen sharply in the months since, especially after its August earnings release. Relative to its mid-July peak, shares of Workday are down 23%:Data by YChartsIn my view, I find nothing especially worrying about Workday's Q2 performance or the near-term horizon that would warrant such a large correction. Nor is Workday's correction an expression of a large valuation unwinding, as has been the case over the past month for stocks like Anaplan (PLAN) or Twilio (TWLO).In fact, I find Workday's valuation quite attractive especially after its most recent correction. A quick check on where the stock is currently trading: at current share prices around $173, Workday has a market cap of $39.44 billion. After netting off the $1.93 billion of cash on Workday's balance sheet against $1.23 billion of convertible debt, we arrive at a net cash position of $0.7 billion and a resulting enterprise value of $38.74 billion.Over the trailing twelve months, Workday has generated $3.24 billion in revenue. Let's assume that Workday is able to achieve a 25% y/y growth rate over the next twelve months - a fairly conservative assumption, given that Workday grew revenues at 32% y/y this quarter. (Note that Workday's Q3 guidance, shown below, implies 25-26% y/y subscription revenue growth, primarily due to lapping the Adaptive Insights acquisition, but this has always trended on the conservative side). This gives us a forward-twelve month revenue estimate of $4.05 billion.Figure 1. Workday Q3 and FY20 guidance updateSource: Workday 2Q20 earnings releaseThis puts Workday's current valuation at just 9.6x EV/FY20 revenues, a rare occurrence for a stock that has consistently traded at valuation multiples in the low teens. Among large-cap SaaS stocks (comps shown below), Workday is rarely among the cheapest in the group (Salesforce's valuation multiple has always trended lower due to its slower growth rate and aggressive M&A style):Data by YChartsIn my view, Workday's recent correction has put it in strong buy territory. The stock has shown remarkable resilience in previous corrections - for instance, snapping back quickly from its November/December losses last year. The company is worth at least 12x EV/forward estimated revenues (putting it approximately in-line with Adobe, which has a slower ~25% y/y current growth rate but richer margins to compensate), implying a price target of $216 and 25% upside from current levels.Load up on Workday while shares are still cheap.Let's circle back on Workday's most recent Q2 earnings release, which gives us no cause for concern (despite the negative reaction in the markets since). The company's earnings summary is shown below:Figure 2. Workday 2Q20 resultsSource: Workday 2Q20 earnings releaseRevenues grew 32% y/y in Q2 to $887.8 million, barely decelerating over last quarter's 33% y/y growth rate and smashing Wall Street's expectations of $872.4 million (+30% y/y) by a comfortable two-point margin. At Workday's ~$3 billion annual revenue run rate, we would expect growth rates to see a steeper deceleration curve; however, Workday has consistently been able to maintain growth north of 30% y/y.The quarter's strength was broad-based, with the company noting significant wins and renewals on both its HCM product as well as its financial suite. Big HCM wins this quarter included The Gap (GPS), Black & Decker (SWK), and Europe's grocery giant Aldi. The financial suite, meanwhile, had enormous public sector wins - signing on the governments of UK and Singapore, as well as the city of Baltimore.Aneel Bhusri, Workday's CEO, also noted that Adaptive Insights is seeing tremendous success in converting wins for Workday and bolstering the capabilities of Workday's ERP suite. Per his prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:It's worth noting as well that Workday is seeing strong growth overseas, with non-US revenues growing 35% y/y (three points faster than overall revenue growth) and representing a 24% mix of total revenues. Workday's traction with large overseas conglomerates like Aldi, as well as with international public sector clients, demonstrates how powerful its brand has developed on a global basis. Bhusri also commented that Workday saw especially strong performance in the Asia-Pacific region in Q2, despite many other software companies citing China headwinds as a major reason for revenue deceleration. In terms of maturity, Bhusri believes the international market opportunity is three to four years behind the U.S. in terms of maturity, signaling plenty of greenfield deal opportunities.Workday isn't just a growth story, however - its margins have also been performing incredibly well. As a software company like Workday grows larger, it tends to still grow its sales and marketing expenses, but at a slower clip than revenue growth - allowing it to achieve greater operating leverage. This quarter, Workday's pro forma operating margins ticked up to 13.2%, a remarkable 310bps improvement over 10.1% in the year-ago quarter. The company's pro forma EPS of $0.44 also beat Wall Street's expectations of $0.35 with a solid 26% upside.Cash flow is another highlight of Workday's story; in Q2, operating cash flows jumped 74% y/y to $100.3 million:Figure 3. Workday cash flowsSource: Workday 2Q20 earnings releaseIt's fairly obvious that Workday hasn't run in to the same ""sales execution issues"" that has plagued other software companies like New Relic (NEWR), Zendesk (ZEN), and Pluralsight (PS) over the past several months - yet Workday's stock has also undergone a harrowing correction.Look forward to the growth drivers propelling this stock. We've discussed multiple vectors for growth - from international expansion, especially among lucrative public sector clients. Product extensions and cross-sell is another important growth driver - though Workday doesn't report net retention/expansion rates like many of its peers, the fact that Workday owns two market-leading applications in HCM and ERP indicates plenty of opportunity to become a one-stop shop for backend people and finance management for its clients. Workday's strong balance sheet, with ~$2 billion in cash, gives it plenty of flexibility to pursue transformative acquisitions like Adaptive Insights (which cost Workday $1.55 billion last year). At the same time, it's not as trigger-happy as Salesforce, which routinely shells out billions of dollars a year on splashy acquisitions to shore up its growth rates, to the chagrin of investors who'd rather see Salesforce improve its margins.Buy Workday on the dip and wait for it to rebound to its usual low-teens valuation multiples."
4276482,104608,2019-07-22T13:38:04-04:00,"Workday continues to be one of the most consistent long-term software investors and will likely continue to be one.Q1 earnings were very strong with revenue growing 33% to $825 million, well ahead of consensus expectations.Valuation remains a bit excessive, albeit a majority of the software market is currently trading at premium multiples.","Workday (WDAY) has proven to be one of the most consistent long-term investments in the software market by continually posting beat and raise quarters. Although they reported Q1 earnings a few weeks ago, it seems like investors keep pushing the stock higher, now trading near all-time highs. At these levels, I am a little more cautious to put new money to work and would look to hold my position steady heading into Q2 earnings.Workday remains one of the heading human capital management software providers and their software solutions are found in many large enterprises throughout the world. Q1 earnings were very strong with both revenue and EPS beating consensus estimates, leading to management raising their guidance for the year. The stock immediately went down nearly 10%, the stock has outperformed since then, gaining nearly 15% since post-earnings low.Data by YChartsWorkday remains a relatively expensive stock with valuation being more appealing during the latter part of 2018 when the market was in a correction phase. With the stock currently trading at ~13.5x forward revenue, it is challenging to defend building a new position at these levels. With Q2 earnings right around the corner, it would be wise to hold on to your position for now. I wouldn't recommend trimming a position as I believe the stock will continue to rise over time, however, it might be a good idea to take some well-deserved profit with the stock at near all-time highs.Q1 earnings were strong, per usual. Revenue grew a very impressive 33% to $825 million, which was well ahead of consensus expectations for $814 million, or ~31.5% growth. Subscription revenue continues to be the main driver of growth, growing at 34% during the quarter, reaching $701 million in revenue, or ~85% of total revenue.Source: Company PresentationWhile professional services revenue represents the remaining ~15% of revenue, this revenue stream has operated at a negative gross margin for some time, continually weighing down on the overall company operations. While it is necessary for all software companies to have this type of revenue, there could be some improvement over time as subscription revenue grows faster than overall revenue and represents more and more of the overall revenue, ultimately leading to greater margins and profitability.Source: Company PresentationDuring the quarter, Workday reported operating margin of 13.1%, which was pretty close to the year ago period. However, the stronger than expected revenue growth led to EPS of $0.43, which was ahead of consensus estimates for $0.41. Operating cash flow continues to remain healthy, growing 14% to $209.2 million. While management's current guidance for FY20 includes operating cash flows of $790 million, they noted this will likely be back-half weighted due to a seasonally weaker Q2 cash flow performance.Source: Company PresentationIn addition to a strong start to the year, management raised their full year guidance. Subscription revenue is now expected to be $3.045-3.060 billion (~28% growth), which is up $15 compared to the previous guidance of $3.030-3.045 billion. In addition, Q2 subscription revenue is expected to be $746-748 million, representing growth of 32%.I believe management's guidance could be slightly conservative given Q1 growth rate of 34% for subscription revenue appears to have strong momentum and a deceleration down to 28% for the full year would require a quarter or two below 28% growth. However, it should be noted that they will lap the Adaptive Insights acquisition they made in Q3, which could result in lower subscription revenue growth on a pro-forma basis.While valuations remains elevated with the stock near all-time highs, it is challenging to know what the appropriate multiple is to pay for this large cap software company. Typically, companies who trade over 10x forward revenue have growth of 30%, margins beginning to expand, and a large addressable market, all of which Workday has.There has been some new competition entering the public markets recently, most notably Anaplan (PLAN), which recently grew their revenue 47% in their most recent quarter. While there will always be competition in this space, it is worth noting Workday remains the largest, most established player, giving them more credibility in the marketplace.Data by YChartsEven when the market was weak during the last few months of 2018, Workday was able to defend their premium multiple, despite valuations contracting across the market. Investors have historically been very bullish of this name, which has helped drive valuation and the stock price to near all-time highs. However, with valuation and the stock at these levels, I would be cautious adding to these levels.Subscription revenue represents ~85% of total revenue and drives the company's growth rate, growing 34% in the most recent quarter. Professional services revenue on the other hand comes with a much lower margin and grew ~29% during the last quarter.Given management's subscription revenue guidance of $3.045-3.060 billion (~28% growth) and professional services revenue to be $500 million, we can expect total revenue to be ~$3.545-3.560 billion (~15% growth). Even if we were to assume subscription revenue comes in at the high end of guidance, we could see total FY20 revenue of $3.560 billion, which would be ~26% total growth.Assuming we see some sort of deceleration in FY21, Workday still appears to trade at a relatively expensive multiple. Assuming ~26% subscription revenue growth and a stable 15% growth for professional services, both of which seem more optimistic than pessimistic, we could see total FY21 revenue of ~$4.43 billion.Using the current market cap of ~$48.25 billion, total debt of $1.22 billion and cash/equivalents of $1.89 billion, we get to an enterprise value of ~$47.6 billion. This represents a FY21 revenue multiple of ~10.7x, which seems to be relatively expensive. Remember, these assumptions are somewhat optimistic and it appears investors have already priced in an optimistic performance through the rest of this year and the year after.While I am not supporting a short thesis on the name as I believe the stock will continue to be a winner over the long-term, it is challenging to defend a thesis where now is the best time to build a position in the name. I would wait until the price dips a bit to pick up some shares. With guidance appearing somewhat conservative for the remainder of the year, we could see another strong performance in Q2 which may send the shares higher.Risks to Workday include increased competition from both legacy players and new entrants. Valuation continues to remain at a premium which could pose a risk if premium-valuation stocks take a hit during any market correction. However, over the long-term, this is definitely a name to hold on to."
4296874,24634,2019-10-16T15:24:21-04:00,"WDAY’s looks to be gaining momentum after a 3-month slide of 20%.
        Workday Inc.’s “subscription” revenues grew 34% in 2Q 2019.
        Financial Management Services vertical is beginning to show momentum.
        One-year anniversary has passed since the acquisition of Adaptive Insights.
        Recent Analyst Upgrade from Goldman Sachs could be a sign of more to come.","Note: All images, unless otherwise noted, show data from the Best Stocks Now database.Workday Inc. looks to be getting back to “work” after taking a sabbatical this summer. WDAY shares began sliding back in July after hitting an all-time high of $226.83. Finishing 20% down from the $226 level on Friday (10/11/2019) at $180.44. Now that the summer trading doldrums are over, I believe Workday Inc. is poised for a bounce.Coincidentally, I first wrote about Workday Inc. back in 2014 (It's All In A Workday). When valuing the shares in 2014, I placed a 5-year Price Target of $175 on the shares. WDAY was a relatively young company back then, just 2 years post IPO in March of 2014. A number of the same catalysts for growth exist today and I believe the shares can double again over the next 5-years (coincidentally, my 5-year Price Target is $360.88).When valuing SaaS plays in the Technology sector, I place a high emphasis on “Visible Sustainable Growth”. Growth accompanied by high visibility increases the probability that lofty growth rates will be “sustainable”, allowing my Best Stocks Now! Rankings to place a higher confidence level on our 5-year price targets. So which factors do we focus on in an effort to judge “visibility” and “sustainability”?Workday Inc. is a Human Resources and Financial Management software maker that has year after year shown well in our Best Stocks Now! rankings. I currently own the shares in the Gunderson Premier Growth and Gunderson Ultra Growth portfolios (I have been in and out of the shares since the IPO in 2012).Most recently sitting at #176 out of 5335 in our Best Stocks Now! rankings, the prospects are looking good for WDAY to remain inside the Top 250 which I follow closely on a daily basis. Demonstrating the afore mentioned factors for “visible sustainable growth” plays heavily into our high ranking for the shares.As my previous readers know, my Best Stocks Now rankings blend Fundamental and Technical analysis. I assign a weighting to factors across both disciplines and those stocks scoring the highest make up the upper echelon of my rankings. Historically as an industry, financial analysts have looked at Fundamental and Technical characteristics of stocks in a vacuum. In my 22+ years of experience, I have found that incorporating both into my models allows me to better avoid “value traps” and “high fliers” with great charts, but no visible earnings to back them up.For full disclosure, Workday, Inc. has continually shown negative GAAP EPS since going public in 2012. This loss is mostly due to stock issued compensation (which management puts a high emphasize on) and reinvestment into the overall business. Meanwhile, “Normalized EPS” has grown at an actual/estimated 20-30% per year (in line with Revenue growth). In light of the GAAP EPS losses, our Best Stocks Now! App’s will focus on “Revenue”, primarily the “sustainability” of these income streams and accompanying growth rates.Over the last three years, WDAY has continually grown top line revenues at a CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) of 33.95% per year, and I believe this trend has a high probability of continuing. Workday Inc.’s SaaS business model generates 85% of their revenues from “subscription” customers. Subscription revenue recognized in Q2 2019 exceeded $757M, a 34% year-over-year increase.On the second quarter earnings call, management raised their estimated guidance to $3.07 Billion for subscription revenue in fiscal year 2020. WDAY also has a healthy backlog of subscription revenue totaling $7.03B, $4.77B of which will be recognized in the next 24 months. The current subscription backlog weighs heavily in our “visible sustainable growth” investment thesis.Workday Inc.’s core product, Workday HCM, is a “sticky” vertical with a focus on creating long-term customer relationships. On average, customers typically are onboarded via a 3-year contract. WDAY has been ranked among the highest in the industry for customer satisfaction, increasing the probability that renewal rates will remain high. High renewal rates correlate with “sustainable growth”.In regard to Market Share, WDAY continues to make gaines. In the most recent quarter, Workday’s customer base included: 40% of the Fortune 500, 50% of the Fortune 100, and 17% of the Global 2000. WDAY continues to attract large multinational companies to their platform, with “international” revenues making up 24% of topline sales (an YoY increase of 35%).By attracting large companies to their core platform, Workday is opening up new opportunites to “cross-sell” their other products. As a result, WDAY’s Financial Management Services and Adaptive Insights platforms have shown accelerated growth. The Financial Management Services vertical grew revenue at 50% last quarter and is seeing more and more opportunities along side the Adaptive Insights (200 new deals in Q2 2019) solution aquired by Workday Inc. a little over a year ago. Management remains optomistic that these successes will continue into fiscal 2020 and beyond.As mentioned earlier in the article, “Momentum” also plays heavily into my Best Stocks Now! rankings. Since going public in 2012, Workday Inc. has vastly outperformed the S&P 500 in 3 out of 6 years. Annually averaging 15.3% more than the S&P 500 over the last three years (26.9% to 11.6%) and 35.7% over the last 12-months (44.6% to 8.9%). Keep in mind that these figures take into account the recent 20% drop in the stock price over the last 3-months. In spite of the recent correction, WDAY continues to be an alpha generator in my portfolios.Lastly, let’s take a look at the chart. For the most part, the technicals looked very healthy coming out of Q4 2018 and continuing into the first 6 ½ months of the year. After hitting an all-time high of $226.83 in July, the chart quickly broke down, falling below the 50-day moving average by month’s end. The stock looks to have built a base around the $170 mark with support at the $165 level. The 50-day moving average is close to showing a positive slope possibly signaling better days are ahead for the share price.After a rough last 3 months, Workday Inc. continues to recover its’ place atop my Best Stocks Now! rankings. I am interested in hearing what comes out of their “Analyst Day” in Orlando on October 15th. Any positive revisions to guidance by WDAY’s management team could be a catalyst for more upgrades like the one by Goldman Sachs on Friday, October 11th. After Heather Bellini’s upgrade, the shares rose $6.12 or 3.51%.Personally, I continue to remain “Very Bullish” on WDAY (I hold it in both my Premier Growth and Ultra Growth portfolios at Gunderson Capital Management) and currently have a 5-Year target price of $366.88 for the shares (100% over the recent closing price on 10/11/2019).As with all “highly valued” stocks, any hiccup in earnings and/or guidance can create immediate selling pressure. However, Workday Inc. continues to check our criteria boxes for “visible sustainable growth”, reducing the risk of “surprise” misses and subsequent corrections to the stock price."
4277002,103603,2019-07-24T09:52:21-04:00,The 2030 workforce crisis could push Workday higher.It is not the time to get it.It is highly overvalued.,"Workday (WDAY) is expected to deliver extraordinary revenue growth during 2019, and the market estimates it will be growing enviously in the following years.Investing in the company presents a balanced risk-reward proposition with acceptable downside and good upside potential, and as for its price, it is highly overvalued.Workday is a large-cap company with a market cap of about $47 Billion with acceptable financials. It provides cloud services of HR and finance and has been having an excellent run. It is a great company, and the future is bright, but it is not the time to get the stockWorkday provides cloud services for HR and finances. A niche market that companies rarely want to take in-house, as it typically is not part of their core business, and is in constant demand.From the HR side, getting the right people and managing the careers of all the employees is a tough job which rarely gets the attention it deserves. Workday is betting that companies will pay a lot more attention in the future on how they manage HR and how they can get an edge in recruiting and retaining talent.As Rainer Strack eloquently points out, migration patterns, low population growth in developed will drive talent shortages in many professions. The higher the lack of people capable of doing a job is, the higher the attention will companies put in recruiting and retaining that talent.The analytics and products that Workday has will allow small and medium-sized companies to acquire talent and design policies of HR competitively. Some large companies might decide to take matters in-house, which could reduce Workday's market. However, many others will surely leverage both the in-house systems with Workday products.While workday provides a superb service and job shortages might push the stock afloat, the current price is too high, and the valuation for the future does not hold much upside.ValuationConsidering revenue growth is in the range of 23% and 25.2%, and gross margin has a minimum and maximum of 72.3% and 73.8%, projecting that R&D as a percentage of revenue could range between 39% and 38.4%, expecting that G&A as a percentage of revenue has a minimum and maximum of 19% and 18.8% we have the following chart.Source: Author's ChartsThese approximations are in line with the market expectations for Workday in the next couple of years, as the image below shows.Source: Seeking AlphaI like to use Peter Lynch's ratio when valuing a stock. This method uses the ratio between the expected earnings growth plus dividends and the P/E of the stock to determine its fair value. A stock that has a 1:1 ratio is reasonably priced. The higher the number, the more underpriced the stock is.Source: Author's ChartsThis valuation does not take into account the assets and liabilities of the company. The growth considered in the valuation is the expected growth for the next year. Considering Iterated growth allows us to analyze better stocks that have uneven growth rates in time, taking as reference non-GAAP earnings.With this valuation, the stock is at worst overvalued by 83% and at best overvalued by 62%. So the stock is overvaluedSource: Author's ChartsConstructing an adjusted Beta Pert risk profile for the long-term prospects of the stock, we can calculate the risk profile for the companySource: Author's ChartsThe risk profile shows there is a 49.78% probability that Workday will ever trade at a lower price than it is today. Considering the potential downside, upside and the likelihood of each, the statistical value of the opportunity of investing now, is of 0.1%Let's explain in greater detail the statistical value of the opportunity to invest in a company. The statistical value is the sum of all the possibilities that an event or a proposition have multiplied by their respective output.Betting heads on a coin flip, where if you win, you will get 100% return, but if you lose, you will lose 100%, has a statistical value of 0%. If someone were to bet an infinite number of coin flips, they would end up with the same money they began.On the other hand, if the odds of the coin flip were heads, you win 200%, and tails, you lose 100%, the statistical value of the bet would be 50%.In this case, the upside and downside potential are almost identical. There is little to no value inherent to investing in the company now. Its prospects are exciting, and a dip might change the scenario, but now, it is not the time to buy.The core business of Workday is decent, but the current price is highly overvalued, and even if the workforce crisis of 2030 pushes Workday to the top side of the estimates, it might not give a payback big enough to justify holding the stock.Although the downside potential is quite low, the last year's performance was excellent, and the level of risk is symmetrical, the company also has problems, the expected return for next year is terrible, the risk-reward is absurd, and the price is discouragingly overvalued.Current holders of the stock might want to consider selling the stock. Workday could end up performing just fine for the next years, but the overvaluation poses the risk that if sentiment changes, the stock could have a significant downturn. In a past article, I proposed a similar strategy for IRobot (IRBT), and weak guidance if the stock sent it plummeting.Investors who plan to hold the stock should consider if they have the stomach to hold their shares in those kinds of situations.If there is anything in this article, you agree or disagree with or would like me to expand further on; I would sincerely appreciate you leaving a comment. I will address it as soon as possible."
4290489,105400,2019-09-09T09:29:31-04:00,"Workday has fallen roughly 25% since its 52 weeks high.
        However, Workday has maintained 30% sales growth for four consecutive quarters.
        Workday is fairly undervalued by 12% based on my estimates.","Workday's (NASDAQ: WDAY) stock price has fallen roughly 25% from its 52 weeks high, mostly due to multiple adjustments. Despite the big drop in share price, I believe that Workday is a leader in its space with growing switching costs. At $172, it is also reasonably priced with a potential 12% upside based on my valuation estimates. (Source: Google)Workday has managed to break into the human capital management (NASDAQ:HCM) and financial management (NYSEARCA:FM) space that was historically dominated by two players, SAP (NYSE: SAP) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). Besides being customer-focused, Workday managed to convince customers to embark on the digital transformation journey to cloud finance and human resource. By being cloud-first, Workday was able to differentiate itself from Oracle and SAP which were still holding onto their traditional on-premise software solutions. Workday has been able to help their customers go live quickly so that the customers are able to reach value faster. The speed of going live has been improving over time and it is currently at 8.2 months on average. As such, more than 40 percent of the Fortune 500 and approximately 50 percent of the Fortune 100 have selected Workday for their core HCM platform. Gartner has also placed Workday as a leader among the Cloud HCM suites.(Source: Gartner)Moreover, cloud adoption for Workday's solutions is still mostly underpenetrated at less than 25% so there is still a long runway for Workday to invest and grow its business. This can be seen from the way Workday invests its cash as well. Workday invests 31% of sales in R&D, which is roughly twice that of its competitors. (Source: Workday financial analyst day 2018)(Source: Workday financial analyst day 2018)As customers switch to the cloud-based model for their HCM and FM needs, their up-front costs become lower compared to on-premise solutions. This reduces the customers' tendency to switch once Workday solutions have been deployed in their companies. Given how Workday has been focusing on winning businesses from large businesses, this decision has helped increase switching costs within this customer group. Large enterprises have very strong inertia to switch due to their complex geographical and employee structure. Paired with the lower upfront cost of a cloud-based solution, it would be harder to switch from Workday compared to SAP and Oracle. This can be seen from Workday's high gross and net retention rates of 95%+ and 100%+ respectively. (Source: Workday financial analyst day 2018)Workday's latest Q2 revenue of $887 million was 32% higher YOY and beat its guidance of $870 million to $872 million. This is Workday's fourth consecutive quarter of over 30% YOY revenue growth. The report also highlights that growth will increasingly come from outside Workday's core HCM offerings, as seen from its Financial management segment's revenue growth of 50% YOY.The acquisition of Adaptive Insights shows how Workday is attempting to help customers accelerate their finance transformation in the cloud. Having a collaborative financial planning solution from Adaptive Insights allow Workday to cross-sell to existing financial management customers. This will entrench customers deeper into Workday's services, making it harder to switch. As Workday slowly broadens its enterprise resource planning platform, there will more opportunities for increasing its average revenue per customer. Oracle and SAP have already begun their shift towards cloud-based solutions. Workday has roughly 20% of its revenue from outside the US in fiscal 2018. I am unsure if Workday can experience similar success globally given that Oracle and SAP are stepping up their cloud platforms. Workday's acquisition of Adaptive Insights shows that it is trying to move beyond HCM. However, Workday should be careful not to expand into a full enterprise resource planning solution too quickly. Being spread too thin at such a high-growth stage may lead to poor customer experience and execution issues in its current solutions. Potential investors should watch for future acquisitions to determine the velocity of Workday's product roadmap. To value Workday, I used a DCF model with the following assumptions:1) Revenue growth at 30% for the next five years, then dropping to 2% in perpetuity starting from the year 2025. The high growth rates in the first five years reflect Workday's lead in the cloud HCM space as well as its ability to cross-sell its solutions. Coupled with low penetration in cloud enterprise software, Workday should be able to execute high sales growth for at least the next five years. However, Workday will face competition internationally against key players like Oracle and SAP. If Workday is unable to convince large enterprise customers to switch over to its solutions, they might experience lower sales growth in the next few years.2) Operating margin of 35% from 2027 onwards. Enterprise software players generally have high operating margins due to their high initial fixed costs and low incremental costs. Operating margin of 35% is considered high but it is similar to Oracle's current margins. While Workday states its long-term operating margin target is 25%, I believe this is conservative and expect Workday to exceed it in the long term. Moreover, Workday's gross margins have been expanding in recent years, from 66% in 2015 to the current 70%. However, if Oracle and SAP are able to develop innovative cloud HCM and FM solutions, Workday might have to provide some incentive for customers to switch over especially in its international segment. If price becomes the only differentiating factor, there could be some downward pressure on Workday's margins. 3) A sales-to-capital ratio of 2 is in line with its software peers. Developing software is not capital-intensive, so I estimate Workday will be able to generate $2 of sales with every $1 in incremental capital.4) Workday has an initial weighted cost of capital of 9.22%, which drops to 8% in the terminal year. The higher cost of capital reflects the higher risk of Workday having negative cash flows and losing money. However, once the company achieves profitability and higher free cash flows, the risk should be reduced as reflected in the lower cost of capital.(Source: Author creation using Workday financials) The value I derived for Workday is roughly $44B for the entire company. This represents a 12% upside from its current price. As with all DCFs for high growth and money-losing companies, my point estimate valuation of $193 is likely to have a large spread of possible outcomes. To overcome this shortcoming, I compare its pricing multiples against similar software companies. (Source: Author creation using data from Gurufocus) Compared to established peers like Oracle, SAP and Automatic Data Processing (NASDAQ: ADP), Workday is very expensive on both Price/Sales and EV/Sales multiples. However, those established ERP players also have much lower sales growth of less than 10%. Workday is fairly priced when compared to Paylocity (NASDAQ: PCTY), which have lower sales growth but is a profitable HCM company. Potential investors have to decide if they believe Workday will be able to compete well internationally and achieve margins similar to Oracle. If so, Workday's recent pullback makes it a good time to buy."
4267979,103480,2019-06-03T12:05:00-04:00,"Workday recently released a bullish Q1 earnings report, sending shares upward (though the stock is still ~8% below all-time highs of $217).For the third quarter in a row, Workday managed to hold its revenue growth rate above 30% y/y,.Workday's acquisition of business planning software company Adaptive Insights is a critical component of its growth, cementing its leadership in finance/ERP tools.While GAAP EPS is still negative, Workday managed to grow both pro forma net income and operating cash flows in the quarter.","One of the safest long-term bets in the software sector is Workday (WDAY): quarter after quarter, the leading human capital management (NASDAQ:HCM) software provider continues to prove that it can execute like a machine and continue raising its targets. The company just released results for its first quarter, and in typical ""beat and raise"" fashion, Workday beat Wall Street's estimates on both the top and bottom lines while raising its outlook for the full year. Unsurprisingly, shares got a nice lift as investors cheered the results, though general trade-related market woes are still holding Workday shares below its all-time highs:Data by YChartsThere's no doubt that Workday is an expensive stock. I liked the stock much better toward the end of last year, when Workday was trading below $150 and its valuation multiple was two turns lower. Now, trading at 12.7x forward revenues, Workday trades in the upper echelon of valuations in the software sector,.Yet we note that Workday has consistently been able to retain a low-teens multiple - and even in the most painful valleys of the market cycle, such as last November/December, Workday's valuation multiple still clung to the ~10x range - indicating investors' confidence in the stock's ability to rebound, a thesis that has been resoundingly justified so far in 2019 (Workday is up 27% year-to-date, trouncing a 10% gain for the broader market).Though I'm typically more drawn to value-oriented software names such as Yext (YEXT) Mimecast (MIME) and Dropbox (DBX), I make an exception and keep Workday in my portfolio for a variety of fundamental strengths. The primary reason here is that Workday is a leader in not one, but two heavy-hitting categories of the SaaS market: HCM and ERP. Though many investors feared that Workday's saturation in the HCM space would lead to a slowing in growth rates, the company's pickup in ERP activity has allowed the business to retain its >30% y/y growth rates.Gartner recently named Workday a Leader in the Magic Quadrant for Financial Management Suites for the third year running, cementing its position as a ""best-in-breed"" vendor in the space. And versus competitors like SAP (SAP), Workday has a far better cloud-friendly reputation.Workday's acquisition of Adaptive Insights is another example of how the company continues to drive growth in the broad ERP space. We note that the business planning sub-category is experiencing phenomenal growth, as evidenced by pure-play competitor Anaplan's 47% y/y growth in its most recent quarter. Workday reported that it signed more than 150 new deals on Adaptive Insight's Business Planning Cloud this quarter, with notable wins including Airbus (OTCPK:EADSY), H&R Block (HRB), and the Ohio State University. Needless to say, there's plenty of cross-selling opportunity between Adaptive customers and Workday's core install base.Alongside Salesforce.com (CRM), Workday has retained its position as one of the original, category-leading SaaS companies. It has succeeded at maintaining a brisk pace of growth despite a ~$3 billion revenue scale, while also managing to retain profitability and boost cash flows. Its premium valuation is well-justified. Stay bullish on this name for the long term.Let's dive deeper into Workday's first-quarter results:Figure 1. Workday 1Q19 resultsSource: Workday 1Q19 earnings press releaseTotal revenues grew 33.4% y/y to $825.0 million, beating Wall Street's expectations of $814.2 million (+31.6% y/y) by a 180bps margin. Underlying subscription revenues also saw slightly faster growth, at 34.3% y/y to $701.0 million. We note as well that as a percentage of revenues, professional services fell 60bps to 15.0%. Though every SaaS business will need some portion of professional services to support implementations and onboarding of new customers, the lower proportion of this revenue the better - Workday performs professional services at a negative gross margin.Workday's finance and ERP products were the lynchpin to growth this quarter, with management reporting that over 50% of existing customers showed net new ACV growth. International growth was also a highlight this quarter, with non-US revenues representing an all-time record mix of 24% of total revenues. Here's some further commentary on Workday's top-line performance from Chano Fernandez, Workday's president and head of field operations, on the Q&A portion of the Q1 earnings call:Capitalizing on the strength seen this quarter, management raised its full-year outlook on subscription revenues to $3.045-$3.060 billion (+28% y/y), up $15 million on both ends relative to a prior range of $3.030-$3.045 billion. Considering that Workday kicked off Q1 with a 34% y/y growth rate in subscription revenues, however, it's likely that the company's full-year forecast is still conservative and contains one or two more points of upside (we note, however, that Workday will lap the Adaptive Insights acquisition in Q3).On the profitability side, Workday's rapid pace of hiring kept margins flat. The company onboarded 400 net new employees in the quarter, bringing the total quarter-end headcount to 11k employees. As a result, pro forma operating margins held at 13.1%, though on a nominal basis, pro forma operating income grew 37% y/y to $110.7 million, slightly outpacing revenue growth. Pro forma EPS of $0.43 also beat Wall Street's mark of $0.41 with 5% upside.Workday also notched 14% y/y growth in operating cash flows to $209.2 million:Figure 2. Workday OCF trendsSource: Workday 1Q19 earnings press releaseThough operating cash flow growth trailed revenues and saw a slight margin compression, Workday noted that it over-performed in cash collections in the fourth quarter. Combined with the fact that Q2 is a seasonally low quarter for collecting on billings, Workday's first-half OCF and FCF may appear weak - but the company is still likely to make up for it with a stronger second half. The company continues to guide to 30% y/y growth in FY20 operating cash flows to $790 million. Robynne Sisco, Workday's CFO, also noted that with the larger proportion of enterprise deals that Workday is signing, a lot of Workday's billings and closings are being pushed out to the fourth quarter - which represents a typical year-end enterprise buying pattern.Despite its massive scale, Workday has retained a phenomenal 30%-plus growth rate, and still manages to sign on blue-chip enterprise customers in large deals. New offerings like Adaptive Insights, which won 150 new customers this quarter, are critical here.With a towering reputation in both the HCM and ERP categories, there's no doubt that Workday remains at the top of its game. Though Workday's valuation is steep, it has remained perennially so. Investors would be wise to continue holding Workday through the long term."

On a positive note, its top-line growth continues to impress. On the negative side, not only is there minimal free cash flow being generated, but shareholders are being quietly diluted. Compounding the issues, its shares are fully pricing a lot of optimism already.On the surface, Workday has everything right going for it. Its subscription-based business model is focused on optimizing financial and human capital resources at both large and small enterprises.Also, given that the platform is delivered through a cloud delivery system, it has all the buzzwords investors crave to hear.Also, have a look at the graph below showing Workday's revenue growth rate.Source: author's calculations, SEC filingsWhat more can investors ask for than plus 30% growth rate, which is evidently steady and consistent? Surely, Workday is the envy of a great number of companies.But if you think this, you should dig a little deeper and think: what do I know that others are not already pricing in? Is there some aspect of the narrative which is not immediately obvious?Looking at a share price chart of Workday, investors have no doubts that their investment is a compelling opportunity.Again, the promise of subscription-based cash flows are just so alluring. Having said that, you may be surprised to know that Workday is in actuality highly capital intensive.In the graph which follows, I have calculated Workday's adjusted free cash flow accounting for its real estate projects (essentially office space). Also, I've included its data center infrastructure costs. You can follow these numbers yourself in Workday's 10-K.Source: author's calculations, SEC filingsPlease note the difference between the smooth blue line which management wants shareholders to focus on, and compare it with the dotted red line.Workday's adjusted free cash flows are not only lagging behind its operating cash flows from operations, but its adjusted free cash flow is much bumpier than one would think for a business which derives 85% of its consolidated revenue through subscription services.The table below highlights how stretched Workday's valuation already is. In other words, it is a reminder to readers that they are priming themselves for disappointment.Source: author's calculations, morningstar.comFor example, there is no question that appetite for companies with subscription-based fast-growing revenues commands a premium valuation. These companies are supposed to be high quality and should trade a premium price.Furthermore, given that 75% of Workday's revenue is U.S. based, this avoids a lot of uncertainty over potential tariff.But investors should nevertheless question whether paying more than 70x Workday's cash flows from operations is really presenting themselves with any sort of bargain opportunity?One could counter argue this by saying that the sell-side only sees upside potential from here, with a sky-high share price target of $260. But investors should not be overly focused on these rosy outlooks. Indeed, some common sense and skepticism go a long way.Workday finished fiscal 2017 with an average of 198 million shares outstanding.Then, fast forward just slightly more than 2 years and Workday's total outstanding number of shares have increased by close to 13%.This is to be expected given that Workday's stock-based compensation for each one of the previous three full fiscal years amounts to more than Workday's total cash flow from operations, which is astonishing. This is yet another reminder that this a very expensive management team.There is no doubt that the stock is richly valued. And given that it has no history of making an actual profit, investors are be being seduced by its rapidly growing revenue.Workday's valuation demands absolutely flawless execution. Any minor mishap in any single quarter and its share price will dramatically reprice lower.Readers should best avoid this stock.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive emails of my latest research, please click ""Follow"" at the top of this article."

Workday's recognition in the industry also is translating to higher revenues, as was evident in its first quarter result announcement.Workday's first quarter revenues grew 33% over the year to $825.1 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $814 million. Its net loss widened to $116.3 million, or $0.52 per share from $74.4 million, or $0.35 per share recorded a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, it recorded an EPS of $0.43 which was ahead of the Street's forecast of $0.41 and grew over previous year's $0.33.By segment, Subscription services revenues grew 34% to $701 million, ahead of the management's guidance of $692-$694 million. Professional services revenues grew 29% over the year to $124 million and exceeded guidance of $120 million.For the current quarter, Workday expects to earn subscription revenues of $746-$748 million and professional services revenues of $124 million. It expects to end the current year with subscription services revenues of $3.045-$3.06 billion and professional services revenues of $500 million. The market was looking for subscription revenues of $741.6 million for the quarter and $3.047 billion for the year.In its recent annual summit, Workday's management focused on the growing importance of Machine Learning (ML) within cloud computing. It believes that ML will ""disrupt the marketplace"" as it helps customers make better decisions. It's already developing ML and graph processing capabilities that can be leveraged across all of its applications.It's working with its customers and focusing on concrete use cases as already are apparent to them. The first application-specific use of ML and graph analysis is its newly launched Skills Cloud, which powers a Skills Insight feature that will discern team, employee, and candidate skills and offer-related recommendations on hiring, training, team building, and project planning. Workday is building its ML capabilities on open-source technology, and, in some cases, Workday-developed algorithms. These platform-level ML capabilities will help power augmented analytics and planning capabilities across its platform.It's also working on deploying ML within the user experience arena. It's building a self-modifying user experience that will adapt to the customers as their needs change. The self-modifying user experience will be designed to learn from and adapt to that user.Within the analytics segment, Workday released a unified reporting architecture for all Workday users called the Discovery Board. The service leverages shared ML, graph and pattern-detection capabilities available across the platform and integrates it with natural-language generation capabilities to turn raw data into actionable insights. It plans to introduce multiple augmented analytics applications but has first started with a Workday People Analytics app. The app has been released to design partners and uses ML, graph, and NLG-powered insights to help organizations focus on hiring, workforce composition, diversity and inclusion, talent and performance, and retention and attrition.The market is pleased with Workday. Its stock is trading at $195.79 with a market capitalization of $44.25 billion. It had touched a 52-week high of $217.73 last month. It had fallen to a 52-week low of $117.24 in June last year."

(WDAY) is one of the five stocks that will ultimately make up the modern tech stack, according to ServiceNow (NOW) CEO Jack Donahoe. The other four companies are Salesforce (CRM), Adobe (ADBE), ServiceNow, and Microsoft (MSFT) (Office 365).(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)Workday has outdistanced the other four of its peers over the last year with an impressive 70% gain in stock price. Investors certainly believe that Workday will definitely be a future mainstay in the digital workplace.Workday sports a 33% YoY revenue growth, decent free cash flow margin, and has a promising future as a leader in at least two industries. I love this company! There is just one problem, and that is that Workday is overpriced at the moment. But I believe that there will be an opportunity to get in at a better price if I have read the stock chart correctly.According to Gartner Magic Quadrant, Workday is an industry leader in both Cloud HCM Suites for Midmarket and Large Enterprises and Cloud Core Financial Management Suites for Midsize, Large, and Global Enterprises. In both of these markets, Oracle (ORCL) is the company's prime competitor.(Source: Gartner)Gartner scores Workday's products high in product functionality and customer satisfaction. Oracle, on the other hand, scores lower on both functionality and customer satisfaction partially because the software is new and has not yet been fully deployed by customers.In any case, cloud adoption is still in its early days and should fuel Workday's revenue growth for several more years.(Source: Workday financial analyst day 2018)Internationally, cloud implementation lags that of the United States by several years. Currently, Workday's international sales represent 23% of total revenues, but international growth is strong and will be a big contributor to Workday's continued growth story.(Source: Workday financial analyst day 2018)Workday invests significantly more than its competitors in R&D, improving the likelihood that it will remain a leader.(Source: Workday financial analyst day 2018)As I explained in a recent article on Splunk (SPLK), high-growth companies such as Workday generally aren't understood by analysts. These companies can't be measured by the standard metrics that analysts are used to. The result, if you follow analysts' advice, will be a lost investment opportunity.In place of traditional value factors, I generally focus on other measures, such as revenue growth, free cash flow margin, and the software company ""Rule of 40"".Workday had a great year with trailing twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of 33%. The company's 5-year annual growth rate of 43% is also extremely good. Management is guiding towards high 20s YoY growth for 2019, but their guidance is usually very conservative, and we will likely see around 30% revenue growth YoY for this year.(Source: Portfolio123)Workday's free cash flow margin TTM has been positive since the start of 2015 and is currently sitting at 7.6% of revenues. The free cash flow has taken a hit recently as a result of acquisition and increased headcount.(Source: Portfolio123)Workday's gross profit margin (GM) has been a steady 76% since mid-2015. The best SaaS companies have a gross margin in the neighborhood of 85-90%, but Workday's GM is not bad. The lower GM is a result of non-recurring professional services.(Source: Portfolio123)SaaS businesses tend to burn cash, and Workday is no exception. SG&A expenses are 85% of revenues, higher than what would be expected from a mature software company, which would typically have a figure around 50-60%.(Source: Portfolio123)Note that SG&A includes sales and marketing, general & administrative, and R&D.Workday's SG&A expenses had been steadily declining until the start of 2019 where they have started to rise again. But, at least, the SG&A expenses are less than total revenues, which is not the case for some SaaS stocks that I have analyzed recently, such as Okta (OKTA), which has more than 100% SG&A as a percentage of revenues.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the ""Rule of 40."" It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use the free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as the figure is useful in a later part of my analysis.The Rule of 40 is interpreted as follows: If a company's growth rate plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more, then the SaaS company has balanced growth and cash flow and is considered financially healthy.In Workday's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 33% + 7.6% = 40.6%Since the calculation comes out slightly higher than 40%, I conclude that Workday is financially healthy.Revenue growth plus FCF margin is sometimes referred to as the ""Efficiency Score."" It has been determined that Efficiency Score has a greater than 70 percent correlation to a public SaaS company's revenue multiple, which is the valuation divided by revenue.In order to demonstrate this, I have plotted the EV/Sales multiple versus the Efficiency Score in MS Excel for 48 software stocks from my digital transformation stock list. A linear trend line is plotted through the scatter plot that represents the best-fit valuation multiple for a given Efficiency Score.(Source: Portfolio123 /MS Excel)As can be seen from the above graph, Workday sits modestly above the best-fit line through the data points.The rest of this analysis is somewhat controversial. For me, at least, it seems logical to assume higher valuation for higher growth companies, and I use the best-fit line to gauge a company's valuation relative to the rest of the stocks in the custom universe. This is a relative valuation, not absolute as one would attempt to get using a DCF calculation.Based on the above chart, I conclude that Workday's stock price is overvalued relative to the rest of the digital transformation stocks in my custom universe.As can be seen from the stock chart below, Workday's stock price has been bouncing up and down within an ascending channel for the last three months.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)In the absence of any company-related news, I expect that there is a high probability of a pullback in the next few days, and that will provide a better entry price in the $210 range. Waiting for a better price is a risk unto itself as there is the possibility that the recent price surge may be the start of a major breakout, in which case this will be the story of the big fish that got away. That is the risk of waiting for a pullback.Workday appears to have a very strong future, potentially being one of the last companies standing in the race towards the digital workplace. The company is a leader in two industries that still have a relatively low level of penetration.The company has YoY revenue growth of 33% and is likely to achieve similar growth for several years based on a high level of customer satisfaction, outsized R&D investments, and international expansion. The company scores quite well on the Rule of 40, a rule of thumb that estimates a software company's health. But in my estimation, Workday is overvalued, and it is likely that there will be a pullback in stock price that will make a better entry point.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"

YouTube provides a good introduction to the company’s products which include:Secondary products include:Customers pay different subscription amounts dependent on the combination of products and add-ons selected.The Human Capital Management application market is the market which Workday’s Human Capital Management product operates within. Gartner estimated the 2017 market size at $12 billion in total software revenue (cloud and on-premise) with cloud adoption at 53% and expected to slow over the next 3-5 years as the laggards eventually shift over within an 8-10 year period. The largest players by revenue in 2017 were SAP (NYSE:SAP), Workday, ADP (NASDAQ:ADP), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL):Source: Apps Run The World, January 10, 2019 using 2017 dataWorkday would be the largest market player now:Workday has gained market share because its product is superior to others by a large margin. However, this competitive advantage has narrowed over the last two years as Oracle and Ultimate Software have recently become more competitive:Looking at Workday’s competitors:Gartner reported that Oracle has approximately 1,700 live customers with a large proportion being multinationals. Strengths include customer satisfaction, customer service, upgrades, system performance, social capabilities, customization, compensation planning, career and succession planning, and benefits administration. No material weaknesses were identified.SAP “has new leadership that is prioritizing improvements”. The software can operate in 92 countries with payroll support in 42. Weaknesses include customer satisfaction, application functionality, product capability, and reporting.Ultimate Software has approximately 4,100 clients and targets midmarket to large U.S. multinationals. Strengths include cost/pricing, performance management, career planning, succession planning, and above average ratings from customers in all subcategories. Weaknesses include a reliance on third-party solutions. “Ultimate has moved upmarket to now frequently compete against Workday, Oracle or SAP SuccessFactors, all of which have initiatives in place to scale downmarket. The competition has taken notice and, in some cases, has developed more attractive midmarket pricing and packaging. It cannot be assumed that Ultimate will always be the lower-priced option.” (Gartner)Ceridian has 3,100 live customers, provides a unified solution with above average customer satisfaction mainly suited to midmarket companies, with weaknesses in learning, career and succession planning.ADP has approximately 325 live customers, is strong in payroll services, analytics, benchmarking, and core human resources, and, is weak for customization, learning, career development and succession planning.Meta4 has a strong presence in Western Europe and Latin America with approximately 1,600 clients. Strengths include recruiting and workforce planning whilst weaknesses include system performance, ease of use, and incorporation of advanced technologies.Infor has 180 customers targeting enterprises with revenue above $100 million and more than 1,000 employees. Weaknesses include the software’s social capabilities, reporting and analytics.Ramco Systems is Indian-based and has 350 customers targeting Asia/Pacific multinationals. Customer satisfaction is below average.Kronos has approximately 450 customers mainly suited to small information technology and human resources departments. The software performs well in payroll, benefits administration and work force management. Weaknesses include recruiting, onboarding and customer satisfaction.Talentia Software has more than 3,600 clients across 30 countries with a focus on midmarket multinationals in Western Europe. Strengths include learning and core human resources, weaknesses include decreasing customer satisfaction.Workday is mentioned by Gartner as having the highest overall customer satisfaction for application functionality.Gartner also mentions that some firms are hesitant to embrace cloud solutions because of cost, security concerns, apathy, competing IT priorities, and integration challenges. They also mention that artificial intelligence is the future for job applications, human resources policy questions, and business planning.Future competition will intensify as evidenced by the following observations:Workday Financial Management operates in this market. Gartner sizes the Enterprise Resource Planning Financial Management market at $14.8 billion in 2018 with forecast growth at 7% CAGR from 2018-2022. Software as a service (SaaS) currently accounts for 23% of market revenue and is forecast to reach 35% by 2022 (20% CAGR growth) for Workday’s subsegment of the market which should reach $6.8 billion by 2022. Non-cloud revenue growth is forecast to grow at 2.1%.2016 market share within the entire Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Market (i.e. Financial Management plus Services & Operations) was presented on slide 24 of a 2017 presentation from Oracle.The 2017 market share was estimated as follows:Source: Apps Run The World, January 10, 2019 using 2017 dataWorkday doesn’t appear in the market share charts above but its Financial Management revenue at approximately 50% of subscription revenue would be $1.19 billion within the Enterprise Resource Planning (which includes cloud and on-premise) market giving it a small but respectable share.Workday has established itself as a leader in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Core Financial Management Suites:Gartner sees Workday as a leader that’s innovative, with a robust product that’s highly functional and proactive with audit and compliance functions, where analytics are a notable strength. A key weakness is the need to sell their product to new customers beyond upselling to existing ones: “During the past year, we have not seen significant improvement in Workday’s ability to broaden its market reach.” (Gartner)Looking at Workday’s competitors:Oracle ERP Cloud: “Oracle’s SaaS applications remain a key global strategic focus as the company moves to become a cloud service company. Oracle ERP Cloud is one of the primary solutions within this strategy and is receiving significant investment… Oracle ERP Cloud is the top offering in terms of functional capabilities” (Gartner). The target market includes midsize, large and global companies across 140 countries.Oracle NetSuite: Mainly serves 17,000 customers in the business services, retail, wholesale, and high technology sectors with revenue below $500 million. Expansion plans include China, India, Brazil, Mexico, France, Germany, and Japan.Microsoft’s Dynamic 365 targets midsize and large companies in 118 countries. The product is early in its lifecycle with implementation difficulties and consequent negative feedback from customers mentioning complexity, slowness, and customization issues.SAP (S/4HANA Cloud) is SAP’s premium cloud product for Enterprise Resource Planning, targeting mid-size and large companies in 33 countries. The product appears to be a work in progress with customers reporting some functional gaps despite it being in the top quartile for customer satisfaction.Sage Intacct targets small and lower-midsize companies in the services and not-for-profit sectors with its focus expanding from North America to Europe and Asia. Sage Intacct receives positive feedback from customers for its ease of use and integration.Product quality and execution: The Gartner rankings above exhibit Workday’s product leadership and management’s ability to execute. This has led to a 98% customer satisfaction rate from more than 2,600 customers, with 40% of the Fortune 500 using Workday’s Human Capital Management application (transcript).Revenue growth: There has been exponential market demand for Workday’s subscription services since 2012. “We have been growing the [Financial Management] business at … a 50% clip on the subscription revenue side now for quite some time” (transcript).Cash from operations is trending higher: The income statement shows operating losses, but these are due to stock-based compensation (which is a noted negative for shareholders). Upwardly trending cash from operations could produce significant free cash flow in coming years because technology companies are asset-light with low capital expenditure requirements.Selling, general and administrative expenses are declining as a percentage of revenue: All other things being equal, profitability should increase as revenue grows.Revenue growth rates are trending lower: Workday was in the right place at the right time providing cloud-based Human Capital Management subscription services when industry demand accelerated. Since the Human Capital Management market is forecast to grow slowly in the future (discussed earlier), revenue gains must come from increased market share which is finite. And in its new Financial Management market, Workday faces much stronger competition. Regarding professional services revenue, Workday expects that “the rate of professional services revenue growth will decline over time and continue to be lower than subscription revenue growth.” (p. 29) Professional services include training, deployment services, and optimization services. Year-over-year growth in subscription revenue backlog (subscriptions are typically sold on a three-year basis so the backlog growth is a key forward-looking metric rather than headline revenue growth which recognizes deferred revenue) is expected to be in the high 20% range for the first half of 2020 and in the low 20% range for the second half of 2020 (transcript).Growing product development expense: Workday faces intense competition for qualified employees and has to pay them generous compensation (including stock based compensation) to retain their services which decreases profitability (p. 8). As a counterpoint, Workday expects its expenses including product development to decline as a percentage of total revenues with time (p. 29).Insider stock sales: See OpenInsider.New markets: Workday Student is an example of how the company can pursue new markets in the future, sales should accelerate once four to five large universities are into production (transcript). Workday states that “We intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We have invested, and expect to continue to invest heavily in our product development efforts to deliver additional compelling applications and to address customers’ evolving needs.” (p. 29)Increased market share within existing markets:Workday added 79 Financial Management customers in the last quarter including Ryder Truck, Ameriprise, and Banner Health. This included four Fortune 500 companies, two of whom were new customers (transcript), that were replacing legacy Enterprise Resource Planning systems like Oracle’s PeopleSoft (transcript). Financial Management is growing faster than Human Capital Management and is the major growth driver moving forward (transcript).A growing total addressable market for all of Workday’s products: Source: Workday investor presentation, October 2018Global expansion: Total revenue outside the U.S. rose 41% to $184 million in the last quarter (transcript). Companies outside the U.S. are three to five years behind in cloud adoption presenting an opportunity (transcript).Increased revenue per customer: This is driven by the sale of additional modules (transcript):Source: Workday investor presentation, October 2018Low cloud penetration in Enterprise Resource Planning, Analytics, and Human Capital ManagementSource: Workday investor presentation, October 2018Increased competition amongst cloud-based enterprise applications: Competition is intensifying within Workday’s markets and its competitors have deep pockets. Workday has enjoyed an early-mover advantage within cloud-based Human Capital Management, but capital is being deployed in pursuit and competitors are catching up (see Oracle’s transition from 2016-2018 on Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Cloud Human Capital Management suites). Industry analysis revealed that cloud-based enterprise applications are a priority for Oracle and SAP, and private equity just purchased Ultimate Software to assumedly ramp up competition there as well. In Workday’s own words, “…we expect this competition to intensify in the future” (p. 9).Price competition: When the cloud-based application markets mature, and Workday’s early-mover advantage erodes, with products assumedly becoming more homogenous, Workday could face increased price competition for its products. In Workday’s own words, “As the markets for our applications mature, or as new competitors introduce new products or services that compete with ours, we may be unable to attract new customers at the same price or based on the same pricing model as we have used historically. Moreover, large customers, which are the focus of our sales efforts, may demand greater price concessions. As a result, in the future we may be required to reduce our prices, which could adversely affect our revenues, gross margin, profitability, financial position, and cash flow.” (p. 15)Workday’s high-quality customer-centric applications have benefitted from exponential demand as enterprises shifted from on-premise solutions to cloud-based applications. Whilst segmented revenue isn’t reported, Human Capital Management was the initial growth driver from 2012 but this has overwhelmingly shifted to Financial Management accompanied by add-ons like business planning and analytics.Workday has enjoyed an early-mover advantage in cloud-based applications but competition from other technology companies and private equity should intensify in the coming years led by Oracle.If Workday’s total addressable market grows by 9.1% per annum (as the company forecasts), cloud penetration continues, and Workday maintains its product leadership which appears probable because of its product development expense, Workday’s total revenue should grow by:No-one knows what this total revenue growth rate will ultimately be, so a range of estimates will be used in the valuation section.Caution is advised extrapolating high revenue growth rates because Human Capital Management revenue growth highlights the path that Financial Management revenue may take over the next 3-5 years:Note: I can’t be more precise beyond this approximation because the company doesn’t provide detailed segment information.I’ve modeled three scenarios which produce the following estimates of intrinsic value:The assumptions, which you can view within the model are as follows:Bear caseBase caseBull caseThe steady growth period from 2030 assumes a growth rate of 3%. The cost of equity dynamically re-levers the industry beta for Software (System and Application) from Damodaran so that the beta converges to 1 over time for realism.Projected total revenue by scenario is as follows:With total revenue mainly driven by the assumed subscription services growth rate:Profitability and free cash flow to equity are forecast to improve significantly in the coming years:A strong counterpoint for not investing in Workday is the projected price to earnings ratios calculated from the financial model, that utilize the current market capitalization as the numerator:You'll have to wait ten years under the bullish scenario for a P/E ratio of 9 and six years for a P/E ratio of 16. It's also possible that the base case scenario plays out, and that the stock goes nowhere for a decade because investors in 2029 won't pay more than a 16 multiple when there'd presumably be lower growth expectations amongst more mature markets.Workday could surprise to the upside, but the key risk for Workday investors, and growth investors in general, is that the future disappoints, because a lot of positive assumptions are built into the stock price. I’m highly impressed by Workday’s customer-centric focus, product excellence, and innovation. The company is well positioned to grow future revenue from its applications and add-ons as a leader in each of its markets. The base case suggests that the stock price is slightly above fair value which isn’t surprising in the current market environment. Revenue growth rates are the key bullish factor to watch moving forward, if Workday’s revenue surprises to the upside, the bull case is in play. Competition from large multinationals and private equity is the main negative factor to watch."

The company recently reported stellar third quarter results that sent its stock soaring. Despite a turbulent end to December, Workday entered the New Year after gaining more than 50% in value over the previous year.For the third quarter, revenues grew 34% over the year to $743.2 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $723.1 million. It ended the quarter with a net loss of $153.3 million, compared to a net loss of $86 million a year ago. Non-GAAP net income per share came in at $0.31, compared to $0.24 reported a year ago. The market was looking for an EPS of $0.15 per share.By segment, Subscription services revenue rose 34.7% to $624.4 million in the quarter and professional services revenue rose 29.4% to $118.8 million.Workday ended the quarter with more than 8,500 customers. During the quarter, it added names like Bank of Montreal, Glencore International, and Piedmont Airlines as its new HCM customers.For the current quarter, Workday expects to earn revenues of $775-$777 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $757.3 million. For the 2019 fiscal year, it forecast revenues of $2.808-$2.810 billion.Workday expects its fiscal 2020 subscription services revenue to come in at $3-$3.01 billion, ahead of the analysts' expectations of $2.97 billion.During the quarter, Workday continued to expand its product offerings, focusing on integrating AI and machine learning capabilities within its offerings. As part of this effort, it recently released Workday People Analytics, a new application that leverages augmented analytics powered by artificial intelligence to provide customers with key metrics. The solution will give executives, organization leaders and HR business partners a view into the most critical trends in their workforce and an understanding of the most likely drivers of those trends. It will be accompanied by explanatory narratives called stories that will highlight the most critical activities in their business.Last year, Workday had announced the $1.6 billion acquisition of Adaptive Insights. During the recently-released quarter results, Workday went live on Adaptive Insights Business Planning Cloud to help it make bigger inroads into the enterprise-level software solutions market. Additionally, it also announced an extension of the Business Planning Cloud with a strategic workforce planning solution to the Adaptive Insights solution. The feature will help organizations develop comprehensive workforce plans that will integrate with the organization's larger plan.It also announced the release of Workday 31, which includes several new features such as the skills cloud. The skills cloud is a kind of a universal skills language that helps organizations cleanse, understand, and relate job skills data so that they can tap into talent both within and outside of their organizations.Workday is clearly doing things the right way as is evident from the rising stock price and revenue growth. It was recently ranked the leader in the Fortune Future 50 companies and was ranked third by Fortune in the Best Places to Work for Women and seventh among the best places to work overall this year. The one missing link so far is profits. But given the product and its growing adoption, that should not be too far away.I would like to know from users of Workday about the product features that they find missing in Workday even now. What more can Workday offer to make sure you don't look at other cloud-based software providers for your needs?Its stock is trading at $159.68 with a market capitalization of $34.81 billion.

The jury is also still out on adoption rates of newer modules.","Workday (WDAY) shares have been much less affected in the present selloff compared to many other tech names, and we can't find insufficient reason for this, so we're not bullish on the stock as long as the present market conditions reign. We wouldn't short the stock outright, as the market is heavily oversold and could produce a significant bounce at any moment, but we're not buyers here either.Many technology stocks have sold off huge amounts from their year highs. Take the market leaders, for instance:AMZN data by YChartsBellwethers like Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB), and Netflix (NFLX) are well off their highs varying from 20% to nearly 40%. And it can be worse in tech land:NTNX data by YChartsMany of these companies have some issues. Facebook has been plagued by so many scandals, it's hard to keep track. Apple's new iPhones are not selling as many expected, bringing suppliers like Lumentum Holdings (LITE) down as well, and Ellie Mae (ELLI) is experiencing headwinds from the mortgage market.But for others, there seems to be little specific bad news to point to as a cause for significant downdraft - like Google, Nutanix (NTNX), Netflix, or even Roku (ROKU), which is experiencing a truly scary selloff and is now so heavily oversold that a bounce seems reasonable to expect.And then there is Workday, where the damage is much more limited, although the shares experienced a fairly brutal Friday.WDAY data by YChartsBut why is this company escaping the rot, at least for now? Here are some reasons:WDAY Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsRevenues have nearly five-folded in the past 5 years, and Q3 (fiscal) 2019 was another stellar quarter:We do have to point out that management noted there was some pull from Q4 into the quarter, so the results are a little inflated.But you also see that GAAP operational performance is actually not really improving, and indeed, GAAP EPS was negative $0.70, just a cent better than expected.WDAY Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsGAAP margins improved, although the GAAP operating margin deteriorated a lot this quarter, and there is a 27% point difference between GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins.The 10-Q makes clear why there has been a huge increase in share-based compensation and acquisition-related costs. Adaptive also has lower margins, and this was the first quarter where it was fully included:Cash flow:WDAY Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsCash flow was negatively impacted by one-time acquisition related payments in the quarter.The other big non-cash item is depreciation, and there is also $332.5 million of intangible assets on the balance sheet related to the acquisition of Adaptive Insights, and these will produce a steady flow of amortization (10-Q):So, there is a big gap between GAAP and non-GAAP figures, although shareholders should mostly be concerned with the share-based compensation, as of the non-cash items this is the one that leads to dilution:WDAY Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsAnd it's not just shares the company issues, but also convertible notes (from the 10-Q):Apart from the notes themselves, there are also warrants attached, so the share dilution will be substantial from share-based compensation, notes, warrants, the employee share purchase program (for restricted stock), and stock options granted.Here is Gartner's magic quadrant for Cloud HCM Suites:Workday also took the top spot in Fortune's Future 50 list, which consists of the world's most innovative and forward looking companies.Management argues that it is winning market share in the core application HCM, and one of the important factors here is word of mouth. From the Q3CC:The company enjoys a very high customer satisfaction rate, coming in at 98% during its user day WorkDay Rising.A big tailwind for the company is the ongoing movement to the cloud, but this is an uneven movement. That is, there are still lots of territories and sectors where the movement to the cloud is lagging significantly. For instance:To reduce barriers for mid-market companies, the company has introduced the Workday Launch program, which is reducing the cost of implementation, so management is explicitly positioning itself for growth here.The company added other modules and even bought a company when it arrived at the conclusion that it offered a much better solution than its own.Financial ManagementWorkday's finance module is taking off, and this isn't actually all that surprising. According to analyst Richard Davis from Cannacord, one of the biggest hangup companies have with digitalization is finance and HR not working as a team. According to CEO Aneel Bhusri, this is crucial especially for companies outside of manufacturing, where people are their main asset.From the company website:One of those segments outside manufacturing which depends crucially on their employees is the media segment, for which the company has special attention, for example the introduction last year of fixed fee packages for US media companies, which it is now taking overseas.Adaptive PlanningThe company had its own planning product, which not only functioned as a standalone product but also as a lower barrier to sell its financial product, but Workday recognized that there was much better out there. So it bought Adaptive Insights, which has now run its first full quarter under the Workday umbrella, gaining early success with large enterprise customers.Integration is ongoing. From the Q3CC:One of the additional benefits is that many companies get into cloud planning solutions before they are ready to move their finances there. That is, the planning solution isn't just a sale in its own right, it lowers the barriers for the company to sell its financial solution as well.Prism AnalyticsPrism Analytics has been a work in progress, which is why management has held back at times selling it, but that is less and less the case, and now it's one of the company's fastest-growing products with respect to ACV. There are 100 customers already, and here is company management about the progress (from the Q3CC):Professional Service AutomationProfessional Service Automation is a solution that covers the entire project lifecycle: project and resource management, time and expense tracking, project billing, revenue recognition, financial reporting, and analytics.StudentWorkday's campus solution, Student, is new, and the company is focusing on implementation at five large universities already - a promising start.Financial AidAnother new module for the higher education sector is the company's Financial Aid module to manage all kinds of programs, from federal, state, and institutional aid to private fund sources.Workday was already well represented in education with its HCM and Financial modules, but adding specialist solutions like Student and Financial Aid for the sector increases its foothold.Skills and People AnalyticsThe most recent initiatives are (from the earnings PR):So, one of the attractive elements of a SaaS platform is that it can be built out like a Swiss army knife, with ever more solutions offering ever more opportunities for cross-selling.But how is that actually going? Financial Management is the company's most important module bar HCM. From the Q3CC:This is encouraging, but there are observers who are not impressed, for eg., SA contributor Himalayas Research:And while a growth rate over 50% is strong, it's not at the same runaway growth that Workday's HCM experienced at similar stage of maturity.WDAY EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsNon-GAAP EPS is estimated at $1.27 for 2019 by analysts (up from $1.03 the previous year), resulting in a ludicrous multiple, and keep in mind that GAAP EPS is still rather negative, so this isn't yet very useful.So Workday has a terrific product, growth, innovation, and expansion opportunities, but we have some caveats:That is, we're not convinced that Workday can escape the present market selloff as relatively unharmed as it has to up till now, and unless that market selloff suddenly stops and reverses, we are not positive on the shares."
4246115,104888,2019-03-04T09:05:35-05:00,Q4 results were strong indeed.Subscription revenue was 1.3% ahead of the street.Next year revenue guidance upped 1%.Stock down over 4% after earnings vs. 0.6% same-day gain on the S&P 500.Richly valued at 115x forward earnings for about 30% growth rate.,"Workday (WDAY) reported strong 4Q results with subscription revenue 1.3% better than street and non-GAAP EPS 28% higher than consensus. Management guided FY2020 revenues to grow 35.5%, a 1% raise from prior guidance.As I wrote before, I believe that Workday is too richly valued given its lack of product diversity and slowing organic growth rate. That said, the cloud software industry has posted strong growth, is generally unaffected by tariffs, and has good revenue visibility. So, it has been a late-cycle play.1. Management expects bookings growth to be high 20%'s in the first half and low 20%'s in the second half. With bookings growth notably behind full year revenue growth of about 28%, this foreshadows an imminent slowdown in the next year or so.2. Although Adaptive Insight is an accretive acquisition, Workday said it contributed about 27M in revenues last quarter which helped add 5% yoy growth. If we strip that out to look at core organic growth, the headline growth rate of 37% for the whole company would be 32%. That's actually behind 3Q's 35% growth rate.3. With about 40% market share in HCM, it has been harder for Workday to grow in this segment. Whereas its financials segment is still only 10% of total revenue despite growing 50% yoy. Lack of new products to carry as HCM matures is a problem for multiples.Previously, I modeled a base case using management's FY2020 guidance released during 3Q earnings and +5%/-5% blue/gray-sky scenarios.Today, I will update using their raised guidance but narrow the bands to +2.5%/-2.5% offset to revenue. Given that I think core organic growth is slowing as its main product HCM matures, and with bookings growth settling in the low 20s by the end of FY2020, revenue upside surprise might be capped around 2.5%. Similarly, having heard of its good retention rates, large drop in revenue is also unlikely.My base case has operating margins of 12.6%, about 30bps higher than their guidance. This is because Workday has shown improving cost discipline with 4Q margin at 11.8% vs. street's 10.3%.Source: Himalayas Research estimatesSource: Himalayas Research estimatesDue to recent multiples expansion in other cloud peers, the base case is now marked to market with 75x forward earnings which implies about 27% downside.Source: Himalayas Research estimatesI think Workday's valuation is too high for its one-product focus unlike ServiceNow which is growing organically and has multiple product lines. Operating margins are still behind peers as Workday spends aggressively for growth.Disclaimer: All research, figures, and interpretation are provided on a best effort basis only and may be subject to error.

4226891,104608,2018-12-06T20:34:01-05:00,"Workday is still near their all-time highs, despite contracting over 20% pre-earnings during the broader market sell off.
        Q3 revenue grew 34%y/y which was ahead of consensus estimates for 30% y/y growth and an acceleration from Q2.
        With $3 billion run-rate in revenue, Workday is deserving of their premium valuation for the foreseeable future.","After falling 20% from their pre-earnings all-time highs, Workday (WDAY) has proven to withstand the market correction and has now reached new all-time highs. This is a rather impressive feat given the overall weakness in the tech market, however, WDAY has rallied over 30% since reporting earnings.WDAY remains the leading HCM company and among the best SaaS companies in the tech coverage. Despite a soft October and early November, WDAY reported another very strong beat and raise quarter with revenue growth accelerating. Their recent acquisition of Adaptive Insights gives them a strong place in the planning software market, competing directly with recent IPO, Anaplan (PLAN).In Q3, revenue grew an impressive 34% y/y, accelerating from Q2 and was ahead of consensus estimates for 30% y/y growth. Despite being the clear leader in the HCM market, WDAY continues to find ways to accelerate growth, which remains above 30%. This is very impressive for a company who just reported a run-rate revenue of nearly $3 billion.With the stock rising above their previous all-time highs due to impressive and accelerating revenue growth, the current stock price may have fully priced in continued success. Trading at ~$165, WDAY’s valuation is currently above 10x forward revenue, a valuation that may scare off many investors given the recent market turbulence and fears of a market correction/recession.WDAY recently acquired Adaptive Insights, a leading planning software player, competing directly with Anaplan (PLAN), who recently went public. Management remains very confident in software planning tools used in Financial Planning & Analysis. In Q3, WDAY saw their Financials subscription revenue grow more than 50%, a testament to both the growing power of Adaptive Insights and the software planning market.Source: Company PresentationIn Q3, revenue grew 34% y/y to $743.2 million, reaching a near $3 billion annual run-rate. Revenue for the quarter also beat consensus estimates for $723 million (30% y/y growth). Although part of the revenue beat was due to the Adaptive Insights acquisition, any company growing revenue nearly 35% at this size deserves to trade at a premium multiple.Subscription revenue of $624 million grew 35% y/y with only $4 million coming from the Adaptive Insights acquisition. Management noted the subscription revenue upside was driven by strong performance across all of their product suites. Subscription revenue is one of the key areas of growth investors look for as it helps them determine the recurring revenue visibility. With nearly 85% of revenue derived from subscription revenue, investors feel very comfortable with this revenue base, placing a higher multiple on the name.WDAY’s growth has remained very impressive for several years as they have captured a large share of the domestic market. However, their next area of growth is likely to come from international markets. International revenue is approaching 25% of overall revenue, however, is growing at a much faster rate at 47% y/y growth during Q3. With lower penetration in international markets, WDAY has a significant opportunity to maintain their 30%+ y/y growth rate for a few more years.WDAY continues to post very strong margins, with subscription gross margins of 83.5%, a slight decline from 84.5% in the year ago period. In addition, operating margins decline from 9.0% in the year ago period to 6.7% in Q3. Although margins, both gross and operating, declined y/y, part of the reason is likely due to the near term expenses related to the Adaptive Insights acquisition. Nonetheless, margins remain very healthy and strong compared to the broader tech market.WDAY also reported a healthy EPS of $0.31 compared to consensus estimates of $0.14. The significant earnings beat is largely attributed to greater than expected revenue growth in addition to margins remaining strong.Management also provided a small insight into FY20 guidance, with subscription revenue of ~$3.0b billion, representing ~ 26.5% y/y growth. Although this is a slowdown from Q3’s subscription revenue growth of 35% y/y, WDAY typically beats their guidance on almost all accounts. I would not be shocked to see subscription revenue grow closer to 30%+ y/y by the end of FY20.In addition, management noted they expect operating margins to improve 200bps y/y with the Adaptive Insights headwind to turn into tailwinds by the end of the year. Essentially, management sees WDAY’s $3 billion+ revenue growing around 35% y/y to slow down and in turn, increase their level of profitability.Management also updated their full year guidance, now expecting revenue to grow 33% y/y to $2.375-2.377 billion. The 33% y/y growth rate is extremely impressive for a company this size given many smaller companies (some of which are new to the public arena) experience a similar growth rate off a much smaller revenue base.There are few tech names that are able to consistently generate revenue growth in excess of 30% y/y and even fewer who are able to do so off a large revenue base. WDAY’s valuation remains challenging due to a lack of a clear peer group exhibiting 30% y/y revenue growth at a $3+ billion run-rate revenue base. Salesforce (CRM) is one of the few names constantly compared to WDAY because of their leadership in the cloud software space. Their growth rate and level of profitability is somewhat comparable to WDAY.Despite having a premium valuation, WDAY is deserving of this. There are very few companies in the tech space that have held up over the past few weeks during the correction. Investors remain very bullish about the growth trajectory of WDAY and I believe they have the potential to continue growing revenue 25-30% y/y for many years to come.WDAY has a significant opportunity to maintain their revenue growth rate as the international market remains relatively underpenetrated and represents nearly 25% of WDAY revenues. Growing at 47% y/y this past quarter, WDAY should be able to maintain their overall revenue growth rate and focus more on profitability in the more mature domestic market.Risks to WDAY include a slowdown in international growth or inability to generate consistent profitability. In addition, the acquisition of Adaptive Insights may also pose an integration risk. The stock price may also be under pressure if the market continues to be volatile as higher-valued tech names are typically the first ones to correct and re-rate lower.With the stock floating around all-time highs right now, it may be challenging to build a new position in this name. However, over the long-term, WDAY is a clear leader in the HCM industry. This name is one to be held in a portfolio for the long-term and look to buy off any weakness."

Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) may have started out as a HCM provider, but the company has diversified into enterprise services since and its growth continues to surpass market expectations.For the fourth quarter, Workday saw revenues grow 35% over the year to $788.6 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $777 million. Total costs and expenses grew 37% to $908.9 million, widening the net loss to $104.4 million. On an adjusted basis, though, EPS of $0.41 came in ahead of the Street's forecast of $0.32 and a stellar improvement over previous year's $0.28.By segment, subscription services revenues grew 38% to $673.5 million, ahead of the management's guidance of $663-$665 million. Professional services revenues grew 24% over the year to $115.1 million and exceeded the guidance of $112 million. Workday is seeing strong adoption of its financial management offering. During the quarter, the company saw 79 new deals for its financial offering, including four wins from Fortune 500 companies. Some of these new customers include names like Allina Health, Banner Heath, and Ryder Truck.Workday ended the year with revenues growing 32% to $2.82 billion driven by 33% growth in subscription revenues that grew to $2.39 billion. Operating loss grew to $463.3 million compared with $303.2 million reported a year ago. On an adjusted basis, net income per diluted share came in at $1.36 compared with $1.03 reported a year ago.For the current quarter, Workday expects to earn subscription revenues of $692-$694 million and professional services revenues of $120 million. That translates to a total revenue forecast of $812-$814 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $806.2 million. Workday expects to end the current year with subscription services revenues of $3.03-$3.045 billion and professional services revenues of $500 million, or total revenues of $3.53-$3.55 billion. The market was looking for revenues of $3.52 billion for the year.Last year, Workday opened up its Cloud Platform to developers and entered the PaaS market. By giving developers access to to its platform, organizations can now leverage Workday's data models and use custom apps and extensions from Workday. Apps built on the platform allow data to be retained with the customer while ensuring that they get access to Workday's security, machine learning algorithms, and statistical models.To help developers continue to build extended apps, the company recently launched the App Creator and a marketplace. The App Creator simplifies the process of building apps and brings a drag-down environment to non developers. The service will be available to users early this year. The marketplace has been designed to simplify the process of finding and accessing solutions built by the Workday ecosystem including customers, partners, and independent developers.Some of the use cases of the platform offering include a business intelligence company that developed a talent mobility app that allows employees to visualize available openings across an organization to chart their career growth, a global airline company that used the platform to build an ID badging service that simplified the process of checks and paperwork, and a financial management company created an isolated peer-to-peer feedback system for its agile development teams.

4225915,103480,2018-12-03T09:20:46-05:00,"Workday shares rocketed 10% after posting stellar Q3 results that beat Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines.Most notably, revenue growth accelerated back above 30%, thanks in part to a contribution from the newly acquired Adaptive Insights.Organic growth is tracking well too, however. The company noted that subscription revenues from its Financials suite grew 50% y/y.The company also raised its outlook for the remainder of FY19, indicating continued strength into FY20.","Though Workday (WDAY) suffered alongside the majority of the SaaS sector during a volatile October and November, it seems that the worst is behind it. The leading HCM company posted yet another beat-and-raise quarter, with a re-acceleration in growth thanks in large part to Workday's well-placed acquisition of Adaptive Insights, a planning software company that competes directly against recent IPO Anaplan (PLAN).In managing to lift its growth above 30% y/y again, Workday has proven yet again that just because it's king of the hill in the HCM space doesn't mean it has no growth opportunities left. True, HCM is a heavily competitive field now, and new, greenfield sales opportunities for Workday are largely limited - but the company has shown a surprising agility at pivoting into new products at just the right time.Workday's investment into financials software is now proving to be an incredibly smart move. Workday's CEO called out that this quarter's Financials subscription revenue grew more than 50% y/y, far faster than total top-line growth. The addition of planning tools that can be used by executives and FP&A (financial planning and analysis) teams alike through Adaptive Insights is another natural extension of the Workday Financials brand, not to mention a huge cross-selling opportunity into Adaptive Insights' installed base. Yes, Workday is large, but it's not slowing down.In recognition of a brightened growth outlook for the company, Workday also lifted its full-year outlook for subscription revenues to 33% y/y growth to $2.375-$2.377 billion in revenues. It's important to note that Workday is about 10x the size of some recent IPOs that are showing a similar growth rate. Though Workday, along with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), constitute the ""blue chip"" of the cloud software sector, it's still exhibiting startup-like growth thanks to its innovation in new product categories.Naturally, investors took Kindly to this quarter's beat and guidance lift. Shares of Workday rose nearly 10% in after-hours trading after announcing Q3 results, helping to reverse virtually all the decline that Workday suffered over the past two months.WDAY data by YChartsCan Workday keep rallying? In my view, Workday is a stock for the long haul, a viewpoint I expressed last quarter. Yes, it's true that the company carries a rich valuation, and especially after the recent sector-wide pullback, there are far cheaper names to invest in. However, Workday has become a cornerstone of two giant categories of cloud software: HCM and Financials. It keeps finding ways to extend its considerable brand into new categories, and like Salesforce, Workday is one of the companies that can continue at a 20-30% y/y growth clip for the foreseeable future. In short, Workday's premium valuation is a well-deserved one (and notice from the chart above that it has consistently traded at a double-digit revenue valuation, and it's currently not far from its year-to-date average).Workday is also immensely profitable - unlike some fast-growing tech titans like Snap (SNAP) that continue to show hemorrhaging losses. Folding in Adaptive Insights' loss profile into Workday's financials may impact near-term margins and cash flow, but over the long haul, Workday has also consistently generated strong free cash flows and margins. Workday's relatively strong financial position - and clear path to breakeven GAAP profits - should also give investors comfort during volatile times when loss-leading, high-risk tech stocks are being shunned.Stay long on Workday - this rebound will turn into a full-blown rally in 2019.Here's a glance at Workday's third-quarter results:Figure 1. Workday 3Q18 resultsSource: Workday investor relationsRevenues grew 34% y/y to $743.2 million, far surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $723.0 million (+30% y/y) by a wide four-point margin. Workday's CFO, Robynne Cisco, also quantified the portion of the outperformance that traced back to Adaptive Insights on the Q3 earnings call:Regardless, it's fairly clear that it's not just Adaptive Insights alone contributing to the huge beat. The company generates quarterly revenues in the mid-$30 million range, which in its entirety accounts for only five points of growth for Workday. Wall Street was already expecting Adaptive Insight's revenues to be folded in, so a good portion of the beat to consensus estimates must have been sourced organically.The company also achieved strong international growth, which is key at a time when Workday is hitting a saturation point among its domestic clients. International revenues jumped 47% y/y and represented 23% of Workday's overall revenues. Alongside new product extensions, Workday's relatively low penetration in overseas markets also presents another important growth channel.Workday also retained its best-in-class gross margins. Subscription gross margins clocked in at 83.5%, essentially flat to last year's 84.5% subscription gross margins, and impacted again by Adaptive Insights' contribution.Though Workday's pro forma operating margins slipped 230bps to 6.7% (versus 9.0% in the year-ago quarter), Adaptive Insights presented a very much expected near-term headwind. Stronger-than-expected top line growth, however, still allowed Workday to churn out $), Adaptive Insights presented a very much expected near-term headwind. Stronger-than-expected top line growth, however, still allowed Workday to churn out $0.31 in pro forma EPS, more than double Wall Street's expectations of $0.14.On the Q3 earnings call, CFO Robynne Cisco also gave investors an early peek at the company's expectations for the next fiscal year. Per Cisco's prepared remarks:The midpoint of this range would represent 26.5% y/y growth over this year's expected subscription revenues - again, a robust growth rate for a company that is at a $3 billion revenue scale.It's also worth noting that Workday is expecting a 200 bps improvement in pro forma operating margins in FY20 relative to FY19. The company expects margin headwinds from Adaptive Insights to normalize in the tail end of the year.Workday's third-quarter results suggest full steam ahead. Even so, there are some cautions that investors should be wary of. The most pressing one at this juncture is fourth-quarter results: given the strength in Q3, it's likely that Workday might see a tapering off in the fourth quarter, especially as the company acknowledged that some deals originally expected to close in Q4 were instead pulled into Q3.Analysts addressed this point directly on the Q&A portion of Workday's earnings call, and sales head Chano Fernandez acknowledged that there had indeed been a pull-in of demand. At the same time, however, he noted that ""we're positive about the outlook"" and that ""we have similar levels of pipeline coverage as of last year,"" suggesting that Q4 may still be strong regardless.The other major risk is Workday's profitability levels in FY20. Workday has often enjoyed a superior reputation relative to Salesforce thanks to its premium margin profile, but if the recovery from the Adaptive Insights acquisition takes longer than expected, and if Workday doesn't achieve the 200 bps operating margin improvement that it promised, the company could see its valuation compress down closer to Salesforce's. For years, Workday has maintained a two-turn premium or larger (see chart below), but this gap could close if Workday's profitability begins to turn sour.WDAY EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsAll in all, however, investors should be pleased with Workday's direction. It's executing well on the sales front, while keeping its product portfolio broad and positioning itself for growth overseas. There's no doubt that Workday still merits a long-term bullish position in any tech portfolio."
4226409,104888,2018-12-05T07:51:37-05:00,"Workday reported great results for Q3. Subscription revenues were 2% higher than estimates.Despite strong win rates, some demand might have pulled forward from Q4 and thus guidance for Q4 and next year implies some deceleration.HCM cloud adoption doesn't seem to translate to financials management, which leaves Workday short of product diversity.Competition is becoming more intense as the industry matures and may slow adoption rates.Currently trades richly at over 100x forward earnings for 30% EPS forward growth rate.","Workday (WDAY) delivered outstanding results on its third quarter with subscriptions revenues beating street estimates and its guidance by 2%. Operating margin of 6.7% was 270 bps higher than guidance. Win rates in its Human Capital Management (""HCM"") segment have continued to be strong, and its financial management product segment was highlighted this quarter to have grown 50% from over a year ago. However, its disclosure regarding financials segment performance has been inconsistent, appearing to highlight selectively when the quarter performance was strong.But despite its strong results, management's guidance for the fourth quarter and next year implied that there might be some slowdown. The company expects subscription revenue in Q4 to be up 6.3% sequentially, which is a deceleration from the third quarter which grew 10.4% sequentially. On the earnings call, Workday mentioned that there was some demand that was pulled forward into Q3 from Q4. The professional services segment was even guided to drop -5.7% quarter over quarter.I rate Workday as a Sell as valuation is too high compared with peers. Its growth is strong but not compelling enough. In a base case scenario, I see 37% downside.Workday offers cloud-based solutions to mostly large enterprises via two segments - human capital management (""HCM"") and financial management. Recently, the company has shifted towards targeting mid-market, which I interpret that it is seeking to find growth elsewhere as adoption rate with Fortune 500 companies slows. Mid-sized companies have different needs from the large enterprises, and the costs of developing solutions may not necessarily be shared. So, I don't expect product development expenses to materially go down.Reluctance in customers to shift financials into cloudAccording to participant information gathered at this year's Rising event in Las Vegas, only 9 (8 in 2017) out of the Fortune 500 companies expressed interest in moving financials to the cloud. The connection between cross-selling HCM with financials has still been elusive, although it is heavily invested into and promoted by Workday. Given that an estimate of more than half of F500 companies have already adopted cloud HCM, the lagging adopters are in more conservative industries, such as public sector and banks, that don't necessarily have the urgency to do so. That said, financial deal wins in Q3 might have come from midmarket instead.Lack of consistency in the disclosures regarding this segment leads me to think adoption here is more sporadic.The industry is getting more and more competitiveWorkday is no doubt a leader in HCM, but it faces competition from multiple vendors. I believe HCM adoption has matured with more than half of the F500 companies already onboard.Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) competes with Workday on price point, while the latter still maintains a better overall win rate as I think successful deal closure depends also on culture fit rather than just on price. But it does force price concessions from Workday, and Oracle is still gaining incremental traction, though.SAP (NYSE:SAP) is lacking on the feature front but has clear advantages with global/multinational companies as geographical integration and global support become important. As with Oracle, SAP is also gaining some share.ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is leading software vendor of IT helpdesk solutions and now is considered a cloud-based workflow management platform. On the most recent earnings call, the company mentioned that it aims to connect different software and cloud, and it does not want to directly compete with Workday on HCM or Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) on CSM. But the company has successfully branched out into PaaS/SaaS by offering its own HCM/CSM solutions. Both sales and earnings growth are strong, but margins are well ahead of Workday.First, I want to start off and say that Workday has generally been able to beat its guidance. For the past couple of years, annual guidance on average proved to be 6% more conservative than actual figures. But this strength is common with most major cloud companies.So, I model three cases here. 1) The base case is US$3bn in subscription revenue as guided, and 12.4% operating margin (vs. 12% guidance). 2) In the blue-sky scenario, I model +5% revenues over base and an expanded margin of 14.4%. 3) The gray-sky scenario will be -5% revenues under base and a lower margin of 10.9%. The rationale behind is that a higher revenue will produce a better margin as some costs are less sensitive to revenues and vice versa.The base case is a 30.6% increase in adjusted EPS and 24.7% growth in revenues. But I don't think you would want to pay 100x forward earnings for 30% growth rate. Plus, this implies revenue growth decelerating and only operating leverage improvement to make up for it.The blue-sky scenario is the upside risk if revenue is 5% more than guidance. An operating margin of 14.4% is quite generous. I think, given where the stock is trading post-earnings, I think this is the scenario the markets are pricing in - perfection. But there a lot of execution risks throughout the year, namely from competitor wins vs. Workday. And most importantly, as they continue to grow into the cloud market, there is less and less demand left since what remains are adopters which are not at all incentivized to utilize clouds. That will put pressure onto multiples as well as the year goes on.The gray-sky scenario is the downside risk if revenue is 5% below guidance and operating margin shrinks to 10.9%. This will probably happen if we see tough competition and/or slowdown in the broader economy.Source: Himalayas Research estimatesSource: Company, Himalayas Research estimatesGAAP Income StatementSource: CompanyShare-Based Compensation is >20% of Revenues, Difficult to Turn a GAAP ProfitEven though, on a non-GAAP basis, Workday is turning a profit, it is important to be aware that its share-based compensation expenses are adjusted out of its non-GAAP earnings. In the third quarter, that stood at 28% of revenues! Typically, it's in the low-20s percentage range. If we count stock compensations as an expense (it really should be), I don't believe Workday will be profitable by next year. But, at some point, high growth tech firms will begin to mature as will their industry, and growth rates will slow, meaning that share prices will begin to plateau. Share-based incentives work really well to compensate staff in ways other than cash, which companies obviously don't have a lot of in their nascent stages, but it can become an issue once the share price stops going up. Investors will not continually accept dilution if they cannot be rewarded with further capital appreciation. Staff would also lean towards cash compensation.Now, street values these cloud companies typically on non-GAAP earnings because these are growth companies, and it's clearer to look at underlying business fundamentals this way. But, as I said earlier, share-based compensations are in fact expenses, and they will at some point become relevant to the bottom line or cash flow. In my model, I assume the share-based compensation is fixed at 22% of revenues (Q3: 28%). As you can see, even if they beat revenues and margins (in the blue-sky scenario), they will still be making a loss (-0.64 per share).Note: For example, in FY2020, we get share-based compensation by share of 3.08 by applying 22% to revenues (FY2020E: 3,503m) and dividing by 250m shares.Source: Himalayas Research estimatesWorkday's Valuation vs. PeersSource: Koyfin, Himalayas ResearchWorkday's expected sales growth is somewhere between CRM and NOW, but its EBIT margin is the lowest. This is the biggest concern to profitability. They are chasing top-line growth with little cost discipline. I think a 60x forward earnings is more appropriate, so that it trades along the lines with CRM and NOW. So, in other words, I think if the company is able to meet guidance, I think it should only trade at 60x, which is about 37% downside. On the other hand, if they beat guidance and market continues to value it at 100x (albeit unlikely), then we have about 25% upside. CRM also traded at 73x in January before contracting to 56x now even as their earnings grew.Source: Himalayas Research estimatesWhy Sell a Stock with Record Earnings at Record Highs?Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) also reached an all-time high as it beat earnings in September, and both its sales and earnings were at record highs, yet it's still trading 10% below its peak. Its valuation multiples contracted. And I think this will apply to Workday.Outperformance in HCM and financials; higher win rates vs. its competitors.Faster-than-expected adoption rates for its cloud-based solutions.Becomes a target for acquisition.I regard Workday as a high risk sell with 37% downside in my base case scenario. Despite reporting great results for the last quarter, I think markets are overly optimistic about its continued growth potential as I see headwinds in its financials segment, while HCM is maturing and adoption rate might begin to slow. Competition is becoming more intense with Oracle, SAP, and ServiceNow, which are offering solutions in the same space. Workday's valuations are also very high compared with peers of similar growth profile, while its margins are lower, thus I think contraction of multiples is likely. For a pair trade, one could short Workday and long ServiceNow.Disclaimer: All research, figures and interpretation are provided on a best effort basis only and may be subject to error.

4237461,103231,2019-02-01T10:41:31-05:00,"The adoption of Adaptive Insights by a large amount of customers is a confirmation of the growth potential of Workday’s financial management segment.Unfortunately, strong revenue growth has not been able to move the bottom line due to a high operating leverage.Although Workday's cloud applications promise to keep revenue on a growth spurt, the premium seems somewhat high from an industry perspective.","After a few turbulent months, it seems that the sentiment towards companies in the technology sector has begun to improve. In the case of Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY), we see that short interest has declined to stand at 5%, a historically low level. Part of the change in sentiment towards Workday can be attributed to expectations in IT spending, which the research firm Gartner expects to continue growing in 2019 despite fears of a contraction in the global economy. For its part, the software applications industry expects that for this year the cloud software will grow more than 20%, maintaining its current pace.Although we see the increasing adoption of Workday's financial management platform as a confirmation of the investment thesis, we believe that in comparative terms, WDAY lacks some fundamentals that position it a little below companies in the software application industry.Workday delivered very impressive third-quarter results, apparent from the 18% increase in share price since the results were declared on late November 2018. The company experienced an acceleration in net new ACV growth, with strong Human Capital Management business together with a good Financial Management suite of applications.Data by YChartsThe company derives its revenue mainly from subscription services and professional services. During this quarter, 84% of the total revenue constituted of subscription revenue, earned mainly from medium and large enterprises. Workday's strong performance was apparent from the 35% increase in subscription services, as there was an increased number of customer contracts compared to the prior-year period.On the other hand, professional services managed well with a 29% increase in the last quarter due to the deployment and integration of services for a greater number of customers than in the prior-year period. With increasing services for the partner firms, subscription services revenues continue to increase, while professional service revenues, as a percentage of total revenues, are expected to decline over time.Regarding the Financial Management segment, the recent acquisition of Adaptive Insights has shown an accelerated adoption with large companies migrating from Workday Planning to Adaptive, as part of their integration plans. The unification of both platforms further extends the scope and benefits of this segment, extending the applications to branches such as planning, execution, and analysis.Source: Data provided by YChartsIn terms of relative growth, we see that Workday is positioned above peer companies from a revenue perspective. The company continues to maintain growth very close to its historical average of three years, which is more noticeable as quarterly revenues approach the billion mark.However, this growth at the top has not been able to translate to a positive net income. Workday has been characterized by a lack of positive EPS given the high investment in marketing and R&D necessary to maintain its high growth. We see that the objective of the executives continues pointing to a strategy that prioritizes the expansion of their markets and the development of their financial management applications, instead of generating a positive EPS.Given that Workday faces competition from two major competitors such as Oracle Corp. (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), efforts to penetrate the Enterprise Resource Management (ERP) market have created costs that have caused a dent in its financial results.Workday witnessed an increase of around 40% in operating expenses in the third quarter from the prior-year period due to an increase in employee-related costs driven by higher headcount, outside services expenses, depreciation and amortization expenses, facility and IT-related expenses, and third-party costs for hardware maintenance and data center capacity.The acquisition of Adaptive Insights, Inc., including one-time transaction and integration-related costs, plays a significant role in these increases. On the other hand, the operating margin declined to 6.7% in this quarter, due to higher operating expenses from the acquisition, counterbalanced by higher revenues.Source: Data provided by YChartsIn comparative terms, we see that although Workday's gross margins are at industry levels, in terms of operating and net income, the company falls below peer companies such as Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU). Despite this lack of profit, the company has managed to generate a positive operating cash flow in recent years, thanks to its stock compensation program.Looking closely at the cash flow, Workday reported a $1.3 billion cash outflow from investing activities as a result of the acquisition in this quarter. The company is expecting capital expenditures related to the construction of the development center project, which will be approximately $200 million for fiscal 2019. Cash outflow from financing activities was $3 million in this quarter, mainly due to the proceeds from the issuance of common stock from employee equity plans.The company witnessed a decrease of $49 million from the prior-year period to $59 million in free cash flow segment due to increases in capital expenditures and higher operating expenses driven by increased headcount and acquisition, partially offset by increases in sales and the related cash collections. Workday does not intend to pay any dividend in the near future.We see that management's focal areas are investments in long-term growth initiatives, while delivering positive operating and cash flow margins over the long term. Operating cash flow guidance for fiscal-year 2019 is being maintained at $550 million. $400 million in capex will be evenly split between owned real estate projects and all other capex.In our view, a revenue mix that is increasingly leaning towards its financial management applications will keep revenue growth at a double-digit rate over the next five years. On the other hand, we see that the operational leverage from its sales and marketing strategies, and research and development costs, continues to cause profitability problems. This lack of profitability has made the company seem less attractive compared to peer companies.In terms of valuation, we see that the sustained growth of revenues has placed a high premium on the value of the shares, positioning it alongside companies that show similar growth rates such as ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Atlassian (NASDAQ:TEAM).Source: Data provided by YChartsWhile Workday's business model based on cloud applications and Data-as-a-Service has positioned the company as a leader in the ERP space, we believe that from an industry perspective, the company lacks some fundamentals that make us believe that the shares are worth their elevated premium."
4212894,21815,2018-10-19T19:56:29-04:00,"Acquisitions and new modules have expanded the TAM and will keep revenues growing for some time to come.While the company is non-GAAP profitable, there isn't yet much operational leverage, and share-based compensation is huge.We don't see much reason for multiple expansion either. In fact, multiples could contract in times of market turbulence when sentiment turns against high-flyers.So, we're sitting on the fence on this one until the storm in tech shares abates.","Workday (WDAY) is one of these SaaS cloud platform companies that seem to have endless growth opportunities as their prime application still has significant runway, and they can add additional applications to their platform.It's therefore no surprise that Workday (and similar stocks) has and continues to produce big returns for investors, despite often steep (or even very steep) valuations.But we see a lot of volatility and price swings entering tech names, so while the fundamentals we'll discuss below are fine, there are other considerations for timing a buying decision.Very little seems to be able to go wrong with the main headwind for investors is simply a change in sentiment knocking the valuation multiples a little lower from time to time.It seems that we just had such a period:But as you can see, stocks like this tend to behave like beach-balls held under water. As soon as the downward pressure subsides, they tend to shoot higher again.Of course, it's always possible that these companies produce a disappointing quarter as well, but the ones we follow, like Workday, this tends to be a rare event.Our overview shows a steady revenue growth, but the years of hypergrowth are clearly behind us.WDAY Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThat is of course not surprising for a company with sales of $2.4B (past 12 months) and a market cap of $27.5B. You also see that, while there is some operational improvement, the company is still making substantial losses, at least in GAAP.The company started as an HCM (human capital management) outfit, and we are actually a little surprised that this still is 90% of their business, and that market seems theirs with 35% of the Fortune 500 and a whopping 50% of Fortune 50 as their customer already. Management is confident to land 50% of the Fortune 500 in the next couple of years.So, they are looking beyond HCM for additional growth, and the opportunities are considerable, given that HCM is only 25% of their TAM. The expansion of the TAM comes from adding modules and functionality to their core HCM product, like:The cloud platform is still under development and is in limited availability still. Their Financial Management product is taking off, with 60% customer growth in Q2 (y/y) arriving at 530 customers, 8 of the Fortune 500 companies.There are other areas of expansion at which management is looking like HR service delivery, but for now, they have partners in that area.The company bought Adaptive (which closed on August 1), a financial and operational planning solution for $1.6B. Workday has its own planning solution, but that's focused on workforce planning and (after some deliberations) is going to sunset this in favor of Adaptive's solution.Then, they will spend the next 12-18 months integrating it into the Workday platform, in stages. An additional benefit is that Adaptive contains a modeling engine, which the Workday platform lacked.Apart from that, the company kept on selling Adaptive as a separate solution as it had considerable market success on its own. The acquisition provides other benefits:If it is sold as a standalone solution, the salespeople of Adaptive will do the selling. If it's part of a larger ERP type deal, then Workday reps will take the lead, giving them an opportunity to sell other Workday solutions. Here is management (Q2CC):And with regard to being a more complete offering with Adaptive, here is management again (Q2CC):Management clearly believes that adding a top-notch planning solution will accelerate demand for some of the core financial solutions as well. It's simply one more way to get a foot through the door.This land and expand strategy is pretty attractive (Q2CC):Adaptive itself is also still evolving:International is also a growth opportunity as the market is three to four years behind the US in terms of adoption, but things are really starting to pick up. From the 10-Q:From the 10-Q:Subscriptions grew at 30% while professional services grew 17% in Q2 (y/y). Unearned revenue grew 21% to almost $1.5B.Comps were rather challenging in H1 but will be a little easier in H2, and this will show up in a reacceleration in ACV (average customer value), but not in backlog as this is already a huge number ($5.5B).WDAY Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsThere has been a fairly steady margin improvement in both gross and (GAAP) operating margins, although Q2 professional services experienced some margin decline (due to the yearly Annual Global Partner Conference and annual employee compensation) which resulted in gross margins a tad lower at 74% (non-GAAP).There is a huge gap between GAAP and non-GAAP operating margins. The latter is a positive 10.1%. How operational costs are distributed and the large difference between GAAP and non-GAAP metrics is shown here, from the 10-Q:Non-GAAP operating metrics are growing:That is, non-GAAP operating costs grow a little less than revenues with all the leverage coming from sales and marketing.Losses are much less serious if a company doesn't bleed cash, which isn't the case:WDAY Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsHowever, the company depends on a really hefty dose of share-based compensation ($147M in the quarter 21.8% of revenue) to keep the cash flowing in:WDAY Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsNo wonder the share count has been steadily rising. The company also has $1,177M in notes outstanding. The company has actually two classes of shares outstanding, class A and class B, with the latter having 10x the voting power. From the 10-Q:There are also RSUs (restricted stock units). From the 10-Q:WDAY data by YChartsThe shares aren't exactly cheap, but that's par for the course for these types of companies. The company is profitable on a non-GAAP basis and expected to achieve $1.08 in EPS this fiscal year rising to $1.49 in fiscal 2020.We see little reason for multiple expansion. In fact, in the present climate, where market fear is setting in, multiples could contract a little. That is, investors need revenue growth and operational leverage to produce gains.We think revenue growth will likely continue at this 25%-30% pace for quite some time. The Adaptive acquisition has provided new opportunities here to keep the show on the road.All the present operational leverage is coming from sales, and how this develops in the future depends on what they need for further international expansion. Investment in product development is still rather substantial.The company produces considerable cash although this is a result of a really very substantial share-based compensation account exceeding 20% of revenue. It doesn't look like cash generation will be directed towards share buybacks in the near future.So, we so see a more modest upside path for the shares, roughly at the pace of revenue growth as substantial operational leverage hasn't materialized yet, and there is some headwind from the large amount of share-based compensation and resulting dilution.Yet, we don't think now is the time to buy shares, given the market volatility which could easily get worse. It's one to keep on the watch list for purchases."

The growth is expected to be driven by the need to replace legacy systems with improved human capital management platforms. Recently, SaaS-based HCM services provider Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) announced its quarterly results that continued to outpace market expectations.For the second quarter, revenues grew 28% over the year to $671.7 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $663.1 million. EPS of $0.31 also was ahead of the market's forecast of $0.26 for the quarter. Previous coverage is available here.By segment, subscription revenues grew 30% to $565.7 million and professional services revenues grew 17% to $106 million. The market was looking for subscription revenues of $559 million for the quarter.For the current quarter, Workday expects to earn revenues of $721-$723 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $691.2 million. For the full 2019 fiscal year, Workday expects revenues of $2.765-$2.772 billion, ahead of the $2.704 billion consensus.The biggest news for Workday during the quarter was its $1.6 billion acquisition of Adaptive Insights. Over the past few years, Workday has been diversifying beyond human capital management solutions to other cloud-based enterprise offerings. The acquisition of Adaptive Insights is a big step toward that goal. Adaptive Insights is a leading cloud-based provider of financial planning services. In May this year, Adaptive Insights had filed to go public and had disclosed revenues of $106.5 million in fiscal 2018 with a loss of $42.7 million. Workday plans to integrate the Adaptive Insights Business Planning Cloud with its suite of applications for finance and HR to deliver a solution that will help organizations plan, execute, and analyze performance better.This is not the only acquisition that Workday made this year. In June this year, it had also announced the acquisition of Rallyteam's talent. San Francisco-based Rallyteam's service helps companies keep talented employees by matching their skills with challenging opportunities in-house. Workday plans to leverage Rallyteam's capabilities to enhance its machine learning offerings. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.Additionally, in January, Workday had acquired SkipFlag, an enterprise knowledge management service provider. SkipFlag was founded by LinkedIn alumni and is known to enable the integration of various data feeds with machine learning capabilities to build a knowledge map across the organization. Workday plans to use SkipFlag's deep learning capabilities across its offering to improve the products available to its customers. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.Workday is clearly building up its arsenal to ensure that it can offer all the right tools that are needed for enterprise resource management. I would like to know how willing are you, as users, to exchange your existing, and in some cases, legacy solutions for Workday's offerings? What is it that Workday needs to add more to get you to switch?Its stock is trading at $142.21 with a market capitalization of $30.6 billion. It had touched a 52-week high of $157.12 last month. It has recovered from the 52-week low of $95.35 it had fallen to in December last year."
4203315,103231,2018-08-30T22:35:36-04:00,"Despite competition from established companies such as Oracle and SAP, Workday's cloud-based applications have seen gains of 20%.Workday’s ability to deliver innovation to customers without disrupting normal operations has made it a leader in the HCM market.However, Workday's strategy of heavy investment in product development and marketing has had an effect on profits since its inception.","On June 11, Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY) made an announcement that it had reached a definitive agreement for the acquisition of financial modeling and planning software firm Adaptive Insights for $1.55 billion in cash. The acquisition draws funding from Workday’s existing $3.4 billion cash reserves and short-term investment capital. Although the purchase price appears high, CEO Aneel Bhusri predicts that Adaptive Insights’ modeling and analytics functions will accelerate Workday Planning’s product roadmap by two to three years. This could lead to an increase in the adoption of Workday’s financial management solutions. These cover a variety of functions but are generally used by companies for accounting and reporting purposes.Workday currently generates a substantial majority of subscription service revenue from its human capital management (HCM) application. However, financial management applications have displayed strong growth in recent quarters.During the fourth quarter of 2017, the company acquired 58 new core financial management customers. This figure showed an increase of 45% in comparison to the previous year, and included in the additions are two Fortune 500 customers, including a Fortune 100 company. During the first quarter of 2018, Workday continued to expand the depth and breadth of its cloud-based finance system by offering Workday Prism Analytics, Workday Benchmarking and Workday Planning. This expansion has led to new relationships formed with companies, including Sprouts Farmers Market, Rivera, and Race Truck Petroleum, which is one of the largest private companies in the US.As a result of this success, the company has further expanded into financial and supply-chain planning and management software. We believe these applications are among the best when switching costs for back-office business software. These gains, when combined with the momentum generated from fiscal 2018, demonstrate the growing traction of financial management applications in both medium and large companies.Source: Extracted from the Workday website.Workday has continued to increase its share in the burgeoning cloud-based financial management market. The company achieved this gain despite heavy competition from a pair of large enterprise resource planning (ERP) vendors Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and SAP (NYSE: SAP). Due to the initial success of its human capital management software, Workday is broadening its portfolio while simultaneously targeting the world’s largest enterprises.Cloud migration for financial management software is still at a fairly early stage for many global organizations. However, we believe Workday’s cloud-native applications allow it to compete more effectively with legacy vendors such as Oracle and SAP, both of whom are also in a race to try and transfer customers to more modern solutions.While Workday’s share in the wider, fragmented ERP market is dwarfed by Oracle and SAP, its share in the cloud ERP market is fast approaching 20%, according to a recent report by Research and Markets, and we predict that the majority of new ERP spending will flow into cloud-based solutions. Oracle and SAP will fight tooth and nail to retain their largest customers, but we believe Workday will soon become a force to be reckoned with as the cloud land grab rages on for the next several years.The company’s growing influence in the HCM market is observable from Gartner’s August 2018 ""Magic Quadrant for Cloud HCM Suites for Midmarket and Large Enterprises"" report which considers Workday to be in the ""Leaders"" quadrant. The company’s impressive client list includes Citigroup Management Corporation, Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Humana (NYSE:HUM). Workday’s diversified product portfolio continues to yield a steady influx of customers. We believe that the company’s high customer satisfaction rate bodes well for the success of its long-term business model. In the fourth quarter, the company achieved an industry-leading 98% customer satisfaction rating, even surpassing its target of 95%.Source: Quadrant extracted from Workday website.Workday currently has more than 2,100 customers, with the majority being medium-sized, large, and global organizations. The company has achieved this leading position through its innovative and adaptable technology, and commitment to customer satisfaction. Typically, Workday offers applications to customers on an enterprise-wide subscription basis of three years or longer, and with subscription fees that are determined by the size of its customer’s workforce. We believe that these partnerships represent a solid customer base that more than likely will continue in the long term.Additionally, an important principle for Workday is to provide innovation in its products. The company delivers major feature releases twice per year, and minor feature releases are available as weekly updates, causing minimal downtime disruption for customers. This ensures that all Workday customers use the same versions at all times. The customers also benefit from the most up to date technologies without the burden of large upgrade costs typically associated with traditional on-premises software. The company also provides an open, standards-based web application interface, and pre-built packaged integrations and connectors. This approach substantially reduces the need for customers to invest in a wide range of IT infrastructure, significantly reducing costs and complexity.We think that this culture centered on the customers’ success and satisfaction is a major contributing factor in Workday's success. It determines not only the initial reasons why large companies migrate to Workday, but also why they maintain a long-term relationship. Furthermore, we think that the experience and expertise required to achieve success in the areas of financial management, HCM, and analysis, are lacking in some competitors. New entrants often cannot invest the necessary capital to achieve the high standards and global reach demonstrated by Workday.Workday has incurred significant losses in each period since its inception in 2005, and we do not expect the company to be profitable on a GAAP basis for the foreseeable future. Despite that, the company holds a strong revenue growth of 36% over the past two years, and a wide gross profit margin above 70%, its operating expenses are dragging down these results.For the fiscal year 2018, Workday reported product development expenses of $658 million, compared to $495 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $163 million or 33%. The increase was primarily due to increases of $180 million in employee-related costs due to higher staff numbers. These high expenses are part of the company’s growth plan as it tries to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.Similarly, as a core part of Workday strategy, sales and marketing will continue to increase as the company develops an ecosystem of partners with software and technology partners, consulting and implementation services providers, and business process outsourcing partners, seeking to expand its domestic and international presence in the market. For fiscal 2018, Workday reported expenses in sales and marketing for $578 million, compared to $476 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of $102 million or 21%.Source: Data extracted from Workday’s Annual report 2018.Moreover, competition in the HCM and financial management software market is seeing an increase, which could lead to pricing pressure and affect Workday’s margins. The chief risk facing Workday is the presence of two large, incumbent vendors serving the markets that Workday is attempting to penetrate. We believe Workday has the advantage of stability and maturity over competitors including Oracle and SAP. These companies can rely on a large customer base that will probably elevate their cloud-based solutions. This could lead the company to resort to competitive pricing in order to maintain and capture further market share from these larger competitors.We expect the revenue mix to continually tilt toward its financial products, which we estimate contribute just over 10% of subscription revenue today. We believe this product carries a meaningful amount of pricing power, which will help drive gross margin accretion over the course of our explicit forecast period toward 80%.WDAY EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsIn terms of the stock’s valuation, we think that Workday’s sales ratios have reached more stable levels from the record high seen after its IPO. We see that the contraction of the EV to Revenues, from stellar 30x to a current 13.7x, has been on a par with the decrease in Workday's growth rate, which has gone from 75% after its IPO to a current 29%.Looking forward, we modeled compound annual revenue growth at 20% over a 10-year-period, yielding an annual revenue above $10 billion by 2027. We expect contributions from Workday’s financials, learning, and other products to prop up growth for several years, which will give stocks a boost in the long term.In contrast, its lack of profitability remains a concern, especially when compared to similar companies in the SaaS industry like Salesforce.com, Inc. (NYSE: CRM) and Oracle. However, as revenue continues to grow at a faster pace than the industry, the stock price still has room for further expansion."

Since that time, the company’s relative valuation has been more or less flat.Source: Ycharts.comIn the light of revenue variation of popular Peter Lynch's earnings line for the projection of intrinsic per share values of the company, the current Workday's share price seems to provide an attractive long-run entry point. According to my model assuming 27 percent annual revenue growth decreasing by 2 percent every year going on, an annual equity dilution factor of 5 percent, and an average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 11x, the company's intrinsic value by the end of 2022 is forecasted to stand at roughly US$257 per share. This intrinsic value estimate implies more than 18 percent total annualized rate of return upside potential. Should the price-to-sales multiple stand at a rather smaller value of about 7x, the company's shares could still offer a positive annualized upside potential of approximately 5 percent.Source: Author's own Excel modelTo sum up, Workday is an outstanding company with still a lot of start-up characteristics which suggest a lot of the company’s growth potential has still not been realized. Even though the company does not generate any free cash flow yet, its revenue growth has been remarkable.Author's note: To bring similar articles to your attention, please consider subscription of my SA feed by clicking on the ''Follow'' button at the top of this page.Disclaimer: Please note that this article has an informative purpose, expresses its author's opinion, and does not constitute investment recommendation or advice.

4209925,101421,2018-10-04T14:40:27-04:00,Workday has participated in the current financing round for enterprise software startup pymetrics.Pymetrics is developing an AI-driven recruitment software system for enterprises.The deal is indicative of an increased investment pace in companies that can build applications on top of WDAY's open enterprise platform.,"Workday (WDAY) has made an investment in pymetrics’ recent Series B funding round of $40 million.Pymetrics is developing AI-powered human resources software for the enterprise market.WDAY launched a $250 million investment fund earlier in 2018 as the firm ramps up its efforts to jumpstart third-party application development efforts on its recently-opened enterprise software platform.New York-based pymetrics was founded in 2013 to help companies hire the right employees by leverage neuroscience and AI to analyze applicants.Management is headed by Co-Founder and CEO Frida Polli, who was previously Postdoctoral Fellow, Brain & Cognitive Sciences Department at MIT.Pymetrics’ primary offerings include Neuroscience Games, Customized AI, Bias-free algorithms, and Common application.Major pymetrics company customers include:According to a market research report by Grand View Research, the global human resources software market is projected to surpass $10 billion by 2022.The main driver for this expected growth is the increasing adoption of cloud technologies, such as Software as a Service (SaaS).North America is projected to be the largest market for AI-driven solutions due to substantial growth across the service sector.Major competitive vendors that provide human resources software include:Along with Workday, other investors in the current round included lead investor and growth equity firm General Atlantic, new investor Salesforce Ventures (CRM), and existing venture capital firm investors Khosla Ventures and Jazz Venture Partners.Investment valuation wasn’t disclosed. Including the current funding, pymetrics is believed to have raised $58 million in investment since inception.WDAY invested in pymetrics to assist the firm in its international expansion efforts and continued product development.As pymetrics CEO and co-founder Dr. Frida Polli stated in the deal announcement,Workday has been an increasingly active corporate investor in technology startups, investing in at least 12 company financings since 2013.The graphic below shows a sample of its recent investment history by various metrics (click to enlarge):(Source: VentureDeal Database)The data indicate that Workday has focused its investments most often in the industries of Software and Enterprise IT.Most of its recent investments have been in the mid to later stages of company development.By geographic location, Workday has focused its investment activity on California and Washington state-based firms.Notably, Workday has been increasing its investment pace, with six disclosed investments so far in 2018 vs. only two in 2017 and one each from 2013 - 2016.That isn’t surprising as the firm announced the launch of a $250 million dedicated fund in February 2018 to invest in technologies ‘such as artificial intelligence [AI] and machine learning, blockchain, and augmented and virtual reality - that can be applied to the enterprise.’The fund announcement came on the heels of WDAY announcing the opening up of its cloud platform to outside developers.WDAY no doubt wishes to invest in firms that will develop applications for its platform, so in that sense, it may have a similar approach as that of Salesforce Ventures, which has made hundreds of investments in startups in recent years.Given Workday’s investment approach so far, however, it appears the firm is focused more on mid to later stage firms rather than Salesforce’s initial focus on seeding dozens of smaller, early-stage firms. Salesforce has since transitioned to a mid to later stage focus for its strategic investment efforts.In any event, the deal with pymetrics appears to be well within Workday’s stated focus for its $250 million investment fund, and I expect to see further investments announced as the firm continues to support technology software companies to build on its platform."
4204365,103480,2018-09-05T19:51:25-04:00,"Workday's shares slipped after the company released Q2 results, despite beating analyst expectations on both the top and bottom lines.Investors might have been disappointed at the company's continued revenue deceleration (120bps from last quarter), or its slow pace in improving operating margins.Still, Workday remains the dominant HCM company tackling a huge market opportunity, and recent acquisitions like Adaptive Insights immensely expand its TAM.Over the trailing twelve months, Workday also expanded FCF by 36% y/y. Moving forward, earnings and FCF will become a key part of the Workday story.","For each of the past four quarters, Workday's (WDAY) shares have sunk on earnings news. Investors continue to grow concerned with the pace of Workday's top-line growth - this year, Workday's growth rate slipped below 30% for the first time, and investors are worried that Workday is hitting the ceiling of its addressable market opportunity.The stock's general trend, however, is up. Directly before announcing Q2 earnings, Workday stock had touched all-time highs - despite spending the majority of the summer in a downturn. I believe the idea that Workday is in a secular slowdown is misguided. The post-Q2 pullback, in my opinion, is yet another opportunity to buy shares in a storied SaaS company that's attempting to break out into a new rally:Workday's dominance and positioning in the HCM space can't be understated. Recall that Workday came on the scene about a decade ago after Oracle's (ORCL) hostile takeover of PeopleSoft. Workday set out to build a similar HCM solution in the cloud and succeeded - becoming a ~$3 billion annual run rate business in the process, the largest cloud vendor in the space and the one with the most accolades. Along the way, Workday also added a fast-growing suite of applications in the finance and ERP space.Over the last quarter as well, Workday pulled a Cisco (CSCO) and purchased a startup company just days before its IPO: Adaptive Insights. This unicorn develops a business planning software solution that complements Workday's ERP efforts well and extends its TAM even further. The key points here: Yes, it's true that while Workday's core HCM business might not be growing as quickly as in the past, the company has shown an inclination to continue expanding its addressable market and growth trajectory through smart acquisitions. Management noted that in the long run, HCM only represents 25% of Workday's total addressable market - despite being the lion's share of revenues today. This suggests that Workday's growth trajectory is far from saturated.Workday has $3 billion of cash on its balance sheet as well as a stock near all-time highs with which to raise additional equity capital for its war chest to continue growing via acquisitions (a time-honored strategy employed by all the largest SaaS companies, from Oracle to Salesforce.com (CRM)).Workday, in my view, is one of the rarefied SaaS companies that has risen to the top of its space and will likely remain king of the hill for a long time - I'd place Workday in the same bucket as Salesforce.com here. Having grown to this scale, Workday can now focus on improving its margin profile and boosting free cash flow - in the trailing twelve months, FCF is up 36% y/y.Workday's shares certainly aren't cheap - trading at just under 12x forward revenues. As shown in the chart above, Workday trades at a decent premium to other SaaS companies at its growth rate. However, Workday's imminent transition into profitability - perhaps even on a GAAP basis in the near term - is a major driver behind its premium valuation, and the stock still has room to run higher. Stay long on this name.Here's a look at Workday's most recent quarterly results:Figure 1. Workday 2Q19 resultsSource: Workday investor relationsWorkday's revenues grew 27.9% y/y to $671.7 million, beating Wall Street's revenue expectations of $663.1 million (+26.2% y/y) by a respectable 170bps. Perhaps what investors latched onto more, however, was the fact that Workday's growth continued to decelerate, this time losing 120bps from last quarter's 29.1% y/y growth rate. Workday's growth has been in decline for the past several quarters, and last year, its growth rate had been in the low 30s. Workday's growth pace will likely get worse before it gets better, but in my view, Workday's growth will stabilize in the mid-low 20s (similar to Salesforce.com, though Salesforce is at a much larger scale).It's worth noting, however, that Workday's purchase of Adaptive Insights has allowed it to increase its guidance outlook. Previously, the company was guiding to $2.275-2.290 billion in subscription revenues (Workday doesn't guide to professional services or total revenues), but the addition of Adaptive Insights has initiated a ~$60 million bump to $2.341-2.348 billion (+31% y/y). This is the power of a company with a strong balance sheet - Workday can always arrest the decline of its growth rate by picking up a large acquisition here and again. Adaptive Insights cost Workday about $1.55 billion - so Workday still has the resources to do several of these deals.Robynne Sisco, Workday's CFO, also noted that international revenues grew a stunning 48% y/y, putting the international revenue mix at a record high of 23%. Workday still is vastly underpenetrated overseas, and in addition to growth in ERP, a lot of Workday's growth going forward will stem from its international client push.On the profit side, Workday continued to drive expansion - even though this quarter the company faced a one-time gross margin headwind related to costs from Workday's Annual Global Partner Conference, which had a slight impact on professional services margin.Still, operating loss margin improved to -13.2% on a GAAP basis, 230bps better than -15.5% in 2Q17. Workday continues to drive leverage on the sales and marketing side, which this quarter consumed 30.1% of revenues, vs. 32.7% in the year-ago quarter. Workday managed to achieve this operating margin expansion in spite of the Adaptive Insights acquisition, which management said provided a $3 million unexpected headwind to operating profits.Perhaps what investors also latched on to was the fact that Workday lowered its full-year operating margin guidance on the back of this acquisition:A drop to 9% operating margins from a previous 12% guidance is certainly a large movement - but given that these costs are likely to be one-time, however, I'd venture to look past the current year and into Workday's profitability potential in the long term. I'm encouraged by the fact that Workday beat Wall Street's pro forma EPS expectations this quarter ($0.31 actuals vs. $0.26 Street consensus), and the fact that Workday's free cash flows over the trailing twelve months grew 36% y/y:Figure 2. Workday free cash flowsSource: Workday investor relationsIn my view, Workday remains one of the best software stocks to hold over a long period of time. The company has shown a general tendency to disappoint after earnings, but the pain never lasts long. This is the second-largest pure-play enterprise SaaS company in the market, and it is a leading vendor in two massive markets - HCM and ERP. With respect to chatter about Workday's slowing growth potential, I'm instead focusing my attention on the fact that HCM is only expected to represent a quarter of Workday's long-term TAM as well as its superb international growth trend.Post-earnings dips have historically proven to be a good time to buy Workday at a discount. Stay long here."
4165794,21815,2018-04-25T14:24:13-04:00,"The company keeps doing almost everything right, with good growth, operational leverage and lots of free cash flow.There is no reason to think this won't continue, but the picture is muddied by a large amount of share-based compensation.The company's valuation is also quite stretched, in our view.","Workday (WDAY), the SaaS HCM (human capital management) provider had another strong quarter and we think they have significant growth opportunities still.Revenue growth is quite something, but the GAAP EBITDA and net income development haven't really kept pace, in fact, they have only recently been turning up.WDAY Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsQ4 figures were excellent again with an earnings beat of no less than 40% and a small (1.5%) revenue beat. They needed that improvement in the bottom line, although one has to realize that while the company is non-GAAP profitable, its GAAP figures are still substantially in the red.Still, this company is clearly doing something right. But what? We delve into their business model.We have developed a little framework for analyzing the business models of these SaaS business service companies, which tend to be veritable Swiss army knives with lots of opportunities to create additional revenue streams and leverage. Here it is:We won't go through all these steps, not all of them are salient, or even relevant for the particular company under revision. We'll discuss the most important ones.On the first point, it's obvious that their HCM offering has a good adoption rate already (Q4CC):And these customers seem to be happy, a 98% satisfaction rate is often quoted.On the second point, subscription revenues were $490M (a growth of 34%) in Q4, out of a total revenue of $582M, the rest are professional service revenues ($92M) so basically the company already fully operates on a recurring SaaS model.On the fourth point, there is indeed strong international expansion (Q4CC):On the fifth and sixth points, the company has a thriving professional service business and an ecosystem of partners. The company tends to take the hard cases with the biggest clients and the newest application itself and 'farm-out' the more routine implementation to partners in its ecosystem.Professional services earn lower margins and tend to grow a bit slower (for next year, 14% growth is expected).Point seven, sales and R&D are certainly expanding:WDAY SG&A Expense (TTM) data by YChartsThere is good leverage in SG&A, but not in R&D:WDAY Research and Development Expense (TTM) data by YChartsPoint eight, there is certainly a land and expand strategy, and this is one of the beautiful things about SaaS business platforms. The company has moved into stuff like Financial Management and Planning (Q4CC):The runway for this seems to be quite a bit larger as most companies are only now starting to embrace the cloud for their financial applications.And there are the newer modules Workday Prism Analytics and Workday Cloud Platform, which are both off to a great start, according to management.The company hasn't really been all that active on the M&A front (point nine) but the Prism product was built around the Platfora technology that the company acquired two years ago.Point ten is another interesting opportunity for SaaS business service companies in general and Workday in particular with their recently established open cloud platform, although it's very much early days (Q4CC):So this potentially enlists the intelligence of a much wider community to produce specific solutions for specific verticals, increasing the value and hence stickiness of the platform.For the last couple of points (leverage and cash flow), see below.The company seems to have a strong competitive position, driven by what management argues are the 'happiest customers' and showcase installations of big clients that function as beacons.The latter is especially true in the enterprise market, where costs come secondary to fail-safe implementation. For mid-market, cost is a driver but management argued (Q4CC):The integration of HR and financial on the same platform is also a bonus so there is no need to bolt different solutions together. It also useful that SAP (SAP) doesn't have a cloud solution for financials so there is only Workday and Oracle (ORCL) here.The company enjoyed a significant win which, according to management (Q4CC):Converting traditional ERP software users is interesting as there are quite a few out there, even if not too much can be read into a single case, of course.Their bread and butter HCM solution also seems particularly relevant in today's world (Q1CC):From the Q4CC:If this guidance materializes, growth is slowing down ever so slightly, but not alarmingly so.WDAY Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsEven on a GAAP basis, margins have trended upwards, which isn't surprising given the leverage we have already displayed above in SG&A.WDAY Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsThis is of course one of the best figures of all, and we feel it's a major driver of the share price. The company really generates large amounts of cash.However, given the fact that the company still produces substantial GAAP losses, the share-based compensation almost has to be larger, and indeed:WDAY Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsThis is also driving the share count higher, not dramatically, but still.The company also has $1.15B in outstanding convertible notes, which is quite a substantial amount of debt, even if the company also holds $1.13B in cash and cash equivalents.WDAY EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YChartsValuation has come down quite a bit but is still quite substantial for a company that isn't GAAP profitable. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $1.21 this year rising to $1.64 the next (their fiscal year ends in January).The company seems to have an impressive moat already, one which has set it up for significant growth, which we believe can last for years, given all the opportunities that their SaaS business model provides.There is a good deal of operational leverage already, and the company generates substantial amounts of free cash flow, but the latter is entirely the result of copious amounts of share-based compensation.We would argue that much of the immediate growth is already fully reflected in the share price, which commands a really substantial valuation, especially given the rise in the share count.Further appreciation of the share price is only likely if growth doesn't slow down materially, leverage increases and the company starts to buy back a substantial amount of shares to counter the dilution from the stock-based compensation."
4179070,103480,2018-06-03T13:57:12-04:00,"Following a trend it initiated last quarter, Workday's stock dropped after announcing Q1 earnings, despite beats to the top and bottom lines.The company's revenue growth ticked below 30% for the first time.Workday also barely raised its full-year outlook, indicating that its era of super growth may have come to an end.During a time of slowing growth, we'd expect Workday to focus on growing free cash flows, but Workday's OCF and FCF were flat y/y.The dip in Workday's shares open up a timely opportunity to buy a perennially expensive stock in the hopes of long-term gains.","There was a time when Workday (WDAY) was widely hailed as the most successful SaaS company. Salesforce.com (CRM) was of course the first cloud SaaS company and still the largest pure-play cloud vendor, but Workday, at least to Wall Street and to investors, was always far more exciting. Born out of a hostile takeover involving a legacy technology (PeopleSoft, acquired by Oracle (ORCL)), Workday always presented a rebellious, innovative front and has continued to dominate the market for cloud-based HR software, with legacy rivals like Oracle and SAP (SAP) trailing behind and more nimble startups like Kronos and Benefits lacking Workday's immense resources. In short, the bullish narrative for Workday has always dominated. Since the beginning of SaaS stocks' domination of the public markets, Workday has always commanded one of the richest valuation multiples within the space and the broader market.Now, however, it seems that Workday has started to lose some of its sparkle, and investors are beginning to fade in their interest. Like Salesforce, Workday is a perennial ""beat-and-raise"" company - that is, it manages expectations so well that it has managed to beat Wall Street's guidance in each and every quarter for years in a row, while continuing to raise its guidance each quarter as well. But while Workday's beat-and-raise parade has not ended, it seems investors' enthusiasm for the stock has dimmed. Since last quarter, Workday has been routinely sold off despite positive earnings news, and after a strong start to 2018 trading, Workday's shares have largely traded sideways in the past few months.WDAY data by YChartsI've never been a big fan of Workday due to its egregious valuation. Stocks at a double-digit revenue multiple simply don't have much upside in them, as Workday has demonstrated over the past few quarters. The stock was priced for perfection - and Workday gave investors good results, but not perfect. Shares fell 4% after posting Q1 earnings (shares had also fallen 4% after Q4 earnings), breaking Workday below $130. The downward move also puts Workday at a forward multiple of 9.4x, as shown in the chart above. Over the past several years, Workday has rarely traded at a sub-10x revenue multiple.Judging by its sideways performance over the past quarter and its lower-than-historical valuation (though still far from cheap), I think there could be opportunity in Workday. In the mid-$120s, I think the company is a hold - but if Workday does break below $120 and into the teens, I think there is a fantastic opportunity to buy a perennial market favorite.Workday, after all, hasn't lost its magic. It is in control of two category-leading suits of applications in HCM and ERP, and most of its competitors are light years away from it, from both a technology and revenue/customer base standpoint. Free cash flow growth this quarter was meager, but Workday did see sizable improvements in its operating margins that could lead to robust FCF growth in the future. In perhaps one or two years, investors might be able to start viewing Workday's valuation from a cash flow perspective rather than purely revenues.Don't jump the gun and buy Workday on the dip yet - but if shares continue to see pressure, it could be the right time to buy a a stock that typically is prohibitively expensive, in the hopes of long-term gains.Here's a look at the Q1 results that had disappointed investors for the second quarter in a row:Figure 1. Workday Q1 resultsSource: Workday investor relationsWorkday posted revenue growth of 29% y/y to $618.6 million in the quarter, edging out over analyst expectations of $608.7 million (+27% y/y). Note that this was the first time Workday's revenue growth slowed below 30%. Though it's only a psychological threshold, it's worth noting that in 2Q17, Workday had shown growth in excess of 40% y/y.Clearly, Workday is running up against a wall of sorts. Hyper-growth mode can't continue forever, especially in extremely competitive spaces like HCM and ERP. Though Workday is still king of the hill in HCM and a top contender in ERP, competition is closing in from all fronts - from large-cap application suites like Oracle and SAP, as well as from mid-cap companies like Ultimate Software (ULTI) and Paycom (PAYC) as well as smaller unicorns and startups. Workday is still nabbing the lion's share of the market, but it would be a mistake to think these competitors aren't stealing deals away from it.That being said, the fact that Workday is still growing at roughly 30% despite chasing a $3 billion revenue run rate is truly incredible. Very few companies are still growing at this rate when they reach this scale - Red Hat (RHT), for example, is posting growth in the low ~20s since it reached the ~$3 billion scale.Note also that subscription revenue growth - the most important portion of Workday's revenues, as professional services actually carry a negative margin - showed robust 31% y/y growth to $522.1 million. Robynne Sisco, Workday's CFO, pointed out also that 1Q17 had been a difficult comp from both a revenue and billings (backlog) standpoint on the earnings call:Workday also managed decent expansion on the profit front, due primarily to the ""record gross margins"" that management pointed out. Workday's operating loss in the quarter of -$71.2 million translated into a GAAP operating margin of -11.5%, 100 bps better than -12.5% in the year-ago quarter. Helping this profit expansion was increased efficiency in Workday's sales and marketing costs, its second-largest component of opex (unlike most SaaS companies, Workday actually spends more on R&D than sales), which also saw a 1% reduction as a percentage of revenues from the year-ago quarter.Also notable is the fact that Workday's pro forma EPS of $0.33, which adds back stock-comp to its GAAP results, beat Wall Street's expectations of $0.26 with huge 27% upside.Where Workday disappointed slightly was on the cash flow front. Operating cash flows were roughly flat y/y at $184.2 million. Netting out $48.9 million of capex, Workday's free cash flow in the quarter was $133.5 million, representing a 21.6% FCF margin, versus $149.4 million and a 31.1% margin in 1Q17. This, however, is likely due to a transitory working capital shift, and Workday is more than likely to continue its trend of FCF growth in the next quarter.Figure 2. Workday cash flowsSource: Workday investor relationsFor now, Workday still remains the entitled, expensive stock that it always has been. But judging from the sideways trading action over the past few months and the lack of bullish catalysts ahead of it, Workday could see further pressure, and I view any price in the $115 range (8.5x forward revenues) as a fair price for Workday.Though Workday's Q1 results weren't as exciting as they used to be, the company is still showing decent growth for its revenue scale, and its operating margins are also tracking in the right direction. With its net margins tracking so closely to breakeven, it's likely that Workday can hit GAAP profitability next year. This is one of many reasons to bet on Workday for the long term - but make sure to get in at the right price."
4200989,102764,2018-08-21T14:10:26-04:00,"Workday is a leading player in the much-promising cloud-based SaaS industry.The company is growing at an impressive speed, and customer retention rates are outstanding.Workday is losing money on a GAAP basis, but the business is generating positive cash flows and profitability trends are improving.Valuation levels are demanding, so investors need to be careful when building a position in Workday stock.Over the long term, Workday looks like an attractive proposition for investors in search of high-quality growth stocks.","Workday (WDAY) is a top player in cloud applications for financial management, human capital management, payroll, and analytics. The company is one of the most innovative players in the cloud-based enterprise software industry. In fact, Workday came in the second position in the Forbes Most Innovative Companies list for 2018.The business model offers some remarkably attractive characteristics. Companies such as Workday usually face elevated expenses when they are in a rapid growth phase, with stock-based compensation in areas such as product development and sales and marketing being a particularly heavy burden for Workday currently.However, as the business matures and gains scale over time, the cost to provide the service tends to decrease as a percentage of revenue. In other words, most of the company’s expenses are related to investments for growth, and this is currently masking potential profitability levels. From a structural perspective, the industry allows for huge margins once a company starts generating more money than it needs - or wants - to reinvest for growth.Workday is recognized as one of the best players in the SaaS sector. The Gartner Magic Quadrant report for 2018 recognized Workday as an industry leader in cloud core financial management applications. More importantly, customers are delighted with Workday. Based on data from the most recent earnings report, the company has over 2,200 customers and an industry-leading 98% customer satisfaction rate.The company has produced outstanding revenue growth over the long term. During the fiscal year ended in January of 2012, Workday produced only $134 million in annual revenue. Fast forward seven years, and Wall Street analysts are on average expecting the company to make $2.7 billion in sales during the current fiscal year.Workday's flagship applications in enterprise resource planning are centered around human capital management and financial management, and the company has been widely successful in these areas. Moving forward, Workday is widening its presence in areas such as inventory management, supply-chain management, and payroll processing, among others.This strategy makes a lot of sense from a commercial perspective. Once Workday is well entrenched into a customer's business processes in a particular area, it has a strategic advantage in terms of selling additional solutions to the same customer in other areas.The company is firing on all cylinders based on financial data for the quarter ended in April of 2018. Workday produced $619 million in revenue during the period, growing by 29% year over year and surpassing Wall Street forecasts by $9.8 million.Subscription revenue amounted to $522 million, increasing by 31% versus the same quarter in the prior year. Subscription revenue backlog was $5.2 billion for the period, an increase of 31% year over year. International revenue came in at $139 million during the quarter, growing by 43% and representing 22% of total revenue.Workday is losing money on a GAAP basis, mostly because of the impact of stock-based-compensation. Employee compensation, both in cash and stock-based forms, is a key expense item for companies in the SaaS industry, so this is a very real item that needs to be considered when evaluating overall profitability levels for Workday. That being acknowledged, we also need to analyze profitability on a cash flow basis and in adjusted terms to evaluate the main trends in profit margins.Cash generation is remarkably healthy. Trailing 12 months operating cash flow reached a record high at $470 million last quarter, up 28% year over year. Free cash flow during the 12 months period amounted to $310 million, a 24% increase year over year.Workday delivered a GAAP operating loss of $71.3 million during the quarter, or a negative 11.5% of revenue vs. a negative 12.5% of revenues in the same period last year. On the other hand, Non-GAAP operating income reached $80.8 million, or 13.1% of revenue, compared to a non-GAAP operating income of $61.0 million, or 12.7% of revenue, in the same period last year.The balance sheet is clearly solid, Workday as a net cash position, meaning cash and liquid investments net of financial debt, of nearly $1.9 billion.In a nutshell, the company is increasing revenue at full speed. The business is non-profitable on a GAAP basis yet, but it's already generating positive cash flows, and profitability levels are moving in the right direction.Importantly, Workday has an impressive track record at delivering earnings numbers above Wall Street forecasts and driving increasing expectations about future performance. The table shows the expected earnings figure and the actual reported number for Workday over the past four quarters.The chart below shows the stock price in comparison to earnings expectations for both the current year and next fiscal year. Like usually happens, the stock price and earnings expectations tend to move in the same direction over time. If this trend remains in place going forward, increasing earnings expectations bode well for investors in Workday.Workday operates in a remarkably dynamic industry, and the company faces challenging competition from big incumbents such as Oracle (ORCL) and SAP (SAP). The fact that Workday has managed to outperform the competition in the past several years speaks remarkably well about the superiority of its cloud-native applications and the quality of its management team.However, both Oracle and SAP are also venturing into smarter solutions based on cloud technologies, and the SaaS industry is fertile ground for smaller players with innovative offerings and rapid growth ambitions. In other words, Workday is not a stock to ""buy and forget,"" it's important to monitor the always changing competitive landscape in the industry.Valuation is also quite demanding. Workday trades at a price to sales ratio around 13.3; that's more than double the average price to sales ratio around 5.8 for companies in the software industry.The most succesful players in software trade at price to sales ratios similar to those of Workday. The chart below shows the price to sales ratio for Workday versus ServiceNow (NOW), Autodesk (ADSK), Shopify (SHOP), and Splunk (SPLK).The average price to sales ratio for the 4 high growth players in software - excluding Workday - stands at 14. This means that Workday is not necessarily overvalued if it can continue delivering revenue growth rates in line with those of the best players in the software industry.However, it's important to note that Workday is priced for demanding growth expectations, and a high bar is hard to beat. If there is any disappointment down the road, the stock is clearly vulnerable to the downside from current valuation levels.Workday is a top player in a remarkably promising industry. The company is generating outstanding revenue growth and customer retention rates are downright spectacular. Lack of current profitability is an important risk factor to keep in mind, but the balance sheet is notoriously healthy, the business is generating positive cash flows, and profitability levels are improving.At current valuation levels, the stock is priced for demanding expectations, so investors should be cautious when building a position in Workday. As opposed to buying a full position at current prices, maybe it makes more sense to buy a partial - smaller - position right now and increase the size of such position if the stock offers a more attractive entry price in the middle term.One thing looks quite clear. Workday is a high quality growth business. As long as the fundamentals remain solid, any adjustment in the stock price could be a buying opportunity for long-term investors in the stock."
4182093,103480,2018-06-16T10:42:01-04:00,"Workday, a perennial investor favorite, has been under pressure over the past several weeks after a disappointing Q1 earnings announcement.The company's growth has fallen below 30% for the first time, highlighting the need to push beyond HCM for growth.Workday snapped up Adaptive Insights, a business planning software vendor, for $1.55 billion just days before its impending IPO.Though it paid about 11x forward revenues for the company, Adaptive Insight's software has great synergies with Workday's ERP suite and can provide 3-4 points of inorganic revenue growth to this year's estimates alone.","Getting the cold shoulder from investors and Wall Street is a new feeling for Workday (WDAY), a company that has long been an investor favorite and a perennial chart-topper among tech stock valuations. Despite a strong Q1 earnings beat that topped Wall Street's expectations on both the top and bottom lines, Workday shares have slipped sideways and have still yet to recover from its post-earnings doldrums. The message from investors was clear: Workday is no longer as exciting as it used to be, and despite a gain in margins and free cash flow, investors need to be able to see upside in Workday's long-term growth potential.Earlier this week, Workday provided an answer to at least part of investors' qualms by announcing its $1.55 billion acquisition of Adaptive Insights (ADIN), on the heels of the target's planned IPO. Though Workday is not entirely new to the M&A sphere, it's generally much less acquisitive than its large-cap SaaS peers - which is part of the reason investors have come to love Workday. Most of its growth is organic and home-grown, whereas peers like Salesforce.com (CRM) somewhat fabricate its progress toward its lofty revenue targets by making eye-popping acquisitions, such as its recent $6.5 billion purchase of MuleSoft (MULE) at approximately 16x forward revenues - a 50% higher valuation than what Workday paid for Adaptive Insights.Workday's last-minute grab for Adaptive Insights hearkens back to last year, when Cisco (CSCO) swooped in to buy app monitoring software firm AppDynamics for $3.7 billion the day before its IPO - at 2x the price the IPO was intended at. Workday's $1.55 billion splurge on Adaptive Insights also represents a >2x premium to the company's intended IPO valuation of $5-$670 million (though had Adaptive Insights proceeded with its IPO, it would likely have followed in the footsteps of other successful software IPOs this year and boosted its pricing range above this initial target).The underlying theme is clear: high-quality software stocks are a hot commodity, and large companies like Workday are scoping out all potential targets as the SaaS model becomes more widespread in the software sector and companies need additional sources of growth. Despite the steep price Workday paid for Adaptive Insights, however, I believe it to be an extremely prescient acquisition that will be highly accretive to Workday's growth.Workday's investors are less impressed, with the stock still down from its April highs (even as the NASDAQ roars to new records). It's also worth noting that Workday's current forward revenue multiple of 9.6x, while still expensive for any SaaS stock, is far below its historical average in the double digits. Furthermore, in a time when new IPOs have routinely blasted to revenue multiples in the 14-16x range (DocuSign (DOCU), Dropbox (DBX), Zuora (ZUO), and Zscaler (ZS) all trade at revenue multiples that are now absurdly higher than Workday), it's no longer really accurate to call Workday one of the most expensive stocks in software.WDAY data by YChartsIn my view, Workday is a stock that is rarely on sale - so the continued pressure in shares is a fantastic buying opportunity. Though investors were disappointed with its near-term growth, Workday's purchase of Adaptive Insights - and the implied renewal of focus on expanding the ERP business - will be a huge win for the company.Recall from Adaptive Insights' S-1 filing that it has quite a traditional financial profile for a SaaS IPO candidate: slightly over $100 million in revenues at a 30% growth rate.Figure 1. Adaptive Insights financialsSource: Adaptive Insights investor relationsThe company posted 30% y/y revenue growth in FY18 to $106.5 million, with a slight pickup in growth rate in the first quarter of FY19 to 32% y/y. If we assume Adaptive Insights can hold its 30% growth rate for the coming year (and this can be considered a baseline scenario after Workday's purchase - having access to Workday's customer list and sales resources will likely take Adaptive Insight's growth rate much higher in 2018), we arrive at a conservative FY19 revenue estimate of $138.5 million. (Thus, a purchase price of $1.55 billion implies an 11x revenue multiple).Recall also that Workday has guided to $2.275-$2.290 billion in subscription revenues for FY19. Assuming the 83% and 17% mix of subscription and services revenues that Workday posted in FY18, we arrive at an estimated midpoint for total revenues of $2.736 billion for FY19, or +28% y/y. This means that, by purchasing Adaptive Insights and acquiring its $138.5 million of forward estimated revenues, Workday has bumped up its FY19 growth rate up by six points to +34% y/y (combined, the two companies will have estimated revenues of $2.874 billion, versus $2.143 billion in FY18).Essentially, Adaptive Insights allows Workday to solve its sub-par growth problem. Note that these are still conservative estimates that don't account for the innate synergies between the two platforms. Though Workday has long had dual offerings in both HCM and ERP, HCM has always been its core offering while ERP was more or less a side business. As the HCM business saturates (Workday is already the undisputed, #1 leader in cloud HR solutions), it becomes incumbent on ERP to set the stage for further growth.Adaptive Insights' niche software for business planning and KPI measurement, intended primarily for use by FP&A teams, fits in nicely with Workday ERP's suite of products for corporate accounting and tax departments. Adaptive Insights' newer use cases also support planning and resource management for operations and procurement teams, which also jives well with Workday's additional modules for purchasing and inventory management. Here's the statement from Workday's acquisition announcement detailing how the company intends to fold Adaptive Insights into the business:There is little overlap between the two applications - Adaptive Insights' planning functions can be thought of as an additional module that complements Workday ERP. In my view, there are few acquisitions Workday could have made to bolster its ERP growth that are more accretive than this one.Workday has long had a history of being very conservative with its acquisitions. Unlike Salesforce and Oracle (ORCL), the company tends to only make small tuck-in acquisitions primarily for IP, and rarely anything that is immediately accretive to the top line. Workday's 11x purchase multiple for Adaptive Insights might appear rich, but with $3.3 billion of cash on its balance sheet, Workday made an extremely smart purchase to boost its expected FY19 growth rate by 6 points.Stay on the lookout for well-timed buying opportunities in this top-tier SaaS stock, especially if shares continue to slide."
4151585,103480,2018-02-28T06:28:49-05:00,"Workday stock fell ~4% after hours on Q4 earnings.The company posted a marginal beat to both the top and bottom line, but investors were still looking for more.Trading at about 9.5x forward revenues, Workday is one of the most expensive stocks in software and its rich valuation already prices in strong execution.Workday faces plenty of competition as its penetration into its key market verticals (HCM and ERP software) saturates even more.After a strong rally in 2017, the stock is looks set to underperform in 2018.","It seems that Workday (NASDAQ: WDAY), the giant cloud HCM (human capital management) software vendor, goes through the same patterned cadence every time it releases an earnings quarter. The company almost always manages to beat Wall Street expectations by a decent margin, but more often than not, shares fall in response to optically good earnings. The stock falls after the quarter, but not long after it picks its rally right back up again until the next quarter. Certainly a well-timed trader can make outlandish gains on the dramatic boom-and-bust cycles.Be careful, however, not to confuse hype and trading cycles with the underlying fundamentals. Yes, it's true that Workday is a fantastic, category-leading company that took HR software from the dark ages to the cloud computing era. And for a ~$2 billion run rate company, its >30% growth is stellar. But even the highest quality companies aren't immune to the limits of valuation. Along with Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK), Workday is continually vying for the title of most expensive stock in software, with its trading multiple frequently exceeding 10x forward revenues. Even now, after a lifted guidance and a slight post-quarter pullback in Workday shares, the company still trades at 9.5x forward revenues - when other high-growth software stocks are typically trading between 6-7x.If Workday was capable of perfect execution every single quarter and kept showing 30% growth quarter after quarter (not the case according to its FY19 guidance), then a ~10x multiple might be worth paying. But every quarter, investors seem to take some issue with Workday's results. Last time, in Q3, a miss in billings (which grew only 25% and lagged behind revenue growth) as well as a weak FY19 forecast sent shares plummeting 10% after earnings. This quarter, it seems that investors aren't too pleased with how small of a beat margin Workday delivered against consensus expectations, or with the fact that its subscription revenue guidance barely went up from the poor outlook it gave in Q3.Of course, history shows us that Workday always keeps bouncing back from its pullbacks, suggesting that all the dips should be bought - but I for one think there are much better and cheaper stocks in the software industry to buy. The fact that Workday has become a giant company is both a boon and a curse for it - its scale has allowed it to generate massive cash flows and earn top rankings among IT buyers and industry analysts, but eventually its growth will peter down to the 20s, at which point investors may rethink about paying 10x revenues. There's a broad field of fierce competitors in both of Workday's key enterprise software markets (HCM and ERP), and Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) in particular has its hands in both arenas, especially after its $9.2 billion acquisition of Netsuite's ERP platform.The market seems to be telling us that Workday needs to achieve to a much higher standard to keep its rich valuation. In this case, good just isn't good enough.Let's take a deeper dive into Workday's results in the quarter:Figure 1. Workday Q4 resultsSource: Workday investor relationsThe company generated $582.5 million of revenues in the quarter, up 33% y/y and surpassing analyst expectations of $573.7 million (+30% y/y) by a small margin. A three-point beat is a good beat, but it still does leave a lot to be desired for a company trading at 10x revenues. Everything must be taken in context of Workday's high valuation - a beat of this magnitude should be expected, if not exceeded. For reference, other SaaS companies that have reported in the quarter - like communications PaaS company Twilio (NASDAQ: TWLO), university course management software company Instructure (NASDAQ: INST), and identity governance software company SailPoint (NASDAQ: SAIL), all beat analyst expectations by 10 points or more. These companies also all share the distinction of trading between 5-6.5x forward revenues - put another way, 50% cheaper than Workday for much better performance against expectations. In this way, buying Workday shares is a bit like buying a BMW electric vehicle over a Prius - it's more expensive and has a bit more of a flashy brand, but you don't get too much added performance.Certainly Workday's extension into ERP software helps sustain its growth, rather than if it were still a pure HCM company. Yet the rise of the Netsuite-Oracle combination as well as upstarts like Sage and BlackLine (NASDAQ: BL) will also slowly chip away at Workday's dominance in the field. Nor can it expand downmarket and chase growth by going after SMBs, because in the world of mom-and-pops with simpler accounting needs, Quickbooks by Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU) reigns supreme.Another disappointing fact on Workday's earnings - we would have hoped that by now, at a $2 billion revenue scale, the company would have hit GAAP profitability. Red Hat (NASDAQ: RHT), probably the closest software company to it in size, already generates a healthy net profit margin as well as strong cash flows. Workday certainly delivers on the cash flow side (though its FCF growth has slowed down), but still hasn't delivered the operating efficiencies we would have expected. Workday's ardent defenders might argue that Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), at four times its size and the largest SaaS company, also hasn't yet hit GAAP profitability - but again, all things must be taken in context of Workday's valuation. Salesforce trades at just ~7x forward revenues, a fairly substantial discount to Workday - so it's fair to ask for more out of Workday.Workday generated a GAAP operating loss of -$81.3 million, roughly flat from a loss of -$88.9 million in the year-ago quarter. This does represent an improvement in GAAP operating margin from -20% to -14% - but perhaps not quite good enough. The company's pro forma EPS of $0.28 did beat analyst consensus of $0.20 by a pretty good margin, but still not enough to sway investors into bidding shares up.On the cash flow side, it was also more of the same - some growth, but nothing to get too excited about. Operating cash flows grew just 18% y/y to $126.5 million in the quarter. Netting out $36.1 million of capex, Workday generated just $90.5 million of free cash flow, growing just 17% y/y.Figure 2. Workday FCFSource: Workday investor relationsTwo more notes on the cash flow side: first, these cash flow results against $482.5 million of revenues indicates that FCF margins actually compressed to 15%, down from 18% in 4Q17 - not really that impressive for a company of its size. As a reference point, Adobe (the other expensive large-cap software name) grew free cash flows by 23% y/y in its most recent quarter despite being at a larger scale, and achieved a whopping FCF margin of 40%. That company, in my opinion, is far more deserving of its ~10x forward revenue multiple. The final note on cash flows: while the fact that Workday generates substantial cash flows already makes it a rarity in Silicon Valley, Workday's FCF isn't yet enough to support its current ~$27 billion market cap and ~$25.5 billion enterprise value. Based on FY18 FCF of $324.2 million, Workday's backward-looking FCF multiple is nearly 80x. Workday needs time for its results and top-line growth to catch up to its monstrous valuation. As such, the company is likely to underperform in 2018 - especially as volatility returns to the markets and investors' risk-off attitude turns them away from richly valued momentum stocks. While the company still remains a category leader and a favorite of customers and the broad IT community, a liking of the business and product does not necessarily translate to an endorsement of the stock. Stay wary of this name as it gets over the hangover of a ~50% rally in the last twelve months that has stretched its valuation to tenuous levels."

Although the company has only been public for a few years, its price action has formed a strong base formation and is now breaking out higher. Demand for its cloud service is strong, leading to revenue growth. It continues to lose money, but is reducing the size of its losses in recent quarters. I am buying stock in the name and looking to hold for 1-5 years.WDAY's share price looks to be breaking out higher on both its short- and long-term charts. Below are its hourly and monthly chart. Although WDAY has not been a public company for very long, its share price looks to be building a solid long-term base. As fundamental growth has accelerated, investors have begun to bid its share price up to new highs. Its recent break above $115 was significant as this level had acted as strong long-term resistance. Moreover, on its short-term chart, the price action is similarly bullish. The stock has trended higher over the last year, with few pullbacks, and no selling pressure strong enough to derail the trend lines. As its fundamental story improves, and demand for its services continue to be strong, its stock should continue to trend higher. I am however watching the $119 level as a stop-loss. This area has acted as support recently, and should its share price dip below these levels, it would violate my buy thesis and force me to sell. Source: Trading ViewWDAY is seeing strong top-line growth while it attempts to turn to profitability in coming years. In the most recent quarter, the company saw total revenues come in at $555.4 million, an increase of 34.4% from the third quarter of fiscal 2017. This was led by a rise in subscription revenues to $463.6 million, an increase of 37.2% from the same period last year. Subscription revenue represents about 83% of total sales, signaling its strong growth is having a significant impact on WDAY's top-line.The company's leadership in enterprise cloud applications for finance and human resources have led to WDAY's impressive growth in recent years. For example, the company is the leading provider of finance and HR in the cloud, according to management. Not only did WDAY see continued traction in finance, but now more than 30% of Fortune 500 company's have selected its platform for core HR.Additionally, the company is continuing to invest in future products and platforms for its customers. WDAY is increasing strength among medium enterprises and is seeing strong adoption of new products like Workday Planning. This allows the company to continue growing market share globally, while maintaining high customer satisfaction across the industry, according to management.WDAY's subscription based model underpins its revenue success. Its subscription model stabilizes its cash flow, and allows for a recurring revenue stream when the company on-boards new clients. For example, the recurring cash flow of its revenue model allows its to allocate more capital towards investment projects, while planning spending in its core-operations as well.Management had this to say about its areas of investment:One of the key issues with WDAY is its large operating losses. In its most recent quarter, its operating loss was $80.1 million, or negative 14.4% of revenues, compared to an operating loss of $105.9 million, or negative 25.6% of revenues, in the same period last year. While losses are still steep, it is getting better on a relative basis. Below is a chart of both WDAY's revenue and earnings per share. While the company's revenue has nearly quadrupled over the last five years, its losses have increased. Only in the last quarter did losses become more shallow. The key is that WDAY continues to see strong demand for its products, allowing for the smooth exponential growth fueling investor optimism and its share price higher. When bottom-line growth picks up in coming years potentially, this could further drive returns for shareholders. WDAY is breaking out higher on strong fundamental support. Although the company has only been public for a few years, its price action has formed a strong base formation and is now breaking out higher. Demand for its cloud service is strong, leading to revenue growth. It continues to lose money, but is reducing the size of its losses in recent quarters.

4129306,103480,2017-12-04T01:03:32-05:00,"Workday shares have lost more than 10% this week, coinciding with a Q3 release that investors greeted with plenty of skepticism.While the stock beat top line estimates with 34% y/y revenue growth, its billings growth came in much lower at 25% y/y.As billings is the more forward-looking indicator of Workday's sales traction, the underwhelming billings result is the much more important metric.Combined with a weaker-than-expected guidance for 2019, investors are beginning to pencil in lower growth rates for Workday than previously expected.For a stock that is so perennially expensive (usually trading above 10x revenues), Workday's less-than-perfect execution merits the company's sell-off.","Betting against Workday (NYSE: WDAY), the leading cloud-based provider of HR and financial software, has long been a losing game. Shorting Workday is probably one of the most contrarian calls one could make in the software sector, because everyone loves Workday's story. What's not to love about an underdog story - the company that was born out of Oracle's (NASDAQ: ORCL) hostile takeover of PeopleSoft, and is now out on a mission to liberate enterprise IT from on-prem software with agile, user-friendly, cloud-based HR solutions?Despite Workday's meteoric climb to a $20-plus billion market cap and industry-leading awards in the HCM software (human capital management) space, as recognized by Gartner, the company is no longer that exciting - at least not to growth investors. Make no mistake, Workday is still the best at what it does from a product standpoint, but as I wrote in a prior article, HCM and ERP are no longer exactly growth markets, and with competition fierce from other large-cap providers, Workday is quickly descending into the mundane - a company that has good growth and has scaled to profitability, yes; but no longer an investor's silver ace.Why pay 10x revenues for a stock that isn't outstanding? In the last week of November, the software sector's most expensive stocks, Workday and Autodesk (NASDAQ: ADSK), both got pummeled for less-than-stellar earnings and dimmer outlooks than expected. In my opinion, Workday's ~15% slide in the week was just the tip of the iceberg - with sentiment flipping from nothing-but-positive to skeptical on the company, the company's high valuation can soon crumble.WDAY Price data by YChartsThe average high-growth software stock growing at ~30%, with a differentiated product offering and well-defined technology leadership in its space, trades at roughly 7x forward revenues, and with Workday's shimmer of hypergrowth mostly gone, that's what I believe the company to be worth. 7x EV/FTM revenues imply a price target of $85, unchanged from my prior view. Workday isn't a poor software investment, nor is it a terrific one - and investors are finally taking it for what it is: a decent grower in a mature market.Workday posted revenue of $555.4 million in the quarter (+34% y/y). Analysts were only expecting revenue of $540.6 million (+31% y/y). Subscription revenues in the quarter were $463.6 million, up 37% y/y.Figure 1. Workday Q3 revenueSource: Workday Q3 earnings releaseWe note that Workday's subscription revenue growth of 37% decelerated markedly from Q2's subscription growth rate of 42%. Still, however, at the surface, Workday's revenue results look like a pretty solid beat. Especially when considering that the company's bottom line metrics played out well: operating losses slimmed to just -$80.1 million (-14% operating margin), versus -$105.9 million (-26% margin) in the prior year's Q3. Workday was able not only to achieve greater sales leverage but slim down its corporate overhead expenses as well, powering a vast improvement in operating margins.Though Workday posted a GAAP net loss, its adjusted earnings (which add back stock-comp and other noncash expenses) in the quarter were $0.24 per share, smashing analyst pro forma EPS estimates of $0.15. Workday also achieved $144 million of operating cash flow (a doubling from last year's Q3) and $108 million of free cash flow.Those are the headline numbers. Unfortunately, a closer look at the results reveals the ogres hiding in the closet.The first problematic sign - as analysts and investors were quick to point out - was billings. Billings, as most know, is the sum of revenues plus change in deferred revenues - a measure of the business that Workday signed in that quarter, but will be ratably recognized as revenue over time. Thus, it's billings, not revenue, that present the clearest forward-looking picture of Workday's success.The company stopped giving billings guidance a while ago, justifying the move by declaring billings as too erratic a metric to judge the business by. Or perhaps it's because it didn't want to reveal just how quickly its high-growth business was decelerating. Workday's billings growth in the quarter was just 25% y/y - a far cry behind its revenue growth, and a leading indicator of future growth declines. Billings have been on a continual decline this year, with Q2's billings growth rate of 31% y/y also underwhelming analysts' expectations.The other related issue is Workday's fiscal 2019 (calendar 2018) guidance, which it offered a sneak peek at for the first time in Q3. As usual, Workday's guidance is rather sparse - it offered only its view on subscription revenues of ~$2.25 billion.Given that Workday has just updated its FY18 subscription revenue guidance to $1.780-1.782 billion, the company's FY19 guidance points to just 26% y/y growth in subscription revenues. This is terrible news for investors who are already reeling from Workday's continuous declines in subscription revenue growth this year: 43% growth in Q1, 42% in Q2, and 37% in Q3. Additionally, Workday's FY18 guidance implies a guide of $483.2 million in subscription revenues for Q4 - and that's 32% y/y growth from 4Q17's subscription revenues of $365.2 million.The company's sliding subscription rate, weak FY19 guidance compounding that deceleration, and weak billings in Q3 are telling a coherent story: the Workday growth machine is slowing down much more rapidly than investors thought.Despite the bearish tone of this article, I still think Workday is a fantastic company. It's well-loved by customers, has the best HR software platform in the business (as validated by Gartner), and has additional growth opportunities through its ERP and platform offerings. The only issue with Workday is its valuation - a stance many investors would agree with.In the low $90s or mid-$80s, however, the story is different. At a price target of $85, I'd be long on Workday. At those levels, it would be appropriately valued for what it is: a market-leading application software company in a maturing market, with strong cash flow and moderate prospects for growth."
4111507,21815,2017-10-03T23:20:34-04:00,"Workday has multiple avenues for company growth.The end stage would be that it evolves into a platform offering a more or less complete suite of business software solutions, developed in-house and by third parties.For now, much of this growth is already priced in the shares, though.","Workday (WDAY) is a company that has terrific growth opportunities in front of it, although the shares do reflect these opportunities quite a bit already.It's very much in evidence, look at the quarterly growth rate (compared to the quarter in the prior year):Yeah, the phase of hypergrowth has passed, but from mid-2016 there is some sort of re-acceleration materializing, which is quite amazing. Now, that growth will decelerate a bit to the low to mid-30s in the second half as the quarterly comps are pretty difficult; but still, full-year subscription revenue growth is guided up at 36%.However, under the hood there might be some signs of a slowdown, as SA contributor Bert Hochfeld has noted:He argues that investors hold shares in Workday for one reason only - continued expectation of hyper growth. This is convincing, as the company is still far from any profitability and if underlying growth metrics are slowing, this could start to pose a problem in the near future.Having argued that, the company still has lots of growth opportunities:The company started as a human resource management application provider or as they prefer to call it HCM, human capital management. Offering enterprise software on a cloud platform is a very attractive proposition, as it liberates clients from a host of implementation, support and maintenance issues.We tend to forget now, but one or two decades ago the implementation of big enterprise software more often than not used to be a nightmarish experience for many companies.The implementation still takes a good deal of time, but at least much of the heavy lifting is taken out of the clients' hands, as well as the capacity and maintenance issues. It now takes the company 12-13 months for the big Fortune 500 companies to go into production.Now, management believes that they are still in the first innings of cloud HCM adoption, but we have to attend the reader to the fact that they have already amassed a good deal of Fortune 500 customers; more than 30% of these have selected Workday for their core HR functionality already.That figure is rather large already and makes us question whether they are only in the first innings here, but management argues that 50% of these companies haven't made a decision yet. Also, there are foreign and smaller companies to go after; management on the Q2CC:Management also argues that ""success begets success;"" that is, these big companies talk to one another and/or see which implementations are successful and the word spreads.They had several notable wins, especially with Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), which could be argued might have been more inclined to SAP (SAP), Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) (NYSE:RDS.B) in Europe and Johnson Electric Holdings in Japan.Once customers are on the platform, switching costs are high (which is one reason why evaluation of platforms tends to be extensive), but it seems that Workday keeps their customers happy.At least, management argued on the Q2CC that ""Our customer satisfaction rate remains among the highest in the enterprise cloud."" Gartner's famous Magic Quadrant seems to buttress their status as the leader (as did Forrester's Wave Report):Happy customers buy more, and this is indeed what has been happening, per Q2CC:But Hochfeld cited a study according to which the HCM market is only growing at roughly 9% CAGR in the coming 5 years.Having a platform offers the company the opportunity to add applications. Workday is a little more ambitious and started with a whole new direction, namely financial applications.Finance is in the very early stages of moving to the cloud; so this is another significant growth opportunity for the company. It's growing significantly faster than their HR business but it's still just some 10% of new bookings, plenty of room to grow here as they really are in the first innings.There is, of course, nothing to stop the company to add other modules for other corporate functions, and they are doing just that. A little overview:Before you know it they develop into a swiss army knife of solutions, or better (with integrated dataflows) into an online ERP (enterprise resource planning) SaaS company. Indeed, to some extent, this is already happening, as planning acts as a bridge between financials and HCM. Indeed, when asked about ERP during the Q2CC, this was management's response:It doesn't even have to stop there. They can further specialize these modules in terms of industry specificity, embodying industry's best practices. And with respect to ""somebody wanting to build a supply chain or manufacturing on top"":The company's evolution towards a platform is the latest stage in their development; here is management during the Q2CC:What does that mean, platform (or PaaS, platform-as-a-service)? Well, it means that customers, partners, independent software vendors and developers are empowered to build extensions and applications for the software.It wasn't discussed in detail during the CC but we assume there is some sort of revenue-sharing model behind this. The first phase will allow customers to customize and offer their own solutions, a later second phase will open the platform up for independent software vendors.GAAP margins generally are moving in the right direction, but operating and profit margins are still solidly negative.The company is also generating considerable amounts of cash; but this is in no small amount due to stock-based compensation, and the growth is slowing down:Free cash flow this year will reach about $260M, not really an enormous amount for a $20B company.While the company has significant growth opportunities ahead of it, it's not sure how they will play out in terms of speed. There are some signs that growth is actually slowing down, and given the elevated and even increasing levels of costs, most notably stock-based compensation, we think much of the growth is already priced in with the shares around an EV/S of nine or so, at least not for us."

He also offered a few other acquisition targets for Microsoft (MSFT), among which are Twilio (TWLO) and ServiceNow (NOW).But what about Workday (WDAY)? The company offers a HCM (human capital management) SaaS platform that has been growing nothing short of explosively:So one thing Microsoft would buy is growth, although with the not unimportant proviso that $2B is hardly moving the needle for a company of Microsoft's size, approaching $100B in sales.Another argument would be that it offers benefits in excess of the takeover premium, and here things get fairly interesting. We see two entry points for discussion here:To start with the latter, at first sight, recruitment looks like a very useful extension of human capital management, but one has to be a little careful here.The Workday HCM platform really is an extension of the company which uses it, it's a company tool. LinkedIn is a platform that plays on both sides of the job market, companies might not be willing to promote these functions to their employees.Equally, many employees who are likely to already be on LinkedIn might not want to alarm their bosses that they are looking for jobs elsewhere, and the danger is that their search activities become accessible should LinkedIn become a part of the Workday platform.Perhaps there are technological ways around that which aren't immediately obvious to us, but we see a potential for problems here.Could Workday help Microsoft's cloud business Azure? Well, there is something in this as Azure is still far behind Amazon's (AMZN) cloud business; from Bloomberg (our emphasis):While Azure is still far behind in terms of sales, it is catching up in terms of features:But Amazon's AWS is very much a moving target as it keeps innovating and adding features at a rapid pace; from Techcrunch:Perhaps the following (in bold) captures the essence of Microsoft's cloud strategy better than anything; from Bloomberg:Here is where Workday's SaaS HCM platform can help. Basically, it helps companies to ""understand themselves"" better by allowing them to manage their resources better. But there is another reason why a Workday acquisition could help Microsoft's Azure:The main way Microsoft has a leg up on Amazon is that it already has relations with most businesses in the US, and many around the world. And relationships matter. Indeed, here is Techcrunch again:Buying Workday would add another series of relationships, expanding its contact surface and deepening many existing relationships.When we discussed Workday in an article here on Seeking Alpha, we also noted that the company is moving beyond HCM into other areas, like finance, analytics and planning.Before you know it, it becomes a veritable Swiss army knife of business solutions in the cloud, and that would be Microsoft's cloud. We also noted the following from Workday's Q2CC:PaaS or platform as a service simply allows customers, partners, independent software vendors and developers to build extensions and applications for the software housed in the cloud. Which is what Microsoft already does with Azure. That is, an acquisition of Workday allows Microsoft to extend its cloud and give it additional functionality.While Workday would just add $2B of revenue, Microsoft would have to pay at least 12x that and then some to actually acquire it as its market cap is $23.45B. At least that multiple has trended down from the stratosphere a few years ago:The company is so expensive that a few analyst houses are distinctly neutral on the shares with price targets below the current market price, and UBS even slapped a sell rating and a $95 target on the shares earlier this month.Microsoft had $6.88B in cash and another $131.58B in short-term investments on its balance sheet at the end of Q1 FY2018; it would not have a problem acquiring Workday.Normally, we're very hesitant on M&A, simply because the success rate of these is below 50%. However, given the top priority Microsoft has given to develop its cloud platform Azure, we think there are good reasons for acquiring Workday, as this offers new business relationships, deepens existing ones and adds functionality that can be extended and developed further. Workday doesn't come cheap though, quite the contrary."
4105125,20521,2017-09-07T18:32:32-04:00,,"According to a market research report by MarketsandMarkets published earlier this year, the global Human Capital Management (NASDAQ:HCM) market size is expected to grow 9.2% annually over the next five-year period. The industry is expected to grow from $14.50 billion in 2017 to $22.51 billion by 2022.Recently, SaaS-based HCM services provider Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) announced its second quarter results that surpassed all market expectations. Revenues grew 40.6% over the year to $523 million, significantly ahead of the Street's forecast of $507 million. EPS of $0.24 was also ahead of the market's forecast of $0.15.By segment, subscription revenues grew 42% to $434.5 million and professional services revenues grew 34% to $90.8 million.During the quarter, Gartner announced that Workday was in the Leaders quadrant of the first-ever Magic Quadrant for Cloud Core Financial Management Suites for Midsize, Large, and Global Enterprises.For the full year, Workday raised its outlook for subscription revenue to $1.75-$1.757 billion, compared with the earlier forecast of $1.705-$1.72 billion. The market was looking for subscription revenues of $1.717 billion for the year. For the current quarter, Workday forecast subscription revenues of $450-$452 million, vs. the consensus of $435 million. Overall, for the year, Workday forecast revenues of $2.093-$2.1 billion, compared with the market forecast of $2.05 billion.Last quarter, Workday made two important product enhancements. First, it announced a fixed fee, pre-configured application package for US-based medium enterprises. The move is in line with Workday's focus on the medium-sized businesses. The application package will be delivered by Workday services and its deployment partners. The packages are based on the success of Workday's existing deployments in the medium enterprise market. Workday believes that these will be a preferred offering as most companies prefer a single business partner for finance, payroll, and human resources. The packages will be made available to international markets soon.Secondly, it has announced its intention to enter the Platform-as-a-Service market by opening the Workday Cloud Platform to its customers' partners, independent software vendors, and developers. The service will allow customers to be get access to a broader ecosystem of partners, ISVs, and developers with a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). Ultimately, the move will help build custom extensions and applications for customers' business needs. This move opens up yet another competitive front against Salesforce.Last month, Workday announced the acquisition of the team behind a Redwood City, California,-based startup called Pattern. Founded in 2015, Pattern has worked on managing customer relationships for salespeople. It has been backed by Felicis Ventures, SoftTech VC, First Round Capital, and various angel investors. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. This move, also, sets them up against Salesforce.The market also is awaiting the release of Workday Prism Analytics, expected to be launched this fall. Prism is an analytic solution that has been developed on Amazon as part of Workday's cloud services by leveraging the Platfora acquisition. Prism will allow organizations to pull data from a variety of sources into Workday for analysis. They will be able to develop a virtual data warehouse and users across different functions will gain the ability to access data stored in Workday and other SaaS-based products including ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM).Its stock is trading at $108.84 with a market capitalization of $22.4 billion. It has recovered from a 52-week low of $65.79 it had fallen to in December last year, and had touched a 52-week high of $111.45 earlier last month. The company plans to shift from the NYSE to Nasdaq later this month."
4104161,103480,2017-09-05T12:17:36-04:00,"Trading above 10x forward revenues, Workday is one of the most expensive stocks to own in software.While quarterly earnings releases have been well-managed to deliver consistent beats, increased competition in Workday's core HCM and ERP spaces will inhibit future growth.Workday's stock is priced for flawless execution, something that can't happen when deep-pocketed competitors (Microsoft, Oracle, and others) are waiting to grab market share.With shares barely responding to a beat-and-raise Q2, chances are good that investors are soon to dump Workday.","Okay, so maybe competition won't tear Workday (NYSE: WDAY) apart entirely - but the stock is sure to see a pullback in the near term.For the past few years, Workday has been an absolute investor favorite. It's one of the most expensive stocks in cloud software, trading at 10x EV/FTM revenues, nearly twice the valuation of Salesforce (NYSE: CRM). Investors buy Workday shares almost like they buy Bitcoin - without thinking, without understanding, because they think it can only go one direction: up.Workday posted Q2 earnings last week, and as usual, it beat expectations in a big way. But by now, beating expectations is already expected. The stock briefly popped 2% after hours immediately after the earnings report, but ended the week basically flat. Investors need a lot more to be excited about - a stock at a 10x multiple needs miracles to keep that valuation alive.Competition is one of the main bogeymen standing in Workday's way. When Workday was first starting out in 2006, after its founder Aneel Bhusri was ousted from the hostile acquisition of PeopleSoft by Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), it had few competitors in cloud-based human capital management [HCM] software. Workday ended up getting the last laugh from the PeopleSoft takeover, as more and more companies shifted away from on-prem HR software to cloud-based HCM. Workday grew quickly to 1,500+ customers and nearly $2 billion in revenues, with few competitors blocking its path. This is one of the reasons its stock has been afforded a high multiple for so long.Now the story is different. Workday is still spitting out good quarters, but for how much longer? Neither HCM (Workday's primary category) nor ERP (its second, which it launched a year after its founding) are growth categories. Almost every enterprise has software solutions in place for their accounting books and for their people. And now they have more vendors to choose from, many who are undercutting Workday on price.This article will touch on some of Workday's new competitors and why they pose a threat to its business. Workday is still a pioneer and a technology leader in HCM, but its valuation is outdated - even if the stock pulled back to 8x revenues (~$85), the stock would still be trading a turn above its peer averages. Stay away until that happens.The name Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) should strike fear into the heart of any competitor. As you may well know, Microsoft is the world's largest software company and, aside from being king of operating systems, has recently also made a push into the application sphere - and one of its targets is Workday.Microsoft launched its wide-ranging applications suite, Microsoft Dynamics 365, in late 2016. Among its core capabilities are HR solutions (named ""Dynamics 365 for Talent"") and ERP solutions, packaging financial management software along with supply chain and operations capabilities.Workday keeps its pricing pretty hushed, but a cursory Google search hints that a typical Workday contract costs between $100-$200 per employee, per year. Typical deployments are often in excess of $1 million in billings per year.Dynamics is priced much more reasonably. Applications in the suite can be purchased a la carte for the prices below:Source: Microsoft Dynamics sales websiteTalent, the primary Workday competitor, sells off the shelf beginning at only $40 per month per user - meaning it only charges for the HR and IT professionals who will be using the app, not every employee in the company. This alternative (and much cheaper, in most situations) pricing model is a major threat to Workday. When an IT buyer is choosing between an application and its half-price cousin, the lower option is usually coming from an unknown startup catering toward SMBs. Microsoft isn't exactly a low-quality alternative to Workday - it's a huge brand name, at less than half the cost.Note that Workday's Finance and Operations suite, grayed out in the chart above, is only available as a bundle starting at $190, though it comes with more features than Workday, bringing retail ops, supply chain management, as well as HR capabilities into the ERP suite. Workday's competing ERP solution includes some procurement and inventory applications along with core financial management and budgeting, but pricing is unknown.Given that Microsoft is a relatively new entrant to the HCM/ERP markets - it's been available for less than a full year - the impact to Workday is yet to be seen. But it's almost certain Workday will find it difficult to maintain 40%+ growth with Microsoft stalking its steps.Oracle showed it was serious about cloud ERP when it purchased NetSuite in 2016 for $9.3 billion. NetSuite is the leading cloud ERP in the small and midsize business tier, serving 40,000+ customers. Oracle also has a host of its own competing solutions as well. Oracle ERP Cloud complements NetSuite well in the enterprise arena, and in HR, Oracle offers PeopleSoft for on-prem HCM and Oracle HCM Cloud as its hosted solution.Oracle is no longer the underdog in cloud apps, either. As I discuss in this article, Oracle's cloud portfolio is growing at 58% y/y, and its applications are gaining major traction and signing on large deals. IT buyers have warmed to the idea of Oracle in the cloud, and are no longer decrying its solutions as low quality.Oracle's HCM Cloud, like Workday, is priced per employee - but a tad cheaper. Oracle sells its HCM Cloud to midsized businesses for $13/user/month - or $156 per year (see image below):Source: Oracle sales websiteThis pricing seems in line with Workday, but recall two things - first, enterprise pricing is likely to run quite a bit cheaper than SMB pricing based on volume discounts, and second, Oracle's sales tactics are similar to Macy's (NYSE: M) - high sticker price, heavy discounting. Oracle is famously aggressive in pricing, and in a bakeoff against Workday, it will likely slash prices to the bottom of the barrel to win.Like Microsoft Dynamics 365, the combo of Oracle/NetSuite is a new threat to Workday - one with significant resources and brand recognition both upmarket and downmarket.This private company has not only attracted the attention of VCs (the Koch brothers invested $2.5 billion in November 2016), but CIOs as well. Infor offers (surprise) ERP and HCM solutions that compete against Workday's. And unlike Workday, Infor has built its brand around vertical-specific application clouds - with solutions for aerospace & defense, retail, financial services, and a slew of other industries.Workday has developed industry verticalization as well, but it's not Workday's core competency.There are plenty of other private companies in Infor's camp that are raring to have a go at Workday's dominance - Workayday is no longer viewed as the nimble startup in the space; plenty of other startups are preparing to supplant it. The list is too long to describe each in detail, but the names include: Sage Software, BambooHR, iCIMS, Zenefits, and others.Other established companies, smelling profits in the space, have leapt to the fore as well - SAP (NYSE: SAP) has a multitude of competing solutions, and Ultimate Software (NASDAQ: ULTI) has long been a strong competitor on the HR front.Workday reported a good quarter in Q2 indeed - with total revenue of $525 million (+41% y/y) and subscription revenue of $435 million (+42% y/y). Analysts were only expecting $507 million. Guidance also didn't fail to disappoint: the company raised its FY18 outlook to $1.75 billion-$1.757 billion, up from $1.705-$1.720 billion in the prior quarter outlook.But how long can Workday's hypergrowth last? Having been in the space for a decade, it's already penetrated a large portion of its target market, and for the rest it must compete against an ever-growing swath of competitors. HCM and ERP have reached the maturity phase, and Workday's growth must necessarily curve down to more closely mirror the 9-10% growth predicted by IDC in the industry.From a valuation perspective, Workday's stock leaves almost no room for error. It is the singular most expensive of the large-cap software stocks to own, and has maintained its premium multiple over peers for quite some time. See chart below:WDAY EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsAmong large-cap software companies, Workday has maintained a consistent premium, trading three turns above Salesforce, which is similar in growth profile but with quadruple its revenues.Even among high-growth, recent IPO peers, Workday still maintains a healthy premium. Alteryx (NASDAQ: AYX) and Okta (NASDAQ: OKTA) trade at 8x revenues, MuleSoft (NASDAQ: MULE) and BlackLine (NASDAQ: BL) trade at 7x, and plenty trade at 6x and below. Workday eclipses them all.This is a story that needs plenty of gas to keep the fire burning. With so many competitors waiting in the wings, I fear Workday's fire may not burn for much longer.It's the law of nature - once a promising enterprise forges its way into existence, clones sprout up and threaten the original, crowding out the market and squeezing excess profits. Econ 101 students could tell you the same, and the software industry is no exception.Most arenas of cloud apps have reached their twilights, and much of the supergrowth remaining to be found lies in highly differentiated infrastructure software, where clear winners have not yet been named. Within apps, however, there's now four or five solutions for everything, and HCM and ERP are no exception.Workday has remained a fan favorite with investors for long, but its high multiple rests on a shaky foundation. Missed earnings, announcements of yet more new entrants into its core markets, or a wider pullback in tech stocks are major near-term risks to the stock. Resist the temptation to buy Workday just because the only direction it's ever known is up: competition will likely force that to change."
4103162,92586,2017-08-30T17:57:55-04:00,"In line with my projections, Workday reported yet another beat and raise.Whether bulls (on strength of the quarter results and outlook) or bears (on a profit-taking move) will prevail remains to be seen.On sky-high valuation, I feel much more comfortable following Workday from a safe distance.","Has it surprised anyone?This Wednesday, Workday (NYSE:WDAY) reported yet another top-line and EPS beat, along with improved outlook for the remainder of the year. The results are very much in line with my projections that ""Workday (would) not have much trouble beating revenue expectations yet again.""Credit: Workday blogFiscal 2Q18 revenues of $525.3 million exceeded expectations by $18 million, and non-GAAP EPS of $0.24, the best that the company has reported for a second quarter, topped consensus of $0.15. FY18 guidance on subscription revenues got bumped up by +2% to $1.75 billion at the mid-point of the range, suggesting total revenues for the year will likely be up by more than +30% YOY.Subscription sales, now accounting for 82.7% of total revenues (up from 81.9% last year), once again grew by more than 40% in the quarter, in an accelerating trend compared to the tail end of fiscal 2017. Those who are able to see Workday's equity valued conservatively more than likely count on SaaS continuing to grow at a fast clip - and these investors are probably happy to see the strong momentum carried forward.Non-GAAP gross margin of 86.3% expanded significantly, by nearly 150 bps YOY. Total operating costs including subscription expenses were up only +31% on a GAAP basis, helping Workday boost its op margin and possibly pleasing the more value-biased investor like me. SBC-related expenses, however, still represented a whopping $0.59 in cost-per-share outstanding on a pre-tax basis vs. ""only"" $0.45 last year, in part accounting for the 28-cent YOY improvement in non-GAAP EPS.Much because of the sizable non-cash expenses, cash flow remained healthy despite the sizable GAAP net loss of -$0.40/share. FCF of $126.0 million for the first six months of the fiscal year was 16% better than it had been in the same period in fiscal 2017, and might help investors better justify WDAY's valuation on a cash flow basis. Net cash of $1.55 billion has increased 6% from year-ago levels, and now represents 7% of market cap (a bit less than as of the end of fiscal 2017).Despite the strong print, I would not dare make any prediction on the short-term behavior of Workday's stock. It is hard to see any flaw in the results but, as I argued yesterday, ""I fear the market has been showing signs of no longer being willing to buy into significant price strength"".As the charts below indicate, WDAY's valuation multiples, both from a forward EV/revenues and EV/EBITDA perspectives, have been rising fast since around April 2017. And once EPS growth is factored in, WDAY's forward PEG is just about the highest within its peer group, at 4.5x.In after-market trading, the stock has been trading aimlessly in both negative and positive territories, despite the apparent lack of bad news. Whether bulls (on strength of the quarter results and outlook) or bears (on a profit-taking move) will prevail remains to be seen. On my end, I feel uneasy betting on a stock that is valued as richly as WDAY is, and feel much more comfortable following the company's journey from a safe distance.Note from the author: If you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow DM Martins Research.

4099454,101421,2017-08-16T12:50:03-04:00,ERP company Workday has acquired the Pattern Technologies team for an undisclosed sum.Pattern's team had developed knowledge collaboration software that enables businesses to more efficiently handle workload and communication.The acquisition is likely part of Workday's initiative to transition its platform from a closed system to an open Platform-as-a-Service offering.,"Quick TakeERP software company Workday (WDAY) has acquired knowledge collaboration startup Pattern Technologies' team for an undisclosed sum.The Pattern team had created an online business workspace services that integrates email, calendar, and CRM functions within a ‘relationship graph that spanned across millions of people and companies.’Workday will likely utilize Pattern's expertise as part of its ‘open platform’ initiative that seeks to broaden its group of partners, developers, and independent software vendors by changing its business model to a larger ecosystem approach.Target CompanyRedwood City, California-based Pattern was founded in December 2014 to develop an online workspace focused on making sales teams more productive through its automated meeting confirmations and machine learning capabilities.Management is headed by co-founder and CEO Derek Draper, who was previously an operations manager at Google (GOOG) X and head of field operations at Wildfire as a subsidiary of Google.The company’s ‘special sauce’ is a recently-developed set of machine learning tools that analyze a sales rep’s email, calendar, and CRM activity to highlight risk or provide momentum signals about their pipeline of leads to enable the rep to better understand and capitalize on changes in prospect activities.Pattern raised one disclosed funding round of $2.5 million from early stage venture capital firms Felicis Ventures, First Round Capital, and SoftTech VC.Acquisition Terms and RationaleNeither company disclosed the acquisition price or terms. Workday didn’t file an 8-K and didn’t provide any information on a change in financial guidance, so I presume the amount was not material to its financial condition.Given the small amount of funding and small team, the deal was likely valued on an 'acquihire' basis, so was probably for $10 million or less in total consideration.Frequently, corporate acquirers of young companies will compare the cost to build the capability themselves or to buy it, the ‘build vs. buy’ comparison. The advantage of buying the technology is reduced risk of development and faster time to market, assuming integration risk is minimized which usually can be quantified by the technical teams from each firm.As part of the acquisition, Pattern will be ending the service to its existing customers on August 11.The acquisition is likely part of Workday’s recent major initiative to ‘open up’ its platform, which it announced in July 2017.As CEO Aneel Bhusri stated in the company blog post,Customers had been asking for Workday to open its platform so that they can bring their supply chain ecosystems into their operational workflows.Pattern’s collaboration software capabilities fit into this initiative by facilitating communication across various teams and functionalities within Workday’s customer base.And Workday benefits with its ‘open platform’ initiative by creating a more defensible business ‘moat’ that isn’t hemmed in by its legacy, internal ERP focus.The deal is a relevant signal about management’s intentions to transition from a closed system to an open ecosystem approach to ERP.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, insider activity, and IPOs.

4079330,98236,2017-06-06T18:49:14-04:00,"Workday reported the results of its fiscal Q1 last week.The results were a noticeable beat in terms of both revenues and EPS.This article plumbs a bit below the surface to see just how much of a beat Q1 results really represented.There were some spaces and uncertainties and perhaps downright disappointments in sub-headline numbers.Guidance, as well, was less than stellar and in combination with an extended valuation makes Workday's shares a name that I would avoid.","Workday: The company hasn't yet figured out to work towards real profitabilityLast week Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) announced the results of its fiscal Q1. The results in terms of expectations were a significant beat. Revenue growth accelerated from 35% in Q4 to 38% this past quarter. That is the third quarter in a row in which the company reported accelerating revenue metrics. Overall, revenues which had been forecast to be about $468 million came in at $480 million.The company reported improvements in non-GAAP margins and in cash flow although the free cash flow metric used by Workday excludes the costs of the company's new headquarters facility. It really doesn't matter from the point of view of an analyst or investor. No one buying these shares is doing so because of the company's anemic free cash flow yield of 1.3% and it would take many years before the company generates enough cash flow for its methodology to be that important.Workday shares have been outperforming the market noticeably. The shares have appreciated 56% year to date. That is double the rate of the IGV which has appreciated by just 28% over the same period. Perhaps it is time for this very hard working stock to take some time off. Perhaps it is time to look a bit below the surface to see just how successful the company might be and to examine risks that make it difficult to recommend the shares even for a growth junky like this writer.The share price appreciation has made it impossible for many analysts to continue to recommend the shares. It takes a Herculean effort to try to lift up the weight of the world and it takes a Herculean effort to lift up this company's valuation. At the moment, of the 40 analysts covering the name and reporting their recommendations, 14 rate the shares buy or strong buy and the other 26 rate the shares hold or sell. For a change, I find myself in agreement with the First Call consensus rating.What could be wrong with that picture? In some ways, there isn't anything terribly wrong with Workday's operational performance. If valuation weren't so extended, it probably would be a name to consider in a high-growth portfolio. But with valuation at levels that seemingly discount the hereafter, it behooves prudent investors and analysts to look a bit beneath the surface to see if there are elements that might be signs of future growth deceleration. I think I see a few. Many investors will doubtless find some of the issues I highlight as nit-picky. These columns are intended, for the most part, for individual investors. When it is one's own money, and not a recommendation about how to build a high growth portfolio for a financial institution, it is far more important, I think, to be nit-picky. There is nothing in Q1 results that is shockingly bad or a smoking gun - there are elements of discordance both in terms of performance and guidance that probably need further attention.Before embarking on an examination of what happened in Q1 and perhaps why, it is well to remind readers that Workday has been an early adopter of ASC 606, a new accounting standard. The standard has the effect of deferring certain costs, most particularly sales compensation. while accelerating the recognition of revenue from certain kinds of customer contracts. Eventually, of course, it doesn't impact anything other than timing, but in the early years of adoption it is going to increase reported profitability and to move certain expenses to the balance sheet. The precise impact of ASC 606 was not disclosed for the quarter but it probably added about 2% to operating margins, overall. The company has restated the prior year so both sequential and year over year comparisons are valid.Being Nit-PickyWhy be so nit-picky? Well, for one thing, not only are WDAY shares up 56% YTD, they have continued that pattern through the last three months. WDAY shares have appreciated by more than 25% in the past 90 days. That is almost twice as fast as the appreciation of the IGV (13.8%) or the QQQ (13.7%). When trying to consider if that kind of performance is justified, it is important to look under rocks and into crannies. It would take very little to see some of that positive alpha erased.And WDAY is valued as though its current performance was likely to persist for far longer than the company is forecasting. With the current spike in share value, the company now has an enterprise value of almost $19.7 billion. Based on the company's current sales forecast, the EV/S is now 9.6X. As I will show below, the company is currently forecasting that top-line growth is going to decelerate to 26% by the end of the year. It is, I think, more than a bit difficult to square substantially decelerating growth and an EV/S multiple of 9.6X. If it sounds like a bubble - well that is because it probably a bubble.Q1 was, in most regards, a commendable quarter for Workday or frankly any company to ever record. I think, however, that carefully considered there are issues that ought to concern investors. Overall, the company has increased its estimated revenue growth for the current calendar year from 27-29% to 29%-30%. That really suggests a very noticeable deceleration in growth as the year progresses. Q1 was a beat of $12 million. Raising full year revenue growth estimates by about 150 basis points is the equivalent of $30 million. So, if the forecast is accurate, then, sequential growth is going to show faster levels of deceleration than had heretofore been expected.In Q2, the company is forecasting that revenues will grow by 5.6% (using the mid-point of guidance) from Q1. In fiscal 2017, the sequential growth between Q1 and Q2 was 9.3%. And, at the time, that was considered to be a disappointing quarter and the shares reacted negatively. One can wonder how and why this growth deceleration might happen but it surely is not indicative of the strong growth portrayed by management in the press release and in the conference call. Again, 90% of the company's revenue comes from its balance sheet so why the deceleration forecast this quarter is a bit more of a conundrum.The company is forecasting sequential growth of 3% and 5% in Q3 and Q4 respectively. That is consistent with the current revenue forecast for the year. But $550 million of Q4 revenue (that is what the forecast equates to in dollars) would be a growth rate year on year of 26%. I think it is fair to say that if Workday's revenue growth decelerates to 26%-and that is the specific forecast the company has made-the share valuation would be way out of line. At best the shares might be flat and more likely, depending on market valuations for IT shares, the shares would react very negatively, particularly if guidance was for slower growth yet in fiscal 2019.As part of the earnings release, Workday announced that its international revenues, now 20% of the total had grown 58% year on year. Again, this is one of those case of the glass being either half full or half empty. If international revenues grew by 58% and represented 20% of total revenues, and total revenues grew by 38%, then simple math suggests that revenue growth in North America was about 29%. Given the overall contraction forecast in percentage growth, in essence WDAY is forecasting growth in North America will fall to the mid-teens by the end of this fiscal year.Might that actually happen? It is what the company has forecast and it is what is embedded in the current level of First Call consensus revenue expectations. I really don't think mid-teens growth in the company's primary market would be acceptable to many current investors. If the company really expects its North American revenues to grow by only mid-teens percentage at the end of the year it might suggest that something is deteriorating, either in the selling motion, the market or competitively or a combination of all 3.I have pointed out in past articles about many other companies, that no one really believes articulated or published forecasts when they seemingly make little sense. But on the face of the forecasts, which show such sharp contraction in expected future percentage revenue growth, I think a deep orange flag is warrantedOne of the more puzzling aspects of the company's earnings call presentation had to with its commentary regarding the growth in the company's deferred revenue balance and the growth in the annual recurring revenue metric. Last quarter, the company stopped giving a forecast for bookings, saying that the changes in the deferred revenue balance no longer appropriately tracked the progress in the company's business. Most people yawned there is some validity to suggesting that the length of contracts which can significantly change deferred revenue in a given quarter is not a valid metric to use in tracking demand or sales execution. This quarter the stew got to be a bit more of a mystery, at least for this writer.Deferred revenue was up 37% year on year. The problem with that metric is that it was flat sequentially and non-current unearned revenue declined 6%. Overall, the total deferred revenue balance fell sequentially and negatively impacted quarterly cash flow. That is partially a function of the proportion of customers paying for more than one year of service in advance and is almost certainly why the company has chosen to stop releasing bookings data.The company now has $4 billion of committed subscription revenue of which two-thirds is committed in the next two years. The company deliberately declined to disclose the year on year comparison of that metric. More than 90% of the company's subscription revenue comes from the balance sheet. And we know that over the past couple of quarters, the company has won some very large contracts, particularly with both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and with Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT).What is puzzling, under those circumstances, at least to me, is that deferred revenues are flat and long-term deferred revenues have declined. What is also puzzling is that if bookings were as strong as management suggested, why it was unwilling to discuss whether there was any growth in the license backlog year on year? And one is finally left speculating about why it is that sequential growth, for both Q2 and for the balance of the year has been forecast to contract so significantly. Is it possible that things are less healthy for this company than management suggested? Is it possible that the issues that are seemingly impacting growth in North America are ones that need more explanation than the company provided.The company said that ACV growth was the fastest in three years. One wonders how to square that statement with the idea that growth in revenues is set to slow significantly and that the level of license revenue backlog probably did not increase. I might, if I were a more uncharitable writer, actually quote the answer given to the question of squaring the conundrum - needless to say it was asked. Suffice to say, it would not be terribly enlightening and in point of fact was totally off-point. The CEO really can do better than to call out the fact that the name of the interlocutor is the same as that very valuable commodity (Kash) which WDAY is no longer focused on collecting. I doubt that anyone on the call was really satisfied with the answer and I know I am not.Again, were the shares not valued at the levels they are, perhaps these unknowns and points of dissonance would matter less. But when investors pay the cost they do for these shares, just about everything needs to line up to perfection. And I think it is hard to make the case that they are doing so at this point.Wondering about costs, margins and cash flowYesterday, I got a comment on one of my articles from an investor wondering about stock based comp and why it is that I use that in these articles. The basic reason I do so is because it is the most common way analysts value company's and all of my comments aren't going to change that. But what I can do is to point out the issues in a company such as this which consistently reports earnings beats and which almost as consistently builds those beats on the back of stock based comp.The company reported that non-GAAP EPS rose from $0.06 to $.31. That looks like a pretty sizeable achievement and viewed holistically, the company is taking steps to manage costs more effectively. But costs are still rising substantially.It isn't as though this company has gone on a spending diet, it has eschewed extra offerings of pasta and cream pie-or maybe a bit less potato salad with the barbecue. Overall, the improvements are quite a bit less sizeable in terms of a GAAP presentation. But it should be noted that the improvements in GAAP cost ratios are mostly a function of the company exceeding previously forecasted revenue. Q1 was a quarter of over attainment, or so it has been portrayed. But the margin upside required a significant revenue upside. No beat on revenues, no margin improvement. Given the concerns I have with regards to this company's actual growth, I have to wonder about the sustainability of margin improvements.All of the following numbers unless otherwise indicated are GAAP. I will deal with stock based compensation later. Gross margins rose from 69% to 71.5%. Part of that is the more rapid growth of subscriptions revenues which have higher gross margins compared to services revenues. Gross margins, because of that factor, can still continue to increase.Research and development expense were unchanged at 41% of revenues. It is almost impossible for any company to spend 41% of revenues on research and development and have a financial model that is satisfactory to investors. And yet, this company may need this kind of spending in order to try to develop product differentiation and a larger product footprint given the level of competition it faces.Sales and marketing expense fell from 38% of revenues to 33% of revenues. A significant component of the improvement probably relates to the adoption of what is called ASC 606 which has the effect of reducing sales commissions recognized on larger deals. Even though both periods have been adjusted for the new framework, it is very likely that sales and marketing expense as reported was substantially benefited by the new accounting standard.The general and administrative cost ratios fell from 11.8% to 10.5%. Altogether, the company did improve its GAAP expense profile by 1000 basis points, and that is a decent achievement even if part of it most likely relates to the current adoption of ASC-606.There are substantial opportunities to improve expense ratios; few companies at this scale choose to spend 41% of revenues on research and development. And yet identifying that category as a potential source for increased profitability is fraught. The issue for this company is that so far it has been unable to achieve dramatic revenue growth from its offering in financials. It seems reasonable to suggest that it needs to spend outsized amounts on research and development in order to enhance its financial offering and to try to offer users something differentiated with the financials offered by Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and by SAP (NYSE:SAP).Regardless of the company's cost controls, one area that remains troublesome to me and others is stock based comp. The company continues to dilute its shareholders at ever increasing rates. Stock based compensation expense ballooned from $.38/share last year to $.53/share this year. Outstanding shares grew by 5%, and would have grown more than that had the company been achieving GAAP profitability. About the only positive thing that can be said about stock based comp expense is that it increased only marginally between Q4 and Q1, but it continues to increase. And so far as that goes, according to the company's forecast, stock based comp is set to renew its climb on a relative basis.Workday is improving its expense ratios in most categories. But again, it should be noted that the company is forecasting that the margin improvements in Q1 are something of a one-off. Overall, non-GAAP margins in Q1 were 12.7%. They are forecast to be between 6-7% for Q2 and the balance of the year. Non-GAAP margins are expected to trough in Q3 at 4%. This forecast, should it be achieved, would represent progress compared to the prior fiscal year. But not all that much progress. Last year, the company reported that non-GAAP margins were 1.9%. The adoption of ASC-606 will add 1.9% in margins. The overall margin improvement, therefore, on an apples-to-apples basis is more like 250 basis points.Margin improvement however it happens is good. But with shares so highly valued as these which are still reporting a significant level of GAAP losses, I have to wonder if 250 bps improvement in margins is quite enough.Cash flow and balance sheetFor some time now, analysts and this writer from time to time, have tried to justify this company's valuation based on its cash generation. The company's cash generation is primarily a function of stock based comp and the growth in deferred revenues. Cash flow from operations (CFFO) this past quarter grew by 11% year on year and just 6% looked at on a per share basis. The major reason why this company's CFFO had such a modest improvement was the decline in its deferred revenue balance. A year ago in Q1, deferred revenues contributed $25 million to CFFO. This year the decline in the balance cost the company $21 million in cash flow. I have gone through several of the metrics that the company now uses in order to explain its view of revenue generation. I have nothing against any of them. As commented earlier, some of them have been presented without relevant comparisons. But for anyone looking at this company and the cadence of cash flow, deferred revenues is a key variable. If management, as it said, is no longer focused on collecting cash and cash flow stagnates, that is going to present problems for share price valuation.Overall, the company is forecasting that CFFO will rise by 20% this year. That would bring CFFO to $418 million for the year, a $70 million increase from the prior year.Last year stock based comp of $372 million was 107% of cash flow. The company, at the mid-point of its guidance range (basically it has forecast that the GAAP margin will be 26% below the non-GAAP margin - I used 26% of forecasted revenue of $2.043 billion, therefore, for this calculation), is forecasting that stock based comp will rise to $532 million. That would be 135% of CFFO.Stock based comp is not a cash expense, to be sure. That said, most investors probably are not going to be thrilled to see such a large increase in stock based comp and to find that the increase represented more than all of the growth in cash flow.Although outsiders do not have all the tools they need to make a dispositive judgment, it seems likely that the reasons for the deterioration in cash flow ratios has to do with declines in the rate of increase or actual real declines in the deferred revenue metric and smaller improvements in GAAP margins ahead. I would have to say that it is a little bit more than a nit to find that CFFO is not growing other than because of increases in stock based comp.The company calculates its free cash flow in a manner that excludes the expense of its new building on its Pleasanton campus. I am hard pressed to understand why it should use such a methodology. It is more or less always building out its campus or acquiring other bits and pieces of real estate. But I will use the company's preferred cap ex metric which is forecast to be $160 million. At that level, free cash flow generation would be $260 million. That is a free cash flow yield of 1.3%, one of the lowest such metrics seen in amongst IT companies of this size. The company does plan to spend an additional $175 million this year on its real estate. I imagine that real estate and facilities investment will remain elevated into fiscal 2019 when the company finally occupies the latest additions to its campus. But it hardly matters a great deal to investors. No one buying the shares is doing so because the free cash flow yield is 1.3%. Based on the current trajectory of growth and profitability, it will be many years before the company generates enough free cash to justify itCompetitionIt is always speculative to write about competition in the software world. There are publications such as ""Apps Run the World"" that specialize in market research just in this field. Their current view is that SAP is a leader in the space with a 10% share followed by ADP (NASDAQ:ADP), Oracle and then Workday. There are many other competitors, really too numerous to mention. IBM (NYSE:IBM) is in seventh place with a 4% share.There are several issues that make forecasting market share changes a fraught exercise. For one, WDAY is a pure cloud vendor. The cloud component of HCM is growing and the on-prem component of HCM is flat or shrinking. So, looked at holistically, it is likely that Workday is growing its share but is it doing so within cloud? That is a far trickier question to answer.Workday maintains that its position in cloud based HCM is very strong and essentially unassailable. The company's CEO is always good for a quote on the subject and this last conference call was no different.The company has announced several very large transactions of undetermined scope and duration so far this year. These include deals with Wal-Mart and Amazon. The Wal-Mart deal is for at least a million seats. I am not altogether sure in what bucket the company is reporting these large deals. If they are part of the $4 billion of lease back-log, I would like to know what is the status of the rest of the company's business. They are clearly not in deferred revenue.The link suggests that at the least, SAP is growing quite rapidly in this space-and it is possible that SAP's cloud solution is growing as fast or faster than the cloud solution offered by Workday. While SAP was the incumbent in the Wal-Mart transaction, overall it would be difficult to gainsay the success of SuccessFactors since it has belonged to SAP. As to Oracle, well it has loads of Taleo customers who doubtless will wind up buying significant amounts of the company's cloud based HCM technology. If I could somehow look at Oracle's HCM business in the cloud, look at the base of Taleo and compare it to Workday's growth rate, I might imagine that Workday's gains in market share measure in that way are of an overwhelming kind.ADP has a considerable market share and certainly offers an HCM solution that has more or less swept its SMB customers. It believes it will go on to capture it mid-market clients as well. While ADP's competitors are likely to have more functionality, for some users, ADP's cloud solutions are attractive.The real problem for a company such as Workday, however, is that HCM as a whole, is a saturated market with nominal growth available in the large enterprise space where most of Workday's success has come. The company said during this last call that it had significant success against Ultimate (NASDAQ:ULTI) and NetSuite. I would guess that success against NetSuite is a function of that company's recent merger with Oracle. But even if Workday took all of NetSuite's customers it really would only sustain growth in the HCM space for a couple of quarters - NetSuite HCM simply isn't that large.NetSuite is more focused on selling ERP and will ultimately want to sell whatever it is that will make up Oracle HCM. But it has never attempted to sell its customers on a specific HCM stack - that is why it had a partnership with Workday.Overall, HCM software revenue is showing growth that has slowed to 5% or less. I might speculate that part of the decline in North American growth seen at Workday and forecast by the company stems from a falling percentage of growth for HCM even in the cloud. I simply haven't the tools to make a dispositive statement regarding how that works - and really even the CEO of the company acknowledged that his long-term growth vision in this area is murky.And that brings us to the still major unknown for this company and that the ultimate fate of its initiative in selling financials to new customers and to its HCM user base. It is a question focused on during all of the conference calls the company holds and all of the conference presentations that it makes. But despite analyst efforts to elicit some kind of cut and dried answer from management, there is yet to be a dispositive answer. Financials remain significantly smaller in terms of total revenue for this company compared to HCM. And that percentage apparently hasn't really changed. Financials, depending on their definition, are a far larger target market than HCM - perhaps by a factor of 4 or 5. On the other hand, it is growing very slowly. Low single digits at best. But it is a target market of over $100 billion and it represents a very broad opportunity for this company.Workday's opportunity here in that users are abandoning legacy systems for the cloud, opening up competition in many accounts for the first time in many years. It is, I believe, very difficult to build differentiated financial apps. It is an area in that has seen innovation, but not in its core but more in analytics and big data analysis, areas that are not specific strengths for Workday. Workday has announced planning and analytic modules for its financials and these are said to be achieving significant success. But without lots more transparency than this company is willing to offer on the subject, one is left guessing and wondering. Projecting is hard in the best of circumstances but projecting when one doesn't know the base or the growth of that base is simply not a reasonable exercise.As mentioned at the outset, almost none of this would matter all that much if WDAY had a less extended valuation. This is a good environment in which to sell enterprise application software, butter than has been seen so far this decade. I have no reason to believe that WDAY will not be able to achieve its articulated goals. I just do not think its articulated goals or even more than its articulated goals are worth its extended valuation. It has to compete in what today are very crowded markets in which it is hard to seriously suggest that the company has a true competitive moat. I think for investors looking at the selection of investments in the hyper-growth IT space there are other alternatives that screen more attractively. I would be surprised if this company can continue to achieve positive alpha going forward."
4103752,98236,2017-09-02T03:07:42-04:00,"Workday reported the results of its fiscal Q2 the other day.The results looked spectacular with strong beats on both revenues and reported, non-GAAP EPS.The details were a bit more ambiguous with a miss on calculated bookings and no real sign of any expense discipline.The company's shares are priced for perfection.The risks inherent in the next chapter of the company's growth, i.e. penetrating the cloud-based financial space, are underrated I believe.","I suppose some might call the sub-headline a snarky question. The fact is that investors are happy with Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY). Workday has proven to be one of the strongest and most durable growth stories of this decade. And so far as that goes, it has also proven to be one of the best performing names in the IT space this year, although it has done less well on a relative basis over a longer time span. So far this year, it is up 60%. That is pretty exceptional performance even within the context of this year’s historic rally in the tech sector, I believe.The problem for many, including this writer, is that the shares have basically traded in a range for about the last three months and the preliminary reaction to the latest quarterly earnings release was muted. One has to wonder if there is much in the way of operational performance that the company can do to get the shares moving in the short term. In the recent past, I have made a similar argument in articles I have written on this site. Much of what I wrote then hasn’t changed much - although the results this quarter were even better than most holders might have expected. Is there some operational metric that this company might report that could make investors and potential investors happier and more enthusiastic about the shares? I will explore the results of the latest quarter in a bit of detail in this article but my conclusion remains. I believe that it will be difficult for the shares to generate substantial additional alpha, not because anything bad is happening at the company, but because the shares already discount any reasonable set of growth expectations.Workday reported the results of its fiscal Q2 this past Wednesday. The results, at least in terms of a cursory inspection, look fantastic. Non-GAAP EPS was dramatically ahead of prior guidance at $.24 compared to prior expectations for the quarter of $.15. The revenue beat was also pretty impressive. Total revenues reached $525 million, up 41% year on year compared to a prior estimate of $507 million. That 41% growth shows a modest reacceleration from growth in the prior quarter of 38%. Subscription revenue growth was about the same both quarters at a very impressive 43%. At this point, Workday is no longer constraining the growth of its professional services and that is starting to have an impact on reported revenue growth.Overall, the company raised full-year revenue guidance by about $45 million. The increase in guidance for the back-half of the year calculates to something like 3%. The company also raised its estimate of non-GAAP operating margin to 8% from its former forecast of 6-7%. The company is forecasting sequential growth of 4% in subscription revenues this quarter…and the math works out such that the implied forecast growth of subscription revenues will be 4% in Q4 or about $470 million.The company is forecasting total revenues to increase to $539 million this quarter, an increase of 2.7% sequentially, with Q4 revenues forecast to be $553 million, up by 2.5% from Q3. That compares to sequential revenue growth for this past quarter of 9.6%. If the sequential revenue growth forecast turns out to be accurate, then of course some investors will not be happy. WDAY’s year-over-year growth rate percentage is going to be impacted by the strong performance in the second half of the prior fiscal year in any event, but sequential quarterly growth of less than 3% is and will probably get the attention of some holders of the shares - and not in a favorable way.Workday, along with many other vendors who use SaaS as their delivery method, has shied away from forecasting bookings in recent quarters. Bookings, as management has suggested, are subject to misinterpretation because of changes in contract duration and particularly because of changes in trends for customer payments. The company now offers an ACV (Annual Contract Value) metric. On the conference call, management suggested that overall ACV was strong. On the other hand, its growth quarter to quarter left some observers a bit dubious.In the meantime, however, the company’s calculated bookings for the quarter were about $550 million. That compares to calculated bookings of $426 million the prior year. That is a growth of 22.5%. Obviously, for those who keep score that way-and I confess that I do - that number is a miss of some magnitude. Q1 calculated bookings were $458 million. Calculated bookings in Q1 in the prior fiscal year were $384 million. That was bookings growth of 19%. Looking back over the last several quarters, it is not immediately apparent that the trend of customers not paying their first year of subscription in advance is anything that started very recently.Most investors are almost certainly going to ignore the bookings miss as an indication of profound weakness in WDAY's selling motion, and perhaps that is reasonable. But for a company that gets almost all of its quarterly subscription revenue from its balance sheet, bookings are of some consequence. The forecasted decline in sequential quarterly revenue growth is probably a sandbag of some amount. But seeing the trend of the change in deferred revenues may be unsettling to some investors who look at sub-headline numbers as part of an overall matrix in terms of valuation. While WDAY's new forecast is going to send estimates of annual growth this year up to about 34%, compared to prior revenue growth estimates for this year of about 31%, the slowing cadence of quarterly revenue growth may leave estimates for percentage growth the following fiscal year unchanged at 26%.Workday shares are mainly held by institutions - 90% of the shares are so owned according to Yahoo Finance. Most institutions are unlikely to sell shares based on second order growth deceleration. For many institutions, headline growth momentum is enough to encourage adding to the name.The latest reported short interest was rather high at 16.6%. Many short sellers will find the results better than they had expected and may not be able sustain a short position. So, there are likely some tailwinds that are benefiting WDAY’s share price. But I think both the bookings performance and the revenue guide are simply too muddy to encourage investors substantially given the run-up of the shares in the few days prior to the earnings release, especially given the current valuation.Investors buy Workday's shares for one reason only and that is expectations of continued hyper-growth. There is no reason at this point to suggest any other reason to own the shares. And below the surface, some of the growth metrics were not what many investors might have been wishing to see. But the earnings beat seemed impressive, so let's take a look at the construction of that metric.Hard to dispute the magnitude of the reported earnings beat. Some of the other numbers involved with expenses - well, they are a bit more ambiguous and certainly forward guidance is not quite what some might have hoped to see in terms of operating margins. Should investors look at non-GAAP earnings. Many do, of course, and it is the only way anyone recommending these shares at a brokerage can write a serious report. But the level of stock-based comp, which was 23% of revenues last quarter remains very elevated, and the company has forecast that stock-based comp will continue to be elevated for the foreseeable future. Stock-based comp rose by 38% this quarter year on year and it rose by an extremely elevated 12% sequentially. To put it another way, that magnificent headline earnings beat in dollars was about $18 million. The quarterly increase in stock-based comp was $13 million. The revenue increase sequentially was $55 million. So, excluding the impact of stock-based comp, the operating leverage of this company in its latest reported quarter was certainly not a number that might cheer many investors - if they were looking in that direction.All of the GAAP operating expense categories saw increases that were a bit less than the increase in revenues year on year, but that were elevated nonetheless and showed significant sequential quarter increases. For example, product development expense rose by 36% year on year but rose by almost 13% sequentially.Sales and marketing costs rose by a comparatively modest 27% year on year but rose by almost 17% sequentially. Even general and administrative costs, while up only 22% year on year were up by almost 9% sequentially. It is not often that one sees that kind of sequential expense growth in a company of this scale. In particular, it seems unusual to see sales and marketing expense show such an elevated level of sequential growth - particularly in the middle of a fiscal year when the influence of commission accelerators is unlikely to play a large role in driving costs.GAAP gross margins compressed a little, mainly as a function of a rather substantial spike in the cost of professional services. Gross margins on services went negative this quarter, which was a significant swing both quarter to quarter and year on year. The CFO said that the decline was seasonal; there is some validity to that contention to be sure. On the other hand, given the substantial sequential increase in services revenue, the negative gross margin rate this past quarter cannot be considered a welcome development; in the year ago quarter, services gross margins were marginally positive.Overall, the company reported non-GAAP operating margins of 9.3%, which compare to non-GAAP gross margins of 12.7% the prior quarter. I think some investors and analysts as well as this writer have to be surprised just how little operating leverage the model showed last quarter, particularly given the significant revenue beat. Overall, GAAP margins in the quarter were a loss of 15.5% compared to a loss of 23% last year and compared to 12.5% the prior quarter.The company is now forecasting full-year non-GAAP operating margins of 8% and Q3 non-GAAP margins of 5.5%. That math is such that the company is forecasting that Q4 operating margins will be about 3.6%. The company is forecasting that stock-based compensation for the year will be about 24.5% of revenue; it ran at 22.7% of revenues in the first half of the year. In other words, stock-based comp is going to rise faster than revenues in the second half of the year in order. At the current level of revenue growth the company is forecasting, margins will actually show negative leverage for the balance of the year, particularly looked at on a GAAP basis.Just how real is the guidance and how concerning should it be to shareholders? It is never easy to take a press release and a conference call and come up with specific answers to concerns such as these that I have tried to highlight. I assume that the forecast for expense growth is quite real - the company has budgets in place to grow its staff, typically the most salient cost driver in a software company. The CFO said specifically that the company will continue to prioritize growth over near-term margin improvement. The sequential growth in expenses in Q2 was driven by on-boarding 500 additional employees bringing the total to 7,400. Hiring is also correlated with the growth in stock-based comp - developers expect a decent stock award as part of a package that is necessary to woo them to join a new company.It is a bit harder to render a judgment on the probability of the slowdown in sequential quarterly revenue growth the company has forecast. One reason why analysts like to look at bookings or ACV growth is to test for the level of realism in the projections of a business. The fact that bookings have been relatively weak for a couple of quarters, and that ACV growth this quarter was below some expectations, might suggest that the forecast the company provided was prudently realistic. Most recently, the company has had substantial success in developing its overseas business. Last quarter, international revenues grew by 59% to $106 million. On the other hand, revenues in the US showed more muted trends, growing at 37% last quarter. I am not sure if management is reflecting some concern that the growth rate outside the US is likely to contract in percentage terms going forward from the current exceptional level.Summing up this section, I think it is fair to reflect that for a company with the kind of expectations embodied in Workday’s valuation, there were some ambiguities both in terms of guidance and in performance during the current period that might deter investors from making new commitments. When valuation is high, it seems more prudent to pick all the nits one finds; if valuations were lower, one would be able to come to a different conclusion.I have written about Workday several times and in those articles have gone into some level of detail regarding the company’s product strategy and competitive positioning. Not all that much has changed recently. Over the last several months, Workday has announced some fairly spectacular wins in its core HCM space including most notably Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), a takeaway from SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). This quarter’s big win was a word wide transaction at Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY), also a take-away from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). In addition to Siemens, other large HCM wins during the quarter included Nordstrom (NYSE:JWN), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Humana (NYSE:HUM).The latest Gartner review of the HCM space was issued in mid-August. WDAY, as has been the case for some time, is the leader, with SAP and Oracle following based on what is described as its ability to execute. The three vendors are more or less tied on the axis described as completeness of vision. WDAY is liked above the average by its users - it is apparently tops in user satisfaction overall and that is a testament to the company’s leadership and quite frankly to opportunities provided by its two principal competitors in that regard. On the other hand, it apparently charges premium prices. At this point, WDAY has said that it has more than 30% of the Fortune 500 as customers.The HCM space is not growing at 40%, or anything like 40% at which WDAY is currently growing. In fact, in the study linked here, the growth of the HCM space is forecast to have a 9% CAGR over the next five years. The growth this company is enjoying and will continue to enjoy is coming because of users migrating to the cloud and putting their HCM system up for competitive bid. During the course of the conference call, management said its guess was that about 50% of the Fortune 500 have not yet made a decision yet about how they migrate HCM to cloud.This is one of those case of the glass half full. According to WDAY's management, it has so far gotten 60% of the deciders who have migrated to the cloud in HCM. And about half of the decisions have been made. There is still plenty of runway, but runway is not the same thing as growth. I am sure that the leaders of both Oracle and SAP, looking at the statistics regarding HCM market share, are gnashing their teeth at this point. Are they prepared to lose another 60% of their remaining business in HCM to Workday? (Essentially, that is what the statistics as WDAY portrays them suggests, i.e. that WDAY has a market share of 60% on business among large users moving to cloud-based HCM). SAP in particular paid an enormous amount to buy SuccessFactors, its HCM horse these days. As compared to a few years ago, both SAP and Oracle do have competitive products, and they almost certainly have a willingness to discount.Yes, the comment of the CEO on the conference call to the effect that there is tons of market ahead is almost certainly correct. But is it tons more than it has been, or is the remaining half of the business yet to be decided amounts to about the same amount of contracts that this company has already been rewarded? If the growth in HCM slows meaningfully as it may well, how does that relate to revenue growth for this company?The question I think for investors is what is the outlook for this company in terms of being able to grow its HCM business at rates necessary to support the current valuation. There are plenty of opportunities, but, at least in the opinion of this writer, not quite enough to support the growth in the longer term that would be necessary to justify the company’s valuation.And that brings us to the outlook for the company’s financials. Simply put, at this point, looking at the numbers, financials have not lived up to expectations. The CEO on this last call spoke to the point as follows: “I would say that and I will be the first to admit I have been overly optimistic when the market would turn for financials moving into the cloud.” The concept is now that users need to finish their CRM projects and their HR projects and then take on finance. “It’s taking longer than we would have liked, but now we feel like we have got the right products and we are well-positioned and beginning to see those big companies show up in the pipeline along with the medium sized ones. “Obviously, Workday doesn't share its pipeline specifics with either investors or analysts. The companies called out as major customers last quarter for financials were enterprises that are certainly not of the headline variety. Large customers last quarter for WDAY financials included Ohio Health, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Giant Tiger Stores and Carlisle (NYSE:CSL). The company will need to close far larger customers than those before its financial solutions start to bolster revenue growth. Financials are said to be about 10% of Workday's business. Margins for financials are said to be substantially negative to the point where they are pulling down corporate margins.As can be seen by the Gartner report linked here, Oracle is the leader in its Magic Quadrant analysis for cloud financials with Workday in second place. SAP is ranked as a niche player because Gartner was evaluating an SAP product called Business ByDesign that is really not mainstream for SAP and is designed for mid and small enterprises. SAP’s mainstream competitor in the space, S4 Hana Financials, is likely to be considered the next time Gartner does an evaluation and is likely to be at least one of the leaders in that analysis.At this point, the market for cloud financial systems has been quite limited with a penetration Gartner says of 8% of the available market as of the end of last year - and that is perhaps consistent with the experience Workday has had. That penetration is supposed to rise to 25% by the end of next year and to 50% by the end of 2020. I think a reasonable question to ask - and one which I can’t quite answer - is whether or to what degree WDAY will be able to poach market share from the established vendors in the space such as Oracle and SAP the way it has done in HCM. Given the fact that both companies are not playing catch-up in terms of technology when it comes to cloud financials, I think the results seen in HCM in terms of WDAY's market share attainment are unlikely - just how different the results will be is something about which many readers and analysts are going to differ with no hope of finding the right answer in advance of the upcoming migration. Sort of like trying to figure out which wildebeests get eaten by which lions and the crocodiles before they start their migration.This past quarter, Workday introduced its Platform (PAAS) solution. This concept allows third party developers to build unique extensions and applications for current Workday customers already using Workday technology. This is a popular model that has been adopted by many vendors and certainly it has proven wildly popular for Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) where its platform has recently been its most rapidly growing cloud and already a major source of revenue. I really do not have a crystal ball as to what kind of growth driver this will turn out to be for Workday.In summing up, I am left without a strong conviction that Workday’s future growth will be quite fast enough to justify its valuation. I think the company’s phenomenal run in HCM is probably reaching an asymptote and could well show noticeable declines in percentage growth over coming years. Financials are a huge opportunity, but Workday’s competitive position is not the same as it was when it entered the HCM space. And the company’s PaaS offering is just getting underway. I would say there are more questions than answers at this point.How reasonable is Workday’s valuation? I think that is really in the eye of the beholder. For me, it is too high because of the ambiguities, the risks and the rapid increase in opex coupled with no discernible trend to reach GAAP profitability in any foreseeable time period. Others may feel that the growth opportunities and the strong headline numbers are adequate to support the valuation. Interestingly, despite many accolades regarding the quarterly performance during the conference call, WDAY's shares are rated a hold by the consensus of analysts who post their recommendations on First Call. And that is not terribly surprising because of valuation and price targets. The average price target is just less than $100. It is hard to justify a greater price target than that, particularly when using the consensus non-GAAP EPS forecast of less than $1/share in EPS and a 25% growth rate.At this point, Workday has a market capitalization of a bit greater than $22.4 billion based on reported outstanding shares and somewhat more based on the shares used in non-GAAP calculations. It has net cash on the balance sheet of about $1.5 billion. The debt on the balance sheet is in the form of convertible notes whose conversion price is significantly less than the current share value of Workday. Presumably the notes will be converted into shares - some in the next year and the balance in 2020. In any event, the current enterprise value of Workday computes to $20.9 billion, and the revenue estimate for the next 12 months is about $2.35 billion. So, the EV/S computes to be about 9X.Obviously that is an elevated number, and probably an outlier if the current growth forecasts are accurate. My belief is that they are, as I tried to point out in this article. Others looking at the headline numbers and the qualitative commentary on the conference call and the track record of the company might reach a different conclusion.The company’s non-GAAP operating income forecast for the current year is now about $168 million. The outstanding share count will continue to rise significantly. At the moment, on a non-GAAP basis, the non-GAAP EPS divisor is 225 million shares. The company does not accrue any taxes in its non-GAAP presentation. That is not unusual amongst the universe of IT vendors reporting non-GAAP results, but readers may want to make their own adjustments for some assumed tax rate in determining valuation.In any event, the EPS calculation for this year comes to $.75, considerably higher than the $.66 EPS estimate shown in the First Call consensus. Accruing a tax rate would obviously change the calculation substantially. The calculation of the forward 12 months' estimate for Workday EPS is probably about $.90, after adjustments are made for the most recent forecast presented during the earnings release. That is a calculated P/E of about of greater than 120X. Clearly, investors at this point are not buying the shares because of current earnings expectations. Will there be some point at which there is a cross-over that sees margins rising? When might that be? Obviously, non-GAAP operating margins at 8% have taken a step up when looked at for the full year. But the current projection shows that Q4 non-GAAP operating margins to be just modestly greater than non-GAAP margins were in the prior year and the projection of GAAP margins is almost exactly comparable to last year’s operating margin/loss margin in Q4.Investors buy these shares for growth and not for how they rank on valuation metrics. But buying shares of this company for hyper-growth seems quite fraught - perhaps not for the next quarter or two, but more possibly for next year.The company forecasts its free cash flow. It does exclude the cost of its new headquarters facility from the calculation. I confess that the justification for the exclusion creates some dissonance in my own mind. The company has been expanding its headquarters for years now as can readily be seen in this link and it probably will continue to do so as it continues to grow. But again, no one buys these shares because of their free cash flow yield. In any event, more than 100% of the company’s CFFO comes from stock-based comp - which is no doubt, a real cash benefit for the company, but not one that most investors value highly I think.The balance of the company’s cash flow statement is unexceptional at this point. Deferred revenues are no longer rising and are not forecast to do so in the near future. The company is forecasting that CFFO for this fiscal year will be about $420 million and it is forecasting capex - excluding real estate investments - of $160 million. That calculates to free cash flow of $260 million, which is barely a 1% yield. Given the trajectories of GAAP operating profits and deferred revenues, the growth in free cash flow is likely to be muted for the foreseeable future.Should investors make new commitments in these shares at this price. I would find it difficult to recommend doing so. Too much is already priced in and there are ambiguities about bookings and the trajectory of the company’s key initiative in cloud financials. This company has a great track record with regards to user satisfaction, but is that enough to steal users at a significant rate as large enterprises migrate their financials to the cloud? To use the old Scottish verdict, “Not Proven.” Very smart, very capable men running WDAY. But there is just too much valuation into which the company needs to grow in order to justify a share purchase recommendation. There will be probably be a better entry point."

The examples have been numerous, as the broad market (NYSEARCA:SPY) continues to have its worse month in 2017 so far.Peer ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is a name that quickly comes to mind. The Santa Clara-based company's all-round beat accompanied by better-than-expected guidance and robust double-digit growth in key metrics was met by a lackluster stock that failed to inch up, despite the absence of any apparent bad news.(Image Credit: Workday blog)In one week, it will be Workday's turn to report fiscal 2Q18 results. I suspect that the richly priced stock will need a nearly flawless quarter and outlook in order to move much further into $100/share territory following the print. The Street expects revenues to come in at $506.9 million, which, if achieved, would represent a 34% improvement over year-ago levels - a step down from last quarter's 38% top line growth rate but a hair above the guided 32.5% for the full year. Judging by the momentum in and the revenue mix shift towards the company's subscription/SaaS business, which was up a whopping +43% last quarter, I think Workday should not have much trouble beating revenue expectations yet again.The Street also sees non-GAAP EPS coming in at $0.15, which would represent the company's best second-quarter performance on record. Driving the improvement in EPS, I expect to see subscription gross margins improve further, as they have in the past couple of quarters (by 2.5 percentage points in fiscal 1Q18). Potential short-term upside could come in the form of lower opex as a percentage of revenues, particularly on the larger and faster-growing product development line.Elsewhere, I expect non-cash expenses (e.g., SBC) and working capital management to keep boosting Workday's cash flow generation. As the graph below indicates, FCF has been rising uninterruptedly for the past couple of years. Continued strength in billings should help carry the momentum forward.(Source: YCharts)My views on Workday remain the same from earlier this year, when I argued that (1) high operating costs with pronounced increase in share-based compensation plus (2) a very richly-priced stock kept me away from this high-growth SaaS play. Since then, shares have been up 15.2% versus the S&P 500's +3.2% - but I suspect the party might be drawing close to an end.Specifically on valuation, I fear the market has been showing signs of no longer being willing to buy into significant price strength. As the chart below indicates, WDAY is the most expensive stock from an EV-to-revenue perspective within its peer group.(Source: YCharts)On a P/E and long-term PEG basis (see table below), WDAY also features as the most expensive name in the sub-sector, and seems to me like one of the most vulnerable stocks to a broad-based valuation pullback.(Source: DM Martins Research, using data from YCharts)I would not dare predict an earnings miss ahead of the print, as Workday seems to be riding an updraft and on track to continue producing impressive top line results in the foreseeable future. But the stock price might be a bit stretched at current levels, particularly if market sentiment deteriorates further, as I suspect it might.Note from the author: If you have enjoyed this article and would like to receive real-time alerts on future ones, please follow DM Martins Research.

4054235,20521,2017-03-10T15:03:48-05:00,"SaaS-based enterprise application services provider Workday may have delivered an impressive quarter, but the market is not impressed.During the recent result announcement, Workday announced a change in accounting practices and a re-organization of its operations – a move that has not gone down well with the analysts.I still think that Workday is a good target for Oracle to acquire as it will give it significant market share in the cloud space.","Workday’s FinancialsWorkday’s (NASDAQ:WDAY) fourth quarter revenues grew 35% over the year to $436.7 million, ahead of the Street’s forecast of $431 million. EPS of $0.07 was also significantly ahead of the market’s estimated loss of $0.01 per share.For the quarter, subscription revenues grew 39% to $365.2 million and professional services revenues grew 16% to $71.5 million.Workday attributed the impressive performance for the quarter to the confusion in the market stemming from Oracle’s (NYSE:ORCL) purchase of NetSuite. According to CEO Aneel Bhusri, the acquisition resulted in “turmoil within the NetSuite customer base” as most companies “chose not to do business with Oracle,” thus opening doors for Workday.Workday ended the year with revenues growing 35% to $1.57 billion driven by a 39% increase in subscription revenues to $1.29 billion. For the year, Workday reported a net loss of $2.06 per share compared with a loss of $1.53 per share a year ago.For the current quarter, Workday expects to deliver revenues of $467 million-$468 million, ahead of the average estimate of $450 million. It forecast revenues of $2.005 billion-$2.025 billion, above the market forecast of $1.99 billion. By achieving revenues of over $2 billion for the year, Workday will become the second true cloud company to reach that milestone, second only to Salesforce.com.Workday’s IssuesDespite the impressive quarter, the market wasn’t too pleased with Workday. It announced plans to restructure its sales team to change the way it approaches the market. Workday has split its North American business into two groups, large enterprise and medium enterprise and has aligned its sales team with this breakout as well. Analysts believe that the re-organization of the sales team is a source of distraction. I am not sure if this is a reasonable objection. If they want to go after the NetSuite customer base, they do need to do so with a different sales model than their regular enterprise sales model. So why are the analysts irritated?Additionally, Workday announced a change in the accounting practices so that it will no longer provide a billings outlook. The change comes as Workday became one of the first software companies to adopt FASB 606 that makes revenue recognition consistent across US industries. Most analysts track billings as a more reliable forecast and believe that the move away from billings will lead to reduced transparency on the company’s prospects.Workday’s Product UpgradesMeanwhile, Workday continued to improve its product offering to attract a bigger market share in the non-human capital management (HCM) segment. It has two new SKUs for the fiscal year 2018 – Workday Financial Performance Management and Workday PRISM Analytics.Workday Financial Performance Management has been released earlier last month and it provides financial consolidation, financial reporting, and management porting. The platform includes a connector that will simplify the integration of accounting entries from third-party accounting and general ledger systems and comes with Workday planning for customers who are not yet ready to replace their legacy systems.Workday PRISM Analytics will be delivered in the fall of this year and is an analytics platform that will provide its customers the ability to merge and analyze both Workday and non-Workday data from multiple sources. It includes a data repository that can store data, arrange governance controls, and prepare the data for analysis.I still think that Workday is a good target for Oracle to acquire as it will give it significant market share in the cloud space. Otherwise, it will keep causing them headaches in competing segments including HCM and now, also, mid-market ERP.Workday’s stock is trading at $82.89 with a market capitalization of $16.6 billion. It had reached a 52-week high of $93.35 in October last year and has recovered from the 52-week low of $65.79 in December last year."
4054166,52472,2017-03-10T12:55:59-05:00,"WDAY has executed fairly well in the HCM space; however, the competition in the ERP space will be a lot tougher, and Workday is not ahead of the game.WDAY is the least profitable among large-scale, enterprise software vendors; currently, there is no line of sight to profitability.WDAY has the highest valuation ratios (e.g., Forward P/E, Price/Sales and PEG) among its industry peers.","With more than $1 Billion in Annual Recurring Revenue, Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is the second-largest pure-play public Software-as-a-Service company, behind only Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). It's relatively small, however, compared to Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP). In the last 12 months, the stock has done OK. Its one-year return is currently 3 percentage points below S&P 500, and the one-month return is 6 percentage points below. Its management team is intimately familiar with the Human Capital Management (HCM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) spaces, stemming from the success previously achieved while heading PeopleSoft. Inspired by the cloud movement, the seasoned team is now spearheading the next wave of software technology.The Market and the CompetitionIf you follow the enterprise software space, you'll notice one thing: Oracle talks much more often about Workday than Salesforce. The reason is simple--the size of the prize is much bigger for ERP cloud applications, where WDAY competes and Salesforce doesn't. IDC estimates that the ERP and HCM markets are almost 4x larger than the sales and service segments of enterprise software (and Salesforce currently controls the sales and service segments). Our worry is that Oracle is way ahead of the game in the ERP segment relative to Workday. Oracle has rewritten all of its ERP applications for the cloud. It did the same for its HCM and Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) applications, which are all now a part of its integrated SaaS suite. WDAY started with HCM, and it now offers some elements of ERP in the cloud, such as financial and payroll applications, though it doesn't offer manufacturing or supply chain. And with the acquisition of NetSuite, Oracle is much more able to effectively address the SMB market segment.WDAY may be one of the most significant players on the SaaS market, but we do not think it has reached Salesforce.com's stature. It is much more vulnerable than Saleforce, because Oracle continues to compete with Workday in the HCM space (both companies claim a good number of Fortune 500 customers), and in the ERP space, it is behind the competition to start with. As far as product maturity, its HCM has gone through several major releases and is a complete offering, but many of Workday's other applications are largely untested, generating minimal revenue contribution (e.g., procurement and supply-chain management). The execution risk for Workday's new products is significant, as the incumbents (Oracle and SAP) have more tenure in these markets. Our thesis is that this could cap Workday's ability to generate a broad demand across industries, putting it into a niche player category.Workday's share in the broader ERP market is approximately 4%, and is small relatively to Oracle's and SAP's, both of which have a share of about 20%. Workday's share in the cloud ERP market, however, is around 20%, but we see Oracle and SAP fighting hard to retain its install base of customers.The ChallengesProfitability for cloud companies deteriorates as growth accelerates because of the recurring nature of subscription revenues. Workday remains very unprofitable and several years from a break-even point. Among public SaaS companies above $5 Billion market cap, Workday has the lowest profit margin. At negative 26%, its 12-month trailing profit margin is 29 percentage points below that of Saleforce.com.To win large deals against Oracle and SAP, the two incumbents in the enterprise software market, Workday often resorts to undercutting their price and offering free migration services from on-prem to cloud, which come at a heavy cost to the company. Its profit margin has declined year-over-year, with no clear line-of-sight to profitability.We also have concerns that stock-based compensation remains heavy at WDAY. To put things in perspective, Workday's share-based compensation accounted for 22% of total revenue, which is significantly higher than that of Salesforce (9%) and Oracle (3%). The slippage of the company's share price could make it challenging for the firm to retain engineers (a problem other SaaS companies such as LinkedIn had already dealt with).ValuationOn a number of metrics, WDAY is valued at the top of the range compared to its peers. Its Price/Sales ratio, standing at 9.19, is almost 50% higher than that of Salesforce.com. Its Price/Equity ratio, adjusted for earnings growth projected over the next five years, is an order of magnitude higher than that of CRM. Our view on Workday's valuation would have been a lot more positive, had we understood the path to profitability. However, with those large multi-year contracts set a low price, and the competition that's heating up in the ERP space, we think the company is somewhat overvalued at this point, with a sizable downside potential.Parting ThoughtsToday WDAY faces the presence of two large incumbents serving the markets that it is trying to penetrate. The incumbents, particularly Oracle, are playing very aggressively. In the ERP space, Oracle has a leg up in terms of the stability, maturity, and functionality versus WDAY, which is perceived as a less mature market player. WDAY also faces risks in terms of burning R&D budget as it enters into new product markets, particularly financials, should customers choose to remain with legacy vendors."
4052657,21815,2017-03-07T10:36:18-05:00,"Cloud platforms open the possibility for significant economies of scale, scope and network effects.When these forces are strong, a virtuous cycle can ensue in which the company's position becomes difficult to dislodge.We are comparing two such companies for their potential on these dimensions.","The cloud is a fast growing part of the economy, and it's not hard to see why as it offers numerous advantages. It's global, continuously scalable, offers the opportunity to outsource part, or even most of company ICT staff and resources, offer new business models for software (SaaS, etc.).One of these new business models is the cloud platform where companies build and partner around their core product in order to create economies of scale, scope and network effects, achieving something of a virtuous cycle.Cloud platforms often command premium valuations and it's not hard to see why:Here we look at one could platform company, Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) and see how it compares to another, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), on these dimensions.Workday Workday is a leading provider of human capital management ('HCM') software platform. It's main competitors are Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), which acquired PeopleSoft and NetSuite, and SAP. They recently landed big customers in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT).Workday offers recurring revenues, these make up the vast majority of its revenues, in Q4:With clients such as Amazon, Wal-Mart, Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB) and BP (NYSE:BP) as customers, there is no doubt that the business model has a global reach.But while Workday offers what is the leading HCM platform, they have not yet reached a position which benefits from economies of scale, scope, or network effects.Growth is decelerating a bit, although the picture is muddied because the full year guidance on revenue growth (27%-29%) is considerably higher than that of cash flow (20%). The latter should be taken as a proxy to bookings growth, data which the company no longer provides due to the early adoption of the ASC606 accounting standard.While sales and marketing have enjoyed a declining percentage of sales, they have moved up in the recent quarter:And research and development is on a continuous increasing path as a percentage of revenueProduct development reached a whopping 45% of revenues in Q3, only to sink a little bit to 44% of revenues in Q4 2017. And there are other worrying trends, like EBITDA and net income:Bulls will likely point out that the company sits on a net cash position of $1.5B and generated $228M in free cash flow in fiscal 2017. Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less certain capital expenditures other than owned real estate projects.Operating cash flow was $349M and this is set to grow to $420M in fiscal year 2018, a 20% growth rate.However, that sounds better than it is, as it doesn't cover stuff like share based compensation, which is, well, rather huge and growing, from $69M or 21% of revenues in Q4 2016 to $106M or 24$ of revenues in Q4 2017 to a predicted 26-27% of revenues in fiscal 2018. No scale here either.With (slightly) less fast growth in revenues to what could be a slowdown in the overall market (according to SA contributor Bert Hochfeld) and several metrics like stock based compensation and R&D actually increasing as a percentage of sales, we're a long way off from economies of scale.Indeed, the operating loss is still a whopping 24.7% of revenue in Q4 fiscal 2017, although that was somewhat less than the 27.8% of revenue in the previous quarter. But still, the trend is up, last year it was 22.9% of revenue.They will also be hiring up to 1500 new people, or 29%. No economies of scale here either, at least not yet.What about economies of scope? Well, the company does offer other applications like financial management, payroll and analytics, so with some imagination one could argue it's a full blown enterprise software package.There are hints of an ecosystem in the professional services (from the latest 10Q):But this too requires a lot of investment (from the Q4CC):Professional Services also are expected to grow at half the rate of subscriptions (15% versus 30-32%), and carry much lower margins.Perhaps it's just us, but we see only the faintest of platforms here. We think the conclusion is justified that Workday hasn't yet achieved economies of scale or scope, let alone having developed a platform for third party applications creating something of a virtuous cycle.That doesn't mean that Workday isn't the leading HCM software Package, it just means there isn't much of a platform effect. Not in scale, scope, or network effects. We also don't see any of that developing in a material sense anytime soon. Some of the required metrics are actually getting worse, not better.In the light of that, the stock commands a rather premium valuation. Let's compare it briefly with a company which we think is further along the platform evolution path, Shopify.ShopifyWe wrote extensively about this company recently (here), so for readers interested in other aspects of this very well run company we refer to that article. Here we just look at the platform economics.Shopify already enjoys considerable economies of scale. While it is still heavily investing in improving its platform, and also engages in heavy spending on sales and marketing (given the competitive nature of its industry), both product development and S&M are declining compared to revenues:The leverage has tapered off though, that's undeniable. But the company is generating more of a platform, in multiple ways:Now, it is likely that cloud ecommerce intrinsically offers more platform opportunities compared to cloud human capital management, but the difference is still notable. With its continuous additions (applications, third-party solutions, partners, sales channels, etc.) Shopify is solidifying its lead and opening a virtuous cycle, while we see little of that happening at Workday.Last but not least, Shopify is also growing much faster than Workday, with revenue growth of 90% in fiscal 2016 for Shopify whilst ""only"" 35% for Workday.Going forward, the growth gap seems to get smaller. Shopify has guided for 50% growth this year whilst Workday has guided for 27-29% revenue growth. But cash flow growth is guided at 20% and this is supposed to be the proxy for bookings.ValuationShopify is already enjoying some economies of scale and scope and seems closer to reaping platform economies, compared to Workday. It is also growing much faster and closer to profitability, as losses are decreasing.Shopify commands serious valuation premiums though, it's trading at over 13 times sales and book value. But Workday isn't all that far off, it trades at over 10 times sales but almost 15 times book value.ConclusionWhile both Shopify as well as Workday are leaders in their category, we think Shopify trumps Workday on a number of metrics and should command a considerable valuation premium which isn't really there at present.We think that for the near future, Shopify is likely to perform considerably better, but keep in mind that neither of these shares is anywhere near cheap."
4050844,98236,2017-03-01T03:11:34-05:00,"On Monday evening, Workday reported the results of its fiscal Q4 and full year fiscal 2017.The results were basically in line, although the early adoption of Rule 606 produced a noticeable increase in earnings and a minor increase in reported revenues.The company reported a minor reacceleration in the growth of revenues, and in particular, subscription revenues.On the other hand, the derived bookings metric continued to decline, although it exceeded the forecasts of some analysts.The company suspended its forecast for both bookings growth and backlog, and its forecast for the growth of operating cash flow was not well regarded by many investors and observers.","Workday: The ongoing lesson of contextWorkday (NASDAQ:WDAY) reported the results of its fiscal Q4 (ended 1/31) on Monday evening. The results were one of those beats that was actually in line with prior consensus expectations. By that I mean given the run-up the shares have recently enjoyed, in which the share price rose by 27% in the last two months, essentially all shareholders and observers were expecting above-consensus performance. It may be remembered that the company, on its last conference call, said sales were slower than expected in November. Then came what some described as an historic win at Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), coupled with some not-so-subtle hints by company management that the November sales slowdown had reversed itself. But despite all of the positive emanations, analysts hadn't chosen to raise their published estimates. The games analysts can play.I do not want to suggest in any way that the company didn't have a great quarter. According to CEO Aneel Bhusri, ""... we delivered the best quarter in company history to close out a very successful fiscal 2017."" There were many positive elements in the quarter. But then too, there were some elements that might give investors a bit of pause in the wake of such a stunning share price appreciation over such a short period. There have been a couple of analyst downgrades this morning, including one from Citigroup, based precisely on those sentiments.One thing to point out, which is sure to be commented on by others besides myself, was the early adoption of ASC 606. WDAY elected to use the new standard to report the quarter and restated the balance of its fiscal 2017 in accordance with the new standard. The impact on revenue was quite small, but the impact on recognized costs, which now reflect a better matching of sales commission expense with reported revenues, is noticeable. Overall, the takeaway is that a significant component of the earnings beat was a result of the early adoption of the new FASB rule, which improved non-GAAP margins by $17 million in Q4, primarily by stretching-out the recognition of sales and marketing costs. As it turned out, the adoption of the standard turned out to be the difference between reporting a loss and a profit in terms of operating income for the year. It tripled reported non-GAAP operating profit last quarter. And the $.08 of reported earnings beat that was reported... well, it came from the early adoption of ASC 606.On the other hand, revenues were a beat of about 1.5%. When a company that has very highly valued shares - as this one does - has a 1.5% beat on revenues and no real beat on earnings, the results are basically viewed as a disappointment. As will be detailed below, issues involving guidance, bookings and inconsistent messaging ignited some significant disquiet amongst the WDAY shareholder base. It was not all that surprising that the shares, vulnerable as they were to any kind of ambiguity in terms of the company's operating performance or outlook, sustained a noticeable pullback.I had written in mid-January, during the midst of the historic share price run, that I thought investors were making more of the WMT win than was really warranted, and that the shares had probably gotten ahead of themselves. Of course, that was back when the shares were $81, and they closed Wednesday ahead of earnings at $90. As I will go on to detail, I simply do not think there are enough good things happening now or likely to happen in the near future to support further share price appreciation, and either share price stagnation or even a pullback ought not to surprise anyone in the wake of what the company actually was able to achieve this past quarter.An anatomy of the quarter; A diagnosis of some issuesJust to reprise a few of the specifics of the earnings release, reported revenues were $437 million for the quarter. Subscription revenues showed a re-acceleration in percentage growth, rising by 39% to $365 million compared to a 38% increase the prior quarter. The GAAP operating loss was $106 million, or 24% of revenues, 150 basis points worse than that metric from a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis, EPS was $.07 compared to a non-GAAP net loss in the year-earlier period. For the year, the company generated $349 million of cash with free cash flow of $227 million. The company has a gross cash balance of $2 billion; its net cash position of $1.5 billion is about the same as the year-earlier level. Not too surprisingly given the large order from Wal-Mart, the company's backlog expanded substantially, rising by 63% year over year to $2.54 billionSome sub-headline numbers that are a bit more ambiguous include the growth of stock-based comp., which rose from $69 million, or 21% of revenues, to $106 million, or 24% of revenues, year on year. This company is far from seeing any leverage at scale, and indeed, is seeing a deterioration in key metrics concerning profitability.The company's deferred revenue balance grew by 15% year on year, far less than the growth in reported revenues. This led to a derived bookings metric of $647 million for the quarter, up from $505 million, or growth of 28% year on year. That result compares to derived bookings growth of 40% for the full year and of 32% growth the prior year.I realize there are various factors, including contract length and the inclusion of renewals, that can impact bookings, and particularly quarterly booking, and it is a reason why some companies do not forecast the metric and claim it is of little consequence. The CFO of this company gave a manful defense of abandoning the bookings metric in the guidance package. But the trend in bookings is not something that can be looked upon with total equanimity. While the derived bookings number may be within prior parameters, seeing the percentage growth decline quarter after quarter, almost regardless of the causes, is just not something many investors are willing to abide by with complacency.One analyst, trying to square his recommendation with the trend of declining bookings growth, chose to suspend his disbelief more or less willingly and described his belief that the use of generous invoicing terms is better than outright price concessions. He believes generous billing terms are impacting reported billings, and that is as plausible a thesis as any. But at the end of the day, there is a basic disconnect between declining billings growth over a multi-quarter period and positive sales activity within the company. Take your poison slow or take it quickly, it is still poison.Some of the specific expense ratios were uncomfortable as well. All of the ratios below are GAAP, and except as noted, do not include the effect of the 606 adjustments.Overall gross margins 69.9%. That compares to gross margins of 69.5% the prior quarter and gross margins of 68% the prior year. The improvement basically relates to a change in mix, with a higher proportion of subscription bookings in the revenue mix. Workday is forecasting a decline in professional services margins in fiscal 2018. Professional services margins were only 18% last quarter, and the company said it needed to invest more in order to insure the success of its customer services engagements. There is much I might say about those figures and that forecast, but I will forebear doing so. The point is obvious.Product development remains am elevated 44% of revenues, which compares to 45% of revenues in the prior quarter. The sequential growth of development spending did decrease to $9 million in the quarter compared to $24 million the prior quarter, but some of that is a seasonal influence. Year on year, product development expense ratio rose from 40.5% to the 44% level. At some point, if one reflects a bit on the trajectory of that metric as a ratio, one is forced to conclude that users need far more new product to buy than is economic to develop.The cost ratio of sales and marketing was substantially impacted by the adoption of the 606 standard. The adoption of the standard reduced reported sales and marketing expense by 8% in the quarter but did not reduce reported expense in the prior quarter. But in any event, sales and marketing spend was reported at 35% of revenue compared to 36% the prior quarter both on the 606 standard. On an apples to apples basis, sales and marketing expense actually rose by 12% sequentially. Overall, prior to the 606 adjustment, sales and marketing expense increased by 100 bps year on year.General and administrative cost fell sequentially, and were 12% of revenue down from 14% the prior quarter. It should be noted that general and administrative costs had risen by no less than 50% year on year in Q3, so the attainment of reducing them by 7% sequentially is perhaps less impressive than would otherwise be the case.Overall, the operating loss, as mentioned earlier, came in at a whopping 24.7% of revenues - up from 22.9% of revenue in the prior year, but an improvement compared to the 27.8% operating loss that was reported in the third fiscal quarter. I wanted to find something nice to say about the financial trajectory of the business, and that was what I could find.Slowing growth - Some thoughts on the evolution of WDAY's businessI think it is fair to say that at this point, the slowing growth at WDAY has much to do with the failure of the company's financial offering to take off the way many observers and investors may have hoped. That is certainly the case in my evaluation of the company now compared to what I had thought in the recent past. In listening and re-listening to the conference call last evening, I was struck by what seems to be a disconnect between the numbers that were reported and the qualitative content of management answers to specific questions. If bookings growth, derived or not, declines sequentially, it is difficult to conclude that WDAY is quite achieving its targets - that is just a bridge too far for this old head.I simply don't think the company's financials are finding traction when the major customer wins during the quarter are called out as Atlas, FactSet Research and John Muir Health. Management talked about its attainment in financials, but they simply were not at levels that inspired confidence amongst either investors or this writer. WDAY has apparently achieved a level of success with its planning module, which it includes in its financials, but planning really doesn't cost users enough and doesn't involve enough seats to move the needle significantly in the context of a company approach $2 billion/year in revenues.WDAY is no longer providing bookings guidance, and is instead forecasting cash flow. I must confess that I can't quite grasp why both metrics can't be provided. I am not conspiratorially minded, but the fact is that bookings growth has been declining significantly, as mentioned earlier. The relationship between bookings, which include increases in deferred revenues, and cash flow, which also is partially animated by that metric, is not very precise. The company will also no longer be providing backlog numbers - although the withdrawal of that metric, particularly in the wake of its current performance, is not as troubling. Other companies in the industry seem to believe the task of forecasting bookings is too onerous, and CFOs have persuaded themselves that bookings metrics are not relevant. I think in the long run, the CFOs, their boards and stakeholders will find that not forecasting an objective metric like bookings, particularly for a subscription revenue company, will lead to lower valuations. You really can't try to fool all of the people all of the time and find continued responsiveness amongst all objective observers.In the event, the company is forecasting that CFFO will be $420 million, up about 20% year on year in fiscal 2018. One of the questioners on the conference call asked if the 20% growth in cash flow was correlated, loosely, to the expected growth in bookings. The answer to that seemed to be in the affirmative. One of the reasons for the performance of shares yesterday is investor unhappiness with that forecast. One doesn't expect that cash flow margins ought to be falling in a company that has reached $2 billion/year of revenues. If bookings growth is really expected to be 20%, it becomes very difficult to recommend the shares; indeed, they ought to be sold. I am baffled that this wasn't more of an issue.There is a basic disconnect between the company's specific revenue guidance of 27-29%, or closer to 30-31%, just looking at the forecast for subscription revenues and 20% bookings growth or growth in CFFO. On the call, a positive analyst - almost a cheerleader - kept pressing the CEO to talk about the potential inflection in the cadence of growth in WDAY's set of financial solutions and to affirm 30% growth on into the future. The CFO and the CEO were both willing to be positive - sort of. I think most objective observers are simply confused and uncertain as to how to interpret the numbers that have been supplied and to attempt to understand what WDAY is actually forecasting in terms of some consistent metric that tracks the trajectory of its sales growth. It ought to be lots simpler than the company is making it... complexity of this kind breeds uncertainty, and uncertainty is going to lead to lower valuations, which were extended heretofore in any event.There are also unanswered questions regarding the transactions the company closed with both Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and, particularly, Wal-Mart. We know they happened. We know that the transactions will ultimately involve lots of seats, given the size of both of these customers. We do not know the pricing of the seats or the ultimate potential revenue generation, the scope of the contracts and the cadence of roll-out and revenue recognition. I wouldn't expect a great deal of granularity on the subject, but not understanding at least some of the specifics makes it more difficult to evaluate both WDAY's operational performance and its actual valuation.The company is forecasting that stock-based compensation will continue to climb, not just absolutely, but as a percentage of revenue reaching 26-27% of revenues, up from 24% of revenues in the just-reported year. I think it is very difficult to make the case that WDAY is managing expenses effectively. GAAP losses as a percentage of revenues are expected to rise, which is something I think many shareholders will not be willing to accept. While I do not necessarily like to repeat hoary old sayings, it seems appropriate to mention the one about losing money on every sale, but making it up on volume.I can, and have, justified lots of things regarding many different vendors in the IT space. The particular projection made by the CFO of 20% growth in operating cash flow, coupled with the projection by the CFO that cash flow growth would remain significantly below the growth in revenue for some extended period, is just a bit more of a stretch than I might try justifying in the context of sky-high valuations. Simply put, it doesn't quite compute, and it is hard to find a set of exploitations that can be interpreted complacently.What's really going on?One of the problems that many stakeholders are going to have with WDAY's earnings release relates to figuring out not just what is happening, but why it is happening the way it is. One can - as some have done - give WDAY the benefit of the doubt. I suppose that is not an unreasonable line of thinking. but it certainly leads reasonable investors to wonder about valuation. The company has anywhere from a commanding to visible lead in the cloud-based HCM market segment in terms of live customer installations, and there is nothing specific that suggests its position in the market is changing. I have linked to one of many forecasts by analysts, but it is obvious that WDAY has some level of leadership in the space.Management has suggested that the competitive offerings of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) do not lead users to good outcomes. There is probably some validity in that comment - again, the question is how much. In addition, management talked about the disruption in what used to be the NetSuite base in the wake of Oracle's acquisition of the company. How much of that is really happening? It is hard to say. Almost certainly, Oracle is going to suggest that things are well along in terms of its acquisition of NetSuite, but the odds are that elements of the integration process have led to disruption - the real question is, just how much.What concerns me is just how low the growth rate of the overall HCM market is, and how large a cohort of the available market has already chosen its cloud HCM vendor. In terms of the linked survey, the forecast given for growth of the overall HCM market for software is 4%. More optimistic forecasts are given by other vendors. This link is to a study that has 72 graphs and 69 figures, so it must surely be accurate. The latest Gartner survey suggests that there is some runway, though not unlimited, remaining for cloud-based HCM deployment. It says only 30% of users have invested in a cloud-deployed HCM suite, while an additional 20-30% of the market will require ancillary products.The antidote to that is new products. In particular, while WDAY is considered to have the most functional set of cloud-based HCM solutions, the same is not yet true in the realm of financial apps.One of the more telling comments during the call was that the CEO claimed WDAY had only been offering a full suite of financial solutions for a few quarters. And yet, there are some people, including this writer, who had really believed the company's financial apps were ready for prime time.WDAY announced that it will be offering Financial Performance Management as a new SKU, and that in the fall of the year, it will be rolling out PRISM Analytics. In fact, the products are so new that they haven't yet been press released by the company or made their way into a Google search. I really have a hard time in understanding how most mainstream buyers can run their businesses using WDAY financial apps without some solution that reports on performance compared to plan, but then, maybe that is me being old-fashioned. And these days, analytics is more or less everything. It is good to know that WDAY is trying to flesh out its financial offering, and disconcerting to realize that it doesn't yet have all of the products to compete with the other two major vendors that dominate the space.So what I see is that growth in HCM is likely to decelerate over the next year or two, while growth in financials has been hobbled by an incomplete product set. I see WDAY stepping up its research & development and sales and marketing investments to deal with those issues. It is why I see the company having forecast an elongated path to real profits, with expense growth running ahead of revenues. It is part of the reason as to why WDAY is still spending 44% of its revenues trying to develop a full suite of competitive products in very competitive spaces. And it is why I think the company waffled to some degree in terms of making substantive forecasts regarding the likely growth in some revenue-related metric, such as annual contract value that would put to rest the question of whether bookings are actually accelerating or decelerating in some objective sense.While I think the company's strategy is reasonable, it can lead to results like those seen today, when share valuation pulls back, and I think it puts a lid on expectations for positive alpha in the short term.ValuationValuation, as has been proven again and again, is no exact science. I think that the elongation of the company's path to GAAP profitability and the markdown of its estimated cash flow growth rate are elements that will serve to depress valuation. Clearly, that is not a view shared by everyone.WDAY currently has 201.5 million fully diluted shares, and the share count continues to grow between 4-5%/year due to dilution. As of the close this day, Tuesday, February 28th, with a closing price of $82.93, the company's market capitalization is $16.7 billion. As mentioned earlier, net cash is a bit less than $1.5 billion, yielding an enterprise value of more than $15 billion. With revenues over the next 12 months forecast to be just greater than $2 billion, that yields an EV/S of 7.5X - one of the higher multiples in the enterprise software space, and one that equates to expectations of 30%+ ""growth"" for some extended period into the future.The company's forecast for non-GAAP earnings is based on an adjusted operating margin of between 5-6% for the full year. This compares to a non-GAAP margin reported this year using the 606 standard of 3.3%. Looked at holistically, as I think appropriate, WDAY reported a GAP loss of about 21% this year and is forecasting a GAAP loss of 22% in fiscal 2018. I find it difficult to describe that financial trajectory as one of achieving leverage at scale; from my perspective, it appears the opposite is true - and I doubt that my opinion is unique in that regard.But regardless of my personal predilections, the guidance provided will produce pre-tax operating profits of $110 million. The company did not provide a tax rate accrual forecast, and of course, it has not paid taxes due to continuing operating losses. I assume that if the company reports operating income of $110 million, it will wind up accruing some level of taxes for the period. I think it reasonable to use a 20% tax rate, leading to after-tax income of $88 million, and using an annual average share count of 210 million due to continuing dilution, that produces a non-GAAP EPS estimate of $.42. I have seen other, higher EPS estimates printed, and perhaps the consensus will be higher. But to a certain extent, reporting that non-GAAP earnings are rising while GAAP operating loss margins continue to increase is a useless exercise. It is, I think, somewhat pointless to talk about valuing WDAY based on reported non-GAAP earnings until such time as the company can at least start to wind down the massive GAAP operating losses which continue to grow - it is simply unhealthy.The company is forecasting CFFO this year of $420 million, which is 20% growth compared to the results of fiscal 2017. It is projecting capex for the fiscal year of $175 million, of which the greatest amount is devoted to WDAY's own real estate projects. Some of the relatively elevated capex being forecast is due to the excess rainfall in the Bay area, which has hindered construction in Pleasanton, the company's new headquarters. Again, no one is buying shares in WDAY because of its free cash flow yield, which is modest to say the least, and is not expected to improve much in the foreseeable future.When one can't find a rational way to make the case that WDAY shares represent attractive value, even to longer-term investors, the issue of consolidation often raises its head. There have been some writers on this site who feel Workday is, or ought to be, a consolidation candidate. I personally think it unlikely because of the integration difficulties a company like this would present to a potential buyer. The company itself, in commenting about the disruptions and turmoil that is said to be ongoing in terms of Oracle's acquisition of NetSuite, essentially pointed out what happens when a larger company attempts to incorporate a very high-growth entity like this one and to enforce cost disciplines. The result is most often unedifying.Workday has been a great disruptor in the applications space, and it continues to be so. It has reaped many rewards for both its vision and its ability to execute. But those qualities can be valued, and the company's future growth prospects can be assessed. I do not think the company is likely to continue to grow revenues in its space at the rates needed to justify the current valuation. I also think until it can start showing a real trend toward profitability, investors are likely to limit WDAY share valuation. There are other opportunities in the enterprise software space that combine growth and at least some trend toward profitability, and those are more likely than this company to produce positive alpha."
4050206,92586,2017-02-27T18:08:35-05:00,"Workday reported fiscal Q4'17 earnings that beat across the board.I expect some share price volatility in the short term, as profit-taking may continue to pressure upside movement.In the long run, I believe the investment thesis remains intact.","On February 27th, Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) reported fiscal Q4 2017 earnings that beat across the board. Revenues of $436.7 million exceeded expectations of $430.3 million, while EPS of $0.07 adjusted primarily for $0.52/share in SBC (share-based compensation) expenses came in better than consensus loss of $0.01. FY18 top-line guidance of $2.00 to $2.03 billion marginally exceeded expectations of $1.99 billion, suggesting about 28% sales growth YOY for the upcoming year that is lower than FY17's 35%.Credit: franktop10.comI was very impressed to see subscriptions (84% of total revenues) grow nearly 40% in the quarter, pointing to slightly accelerating expansion within this segment as fiscal 2017 came to a close. The investment thesis is highly contingent on SaaS performing very well in the next few years until Workday achieves scale and, so far, the company has not disappointed.Cost of subscription sales grew at a slower pace, resulting in gross margin expansion of 50 bps to 84.1%. Product development costs continued to outgrow revenues as expected, with increased SBC-related expenses alone accounting for about $0.25 in cost-per-share outstanding.Despite the sizable GAAP net loss of -$0.52/share driven by growing OpEx, cash flow continues to improve. This time, FCF (free cash flow) reached $77.2 million, a 37% increase YOY. The balance sheet continues to look solid, as net cash remained stable YOY at $1.46 billion, representing 8% of market cap.Source: Company's reportsMy key takeawaysI believe Workday delivered a quarter that will please most investors, subscription revs continue to grow at a very robust pace, while gross margins continue to improve slowly but consistently. Operating costs are still very rich with pronounced increase in share-based compensation, especially on the product development and selling/marketing lines. But I don't expect the market to worry much about cost containment below the gross profit line for as long as top line continues to march forward as it has.In after-market trading, the stock is down about 2.7% despite the apparent lack of bad news. I think the reaction is understandable given the stock's 32% run YTD. Let's also not forget that WDAY trades at 322x forward (FY18) non-GAAP earnings, and the ride is expected to be bumpy given the aggressive valuation. In the short term, I expect some share price volatility, as profit-taking may continue to pressure upside movement.For the longer term, I believe the investment thesis remains intact and on track. Investors that believed in the story before the print should have no reason to change their minds after Q4 2017 results. Should management succeed in capturing a nice chunk of the $65 billion opportunity that it sees coming in the future, Workday investors will eventually have much to celebrate.Source: Workday's Analyst Day presentationOn my end, I feel uneasy betting on a stock that is valued as richly as WDAY, considering how the traditional players in the business systems and analytics space could still throw their weight around to crowd or otherwise shake up the competitive landscape.I will be curious to see how Workday evolves as a company in the next few years, and whether it can achieve scale and significant profitability before competition catches up. However, I feel much more comfortable witnessing this evolution as a spectator, not as an investor.Note from the author: Follow me as I build a risk-diversified portfolio designed and back-tested to generate market-like returns with lower risk.

4037008,98236,2017-01-16T05:27:09-05:00,"Workday announced last week that it won a major deal in to supply Wal-Mart various modules of its core set of human resources applications.The size of the transaction was not specified, but it seems likely that over time the deal will be worth more than $200 million and possibly more to Workday.This is a company whose revenues come in ratably, and large deals take a while before they are fully deployed. Management has chosen not to change its forecast.Workday shares have soared recently based both on this deal and other factors. At these valuations, I see little opportunity for positive alpha.It is a well-run company gaining share and positioning itself to be a major player in cloud applications. But investors would do well to find a less extended entry.","Workday - A big win, a share price pop and now what?I haven't used an American standard song title in my articles for a few weeks now, but something about Workday's (NASDAQ:WDAY) release of its gigantic win at Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) just uncorked my thought process. Strike Up The Band is the name of a musical associated with the Gershwin Brothers that made its Broadway debut on 1927. The story line is about a mythical trade war with Switzerland over a Swiss cheese tariff. Very catchy tunes and perhaps politically relevant these days.But the question is: Should investors be impressed by WDAY's big win, and what might be done with the shares at these levels? I have nothing brilliant to add about the advisability of a tariff on Swiss cheese. I am against a tariff on caviar, which was the burning question of the day as the as the show ended.No, rather than writing further about tariffs and embargos, I will return to assessing just how important the Wal-Mart win might be in looking at the prospects both immediate and further on for WDAY. Let me cut to the chase. It was a great win, it will surely be reflected in the company's derived bookings number, but it simply isn't enough to drive the shares to new highs or to produce positive alpha from this point forward.Just to put the question in context, the shares fell sharply from about $84 to $66 in the wake of an earnings release that disappointed some and baffled others. (Very few companies talk about slipped deals before the end of quarter. WDAY management chose to suggest that deals scheduled to close in November would now close in January. Go figure.) I wrote about the company and its shares positively at that time. But just as the Lord ""taketh away,"" he can give as well, and the shares have rebounded to $81/share, with much of that rebound coming on the heels of an announcement that Wal-Mart has awarded a contract worth 9 figures to Workday. The contract basically calls for Workday to supply Wal-Mart with most of the elements of its Human Capital Management suite. It is certainly the largest order ever won by WDAY, and the fact that it was won in a deal to replace the incumbent HCM vendor, SAP, makes the win even sweeter, I suspect.I do not normally write about particular sales wins or losses. They tend to be random in nature. But given the significant share price gyrations experienced by WDAY shares over such a short period, I felt some commentary might serve a useful purpose for readers.The press release of the event leaves much to be desired. Here it is, in all its unembellished glory:That's it, folks - all of it.What's actually happeningWal-Mart is an immense company with over 2.3 million associates worldwide. Human Capital Management systems, if they are going to be useful, need to encompass the entire workforce, and these days, compliance solutions more or less mandate that users develop and maintain a central repository in which all of their employees and all of their skills are tracked on a worldwide basis. The number of actual users of HCM systems is far smaller, of course, perhaps in the tens of thousands.Needless to say, software vendors prefer to tout the number of employees kept track of by their systems, and sometimes the systems are priced that way. But mainly users pay for seats, or the number of users who are actually able to access the large database of employees.Since we do not know how many seats are encompassed by this transaction, it would be just guessing to try to estimate the annual revenues encompassed by the subscription, and it is not very likely that we will ever learn any more specifics from either Wal-Mart or Workday.The release actually stemmed from a research note by an analyst at William Blair. The William Blair note estimated that annual revenues from the transaction would be in the range of $30 million. The analyst also called out multiple additional contracts with organizations that had tens of thousands of employees.Another note, by a bullishly inclined analyst at Drexel Hamilton, estimated that the transaction would be worth $100-200 million in annual revenues. I am inclined to think that the report, which appeared in Investor's Business Daily, is a misquotation. Software deals that exceed $1 billion have yet to happen, and I do not imagine this one will have produced such a record.It would appear that the William Blair analyst has an informational advantage on WDAY with the ability to provide a significant amount of granularity regarding a company he has covered for some years. Whether or not I agree with his investment conclusion, I think his revenue expectations seems reasonable.The largest software deal of which I have knowledge of recently was a deal sold by Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), which involved 55,000 seats of that company's CRM suite. The annual revenues in that case will apparently reach $70 million. There are almost certainly more agents connected in the Salesforce deal to that data base than there will be HR personnel connected to the Wal-Mart application. On balance, complete CRM applications tends to sell for a higher price per seat than HCM solutions.I think it is reasonable to believe that the transaction will be worth $100-200 million over the life of the agreement, which might be for 5 or 7 years. No one is going to go through the onboarding expenses of a deal of this magnitude for less than 5 or 7 years - it is going to take a couple of years simply to roll out the solution and populate the data base with the information on 2.3 million associates, especially given the turnover that Wal-Mart experiences and the number of seasonal employees that are hired.Currently, the consensus forecast for Workday's revenues is in the range of $2 billion for the fiscal 2018 year. So, while a transaction that adds $30 million a year to revenues is significant, it is not significant enough to move the needle noticeably. And given the likelihood that the order will take a couple of years to deploy, the incremental revenues for fiscal 2018 are probably less than 1%. No wonder the company saw no need to update guidance.As mentioned above, the reaction of Workday to its Q3 earnings release was unpleasant, to say the least. The issue was pretty straightforward. Subscription bookings grew by ""only"" 37% to $380 million. Overall, the company had forecast that derived billings would be $445 million. Derived billings for Q3 turned out to be $454 million. Part of the problem, which confused some at the time, is the way the company calculates bookings. Not to re-litigate the argument, but the relatively weaker billings performance had much to do with shorter average contract durations that reduced the tabulated contract value rather than any diminution in the contract value of annual revenue growth. We have no idea just how the WMT contract is going to effect the derived bookings metric. And frankly, it doesn't matter for the business; it will, of course, matter for share value.It may seem strange to write this, but as a result of that beat, Workday raised its total derived billings estimate to $1.89 billion, or 32% growth for the full fiscal year. The derived billings estimate for this current quarter was essentially unchanged. But the overall change between expectations on the Q2 call, and expectations on the Q3 call, were minute - the change amounted to the $10 million by which Q3 bookings over-attained.Overall, the forecast for subscription billings growth falling to the mid-20% range for fiscal 2018 was very disappointing to some observers who lowered their ratings in the shares. Does the Wal-Mart deal, and the other deals talked about in the Blair note change that expectation? Here is an answer from company CFO Robynne Sisco that is eerily prescient given the state of play back in December: ""No, we have not modified our current view of next year (based on) for these slipped deals that we saw in November. And again, its early days in Q4 and how we deliver in Q4 will have a significant impact on next year. So, we'll have better information for you on FY 2018 at next quarter's call."" My takeaway from that, knowing what we know now, is that the Wal-Mart deal was anticipated, it wound up coming in a few weeks later than expected and its impact had been considered in the bookings forecast for the fiscal year that ends in a couple of weeks, and it will not have any impact on expectations beyond that.During the conference call in December, the CEO and the CFO alluded to a couple of significant slipped deals that were expected to close this quarter. In fact, the CEO talked about a couple of larger deals that had been expected to close before the conference call slipping to a later point. I think it is very reasonable to imagine that the deals alluded to by the Blair analyst, including this one (Wal-Mart), are those deals. I imagine the relatively robust derived bookings estimate given in December, which called for subscription bookings to accelerate to $630-635 million, actually included some allowance for this deal and some of the others that the Blair analyst alluded to in his note.Will the company's success at Wal-Mart increase the derived bookings growth beyond the forecast? I do not think we can be sure, although I do imagine that is now the expectation. One of the issues in that regard is going to be the specific contract terms. It is more than conceivable to me that the value of the contract that can be recognized and put into deferred revenues is somewhere below $100 million, even though the final sum of the revenues that Workday will realize could be greater than $200 million. We don't know the duration of the signed contract, and this company doesn't report a metric such as annual recurring revenues. Under the circumstances, will it matter a great deal to the share value if Workday reports $635 million or $700 million as the value of its derived bookings metric? It probably will in the short term, but it is going to be overwhelmed by other factors when this company reports its year end and puts forth a more specific forecast for fiscal 2018.How did Workday do it?I think it has been accepted by most observers that this was a competitive takeaway from the long-standing incumbent, SAP. How did it happen? We are really never likely to know all of the details. I am bound to think that pricing may have been part of the formula, although that will be stoutly denied by all concerned. Wal-Mart is known to be an aggressive IT buyer. Whether that works out for it in the long run is hard to know. But the company has always been an innovative user in the IT space and has always looked for concessions that are beyond what most normal large buyers seek to obtain. The flip side of that is Wal-Mart rarely has what might be called warm and fuzzy vendor relationships, and perhaps this was part of what did in SAP.At this juncture, I am not inclined to think that Workday has vast functional advantages in the HCM space, although it apparently continues to have a certain cachet as the most advanced HCM solution, particularly when it comes to talent management. The company is rated as the leader by Gartner, but its advantage in technology is not huge, according to the MQ report. Readers should note that the competition in the HCM space is really between WDAY and two other cloud-based best-of-breed vendors, SuccessFactors and Taleo, that were swallowed up by SAP and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) respectively earlier in this decade.About a year ago, an article appeared in an online publication called Diginomica. The article detailed why Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) chose Workday to replace SAP HR. It was a significant competitive displacement, although not on the scale of the WMT win. But it is, I believe, a template that probably explains much about WDAY's success in displacing SAP as an incumbent at Wal-Mart.It would appear that Sanofi was more focused on talent management than what is considered to be core HR functionality, and was willing to take some chances to ensure it had what were considered the latest and greatest bits of talent management functionality. For SAP, a sales situation with that set of priorities will inevitably present problems At this point, SAP has its core HR technology embedded in S4/HANA, while its talent management solution is part of its SuccessFactors offering. The two are not yet integrated.The issue is that while SAP has a good HR solution and SuccessFactors has a leading talent management solution, users report that integration between the two applications is flawed, uneven or hard to use. (By the way, the same observations hold true for Oracle/Taleo as well.) And so, it seems logical that companies like Sanofi and Wal-Mart, looking for a broad integrated solution and migrating to the cloud in any event, are open to migrating from one vendor to another, defying the well-known ""stickiness"" of major enterprise applications.The result at Sanofi also appears to have been the result of a very flawed series of miscues by SAP/SuccessFactors that, at the time, was still in the process of being integrated into SAP. Sanofi wanted to be told that users wouldn't be able to customize the solution. Workday provided a definitive answer and SuccessFactors did not. Did that happen at Wal-Mart. Unless someone at Wal-Mart says it did, outsiders will never know.Why was WDAY successful with WMT? I think the sales contest involved many of the same factors that led to the result seen at Sanofi. The SuccessFactors solutions are just now in the process of being integrated into S4/Hana. That is still a work in progress, and will be so for some time to come. Wal-Mart must have decided to move its application to the cloud in any event, which makes the decision to change vendor somewhat less of an issue than would otherwise be the case.I have no idea as to whether or not the sales effort from SAP was flawed. Those things happen. But until the SuccessFactors solution is tightly integrated into S/4 HANA, SAP would seem to have some vulnerabilities that Workday can, and will, exploit.The meat of the coconutI suppose I betray my age in using that phrase. Apparently, the phrase has gone out of fashion, and now the meat of the coconut is defined as... well, the meat of the coconut. According to what I read searching on Google, the meat of the coconut is a superfood with many healthy properties - I guess I lived enough years in the south to say that I am particularly fond of coconut cake, which I can't imagine is all that healthy.But back in my childhood, the meat of the coconut meant the substance of a thing and determining what was the important element in an idea. Simply put, the meat of the coconut for investors is determining the longer-term growth trajectory of WDAY. The growth rate of 27% that is the consensus forecast for WDAY's fiscal 2018 is probably inadequate to support even current valuations. The 30% number that the CEO said was comfortable is a little closer, and most likely the company has to grow faster still if its shares are to achieve positive alpha.At the end of the day, this analysis is only useful in trying to figure out if the large win at Wal-Mart means owning WDAY shares will provide a positive performance to portfolios. I don't care, particularly if Workday wins or loses a particular order, large though it may be, unless it means that I need to rethink the company's growth perspective over the next two or three years. I just don't think this order provides substantiation for that conclusion. There would be other transactions that would be more significant to me and would mean more for the future of this company.The current average rating from the consensus of 39 analysts posting their recommendation on first call is 2.6, squarely between Buy and Hold. And the average price target is only $82. The problem is that it is very difficult to maintain that the consensus forecast for sales and earnings is valid and still find some rationale for recommending the shares and for producing a price target above current levels. There is a basic inconsistency that requires analysts to suggest that management forecasts are sandbagging likely future results.The consensus growth forecast for next year is less than 28%, and the high forecast for the period amongst 39 analysts would be just 30%.The only way to make sense of the valuation is to believe that the growth rate for the company can maintain itself at or above 30%. In the last conference call, the CEO spoke to his comfort with that kind of expectation, i.e., 30% growth for some years to come. He also said the company would be able to achieve that kind of growth without a huge contribution from its suite of financial apps. Many people find that difficult to accept as a forecast. There are market analysis forecasts that suggest HR apps are showing just a 2% CAGR over the next 5 years. Some of that is the old devil of definition. Other forecasts have different functional definitions with higher growth rates ranging from 10-15% through 2022.That makes it very hard to accept that WDAY can achieve a 30% growth rate through the foreseeable future without a major contribution from its financial apps. Closing in on $2 billion of revenue, most of which is coming from HR apps, the company would have to achieve stunning market share growth over the next few years to achieve 30% growth overall without material contribution from other parts of its business and particularly due to its de-emphasizing of services revenues.That's really the conundrum, and the large WMT order and other large HR orders do not solve it. As mentioned earlier, if a large enterprise is moving HR to the cloud, it opens up a significant opportunity for WDAY. Neither Oracle or SAP have really integrated their advanced and rewritten cloud-based ERP with their externally derived talent management functionality. That lack of integration can pose problems for some users. If a user is going to the trouble of moving to the cloud, why go to further trouble of using a solution that apparently comes in mis-connected parts? I buy that. I buy that WDAY will grow significantly more rapidly than the market for HCM solutions as a whole for several years to come.But numbers are important. If the market is growing at a 10% CAGR, and that seems the most likely set of expectations, then how fast does WDAY have to grow in HR if it wants to grow at 30% overall? The only way to answer that question is by taking a guess at how fast financials are going to grow. And management is not adding much visibility in making that call, although the CEO suggested that adding visibility into financials might be a feature of the Q4 earnings call.Management says it sees no immediate sign of ""breakout growth"" in financial apps, although CEO Aneel Bhusri said he wouldn't be surprised to see it happen. From my perspective, it simply has to happen to make investing in WDAY worthwhile.Is there any real way to handicap the odds of success? Is there some special sauce that make WDAY financials more functional than the competition? Search as I did, there really is nothing in terms of functionality to distinguish what Workday has to what users can buy from Oracle or SAP. There will be opportunities for WDAY to enter the competition on a more level playing field when a user chooses to migrate financial apps to the cloud. There will be opportunities for the company to leverage its HCM installed base as those users move to the cloud. It has won some decent deals of note in financial apps, including from Panera (NASDAQ:PNRA), Denny's (NASDAQ:DENN) and a large unnamed financial management enterprise. But I think it would have been far more comforting to see WDAY secure a large order based on its financial application solutions - that might have provided the ammunition needed to suggest the company could really grow at a 30% rate for some years to come. WDAY says it has an advantage in terms of implementation costs for its cloud financials when compared to its larger competitors. That is hard to validate.On the other hand, WDAY Planning, a relatively new product, has seen a fair amount of market success in that it is more fully featured in the cloud than competitors. It is a way of sneaking into the world of pure financial apps. It is really hard to innovate an accounts payable module - software just doesn't facilitate going out and grabbing the checkbook of a customer - OK, that is not the funniest or most apposite of phrases. On the other hand, planning is a complex and ill-defined field, and WDAY has been able to show advantages and has built solid momentum in that space and expects to have hundreds of live customers early in its new fiscal year. I would like to recommend WDAY shares. But even going by the more optimistic expectations with which Mr. Bhusri expressed confidence, I just can't quite get there. I think investors will need to find a better entry point into this name if they expect to see positive alpha.ValuationNo, Workday shares aren't cheap, and unfortunately for prospective investors, they just got more expensive. As of Friday, the company's market cap was just shy of $16 billion. Net cash on the balance sheet was about $1.5 billion, so the enterprise value is currently $14.5 billion. The EV/S ratio, using the consensus for the 2018 fiscal year, is a bit greater than 7X. That really is a bit high for a company with 27% growth that has gradually seen falling percentage growth rates. No one is buying WDAY shares because of its non-GAAP earnings - certainly not yet. The P/E on non-GAAP earnings is astronomical, and GAAP earnings will not exist, according to the CFO, until the company's growth subsides significantly.In fiscal Q3, there were few signs of significant expense management of GAAP expenses. Overall, the GAAP operating loss widened noticeably and operating expenses rose 43%, faster than revenue growth of 34% or even subscription revenue growth of 38%.Workday does generate a fair amount of cash, and its cash flow generation has risen significantly. But again, using very optimistic assumptions, it would be hard to imagine that the company could produce a free cash flow yield of much above 3% next year - and even that figure is a stretch.Workday is an admirable company that is gaining market share and growing at prodigious rates that are likely to continue. But the rates are not quite prodigious enough for me to believe they will support valuations necessary to produce substantial positive alpha going forward. I am looking for a more optimal entry point before I commit my funds to this name at this point."
4008823,48501,2016-09-27T20:48:36-04:00,"30+% sales growth is forecasted for FY17.Leadership could do a better job with expense discipline and capital allocation.The share price is getting a bit ahead of the reality, but I'm bullish on the future of the company.","Workday Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY) is a cloud-based human capital management [HCM] software solutions provider. The company also offers application solutions for financial management [FM] and is rolling out Workday Planning, a planning, budgeting and forecasting application.Workday's HCM is increasingly being implemented by large enterprises with IBM (NYSE:IBM), Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK), and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) (OTC:SSNNF) highlighting Q2 client acquisitions. While Workday faces competition, including larger rivals SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), in the cloud HCM suites mid and large enterprise markets, I expect Workday to continue winning market share partly because of its well-above average customer satisfaction rating. A significant negative, HCM has a high upfront switching cost.Since Q4 FY16, there has been an improvement in mid-market enterprise purchases of Workday as a platform while large enterprises have been slower to adopt Workday as a platform partly because FM doesn't have the necessary capabilities to support a large enterprise's financial management requirement. Almost one-third of Q2's transactions included FM.During the first half of the FY, international sales growth (47%) outpaced domestic sales growth (32%). In the EMEA region, the notable second quarter HCM wins are Kering and Repsol. Samsung is the notable win in the APJ region, and Air New Zealand and Qantas are the notable wins from the ANZ region.Workday is expected to grow at a plus-industry growth rate of 35% reaching sales of $1.57B during FY17 versus the street's consensus of $1.56B. Cloud-based HCM software sales are estimated to grow from 37% of overall HCM software spend in 2015 to 40% by the end of 2016, according to Gartner. With Workday being the leader of an industry segment that is growing faster than the overall industry, the sales forecast implies that Workday continues to capture market share. Based on trend growth rates, sales growth slows to 24% in FY18 when sales reach $1.94B versus the street's consensus of $2.04B. At 31% sales growth y/y, the street's estimate isn't pricing in slowing growth. Consequently, a slowing of the growth rate into the mid-20% range should create an excellent buying opportunity.The key risk is that the growth rate slows to below the market's expectations as churn within the HCM software market declines. The HCM software market is estimated to grow at 7.4% in 2016 with Workday's subscription revenue expected to grow at 39%. In 2015, HCM grew by 4.4% while Workday's subscription sales grew by 52%. Fewer-than-expected enterprises switching from competitors would have an adverse impact on the growth rate and consequently the share price, given the market's expectations.The valuation of 9.5x FY18 sales is reflective of the growth rate and the company's ability to gain market share, but the 83% premium to the industry means that there is too much downside risk, in my opinion. The view is to accumulate shares at 8x FY18 sales or $75.28 per share.Unprofitable Growth with Cash Balance BuildingWorkday is expected to post 35% sales growth in FY17 with subscription services growing at 39% and professional services growing at 18%; sales will be reinvested into operations for the foreseeable future, resulting in a residual loss. The cash flow from operations is enough to cover capital expenditure and cash is beginning to pile up on the balance sheet.Data courtesy of Morningstar and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingSales are expected to top $1.5B in FY16 with operating expenditure of 90% of sales; while operating expense relative to sales has been trending lower, leadership could do a better job on the expense discipline front, bringing the company to breakeven faster. The net loss for the year is forecasted to come in at $360M with EPS of -$1.82.The pace of sales growth is expected to continue to slow in FY18; sales growth of 24% leads to revenue of almost $2B. Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is expected to reach $10B of sales next FY. FY18 is s turning point when the net loss starts to shrink, $355M from $360M. EPS is anticipated to be $1.72.Data courtesy of Morningstar and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingOn the cash flows front, leadership is following an organic growth strategy; in my opinion, that's a mistake and they should look to use more capital on strategic acquisitions. Additionally, WDAY could use some of the cash flow from operations to repurchase shares, decreasing the amount of shareholder dilution that is currently occurring.Data courtesy of Morningstar and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingThere is $2B of cash sitting on the balance sheet while shareholders are being diluted and sales growth is slowing. Given the relatively large re-occurring revenue base, it makes sense to start deploying some of this capital rather than having it sit in the bank not earning much of a return. Simply stated, leadership could do a better job on the expense discipline front and use that capital to make larger acquisitions and buyback shares.Primary Bear Market and Pricey SharesWDAY is in a primary degree bear market with shares rallying off of the low formed in early '16. This is an intermediate-term bull market and I'd use an intermediate-term correction to accumulate shares.Data courtesy of Morningstar, Bloomberg, and forecast courtesy of Bottom Up InvestingThe profitability-based valuations aren't meaningful as the company doesn't report profits on even an EBITDA basis. The F P/S is a bit high relative to the industry and I'd use a 15-20% decline in the share price to accumulate shares at a better valuation."
4027456,102421,2016-12-01T00:35:49-05:00,"Workday is a potential acquisition target by Microsoft.
        Workday Management is solid, but the firm needs help developing the financial space.
        Balance sheet is solid and cash flow burn is reasonable for a growth company.","The SaaS space is a crowded one, and the story is DOA for 2017. The cycle has started to top, with M&A activity setting a record in October 2016 as the latest sign that companies are struggling to achieve organic growth ( Zero Hedge). At this point, the large players like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have made large acquisitions while Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) was left at the altar.In today's global economy, Big Data and SaaS has to be a part of a large organization, and it appears that Workday will focus its attention on the public sector where they will focus their attention. The push into government entities and collegiate space is a red flag for a growth company. It indicates they are struggling to sell to the larger and more lucrative private sector. In fact, a review of the Workday press release web page shows most new clients so far in 2016 have been non-profits and colleges. Those accounts are amongst the most complex and least lucrative. I think Workday will soon exhaust their opportunities in this space, and it is only going to get more competitive for the next marginal customer.Don't wait for the stock price to go lower! It does not have to for it to get acquired by a competitor. The balance sheet has held up well, with $400M in cash and barely a cash flow burn ( Fiscal 2017 Second Quarter Financial Results). They won't soon need more money. They had a successful IPO in 2012, a $600M note offering in June 2013 and a $600M secondary in January 2014 (JMP Website). Cash is not the problem for Workday, but rather a stall in how much further current management can take the firm. Clearly from the latest Workday Rising event, some competitor out there has very little respect for them. Sadly, they need an Angel, and now would be a great time.They have a nice product, especially in the HR space. Let's face it, the firm was founded by HR pioneers David Duffield and Aneel Busri in 2007 as their swan song after PeopleSoft was taken over by Oracle. I think they fit squarely as a Microsoft Subsidiary. This presser shows the strategic partnership that was formed during this quarter. In fact, after the LinkedIn acquisition, and the fact that Microsoft does not have a true financial accounting offering, I think the next big deal will be here.Workday Management will realize they do not have a good chance in the financial space on their own. For reasons best stated by Seeking Alpha author Mark Gomes titled "" Is This Workday Nearing An End?"" gaining new accounting clients is a challenging because of barriers to switching.At the end of the day, there may be a surprise in the earnings tomorrow due to a lack of adoption in the financial software, but this is not a company to short. The next big catalyst will be a merger with Microsoft. It is not the time to short anything, not even tech, because while the valuation is high for a firm without a profit, Workday is a takeover target, and takeovers have huge upside potential."

But that appears to be changing now.","According to a Gartner report published earlier this year, global cloud application services, including SaaS offerings, are expected to grow 20% this year to $37.7 billion. The market was estimated to have grown 16% in 2015 to $31.4 billion. Gartner attributes this growth to the shift in the models of software vendors who are transitioning from on-premises licensed software to public cloud-based offerings. SaaS-based enterprise application services provider Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is already seeing the benefits of this growth.Workday's FinancialsWorkday's first quarter revenues grew 38% over the year to $345.4 million, driven by 9% growth in subscription revenues. The market was looking for revenues of $339 million. Excluding costs, Workday's EPS came in at $0.05 compared with the Street's forecast of a loss of $0.02 per share.By segment, subscription revenues grew 39% to $280 million and professional services revenues grew 31% to $65.4 million.For the current quarter, Workday projected revenues of $371 million-$373 million, marginally ahead of the Street's forecast of $371 million. For the year 2017, Workday projected derived billings to grow to $1.87 billion-$1.885 billion, compared with the earlier forecast for full-year derived billings of $1.855 billion-$1.875 billion.Workday's ExpansionWorkday continued to expand its geographical footprint by offering regional releases. During the quarter, it announced the general availability of Workday Payroll for France. Workday Payroll has already been released for the US, Canada and the UK. The Payroll platform for France will include support for France-specific requirements. It will cater to the regional legislative requirements such as regional tax updates.It will include the newly-initiated Déclaration Sociale Nominative (DSN) process that will simplify the process for organizations to replace a wide range of reports with a single statement. The application also supports the Single Euro Payments Area payment-integration initiative that is specific to the European Union. To cater to the growing European market, Workday recently opened a new office in Madrid.Additionally, Workday is looking to expand its market share by targeting medium-sized organizations. Going forward, it will focus on selling and servicing these companies through the development of lower-cost technologies that they are building for the particular segment. Some of the products targeted for this segment include Workday Planning, Workday Learning and Workday Student.Workday's Growing LossesDespite the increasing revenue, Workday hasn't seen much improvement in its bottom line. For the current quarter, operating expenses increased 38% to $419.1 million. Sales and marketing expenses climbed 34% to $127.5 million and R&D spend grew 43% to $141.8 million. Until now, the company was focused more on growth than on profitability. But that appears to be changing now. During the last quarter, Workday's senior management team defined their action plan on moving toward profitability. But it expects to turn profitable only ""over the next few years both from an operating margin and cash flow generation perspective.""Its stock is trading at $81.84 with a market capitalization of $16 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $85.67 in November last year. It has recovered from the 52-week low of $47.32 it had fallen to in February this year.Overall, Workday continues to be positioned well for growth in the coming months. SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) may be the market leaders in the ERP segment for now, but their biggest problem lies in adapting to the cloud. SAP is relying on HANA, which is really a database, to help it power its way to the cloud. While there's no denying that HANA has helped SAP over the past few years, it is still no substitute for a truly mobile and cloud-based experience like that offered by Workday.Similarly, Oracle (ORCL) is relying on Fusion, which is essentially a hybrid offering for cloud and on-premise ERP. As more organizations rethink their cloud strategy, Workday, which has been built on the cloud, will have an advantage. The challenge lies in the fact that it is not easy to get an organization to switch from an existing ERP system to an altogether new one."
4002075,52852,2016-08-25T11:08:02-04:00,Workday reported a very strong quarter and hosted a very bullish call.Sentiment has been negative with high and rising short interest.This quarter soundly defeated bears which should lead to a short squeeze.,"On August 24 after the close, Workday (NYSE:WDAY) reported a great Q2 and hosted a very bullish call - bears should be panicking. (Note: this article was written on August 24th after the close so the author does not have the benefit of hindsight.) The results should embolden bulls and drive a strong short-squeeze rally especially given the weak performance of hedge funds (thus weaker stomach for under performance) and the low volume summer lull. The company was trading at 7x FY2 consensus sales forecast prior to earnings and has the potential to exceed the 8x multiple it traded at the beginning of the year. Assuming a 5% increase to FY2 consensus sales and a 8x multiple, this implies a rally of ~20% from the August 24th closing price of $79.65.So what happened?Going into the quarter, the sentiment was very negative, and shorted shares went up ~40% since the beginning of the year. The short interest currently stands at 12%, 50% higher than the 8% average for the Information Technology Services peer group. Moreover, Wall Street - whose job is to promote stocks - is bearish on the stock with fewer ""Buy"" ratings than ""Hold"" and ""Sell"" ratings. The stock's uninspiring YTD performance, negative sentiment and building short interest kept potential buyers at bay. With the strong quarter, expected short covering and reversal of sentiment from negative to positive, the stock should out perform over the next quarter.I will not rehash the short case here - and there are different versions out there - so in the spirit of keeping it simple, I'll summarize the concern as fear of aggressive competition from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) which has manifested itself in decelerating new ACV growth and pricing pressure. Investors also are concerned with WDAY's relatively high multiple, which tends to aggressively contract when growth hits a wall - that didn't happen, certainly not this quarter.Q2 and guidance was not a blowout, but that is not the point. The point is that it was good enough relative to the negative sentiment. Q2 billings grew 38% vs. consensus of 34% and management guided FY17 billings to $445 million vs. consensus of $439 million. Importantly, this quarter demonstrated a reacceleration of new ACV growth driven by large HCM wins and large volume of midmarket financials, destroying the previously noted concern of deceleration.Even more importantly is management's bullish commentary on the call. A few key messages include:There are other bullish points as well, but I think you get the idea.In conclusion, if we think of quarters as boxing rounds, there is no doubt bears got knocked out - at least for the next three months. Key concerns around competition induced deceleration was put to rest so bears have little to hold on to. I predict this quarter will embolden side-lined bulls to initiate a position and will drive short covering, creating excess demand relative to a low volume period. The stock may appreciate in excess of 20% (relative to peers) until the bears and bulls meet again next quarter."

4028001,98236,2016-12-03T12:05:39-05:00,Workday reported the results of its fiscal Q3 (ended 10/31) yesterday evening.The results were a modest beat compared to expectations and the top-line growth was just enough to produce a modest measure of non-GAAP profitability.Management's guidance was a cut in expectations for the coming fiscal year from bookings growth of about 30% to 25%.The guidance cut reflects both shorter average terms length and perhaps a more measured pace of adoption of the company's financial apps.There is no indication that the company's sales machine is awry or that competitors are encroaching on the space. There is plenty of growth to come.,"Workday's kaleidoscope: The patterns are less pleasing.It is not uncommon to hear people referring to glasses half full or some equivalent locution. The poor phrase has become over-worked and needs some R&R. Occasionally I break down and use the phrase myself as a convenient shorthand. But if you were a person dying of thirst in the desert, the amount of water that Workday (NYSE:WDAY) was able to serve would just not get you to the next oasis. The company could have used a thimble for the amount of water that was presented to investors and still had space left over.I think before proceeding much further it would be well for me to state that I believe the current WDAY share price compression (17% this morning as I wrote this and 12.5% at the close) is one that can be used successfully to establish positions. Technically, I believe, the shares can reach what is called a break-away gap at the $65 range. The shares have lost 26% of their value since the high they set in October. They are now down 15% YTD. The decline in the share price is completely understandable and reflects what was said by management as to their shorter-term expectations. Guidance at the least is a stumble in terms of communications and at most represents a modest issue with the cadence of the acceptance of the company's financial applications suite. But there is nothing to suggest that it was more than that and the opportunities the company has and its ability to execute have not been altered by its current forecast.Almost all analysts covering this name will cut their price targets for what that means. I expect few, if any downgrades. (There has been one thus far by SoGen.) The company offers a compelling set of value propositions to its users, and regardless of what may be written, its share gains vs. Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) and against SAP (NYSE:SAP) remain on course. There is nothing that suggests its TAM has or will shrink or that it faces some new kind of competition or that users will decide to re-prioritize their software investments.It may be said that WDAY's valuation is still extended. That is a discussion I shall touch on later in this article. But extended or not (I will take not), its valuation is far lower than it has been, and perhaps as low as it has ever been since the company went public. Long-term investors should take advantage of that.WDAY is a bit complicated as a company. It has become a major factor in the space (HCM) in which it was founded and in which it has risen to become a dominant competitor, and then it offers users a different solution in an adjacent space (FinApps) in which it is a challenger with lots to prove. (In addition, it has made an acquisition (Platfora) through which it has acquired capabilities and products in a third space, analytics, but I will leave that one alone for the most part in this article.)A stormy environment for high-growth tech stocksI think before discussing WDAY and its quarter in some detail it is relevant to write a few words, at the least, in commenting on valuation and the tech wreck that garnered headlines yesterday but which in some stealth fashion has been going on since the election of Donald Trump. Unlike many, I do not offer opinions in public regarding Mr. Trump's persona. I hope he and his administration will indeed restore this country. Whether they have the right stuff and the means to do so is something that will be determined by a higher power in the future.But I believe I can offer some commentary about the impact, real or believed, that a Trump administration will mean for the economy or for specific classes of stocks. Since election day and through yesterday, the Dow (up by 10%) has strongly diverged from the IGV (down 3.5%) or the QQQ (down by 2%). That is a significant amount of divergence in less than four weeks and it represents a rather significant amount of sector rotation.Much has been and will be written about the reasons for the sector rotation. I think it is pretty simple actually. Investors believe that the policies of the incoming administration are pro-growth and perceive a substantial level of fiscal stimulus. I think, overall, that this is a tendentious assumption but it's one that has been made by many, both amongst the chattering classes and by investors.The impact of the fiscal stimulus, it is believed, will allow the Fed to raise rates and perhaps more importantly will lead to rising inflationary expectations. Those expectations, in turn, have already led to a significant up-trend in long-term rates. The relevant index (NYSEARCA:TLT) by a bit less than 9% since the election.The valuation models used by most analysts either in brokerages or in institutions to establish share price targets specifically look at a metric that is correlated to their discount rate assumption. The higher the discount rate, the lower the price target.The IGV, in particular, is meant to track a basket of names that is assumed by most to represent companies with significantly greater growth than the Dow or most of the other indexes that are typically tracked. As a result, the valuation for a given set of future earnings/free cash flow is highly dependent on interest rates and a 9% swing in interest rates in less than a month is going to induce a fair amount of price target resets and in turn a significant level of sector rotation.Commentators can say the same thing using more or fewer words, no doubt, but until long rates show signs of stability, the software/tech sector is more or less doomed to underperform other more broadly followed market indexes.While there are Trump policies that might have the potential to inspire an inflationary boom, I personally think the odds of their enactment in a form that would lead to such an outcome are not great. There likely will be a stimulus - oops, I mean infrastructure investment, but it will be in a form that does not bust the budget. Tax rates will decline, but the repatriation of corporate profits and the one-time impact of tax revenues from that source will constrain the budget impact of the tax code changes. But here I reach the realm of speculation regarding legislative enactments and thus I leave my comfort zone.There is a saying made popular by our 30th President, Calvin Coolidge, one of our more underrated leaders that says, ""if you see 10 troubles coming down the road, you can be sure that nine will run into the ditch before they reach you."" Worrying about sector rotation is a bit like that. It is important, it is happening, but over time it works itself out. I think it is overstating the case to think that the election of Donald Trump is likely to lead to an inflationary boom. Indeed, the latest employment report, with its very surprising decline in hourly earnings, might suggest to some observers that inflation isn't high enough.And I will now go back to commenting about Workday and its quarter recognizing that at the moment there is a material impediment to the valuation of many tech shares. Short-term investors can do with this synopsis what they will. In the longer term, it will not matter. It is another trouble, more likely than not, that will ultimately go in the ditch.Workday - of cabbages and kingsWorkday's reported quarter was a modest beat. It was just enough of a beat that it turned an expected non-GAAP loss into a small profit. For the record, revenues rose 34%, and in particular, subscription revenues were up by 38%. It is well to remember that the company has deliberately set a target of reducing the growth of its professional services revenues as part of a strategy to engage system integrator partners. As mentioned, the company had a minimal level of non-GAAP profitability. On a GAAP basis, product gross margins were up nominally at 84%. There is probably not much room for improvement left in that line. Professional services is more or less a pass-through business for WDAY, having minimal levels of gross margins. GAAP operating expenses grew substantially faster than product revenues-44% vs. 38%. This was offset by increases in depreciation and stock based comp which rose by 44%. The growth in operating cash flow (CFFO) was 36%. The growth in cash flow was constrained to an extent by the slow growth in deferred revenues. In turn, that is a function of the move by the company to offer a flexible variety of contract lengths. Current deferred revenues have increased by 17% year to date. The fourth quarter is normally the highest quarter for the growth in deferred revenue balances due to annual billings and payments.I think the view of most analysts is that the results of the quarter were ""solid."" I might call them unspectacular. The revenue beat was about 2% compared to the consensus but bookings were more or less consistent with prior expectations. The bookings expectation itself is getting muddied because of the shorter average terms of new bookings. Shorter terms for contracts in turn can lead to a smaller increase in deferred revenues.The CEO, perhaps in the cause of full transparency, chose to suggest that some large deals that had been expected to close in the first month of this current quarter had not done so. Will they close before the end of the quarter? Here is the precise commentary from Aneel Bhusri, CEO of Workday, during the course of the call: ""However, one recent development worth mentioning is slippage of some large deals early in Q4. Specifically, we have seen a few multinational prospects delay their projects. Some attribute the delay to global uncertainties such as Brexit, the U.S. presidential election and pending elections in other (EU) countries (Italy this Sunday, France next year). We suspect (hope) these are isolated events that will be short-lived but felt it was noteworthy enough to mention on this call."" I don't think I would call this the shot heard round the world. But it has been enough to cause a very substantial valuation compression in WDAY shares, and one that is not particularly likely to reverse in the next few weeks.And here is a follow-up during Q&A that is as much as management is going to discuss at this time: ""Okay, And then as a follow-up Aneel, I think we don't normally hear about deal slippage early in the quarter. I think commonly we hear about that at the end of a quarter. I think because presumably the deals could still be closed later in this quarter. So I'm just wondering are you conveying that it's (the quarter) going to be a little more back-end loaded quarter or do you see the potential for that slippage to (possibly) extend a bit beyond the end of Q4 here and into next year?""Here is Mr. Bhusri's answer: ""I would say that I hope it's a backend loaded quarter. We'll see how this uncertainty subsides and I would say we don't see any of that uncertainty in the midmarket-middle sized-medium sized companies are mostly U.S. based but people that are-entities that are global in particular in financial services, they have expressed that uncertainty and I think the dust will settle and we'll end up on a really good note in Q4. But we're conservative and when we see something happen in the marketplace, we feel like it's our duty to share that with investors.""Later on in the transcript, in an answer to a seemingly endless parade of questions on the subject, it became clear there were two slipped deals to which the CEO was referring. Mr. Bhusri said in answer to a question: ""I think in both cases, we're selected. So, it's not a competitive dynamic. It's much more of an uncertainty issue and this is coming directly from the CEO if those companies."" I guess I would not think it makes a great deal of sense to get terribly excited about two slipped deals that took place in the first month of a quarter. Deals come and go with lives of their own and these deals may or may not come back or be replaced with other deals.The problem with that last bit is that the company's specific guidance for the last quarter of fiscal 2017 subscription revenues and billings were reduced even though that reduction was by a negligible amount. And even worse, and certainly the likely cause of the magnitude of the share price debacle, the company has forecast lower growth in revenues and billings for fiscal 2018 than had been previously expected by both this writer and the consensus. I will say mea culpa here and now-I didn't see that coming at all and I am at a loss to explain it although I will take a crack at it below.Just to be clear, here is a quote from the prepared remarks by the company's CFO Robynne Sisco: ""While we're early in our fiscal 2018 planning cycle, we're currently modeling 30% subscription revenue growth next year, which takes into account our expectation of a continued headwind from flexible terms. We expect FY' 2018 subscription billings growth to be in the mid-20s.Due to the compounding effect of increasing seasonality and variability in the timing of recurring and renewal billings, we currently expect Q1 subscription billings growth rate in the low teens. We remain committed to measured incremental non-GAAP margin improvement in fiscal year 2018.""Again, the sting was in the tail here, with investors focusing on low-teens billings growth in Q1. I don't want to overwork the obvious, but if billings growth in Q1 turns out to be 13% (the low teens), then billings growth the balance of the year has to average 30% to get to a full year target of 25% billings growth. I think most observers and investors understand the issues of compounding and increasing seasonality, but I would be surprised if next several quarters really worked out quite the way forecast by the CFO. I think the use of models is a bit overdone when making that kind of forecast. I do not think the bookings level of Q1 2017 was quite that high that growth in that metric this spring will only be in the low teens.I obviously do not have access to a detailed model as to precisely how renewals are going to work for this company and how renewals will play against shorter initial terms. And the anecdotal checks I can make are not either specific or sizeable enough to really give me insight to compare against the guidance the company provides.It would be helpful if Workday provided numbers for the growth of annual recurring revenue which would normalize sales performance for the length of the initial contract. They do not do so at this point and it is likely to prove to be an error in communicating the health of the business to shareholders and other stakeholders.Analysts and I suppose this writer can often be accused of using information selectively. But if I accept that the commentary of management here is subject to negative interpretation, I also have to accept that the rest of their commentary is valid or do some kind of logical somersault and disregard Mr. Bhusri's commentary about the state of the market and the company's competitive positioning. So, I accept that the commentary of management has rightfully driven a share price compression but I also believe that Workday's business metrics are not likely to deteriorate.I would be inclined to believe that the slipped deals have done so in a random fashion and that they do not represent some profound pullback in either this company's competitive positioning or in the overall demand for financial apps. The first month of a fiscal quarter in the enterprise software world typically represents no more than 20% of total billings. I have no reason to believe that the company won't actually end up on ""a really good note for Q4."" The specifics of the Q4 billings forecast is actually very little changed from the prior consensus billings forecast and the forecast change has as much to do with FX headwinds as to any change in the business environment.So, just to encapsulate my view of the concerns, the one getting the most attention, the slipped deals from November, is really of little account and could well be reversed through the end of the quarter. The issue of low teen billings growth in Q1 of the soon to start fiscal 2018 is really one of timing and how billings are calculated for a SaaS company. But the issue to be considered has to be why full-year billings growth is now forecast at 25% rather than at 30% or some higher number. If it isn't competitive or demand, then what might it be. Surely not some extra-terrestrial anomaly.I do not have some clever, unique answer here. I think most observers understand that the CAGR for this company's HCM solutions will slowly decline as it has taken a lot of the low hanging fruit from the giants in the applications world, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP). HCM is simply not a fast-growing space and while the migration of HCM from on-prem to the cloud is significant the estimated CAGR is less than 10%, according to the latest surveys. While Oracle will try to bray about its competitive prowess in this space, the opposite remains the case, I believe, and if anything the recent acquisition of NetSuite by Oracle will put some additional accounts into play for WDAY. There is no reason to think that the Workday sales machine is foundering with regard to capturing an increasing share of available HCM deals. Workday remains where it has been in Gartner's ratings of HCM competitors, the leader of the pack. So, it all comes down to the adoption of the company's suite of financial apps which, in the nature of things, need to be competitive displacements. And while that is happening as the CEO suggested, perhaps the forecast reflects that it isn't happening quite fast enough.I am more inclined to take the CEO at his word. Again, I quote from the conference call transcript - for the last time, I promise. ""We're - I would say we're pleased with (the way that) Q3 shaped up from a booking perspective on financials. Maybe we'll give a year end look after the end of Q4. I think we expect financials to continue to perform well next year, but we're not looking for any step functions (of) increased (percentage) growth (in) financials.""Many readers are probably aware migrating from the financials of one vendor to those of another vendor is not a task lightly undertaken. Financial apps are a very large but very low growth set of applications. Essentially all of the sales in the space that Workday makes are competitive takeaways. No user in the history of time has ever gone out of his/her way to change financial apps. It is a very painful and somewhat fraught process that always winds up claiming extra resources. It is, I imagine, why the CEO doesn't want to forecast a step-function of increased growth.And yet, I believe based on parsing the reports of consultants and conversations I have with SIs that WDAY has what it takes to win in the sector. The CEO said he was delighted with sales of fin apps this past quarter and called out wins at Panera, Denny's and some large investment management company to be disclosed in the future.We do not get to see the growth in ARR for this company which is a shame. But I doubt that it is slowing meaningfully and I wouldn't be surprised to see it at or above 30% going forward. At the end of the day, the shares wound up losing 12.5% of their value today and price target drops will come all and sundry. And yet very few analysts will see the need to change their specific forecasts for revenues and earnings meaningfully and to the extent that they do so I think the new forecasts have a fair chance of being beaten.Workday shares have been felt by many analysts to be too highly valued before today and have had a rating of 2.5 on First Call, midway between buy and hold. I think that it is an excellent set-up for investors going forward.Valuation, consolidation and a final look at Workday's futureI make no secret that I think Workday shares weren't overvalued before and are more attractively valued at this point. No, it is not stubbornness and it certainly isn't a case of following the crowd as mentioned above. I simply believe, that to an extent not appreciated, Workday has a better mousetrap and is likely to continue to offer users a better experience and more bang for their bucks into the foreseeable future.The growth of this company is not magic. Yes, they (the founders) anticipated the cloud and jumped on that well before their rivals but the founders of this company have a well-deserved reputation for understanding the application software business. They are just better at it than their rivals. It is that part, I think, that frustrates the management of Oracle to the extent that they spend a fortune in print advertising knocking this company, and only this company, every Thursday on the front page of the Wall Sreet Journal.In terms of valuation metrics, the company, in the wake of today's share price implosion, has a market capitalization of $14.2 billion and has net cash of $1.4 billion. With an enterprise value of $12.8 billion, the EV/S based on 2018 estimates is a bit greater than 6X. I think the 6X might well be compared to Oracle's purchase of NetSuite which was growing more slowly at greater than 9X.This company doesn't plan to focus on profitability in its coming fiscal year - it has said on numerous occasions that it is focused on its growth opportunity and will chart a very gradual course to a 20%+ non-GAAP operating margin.As mentioned earlier, the company did enjoy positive non-GAAP margins this quarter but that should not be taken as a sign of change in its expense management strategy. Therefore, it is not feasible to value these shares on a P/E basis.The company's CFFO grew by almost 40% last quarter and at almost 50% for nine months. Overall, the growth in CFFO is forecast to track the growth in revenues this year according to the CFO although at the moment that seems conservative. The CFO has implied that the relationship between growth and CFFO is likely to persist into the following fiscal year. The company is in the process of building…a campus in its Pleasanton home-I was about to say monument but doubtless its investment is necessary. Other than the real estate investment, capex is forecast to be $150 million. So, the free cash flow forecast this year is about $200 million and the free cash flow forecast for next year is something in the realm of $300 million. That is a forward free cash flow yield of just over 2%.Investors buy these shares based on growth expectations and the overwhelming probability that ultimately profitability will reach to the 20%-plus non-GAAP operating margin target. That was true before this earnings release. It remains true.Recently there has been some significant chatter regarding the possibility of this company being consolidated. A SA contributor wrote an article to that effect published on this site. WDAY is of a size where that could make sense. The most common potential acquirer mentioned is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft is well known to want to bulk up its presence in apps and to challenge Oracle and SAP for dominance in that segment. While the company has spent liberally to improve its Dynamics offering, some say that Dynamics, outside of its CRM incarnation, doesn't have the heft and features available from WDAY. There are other potential acquirers - Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is certainly a possibility and while it would be well outside the box for IBM, this company and its team would truly change IBM's trajectory. Aneel Bhusri for next IBM CEO and Dave Duffield for the company's non-executive chairman. This hasn't been my most fun recommendation, but that doesn't mean investors should give up on the name. I look at it as a chance to add to positions and that is my plan at this point."
3979188,98236,2016-06-01T14:18:00-04:00,"WDAY's just reported quarter was one of beating estimates and raising projections.The company continues to gain market share against its two principal rivals - Oracle and SAP.Although the company beat EPS estimates this past quarter, that result was anomalous and will not be repeated during the balance of the fiscal year.Management is strongly focused on achieving some visible non-GAAP profitability in fiscal 2018.The shares have a short-term potential trade because of recent downgrades based on flawed information, coupled with a relatively high short interest ratio!","Is anything really the matter with Workday?Kansas is a small state in the middle of our country and it has contributed much to the history of our country. Indeed, its path to statehood, studded as it was with violence and indeed massacres such as those in Osawatomie and then Pottawatomie, gave rise to the slogan ""Bleeding Kansas.""There are loads of famous Kansans and loads of famous Kansas events. Our 33rd president, Dwight Eisenhower, grew up in Abilene, Kansas. The most important Supreme Court case of the 20th century is arguably Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, KS. I have always believed that the most important Kansan of all times to have been William Allen White, the longtime editor of the Emporia Gazette.What does that have to do with the earnings release of Workday (NYSE:WDAY) yesterday? In 1896, White wrote a hugely famous editorial entitled ""What's the matter with Kansas?"" Kansas was a difficult place to live in 1896 and was suffering a significant population drain. White was basically attacking what he believed to be the overly negative stories about his state and satirizing the ""we vs. they"" paradigm. Although the language grates on modern sensibilities, readers would be surprised about just how modern the arguments were back then. Things haven't changed all that much, at least in terms of political discourse since 1896 although the diction of the editorial will sound very odd to a modern reader.Workday and its muted share price reaction to its earnings and guidance is something like that. There is a French saying that synthesizes the debate, Plus ca Change, Plus C'est La meme chose - that is the more things change the more things stay the same. If you didn't like WDAY before, these results will not change your mind and if you are a WDAY holder, these results will not change your mind either. What's the matter with Workday? Nothing really for growth stock investors and quite a bit if you are looking for value.Some investors are going to appreciate the company's growth and market share gains, some will focus on the difference between some numbers and some attainment and some will deride the company's lack of profitability.Just to review some of the numbers at a high level, the company posted 38% in total revenues for the quarter to $345 million. Subscription revenue was up 39% to $280 million, a 39% increase. GAAP operating loss was $73.5 million, 21% of revenues compared to a $53 million GAAP loss, also 21% of revenue in the year earlier quarter. Non-GAAP profitability of 3% or $.05/share was said to be an unexpected outlier that will not be repeated in subsequent quarters.Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $161.5 million, a margin of 47% while free cash flow was $127 million or a margin of 37%. Operating cash flow grew by 75% and free cash flow grew by 98%. Overall, the company now has cash and equivalents of $1.6 billion of net cash or about $8.20/share. Deferred revenue increased by 42% over the last year.The company raised revenue guidance marginally, i.e. by less than 1% although to an extent that has to do with a change in the company's business strategy. At the mid-point, revenue expectations of $372 million for its fiscal Q2 that ends July 31, 2016, would represent about 32% growth in revenues, year on year. I'll discuss the change in emphasis in more detail below.Derived billings grew 37% year on year. That's probably below some expectations although it was slightly better than what were apparently consensus expectations. One of the issues that gets overlooked when comparing billings to expectations is large deals. The company had a dearth of large deals during the quarter after having loads of large deals in Q4. There is some randomness in that metric but more important, there is lots of seasonality. Large deals, depending on the specifics of their structure, are going to throw off lots of deferred revenue, which will be counted as part of derived billings. Smaller deals will not but that doesn't really mean much for their long-term revenue potential.The company is forecasting billings of $420 million in Q2, which would be 34% growth. If there is a greater proportion of larger deals in the mix which seems likely simply because of seasonality, that number will be most likely exceeded handily. The company is forecasting derived billings to reach between $1.87 billion and $1.88 billion. The exactitude of that number in a business like enterprise software has brought a chuckle to my face.But regardless, the growth percentage would be 31%-32%. Both of those numbers are being depressed by a switch in the company's emphasis on services, which are to be pushed to the ecosystem. Services growth is forecast to grow just 15%-17% and that will take a bite out of bookings and overall revenue growth through the balance of this fiscal year. The strategy, of course, is to incent the ecosystem to build a large implementation and consulting practice to support new Workday users and to provide some support for the company's sales effort.The CFO talked about the timing of revenue recognition as the company bills and cash moves from the balance sheet to the income statement. In any single quarter, the timing of such items can impact revenue growth by up to 5 percentage points, she said. With that in mind, the CFO has forecast revenue for the year to be about $1.55 billion, up 34% year on year.That number is congruent with current consensus analyst expectations but given the de-emphasis on services, represents a greater percentage growth in product revenues. Presumably, that is a good thing. The earnings forecast for the year of break-even will probably be considered to be in-line with current consensus forecast of a profit of $.02. I will forebear saying anything about the CFO's passionate defense of the need for stock-based comp. Indeed, the less said about that unfortunate part of the script, the better.The CFO forecast that the percentage growth in operating cash flow will decline from Q1 rates, which is likely as sales increase during the course of the year and receivable balances rise rather than fall as was the case this past quarter.There will, no doubt, be those who are disappointed with both the bookings attainment this quarter and the failure of the company to increase its revenue forecast for the full year. I think that such disappointment is misplaced. Services revenue has been about 19% of the total. The company is taking steps to slice the growth rate, which was 30% in Q1 to half of that number. Math would suggest that such a change is going to lower growth rate expectations by something like 9-10 percentage points for the balance of this year and will do the same to bookings metrics.Many companies in the IT space choose to deemphasize services and provide their partner ecosystem with a greater percentage of the available business. It is lots easier to use the ecosystem as a competitive tool when the company is throwing work at the ecosystem.So what is the path to profitability?I thought that one of the most interesting elements of the call was the discussion by CEO Aneel Bhusri regarding profitability. The man must surely have spent time reading about the lack of profitability and how that was discouraging investors. He actually discussed his predilections to see a more stable share price. I will let the man speak for himself:(The CEO here was referring to meaning Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) - I will let readers decide on whether those companies are exemplars of profitable growth.)There is the old saying about ""being careful of what you wish for."" The takeaway from Mr. Bhusri's comment is that the path to profitability has lots to do with the number of new products that are being developed and released vs. the number of old products - in this case HCM - that are already generating substantial amount of profit. The investors who own or should own WDAY shares are investors most looking for hyper growth to continue.I have written in the past about Salesforce and its need to enter new markets in order to grow as its old products ramp to middle age. Indeed, just this morning, CRM announced its acquisition of Demandware (NYSE:DWRE) and also announced a new cloud. Even Amazon (AWS) needs to announce new products almost continuously to drive growth. In that regard, see the company's new Aurora database.It is relatively easy for a company with strong growth to reach profitability. I know it sounds simplistic, but if WDAY wants to reach profitability, all it needs to do is to cut down on new hires. The result of what happens when new hiring lessens was visible in this past quarter. The company fell behind on its hiring plan. The result was an unanticipated profit in Q1, which was derived by relatively lower non-GAAP expenses.The current consensus forecast for WDAY based on 31 analyst estimates is for the company to achieve non-GAAP EPS next year of $.27 and to achieve 31% revenue growth. I think without the headwind of reducing the services contribution to sales by deliberately downsizing that operation, achieving 31% growth should be easy - well relatively easy. The company has 194.5 million shares outstanding. So, EPS of $.27 is equal to $52 million. We do not know what WDAY's real non-GAAP tax rate might be because they have never reported any significant profit.But for now, I will assume a 33% tax rate. The company has incurred about $5 million a quarter of other expense net, which is the difference between the interest it pays on the outstanding debt and the interest it receives from its cash balances. So, all in the company is going to need to achieve about $110 million of operating income to achieve $.27 of non-GAAP EPS. That would be an operating margin of 5% compared to break-even this year. I don't imagine that constraining OpEx expense growth to 25% will be a huge hardship. I imagine that it will happen the way observers and investors expect.GAAP profitability is a long way off. GAAP margins are running 25%-27% below reported non-GAAP margins. The company has a business model that it strives for over time of achieving operating margins above 20%. That isn't going to happen overnight and when it does, the company will probably just reach GAAP break-even. As I have written in the past, looking at free cash flow is a far better metric by which to gauge the company's progress than is reliance on GAAP profitability. That said, I think someone, at some point, needs to counsel CEO Bhusri and CFO Robynne Sisco that stock-based comp is a real expense and that making decisions on sales and development expenses while excluding 25% of the cost is not the wisest way to get things right.So why are WDAY shares reacting in a mediocre fashion to the earnings release?I won't deny that the shares are very highly valued and highly valued shares often need perfect quarters to move higher. The company's EV/S using the latest guidance and the Yahoo Finance market cap estimate is 8.6X. Even using consensus estimates for fiscal 2017 revenues, the EV/S calculates to be 6.5X. The P/E at this point is not meaningful. The company as mentioned earlier had a strong cash flow quarter with both operating cash flow and free cash flow rising by 80%-plus.Management more or less waffled on forecasting cash flow for the balance of the year except to say that it will increase consistent with the growth in bookings. Using that forecast and the forecast of $185 million for capex, free cash flow this year is likely to be around $275 million. That works out to a free cash flow yield of about 2%. Those are stretched valuations compared to much else out there.As a result, consensus ratings from the 35 brokers who report their recommendation to First Call is 2.4, essentially in the middle of the recommendation range. The mean price target is all of $77/share, just 2% higher than where the shares are trading at this moment. Over the past five weeks, there have been four downgrades and no upgrades.In that kind of environment, analysts are seeking to justify their ratings, especially those analysts who lowered their rating based on the expectation of either a miss or a guide down. The basic negative story today has been that the percentage revenue and EPS beat was the smallest since the company's IPO back in 2012.Once upon a time in the investing world ""whisper numbers"" were all the rage. Those numbers, have, to an extent, gone out of fashion these days. But apparently, analysts want to bring them back by saying a beat isn't a large enough beat. I actually do think that the Q1 bookings performance may have been less than planned although it is hard to say. In the year earlier quarter, the growth in deferred revenues also was quite weak, even weaker than this year and so the difference between derived bookings and revenues was small. Of course, at that point, the company was achieving 60% growth so no one looked too carefully.I believe that Q1s are inherently the most difficult quarters to forecast, or at least that was my own experience. The working set of opportunities is always smaller as salesmen of successful companies will drain the swamp. With relatively fewer large deals in a forecast, if a couple don't close in the quarter, the growth percentage looks ugly. As I wrote above, Workday built its quarter in the absence of any significant transactions and still achieved an upside. And it should be remembered that until now, this is a company that didn't even focus on smaller transactions.I think the cavils and nit-picking of the analysts who had recently downgraded the shares or who have cautious recommendations are just that - cavils and nitpicking. The company showed its normal level of financial discipline. By that, I mean it focused on investing more in growth than in trying to attain higher operating margins with the inevitable results to GAAP profitability.I mentioned above, that in essence, the company was slicing about 9% from total WDAY revenue expectations due to its move to allow its partners to do more services work. Deliberately reducing service revenues to a 15%-17% growth will have very visible impacts on both revenues and bookings, although the impact on earnings will be minimal since the gross margin on services was all of 9.3%.There was nothing wrong with either the quarterly print or the company guidance other than it dissatisfied some negative analysts. It was precisely the kind of quarter that ought to have been anticipated. The company continues to outperform its rivals significantly and it is getting ready to disrupt its market with further innovations over the balance of its fiscal year.What will it take to get WDAY shares moving again?Probably all that anyone needs to know. And I'm not going to call the 2% appreciation seen today much of an upside. To get the shares really moving, I think some large, high profile wins would be important. The absence of those deals hurt optics for last quarter significantly and gave observers little to chew on. In particular, I think some high profile wins within the company's financial offering would be helpful. Co-President Phil Wilmington said on the call that the pipeline was particularly strong in 2H-2017. It would be nice to see some of that strength trickle into Q2.There are those who still doubt WDAY's franchise position within its spaces. I'm somewhat surprised at that. WDAY clearly is the market leader in HCM solutions when compared to either Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) or SAP (NYSE:SAP). Those companies have and will continue to have significant functionality, reliability and installation problems. Again, I will let the CEO speak for himself on the subject. I have had to edit the transcript a bit to make it intelligible to readers:Without being tedious, the watchword for the commentary regarding competition was that WDAY was offering integrated solutions and their two principal competitors simply cannot because of both technical and financial considerations. Of course, that quote was from the CEO of the company and readers may not choose to believe his commentary. But the fact is that neither SAP nor Oracle were achieving 38% bookings growth last quarter and indeed SAP was shrinking. This company is not a price leader for sure. So one is left with the belief that WDAY does have better solutions in order to grow so much faster than its rivals.Better products and market share winning sales performance don't always translate into higher share values immediately. And given the valuation of this company, it is possible that the shares will be range bound the next quarter. There are rarely intra-quarter news events that move shares of a company that sells HCM and financial solutions. This is anything but Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which seemingly has headlines every day.HCM and Financial apps are not particularly exciting for many investors. There could be an upgrade or two. After four downgrades that had a modest but still visible impact on the relative performance of the shares (the shares are flat since the first downgrade on 4/25 vs. a 5% gain for the IGV index) and which proved to be based on false information, some brave soul may choose to upgrade the shares. In the absence of bad news, the shares should have a tendency to work higher in the appropriate market environmentSelf evident thought it may be, it will take a couple of beat and raise quarters coupled with renewed and more granular information about the company's path to profitability to really make this stock work better. In the very short term, the shares may work since it did beat numbers and actually raise its forecast. The short interest as of the end of April was 16.9 million shares and that is 15.4% of the current float. Without a negative catalyst in the offing, some of the short interest may go to greener pastures.WDAY shares have certainly been volatile but they haven't changed in price all that much since the end of 2013. The shares are surely a far better value now than they were then, the company is far larger and the company's competitive position is much better. I believe that we are now approaching the time at which beat and raise quarters will mean something significantly positive for share valuation.Wrapping it upWDAY reported the results for its fiscal Q1 last evening, May 31, 2016. The results were a beat and a raise, and perhaps more of a raise than is apparent based on the company's decision to throttle back the growth of its services operation in favor of its partner ecosystem. The company achieved a modest measure of non-GAAP profitability but that was more of an anomaly than a trend. Management intends to focus more on profitability in fiscal 2018. The company enjoyed substantial growth in terms of both operating cash flow and free cash flow.WDAY achieved its results in the absence of any large deals in the quarter. There are abundant large deals in the company's pipeline and some of them should start closing in the current quarter.The company continues to enjoy a substantial technology advantage when compared to its principal competitors - Oracle and SAP. The company continues to gain market share against its two rivals and is now most likely the largest vendor of HCM solutions.The shares while no bargain based on traditional valuation metrics do afford investors one of the growth-iest stories in the IT space. The set-up for short-term performance is better than might be expected with four recent downgrades based on information that proved to be incorrect, a dubious analyst community that is basically afraid of the share valuation and a relatively high short interest.Other than the potential shorter-term trade based on the factors mentioned above, I think the shares are at a reasonable entry point for longer-term investors."
4002488,98236,2016-08-26T19:31:00-04:00,"Workday reported its results the other day, and revenue and bookings growth exceeded expectations.The company continues to prioritize growth as opposed to profitability, and that is unlikely to change in the near future.Workday is gaining market share quarter after quarter when compared to its principal competitors, Oracle and SAP.WDAY's product initiatives appear to have reached a significant level of success with its planning module next up as a major growth driver.The company's shares are expensive and may put a cap on short-term share price appreciation. Going forward, the company has a path to profitability that is well posted.","Whose braggadocio do you like better?At the end of the day, it's a matter of personal preference I suppose. There are some commentators who do not think that a 42% increase in software subscription bookings achieved by Workday (NYSE:WDAY) this past quarter is not a blow out. But, for the most part, it would appear that Aneel Bhusri, Workday's CEO and co-founder, had some reason to ""strut his stuff"" as the saying goes. But he has a far different way of showing confidence and optimism than rival Larry Ellison of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). I won't make much of a secret that I find Mr. Bhusri by far the more credible of the two prominent leaders in the business - there are readers who will doubtless disagree.But, as I will discuss further in this article, Mr. Bhusri put what might be best termed as ""a world of hurt"" on the rationale and the prospects for Oracle's impending merger with NetSuite (NYSE:N). I usually take such pronouncements with a grain of salt - maybe two or three. But since Mr. Bhusri's assessment happens to jibe quite closely with the opinions I expressed on this site a few weeks ago, they must surely be correct. I think the current expression for that is (lol). Three colloquial expressions in the first two hundred words - ugh!I try to write articles about how to maximize alpha although I suppose I get drawn off course from time to time. But in terms of discussing the ability for WDAY to generate positive alpha, one of the principal issues is competitive positioning. Even after lots of growth over the past several years, for the most part, all of WDAY's large deals are competitive takeaways. There were a couple of large deals this quarter including a mega deal at IBM (NYSE:IBM) and a significant expansion at Dell/EMC (NYSE:EMC) that were not competitive takeaways although they were certainly competitive procurements. But, for the most part, when WDAY wins, it does so by displacing one of its two major competitors. One has to decide on winners and losers in the cloud transition of enterprise applications. Market shares will not remain consistent with the past, and there will be winners and losers. It is awfully difficult to envision a robust future for WDAY and its two major competitors simultaneously. Maybe two out of three might be possible. Three out of three would be logically just a stretch that I cannot make.The question in writing this article in the wake of 7% share price spike after the earnings release and the refutation of several recent negative calls is whether or not there is still positive alpha remaining. I wrote my initial article for SA on WDAY back in March when the shares were $73. Thus, the shares have appreciated by 18% in the past five-plus months since the publication of the article. On the other hand, the IGV is up 13% over the same period. Given WDAY's beta of 2.2 beta, that is really no positive alpha at all, so to speak. So, for me, the question more or less answers itself.If the shares were a good buy in March, then they are still a good buy on a relative basis. That being said, there are more than a few amber signals flashing with regard to the future performance of the economy, and specifically, the potential performance of mid-cap hyper growth names. If I were trying to trade the shares, I wouldn't think there are too much short-term upsides or any catalyst in particular at this point. The average price target before the earnings release was just $85. I'm sure that there have been a fair number of price target increases, but given the fact that there was no real increase in guidance, the price target increases will be small although one bank did raise their target price from $85 to $98/share. But, for the most part, I think the average price target will probably get to $90 or the low $90 range, and that really is likely to be a short-term upper bound to the shares - at least until the next earnings release. Without going through a painful exercise, it is my opinion based on consistent commentary by this management not just on this call, but on the one before that guidance should have been increased and increased by a noticeable level. I would be very surprised if revenue growth and bookings did not wind up exceeding the current forecast. But that is eating for November along with turkey and pumpkin pie; in the short term, Thursday's spike is likely to be what investors are going to get.But rather than attempt to discuss how to trade WDAY in which the comparative advantage of my thoughts is not likely to be dispositive, I will spend the balance of this article writing about why WDAY remains an equity with loads of positive runway in front of it for many years to come.There is a great tune from my youth called ""Young at Heart."" It has been sung at one time or the other by just every famous performer from Frank Sinatra to a group called ""The Cure."" I confess I have never heard the group perform, and from the little I have read of it, I have no urgent desire to hear how it might have performed this song.The lyrics of the song are as apt as summarization of the history of and the prospects for WDAY at this point. For those who have never heard the song or who may have forgotten its lyrics, I will reprise those that are germane to WDAY's past and future. The song starts by proclaiming ""Fairy tales can come true, it can happen to you if you're young at heart, for its hard you will find, to be narrow of mind if you're young at heart…And here is the best part, you have head start if you are among the very young at heart."" The rest of the song really seems on point as well as the lyrics talk about going to extremes with impossible schemes and that life gets more exciting with each passing day. Indeed it does if you work at Workday.Why do I bring this up in an article about Workday? It probably was more or less something like an impossible scheme to believe that anyone might take on Oracle and SAP (NYSE:SAP) and earn a major position in the center of their market from nothing in just the last decade. And somehow Workday has stolen a significant head start on its primary competitors really by being open to the new technologies that were just becoming available when this company was put together. The concept that it is hard to be narrow of mind if you're young at heart is basically the mantra for WDAY.I suppose there are readers who would prefer these articles if I simply stuck to the statistics, and there are plenty of outlets in the world of today where you can find that. But I think Seeking Alpha as a practice as opposed to the Website requires going a bit beyond just the raw statistics, and for me, using the lyrics from American standards works as well as anything else.There are certain ineluctable qualities that make companies in a hotly contested struggle winners. One of those is the attribute of being young at heart and embracing the future and the changes that the future brings in an appropriate spirit. And that is WDAY in a nutshell. And no, I avoid love affairs with companies; this one has and will have warts and issues and bumps in the road from time to time. Quarters do not come together neatly, and I'm sure that will be true for this name, although it seems less likely in the next couple of quarters.So with all that rhetoric, how did WDAY really do and what is the outlook?The headline numbers include total revenues of $379 million, up by 34% year on year, with GAAP operating losses of $87 million and non-GAAP operating profit of $6 million, a non-GAAP net loss per share of $.04. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $161 million and free cash flow was $127 million, based on the Workday definition.Guidance for Q3 includes revenues of just less than $400 million, which would be growth of about 31%. The company is forecasting full-year booking to grow to $1.88 billion with total revenues of just a bit greater than $1.55 billion, or 33% growth.The Platfora acquisition, which should close by the end of October, is expected to impact operating margins by 250 basis points and bring Q3 non-GAAP operating margins to a loss of between 2% and 3%. For the full year, and inclusive of the impact of Platfora, the company anticipates break-even non-GAAP operating margins.This is another tech company with a yen for real estate. It plans to spend $125 million for its new headquarters. I can't forbear quoting the Pleasanton newspaper ""that at the top of each floor, an approximately two-foot-tall portion of the glazing will have a frittered pattern of small silk-screen dots…will be visually interesting and the materials and colors both attractive and compatible with surrounding developments."" The rendering in the newspaper looks like the building will be a wide shoebox, but I suppose that in Pleasanton that passes for visual interest in an office complex.Free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure, and hence companies can do with it what they will. But taking the investment in real estate and removing it from capex in the non-GAAP free cash flow calculation is... well, I like the shares, but I certainly do not approve of the policy.Perhaps of more importance in the context of an analysis is that the company has improved the utilization of its infrastructure to the extent that it has been able to reduce its ongoing capex projection to $160 million. Overall, using WDAY's definitions, it anticipates strong growth in both operating cash flow and free cash flow for the balance of the year.So what really happened in Pleasanton this past quarter?Headline metrics can often be as deceiving as they are revealing. At the outset of this discussion, it is important to remember or note that Workday has adopted a deliberate strategy in which it is shifting more of its consulting work to partners and limiting the growth of its own services operation. Indeed, the company's expectation for professional services growth this quarter is only 7%. So, it is important to look at software bookings as a better indication of growth than the headlines.Software bookings rose 42% year on year during the quarter ended 7/31, which compares to a growth ""just"" 37% in that metric in the prior quarter. And it is equally important to note some of the following. In response to a question, Mr. Bhusri and Co-President Phil Wilmington ""signed-up"" to 3-5 years of 30% growth in HCM. Lots of joking around at that point, but if it were to happen that way, it would be materially greater than the numbers that are used for consensus forecasts. Note that next year's forecast for top-line growth is 31%, and the co-president is signing on to do 30% in just HCM.In response to another comment, company CFO Robynne Sisco said, ""That's exactly right. In fact, we saw that accelerated growth (in terms of ACV) in both Q1 and Q2 and we expect it for the full year as well."" If ACV growth is accelerating, it is easy to ""sign-up ""for elevated revenue growth expectations.There are probably several factors at work in the re-acceleration in bookings growth last quarter. One of these is simply the random nature of closing large deals. For example, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) became a customer of WDAY last quarter - a very large deal - whose timing would have been more or less impossible to forecast in advance.Another issue is competition. As time has gone on the difference in the results of installing WDAY HCM solutions compared to installing cloud solutions from its competitors has become more apparent and is part of the selling environment. That does not mean that all of Oracle's installed customers are jumping to WDAY. It does mean that when these customers migrate to the cloud, or when they reorganize HR processes that need to be tracked and analyzed, they give WDAY a look and do not simply migrate within the Oracle (or the SAP) family.The opposite side of that has been the add-on wins. The easiest way to sell products for software companies is to get existing customers to buy more of what they have installed. And so the wins at IBM, which by the way actually owns a company, Kenexa, that sells web-based HCM solutions, and at Dell/EMC, are so significant. IBM of course stills sells Kenexa, but it also bought a company called Meteorix to help its customer base install WDAY. Logically, at some point, IBM will decide in the fullness of time that it will displace its current vendor of fin apps and start deploying WDAY. It seems apparent that IBM just like the results it gets from WDAY better than the results of its own products and competitive offerings.Many years ago, when Workday was really a tiny company, Oracle started bashing it, almost as though it was an opposing political candidate. I wondered why was Oracle bothering at that point; WDAY was so small, how could it be a threat to Oracle? The answer a few years on is obvious; WDAY has probably had a greater impact on Oracle than any other company since the rise of Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and if its starts to break through in financials, the damage it can do to Oracle's financial performance will not be insignificant. WDAY says that the breakthrough will be visible in the next two quarters. It will be interesting to hear Oracle on the subject when it reports the results of this current quarter in a few weeks. If I use the metaphors of war; well, this is a war and probably a far more bitter war than war-like conditions that exist in soft drinks or in disposable diaper markets.I think the other explanation for WDAY's growth recrudescence relates to its broadening product footprint. For example, WDAY is in the process of introducing a planning product that can be used with both its fin apps and its HCM suites. There are only 50 planning product installations at the moment, so the revenue contribution from the product itself is trivial. But what is likely to be noticeable is the drag that planning has in the sense that some buyers would not have bought from WDAY without the planning capability. Although most apps have APIs so that they can be integrated, it is far more convenient and efficient to integrate planning with the other processes that are part of every company's working procedures. Wilmington indicated that one-third of WDAY's transactions last quarter included financials. For WDAY, having a multi-product footprint raises ASPs and promotes healthy drag-along. Here are some comments from Wilmington that illuminate the contention:Before leaving the section on what is really happening at Workday, I'm going to quote and synthesize what I thought were the more trenchant comments of Mr. Bhusri. Readers do not have to agree on the subjects covered. But Mr. Bhusri is well respected in the industry and is respected such that on the regular ads in Thursday's WSJ bashing WDAY, he is actually quoted as saying that Oracle has its act together better than SAP.But there are many investors and commentators who feel certain ways about Oracle, and it is probably useful to hear the other side of the story from someone who worked there, was a founder of PeopleSoft and is as well connected in the enterprise software space as it is possible to be. And, of course, the commentary is not uninstructive in evaluating WDAY's share price outlook either.Here are some of Mr. Bhusri's words on the subject starting with the partnership between NetSuite and Ultimate Software (NASDAQ:ULTI): The quote that follows from Mr. Bhusri is significantly edited in the interest of length. But, to put it in context, this was in response to a query about how the competitive environment will change with the acquisition of NetSuite by Oracle.I really do not think that these poor fingers might type anything more about the subject than those quotes. Workday has gained share, is gaining share and is likely to continue to gain share, and that is the most illuminating part of the Q2 earnings release.But it doesn't earn money - is it ever going to earn money?Observers have been questioning whether the company will ever be able to reach anything like its business model, which calls for 20% operating margins. So far, the path to profitability has mostly been notable for its absence or its sustainability. CFO Sisco talked about the issue several times both in her script and in response to questions. She said that while 20% operating margins remained the company's working model, at the moment, the focus was far more on growth than on profitability. For a company that derives its revenues from leases that tend to produce revenue for a decade or more, the trade-off in financial terms of spending now to get renewal revenues later makes all the sense in the world, but it may not appeal to readers who are risk adverse and want to see traditional profit numbers.Last quarter, during the call, Mr. Bhusri, as part of the script, talked about the company's path to profitability. I wrote an article about that point at the time, so I will not reprise it, and I will spare the readers the words in his quotation. Against the backdrop of a 42% increase in license bookings and a 42% increase in the deferred revenue balance, here below are some of the expense metrics in WDAY's fiscal Q1. As I have written in past articles, these are GAAP; I don't think converting a GAAP cost to stock-based comp makes for a particularly relevant comparison.Product development costs rose 40%, sales and marketing costs rose 31%, and general and administrative expense rose by 25%. Product gross margins contracted from 84% to 83%, and services gross margins grew from 3% to 7%. Overall, GAAP operating margins were a loss of 23% compared to a loss of 24% the prior year. Stock-based compensation rose by 36% year on year. The non-GAAP operating loss was 1.6% of revenues compared to break even operating margins last year.Overall, what sticks out in the expense numbers is the extraordinary spend on product development. At 41% of revenues, it is one of the highest such ratios that I have ever seen. It is unusual to see product development spending top spending for sales and marketing in an enterprise software company. Many other software vendors have a development spend expense ratio of half of what this company spends. So, I think it is safe to say that the path to profitability is going to be built when the company is not quite so young at heart and decides to focus less on building new products. For now, the company has a strategy of extremely high development spend to rapidly introduce new products into the market which are levers that have helped it to beat its competitors and expand its market share rapidly.For me, the issue is if the spending on product development is producing the results it is designed to produce. I think it is relatively clear that at this point it is. It is not going to be a business strategy that appeals to all investors. There will be some who will suggest that WDAY's valuation is too lofty for the results being generated.Workday does have a lofty valuation. Its current enterprise value is a bit over $14 billion. The revenue guidance for the full fiscal year is about $1.5 billion. So that is an EV/S of 9.5. There will be no earnings and hence no P/E to calculate. Overall, the company has indicated that it will be able to increase cash flow and its definition of free cash flow at the same rate or greater than the rate of revenue expansion. That forecast would yield operating cash flow of over $440 million or a cash flow margin of 29.5% at a minimum. On the same basis, free cash flow would reach about a bit over $250 million, which would result in a free cash flow yield of 1.7%, again at a minimum.So, the question is whether the valuation might compress or whether the company will keep expanding at a rate that will justify the share valuation. There is no one single answer to that, and I would not wish to suggest that there is. But again, this company has a very clearly thought through and articulated strategy, and it has and is likely to continue to deliver on the objectives of growth and market share gains and in developing a significant moat in terms of the functionality it has and will offer in the future when compared to its principal competitors.I can't tell how the shares are going to trade in the coming weeks as I suggested at the start of this article. I do believe that over the course of a year or two, the shares will produce significant positive alpha for investors.Recapitulating Q1 results, the outlook and the investment caseCan Workday's shares break out and advance to a new level over the next few weeks? Hard for me to know that. Will the company outgrow its rivals and be able to achieve the kind of financial metrics that will please shareholders? I believe that to be the case. And we will just have to see the extent to which Mr. Bhusri proves to be a prophet regarding the Oracle/NetSuite merger."
3960035,98236,2016-03-21T18:42:27-04:00,"Workday appears to be the competitor that Oracle fears and hates the most.Workday has reported a spectacular quarter to end a strong fiscal year at the end of February.While most investors know that Workday is not GAAP profitable and is unlikely to be so in the future, they may not realize how much cash the company already generates.Last quarter, Workday displaced Oracle and/or SAP at some high profile companies such as Airbus and Marsh & McLennan.Workday has just gotten its first large financial applications customer, J.B. Hunt, into production. The financial applications market is at least 5x greater than the HCM software market.","Welcome to the Larry Ellison Investing SchoolThere are many, many investment styles and shortcuts. Some of us like to use a bottoms up approach in terms of analyzing companies and then seeing if that analysis yields a positive conclusion regarding the shares. Other people use all kinds of technical signs. Another style is contrarian and still another style concerns insider sales. They all work from time to time.I have another investment technique that is my little secret that I am going to share with you. It is called the Larry Ellison investment signal. Larry Ellison, you may recall, is Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) founder, chief technical officer and chairman. He is also the sponsor of US entries in the America's Cup races. There are few people on this planet with a competitive drive equal to that of Mr. Ellison.But over the years of doing this, I have noticed an interesting correlation. Companies that he singles out for especially rough treatment during Oracle conference calls often turn out to either be Oracle's acquisition targets down the road or singularly decent investments. For years, Mr. Ellison made a habit of disparaging Siebel Systems - and then he bought it. For years, he made a habit of disparaging PeopleSoft and then he bought that. For years, he disparaged BEA Systems and then he bought that. He became close to apoplectic regarding Netezza in the big data space - and Netezza was bought by IBM (NYSE:IBM). Of course, the indicator doesn't always work - one has to actually do the work to confirm the signal. Once upon a time, Mr. Ellison spent several calls bashing Teradata (NYSE:TDC). It is still an independent vendor that hasn't yet been acquired, although I keep hoping.So, when Oracle reported its earnings this past Tuesday evening and Mr. Ellison spent tons of time bashing Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY); I thought perhaps this might be an interesting story to write about. Now, Mr. Ellison's hatred of Workday goes back several years from when the company was just getting started, but some of his comments during the conference call were vintage Larry. And, indeed, essentially a whole paragraph in the Oracle earnings press release was devoted to Workday bashing.Workday is hardly an undiscovered name. It has only been public since the end of 2012, but it has an enterprise value of $12 billion and revenues have recently crossed the $1 billion/year mark. It has yet to reach non-GAAP profitability, although that is expected this year. It does generate significant cash flow, although unfortunately, most of that is a product of stock-based compensation which is still rising faster than revenues. But my thought is that if Larry Ellison and Oracle hate it so much and consider it to be a threat worthy of a paragraph in an earnings release, there is likely to be something there.Will Workday ever reach GAAP profitability?Many commentators often pose that question to me when I write, as I often do, about software companies whose business models are totally subscription. I really believe that there are perhaps a few misapprehensions, or urban myths if you will, regarding the management objectives in running hyper-growth companies. Every management in this field has the same objectives in terms of maximizing profits and return on capital. The stocks are never really going to work if there isn't some sound and consistent way of valuing how well these companies are doing. The issue is that what I and other observers think of as sound valuation methodology may not be the same as what other readers find acceptable. No one deliberately sets out to build a company that will never be GAAP earnings positive.I really do not think that any of these companies are not aware of the potential earnings dilution from stock-based comp. The CEOs, the CFOs the VCs of all of these companies have run those kinds of numbers for many years. I think the major difference that they have is that they see different opportunities than do many readers. And honestly, that is as it should be.If you are starting up a company such as Workday, with the challenges inherent on taking on both SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle in their sweet spots, you had better have some innate optimism or you will never achieve your goals. When one looks at a company like Workday, you can either believe that management understands its market and understands what it takes to beat Oracle and SAP, or you really shouldn't even think about investing in the company.I am surely not going to reprise the arguments about GAAP and non-GAAP presentations. Of course, stock-based comp counts and has to be considered, but this company's management has carefully considered the question of the cost of stock-based comp and has decided that it is a tool they ought to continue to use. On the conference call held the last day of February to announce the earnings, the CFO suggested that the budget for stock-based comp will continue to be at 23%-24% of revenues for some time into the future. But he also made the point to observe that every single option grant involved in stock-based comp was anti-dilutive. That being said, non-GAAP net income will run 25 margin points higher for non-GAAP than GAAP for at least the next two years. If investors feel that valuations based on cash flow and bookings are inappropriate, Workday is not the right investment to consider.But regardless of where one stands on the debate between GAAP and non-GAAP earnings presentation, the fact remains that outside the issue of stock-based comp, a GAAP earnings presentation is wildly off base in illuminating the financial health of subscription based companies such as Workday. Workday booked a $290 million GAAP loss in its latest fiscal year, an increase from the $247 million loss it recorded in its prior fiscal year.On the other hand, it generated a positive cash flow of $258 million which is a difference of not less than $548 million from its GAAP loss. That's a huge difference for a company whose total revenues in its last fiscal year were all of $1.15 billion. Of that $548 million difference, a bit less than half - $249 million to be precise - is stock-based comp. But $266 million of the difference came from the increase in deferred revenues which is another way of saying that the subscriptions this company actually sold and for which it collected money were $266 million greater than its sales.Depreciation and amortization rose $25 million and accrued expenses rose by $60 million while accounts receivable rose by $105 million. That is more or less a wash and those are items that will continue to increase as Workday grows. So, Workday generates lots of cash and it does so at an increasing rate. At the end of the day, cash generation is what it is all about. I think that a business model that is capable of delivering a substantial level of cash generation is positive for shareholder values.But beyond the cash generation, this company created another $600 million of off-balance sheet revenues, almost all of it to be collected in the next couple of years. At this point, Workday enjoys gross margins of 84%. I do not know if Workday has recognized the sales commissions it will have to pay when it recognizes the revenues. Some companies in this space account for commissions when they are paid, although many do not. I do know that the cash involved with the commissions has been paid. When salespeople bring in guaranteed deals that are beyond a year, they still insist on getting paid if the deals are watertight.How much is that $600 million worth in an economic analysis of Workday's profitability? There really are no cash requirements to collect the money. Presumably, the asset could serve as the basis for a collateralized loan. The fact is that the company generated $258 million and it really ""generated"" another sum that ought to be considered as the net present value of the $600 million in non-cancellable future revenues. I think that almost any company and any management team considering those kinds of results would be foolish and not maximizing shareholder value if it decided to reduce current operating expenses in order to lessen or eliminate its GAAP losses.But to the question about ultimate GAAP profitability, management is essentially forecasting that this company will be non-GAAP breakeven in its current fiscal year. That's really consistent with margins it has achieved in its past fiscal year. I would guess that this is another example of management conservatism. The company will deliberately de-emphasize its services operation in order to better feed its partner ecosystem. As it makes almost no gross margin on professional services and an 84% gross margin on subscription revenues, the change in mix is going to increase operating margins by at least 200 bps and perhaps a bit more in the current fiscal year.CFO Mark Peek stated that the company would start to plan for operating leverage for fiscal year 2018 which is basically 12 months from now. He suggested that ""the company will continue to prioritize growth versus margins while maintaining our longer term goals of 20 plus percent operating margin."" But in the meantime, the company will grow its base of on-balance sheet deferred revenues by a bit more than $300 million. The company doesn't actually forecast the growth in its backlog of non-cancellable, non-balance sheet revenues. But it seems reasonable to believe that asset, however much it might be worth, is going to show a significant increase as well.This company does not specifically forecast operating cash flow. That being said, the company suggested that the growth in cash flow this current fiscal year would rise at least as fast as the growth in billings. Thus, the company's forecast for operating cash flow is $338 million. Given the make-up of the company's cash flow for the current year, I would be surprised if cash flow did not expand considerably greater than forecast.Without appearing to be cavalier in my treatment regarding the goal of reaching GAAP reported profitability, I think a company that is generating quite as much cash as this one does and is creating a substantial asset of significant value to shareholders, is following an appropriate financial strategy. It simply wouldn't make sense for a company with this kind of opportunity to sacrifice the building of its license revenue asset base in order to achieve GAAP profitability.Why does Oracle management hate Workday?Lions and Cape Buffalo seem to have some kind of genetic markers that cause the two species to hate each other. These days, quite sadly, most Democrats seem to despise Republicans and the favor is returned. At various times through the years, Oracle has hated numerous competitors. At one point, Oracle's management seemed to save most of its hatred for the emerging supply chain vendors. Subsequently, it hated Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). For several years, until Oracle bought it, management regularly disparaged BEA Systems. When Oracle entered the data appliance business, it started to hate HP (NYSE:HPE), even though it used to love HP when later the company supplied it with servers. (I think it qualifies as hate when a company runs a weekly ad on the front page of the Wall Street Journal every Thursday for perhaps 90 weeks in a row, disparaging competitive products. To me, it was unseemly, unnecessary and a waste of shareholder money. But then again, I don't run the second largest software company in the world or have multi-million dollar yachts to race.)For several years now, dating back to at least 2012, before Workday even became a publicly traded company, Oracle's management in general and Larry Ellison in particular have articulated strong negative sentiments regarding Workday and what it was trying to achieve. In those long-ago years, Workday had subscription revenues of less than $90 million while Oracle was selling more than $10 billion of software. And yet, here is a quote from the Oracle earnings press release that was issued at the end of its fiscal 2013 year (ended May 31), ""Furthermore, in Q4, our HCM cloud alone generated more SaaS revenue and added more new Fusion HCM customers than Workday added HCM and ERP customers combined in their most recent quarter."" There are many, many things that might be said about a company with literally 100X more revenues comparing itself to an upstart that Workday was at that point. At this writing, Workday has grown something more than tenfold and Oracle has shrunk, but the rhetoric is still the same. If it wasn't accurate all the way back then and hasn't been accurate since that time, why should anyone choose to believe Oracle's forecast for Workday at this point?Essentially, all of the growth that Workday has enjoyed has had to come from displacing both Oracle and SAP customers. Currently, most of Workday's revenues come from the sale of HCM systems. Depending on which market research report one reads, the HCM software market is anywhere between $12 billion/year to as much as $20 billion/year.Much of Oracle's growth in HCM software has been the product of acquisition. It bought PeopleSoft in 2005 and then it bought Taleo, which at that time was the #2 ranked vendor in the space. In 2012, SAP acquired the market leader in the space called SuccessFactors for no less than 10X trailing revenues. So presumably since that time, SAP has had a competitive product in the space. None of it has seemed to slow down Workday all that much. Needless to say, consolidating the native Oracle HCM application with the products offered by PeopleSoft, which used to be the market leader, and with Taleo and moving everything to the cloud was a major undertaking for Oracle. Here is what Gartner had to say about the process in August 2015, ""The reality is that Oracle acquired Taleo, which itself had acquired Learn.com. They have multiple technologies that are now aggregated into a comprehensive cloud suite, but still reflect lingering integration challenges…""Sadly, there is not yet a Magic Quadrant for precisely what Workday does. Gartner refines the market into Talent Management and Talent management + HR. As one might expect, there will be a Magic Quadrant for that new sector, but it will not be available until some time this year. In the meantime, we have to go on what Gartner says the buyers want from their HR software. Gartner says that 56% of potential buyers are looking for ""best of breed"" as opposed to solutions tightly integrated with the rest of their stack. And Gartner says that 77% of the users in its survey wanted a purpose built integrated Web solution. It is pretty straightforward to infer from the research that Workday has a solution that resonates better with prospective buyers than the solutions currently being offered by either SAP or Oracle.There really is no objective way to even begin to try to figure out whether or not Oracle is growing faster than Workday. In Oracle's quarter that was reported last week, total cloud revenues were $583 million and Workday had revenues for the quarter of $261 million. Are more than half of Oracle's cloud revenues really HCM? I very much doubt it. Subscription revenues for Workday last quarter were up by 44%. The comparable Oracle figure is either 57% or 40% - one can pick the cloud revenue figure that is preferred. 57% is really the most comparable number. Oracle's booking growth in USD was about 70% for the period and Workday's growth was a bit over 60%.Oracle seems to be growing a bit faster than Workday when just looking at cloud HCM applications alone, although it is by no means clear that the numbers are really an apples to apples comparison as Oracle lumps everything into cloud sales, and because of acquisitions, Oracle started with a relatively high base of HCM sales. On the other hand, if one looks at the HCM space as a whole, I think it is self-evident that Workday is gaining market share at the expense of its legacy competitors in the overall HCM market which is not growing at anything close to 44%.Why does Oracle's management hate Workday quite so much? It is pretty simple in that Workday is gaining overall share in the total HCM market at an accelerating pace and is now attacking the financial applications market as well. I can't evaluate the competing solutions - but based on the survey data that is available, it seems that users want to buy more product from a best of breed competitor (Workday) than they do from an integrated supplier (Oracle) and that is probably extremely frustrating for Oracle.In addition, there is a history of bad blood between Dave Duffield, one of the founders of Workday and the founder of PeopleSoft back in 1987, and Larry Ellison. When PeopleSoft lost its way and was unable to remain independent, it was Mr. Duffield who stood in the last ditch to resist the takeover.As the saying goes, turnabout is fair play and while I doubt that the founding of Workday had much to do with a desire for revenge, inevitably Mr. Ellison took it that way. And of course, unlike the other independent cloud vendors who have grown up in the past decade, Workday is unique in not using any of Oracle's infrastructure - not even its database.Workday presents the visible alternative of a totally Oracle-free world and that is a vision that simply drives Mr. Ellison nuts. Mr. Ellison hates to lose in general. Losing to Dave Duffield and other executives who left PeopleSoft to start Workday must be doubly galling.O.K. - We understand why Oracle and Workday are like the Hatfields and the McCoys - but can Workday realistically expect to win?By now, this is not quite a David and Goliath story. It would be nice if we could get some straight market share data and track what has been happening since Oracle decided it needed to get serious about the cloud. Absent that, we have to piece the story together as best as we can. The portents, I think, look quite reasonable for Workday.Most industry commentators believed that last year would be the year that Oracle, and to a lesser extent SAP, would get serious about trying to do something to hurt Workday. Oracle, at this point, only has one real lever and that is price. There are always those ""sources familiar with the situation"" and when it comes to price competition in enterprise software, they tend to be software salesmen. And the stories of Oracle discounting like crazy to win deals or even better to discourage renewals for Workday abounded. Oracle has many products to sell and Workday had but one. It would seem as though Oracle had to win the struggle. It might seem that way, but the results belie conventional wisdom.Back in May 2015, which perhaps seems like an eon ago to some of us, WDAY put up a quarter that was said to be disappointing. Of course, disappointing is in the eyes of the beholder, but WDAY was no doubt a highly valued name. In the event, there were those at the time who felt that forward revenue and billings guidance was less than had been anticipated and that this result must have been a function of Oracle price competition. The shares fell from $92 to $79 on the day after the earnings release and have never really recovered.In the event, the concerns going back 10 months ago were never realized. Revenues turned out to grow about $40 million more than guidance and the bookings metric was particularly strong since it grew at something more than 50%. One takeaway from all of that is that the CFO of this company guides very conservatively. When a company beats earnings estimates consistently and by a significant amount, it is reasonable to surmise that management is deliberately contriving to achieve earnings beats as a goal. Nothing wrong with that - investor relations 101, really.The huge bookings increase is something else again. The CFO commented that large customers just slightly expanded the length of their contracts by about 2 months relative to a year ago. That is a huge number - how huge we don't know because we don't know the length of year-ago contracts. But if customers are signing contracts that are on average perhaps 10% longer, it certainly might explain some of the bookings overage. Needless to say, however, Workday is simply winning more against its principal competitors. The company expanded its customer count by 10% - not for the year but in the last quarter alone! This is a company that already has 1,000 customers. (Note: It is traditional in the software industry to count each division of a company as a separate customer. That is the way they measure customer acquisition so I have to follow suit.) Some of the new customer wins were simply huge. Some wins included Airbus (OTCPK:EADSF), Marsh & McLennan (NYSE:MMC), Kohl's (NYSE:KSS) and Hoffman-Laroche. Those are self-evidently competitive displacements. There are no companies of the size of those organizations who lacked an incumbent HCM vendor before they chose Workday.I would not normally quote commentary from company management regarding competitive win rates since I think most win/loss reports are the spawn of the Devil. But in this case, and for what it is worth, the CEO suggested that WDAY ""enjoyed historically strong win rates against both of our legacy competitors SAP and Oracle, and our win rates were highest in the large enterprise market…""I think that the other component of market dynamics is that Workday is actually now starting to displace Oracle and SAP with regards to financial applications. At this point, financial apps are not a huge revenue contributor for WDAY, but it is its presence in large accounts that makes it so difficult for Oracle to try to compete on price. The financial services market is said to be something more than 6X the size of the HCM market.Oracle's price offensive against Workday wasn't irrational at all. It just seemingly has failed. And with the first major go-lives in financial apps coming during the 4th quarter of last fiscal year, it is going to be very hard to put the genie back into the bottle. HCM is, no doubt, a large market, but it is not the core of the software business for either Oracle or SAP. Financial apps really are. Oracle could and has competed very vigorously with WDAY on price in regards to HCM accounts. It simply cannot afford to do the same for accounts that are buying both financial services and HCM. Oracle and SAP have competed for many years with regards to financial applications and the rules of the game were pretty well understood. The advent of a viable 3rd party who is apparently offering a better product at a lower price point in an environment in which tectonic plates are shifting as the world moves to cloud has, I think, been inadequately appreciated.I confess that I was not particularly familiar with J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT). But it is not an insubstantial company, with revenues of $6.2 billion and 19,000 employees. Apparently, it was the go-live of a customer of that scope who is using the complete management suite of WDAY financials that has been a significant factor in opening the floodgates. Management said in its prepared remarks that its pipeline in financials was up over 150% year on year.I think that the data suggests quite strongly that WDAY is really winning the competitive struggles, at least in HCM at this point. Most companies of scale simply aren't able to expand their customer base by 10% a quarter and do so with household name wins. I think a better question rather than ""what is happening?"" is why it is happening. I really cannot completely answer that question, not because of any lack of impartiality but because of the lack of data. No Magic Quadrant and really very little help from the usual industry consultants. So about all I can do is quote what WDAY's management said in response to the question as to why they were winning. CEO Aneel Bhureri, a company co-founder, said, ""I'd say first and foremost what's impacting our competitors, our legacy competitors in particular is their inability to get customers live and in production, especially the large customers. And I think when both companies, when SAP and Oracle moved into the cloud they were given a bit of a hall pass… But at the end of the day, we all get measured about customers being successful and in production and they failed… but in the large part neither really embraced a true cloud model and I think they are paying the price for that…""I don't purport to have the technical background or the resources to evaluate the validity of the claim. But it is essentially the same answer that I heard when I investigated the reasons for the business success of Salesforce.com. Neither Oracle or SAP has embraced real cloud technology and that is hobbling their efforts to win customers who are putting their legacy installations up for bids as they move to the cloud. If the issue of performance is really true and the performance issue is because of the inability and unwillingness of the legacy vendors to truly embrace the cloud, then yes, I suspect that Workday will continue to be successful and will continue to gain market share and probably grow a bit faster than is the common perception at this time.Alright - But how about trying to justify this valuation. I am still not totally wowed by that non-GAAP earnings presentation, but even if I don't consider that, isn't this stock overvalued?As the old saying goes, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. I am very well aware that WDAY has an EV/S of 8X on current year sales estimates. But that number drops to around 6X for the following year. And the year after that? How many years of 30% growth can this company put together or will growth gradually move down to 25% or to 20%. There is going to be a fair amount of controversy surrounding that point and some readers, no doubt will take the other side of the argument.Beside that, this company will not have visible earnings until next year and even then no one will possibly want to buy this name as a value play. It isn't!But cash flow and free cash flow metrics are of a bit of comfort. I imagine that free cash flow for the current year will increase to about $225 million. That represents a free cash flow yield of 1.8% - derisory one might say, but again, it isn't all that derisory if it can grow at 40%/year for 3 or 4 years.The shares are significantly cheaper than they were before they cracked up at the end of last May. The share price since then is down by 22% and it is 10 months further on and the company has grown another 45%. It would, in hindsight, have been optimal to pick the share up below $50 as they were priced at the February 8th bottom. I am sure there are investors who were able to book the trade and make 47%, but it is awfully hard to trade against the received wisdom of the day.It is my belief that the shares are undervalued because I do not think that most investors either appreciate or believe that this company has a much larger business opportunity ahead of it than its business opportunity in HCM. I have no idea if this company will be able to achieve the kind of market penetration in financials that it has in HCM. But if it even achieves half that level of success, the company is going to sustain a growth rate of 30% or higher for some years to come.I imagine even fewer people believe that WDAY provides users with a more usable solution when compared to either Oracle or SAP. I really do not think it is sales execution. Not too surprisingly, WDAY's senior sales executive, Phil Wilmington, was at PeopleSoft, both during its glory days and during its decline. He has only been at his current job a bit more than a year. The success that the company has had is not likely to have been a function of super-human sales execution.It is really hard to imagine that companies the size of Bank of America, HP, DuPont, Schwab, ING, Abbott, Delphi, Hitachi, Panasonic, CarMax and Equifax would have chosen to switch from long standing vendor relationships with either Oracle or SAP unless Workday is really offering something quite a bit better. By their nature, large companies are very conservative and loathe to change vendors if there is even a reasonable chance that their requirements can be satisfied by the incumbent.It might be one thing for Oracle and SAP to lose customers when neither of them really had a competitive cloud product. But now they say that they do and they say that they are successful and they are still losing customers currently as the same rate they were losing customers in the period before they were offering a cloud solution.While it might sound like hyperbole, I simply do not remember either Oracle or SAP losing quite so many installed, high visibility customers to an upstart competitor in any similar situation. It is sort of like incumbents in our Congress. You just do not see them turned out of office all that often.About 70% of Workday's HCM customers have gone live using their Workday solutions. That means that Workday has a host of reference accounts which is not something it necessarily had even a year ago. It seems to me that the combination of having large reference accounts in production, coupled with some kind of distinguishable product benefits, is likely to allow Workday to continue to improve its competitive performance vis-avis its legacy competitors.I haven't written all that much about WDAY's financials simply because to date, it isn't a large part of its revenues. But there are two points to make regarding financials for WDAY. One is that it is inherently easier to have two products to sell as opposed to one. Not everyone feels that it is quite necessary to have the latest and greatest HCM solutions. It is hard to be cavalier about financials, and particularly financials in the cloud.While the portents seem promising, it is perhaps, too soon to tell if Workday can have the same success in financials that it has had in HCM.Overall, analysts remain a bit skeptical regarding Workday's prospects. The shares are rated 2.2 by the Thomson First Call consensus with a mean price target of $75. That is a better set-up for share price appreciation if everyone was already in love with the name. There are a fair number of analysts who simply don't believe the story and the short interest is 13% of the float.Some Closing Thoughts!We all know that Workday's shares are highly valued. And we all know that Workday spends just less than 25% of its revenues on stock-based comp and has piled up large GAAP losses as a result.What may not be appreciated is the level of cash flow that this company has been able to generate and its rather significant bookings success against both Oracle and SAP at the end of the company's last fiscal year. It is very rare, if not to say unprecedented for companies of the scope of Airbus, Hoffman La Roche, Marsh & McLennan and Kohl's to give up their legacy vendors and move their HCM platform to a far smaller competitor like Workday, all in a single quarter.In addition, Workday now seems to have a proof point of size that validates its financial services software and is referenceable. The market for financial services software is at least 5 times the size of the market for HCM software.The issue in making an investment decision regarding Workday at the end of the day comes down to two factors. One is the competition with Oracle and SAP. The other is the ability the company will have to sell financial apps to a similar extent to its success in HCM.If you believe that Workday has seemingly overcome the worst that Oracle can throw at it and yet survived, the shares are a decent buy. Why? Because if that has happened, WDAY is going to be able to continue to grow at 30% for another 3+ years as it continues to exploit its competitive advantages.If you believe that not only has Workday blunted the competition with Oracle but will have a success somewhat similar in scope in financials, as it has had in HCM, then these shares are a great buy. At the end of the day, it really isn't more complicated than that."
3970295,22670,2016-05-02T15:50:13-04:00,"An industry-expert driven analysis of Workday concluded that it is a great company with a risk-laden valuation (due to an accelerating threat from SAP and Oracle).Workday is in the early stages of expanding to provide Financial applications. It has touted some large reference accounts, but we believe those accounts were lured with sweetheart deals.This article provides a transcript from a industry-expert interview, which casts further doubt on Workday's bull thesis.","Two weeks ago, we issued a Pipeline Data Newsletter report providing an industry-expert analysis of Workday (NYSE:WDAY). It concluded that Workday is a great company. However, its stock poses much risk for investors.This is primarily due to SAP (NYSE:SAP) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). The two software giants are ramping up their Human Capital Management (HCM) offerings, which threatens WDAY's stranglehold on the segment. This comes as HCM faces the decelerating growth that affects maturing markets.To combat this, Workday is in the early stages of expanding into the Financial applications space. Gaining traction here will be critical for the maintenance of its valuation.Wall Street is bullish. We are not so sure. Financial applications have high penetration rates, low attrition rates, and few catalysts for defection. Movement to the Cloud is certainly an incentive for customer upgrades. However, this dynamic heavily favors incumbents.This is in stark contrast to the client/server migration cycle, which saw heavy Y2K-driven defections to the client/server architectures offered by SAP, Oracle, and Workday's predecessor, PeopleSoft. In other words, we don't see history repeating itself for Workday. This is particularly bad news because PeopleSoft's good fortune still wasn't enough to save the company from a steep valuation slide, which eventually led to an unwelcome takeover at the hands of Oracle.To gather as much evidence as possible, we have continued interviewing as many industry contacts as possible. Our network consists of systems integrators, company contacts, recruiters, and industry experts from leading firms like Gartner Group/AMR Research, Forrester Research, and International Data Corporation.The following transcript personifies the feedback I recently received. This particular interview was with an industry expert who advises buyers looking to purchase HCM offerings, like those provided by Workday. I view it as a critical piece of the puzzle to figure out if Workday's stock will continue its upward trajectory... or collapse into the 40s again.Mark Gomes: Hi, I just wanted to get your thoughts on Workday. What I'm trying to figure out here is ... I'm sure you don't follow Financial as closely as HR, but I've looked into the Financial side of things. What I'm trying to figure out is when the price pressure and competitive pressure from SAP, Oracle, might start to really start to have an impact on the sales cycle, lengths, the pricing, and the momentum of Workday on the HCM side.Pipeline Data Contact: Yeah, that's an interesting question. I can't say that I've got full visibility into the answer, but I'll share what I know. I think that you are ... the Financials has been lagging and still is lagging around Cloud adoption and shift to the Cloud. I'd say to the tune of at least 4 years, maybe 5. Financials and HR, if you rewind back to the last big shift around client server in the mid 90s, you had this looming event called Y2K that everybody had to fix. A lot of aging Financial infrastructures there, I mean Walker Financials for goodness sake and a bunch of other old, old integral systems.When someone like PeopleSoft came and they had already penetrated into an account with their HR, they were able to go to the CFO and say, ""Hey, we have this new Financials thing."" It's on this new platform. It'll fix your Y2K and also delivering some differentiating capabilities that other Finance systems didn't have. A CFO would put all of those pieces together and say, ""Yeah and my HR Department has had good experience with PeopleSoft so let's go with their Financials.""It's a little bit of a different story here in that it's been on the Financial side much more of a, ""If it ain't broke, why am I moving this to the Cloud?"" Except for some industries that are still really wanting HR and Finance to be together. Higher ED, often times professional services with that tight linkage of Finance and HR via activities and a few other industries. That's one of the reasons why Workday's Finance stuff has been slower to catch on just to a different market dynamic in this day and age.Now they're reporting some uptake in numbers in adoption and I think that there's a potential of some pressure coming in. At HCM World, for Oracle, Cloud ERP is the only thing in the mid-market that those Reps were selling and lots of interest apparently. I guess we'll wait and see what the numbers are going to look like when they report them, but they have talked about pull through the other way around - HR being dragged in or being taken along by a Financials upgrade to the tune of potentially as much as 30% of those ERP deals.If we take a look at that and what that pressure might bring on Workday. They've been leading in HR and the Oracle and SAP have both cracked the 1,000 customer mark. Workday is at maybe around 1,200. Workday has got a higher percentage live and therefore more live customers of that over 700. Oracle and SAP have 500+ live customers on their Cloud offerings. In the end, many see Oracle's Finance product as being a more product robust offering just because of the heritage of E-Business Suite and PeopleSoft Financials being built into that application.Mark Gomes: Right. Very interesting. Yeah, it's funny because the PeopleSoft reference is really valid from my standpoint and maybe even more so. I have to think that these guys have a little chip on their shoulder than what happened originally and may really want to succeed this time around in that way that PeopleSoft did not. I don't see how that happens. They've done a great job with the core of what Workday does best and that came as no surprise to anyone. When there's another architecture shift in the future, I'm sure they'll do it again, but...Pipeline Data Contact: Yeah that was the fundamental looming event and it was that perfect storm combination. If you looked at what PeopleSoft Financials brought, they had something called tree structures that enabled financial analysis and they had a fancy reporting tool called nVision that delivered the financial analytics and insights in a way that the other apps didn't. This combination of the need to change, both for aging architectures and Y2K, so somebody had to do something. Here's the solution that brought some differentiating capabilities and you combine that with the good customer experience that their HR colleagues were having. It was a, ""Yeah, we'll make that investment."" It's just a different set of market dynamics right now.Mark Gomes: Right. I agree. That being said, HCM is still a fairly hot area and maybe the growth rate is decelerating a little bit. I'd like your insight into how quickly. What's of interest to me, how long do you think before the decelerating growth rate, the accelerating adoption of Oracle/SAP HCM, and the pressure they're providing start to actually have an impact on Workday that we might see show up in their quarterly results?Pipeline Data Contact: First off, let's address the broader market issue that it's often times a bit difficult to untangle the market opportunity around conversion because in the end there's very, very few greenfield opportunities. We don't have anything for HR out there that these folks are fighting over. Everybody is coming from something. The tricky part is, if you look at the deal dynamics. If it is an Oracle customer, they are looking at basically 2 options around Oracle. Do we take a big move to the Cloud? Do we adopt their global HR and their talent? Do we upgrade the admin core HR and stay on either PeopleSoft or E-Business Suite or JD Edwards and then do talent in the Cloud? Buy ourselves 5 more years to shift over completely to the Cloud when we see those Core solutions a bit more mature… or do we a rip and replace and move to Workday?Then from a sourcing perspective, usually the sourcing requirements would mandate that they have at least 1 or 2 other solutions to look at. The question becomes who because often times you have either a red shop or a blue shop. Often times, you wouldn't see SAP being brought in as the third player there. It might actually be someone like Ultimate Software that has a great value, very strong US presence and expanding global capabilities in improving functionality. It might be someone like Infor now that they have the CloudSuite story. It could be another regional player if it's a non-US geography.It's a similar situation on the SAP SuccessFactors side. The good news for Workday is they are the main thing being evaluated as an option in both of those customer bases. I think that's going to continue because you have 16,000 SAP on premise HCM instances out there. Now a third of them are under 1,000 employees and they're tucked away in remote geographies out of reach of Workday, but just call it 9,000 that would still be ones that would be looking at making that move to the Cloud and saying, ""Do we move to the Cloud in pieces or all at once on SuccessFactors? Or do we look at something else like a Workday or a regional alternative?""Again, who comes in to pay as an option might be an Infor or someone regional. What's in Workday's favor is you've got those guys, you've got 9,000 or 10,000 SAP conversions that need to happen over the next X number of years, call it 10 at a minimum, and you've got 4,000 PeopleSoft customers. Now many of them are choosing to upgrade to 9.2 because their North American payroll is something they depend on and they don't see that the Cloud payrolls are as mature as they want them to be. A similar situation with 1,200 or 1,500 E-Business Suite customers. There's still a lot of things to be settled over the next 5 years around these customer bases as well as a bunch of other old legacy stuff like people who want to move from ADP or Infor, Lawson, and the like that just aren't seeing enough progress by their current vendor.I think there's still a lot of opportunity there in terms of customer base conversion, but a lot of competition trying to take that as well. New offerings by Ceridian with their DayForce in the US market, Ultimate Software I already talked about. There's still a lot to fight over is my net on this and Workday still has that premium price position. Oracle is very aggressive in defending their customer base and putting some pressure on terms and conditions as well as still coming out as the lower cost TCO for at least the first 5 years for an existing customer because they just ease the way on the transition versus having to pay upfront for Workday.Mark Gomes: Right, absolutely. Of course, SAP and Oracle both know that taking next-to-nothing up front ensures getting a lot more later on.Pipeline Data Contact: Right. Yet in Workday's favor is still well above average satisfaction of their customers, very reference-able customer base, satisfaction with both product and service criteria. Oracle's kind of in the middle, a little below average on product, a little above average on service. SAP success factors, below average on both product and service although they made a dramatic improvement on the service side.Mark Gomes: Right. That brings up an interesting point, both from a technology curve perspective and a customer satisfaction perspective. How much longer can Workday stay ahead of the curve in terms of functionality as this market matures? Obviously, it becomes easier for the competition to catch up. Then from a customer service perspective, they're already at the top and the other guys are gaining ground and that gap has to shrink over time, right? It's just a matter of how quickly.Pipeline Data Contact: Right. The other part about that too is how much of Workday's customer service differentiation is achieved at the expense of profitability? So what happens? Where do they cut back in order to make the endeavor profitable. Oracle and SAP SuccessFactors assert that their Cloud business lines are operating profitably. So, does Workday trim back in marketing? Do they trim back somewhat in development because they've gotten most of the way there in terms of product feature and function? Do they keep investing in service and support to maintain that edge or do they make different choices? And what happens when they get outside their cabbage garden of North American domestic and US based multinationals and are fighting it out in Europe with European headquartered or APAC headquartered multinationals.Mark Gomes: I actually believe that they're ramping up many expenses to handle many of the things you just discussed. It's a very critical time for that company. They've had a heck of a run. I think now we're like ... you can see the inflection point somewhere in sight. I don't know if it's right in front of our faces or a few quarters away.Pipeline Data Contact: To me I think that there is still opportunity certainly in HCM and Workday's challenge is how to continue reaping that while putting the right level of investment to bring that integrated Finance and HR story to bear. It's not lost to me that they shifted their marketing message a bit ago to Finance and HR together. They led with Finance and that's on purpose. Basically say, ""Hey, we're not just an HR company."" Yet they still need to keep that HR base satisfied and growing. So far, they're still managing to do that.Mark Gomes: Well, from the perspective of a stock investor, they have to maintain momentum - the second derivative. They could grow 15% a year for the next 5 years, but that's not enough to keep the stock moving properly. The stock would actually drop...Pipeline Data Contact: Yeah because they positioned themselves as a growth stock. Right so that's how we see...Mark Gomes: As a high growth stock.Pipeline Data Contact: Yeah, to justify those multiples.Mark Gomes: That's right. At the same time, I'm starting to hear some grumblings from people inside the company that the culture has changed. It's becoming a lot less fun. They're becoming a lot more serious and readying for a bigger battle. The people that were there early thought it was a fun place to be. I guess they didn't think they were going to be going into a war against SAP and Oracle.Pipeline Data Contact: Well the competitors don't just roll over and die especially when they're the size and the scale of an Oracle and an SAP. The empires are striking back.Mark Gomes: Right. Well, thanks for the time!_________________________Conclusions: I'm not sure that the timing is perfect to short workday, but I am becoming increasingly confident that day is coming. In the meantime, the shares have rebounded from a low of $47 to a recent high of $80.Analysts are bullish and seem to be putting a lot of weight into the early traction Workday has reported for its Financials offerings. In my mind, that prices in a lot of success. Meanwhile, it's no secret that I believe the stock market to be topped out (or nearly so).So, my bottom line is this - Considering the fact that Cloud software vendors tend to get crushed in a correction, it seems that there are currently more ways for short sellers to win with Workday than there are for the bulls."
3960536,46261,2016-03-23T13:25:16-04:00,"It is very hard to change existing corporate culture, mindset and brand positioning.Workday is more user friendly and has better brand image and marketing.Millennials are increasingly becoming a dominant force in many corporations. Workday seems to understand them better than Oracle.","In my first article on Workday (NYSE:WDAY), I approached the company from the financial analysis angle, in which my conclusion is clear - Workday is overvalued by my standards, pricing in too much future growth. But that doesn't mean Workday is a bad company with bad products. Just the contrary. If I should define my overall stance on Workday, I would say it is a great company with bright prospects selling at a high price. I would definitely be a buyer if the price is right.I've covered the massive margin gap between Workday and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), which sure is one factor helping Workday win over customers from Oracle. But let me explain why I think the price is not the only reason why Workday continues to attract Oracle's customers. It is also about Workday's ""customer first"" mindset.Workday is about cutting-edge user experience - about putting the user first. The user-friendliness of the system that facilitates the necessary but boring administrative tasks for employees is becoming a key HR tool for employee satisfaction, retention and new talent attraction.Therefore, at the right price, I would love to turn from a seller to a buyer of Workday's stock one day because I like their focus on the customer, which I believe gives Workday a competitive advantage against Oracle and SAP (NYSE:SAP) that will be harder than many believe for Oracle and SAP to close.User-friendliness of the corporate systems is becoming very importantThe boring, mundane reporting and administrative work is a major pain point of almost all large corporations. This is especially the case for managers who are expensive yet they have to spend many hours every week doing mundane reporting, approval and administrative tasks that they simply can't outsource for security or responsibility reasons. Similarly, sales people usually hate reporting. It's the antithesis of their communicative, outgoing, face-to-face nature. These clumsy systems take time, and more importantly, energy of the workforce.Millennials are becoming a dominant force in corporate employment and decision-makingThe previous point is becoming more important as the younger and even more tech-savvy Millennials are entering the workforce today and climbing the corporate ladder to the managerial positions. Technology keeps marching forward and Millennials consider a user-friendly app, working well on a tablet and a smartphone, an absolute minimum standard of what they consider an employee-friendly work environment.The internal corporate systems need to be user friendly in order to attract and keep top HR talent, motivate people and let them be productive. Millennials have extremely low employer loyalty, are very demanding in terms of the corporate culture, the work environment and the usage of modern communication and productivity tools. They also are likely to endorse and use brands that they personally believe in, or admire, as consumers. They care more about how they feel at work, how flexible the employer is and how they can grow personally than about the paycheck.As Millennials gain influence in corporations and become decision-makers, they will naturally choose solutions that are modern and user friendly. This is a definition of Workday, and it is also an antithesis of Oracle and SAP. Oracle is an IT company run by IT people for IT people. Workday is a company solving people's problems.Corporate underinvestment in people and systems (replaced by buybacks) will revert to meanI believe there is massive underinvestment in people and systems going on in the corporate world today. Corporate buybacks are the favorite flavor of the day. Some short-sighted businesses risk being obliterated by modern, fast-changing newcomers. Workday is growing rapidly even today. Once companies start investing more again in people and systems in order to remain competitive, Workday will benefit even more.It is hard to change an existing corporate culture and brand imageThis ""customer first"" approach is easily copied in theory but very hard to replicate in practice for Oracle and SAP due to their existing corporate mindset, products and managers. Oracle and SAP systems feel intimidating. Workday feels more friendly, accessible. There also is a massive generational gap. Workday is a company where Millennials want to work and do work, whereas Oracle and SAP are companies where their parents work and arguably don't really want to work as much as for Workday.Suffering a sleeping disorder? Play an Oracle presentation and you will fall asleep immediatelyOne reason why Workday is winning Oracle's clients could be tied to the presentation materials. Consider the following randomly selected examples of communications materials (graphics and video) from Workday:Screenshot of one of Workday's product pages:hereherehereAnd then have a look at a couple of Oracle's examples:Oracle homepage cookie consent:hereherehereThese randomly selected examples clearly demonstrate the marketing communication strategy of each company - Oracle describes their systems (features), whereas Workday solves people's problems. This is part of Workday's pro-customer orientation (customer first) versus Oracle's and SAP's ""systems first"" mindset. They are at the core of Oracle's problems with Workday. This is about a corporate mindset and the appearance of it.It looks simple to change but the problem is deeply rooted. The problem starts with the people who manage these products at Oracle and SAP. I'm sorry to say but they need to be replaced... 25- to 30-year-old college graduates should be hired and listened to in order to redesign the products and especially their interface and presentational layer. Marketing communication needs to be significantly improved as well.People don't care about the cloud. They care about user-friendlinessLet me make an outrageous assumption. I actually believe that most people have absolutely no idea what a ""cloud"" means. When they want a ""cloud"" solution, they are really looking for a user-friendly, flexible, scalable system that they will be able to access and use anywhere, on any device - a system that will help them effortlessly cut the administrative and analytical clutter and get the mandatory but mundane tasks done as conveniently as possible.Systems are for people. People need to be on boardIt doesn't matter whether the system is the best or the second best (if the difference is not major), whether it is on-premise or in the cloud (if it meets other requirements of course). But, what is extremely important is whether its users embrace it or not. Getting the users on board is the most important goal when implementing a new IT solution. If the users don't really believe in the system and hate to use it, then the whole IT investment is a waste of money and will only consume more time and energy of the workforce and deliver poor or negative ROI, because people will only use it as a necessary evil and will try to avoid it. I've seen it many times.ConclusionAs Millennials become the majority of system users and decision-makers in the companies they work for, these companies will more often choose Workday over Oracle or SAP. I would like to buy Workday stock one day if it becomes cheaper.My advice to Oracle is very simple but very hard to do in practice. Change your entire DNA. Focus on the customer (user), not on the system. Act more like Workday, more like a B2C company although you are not. There are people at both ends of the B2B relationship. It still matters to be people focused. Unfortunately, I believe Oracle's mindset and corporate culture can't be changed without replacing its key decision-makers. I'm afraid the entire product management, brand and marketing team has to be replaced and significantly rejuvenated.Hire young, 25-year-old Millennials to take care of marketing, communication, user experience and the presentation level of the applications. While this sounds easy, I know how hard it would be for Oracle to do any such thing politically - every manager is entrenched and the corporate structure doesn't support a swift change, unless it comes directly from a strong CEO. This is exactly what gives Workday a great opportunity to continue stealing Oracle's customers."
3953996,20521,2016-03-04T04:18:42-05:00,,"Workday (NYSE: WDAY) continues to compete and beat Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) at their own game. The company has shown how to uproot legacy vendors like Oracle and SAP by offering a cloud-based solution. In the last quarter, Workday replaced Oracle at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and signed 40 new customers within the cloud-based financial management space at the expense of Oracle and SAP. According to Workday, every large customer that it is winning is replacing either an Oracle or SAP implementation of legacy software and now, it is replacing them in the cloud-based application segment as well.Workday's FinancialsFor the recently reported fourth quarter, Workday's revenues grew an impressive 43% over the year to $323.4 million. It ended the quarter with a net loss of $0.01 per share. The market was looking for revenues of $319.6 million with a loss of $0.05 per share. This was the thirteenth successive quarter since the company went public 14 quarters ago that it reported results that surpassed market expectations.By segment, subscription revenues grew 44% over the year to $261.8 million and professional services revenues grew 38% to $61.63 million.It ended the year with revenues growing 48% to $1.16 billion and a net loss of a penny per share compared with a loss of $0.33 per share reported a year ago. This was the first year that Workday crossed the billion dollar annual revenue milestone - a remarkable feat considering the company is only ten years old. It is also the third purely cloud company to cross the milestone with salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) being the other two.The market wasn't too impressed with its outlook, though. For the current quarter, Workday projected revenues of $337 million-$339 million, falling short of the Street's forecast of $343 million. It gave an outlook of revenues of $1.54 billion-$1.55 billion for the year compared with the market's expectation of $1.55 billion.Workday's Improving OfferingsDuring the quarter, Workday continued to improve its market offerings. It announced plans to extend partnership with ADP to provide multinational organizations with a seamless and unified global payroll experience. Through the partnership, Workday's Human Capital Management and ADP's Global Payroll applications will be integrated within a single user experience in the Workday application. The integration will also help with tracking legislative updates from ADP that can now be made through the Workday user interface to ensure that customers follow the required regulatory process.Last month, Workday realigned its sales team to a structure that allows these teams to sell both financial management apps and human resources applications into key accounts. Earlier Workday was selling through different sales teams for different products. Its key to success lies in its ability to get organizations upgraded while minimizing both cost and effort. Legacy applications like those of Oracle and SAP are both mired with past releases where upgrades are costly and time-consuming. Workday's cloud offering allows organizations to free themselves from this painful tangle of legacy software applications.Its stock is trading at $71.91 with a market capitalization of $13.81 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $93.62 in May last year. It touched a 52-week low of $47.32 in early February.According to a report by Market Research Media, the global HR software market is projected to grow 2.4% annually to $9.2 billion by the year 2022. It doesn't appear to be a very fast-paced market, but Workday clearly is not bothered as it continues to eat into other vendors' market share by harnessing the growth in cloud-based HR software market. Analysts estimate this market grew 21% last year and is expected to grow 10% annually through 2019."
3502806,22148,2015-09-11T14:59:56-04:00,Workday has traded sideways for a couple of years as multiple compression takes over.Investors shouldn't be fooled by high analyst price targets with the negative trend towards lower targets.The stock faces more multiple compression going forward that will impact price gains.,"The tech sector is littered with stocks over the last couple of years that came public at excessive valuations and headed higher for awhile. The market justified these sky-high prices due to fast growth rates and a new paradigm in cloud computing or social media.One of the stocks that got caught up in the excitement was Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY). Over the last couple of years, the stock has actually gone nowhere outside the runaway excitement that peaked in early 2014. With the stock retracing the 2014 lows of around $65, is now the time to load up on the stock?Fast Growth Not EnoughFor FQ2, Workday produced an exceptional 51% billings growth. The company easily surpassed analyst estimates, yet the stock is mostly down with the market since that report.Even more interesting is the lack of gains with the stock now trading around $70 though several analysts have price targets at over above $100. If anything, the stock action further highlights the key direction of price targets over the absolute numbers.Cantor Fitzgerald has an out of the park $125 target on Workday suggesting a nearly 80% gain from the current levels. As equally incredible, analysts from Canaccord to FBN to Nomura had targets in the $100 range before recently adjusting numbers. Both FBN and Nomura cut targets by $15 providing examples that the direction of the price target moves is more important than the actual number.Multiple Compression Not OverWhen Workday soared above $115 back in early 2014, the stock traded at one of the highest PS ratios in history outside of the dotcom era. It is nearly impossible to justify a valuation in excess of 20x forward revenues, much less approaching 40x forward revenues.When viewing the valuation of Workday to industry leader salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), one can quickly grasp where the PS multiple eventually ends up.With salesforce.com growing revenues around 20% and Workday up at 40%, one can probably justify the current valuation of the latter. The major issue though is that Workday likely ends up with the multiple compressing close to 7x sales.The implication is that when Workday hits $2 billion in revenue in FY18, it could easily trade for a market value of $14 billion. Sure the stock could maintain a 10x sales multiple for a $20 billion market value, but the upside over the next two years appears in the 50% range to possibly no gains.The downside risk though is that the stock remains over valued if it maintains that high multiple.TakeawayThe key takeaway is that Workday is more attractive now than any time since the IPO nearly three years ago. The stock though isn't extremely cheap based on the above metrics. The odds though are for flat to positive returns over the next couple of years.Workday provides another great learning lesson for investors chasing momentum stocks. When the momentum changes, fast revenue growth and great long-term prospects aren't enough to generate positive returns for investors."
3929556,46261,2016-02-25T12:08:22-05:00,"Workday's sales growth is slowing down and more slow-down is anticipated by the company.At the same time, margins have been flat or getting worse.Competition is willing to sell at a loss or breakeven to keep the platform.Despite the 50% fall from its peak, very optimistic assumptions are still currently baked in Workday's current price.A pairs trade with IBM or peers will likely deliver solid returns.","Workday (NYSE:WDAY) stock is not having a banner year, down ~28% year-to-date. The price also fell ~38% in the past 12 months and the stock lost 17% in the past month alone to now trade at $57 per share. This is roughly 50% below its 2014 peak.Investment thesisHowever, I believe there is much more downside for Workday ahead in the long run as the markets realize the ""cloud"" and ""app"" companies' profits pie is significantly smaller than the combined valuations of the companies already in the marketplace, let alone all the new ones that continue to spring up, fueled by easy money being thrown at anything that calls itself a ""cloud"" or ""app.""I believe a pairs trade with peers or IBM will deliver solid returns.The incumbents adding fuel to the fireThe incumbent companies themselves are using their raised cash to add more fuel to the bubble by allocating funds to support new ventures. This is a classic self-reinforcing loop (George Soros' The Alchemy of Finance is a fantastic book).Please don't get me wrong - I believe the R&D model of supporting new ventures is actually smart but the aggregate sums of money being thrown at the ""cloud"" and ""app"" space will simply kill individual growth and profitability of almost all participants. The incumbents, especially Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) but also SAP (NYSE:SAP), are willing to sell individual components of the cloud solutions that cover Workday's products (HR and Finance) at a loss in order to defend their platform with the customer. Once this price war wears out the players constantly losing money or breaking even at best as a company to make a sale, such as Workday, the tide will turn and the outrageously high P/S multiples of the money-losing companies will compress. The tide will turn, the industry funding will dry out the sales growth rates will slow down, reinforcing this multiples compression. I believe we are witnessing early stages of exactly this happening.Workday: almost all metrics are deterioratingThis leads me to Workday. The stock has clearly been priced by the market using the P/S multiple. Although I would never buy a company using this ""valuation method,"" I have to use it in order to anticipate the future stock price of Workday until the fundamentals return. Since the sales growth rate is what is holding the P/S multiple and the share price up, the company absolutely needs to keep the top line growth rate high in order to support the share price. But the sales growth has been slowing down. And the margins have been flat or slightly deteriorating at the same time.Sales growth is an absolutely crucial metric for Workday's stock priceWhile sales increased on a quarterly as well as a year-over-year basis and the share of subscription revenue continues to rise, the year-over-year growth rates of quarterly sales have been decelerating for at least four quarters in a row, moving from 68.19% to 59.50% to 57.11% and 51.35% to reach 41.94% during the most recent quarter. This is a very bearish sign showing a prolonged deterioration in the top line growth momentum.For the full fiscal year 2016 ending the next reporting quarter, to be reported in a few days, the company itself guides for a deceleration of its top line growth to 40% to 41% YoY. And for the upcoming fiscal year, the management expects a slowdown of growth to ""just"" ~30%-plus. This is a significant slowdown given the lofty ~10x P/S valuation.Net margin continues to shrinkLet's move on from sales to margins. Net profit margin has been deteriorating again for two quarters in a row, moving from -27.86% a year ago to -26.28% to -24.53% and -24.56% to reach -25.49% most recently. This continued margin weakness is a reasonably bearish sign showing a potential for a more prolonged trend of margin deterioration.The new Financials product seems to be a drag on margins as its share of sales increases. It seems the new growth segment for Workday carries lower margins and an even tougher competitive environment. As per the company, the flexibility on financial terms of the sale was most often used in this new Financial sector product.Payment terms needed to be adjustedWhen a company has to adjust its payment terms and offer more flexible financing, it's a clear sign of tougher competitive pressures and a hunt for top line growth at the expense of margins as the company plans to ""leverage our balance sheet and the strong cash flows of our backlog to add flexibility in payment terms to the most complex of customers, particularly in Financials"" The competitive pressure is in the large organizations and Financial services. Given that Financial services is Workday's new growth product, this is only more troubling.Revenue growth rates will be impacted, though the company's FY2017 outlook already accounts for this: ""revenue recognition can be impacted by the amount of cash we bill and we anticipate this will impact subscription revenue growth next year by up to 5%, but will increase our backlog.""Costs to acquire and keep (renew) customers likely to rise furtherThe company has many Fortune 500 customers, including Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX), using various subcomponents or the entire platform. However, the market is clearly becoming more crowded. Workday will run out of the large new clients that have plenty of cash to spend on its services and are very efficient to handle (high revenue per customer). As the company is forced to move toward acquiring mid-sized company customers, the sales efficiency will drop, and the costs per each new dollar of revenue will rise. The prices charged to the smaller customers are very likely to be lower per the volume of service and costs incurred. At the same time, the payment terms or discounts will need to be stretched further at three-year or four-year contract renewals as the market continues to be more and more saturated with competitive offers. This is already happening as evidenced by Oracle's efforts, for example.Oracle is willing to sell at a loss in order to keep the platformWhen facing a choice to sell a customer one product at a loss in order to keep the platform and future cross-sell and profit opportunities, Oracle's selling of human capital management solution at a loss or at breakeven makes complete sense. The solution then becomes a ""door-opener"" that enables it (or Workday) to sell future products at a profit. Oracle's GAAP net profit margins are roughly 25% positive. Workday's GAAP margins are about the same, but with a negative sign. That's a margin gap of 50 cents on every dollar of sales. Workday's business model is clearly unsustainable and a price war against Oracle and SAP can't be won this way in the long run. And Workday is clearly at a price war with Oracle, SAP and many other competitors in a fragmented industry with relatively low barriers to entry and high margins of the incumbents that continue to attract newcomers and new investments.Peer valuationServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) has very similar top line growth to Workday, a bit better negative net margins (just below -20%) and trades at just above 8x P/S while Workday trades at roughly 10X P/S. That makes Workday 25% overvalued relative to an already lofty valuation for ServiceNow.Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) still has a top line growth rate of ~23% most recently, which is not very far away from Workday's planned 30%-plus growth for the next fiscal year. And Salesforce.com operates roughly at breakeven whereas Workday has double-digit negative margins. Yet Salesforce.com trades at below 7x P/S. Relative to Salesforce.com, Workday also is overvalued by roughly 25%.Oracle trades at a P/S of just over 4x. Of course, the growth stage and revenue makeup is different. But Oracle has an almost 25% net margin. So a 4x P/S is probably a maximum P/S/ where Salesforce.com and Workday are headed over time, and most probably lower. So Workday would need to roughly triple its sales from current levels in order to justify its lofty future valuation, and let's not forget that Oracle has ~25% net margin. Such margin is hardly achievable for the cloud industry as a whole and Workday in particular due to severe competitive pressures for the most lucrative clients. Given the overall industry's top line growth rate is roughly 20%, I believe Workday will have a hard time to keep outgrowing competitors and the overall industry growth rate for a long time.RisksAn acquisition of Workday would surely destroy the short thesis. In an industry with high but slowing growth and rising competition, a consolidation is almost inevitable. So this is clearly a risk.Cloud is one of IBM's (NYSE:IBM) four ""strategic imperatives,"" so the company is aggressively spending in this area. So far, it seems they don't want to compete directly with Workday but rather IBM wants to have the most complete HR and financial services cloud offering, letting the clients to choose between SAP, Oracle and Workday. But what if one day IBM decides it wants to take part directly? Workday would be an obvious acquisition target. With cloud being one of the imperatives (which usually translates into top line growth at any price), IBM could overpay for Workday (pay the current price plus an acquisition premium). This would clearly be a negative for my short thesis. Here is my latest take on IBM.Also, if Workday keeps boosting sales growth even at increasingly negative margins via further share dilution and convertible debt issuance, it could become the industry leader in terms of size, quality and breadth of its products. I admit this also is a risk that I am aware of. The company has plenty of cash on hand to keep losing money for years. Also, there's lots of room do decrease costs by lowering the share-based compensation temporarily. On the other hand, it clearly costs the company more to generate lower and lower sales growth rates. So I'm positive this mechanics will make sure Workday is not able to grow its way into its current market-implied valuation.ConclusionA very rosy future growth and profitability scenario is currently priced in. Workday offers very poor long-term expected return and lots of downside risk and uncertainty. It is a good long-term short against cheaper peers and IBM. With a 50% net margin gap between Workday and Oracle, and with deep-pocketed competitors such as Oracle and SAP searching for growth and protecting their platforms, thus willing to battle for Workday's customers and services below breakeven costs, Workday has poor odds to survive the battle in the long run.On the other hand, there is a risk of industry consolidation in which one of the competitors acquires Workday at any price in order to acquire top line growth, get rid of a major competitor and end the margin wars.Even with this risk, I would rather buy a no-growth IBM (no growth partly caused by the strong U.S. dollar) at roughly 10x FCF multiple that benefits from Workday's growth and their fight with Oracle and SAP than buy Workday at 10x P/S that is threatened by competitors and engaged in a price war while paying out 20% of sales in share-based compensation."

Though still a minor contributor to overall revenues (~16% as of Q2, both on a 3-month/6-month basis), given the speed of growth it would not be a stretch to expect the international segment to account for a quarter of the company's revenues by the end of FY2017.In the SaaS industry, wins beget wins largely due to the fact that the sales force can use prior wins as a selling point, which is a very compelling buy-case for a potential customer, given that there would be empirical case studies that the sales force can cite in order to demonstrate ROI. The fact that management cited that their competitive win rates were greater in Q2 than in Q1 supports this assertion going forward.Q2 was also a milestone quarter for Workday, as its customer base breached 4-digits (i.e. 1,000). With 70% of their customers live today (i.e. 30% non-live), this offers the investor a meaningful degree of revenue/billing visibility going into the remainder of FY16.Cross-selling appears healthy, indicating decent ROI on R&D, continued emphasis on customer satisfaction is a plusIn the context of cross-selling, the firm is doing well in that regard as well, with ~150 customers (~80 live) using their financial management offering. Not only does this validate the company's R&D efforts, with 150 customers signing up it seems that the offering should be a hit with the SaaS provider's existing (and of course, potential) customer base. I would not be postulating this if say, only 20 customers signed up and the figure has seen sluggish growth q/q. The fact that ~15% (or 150) of the company's existing installed base were willing to sign up suggests that the offering is not likely to be a flop.WDAY seems to be able to capitalize on R&D, given that its older offerings (relative to the financial management offering) are doing well too. Its recruiting offering was made available last spring and has since been cross-sold to >300 customers (95 live). Therefore, when the Delaware-incorporated firm announced its planning offering (scheduled to launch in CY2016), which when combined with financial management & HCM will enable customers to unify real-time finance and HR data with analytics and enterprise planning (i.e. all three products are highly complementary), I have high hopes that this offering would be easily cross-sold to its existing installed base. Future product launches include Workday Inventory which is scheduled to launch in CY16 as well. Though these yet-to-be-launched products won't contribute much (if at all) to current fiscal year results, they suggest that the company's medium-term growth outlook remains stable.In SaaS, there is a common mantra that retaining customers is far cheaper than acquiring customers. This strikes me as essentially true, and it is crystal clear that WDAY is focused on retention as well. The company endeavors to shift its customers to Workday 25 within two hours (compared to four hours for the prior iteration), with a future goal of zero down-time. With minimal operational disruption, this is sure to keep customers happy and increase stickiness tremendously (with limited downtime, I can't imagine any customers wanting to switch back to legacy on-premise applications).Finally, the company's ""Workday Rising"" annual conference will be held next month (28 Sep - 1 Oct). Not only does this increase publicity and presumably generate meaningful mindshare for the firm, it has should also result in quantitative rewards, given that the company managed to sign 20% (of 200) companies who attended the conference in the prior year. Generally, conferences involve minimal investment to set-up, and with such great ROI (evident from the prior-year sign-up rate), I continue expecting WDAY to organize similar conferences year after year. Though the firm does not specify whether present customers attend the conference, I am pretty sure some of them do, and these annual conferences would allow customers to voice their feedback regarding WDAY's offerings, undoubtedly improving retention rates further.Strong dollar unlikely to be a headwind going forwardDespite the fact that most multinational corporations are currently struggling with currency issues stemming from a strong dollar (largely a function of the market's perception that the Fed will be the first central bank to raise rates), WDAY is minimally affected given that the vast majority of their revenues are derived from the US.However, given their growing international exposure that I mentioned earlier, this may soon change although I doubt the effects would be meaningful. The international segment is growing from a rather small base (it is ~5x smaller than the US segment), thus currency-related impact should not be seen for a few fiscal quarters at least. Though one would be skeptical regarding a strong dollar's impact on international demand, this worry should be largely assuaged by the fact that international sales continue to see strong y/y growth (~50%, as I mentioned above). Moreover, since customers are essentially outsourcing their HCM (among other things) needs to WDAY, there should be minimal attrition even if currency issues worsen, given the inherent stickiness of the business model.Wall Street estimates appear plausible implying no meaningful upside from current levels, LTV/CAC remains strong, indicating future growth is likely to be highly profitableThat being said, the company had a strong Q2 considering that growth rates seem to be holding up - Q2 revenues were up 51% y/y, subscription revenues were up 56% y/y, and professional services revenue rose 37% y/y. Given my prior commentary regarding the company's short- and medium-term growth outlook, I expect these numbers to remain steady. We might even see acceleration in the medium-term (not the short-term, given the time taken for the sales force to ramp), considering that WDAY increased headcount to 4,500 (from 3,150 in the prior year) and has intentions to grow this number to ~5,300 to end the year. This assertion is supported by the fact that gross margins for professional services were down 260bp sequentially, with management citing a greater mix of consultants which were not yet fully ramped during Q2. Given the continued hiring, I expect gross margins for professional services to continue coming under pressure.WDAY provided revenue guidance of $1.15b-$1.158b, which implies a y/y growth rate of ~47%. Wall Street's expectations seem to be a tad higher at $1.16b. Given steady y/y and sequential growth (see below), as well as successful cross-selling in recent quarters, the company seems poised to perform in-line with Street estimates. It is possible that WDAY may exceed Street expectations (given their annual conference next month, where it is likely they'll sign many new customers), though when one considers the relatively long sales cycle SaaS companies experience, it is more likely that the effects from the conference will be felt in Q4, if not the Q1 next fiscal year.Source: SEC Filings, author's calculationsAs seen above, gross margins on subscriptions are steadily improving on a sequential basis, driven largely by increasing subscription revenue. With incremental subscription gross margins approaching 85%, one should expect minimal margin expansion going forward. As unearned revenue has also been steadily improving during this period (up 5% sequentially, and 42% y/y), not only does this indicate that the firm's business appears to be healthy (an unhealthy SaaS company could show steady revenue by simply working off its existing billings backlog), it also suggests minimal churn, supporting my earlier assertion of the high retention rates that WDAY experiences.With WDAY disclosing new customers added during the quarter (per the SA press release), we can get a feeling of its customer acquisition costs and customer LTV.Source: SA Press Release, SEC Filings, author's estimatesGiven that WDAY does not disclose customer acquisition costs, I have sensitized the figure by assuming customer acquisition costs as 60%-80% of S&M spend, considering that we know a majority of S&M spend for SaaS providers is on new customers while a minority is dedicated to retaining existing customers. Considering that WDAY has healthy levels of LTV/CAC ranging from 3.8x-5.1x per my estimates (a LTV/CAC of 1x implies break-even), I remain unopposed to the company's continued focus on adding new customers. After all, SaaS is a ""land-and-expand"" industry. Till LTV/CAC levels drop off significantly, I do not expect the company to show any meaningful GAAP profitability going forward due to the inherent revenue-expense mismatch in the business model.With a high probability of WDAY posting results in-line or slightly above Street estimates, I do not see any meaningful upside to be realized going into the remainder of FY16."

SaaS-based enterprise services provider Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) has been doing well in this market. In fact, in the recent quarter, the company managed to sneak in a profit. It's hard to predict if they will manage to retain this profitability, but for now, things appear to be looking up.Workday's FinancialsWorkday's second quarter revenues grew 51% over the year to $282.7 million, ahead of the Street's forecast of $274 million. They ended the quarter with an EPS of $0.02 compared with the market's projections of a loss of $0.06 per share.Subscription revenues grew 56% over the year to $223.7 million and professional services revenues grew 37% to $58.95 million. During the quarter, Workday crossed the milestone of over a 1,000 customers globally as they continued to add big names like Pfizer, Cleveland Clinic and Texas A&M to their portfolio.For the current quarter, Workday forecast revenues of $300 million-$303 million, in line with the market's forecast of $302 million. Workday expects to end the year with revenues of $1.15-$1.158 billion compared with the Street's projections of $1.14 billion.Workday's New OfferingsOf late, Workday has been focusing on releasing a financial planning solution for their customers. They announced further updates on Workday Planning, a new planning, budgeting and forecasting application. The financial planning application will be integrated with Workday Financial Management and Workday Human Capital Management suites to become the first system to integrate finance and HR data with analytics and enterprise planning. The application will be available to customers during calendar year 2016 and will allow customers to generate budgets by combining historical actuals with modeling assumptions, collaborate on planning within planning teams to accelerate the budget and forecasting process, and better manage the budgetary cycle of execution, tracking, control and analysis.Besides financial planning, Workday also is expanding their cloud services offerings into inventory and procurement management, focused on the needs of healthcare providers. Both Workday Inventory and Workday Procurement will be available to the customers next year as well. These applications will help healthcare providers manage supplier and group purchasing contracts, track inventory, automate replenishment, drive cost savings through increased compliance with purchasing processes and a centralized dashboard for quicker decision making. Providers also will be able to get a comprehensive view of talent and evaluate the supply chain teams with reference to business goals.Their stock is trading at $70.93 with a market capitalization of $13.5 billion.

3257815,52012,2015-06-16T06:00:00-04:00,"WDAY's bull case relies on achieving high profitability on core recurring business.Indeed, spending huge sums on acquiring new customers can only be justified on the basis of customer life-cycle profits.My estimates of WDAY's core business show it to be substantially unprofitable.This core unprofitability, coupled with concerns about competition, losses per employee and insider selling all continue to have me short the stock.","In late August 2014 I submitted Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) as a compelling short. My basic rationale was that WDAY was overvalued both absolutely and relative to its peers. Moreover, it was my belief that this overvaluation was largely due to Wall St. turning a blind eye to stock-based compensation and its impact on company profitability. In October I followed the original article up with additional data taken from then-recent M&A activity which suggested that WDAY should be valued at no more than 11X sales, but probably much less than that (I proposed 6X sales as a fairer price).Since that time WDAY has continued to grow revenues at a breakneck pace (with the latest quarter coming in at 57% YoY), yet its price and P/S ratio have fallen slightly:WDAY Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsWDAY data by YChartsMoreover despite what bulls would consider good quarters since the original article, WDAY hasn't really grown into its earlier valuation, as can be seen from its still incredibly high multiples:So why hasn't Wall St continued to focus exclusively on revenue growth as it had in the past - and in so doing pushed the stock to even higher levels?My belief is that the bull story - of obtaining initial contracts at any cost, but then making it up over the customer's life cycle - is beginning to be questioned. Or to put it another way, the costs of supporting a customer after he's been signed are now estimated to be much higher than initially forecast.In the following sections I'll examine why such profitability concerns might be impacting WDAY's stock price (and may continue to do so in the future).Land and Expand Strategy in QuestionWDAY recently celebrated its 10th year in business, so one would think that by now - even if incremental sales and billings are obtained at a loss, or at breakeven respectively - at least the core (recurring) business would be basking in profitability. Unfortunately, as far as I'm aware, the company doesn't break out the numbers necessary to confirm this, so I'll take several stabs at parsing the data to estimate the performance of the core business.One way to look at the financial performance is to begin with year-over-year comparables, then estimate the cost associated with acquiring new business each year. The remaining revenues and costs are then indicative of the core (recurring) business' profitability.In preparing estimates for this type of analysis, I initially thought spending $1.25 for every dollar in new revenue would be unthinkably expensive, but running the numbers that way reflected much too poorly on the company's core profitability, so in the table below I upped the expenses associated with obtaining a new dollar of revenue to $1.50; thinking that maybe lifetime profits from existing customers would then yield high core profitability.Here's a basic introduction to my analysis table: The first 5 rows are income statement / balance sheet data from WDAY's 10-Ks. In the lower 5 rows I calculate the year over year incremental sales; assume that the costs of these are $1.50 for every $1 of sales; and then the remaining sales and costs are considered ""core"" recurring values. (So for example if the company decided to spend no money on adding sales, the core sales and profitability would be representative of the business performance going forward.)The results are alarming. Even with the seemingly crazy assumption of spending $1.50 for every new dollar in sales, and after ten years of being in business, WDAY's core business looks to lose 19 cents for every dollar of recurring revenue!These results were so dismal that I wondered if there weren't some other strategy at play. So I decided to look at billings growth vs. core business profitability. Here I assumed that WDAY was fully playing the Wall St. game by spending a $1 of incremental expenses for every $1 in future revenue they billed. The table below shows the results:Here we see that even assuming the very worst case of the company buying every dollar of additional billings for a dollar, the remaining business still produces a 6% loss. Maybe not as bad as the revenue case, but still very concerning regarding the viability of the ongoing ""core"" business model.Parsing the data on either a revenue or a billing's basis suggests that the original bull case for WDAY was wrong. The ""land and expand"" thesis drastically underestimates the costs of maintaining and supporting existing customers. The bull case is often presented as though once a customer has been acquired, going forward he'll provide consistent revenues at minimal costs. This model is true of something like licensing re-runs of a sitcom such as Seinfeld, but it doesn't come close to capturing the costs of supporting and constantly updating software to stay viable in an extremely competitive industry. Hence it's very likely that WDAY has mispriced its offerings with the sole intention of growing customers at any cost.And the aspect of competition appears to only be getting worse:Competitive Forces Likely to Further Impact WDAY's ProfitabilityUntil recently WDAY was clearly at the forefront of the cloud-based HRM space, such that it could set pricing relatively easily (and yet even in that scenario it was completely incapable of operating profitably). But today's situation appears much more difficult, as the advent of serious price competition in the space makes it hard to see how WDAY will ever become profitable:On top of examining core business performance and the competitive landscape, another way to appraise WDAY's profitability is to look at its number one cost, viz. employees. This too leads to a pessimistic outlook:Focus on Employee Growth is a Structural Profitability ConcernIn previous articles I have pointed to stock based compensation (SBC) being a culprit in WDAY's extreme unprofitability. With a few years of data now available we can plot two revealing graphs. First is the company's historical profitability per employee:WDAY Net Income Per Employee (Annual) data by YChartsNext we plot the total SBC and the number of company employees.WDAY Stock Based Compensation (Annual) data by YChartsIt's all too evident that the company gains no leverage by increasing its headcount, and that SBC accounts for about half of the annual loss each employee dutifully generates.So when on the recent conference call the company laments that it can't add bodies fast enough, investors shouldn't take this as bad news, as adding those employees would likely only accelerate losses.The effect of SBC is also seen in insider activity.Insider Selling AcceleratesHere are just the YTD insider trades. Note in particular the chairman's sales and the dollar value of sales in June alone. Of course insiders will get new shares via options, so the dilution is really only a worry to non-employee shareholders, but for them the magnitude of the sales, coupled with the company's core operating losses and the unrelenting losses per employee should be a serious cause for concern.ConclusionGiven the company's unlikely prospects of ever becoming profitable, I remain short with an ultimate target of the stock trading at a P/S << 6. Moreover, if the market truly begins to care about profits, then the stock may not be valued on P/S exclusively, and this would result in an even lower price target. That said, I haven't added to my short position because today's market offers numerous other opportunities to build a diversified short portfolio - and so that's where I've been putting additional short exposure. (See some of my recent articles for other short ideas.)"

It is further expected to grow to $10 billion by 2019 at a CAGR of 10%. SAP (NYSE:SAP) is the leader in the market with 11% share and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is the second-largest player accounting for 9% of the market, followed by Ultimate Software (NASDAQ:ULTI) with a 7% share and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) with a 6% share.Workday's FinancialsFor the recently reported third quarter, Workday's revenues grew 42% to $305.3 million, and exceeded the Street's forecast of $303 million. This was a break-even quarter for it, exceeding the market expectations of a loss of $0.04 per share.Subscription revenues grew 48% over the year to $242.7 million, and professional services revenues grew 23% to $62.57 million.Their recent performance may have surpassed market expectations, but its outlook does not appear as promising. For the current quarter, Workday is projecting revenues of $317-320 million while the market was looking for revenues of $320 million.Workday and Oracle's Bitter RivalryEveryone knows there is no love lost between Workday's founders and Oracle after the hostile takeover of PeopleSoft by Oracle. But their relationship continues to sour even now. During the year, Oracle has been offering heavy discounts to customers who want to sign up for its HCM products. What is particularly worrisome for Oracle is that Workday's applications do not rely on any of Oracle's offerings - neither Oracle's database nor its high-end servers. To counter this competition, Workday is offering billing model changes that are hurting its revenue outlook. According to Wedbush analysts:Workday is also countering Oracle with several product upgrades. It has already entered the financial management market and last quarter announced continued investments in global capabilities for financial management, including the addition of new language translations for French and Spanish.During the last quarter, WDAY released Workday Learning, a new application that will deliver a more personalized learning experience for organizations to help and encourage employee career development. The application will feature collaboration and social learning technologies including the ability to share content on any device, personalized training modules, support for diverse learning experiences that will be able to support various developmental experiences, and a built-in measurement and insights tool to help organizations get an insight into the learning effectiveness. Workday Learning will be integrated into Workday's unified suite of applications and will be generally available to the customers during the second half of next year.The company also released its latest feature release Workday 25, which includes additional financial management solutions including Workday Inventory and additional reporting and analytics capabilities and expanded product translations and localizations.Besides its own efforts, Workday is benefiting from other acquisitions in the industry. Last quarter, IBM (NYSE:IBM) announced the acquisition of Workday's leading service partner Meteorix. Meteorix has over 200 certified Workday consultants delivering Workday's solutions to multi-national companies across a wide range of industries. With the acquisition, IBM could become one of the leading, most qualified and experienced Workday service providers in the world. The move will help Workday expand its reach to new clients and also rely on IBM's might to rapidly implement its solutions.Its stock is trading at $80.48 with a market capitalization of $15.45 billion.

3240536,48411,2015-06-07T02:17:20-04:00,"In doing research into current WDAY sentiment, I came across a report out of Needham that breaks out the HCM bull case.I rebut this case and caution readers against getting long WDAY in size here if that's in fact what is driving bullish analyst sentiment.WDAY isn't heading to zero and no gaping fundamental holes but if the bull case is HCM-based, I think it could be slightly misplaced.","I was doing some ""back track"" research on Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) this morning in considering if I was a bit too harsh in a recent article in which I concluded that WDAY's two primary problems keeping its stock range bound are that 1) I don't think two of its three recent product releases will prove out to be as great as expected (for the most part - I get more specific within the article), and 2) that it has no distinct advantage in competing in several verticals outside of it can aggregate a suite service rather than point solutions (mostly because of its size).Now, obviously those are broad-based claims and they are worth investigating if I'm completely off base, so maybe a read of the above article is warranted before you stop reading this article. The point is, I was giving WDAY a second chance, if you will, or at least a chance to prove me wrong. With shares trading just off the 52-week lows and sitting near a major ""fault line"" I was looking for reasons to come away a bit more bullish than I was/am.In this research, I came across a snippet from a late-May analyst report on WDAY out of Needham (via Benzinga and StreetInsider.com) in which the Needham analyst concludes:It was this last line that really caught my attention because this specifically is something that I rebutted in my most recent take on the company - despite not having knowledge of the Needham report. I really believe that WDAY is not and will not be the domestic entry market or mid-market enterprise choice for HCM. I just don't.First, I think that, smartly, WDAY is not focused on the mid-market enterprise market or below. I think that its competitive advantages, as indicated in the intro, are in its size and umbrella capacity. That mostly serves the upper end of the enterprise market well, and that's what that part of the market is looking for. A comprehensive solution.Second, I think that, smartly, WDAY is making the international markets more and more a focus as those markets (at least to my knowledge) don't have the competitive landscape in the HCM space that we have here in the US. That's a huge plus. The other huge plus is that my favorite HCM names in the US aren't quite big enough to have a non-US focus just yet, so in a land-and-expand market, this gives WDAY a huge head start in the international greenfields.But, as for anything below the upper enterprise market line (domestically), I think now $2 billion market cap (and growing quickly) Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC) and now near $2 billion market cap (and growing quickly) Paylocity Holding Corp (NASDAQ:PCTY) are going to be huge market share takers for this space. Both of those names have single focus on HCM and have, at least from the companies in which I've deployed their solutions, extremely user-friendly and easy-to-learn platforms.They are also both at inflection points when it comes to sales team maturation, product awareness, brand network effect, etc. I just think that WDAY's HCM market share growth and overall growth is not going to meet expectation.So, my broader questions are 1) of the analysts (at least the ones reporting to Thomson) who cover WDAY, how many of them are also holding onto the idea that WDAY is going to see ""execution within an HCM market;"" 2) and further that this ""creates a positive risk/reward scenario for investors in the near term;"" 3) while also thinking ""the company's current valuation assumes almost flawless near-term sales execution to further expand its valuation multiples?""This matters in that this examplifies that the broader community gets that WDAY's multiple might be toppy but that it's still being given the benefit of the doubt from a reco and price target standpoint:I mean just look at those price targets and the fact that there isn't a single sell on the board when it comes to recommendations.That to me weighs this trade heavily toward the risk side even at today's pricing.I think that if I'm right, in the next quarter or the one to follow that the consensus opinion changes to one that WDAY isn't as competitive in the HCM vertical as is now the status quo that we could be looking at a more significant repricing of shares on this ""new normal.""Again, as I've said many times before - WDAY isn't going to zero and has no huge fundamental holes. I just think readers should be careful when looking to jump in at today's pricing based on what the pricing is based on. I hope that makes sense.Hopefully for those long I'm wrong.Good luck everybody."

Only it's chosen to spend it the wrong way. Multiple sources including techcrunch and Venture Beat are reporting that Workday has announced the launch of Workday Ventures.Workday Ventures will act in similar capacity as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Ventures and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) Ventures as well as all the other venture arms of larger parent companies. Workday Ventures will invest in startup companies and assist in development by way of allowing the startups invested in access to management, marketing, and its customer base. In return Workday will get access to inside development at the startups and first track access to integrations and/or positioning in buyouts. Of course, the latter isn't anything that can be contractually agreed upon it just so happens to work out that way. One can imagine all the reasons why.Workday Ventures will have a particular focus on Machine Learning startups. It has said it will invest initially in a batch of 10-12 companies although it should be noted it declined to detail overall invested amount of investment per startup. Management did report, according to techcrunch, that the amounts would be ""significant, yet small enough that Workday wouldn't control the startup"".So, a few things on this development. First, I don't hate this idea I just hate that it's the focus of the company currently. I actually really like the idea of Workday doing what everybody else in its market cap space has been doing for years. Fragmenting overall R&D risk, fragmenting overhead associated with R&D endeavors, and ""shotgunning"" its upside potential. Google and Twitter have in the past been able to greatly utilize their venture arms to improve their models. I think longer term of course today's news is viewed as overwhelmingly positive.Again, what I hate is that this is what Workday is going to roll out to shareholders after watching the equity be range bound dating back to mid-2013. This is what the company has decided to invest in, a multi-year initiative to drive shareholder value at best, instead of looking for immediate term drivers to the yield-less stock. I know, I know ""long-term Workday holder"", you don't care about the immediate term. Well, as I've written in past articles, the reason why The Street has cared about the immediate term and reflected that ""care"" in the stock is because The Street (and everybody else not wearing rose colored glasses and drinking Workday flavored Kool-Aid) understands that Workday is slowing watching the mid and downmarket enterprise markets be swallowed up by competitors and it's watching the upmarket be fragmenting and aggregated by competitors. Workday is seemingly the only player in the upmarket that's standing still. Of course, this is what's prompting Workday Ventures. The obvious need to innovate and the obvious need to plan for the future.But what about the right now? I still think that Workday needs to go out and make an immediate term acquisition, it certainly has the funding and the access to funding to do so. I think it needs to be a company that is growing quickly and can help verticalize its model. Maybe this means that Workday has to stoop to the lows of selling to something other than mid and upper market enterprise. Maybe it means that Workday needs to go out, as Twitter has done very recently, and acquire some Machine Learning so that it can start building core product around its (at that point) existing capacity. Maybe it means Workday spend some cash on a BI company or other analytics engine provider as that is seemingly one of the higher possibility endpoints it wants to work towards. I just think waiting on the incubator is the wrong move at the wrong time. Workday, even for those not concerned with the here and now, is doing its shareholders a disservice in the greater context of the space by not chasing innovation here. The rest of the space is. Admittedly often that doesn't make the ""rest of the space"" right but it does when everybody else is getting a first mover advantage.Maybe I'm alone in my dissatisfaction with this announcement overall. I'm certainly not viewing this as a negative development but in the context of the broader Workday story this is not what I was expecting and this isn't what shareholders deserved. Is this a positive? Yes, for sure. Is this what The Street and shareholders would have preferred most to read about? No. Not at all.I continue to recommend readers wait to buy Workday. The shares should remain range bound.Good luck everybody."

Now, that said I would have sold WDAY off post quarter reporting but not because I disliked the actual quarter, which I thought was fine, but from the standpoint that I still dislike its overall strategy.Apparently - and I guess this recent selloff (which destroyed 3 months' worth of WDAY share price growth) was based on billings or pricing pressure or whatever convenient narrative the pundits want to use - Wall Street wasn't as hot on the quarter as I am. Regardless though WDAY longs are stuck in another three-month limbo as they wait for the company to evidence that it's going to continue executing a range bound strategy or maybe, just maybe, it might get aggressive with that cash pile sitting on its balance sheet.I've rarely seen a company that has this much cash, WDAY has $1.9 billion in C&CE/$653 unearned revenues (up 3% sequentially, up 41% Y/Y) as of FQ1/16 reporting, absolutely refuse to deploy it to pull growth forward.

WDAY isn't in danger of running out either as it generated strong free cash flow both on the quarter and TTM. That's viewing WDAY's liquidity strictly from a self-generating standpoint, let's put aside for a moment that WDAY could use its equity to raise funds and/or finance deals.Why do I think that WDAY needs to go out and buy growth/innovation? Especially in light of recent developments?:Because Workday Payroll is a legitimate service that can compete against the best but is taking time to rollout (internationally) and requires more headcount, according to several WDAY presentations recently, to get ramped to meaningful contribution rates. Because Workday Talent Insights is unproven and I think it will prove out to not be as dialed in as expected - I'm assuming its far less predictive and analytical as advertised based on my chatting with several recruiting experts and even if it is I doubt it shows to be meaningfully differentiated from regionalized service providers for this need. Finally, because Workday Professional Services Automation is a complete commodity that I think will show to be second rate and have to give pricing longer term.Look, I'm not a WDAY bear by any means and I have in no way field tested WDAY's three solutions speculated about above but for all three there are serious enterprise options (ex. the top-market enterprise market which is limited to the usual Oracle, SAP, etc. players) that have proven out to be VERY, VERY productive to customers, especially in the HCM vertical and don't get me started on the project management/optimization side. I think these will fragment WDAY's TAM and its competitive assumptions.Unless the enterprise needs a single solution provider for all the suite of services rather than accepting point providers for ""micro-suites"" like HCM, PPM, etc., which admittedly is the case a lot of the time in the top-market enterprise market and I've conceded that above, I would argue that WDAY is going to have a hard time selling that it has a definitive advantage over best of breed providers in each vertical.Now, WDAY has a bigger S&M budget and R&D budget than the companies I would say it's going to run into on the low and mid-market enterprise sales calls and it fully intends to fill those line items out. But at a core competency level I don't know that it has any distinct advantage if you strip that away. Which, by the way, is what WDAY is doing by self-inflicting the pain of not being aggressive with M&A.WDAY, listen up. Go spend that mountain of cash on buying outside R&D. Go spend it on best of breed technology per vertical. Go buy Paylocity and its network of 401k/insurance/benefit broker/managers. Go buy any number of the private companies that are killing it on the PPM side, etc. Go buy sales talent trapped in small companies with small budgets. Just go buy something and break this range to the topside your shares have been trapped in.I guess I don't ""get"" WDAY and I don't ""get"" its growth strategy. But neither does The Street. WDAY can change this while also improving its offensive and defensive capacity. It just needs to spend.I continue recommend an avoid of WDAY.Good luck everybody."
3218486,73185,2015-05-28T11:20:25-04:00,Shares of WDAY have tumbled 11% following bland Q1 results and soft Q2 guidance.We believe that WDAY's valuation is still too high and consider unlikely suggested growth rates for the cloud computing company.Our calculation yields a 10.45x EV/EBITDA multiple on our net present value calculation of 5-year expected EBITDA.,"Although shares of cloud computing company Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) have tumbled more than 11% since the company's disappointing earnings release Tuesday afternoon, we believe that shares of WDAY are still expensive and that the stock still isn't cheap enough to buy.Despite a Q1 beat, WDAY saw shares tumble 11% after the company gave soft Q2 and FY16 guidance. At the stock's high multiples, high double-digit growth was clearly baked into the stock price. Although WDAY's valuation multiples have come down, we believe that unreasonably high growth expectations are still baked into the stock price.We can see that there's a clear downward trend in WDAY's sales and subscriptions YoY growth, as should be expected for a high-growth company that has posted 70%-plus sales growth and 75-90% subs growth in two consecutive years. Law of large numbers decrees this growth should slow, and Q1's number and Q2's guidance are indicators that this growth is indeed slowing.Management's FY16 guidance calls for roughly $306 million in net revenue in Q3 and Q4, which brings FY16E revenue to $1.135 billion, a 44% YoY increase. Considering Q1 posted 57% sales growth and Q2 is projected to post 46% growth, we can see that Q3 and Q4 are expected to have slower (less than 44%) growth.We believe this growth will continue to fall over the next five years, but believe the high-growth cloud market and growing demand for WDAY services also will keep the growth rates high elative to other industry growth rates. We believe it is fair to assume a 35% revenue CAGR over the next five years for WDAY, appropriately accounting for the cloud industry's high CAGR and the decreasing trend we are currently witnessing in WDAY sales.If we discount our forecasted FY16-FY20 sales at a 8.80% WACC, subtract debt and add cash, we arrive at a current fair value of WDAY sales of roughly $7.5 billion (note: we assign 0% tax rate in calculation of WACC because WDAY has NOLS far in of excess of $1 billion, and we do not forecast WDAY to net $1 billion in cumulative pre-tax income by FY20).EBITDA-positive cloud computing companies, like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and VMWare (NYSE:VMW), currently operate at 10-20% EBITDA margins, and we believe Workday can get to these margins in the next year or two, given increases in revenue and decreases in opex.CRM EBITDA Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsSo if we apply a 20% EBITDA margin to our fair value of sales, we arrive at a net present value of EBITDA of roughly $1.5 billion. WDAY's enterprise value is roughly $15.7 billion, so these calculations give us a 10.45x fair EV/EBITDA multiple.We do not believe that an 10.45x EBITDA multiple is compelling enough to make WDAY a value play at these lower levels. As such, we believe WDAY has more downward movement in its future."
3215966,25120,2015-05-28T15:29:49-04:00,"Workday is selling off after growth expectations have been increasing in recent weeks.The company's guidance suggests a slowdown in sales growth into the rest of the year.While margin expansion is impressive, the company continues to report big GAAP losses.Investors should not blindly focus on non-GAAP earnings as stock-based compensation is a real expense in terms of dilution.Shares continue to be remain an attractive short against parts of the long portfolio.","Investors in Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) have been disappointed by the fact that the company's second quarter and full-year guidance in particular have been a bit light. This guidance seems to suggest that sales growth momentum is slowing down a bit, a concern for investors given the premium valuations.Given the still very premium valuation, Workday remains an excellent short in my opinion, being held against some riskier long positions. Following the news flow I continue to stick with my modest short position.First Quarter ReviewWorkday's first quarter revenues rose by 57% to $251.0 million. This growth rate looks very strong but marks a slowdown from the 59% growth rate reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015. For the entire year of 2015, Workday managed to grow topline sales by 68%.Workday did manage to report some impressive improvements in its margins. Gross margins improved by a full five percentage points to 69.0% of sales. GAAP operating costs came in at 90.2% of sales which marks a big 6.5% improvement compared to the year before, following effective leverage of sales growth. These margins gains combined allowed for a 11.3% improvement in operating losses which now are equivalent to 21.3% of sales. This seems to imply that despite the improvement, Workday is still far removed from achieving break-even results.The combination of the growing revenue base and narrowing losses in percentage terms resulted in a rather flattish development on the bottom line. GAAP net losses increased by a penny to $0.33 per share, equivalent to a $61.5 million loss.Of course these losses are partially the result of share based compensation expenses of $47.3 million, equivalent to $0.25 per share. After adding back other one-time charges as well as debt issuance costs, non-GAAP losses came in at $0.02 per share which marks an improvement from the loss of $0.13 per share reported in the year before.Note that the stock-based compensation expenses are equivalent to $11,500 per average worker. This is a real and quite high expense given that this is based on a three-month period.The first quarter performance has been solid. Revenues came in six million ahead of consensus estimates with analysts forecasting non-GAAP losses of eight cents per share.The OutlookFor the second quarter, Workday sees revenues of $270 to $274 million which implies a 45-47% increase in the anticipated revenues versus the year before. This marks a big slowdown from the 57% annual growth rate which the company has reported for the first quarter. On a sequential basis, revenue growth is seen at just 7-9%. This compares to the 17% increase in second quarter revenues on a sequential basis in the year before.While the guidance is in line with consensus estimates, Workday needs to beat in terms of the guidance in order to keep market participants happy. This follows of course the premium valuation which goes hand in hand with premium expectations.For the entire year, Workday sees revenues of $1.125 to $1.145 billion, which implies 43-45% growth on an annual basis. This implies that revenues in the third and fourth quarter combined are seen at $602 to $622 million. Based on this guidance, sales growth is anticipated to slow down to 36-41% in the second half of the year.Premium Valuation, Cash Is No ProblemWorkday's valuation remains very high on traditional metrics despite the company holding $1.9 billion in cash and equivalents. The company has $496 million in convertible debt outstanding, suggesting a net cash position of $1.4 billion if one does not assume conversion of that debt.The company currently has little over 187 million shares outstanding which values equity at $15.9 billion with shares trading at around $85 per share. After subtracting the net cash holdings, the enterprise valuation still comes in at $14.5 billion.Based on the sales guidance, Workday now effectively trades at 13 times sales. Other emerging players such as Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) trade at similar sales multiple. This business is scheduled to report its earnings later this week. In the previous quarter, Splunk reported a 48% increase in revenues on an annual basis, combined with steep losses.Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) which has been in the spotlight is valued at $50 billion after Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) was reportedly willing to pay $55 billion. Based on the current run rate of $6 billion in sales, this business now trades at 9-10 times revenues. While growth percentages in the mid twenties are less appealing, the company is close to breaking even on a GAAP basis.What About The Recurring Revenues?The new generation of software companies which includes Workday employ the cloud business model. Rather than reporting all the contract revenues upfront, they recognize them. This means that big contract wins provide revenue streams for years, while relative few revenues have been reported yet.These companies stress that this accounting and business model understates the performance as the business grows. Therefore these companies focus on the ""unearned"" revenue balances. These balances grew by 43% to $653.4 million on an annual basis. While this looks solid, this balance was up by just 3.3% on a quarterly basis to $632.7 million. Unfortunately Workday failed to specify how large the impact of a stronger dollar has been on this balance.Final RemarksWhile Workday is traditionally a bit conservative with the guidance, the company is showing real signs of a slowdown in terms of sales growth. Despite the impressive improvements in margins, net losses were basically flat. If the company can maintain the pace of margin improvement it will still take Workday two years before it can break even.Even if operating margins come in at impressive levels of 30%, as those being reported by Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), shares are no obvious buy. Let's assume that Workday is growing sales at 30% for another five years which seems quite ambitious. In such a scenario revenues could come in at around $4 billion by 2020. If the company could deliver on 30% operating margins, after-tax profits could come in at $800 million after assuming statutory tax rates. Even if the company could deliver on this scenario, shares are already trading at 18 times earnings projected by 2020.I have deliberately used optimistic assumption, including a 30% revenue growth rate for the next five years. In all honesty I do not think that this growth rate is attainable given that growth is expected to slow down to the ""thirties"" already in the second half of this year. The margin picture is quite optimistic as well. If growth comes in at ""just"" 20% per year and operating margins get stuck at 20%, earnings could come in at $400 million by 2020. In that case the multiple of 35 times earnings can hardly be called a bargain.For me Workday remains a nice stock to remain short against a portfolio full of long positions. While I appreciate that the stock continues to trade at high levels given the anticipation of growth, I still feel that the stock could trade lower going forward. The still very premium valuation makes it an interesting hedge for long parts of the portfolio."
3214686,24663,2015-05-27T10:03:04-04:00,"WDAY announced very strong fiscal first quarter earnings, by any other company's standard.
        WDAY fell over 8% in response to its earnings; investors called guidance for nearly 40% growth underwhelming.
        This proves a disconnect between the stock and fundamentals, implying that Workday may be a great company, not a great stock.","Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is a great company. I don't care if it trades lower by 20% in the week that follows its fiscal first quarter, it takes nothing from the fact that Workday is a great company, one that's truly disruptive in the software-as-a-service, SaaS, space. However, that greatness does not necessarily mean that it is a great investment for retail investors, which is one thing that Workday's fiscal first quarter report and stock reaction proved.It doesn't matter how fast a company is growing, or how promising its prospects are, if its valuation doesn't support further stock gains then you can forget about it being a great long-term investment. As seen in the chart above, there was a time when Workday supported a price/sales multiple of greater than 35. However, during that time the company was also growing revenue at more than 100% annually, and it's also worth noting that Workday's stock was unable to support such a lofty premium for any sustained period of time.WDAY PS Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsToday, that multiple has fallen to 20, and as seen in its fiscal second quarter guidance, year-over-year revenue growth is now falling below 50%. While Workday is still growing fast, the fact of the matter is that as a company grows larger, its year-over-year growth begins to slow. Also, as its market capitalization increases -- Workday has a market capitalization of $17 billion -- it becomes harder to support lofty multiples.That said, this natural progression of the business cycle takes nothing away from the greatness of Workday. It's still a company that's reinventing the $70 billion Human Resources Management industry, a company that started off managing payroll through the cloud to a one-stop shop for all things HR. This includes new services for HR that weren't possible 10 years ago, such as identifying the risk of losing top talent, identifying top talent in the open market, and pinpointing potential problems in hiring that could be bad for a specific business. In other words, Workday combines big data and the cloud in a way that streamlines and improves HR dramatically.As a result, I have no doubt that Workday will one day command far more than 3.5% of the HR management space, probably a double digit percentage. However, with a $17 billion market capitalization, Workday is already expected to achieve further greatness, and that's why a seemingly exceptional earnings report is met with stock loss.WDAY PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsAll things considered, SaaS industry leader Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) is nearly 3 times more valuable than Workday, and Workday trades with a price/sales premium of 150% more than Salesforce.com. While Workday is growing at twice the rate of Salesforce.com, the big question is at what point does Workday become an attractively priced stock that has long-term upside potential? In my opinion, that price is at 10-12 times sales, a slight premium to Salesforce.com, a deserving premium due to its faster growth. That's not to say that Workday can't still trade higher with a 15-20 times sales multiple, but with a $17 billion plus market capitalization, those potential stock gains are very limited based on the valuation of market leader Salesforce.com.The bottom line is that Workday may be a great company, but it's not a great stock to own. If anything, it's reaction to fiscal first quarter results serve as proof."
3118826,24663,2015-04-30T18:29:47-04:00,"A large tech company is reportedly targeting CRM.CRM has a lot of concerns that could cause problems for the acquirer.WDAY would be a better acquisition target, and could be acquired itself.","Apparently, a big tech company is looking to acquire cloud specialist salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), a company whose market capitalization of $50 billion plus would make it the largest software acquisition in history. While the reasons a technology juggernaut would want to bolster its presence in the cloud makes sense, I believe that Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is a better buy, and that it becomes a very attractive takeover target if salesforce.com is purchased.A lot of people have trouble distinguishing the difference in cloud companies. We all know the terms infrastructure and platform as a service, made famous by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, and that companies like Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are mostly selling the same storage, application hosting platforms, and cloud computing services as their competitors. However, for cloud service providers like salesforce.com and Workday, the difference is night and day.salesforce.com and Workday provide platforms that focus on specific industries. From that platform a software cloud company can grow by expanding its product offerings, branching out into new industries and appealing to a larger enterprise customer base. That said, one of the big problems with salesforce.com is that it has lost this unique angle in the cloud, as it has elected to enter many of those same infrastructure and platform services that are sold by the likes of Amazon and Microsoft. Furthermore, salesforce.com has become a lot less specific in what it offers, somewhat losing its identity through dozens of acquisitions that have sparked growth and shareholder sentiment but also caused costs to skyrocket.In fact, one of my complaints with salesforce.com, and a big reason I think acquiring it is a bad idea, is because it's too hard to assess its real growth. For example, salesforce.com bought ExactTarget for $2.5 billion back in 2013, thereby entering the digital marketing space. Before that it bought BuddyMedia for $745 million to help grow its social media branding business, and last year spent $390 million to buy data analytics company RelateIQ. While acquisitions in technology are normal, I do think the acquisitive nature of salesforce.com, a company with $5 billion in revenue, can artificially inflate and make its growth appear better than reality. This also implies that organic growth is likely well below the 20% shareholders expect this year.Lastly, with salesforce.com being more diversified in the cloud, and having to manage many moving parts within its business, the company's spending has been out of control. In essence, salesforce.com has had to invest a lot of money in a lot of areas to find growth. As Seeking Alpha contributor Paulo Santos identified, marketing & sales costs as a percentage of new revenue has skyrocketed to over 210% from 162% over the last five years. Meanwhile, profits are nonexistent, a bit alarming for a company that has well over $5 billion in 12-month revenue.All things considered, Workday has a much more focused business approach in the $70 billion Human Resource Management space. Over time, Workday has gone from a company that just stored an enterprise customer's employee information and handled payroll to one that now uses big data to help companies recruit, determine appropriate compensation, and help a business cut costs. It has become a one stop shop for human resources as a platform that continues to evolve, and grow via service expansion with a well equipped ecosystem. .Some might think that Workday's focus on human resource management means a smaller market opportunity. But keep in mind, this is a $70 billion market that's growing fast. Furthermore, Workday has grown at a compound annualized rate of 80% over the last three years, and with a market share of just 3.5% it has the opportunity to gain a significantly larger piece of the HR management pie.Granted, despite Workday growing into a company that's on pace to create revenue well in excess of $1 billion this year, its market capitalization of $17 billion is a problem. To acquire Workday a company might have to pay $25 billion, and that's a lot for a billion dollar company. Therefore, to acquire Workday is to have complete confidence in its platform, and to know that it will one day control a large chunk of the HR management space, or more than 15%.Personally, I think Workday will one day own 15% of the HR management industry, and I think that because of its strong ecosystem it is a better acquisition than a salesforce.com whose revenue growth could slow considerably if acquisitions are no longer driving growth and spending slows to maximize profitability. Therefore, in a world where mobile applications are bought for over $20 billion, I think Workday's proven success leads to its acquisition if salesforce.com is acquired."
2715795,24663,2014-11-28T09:47:10-05:00,"Oracle needs help in the cloud, specifically in SaaS.Oracle faces stiff competition from Workday in the future $70 billion HR management industry.While expensive, Workday would give ORCL more than a cloud service, but rather a growing ecosystem.If ORCL doesn't buy WDAY, there are other companies that might.","Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) is a behind-the-scenes company that works to improve the business networks of its 400,000 customers through the cloud, hardware, software, and applications. Historically, Oracle has been a leader of innovation, but also a company that's more than willing to make big acquisitions in areas to improve its business. The most recent was MICROS for $5 billion, which gave the company a great opportunity to capitalize on new software licenses in key industries like restaurants and hotels. With over 70% of Oracle's revenue coming from software, and the company trying to increase its recurring revenue stream, more acquisitions are sure to follow. Specifically, Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) looks appealing.Struggles in the cloudOracle's primary goal is to provide end-to-end business solutions for its customers. Based on where technology is headed, the cloud is one of Oracle's biggest growth markets, a space that Forrester estimates will grow from $72 billion this year to $191 billion by 2020; an industry where Oracle must capitalize.Oracle reported $8.6 billion in revenue during its last quarter. Approximately $475 million, or 5.5% of that revenue came from cloud services. The company's cloud app (SAAS) and app platform (PAAS) sales rose 32% year-over-year to $337 million. Meanwhile, cloud infrastructure (laaS) sales increased 26% to $138 million.While this growth may seem like a good indication that Oracle is well positioned within the cloud, investors should keep in mind that the laaS and PaaS industry grew 49% year-over-year during the third quarter, now creating $14.5 billion in 12-month sales according to Synergy Research. Thus, Oracle is actually losing market share, and has nowhere near the cloud presence of competitors like Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).Gaining a better position in HR managementAnother industry that's becoming more cloud friendly is Human Resource Management, a market that was worth $50 billion in 2013 and will grow to $70 billion next year according to Pacific Crest. Currently, Oracle owns 12.4% of this market according to IDC, but not entirely through cloud applications.Instead, Workday has emerged as the fastest growing company in HR management with its 3.5% share of the market, operating almost entirely in SaaS. While Oracle sells a variety of products and services to meet its business customer's HR needs, Workday is quickly building an HR ecosystem that diminishes the need for Oracle products, and also challenges its end-to-end goal.In the past, Workday would offer basic services like storing employee information on the cloud and payroll. But now the company is utilizing big data to help companies recruit, review applications, and streamline the applicant's submission process. Workday can now help companies find compatible positions to cut operating costs, determine competitive pay for talent, and more efficiently evaluate skills.In other words, Workday is quickly becoming a one-stop shop for HR, an enormous market opportunity that very likely accounts for a significant part of Oracle's cloud revenue and growth.2 birds with 1 stoneObviously, I've already suggested that Oracle should and might acquire Workday, and the initial reaction from most people would probably be that Workday is too expensive. The company has a market capitalization of more than $16 billion, meaning it would be a huge asset for Oracle to digest. Granted, Workday does have $1.8 billion in cash, and no debt. However, with just $650 million in 12-month sales, Workday wouldn't make an immediate impact to Oracle's top line.Albeit, if Oracle were to acquire Workday, it wouldn't be for the present, but rather the future. And as already discussed, these are huge markets that Workday could disrupt for Oracle, long-term. Or, Oracle could take advantage of an HR ecosystem while strengthening its cloud position at the same time. Specifically, such services could appeal to the new customers that Oracle gained in travel, hotel, and restaurants with the MICROS acquisition, as these are high employment industries where HR is particularly important.That said, Workday traded lower after reporting third quarter earnings, but for me, the numbers were very strong. Workday grew revenue by over 68% to $215 million, a growth rate that surpasses the cloud market, implying that Workday is grabbing market share. Not to mention, the company has an unearned revenue balance of nearly $510 million.All things considered, Oracle's cloud revenue growth may be good relative to the rest of its business, but it's not too impressive compared to the industry itself. Given the fact that Oracle needs a strong cloud and HR presence in order to meet its end-to-end business solutions goal long-term, making a big time acquisition like Workday doesn't seem out of the question.Oracle has the cash position in order to make the acquisition work, having over $50 billion in cash and equivalents. Also, Oracle Chief Safra Catz recently acknowledged that the company is number two in applications, a position that's unacceptable, thereby suggesting that future acquisitions are likely. Oracle has already made large cloud-related acquisitions with the likes of Responsys, Taleo, and RightNow.Therefore, acquiring Workday may seem like a stretch, but considering the company's needs and history, it wouldn't be a shock. If not, I wouldn't be surprised to see competitor SAP swoop in with a bid for Workday, which would be a nice follow to the $8.3 billion it dished out for Concur Technologies. The point is that while expensive, Workday does present long-term value, whether it be alone or through an acquisition. My personal bet is that big tech has or will take notice, and that Oracle is not only the most likely suitor, but the best."
2718465,25120,2014-12-01T02:41:12-05:00,"Workday reported solid and continued revenue growth in the third quarter.Investors are not pleased with the outlook which calls for 40% revenue growth in the upcoming year.Given the premium multiples, uncertain profit potential and increasing competition, I continue to trade shares from the short side.","Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) had an unpleasant surprise for its investors last trading week. Despite continued operational growth momentum in the third quarter, investors have been disappointed by the revenue guidance for next year, with debate arising whether the company has been conservative, or whether growth is coming off.Given the very steep revenue multiples, the uncertain profit potential of the business and high expectations, I continue to trade the shares from the short side.Growth ContinuesWorkday reported third quarter revenues of $215.1 million, a 68% increase compared to the year before. Growth has been driven by the subscription business which posted a 77% increase in sales towards $164.4 million as professional service sales were up more than 49% to $50.7 million. Analysts anticipated sales to increase to $205.3 million for the quarter.The total cost base rose by 58% to $266.5 million which results in operating losses of $51.5 million, and marks an increase from the $40.4 million operating loss reported last year. Despite the increase in the dollar amount of the losses, the operating losses narrowed by nearly 8 percent point to 23.9% of sales.Following some other expenses, net losses came in at $59.9 million or some $0.33 per share, which actually marks a six cent increase in the losses being reported.Based on non-GAAP accounting which actually excludes some $47.1 million in stock-based compensation over the quarter, losses came in at three cents per share which marked an improvement from the loss of $0.12 per share reported last year. Analysts have been modeling losses of ten cents per share for the quarter.Fourth Quarter GuidanceFor the current fourth quarter, Workday anticipates revenues of $219 to $222 million which would mark a 54-56% increase in sales on an annual basis, although the midpoint of the guidance only sees revenues being up by 2.5% compared to the third quarter.Unlike previous guidances, the guidance matches the expectations of analysts which have been anticipating sales of $220.5 million, as Workday has traditionally guided above consensus estimates.At the release of the second quarter, Workday guided for third quarter revenues of $200-$205 million. As such, the company managed to report actual revenues some ten million above the high end of the guidance. Traditionally Workday has managed to beat on its own expectations. If the company again would beat the high end of the guidance by roughly $10 million, sales could increase by roughly 62% on a annual basis.The real disappointment resulted from the outlook for the upcoming fiscal 2016 for which Workday anticipates revenue growth to slow down to 40%, down from 66-67% growth anticipated this year. Based on the 40% growth rate and this year's anticipated sales, revenues for next year are seen at around $1.10 billion which is a little softer than the $1.14 billion anticipated next year.Valuation Based On Revenue MultiplesDespite the continuation of losses, investors in Workday don't have to fear about the financial viability of the business in the short to medium term. The company holds roughly $1.83 billion in cash and equivalents, and has just $485 million in convertible debt outstanding, resulting in a net cash position of $1.35 billion assuming debt will not be converted into shares.With some 184 million shares outstanding at the current moment, and those shares trading at around $87 per share, equity in the business is valued at $16.0 billion, which values operating assets around $14.7 billion after subtracting the net cash holdings.On a trailing basis, Workday has now posted sales of little over $700 million, as the current run rate comes closer to $860 million. Based on the current run rate, operating assets are valued at 17 times the current run rate of revenues. Based on the guidance for next year, the revenue multiple drops to 13-14 times.Final ThoughtsWorkday has a few things going in its favor. For starters is a strong track record in terms of growth, still very healthy current growth rates and strong product offerings. Yet this growth, or better said the pace of growth, is very determinant in the valuation of Workday which trades at revenue multiples being equivalent to earnings multiples at which other businesses trade!While arguably, the company has the potential to be able to post strong operating margins at some point in time, operating losses on a GAAP basis continue to come in above the 20% mark, which means the business remains a long way from GAAP profitability. While I recognize that stock-based compensation does not result in cash outflows, and that cash is really not a problem at Workday, it does create real dilution for shareholders.Even so, it remains to be seen what real sustainable operating margins can become at some point in time. For now the valuation relies largely on the pace of growth, and the 40% growth guided for the upcoming year, and this is were the debate gets interesting. Is the outlook really conservative, like it has been in the past, or are growth rates really starting to come off after the low hanging fruit has been captured and competition is starting to intensify?Truth is time can only tell, but given the steep multiples and long road to sustainable profits, I maintain my modest short position."

The two met over brunch and decided that they wanted to start a company that offered cloud-based solutions for HR and financial services. Dave was already a successful entrepreneur who had founded PeopleSoft and Aneel had worked at several leadership positions in PeopleSoft.Soon, Workday was born with the mission of providing a fresh approach to today's global businesses. Workday has successfully leveraged the cloud to provide customers with a platform that delivers a complete view of the organization and provides insight into business events for faster decision-making. They help employees collaborate over multiple devices, use real-time data for decision-making and deliver an intuitive user experience for effective resource management with minimal reliance on specialist information technology, human resources or finance employees.Since its founding, Workday has grown rapidly. Revenues have grown from $25.2 million in 2010 to $468.9 million for 2013. They ended the September quarter with revenues growing 68% to $215.1 million, surpassing analyst expectations of $205.3 million. Subscription revenues grew an impressive 75% to $164.4 million and Professional Services revenues increased 49% to $50.7 million.The company still continues to report losses, however. They ended fiscal 2013 with a loss of $0.54 per share. For the September quarter, losses came in at $0.10 per share compared with the Street's forecast of a loss of $0.33 per share.For the December ended quarter, Workday expects revenues of $219 million-$222 million compared with the Street's forecast of $220 million.Workday's Product ExpansionWorkday continues to grow product offerings and recently introduced Workday Insight Applications, a new suite of applications that will leverage advanced data science and machine learning algorithms to help customers with improved decision-making systems. The application will be able to provide customers with insight into making more informed financial and workforce decisions. The application will be made available to the public starting this year.They also introduced Composite Reporting as part of the latest release of Workday Financial Management. Composite Reporting is an advanced reporting tool that will cater to the reporting requirements of large organizations.Workday went public in 2012. Prior to listing, they had received $175 million in venture funding from investors including Janus Capital Group, T. Rowe Price, Morgan Stanley, Bezos Expeditions, Dave Duffield, Greylock Partners, New Enterprise Associates and IndoUS Venture Partners. They raised $637 million in their IPO and have seen valuations grow from $7.8 billion back in 2012 to nearly $15 billion this year. That is a rather high valuation for a company that is expected to end fiscal 2014 with revenues close to $780 million. It did not take very long for Workday to reach the multi-billion dollar valuation group. Back in 2011, six years after being founded, they had raised $85 million in a funding round that valued them at $2 billion.Their stock is trading at $79.42 with a market capitalization of $14.9 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $116.47 in March last year.According to a MarketAnalysis report, the global HR software market is expected to grow 2.4% annually over the period 2015 through 2020 to be worth $9.2 billion. The growth is projected to be primarily driven by increased adoption of SaaS-based delivery models. Workday is positioned well in this market. They have already attracted big customers to their services and recently saw PwC become the largest services partner for their products in Canada."
2839196,48411,2015-01-23T06:00:00-05:00,"WDAY has watched its share price fall 27% from a recent peak all the while having $1.83 billion in C&CE on its balance sheet.WDAY needs to get aggressive with acquisitions to accelerate revenue growth and to provide itself highly visible competitive advantages for its financial and analytical solutions.As frustrating as it is, continue to wait on WDAY shares.","Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY), the human capital management/analytics/financial management company, has to be one of the more frustrating companies I follow. I mean, it's so attractive and such a strong performer but capable of so much more. It's frustrating watching it just sort of trudge along down the path of greatness rather than run down it full speed. Frustrating, but what a beautiful frustration it is.Unfortunately, this half-speed evolution of the company is doing just enough to prop shares to levels where I can't initiate a position, but at the same time don't allow me to get excited enough about progress to buy in on the hopes of a trading range breakout. WDAY is stuck in limbo and it's been stuck there for a while now. Equally as unfortunate, that means I'm going to have to continue waiting on the sidelines at least another quarter longer:After peaking at ~$110 per share in calendar Q1/14 the company has watched its shares fall down to ~$80 per share as of late with the next level of support being another $10 (or 12.5%) lower. Its current trading price is $10 (11%) lower from where I initiated coverage of the name but decided to wait for either lower relative pricing (the company still trades at whopping 21X Price/Sales ratio) or for something to spur growth along - something like an acquisition.At 21X PSR you're going to be hard pressed to find another name in the HCM space of any size, and for that matter any other non-biotech sector name, that has so much forward success priced into shares. I've argued before that WDAY could very easily be worth its high multiple under the right circumstances and that the name isn't a short candidate at this point based on its vast potential - things like its developments in Europe, its growing financial and analytics solutions, its massive cash balance that could help the company get acquisition aggressive, etc. But at this point, I'm afraid that without doing something to project to the markets either a secondary market acquisition (maybe the top-end of the SMB space?) or some type of definitive competitive advantage from a solution standpoint other than pure size (and its size is definitely a competitive advantage provider) that institutions may be done buying shares in the short term. Without serious institutional enthusiasm I don't see shares breaking out of the range set at $95 and even worse I see a continuation of the share price trickle down.I think it's time WDAY gets serious about considering acquiring some growth and some R&D and makes better use of its huge cash balance. The question I think everybody wants answered at this point is: what are you waiting for, Workday?Another Great Quarter, Another Yawn By The MarketsWDAY posted another what has now come to be expected (as evidenced by the PSR) great quarter. Make no mistake about it, Q3 was a dandy. It had a little bit of everything but nothing really that said anything to the market other than the company is beginning to feel the weight of its huge revenue, and that it should soon follow the familiar downward slope line of growth that companies see as they mature. The bigger the comparable revenue print the harder it is to grow the next print - this is a pretty basic concept. Maybe that's the reason the market yawned at the quarterly update and why shares have been soft landing lower and lower. Regardless of the reason, the quarter was great and showed again a healthy company growing healthier.WDAY's balance sheet is the source of most of my frustration but not because it isn't rock solid; it is. What frustrates me is seeing that ~$1.83 billion in C&CE doing absolutely nothing. I hate that this amount of capital is parked on the balance sheet when at the very least it could be going to putting a dent into the ~$8 million quarterly and ~$22 million 9M interest expense by doing something accretive, like buying net income growth in the space or buying some topline growth in the space.I opined in my initiation article that WDAY should buy Paylocity (NASDAQ:PCTY) because of the synergies that can be realized. With management's directness on the Q3 conference call that they're committed to growing attach rates for the analytics and financial solutions, why not go out and acquire a Workiva (NYSE:WK) or a New Relic (NYSE:NEWR) and add some highly visible and synergistic competitive advantages to the overall WDAY product umbrella? I just don't get it. Again, what exactly is more attractive to WDAY about that amount of cash sitting on the balance sheet with more than manageable CAPEX and net cash outflows on the horizon for the next few years? Overall though, the balance sheet continues to look good and the potential for WDAY to do something with that C&CE should prevent shorting of the stock even at the current elevated PSR.The balance sheet is made to look even more egregious when you consider the overall cash flow situation at the company:WDAY has spent ~$100 million in CAPEX and other investment outflows during the reported 9M (non-direct investment related, meaning non-securities) and generated ~$53 million in operational cash inflows. That brings total cash outflows (non-direct investment related) to ~$47 million. That's it. What is ~$1.83 billion doing on the balance sheet?This has pretty much been the scenario for the last two years as well:This dynamic can be made more clear by taking a look at the convenient FCF graphic the company prepared for investors in its 10-Q:Can you start to see why I'm scratching my head with the shares falling 27% peak to current pricing? The trailing 12 month free cash flow figure is also evidence, as it should have been abundantly clear in the statement of cash flows above, that the FCF generation abilities of WDAY are growing by the quarter. I mean, at some point I'm going to have to just buy WDAY regardless of its slowing growth or unwillingness to spend its balance sheet C&CE because the cash flow it's going to throw off and at that point I'll stop complaining and writing articles but we're not there yet. For now, WDAY's biggest problem is that it has an embarrassment of riches. A good problem to have, yes, but this solving this problem could also solve the bigger problem of a devaluing common stock.As for WDAY's operations, of course those looked amazing as well because what else would you expect from this quality name:With a healthy schedule of customer launches and some operational leverage growth WDAY was able to significantly scale-down losses on the operational level and, on a non-GAAP basis, almost broke even in terms of core operating loss for the quarter. On a GAAP basis WDAY grew revenues 68% on the quarter and 71% on the 9M. This was on uber-conservative FFY15 guidance of 50%.For the record, WDAY is guiding its internal investment and hiring models on again uber-conservative ""40% growth"". Clearly, nobody is expecting that to be the actual rate of growth in FFY16. That being said, operating loss grew 27% on the quarter and 57% on the 9M which shows that GAAP expenses are still greatly outpacing revenues. Again, I reiterate this is all a part of 1) the model and 2) the 'land and expand' expectation. As said multiple times in the lead-up to this section WDAY had a blowout quarter and a better 9M that show that it is certainly aggregating the enterprise HCM space and is still the brand name in the space.Here are the non-GAAP figures I was referencing:Only backing out share based comp and ""other"" expenses which were minimal (~$1.5 million on the quarter and ~$4 million on the 9M) WDAY again almost hit breakeven on margin and operating loss on the quarter and made huge strides on both for the 9M. Management guided this should be positive on the quarter level at some point in mid-F2016 which would be a huge milestone for the company.Like I said in the beginning of this section, WDAY posted a blowout quarter and its revenue growth remains healthy. Yes, the rate of growth is slowing and The Street is having a problem with that but that's not as much my concern as the wasted opportunity to acquire market share and/or stickiness by deployed capital smartly. I have no concerns with WDAY's operations or its future viability, just its market cap and multiple under the current circumstances as a whole.Where's the trade?Ok, let's pull this all together.WDAY continues to be an excellent business that's becoming even more influential in the space. It's figuratively eating ADP's lunch (read: revenues) while making them do its homework (read: taking its customers after it proved the space and the need for a non-in house provider).WDAY continues to have a substantial amount of cash sitting on the balance sheet doing nothing while having an excellent cash flow dynamic, manageable expenses on the whole, and essentially zero long-term debt as all of its debt is convertible.Finally, WDAY's shares continue to be under pressure because 1) the market is considering the space's new competition coming from not just the HCM space (not direct competitors in the enterprise space but soon could be - PAYC, PCTY, TNET, etc.) but also the enterprise solutions space (too many to list); 2) the market is trying to figure out what is going to stop the normal downward slope line of rate of revenue growth from setting in; and 3) with WDAY having already invested money into its European operations should those have a slow start, the US business will be there to make up for any income statement stress.For now, I continue to recommend that readers wait on WDAY shares. There's no sense of urgency to buy because there's no sense of urgency from WDAY management to get aggressive.I continue to look forward to providing continuing coverage in the future. Good luck to all."
2597205,48411,2014-10-27T14:15:00-04:00,"WDAY, despite its income statement showing massive and growing net losses, is a healthy company with a healthy chart.
        WDAY is showing improving true and Core Operating margins (non-GAAP).
        WDAY should acquire an indirect competitor and establish itself even further as the juggernaut of the HCM space.","I've been interested in Workday, Inc. (NASDAQ:WDAY) since its well hyped, and well deserved of the hyping, IPO in October of 2012. I'm actually in love with the HCM space in general and cover with regularity two indirect HCM competitors of WDAY in Paycom Software and Paylocity - two companies I'm long and two companies that I think are the class of the niche from a growth perspective.I've never had a position in WDAY and don't plan to initiate one anytime soon but that's not an indictment on the company or on the company's prospects. It's more a function of the fact that the IPO came out of the gates to huge gains and have held those gains since inception, leaving little room to initiate a position at the bottom of risk managed trading range. It's been nothing but higher highs and higher lows since the IPO.That said, I still follow the name closely and should the right opportunity present itself or should WDAY decide to acquire the right company or transition to what I believe should be the company's stated growth strategy I would have no problem initiating a position in the name. I think there are things WDAY could be doing to accelerate growth and to further its defensiveness as the leader in the HCM space but I don't think WDAY is in any danger of seeing its share price lose any type of serious value and by way of that I certainly don't think WDAY is a short sale candidate.This article will discuss the excellent health of WDAY's operations - although to see this health some digging is required, the excellent cash flow generation of those operations and what that will mean for shareholders longer term, the above sector comparable strength of its balance sheet (especially when considering WDAY's considerable size), and provide a solution for WDAY to break out of the trading range it has been stuck in since late May and may be stuck in for quite a while to come.A Brief HistoryFor those unfamiliar with WDAY or the HCM (human capital management) space, WDAY provides solutions that help large enterprises manage payroll, financial management, time tracking, and employee expenses. WDAY also provides solutions that assist with general analytics (tailored to meet the need of the client although this is a small segment of what the company does as a whole). The HCM space has been disrupted in size the last few years with a handful of really evolutionary SAAS providers, WDAY being the largest, helping take market share from legacy, traditional HCM solutions providers like ADP.Now, WDAY's size has allowed it to enter into what is considered the major leagues of the space and that is the ""Tier-1"" or large enterprise arena. WDAY targets large companies that it can use to gain market share quickly and with some level of defensiveness once the client has been won. This has had a few very marked opposite end of the spectrum effects on WDAY's financials.First, it has created substantial historic revenue growth. WDAY's revenue grew 104% from FY12-FY13 and grew 71% from FY13-FY14. We're talking about a company that is generating nearly half a billion dollars in revenue at fiscal year-end 2014. These huge revenues in real dollars (meaning the actual volume of dollars rather than the revenues being measured on a percentage basis against other income statement line items) can and will have definitive effects on the lower lines of the income statement eventually however right now, as is natural with the HCM space and the subscription based models that are the norm for the space as well, expenses have greatly outpaced revenues. Net losses, inclusive of non-cash items like share based compensation and non-recurring items like debt issuance costs, have grown each year and have shown to be accelerating over the last two fiscal full years. This has led to what can be misconceived as a sickly looking set of operations:Notice the growing revenues here but also the massive net losses the company has taken on. This has left WDAY with an accumulated deficit as of 6/30/2014 of ~$702 million which is something that will take time to work through to a breakeven.WDAY's operating margins, which are probably more indicative of company health than any other readily calculated metric have also been historically bad because of the pay now but collect revenues over the course of a contract model being deployed:You can see that WDAY's true operating margins were as low as (43%) in fiscal full year 2013 and still a very poor (33%) at fiscal full year-end 2014. I'll discuss Core Operating Margin shortly but what should be taken from this graphic is that WDAY only showing these types of losses and negative margins because it uses a model in which it accounts for expenses as it incurs them and accounts for revenues ratably over the term of the subscription. Clearly, this puts a high level of risk on WDAY retaining customers but it also allows WDAY to drive customer acquisition cost to zero over time and it allows customers from periods past to cover the full cost of customers being acquired in present quarters at some point. For clarity, at some point of intercept WDAY's book will grow to a point where it is so large that the recurring revenues, which have already been expensed up front and are no longer showing an income statement contribution to expenses, will be able to offset matching expenses coming from newer client expenses.This will take place either when WDAY decides to proactively slow growth (for whatever reason - I wouldn't plan on this being the factor to drive the intercept point closer) or when WDAY's organic growth slows as a percentage of its existing revenues (read: the natural growth curve flattening out, it is showing to do this already). The point to be made here folks is that this model, as ugly as it looks in the early going, is well planned for long-term success and has the potential to drive margins theoretically to infinity. Clearly, this isn't going to happen but the model should keep margins extremely high once the book reaches a point of being weighted towards contracts that have made up acquisition costs. This is the bull case at WDAY and this is what you must be willing to accept as what excuses the net loss growth and the operating margin negativity.A Healthy Stock Reflective of a Healthy CompanyMore recently, we've seen more of the same from WDAY:You see the same high revenue growth rate coupled with the same high net loss growth rate. The model is showing that WDAY is still in land and expand mode and that profitability will not be had for quite some time.Margins however are showing that the underlying business, excluding share based comp and minimal other expenses but still inclusive of other non-cash items like D&A, is growing healthier by the period:I know that true operating margin decreased 300 basis points to (33%) from (30%) for the period being compared here but looking at the far left column and making the Adjustments outlined above you can see that Core Operating Margin negativity has been halved Y/Y. That is a huge improvement and is reflective of the shortened distance from profitability and the efficiency growth of each dollar being spent ex. share based comp and 100 basis point of Other Operating Expenses. This to me is an extremely bullish long term indicator that can be used in the short-term to calm the nerves of any fence sitting long. The company is improving in profitability on a deep under the surface level. The core operations are showing to be margin expansive.This becomes just as pronounced when looking at a six month comparable period:The six month comparison shows true operating margins held flat in the face of the scale up taking place and shows Core Operating Margins improved 1100 basis points. Again, this isn't even excluding all true non-cash and non-recurring items. I for one don't feel like the Core Operating Margins being reported are egregious or are indicative of anything other than what they represent. Bears may not like to use this metric for comparing period to period performance but the share price seems to agree with the company in that the story is no less bullish today than it was at the IPO. WDAY is making the under the surface improvements that it needs to in order to hold serve at the ~$85 it has traded at the last several months.Cash flows are also contributing the bull story at WDAY and go a long way into keeping the bears and the short selling sharks away:Historically WDAY has shown operational cash flow generation in both FY13 and FY14. This matters because once WDAY begins to slow or stop its CAPEX WDAY could be showing FCF generation. If WDAY can reach a point soon, and this isn't absolutely necessary considering the C&CE balance on the books currently, of FCF generation that would go a long way into being able to aggressively acquire smaller companies (considering the size of the cash flow from operations and the subsequent FCF) or avoid as large of financing as may have taken place (most likely in 36 months). Both scenarios are positive.The more recent statement of cash flows shows this same trend of improving cash flow generation Y/Y for the period being compared:Finally, being a technology company and being one that has made several acquisitions WDAY has a strong balance sheet that isn't heavily weighted to Goodwill or to other intangible assets. It also doesn't have a large weighting to P&PE. This should keep the possibility of Goodwill impairments low and D&A expense growth low. Once final item to note is the C&CE balance mentioned above:All told WDAY is a very healthy company with a healthy set of operations. The current state of both appears to be well priced into the shares with the market trapping WDAY shares in its current range and keeping it there for several months now. So, how does WDAY breakout? I'll offer a solution.Breaking the RangeI read an article in Forbes this morning about IBM and the struggles that it's being exposed for having as a result of it not being innovative and as a result of its being too scared to upset the natural order of its expense accounting. Meaning it was afraid to spend for growth or market share and the cumulative effects of this have finally caught up. I'm no IBM expert so forgive my too concise explanation of the article.I bring this up because I couldn't help but think of WDAY and the run it has had since late 2012. WDAY is a sense is the IBM of the HCM space currently in that it's the brand name that large enterprises know they can turn to for reliable services. The market has accordingly priced this into the shares and WDAY's $8.85 billion valuation.Now, before moving to a higher range I think the market is looking for several benchmarks to be hit:I think WDAY should take the anti-IBM approach and make a large acquisition as its just far enough from its contractual obligations coming due in size (and whatever can kicking will take place at that time) and as it has a good portion of C&CE available to use as the cash portion of the acquisition. I think WDAY should and could secure a worthy LOC (probably between $100 and $300 million) and should use a revolver to finance operations in the interim post acquisition.I think it would make a lot of sense for WDAY to acquire Paylocity Holding Corp. (NASDAQ:PCTY) in that:Obviously this is complete speculation but I think it makes sense and I think it would be a major power move from WDAY. I really hope to see some type of development like this in the near term.Where's the trade?As I said in the beginning, I'm going to wait this out either until WDAY falls underneath the current range and I can initiate a position with some value or until WDAY meets any of those benchmarks outlined. I'm not writing this article to make a claim that WDAY is undervalued, I don't think it is, but I am expressing my thoughts that I don't think WDAY should be shorted. If you're looking for gains on the short side I think there are plenty of more attractive options outside of this company.WDAY is a healthy company that has hit the share price growth wall but it's a healthy company none the less. Congrats to those who have been long for any portion of the current run.I look forward to providing continuing coverage in the future. Good luck to all."
2724085,70615,2014-12-02T08:30:33-05:00,"The company can under-deliver with its new applications for workplace management.Missing potential growth targets could spell disaster for Workday.Any security breach for the company will put it in a much weaker position against the competition.On the positive note, the company has managed to acquire a number of large clients.New deployment partnerships could help Workday slowly regain its previous growth levels.","Since its public offering in 2012, Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) stock climbed more than 100%, from its $50 beginning to the high of $115. Workday's growth was spurred by the belief in the strength of its enterprise resource planning software, which would allow the company to achieve rapid and sustained growth. Since its highest peak, the stock nearly halved in value, and is currently trading in the $79 range. There are a number of threats and opportunities for the company, however, and of course there is no certainty as to what the future might hold for its investors.New Apps Could Under-DeliverSo far, Workday has done exceptional job in building cloud-based enterprise resource planning software that integrates with its other offerings. Currently, the company is in the process of building new applications for managing the workplace, while pushing into completely new environment. The new application suite will be doing the task of supplying businesses with predictive data and recommendations for management, and would also be able to map out employee performance analysis, career path suggestions and more. While there is great potential for the new apps, if the company does not perform up to standard, the result could be a further decline for Workday's stock. There are also a number of competing companies in the same industry of predictive management solutions, which could make it difficult for Workday to stand out in the crowd.Missing Growth TargetsThe company's stock is currently price at 22.4 times trailing 12-month sales, with it being heavily dependent on revenue growth and expectations. While Workday did manage to build sales over the past couple of years, the total expenditures have also risen due to the acquisitions and expansion costs.The company's data demonstrated growth rate for costs to be slower than for revenue; however, the fact that Workday's share price has increased relative to sales growth may conclude that the company may be overvalued. This is why any sort of earnings misses or downward target revisions may be detrimental to the share price.Possible Security BreachesThe cloud-based ERP software usually lets business stress less about maintenance and product replacement; however, it can also make crucial information less secure. According to SafeNet, cloud data breaches accounted for more than 20% of all breaches in the third quarter of 2014, with storage security becoming the main concern.If at some point Workday experiences a security breach, there will be an enormous impact on the company's valuation. Although Workday does have some significant advantages over its competitors, such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), in terms of cloud-based offerings, these companies still manage to provide quick solutions which are no match for Workday. Even worse, the breach would not actually need to happen on Workday's network in order to have great impact on the stock. Similar hacks in the same industry could spell a disaster for the company's stock, due to its current fragile position.Possible New Large CustomersOn a positive note, there are still factors in play that could help the company recover from the recent decline. One of them is the possibility of acquiring new large clients, which will represent a major growth driver for the company in the future. While Workday has found success with the mid-sized companies, it now plans to move upmarket. In the previous quarter, Workday was able to secure Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) as a customer, which is the largest deal for the software maker to-date. Workday was also able to add another large customer, who is currently unknown. The acquisitions of large clients will be a great growth booster for the company, especially if the new customers subscribe to all enterprise software suites.On October 8, the company also announced that TalkTalk Telecom Group (OTCPK:TLKTF), a British telecom company with a market cap of $4 billion, had signed to Workday's service. Although that deals did not produce a share price spike, it can be expected that more significant foreign signings would have a more powerful effect on valuation. If Workday is also able to boost its government and education segments, then it can expect great growth in the future.New Deployment PartnershipsWorkday has been able to make advancements in the deployment of major partnerships with Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC). These represent the most positive news for the company in the last year. As the company is looking to move further into upmarket, it will be aiming for more large clients to serve as deployment partners. This particular strategy will allow Workday to reach more customers through the more reputable direct clients, which will allow the company to decrease the costs associated with acquiring new subscribers.Final ThoughtsCurrently, Workday's stock price is largely reliant on the business's ability to grow. As seen, there are valid reasons to be skeptical about the stock, such as the strong competition and fears of a future bearish market. Although there is no certainty that the company cannot provide wins for bullish shareholders, at the current point, investors would be wiser to stay on the sidelines until the stock produces new highs."
2570535,73565,2014-10-17T11:55:42-04:00,,"This post is part of a continuing series evaluating the S-1s of publicly traded SaaS companies in order to better understand the core business and build a library of benchmarks that might be useful to founders.Today, we'll explore one of the enterprise behemoths, both in market cap and average revenue per customer: WorkDay (NASDAQ:WDAY). WorkDay envisions being the place of record for all Human Resources data for companies with more than 5,000 employees. WorkDay has grown explosively, but in a very different manner than any of the previous companies we've analyzed (Veeva (NYSE:VEEV), Hubspot (NYSE:HUBS), Zendesk (NYSE:ZEN), Tableau (NYSE:DATA), MobileIron (NASDAQ:MOBL) or Box (NYSE:BOX)). Unlike these other companies, WorkDay has employed a huge professional services team in addition in investing massively in R&D to create a broad suite of products.Just how significant is the professional services component to WorkDay's business? In 2009 and 2010, the company recognized more revenue from services than subscriptions. Over time, that figure has fallen, but it far surpasses any of the SaaS companies we've analyzed to date. In 2011, the year of the IPO, services still accounted for 33% of revenues.Over time, subscription revenue will continue to increase compared to services revenue. WorkDay deploys its professional services teams at the outset of a customer's engagement with WorkDay when all the systems integration and data processing must be completed. It's a critical component to customer success. But this involvement decreases with time and tends to be episodic, as does the revenue WorkDay generates from it.In contrast, WorkDay typically signs 3-5 subscription year agreements, so the subscription revenue is a substantial annuity of long duration.Nevertheless, Services revenue will be a significant contributor to revenue for the foreseeable future, because new accounts are the biggest driver for revenue growth, according to the S-1.Over the past decade, software companies have been advised to limit their services revenue to typically less than 20% of total revenues, which WorkDay has ignored to its great success.Behind this advice is some sage advice, however. Services revenue isn't a money-maker. WorkDay has operated its Services group at a loss or close to break-even for the three years we have data. The chart above shows these trends and compares it to the Subscription gross margin which has increased by 50%, reaching 75% in 2011, in the same time period. Selling people's time can't be leveraged like software.In addition to developing the flagship Human Capital Management application, WorkDay has been building a suite of complementary tools including Financial Management, Procurement and Expenses, Payroll, and Talent Management at the pace of about one product per year.To achieve this enormous product breadth, WorkDay spent an astounding 119% of revenue on R&D, more than any other SaaS company at their stage. In dollars, WorkDay has $30M on research and development on revenues of $25.2M in 2009.WorkDay financed this huge investment by coupling long-term, near-million-dollar agreements and nearly $200M in venture capital.The sum total of all this investment in engineering and professional services enabled by big contracts and venture capital is immense revenue growth, more than tripling revenues in just two years, in addition to more than $150M in deferred revenue.WorkDay reached $50M just five years after founding, tying it for third fastest to $50M among the public SaaS companies in this bucket.With only 325 customers at IPO, WorkDay's revenues are driven by a $500k+ Average Revenue per Customer, second only to Veeva. This figure includes both subscription and service, but is annualized, so the total contract values (TCV) are substantially larger, at least 3-5x.Despite that huge revenue growth, WorkDay has the median amount on sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue.And WorkDay's sales efficiency also is at or better than the median, likely because the contract sizes are so large, they support significant investment in sales and marketing.Because of all the R&D spend, WorkDay's net income percentage is substantially lower than the median. But because the company has such a huge amount of deferred revenue, the possibility of cross-selling the product suite and lengthy customer lifetimes, it's easy to justify this continued spend.WorkDay has built a business in a very different manner than most SaaS companies, leveraging large contracts, massive R&D spend and substantial professional services engagements to generate massive revenue growth and create the next monolithic enterprise company."

It divides opinions.My opinion is that Workday is over-valuated, and can even be unable to ever present GAAP profits.This article discusses some indicators that justify why I think Workday is a better short than long position.","I have been following Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) since its recent (2012) IPO.WDAY is a well-known cloud/SaaS company that has been presenting fast growth. Since it was created in 2005, it is still a relatively recent company. However, after 9 years of operation, and having already reached a market capitalization of around $17 billion, it must be considered to be well beyond the start-up phase. This is where things get interesting, since WDAY has still to make the transition from a ""loss-incurring pure-growth phase"" into profitability.In spite of a serious correction in early 2014, the relatively consistent increase of the price of WDAY shares since its IPO (presented in the chart below) shows that, in general, most investors believe in its business model and are comfortable with its evolution.This is so mainly because those investors believe in the quality of WDAY products offer and, most of all, are quite happy with the rate of growth of its revenues. They reason that on that basis, WDAY will soon make the transition into profits, and then, due to the miracle of the SaaS business (and billing) model, sky will be the limit. Good examples of this extremely positive view can be found in these recent Seeking Alpha articles: Is It Time To Buy Workday Shares? and Salesforce.com Moving Out Of The Clouds.Naturally, since WDAY never presented profits (and, in fact, its losses are growing on a par with its revenue), and since it already reached a market valuation that discounts strong profitability going forward (something that it may never achieve), there are also a number of analysts and investors with a negative view of this company. Some recent articles in Seeking Alpha present the reasoning for this negative view. Good examples include: Danger Zone: Workday, A Hitchhiker's Guide To A Reflating Tech Bubble: Short Workday and Lofty Valuation And Substantial Stock-Based Compensation Bode Poorly For Workday.I'm also in this second group. I believe that WDAY is not only grossly over-valuated, but also that it will have great difficulty to even make the transition from losses into marginal profits. As such, I'm short WDAY. In the present article, I will present some very specific indicators that justify this point of view.When I study a company that seems worth of investment (long or short), I develop a spreadsheet with a number of fundamental indicators, so as to easily evaluate their evolution through time.The following table is a much simplified version of that table for WDAY. This summary table focuses on the quarterly evolution of the main indicators I want to discuss in this article. Note that WDAY only presents publicly available quarterly data starting in 2012.So, let's cover those main indicators.1. Evolution of the revenues:There is not much to say about revenue growth. It is WDAY's strength. Every reason to invest in WDAY that I could find in the articles I read revolves around its strong revenue growth. Some try to explain that growth on the basis of WDAY's wonderful set of products/services, most argue that growth can be maintained for a long time at present rates, and that translating the resulting extremely high future revenue into (very high) profits will be simple, almost automatic.2. Evolution of the net income:Unfortunately for this bullish thesis, no company can achieve revenue without costs. WDAY has the expected cost structure of a company involved in the ""cloud industry"": Software/services development, selling costs, administrative expenses, continued acquisitions of niche smaller competitors, etc.In WDAY's case, even after 9 years of product development and selling experience and streamlining, even with its wonderful, superior product offering (that should attract clients without much effort), the aggregate of those costs remains vastly superior to each quarter's revenue. That results in continued net losses.The continued losses do not discourage the longs. For them, selling costs will be reduced when WDAY so desires, and the already acquired clients will remain faithful (without further costs) due to the superiority of WDAY's products and due to simple inertia: If they already use a cloud services company, why change?However, this reasoning fails to explain WDAY's very constant proportion between revenues and costs. If this were true (and I can think of many fundamental arguments to drill holes in the thesis, but now we are dealing with cold factual numbers, not ethereal ideas), WDAY should already have a strong basis on previous clients that should not present renewed costs to maintain. Thus, through time, its costs should be getting lower in relation to the revenue. But that is not happening!For WDAY, quarter after quarter, the overall costs keep exceeding the revenues by an uncannily stable margin of around 37%. Naturally, if the overall costs are superior to the revenues, this produces a net loss. That net loss, for WDAY, is an almost fixed relation of the revenues. (See the table, in particular, the relationship ""Net income/Revenue"".)3. Evolution of share-based compensation:Most of the companies that are involved in the cloud story use (and abuse) the concept of share-based compensation. They are growing, they have high personnel costs; they don't have infinite cash, they pay their best personnel with fresh company stock, thus saving cash. Naturally, for a company that presents profits, that is a problem for shareholders, since it represents a continuous increase of emitted shares, and so dilutes continuously their proportion of the company. But for companies that continue to present GAAP losses, however, this is ""anti-dilutive"" - a wonderful concept that can arguably be attributed to Marc Benioff, and that means that if a loss-making company doubles its shares, the loss per share will be reduced to half... Good for them!Some WDAY pears use this share-based compensation gimmick to replace GAAP losses for non-GAAP profits (CRM is probably the best-known example of this). But not WDAY: It remains faithful to losses, even in non-GAAP metrics, even after share-based compensation. However, that may change. WDAY's share-based compensation is positively exploding (talk about a hockey stick!). The table above shows that share-based compensation evolved from just 2% of revenues in the first quarter of 2012 to a whopping 22% (just in) the second quarter of 2014!If WDAY's share-based compensation keeps growing at the present rate, it should surpass net losses in 2 or 3 quarters, and from that moment on, WDAY will be able to present non-GAAP profits!(Again, good for them! That will be ""anti-dilutive"" for WDAY's happy shareholders!)Conclusions:Much more could be constructed from WDAY's fundamental numbers. One of the best examples would be to discuss the profits WDAY would have to reach to justify the present marker capitalization. Also, this article could present nice charts to illustrate the evolution of the above indicators (and several other). But let's keep things simple. Investors are smart, educated persons. Most will be able to reach proper conclusions if given the leads.Of course, besides individual investors (that can, and usually do, study the companies they invest in, and then discriminate between them), there are the investment funds that must simply be long (in the ""right"" proportion, usually based simply on market capitalization) in all the companies that belong to some class of companies where (by charter) they must be fully invested. These investment funds, most of them ETF, include broad market trackers, sectoral trackers, momentum (growth) trackers, etc. Most of these funds don't attempt to conduct in-depth fundamental analysis of the companies where they invest. Many of them don't discriminate between companies that are cheap or expensive, or even between those that present profits or losses. And unfortunately, these ""blind"" mechanical tracking funds now represent most of the capital invested in the stock markets. This phenomenon (relatively recent, at least with the present intensity) tends to prevent efficient market corrections to the prices of specific companies unworthy of their stock valuations, thus increasing the success of strategies such as extremely high stock-based compensation schemes.But that is another story. These are the markets we have at present, and we must be able to deal with them.Final cautionary note:I believe short positions should only be opened with extreme care.They should either be:"
2543245,52012,2014-10-07T12:41:42-04:00,"Bulls argue that WDAY deserves higher valuations due to unaccounted for backlog.
        Yet comparable price to sales metrics derived from company buyouts also include backlog from long term subscription contracts.
        Moreover SAP's recent purchase of CNQR corroborates the price to sales metric used to value WDAY.
        WDAY warrants a price target of <$40.","Previously I'd laid out a short case on Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) arguing that its stratospheric valuation and its increasing use of stock-based compensation makes it a compelling short. Subsequently another author pointed out WDAY's steady ratio of net income losses to revenue (among other items) as being bearish for the stock. One common bullish response to these valuation concerns suggests that because WDAY has long term contracts - which aren't fully reflected in the GAAP financials - the valuation measures fall short. This is a plausible argument which I'd like to examine in the following article. In so doing I'll also look at a new data point which comes from SAP's recent buyout of Concur Technologies (NASDAQ:CNQR).The ArgumentThe basic bullish argument is that WDAY sells three year contracts, but they only book a year of those at a time (the invoiced year shows up on the balance sheet as unearned revenue which is then recognized ratably over the next year.) Any contractual amounts that haven't been invoiced aren't reflected in the financials, yet due to the non-cancellable contracts, they are genuine backlog. Moreover this backlog represents future revenue which will require lower sales and marketing expenses than would new customers.Here's the language WDAY uses to explain how it books subscription revenue:Now personally I'm surprised that WDAY doesn't provide supplementary info in its 10-Q's and 10-K's regarding longer term backlog, particularly since presumably it's positive (?), but for whatever reason they don't.We can see the trend of annual revenue vs. current deferred revenue in the chart below. The argument is that non-current revenue is largely understated due to the company's revenue recognition policies. (Indeed the non-current deferred revenue is likely larger than the current deferred revenue.)WDAY Non-Current Deferred Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsSo the question now is how do we handicap WDAY's price to sales metrics given that they operate with three year contracts and that anything beyond a year of the contract's remaining life isn't accounted for?ResponseCertainly the steadiness of revenue, and the accrued future revenue with lower sales and marketing costs is a positive and anything I say below doesn't take away from that. The question is only, how much does one pay for this positive?In answering the bull's objection, the main point is to recognize that the use of 3 year contracts isn't exclusive to WDAY. In my previous article I'd mentioned the buyouts of Taleo and SuccessFactors as comparables from which we could benchmark metrics for WDAY's valuation. Both of those companies also had longer term contracts, so the fact that WDAY operates with 3 year contracts in no way diminishes the usefulness of the Taleo and SuccessFactors buyouts as comparables. Here are the specifics from each company for comparison:From Taleo's last SEC 10-KFrom SuccessFactors last SEC 10-K:Recall that Taleo was bought out at 6X sales, while SuccessFactors was bought at 10X sales. Given their long term contracts and revenue recognition policies, these are metrics that should be directly comparable to WDAY. Yet currently WDAY trades around 25X sales.Moreover, even for companies who don't have longer term contracts, the costs to retain a customer are normally significantly lower than those to obtain a new one. Over the longer term the risks of churn exist for companies using either type of contract. One factor here is that when customers are faced with renewing for a three or five year period rather than annually or even monthly, they put much more time and due diligence into the decision. Thus churn for any company over time will boil down to the product and value proposition that it delivers, not to the fact that it has longer or shorter term contracts.Finally, recent events give us another way to vet our price to sales multiple.An Additional Data PointOn September 18, SAP bought another publicly traded cloud computing company, Concur Technologies . Though it doesn't have the same growth rate as WDAY, it's still interesting to see what SAP paid. Here's a snapshot of CNQR's valuation metrics at the buyout price (all stats are from yahoo!):And here are analyst estimates (snapshot also taken on Sep 26, 2014):Thus for a company that's expected to be marginally profitable in 2015, SAP was willing to pay 11X sales. That this was probably too high is suggested by SAP's price fall subsequent to the purchase:So once again, anything above a P/S multiple of 11 would seem an excessive valuation and personally I'd lower this multiple for a company showing perennial losses, no signs of improved profitability and an increased penchant for issuing shares via stock-based compensation.For reference, here are WDAY's current valuation statistics:Accordingly, if WDAY were to trade at an 11X P/S multiple it would be priced at $37; if it traded at 6X sales, its price would be $20. As a result I remain short with a longer term target of <$40. (Note too that a $40 price would still be a nice gain from WDAY's $28 IPO price - and would suggest that the IPO pricing was realistic as compared to today's stratospheric valuation.)"

According to IDC, the market grew 9.1% in 2013 to $10.4 billion, and the momentum is expected to continue going forward. IDC forecasts that the market will grow at a CAGR of 8.2% till 2018, hitting a size of $15.4 billion.As such, it is not surprising that cloud player Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), which specializes in HCM, is growing at a good pace. In the recently-reported second-quarter, Workday delivered a substantial increase in its revenue year over year. Its numbers were better than Street expectations, leading to a sharp rise in the shares, and the company also raised its full-year revenue forecast.In fact, Workday reported a 74% year-over-year rise in its revenue to $186.8 million, which topped analysts' expectations of $177.3 million. Revenue generated from the number of subscriptions rose 77% year over year to $143.7 million. But, this growth came at a price, as the total cost was more than its revenue, and increased 78% from a year ago period to $248 million. However, the company managed to reduce its net loss per share to $0.11 from $0.13 last year, and marginally outperformed the consensus estimate of $0.14.More expenses aheadHCM is a competitive space, with companies like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) also operating in this market. As such, it is important for Workday to make aggressive investments in order to stay ahead of the competition, and it is doing just that. However, this has led to increased costs, but at the same time, the company is seeing strong growth in its customers.To sustain its impressive revenue growth, Workday will continue investing in the business aggressively. It has outlined an investment plan of $100 million-$110 million in capital expenses during fiscal 2015. But, these investments will raise the total cost for the company. Most of its expenses have increased year on year, such as general and administrative expenses, sales and marketing expenses, and product development, among others.As a result, management does not expect GAAP profits at least by the next fiscal. Although this does not come as a surprise, as analysts were expecting the same, but this does indicate that Workday will continue to invest rapidly to improve its top line at a rapid pace, while profitability will take a back seat for the time being.Why investors shouldn't worryHowever, since Workday has a decent balance sheet, it has the flexibility of investing in growth. The company has cash of $1.82 billion on the balance sheet, and its debt is $485 million. In addition, Workday has got strong liquidity, as seen by a current ratio of 4.05. The company is also cash flow positive, generating $54 million in operating cash over the past year, while levered free cash flow stands at $106 million.Moreover, it is expected that Workday's bottom line will improve at a rapid pace in the future, and it will ultimately become profitable. According to estimates, Workday's bottom line is expected to improve at an annual rate of 42% over the next five years, double of the industry average. Hence, investors will need to hold the stock for the long run in order to see profitability. But, the good thing is that its investments are reaping results, as Workday has a solid customer base.Investments are driving more customersWorkday, which makes software for human resources and financial management, has built up a strong portfolio of customers, and anticipates the momentum to continue going forward. Last quarter, its customers in HCM crossed the 700 mark. In addition, the company is also focusing on diversification, and it is close to signing up a total of 100 customers for its financial management application.Hence, Workday is making good progress in new customer acquisitions. In fact, it landed Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) as a client last quarter, among others, which is its largest customer till date. Workday is also making significant strides in Europe, with a number of new global customers adding strength to its business. Further, to support its expanding customer base in Europe, Workday is adding local employees, and this is another reason behind its increasing costs.Apart from new customers, Workday is proceeding well with its existing customer base. According to statistics, at the end of the second quarter, more than two-thirds of its total customer base was live and used the same version, Workday 23. Moreover, its existing customers, such as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), are doing their bit in expanding Workday's business. According to a report:With this move, Workday will be able to sell its products to HP's customers.ConclusionThe HCM space is expected to grow at a decent pace going forward as seen above. As a result, Workday seems to be doing the right thing by investing more in customer acquisition initiatives. Though its bottom line will remain under pressure as a result of such investments, things are expected to improve in the long run. Hence, investors should continue holding Workday in their portfolios as it looks primed to deliver good gains in the long run on the back of industry growth and customer acquisitions."

        SaaS customers ‘‘rent’’ their software since they sign up to use it on an ongoing basis and pay as they go. Revenue for a SaaS company comes in gradually.
        At the current rate, Workday will, therefore, eventually realize revenue of $6.30 for every $1 it spends to acquire customers.","Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is the fastest growing public SaaS company today. Workday shares, together with those of leading SaaS companies, have sold off heavily this year mainly due to valuation concerns. Workday shares sport a price-to-sales ratio of about 30, compared to 9.3 for Cornerstone OnDemand and 13.9 for NetSuite.Despite its stratospheric valuation, Workday is a good long-term investment. Given its robust revenue growth, it will only take about 6 quarters for the valuation to be in line with its peers in the industry, assuming the price remains unchanged over that period of time.High marketing expensesA major characteristic of many SaaS companies is that most sport unusually high marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue, which makes it hard for them to turn a profit. Splunk's sales and marketing expenses currently sit north of 70% of its revenue, Salesforce's clocks in at 53%, while Workday's comes in at 42% of revenue.Major difference between SaaS and traditional software companiesThe core business models of traditional software companies such as SAP and Oracle centers around selling a perpetual license for their software, and then selling upgrades later. Customers pay a license fee upfront, and a recurring maintenance fee about once every year (roughly 15%-20% of the license fee). Traditional software companies are lucky because the timing of their revenue inflows and expenses tend to be almost perfectly aligned. SaaS companies like Workday are not so lucky. SaaS customers ''rent'' their software since they sign up to use it on an ongoing basis and pay as they go. Revenue for a SaaS company comes in gradually as the months roll on. Yet the company incurs all costs, especially customer acquisition costs, upfront. Thus the timing of income and expenses tends to be misaligned. Bearing this in mind, to get a more accurate idea of Workday's true state of business, we would have to look at its deferred income. A good proxy that we can use here is the company's billings, which is usually calculated by taking the revenue of one quarter and then adding the change in deferred revenue between the current quarter and the previous quarter. Workday invoices customers for cloud application contracts using annual and multi-annual installments.Source: Workday 10-KsIn the current fiscal year, Workday billings exceed revenue by $128 million. Workday's billings in fiscal 2014 have been growing at a healthy pace of approximately 60%. This suggests that the company still has plenty of growth potential as it continues to win even more market share. That is perhaps the biggest reason why investors are willing to pay a big premium for the shares.Spending heavily on sales and marketing expensesSaaS companies such spend heavily on sales and marketing, as well as customer management functions because they know once a SaaS company has generated enough cash from its installed customer base to cover the cost of acquiring new customers, these customers tend to stay for long. SaaS businesses are sticky by nature because customers essentially outsource running of the software to the vendors which makes it easy to model and very likely to yield high cash flows.Once a SaaS business matures and all the costs of customer acquisitions were incurred upfront and charged to the balance sheet long ago, the company can now sit back comfortably and harvest most of the incoming cash flow as profits.To get an idea of how much Workdays spends on customer acquisition costs, we take its quarterly sales and marketing expenses and divide it by the number of customers it acquired during the quarter.We also need to know the quality of customers that the company is getting onboard because the higher the customer quality, the more money that the company can earn from them. The amount of revenue that can be realized from a customer is known as the customer lifetime value. Ideally, a SaaS company should have a customer lifetime value not less than three times the customer acquisition cost.Workdays does not typically disclose its customer lifetime value, so we work on the assumption that the company spends 70% of its sales and marketing expenses on customer acquisition costs.Workdays also does not also disclose its customer lifetime value, as well as its annual recurring revenue or contract value. We can therefore use the average subscription revenue per customer as a good proxy.Source: Workday 10-KsAt the current rate, Workday will, therefore, eventually realize revenue of $6.30 for every $1 it spends to acquire customers. Moreover, this figure is growing rapidly, which is good. The absolute amount that Workday spends on sales and marketing might be large, and is partly to blame for its continued losses, but it's money well spent, and will eventually start paying off before long.Bottom lineWorkday is spending lots of money on sales and marketing expenses, but the money is well spent, and will eventually start paying off in the form of profits for the company. The company also has a big backlog of business, which is a good sign of rapid growth. Workday shares, therefore, are good long-term investments. Investors can use the selloff to gain fresh entry points."
2248903,20521,2014-06-02T13:23:21-04:00,,"According to an IDC report released last year, the worldwide Human Capital Management (NASDAQ:HCM) market was pegged to be worth $7.5 billion in 2011. IDC estimates that HCM will grow annually at 8.1% over the next five years through 2016. The growth in the market is expected to be driven by the increasing adoption of cloud-based services.Workday's Financials Workday's (NASDAQ:WDAY) first quarter revenues grew 74% over the year to $159.7 million with an EPS of $0.13. The market was projecting revenues of $152.4 million with a loss of $0.15 per share. By segment, subscription revenues grew 80% over the year to $123.41 million. Professional services grew 56% over the year to $36.33 million.Workday's profits still remain distant as they continue to invest in product development and sales and marketing. During the last quarter, product development expenses grew 80% to $65 million and sales and marketing costs were up 78% to $68 million.For the current quarter, Workday projected revenues of $173 million-$178 million, compared with the Street's projections of $171.3 million. They projected current year with revenues of $730 million-$750 million, ahead of the market's target of $735.4 million.Workday's Product Upgrade Workday continued to enhance their product offerings for the market. During the recent quarter, they announced the availability of recruiting solution Workday Recruiting. Workday Recruiting is a comprehensive application that extends Workday's core Human Capital Management to include recruitment services. Workday Recruiting is being hailed as a disruptive force in the SaaS-based recruitment solutions. It focuses on collaboration between hiring teams including hiring managers, recruiters, and interview team members. Workday claims that the biggest selling feature of the product is in its ability to help recruiting teams select from internal as well as external candidates. The application is customizable to meet an organization's needs and includes features such as integration of social networks, mobile device compatibility, and a simplified job application process.Workday is targeting the corporate recruiting software segment, which analysts peg as a market worth $1.5 billion. Bigger companies like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) have already made their big moves in the segment. Oracle has a defined HCM practice that was strengthened with the acquisition of Taleo and SAP added SuccessFactors to build their recruiting and HR offering. IDC researchers estimate the HCM market to be worth $9 billion in 2013 in which SAP and Oracle had a combined 39% market share. Comparatively, Workday is much smaller with a mere 1% market share. However, with impressive product upgrades, Workday will surely give these giants tough competition. Workday's Recruiting offerings has already got strong reviews and has enlisted 70 organizations as its customers.Meanwhile, they also upgraded their existing product with the release of Workday 22. The new suite includes an additional 347 new features for both HR and Financial management that will help enhance the way organizations manage talent, customer accounts, spend, and expenses by giving them more visibility into these areas.Their stock is trading at $84.04 with a market capitalization of $15.46 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $116.47 in March this year."

Revenues came in ahead of consensus estimates at $152.4 million.Despite the aggressive top-line growth, net losses were on the rise as well. Net losses increased by 80% to $59.4 million, resulting in GAAP losses of $0.32 per share which compares to losses of $0.20 per share.Based on often looked at non-GAAP earnings metrics, losses came in at $0.13 per share. This was two cents better than the loss reported last year as well as analysts estimates.Looking Into The PerformanceGrowth in the quarter was driven by subscription revenues which were up by 80% to $123.4 million. Professional service revenues rose by 56% to $36.3 million.Direct costs of subscription services fell by 440 basis points to 17.4% of sales. To take notice of, direct costs of its professional service business rose to 99.0% of revenues, up from 93.7% reported last year.The company continues to show an increase in costs on the operational side, although the company saw modest operating leverage in percentage terms. Operating losses came in at 32.6% of sales on a GAAP basis, a 330 basis points improvement compared to last year.Despite the losses, the company actually took a very modest tax provision for its income taxes which implies that net earnings are not ¨inflated¨ throughout tax provision allowances.Looking Into The YearBased on solid first quarter performance, Workday now anticipates second quarter revenues of $173 to $178 million, which represents 61 to 65% annual growth. The guidance is above consensus estimates at $171.3 million.Full year revenues are now seen between $730 and $750 million which implies 56 to 60% growth on an annual basis. Total billings are anticipated at $890 to $910 million which adds to the future backlog.Rock Solid Balance SheetFollowing its public offering and the subsequent secondary offering, Workday holds $1.88 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company holds no conventional debt although it does have $474 million in convertible notes outstanding plus a modest amount of capital lease obligations, resulting in a net cash position of $1.4 billion.At $87 per share, the company is valued at $15.9 billion based on 183 million shares outstanding. This values operating assets at around $14.5 billion which on its turn values the company at 20 times projected revenues for this year.Investment TakeawayInvestors should note that Workday appears to be traditionally cautious in its guidance, to report a beat when announcing the definitive results.As the company offers its services on a SaaS-based business model, this means that revenues are only recognized on a monthly basis and not upfront in an accounting method which understates current revenues when you are growing. To indicate the growing pipeline of future revenues, Workday reported billings of $208 million for the quarter which implies billings run 30% above reported revenues. For the full year this gap is anticipated to come in at 22%.After strong momentum last year and at the start of the year, shares of Workday have given up some 45% from their highs of $115 in the wake of its fourth quarter release. Shares fell to lows of $65 amidst the momentum sell-off over the past quarter. Shares have bounced back up by a third to $87 at the moment of writing, but remain 25% below their highs.While I continue to appreciate the company's great applications and products, the valuation remains out of control in my opinion at 20 times forward revenues and 16 times forward billings. I won't even start discussing the growing GAAP losses.I continue to trade Workday from the short side.Disclosure: I am short WDAY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

They're different from the cloud enabling technologies of IaaS and PaaS. They're different from running office applications that save to a large data center.We're talking here of native applications that address the cloud as a single computer, and use the data large companies have stored there to make change happen in real time.Workday itself is an example of such an application. It's not just a storage system for resumes to be used by a single department. Workday is evolving Human Resources Management into a tool that can be used to create teams of compatible people, evaluate the availability of skills and salaries that should thus be offered, and that can drive the way the company is organized.Salesforce's ""secret sauce"" is its AppExchange, which takes clients well behind customer relations management and lets them run their whole company off Salesforce, just as other companies run on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).Salesforce's success has been a great mystery to some analysts, because it doesn't deliver the full economic benefits of cloud, running instead on proprietary servers from Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Oracle databases. What the company has done, instead, is turn its software into the heart of a large ecosystem, more like Microsoft Windows or Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) OSX than a database. This is giving it an extraordinary growth rate - $3.6 billion in revenue for its first three quarters against $4 billion for all of last year, which makes the stock attractive despite a general lack of profits.The story at Workday is similar, only more so. Quarterly sales are up 16%, after raises of 10%, 11% and 16% for the previous quarters, so that losses that are actually accelerating - $69 million lost on $187 million in sales for the latest quarter - don't disturb investors, who point to a relatively low debt-to-assets ratio of 25% and an asset base that's growing exponentially to support their choice.The problem here is obvious. These are growth stocks, mini-Amazons (NASDAQ:AMZN) if you will, and when growth goes out of fashion - as it has recently - they can't move forward. Both stocks are up over the last month by about 8%, but down substantially over the last six months and close to flat for the year to date. They're stocks you trade, momentum stocks, not true investments, unless you think Mr. Toad's Wild Ride was a good investment.You can also see this in Workday's latest earnings release, which came out on Wednesday. Subscription revenue was up 77%, and the customer count rose from 678 to 800, including Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The revenue forecast for the year was raised slightly, and the company expected to have billings by year-end of nearly $1 billion.Happy days, right? But the net loss widened and that's not in fashion so yesterday it lost nearly 5% of its value, starting today at about $86/share. That's the way it is. When people decide they want growth again the shares will recover - Amazon.com also fell hard in Thursday trading - and investors need to be prepared for bad things that have nothing to do with their company's fundamentals as a result.The importance of these companies is that they herald the next evolution of cloud, away from infrastructure or platforms into full-fledged database-based solutions that companies will consider as bolt-ons for existing infrastructure and, eventually, as replacements for that infrastructure. Software that can address the cloud as one system, and really use that power to drive organizational change, is going to be incredibly valuable over the next two years, and every large software provider is going to have to be there if it is to survive.You buy these on weakness. If the troubles in Ukraine get worse both these stocks are going to be badly hurt. That's when you want to go in."
2449055,52012,2014-08-25T13:08:09-04:00,WDAY is overvalued on an absolute basis.It's overvalued relative to its peers.Much of its rise may be explained by rampant stock-based compensation being improperly discounted by the street.,"In a recent SA article, I noted the strong discrepancy between LinkedIn's (LNKD) actual GAAP earnings versus the non-GAAP earnings which were typically reported in the financial media - with the difference being largely attributable to stock-based compensation (SBC). I observed that a focus on non-GAAP earnings leads to what Warren Buffett famously described as ""bad thinking"". I also noted that:(See the article for full details).This weekend, while running through some valuation screens, I found another overvalued company - Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) - which actually managed to (slightly) top LNKD's stock-based compensation and its valuation.History and ValuationWDAY is a company focused on providing cloud-based HCM solutions, describing itself this way:In 2012 the company was brought public at an offering price of $28 in a very successful IPO run by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and a strong cohort of co-managers. Since then the stock has tripled and at Friday's closing price of $88.42, the basic valuation statistics now stand as follows:Workday's principal strengths are an incredible growth rate, two highly successful and proven founders in Dave Duffield and Aneel Bhusri, and a strong balance sheet. But do these strengths justify the company's valuation? On a historical basis, it is very rare for any company to grow into the type of valuation presented above. Yet if that doesn't suffice, another way to answer the valuation question is to look at comparables.In its 10Q, WDAY mentions its competitors, including this excerpt:Now SAP and ORCL won't be directly comparable because WDAY is a much younger and smaller company, though growing very quickly:WDAY Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsBut what of the purchases of the competing companies? Taleo was bought at around 6X sales, SuccessFactors at 10X. Yet WDAY is currently trading at 30X sales! Other metrics are difficult, because WDAY doesn't make money, nor is it expected to in the foreseeable future, which leads to this EPS comparison:WDAY EPS Basic (Quarterly) data by YChartsIt's not clear to me why continued losses should warrant a price to sales premium, but that's the case today.As to management, a big part of the rationale for the SuccessFactors and Taleo purchases were to bring on board talented and innovative managers. Thus it's unlikely that WDAY deserves a 3X to 5X valuation premium to those companies at the time of their purchases or a 5X to 7X multiple to ORCL and SAP now based solely on management.Stock-Based Compensation is Underestimated by the StreetAs with LNKD, I believe that one important reason for which WDAY has arrived at its current overvaluation, is that the street uncritically uses WDAY's ""core earnings"" metric to justify its price, yet core earnings don't count stock-based compensation among other things. Here's the breakdown from the recent 10Q:As seen from the table, the company's operating loss more than doubles when stock-based compensation is included, yet Wall Street has a simple response: simply exclude it!Not surprisingly, given that the company is given a pass on its stock-based compensation - it, and the number of shares outstanding has tended to grow at an accelerating rate, both absolutely and relatively:WDAY Shares Outstanding data by YChartsWDAY Stock Based Compensation (Quarterly) data by YChartsWDAY Stock Based Compensation (% of Annual Revenues) data by YChartsIn my opinion, this trend, coupled with sky-high valuations, set up a lucrative long term short opportunity. As a result I'm short the stock, however, as WDAY releases earnings after hours on Wednesday and has a history of beating estimates, I only have a small ""starter"" short position currently. I expect to add to that shortly after the earnings release."

This is because so much energy is expended chasing something elusive that one is often ill prepared for what comes next. Oh, how we miss having conversations with people about why Castlight (NYSE:CSLT) and Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) aren't scaring us out of our Veeva (NYSE:VEEV) short, and better yet why we are happily shorting growth stocks into earnings that we are dead certain will beat and raise guidance. Yep, those were the days. What we wouldn't give for another Castlight to come along or for some VC to coin another catchphrase like ""Vertical is the new horizontal."" Or if we could just turn back the clock a bit to right before David Einhorn's epic athenahealth (NASDAQ:ATHN) presentation. Just a few more YouTube clips of Jonathan Bush making outlandish claims like he invented the question mark would be nice.O Bubble, Bubble! wherefore art thou bubble?We spent so much time getting to know each other over the past year, and then poof you are gone. No phone call, no email, and not even a WhatsApp message. We woke one day feeling more like Batman in a Joker-less world, left to sift through the post-apocalyptic tech momo ruins. There is something decidedly unsettling about having momentum investors actually agree with you about anything. Markets don't seem right to us when the momo crowd are not behaving like Superman with the FirEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) trunk. What you are short Veeva too? What color is the sky above? Who got the better end of the Bergdahl trade? Please, let's disagree on something so we can get our bearings back.Who knows, maybe this is what short-seller depression feels like. Did Prozac Nation cover this? Is there some sub-specialist on Wall Street that we can talk to? Will reading Shantaram help pass the time till the next bubble? So many questions so few answers. Maybe participating in the next funding round for Uber will help ease the pain. Or how about a sit down with the self-proclaimed 'Supergenius' from the Tesla shareholder meeting, maybe he has the answers.Just one good idea is all it's going to take to get us out of this funk.What about shorting Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) on Willow thesis? Both appear to be overachieving conjurers. Now if we could just find the connection between Madmartigan, Tiger, and Chase Coleman. Is Julian Robertson a Ron Howard fan?Ok, that's a bit of a stretch. But as you can see, a bubble-less world can be a lonely place for a short-seller.But luckily for us momo investors have the memory of a goldfish.So while we look forward to the journey of self-discovery a bubble-less world might provide; we were happy to discover that we get to postpone our existential reckoning till another day.As usual, all we had to do was wait a bit for our momo friends to get restless and start chasing the same stocks again!And that is precisely what they have started to do.Like a Phoenix Rising from the Ashes…The momo stocks have come back to life over the past few weeks.And with momo's back en vogue, it is time to start putting the post bubble pop reflate short trades on.The notable difference being that this time around we will focus on the crème de la crème instead of the trash.Short Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY)Shorting Workday is probably our single best idea in the SAAS space right now, and it doesn't take more than few paragraphs to get across. Now some people might think this is a ridiculous statement, but we suggest you hear us out. Before the bubble popped, Workday was a stock we steered clear of on the short side along with other tier one names and even some tier two SAAS names. The logic being that until a bubble pops its existence remains debatable, and thus valuing stocks in such a sector is an exercise in futility. With valuation generally on ice, what matters most in such an environment is simply execution, story, and perception. As far as Workday went, you were guaranteed to lose big on all three. Consequently, we focused our energy on pseudo SAAS stocks or on SAAS names where we believed we could articulate a multi-pronged and airtight argument as we did with Veeva. But post-bubble, the tier one names is the place we believe you should be if you are looking for short exposure.The Big Short:""I don't get it""We think the best way to explain our Workday short thesis is by drawing an analogy to Josh Baskin's (played by Tom Hanks) boardroom stealing moment in the movie Big. For those that have not seen the film, after listening to tons of data and studies about a potential new toy, Josh takes over the meeting with his basic ""I don't get it"" question. ""What's fun about a building that turns into a robot,"" he asks the room filled with toy executives? A seemingly simple and innocent question that somehow turns into a boardroom wakeup call. It's a priceless moment on film, and it sums up exactly how we feel about Workday.We simply don't get it!We literally can picture ourselves in a room filled with Workday bulls rattling off revenue growth metrics, facts about the founders (Duffield moonlights as Batman and Bhusri churns out new talent modules in his sleep), new modules that will soon be released, and everything else under the sun you can think of about this great company.And then little old us sitting in the back of the room with our hand raised waiting to be called on….""Blah, blah, blah. We don't get it!""This is still a $15 billion company that sells HCM software trading at 30x trailing revenue. ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) grew at a faster clip last year of an almost identical revenue base, and yet has half the market cap. What about Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM)? 8.5x the revenue, superior margins, grew at roughly half the rate of Workday last year, and it's only double the market cap. Aren't these both loved SAAS Cloud companies? Actually, can't you make a convincing argument that both of these companies are much better positioned in their respective parts of the SAAS atmosphere than Workday is in the much more crowded HCM space? We think you can, and this is where the Workday short comes in. The company is so good that it's bad.If you surveyed 50 seemingly educated market participants on what is the world's leading SAAS company, we bet the responses would come back an even split between Workday and Salesforce.com. That is pretty remarkable when you consider just how much money Salesforce.com spends on marketing, and how much bigger they are as a company. So what gives? Well, the founders' background played a huge part, but to be frank Workday simply came public at the right time.For example, if Salesforce.com had gone public last year we think it would have hit a $75-$100 billion market cap at the peak of the bubble, and would probably still be trading 50% higher than where it is today.To be clear we are citing Salesforce.com here not just because it is a massive cloud leader, but more importantly because a lot of short sellers continue to focus on the name.Our message to them: Get your head out of the Clouds!How can anyone be short Salesforce.com in a world in which Workday trades at the valuation it does?We could accept these distortions pre-bubble collapse when the likes of Veeva could hit $7.5 billion and Castlight opened at $4 billion, but tight floats and IPO mania had a lot more to do with that than actual sector valuation disconnects. Now that everything is no longer simply rising with the tide, it's hard not to simply look at Workday and conclude where it sits between #1 and #3 in the cloud makes little sense.Then again this is Workday we are talking about here. No SAAS company gets more press and more love from the media than these guys. Are they an HCM software company or are they about to cure cancer? It's a seemingly crazy question to ask, but one that is justified based on where the stock is trading relative to everything else.We love this short because it can be hedged with a long position in Salesforce.com, and because it really is that simple. What made Workday invincible before is no longer as much of a concern. More investors should be willing to take a look at the name and reach the same conclusion we have. That has not happened yet, and we say this having scoured everything written about WDAY on SA, Sumzero and other places in the financial media where we usually come across some sort of decently articulated skepticism. The extent of the Workday bearishness has been limited to simple valuation calls early on that focused on analyzing the name within the context of traditional/historical valuation metrics that apply to any stock. We have yet to come across anyone making the simple case that Workday makes the other SAAS titans look like value stocks. Why? Well, our theory is it simply was not the right time in the cycle. A lot of garbage had to be exposed before investors could justify thumbing their noses at the likes of Workday.Another interesting development with WDAY shares is the ever-increasing short interest, and we're sure this is a point skeptics will highlight. Short interest has steadily increased in the stock over the past year, but when compared to the average volume traded it has actually dropped, below are the statistics courtesy of Nasdaq:Workday's short interest has nearly doubled since January 2014, but in the big picture short interest is still less than 15% of the float. So the 'short squeeze' argument that seems to be playing out in the likes of Zillow is not a factor here. We could easily conceive short interest jumping to 30%+ of float, which would not bode well for longs especially since so much of the accumulation in the stock is from recent levels.Now, all you need to do is take this simple table (below), and challenge the bulls to provide you with an explanation. There is no need to debate the SAAS or Cloud fundamentals here. Heck, you can even tell them you are the biggest believer in the space, and then sit back and watch them squirm as they try to explain this distortion.Cloudy with a Chance of TAMWe want to keep this short simple and fun for now, but for those prepared to dig in the TAM story here is a good one. HCM, where WDAY derives almost all of its revenue these days, is arguably as small as $5 billion and no bigger than $10 billion. That puts the current market cap at 1.5x to roughly 3x the HCM market size (not exactly a Veeva which at its peak was trading at 7.5x-15x the LS CRM market TAM as a value added reseller, but still pretty eye-popping considering the competitive landscape difference). Workday is not just about HCM though. Financial accounting, procurement, project management, and T&E are in their grand plans of ERP domination. How big is that broader market? Well, something around $30 to $40 billion seems right with HCM and Financial Accounting making up 75% of that. So, Workday is basically being valued at half the broader market size despite being somewhere to the tune of 1-2% penetrated with negative 20% operating margins. We'd call this being just a bit overly optimistic.The Iron Throne of HR SoftwareWe mentioned competitive landscape distinction versus a vertical like Veeva being an issue, but we think that's an understatement. We liken Workday's quest to conquer the HCM space to that of one house maintaining a firm grip over the Seven Kingdoms on Game of Thrones. It's just not something you want to bet on, and definitely not when everyone else thinks it's a sure thing.Keeping up with all the players involved in the HCM space is just as challenging of a task as following all the characters, plots, and subplots on Game of Thrones. We could probably put out a fifty-page report on all the players involved, but for now this bird's-eye view should suffice.Oracle (NYSE:ORCL)- The House of Ellison is strong with virtually unlimited resources and influence across the seven kingdom of enterprise resource management. Currently their traditional HR offerings consists of the comprehensive HCM Oracle E business Suite as well as PeopleSoft suite. However, Oracle's cloud HCM roadmap has really centered on its Taleo acquisition. Basically, they have chosen to leverage Taleo's strength in recruiting and performance/goal management to cross-sell a talent cloud suite to existing EBS/PeopleSoft customers seeking SAAS solutions in talent management as well as to new clients.SAP (NYSE:SAP)- In the East, SAP has chartered a similar path to the Iron throne. They continue to offer their traditional HCM/ERP Business Suite for those seeking on-premise offerings as well as simply focusing on core HR functionality, and have turned to their recently acquired SuccessFactors army to fight the SAAS battle. Like Oracle has leveraged Taleo's recruiting strength, SAP has leveraged SuccessFactors performance and learning modules to sell a full suite of talent cloud solutions.IBM (NYSE:IBM)- From the North, IBM is leveraging its Kenexa acquisition to also offer a broad talent management suite to its large global installed customer base. The notable difference being a much broader emphasis on the strong assessment/analytics offerings of their recruiting module.Cornerstone OnDemand (NASDAQ:CSOD)- Born of pure SAAS lineage, this leader in learning and performance management has excelled by building strategic alliances instead of marrying into one of the larger houses.These are just a few of the players jostling for a piece of the Iron Throne of HCM.The SilkRoad warriors from beyond the wall, the Halogen (HGN.TO) Knights, the SumTotal Watchmen, the Ultimate (NASDAQ:ULTI) Warriors, Prince Ceridian, the Giants of the ADP (NASDAQ:ADP) Islands, NetSuite's (NYSE:N) Tribe Soldiers, and the PeopleFluent Changelings are amongst a few of the other players you are bound to come across in the land of HCM.Make no mistake Workday is a monster success story, but the stock is about five years ahead of itself assuming flawless execution. Doing the math on 10% net margin assumption and a commanding 10% market share of the broader $40 billion ERP space over the next 4-5 years, (both unbelievably generous assumptions) still gets you a stock that should be trading at half where it is today. Thus, it is a better short at this juncture than plenty of bad businesses, and from a risk reward standpoint we can't ask for much more. Our view is that there is an easy 25-30% downside in this name from current levels, given at least a 6-month timeline. The key word here is 'easy'. There are plenty of short opportunities with far greater upside in this space, but frankly none are as easy to single out as a pure outlier in the way Workday is relative to the other big boys. This is what makes it unique as a 'short idea' at this point in time. There are about a dozen sub $3 billion recent tech IPOs/SAAS stocks, which you could convincingly argue have 50% plus downside. There are also a handful of names like Castlight that you could argue will lose 75%+ of their value. While we are short several of these stocks, it's really tough to single out one or the other at this point. Tight floats and super high short interests guarantee a slower bumpier ride for the collective next leg of their journey into market oblivion. Basically, these are all more appropriate long-term basket shorts here versus the singled-out case we see in Workday shares.DISCLAIMERSuhail Capital Limited is an exempted company registered in the Cayman Islands (""Suhail Capital"") is an investment advisor to funds that actively participate in the buying and selling securities and other financial instruments.You should assume that as of the publication date of this report, Suhail Capital (possibly along with or through our partners, affiliates, employees, and/or consultants) along with our clients and/or investors and/or their clients and/or investors has a short position in Workday Inc.

It was always about ""what ifs.""On Tuesday the Software-as-a-Service (NASDAQ:SAAS) giant soundly beat its first-quarter earnings estimates and projected better-than-expected guidance. In so doing, Workday demonstrates it can effectively handle the competition and manage growth.While these shares aren't cheap at around $82 per share, risk-adverse investors that get in now can have a $100 stock in the next 6 to 12 months. If guidance was any indication, this fast-growing cloud company can still deliver strong returns of 22%.First-quarter revenue surged 74% year over year to $159.7 million, beating Street estimates by roughly 5%, topping expectations of $152.4 million. Growth has never been a problem for this company. The issue has always been profits, which took a surprising turn for the better this quarter.The most popular bearish argument for Workday has been that the company makes no money, especially when compared to bigger rivals like [[SAP]] and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).But Workday has always believed it can deliver similar-to-slightly-better services for prices that are close to 50% below what enterprises currently pay. This time, with a narrower loss of 13 cents per share (excluding items), which beat estimates of a loss of 15 cents, the aggressive undercutting didn't hurt that badly.Equally impressive was that Workday said its billings were at $208 million, or 26% above analysts expectations of $165 million. Management said that the company ""benefited from several new large customers."" Billings is the metric that denotes the strength of future revenue.In what has been a brutal enterprise spending environment, the rate at which Workday continues to land multimillion-dollar deals is nothing short of remarkable. And based on management's guidance, the company doesn't expect this trend to end any time soon.For the August quarter, management projects revenue in the range of $173 million to $178 million, which represents a year-over-year jump of 61% to 65%. Analysts were expecting $171.5 million. In terms of earnings, although the company does not offer profit guidance, the Street expects a per-share loss (excluding items) of 14 cents, widening by a penny above last year.But as I noted recently, profitability is not what the Street is paying for today. That said, investors have to understand what they are paying for. And the risks that come with not meeting expectations. Workday is far from a perfect company, yet the stock is priced for perfection.The good news is that the company is seeing increased demand for its services and expertise in human capital management solution. To that end, as long as the company continues to deliver growth ahead of demand expectations, these shares should do well.With the stock still down roughly 30% from its 52-week high, there is still upside potential here. On the basis of long-term revenue growth and market share gains in SaaS and enterprise resource planning, I see these shares hitting $100 by the end of the year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Wall Street Playbook's tech sector analyst.

In fact, Workday just announced the acquisition of Identified, a developer of HR analytics software that provides insights into job candidates and recruiting activity.Let's take a look at WDAY from a performance, valuation, and technical angle and test it out to see if it makes the cut as a Best Stock Now.PerformanceThe first test we'll put this stock through is the performance test. I look for strong performance over the short, intermediate, and long-term when compared against the other 3,800+ stocks in my database.Data from Best Stocks Now AppWorkday went public on October 12, 2012 at $28 per share. The stock is up 260% since then! I would say that the shares have seen performance, and then some!Over the last twelve months the stock is up 88.4%, while the S&P 500 is up 23.3%. This places it amongst the best of the best as it relates to performance. The stocks currently earns a momentum grade of ""A.""ValuationThis is the next test we will put WDAY through. The stock has performed well in the past; how will it do in the future? Let's find out.Workday is not yet profitable, but topline sales growth is growing rapidly. Over the last four quarters, Workday's revenue has grown by 74%, 76%, 72%, and 61%.Workday has an army of over 25 analysts that currently cover the company. The consensus earnings growth estimate over the next five years is a whopping 50% per year.Data from Best Stocks Now AppI love growth. Fifty percent growers do not come along very often.I would expect Workday to become profitable by late next year. If they indeed can then grow those earnings by 50% per year going forward, I could see a stock with the potential to hit $175 per share plus five years from now.Workday passes my performance test.Workday passes my valuation test.Let's see if it passes the final test.Stock ChartIf WDAY has a healthy stock chart, it passes the final test. I do not want to see any sideways, down, or extended uptrends, unless the valuation is still compelling. And of course the most dangerous trend of all is a topping out trend that is beginning to roll over.WDAY is currently in a healthy uptrend. You can see the big upside reaction that the stock had recently when it blew out EPS estimates. I like what I see. WDAY passes my final test.Gunderson Stock GradeWhen I combine WDAY's performance, valuation, and stock chart and compare it against all 3,835 stocks in my database, it earns the #22 spot on my list of Best Stocks Now. It also earns a Gunderson Stock Grade of 'A+' and it is a stock that I own at Gunderson Capital Management in my aggressive growth accounts.Data from Best Stocks Now AppWorkday is a very, very aggressive growth stock. If the appetite for risk comes out of this market, it will be very vulnerable too some swift profit-taking. I never marry a stock. If the performance, valuation, or chart changes, I will sell the stock.Follow me on Twitter for any change in my opinion of WDAY.Disclosure: I am long WDAY.

2238733,62713,2014-05-27T09:00:09-04:00,"With the stock still down roughly 33% from its 52-week high, Workday's vacation is over.On the basis of long-term revenue growth and market share gains in SaaS and ERM, these shares are a sure-bet to reach $100 by the end of the year.Workday has (seemingly) more business than it can service, which is a problem every company wants to have.","Due to valuation concerns, software stocks have been hit hard in 2014. And very few have taken a pounding to the extent of Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), whose shares are down more than 30% since hitting an all-time high of $116 on Feb. 28. Shares closed Friday at $78.30, down 6% year to date. But it's not yet time for panic.As with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), Workday is a disrupter in the enterprise software market. The company has built itself into a dominant Software-as-a-Service (SAAS) provider and has stolen share from the likes of IBM (NYSE:IBM) and SAP (NYSE:SAP). And when you factor in Workday's capabilities in human capital management software, the company is running laps around companies still running traditional business models based on contracts and bundled licenses.Workday, by contrast, offers cloud-based services that help enterprises operate daily HR tasks, including payroll and employee benefits. And with better-than-expected earnings results just released from Salesforce, I don't see a scenario where Workday's growth engine will slow any time soon. The company will report fiscal first-quarter earnings Tuesday. And investors still on the sidelines would be wise to punch in their time cards now.The Street will be looking for revenue of $152.3 million, which represents a 66% year-over-year jump. The company is expected to match last year's loss of 15 cents per share (excluding items). For the full year, the company is expected to post a loss of 55 cents per share on revenue of $735 million, up 57% year over year.Over the past couple of quarters, Workday has done well securing large multimillion dollar deals. When compared to larger players like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Workday believes it can offer similar-to-slightly-better services at half the cost. Not to mention, it can offer these services without licenses and long-term maintenance contracts. Enterprises have responded in a big way.To that end, on Tuesday, investors should focus on the company's billings metric, which denotes the strength of future sales. Workday has performed well in this department as billings have stayed above 30% for the past couple of quarters. Some of this has been the result of aggressive discounting and various promotions.More than anything, this has been what has kept value investors at bay. The margin situation hasn't been pretty. But profitability is not what the Street is paying for today. The company is seeing increased demand for its services and demand for its expertise in human capital management solution.And when it comes to enterprise resource planning (ERP), Workday has (seemingly) more business than it can service, which is a problem every company wants to have. Management has begun to address this need with investments in its capacity. And this, too, will take a toll on near-term margins and profits. But the bet is that it will all be worth it in the end.With the stock still down roughly 33% from its 52-week high, Workday's vacation is over. On the basis of long-term revenue growth and market share gains in SaaS and enterprise resource planning, these shares are a sure-bet to reach $100 by the end of the year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Wall Street Playbook's tech sector analyst.

The market is dominated by three key players - SAP, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY). In 2011, IDC estimated SAP to own 17.4% of the market, followed by Oracle's 12.4% share and Workday's 3.5% market share. Since then though, the landscape has changed significantly with both SAP and Oracle adding to their portfolios SuccessFactors and Taleo, respectively, and Workday going public.Workday's FinancialsWorkday's Q4 revenues grew 76% over the year to $141.9 million. Net loss of $0.13 per share was lower than previous year's loss of $0.16 per share. The market was expecting revenues of $138 million with a loss of $0.16 per share. By segment, subscription revenues grew 86% over the year to $110.72 million. Professional services grew 42% over the year to $31.15 million.They ended the year with revenue of $468.9 million, up 71% over the year, and a loss of $0.54 per share.For the current quarter, Workday projected revenues of $148 million-$153 million, compared with the Street's projections of $148 million. Workday expects to end the current year with revenues of $710 million-$740 million, ahead of the market's target of $706 million.Workday's Recent AcquisitionLast week, Workday announced the acquisition of private recruiting focused company Identified, Facebook's Professional Twin, for an unidentified sum. The move is expected to help Workday get a leading advantage in the world of social sourcing. San Francisco-based Identified is an HR Predictive analytics firm best known for their technology SYMAN, which uses big data analytic tools to gather data from social media networks like Facebook to identify potential job opportunities.Back in 2012, when I had spoken with Identified's co-founder, Adeyemi Ajao, the company had more than 10 million members already. Workday plans to leverage Identified's strong technical skills to enhance their search engine and integrate predictive analytics offerings into their suite of applications. They should also be able to integrate Identified's social sourcing skills into their talent acquisition service, Workday Recruiting. Workday Recruiting is sold as an additional service to their human capital management service. Since the beginning of this year, Recruiting has already added 39 new customers to their list. Next up? Perhaps TalentCircles, a cloud-based social talent engagement platform.Workday's Product EnhancementMeanwhile, Workday continued to upgrade their product offerings and has released a new web portal with an improved user interface. It features an enhanced visual interface on HTML5 and several intuitive features. They have also released an upgrade to Workday 21. This is the first update to be released that leverages Workday's shift to a single code line for development and production environments that will help improve the frequency of innovation delivered to customers, while ensuring minimal disruption of services.They are also growing their geographic reach, especially in EMEA. In the next few years, they plan to add new services to their products in these markets. For instance, they plan to introduce Workday Payroll in U.K. and France in the next few years.Their stock is trading at $106.30 with a market capitalization of $18.62 billion. It touched a year high of $116.47 earlier last week.Disclosure: No positions"
1866361,51452,2013-11-27T11:29:13-05:00,,"As background for this article, please see my previous two Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) articles published July 3 and August 28. Despite the October/November correction for many of the highest-growth, higher valuation stocks, Workday shares are up 25% over the five months since July 8 - and up 10% over the three months since August 28 with more than all of that gain a result of yesterday's 12% rise in the share price.Workday reported 76% revenue growth for its October FQ3, up from 61% in FQ1 and 72% in FQ2. It is the fastest growing cloud computing company by a factor of two. By comparison, NetSuite (NYSE:N) and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) posted sales growth of 34% and 36%, respectively, in their most recent quarters.Workday has a high valuation but I suggest it is warranted by this high growth and its strong leading position in the new market for cloud-based services to replace traditional software to handle human resource management (HRM) and financials as well. Plus it has new Big Data offerings that provide the ability to analyze and make better real-time decisions from employee data.The stellar and accelerating growth at Workday is most greatly being driven by winning business with more larger customers. As with any new young company with leading technology, it has had to prove itself to enterprises. That was easiest to do with medium size businesses but now it is winning more larger deals with larger enterprises. And its service is being adopted more extensively by more divisions of existing customers,This is one of the most classic of growth positionings that can last years and thereby provide a superior multi-year investment. Workday is a $500 million company that I expect will be able to grow to be a several billion dollar company over the next few years. Workday just reported a 76% revenue growth quarter. But if it grows at just 50% per year over the next four years it could be a $2.5 billion company - five times its current size by 2017.The opportunity for this kind of growth is in front of Workday. The Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) HR non-cloud software markets represent many billions of potential TAM, not to mention the far larger market for financials software.Workday management just needs to execute and I think it will. The management has proven track records and the company is one of the hottest places to work here in Silicon Valley so it can hire the best and brightest people. The company is known as one of the most employee-oriented of all Silicon Valley companies. As Workday management likes to say, happy employees lead to happy customers and superior returns for investors.If you like the comfort of modest valuations in your investments, Workday shares are not for you. But if you like to invest in great growth businesses, I suggest you consider ownership in this fine high-growth company. Of course, it would be ideal to buy on a correction but I suggest initiating at least partial positions at current levels. Please feel free to ask me any questions you may have.Disclosure: I am long WDAY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

2144123,24157,2014-04-16T07:43:54-04:00,"I am bearish on the cloud sector and called out Netsuite, Salesforce, and Callidus before they crashed last month.Workday has the some issues as these other stocks: No profits and massive expectations built into stock prices.Increasing competition as giants like Oracle and SAP make the transition to the cloud should slow Workday's growth.Stock was driven by momentum, and now that momentum is gone there's no fundamental support to hold up the stock price.","Check out this week's Danger Zone Interview with Chuck Jaffe of Money Life and MarketWatch.com.We've made no secret about our bearishness on certain cloud stocks. Over the past several months, we've featured Callidus (NASDAQ:CALD), Netsuite (NYSE:N), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), and Tangoe (TNGO) in the Danger Zone. On average those stocks have dropped 14% since our calls. The cloud sector as a whole has been beat up with the First Trust ISE Cloud Computing Index ETF (NASDAQ:SKYY) down 7% over the past month while the S&P 500 is down only 2%.This week's Danger Zone stock, Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) has been hit worst than most. Over the past month it has dropped 25%. Some investors might be tempted to ""buy on the dip here"", but they should resist that temptation. WDAY remains significantly overvalued and has much farther to fall before it reaches a valuation supported by its fundamentals.Lack of ProfitabilityAnyone familiar with the sector knows that most of these high-flying cloud stocks don't make any money, and WDAY is no exception. WDAY actually is in worse shape here than most of its competitors. Its after-tax profit (NOPAT) margin currently stands at -32%, which is worse than N at -13%, CALD at -9%, and CRM at -4%.The argument WDAY bulls assert is that profits don't matter now as WDAY is boosting spending on sales and marketing and product development to spur revenue growth, which was 71% last year. Figure 1 shows the difference between WDAY's expenses and those of a mature company like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL).Figure 1: WDAY vs. ORCL SpendingSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsWe can see from figure 1 that WDAY spends, as a % of revenue, nearly double the amount of Oracle on Sales & Marketing and nearly triple on Product Development. Its gross margin is also significantly lower as 24% of WDAY's revenue still comes from its very low margin Professional services segment, which exists more to retain customers than to actually generate cash flow.Bulls will argue that if WDAY just cut down those two expenses, Sales & Marketing and Product Development, it could instantly be profitable. WDAY could reach profitability by cutting those two expenses to the same % of revenue as Oracle; however, the company's after-tax profit (NOPAT) would be a meager $40 million. Remember, this is a company with a market cap of nearly $14 billion. The current valuation makes no sense.Valuation Carries Unreasonable ExpectationsEven after dropping 25%, WDAY's valuation remains far too high. To justify its ~$75/share valuation, WDAY would need to grow revenue by 40% compounded annually for the next 10 years while working its way up to a 9% NOPAT margin.I find it awfully hard to believe that WDAY can continue its high rate of revenue growth for another 10 years. The NOPAT margin goal is feasible, but to do so WDAY would have to cut its marketing expenses, which would in turn slow revenue growth.The point here is that this company cannot maintain high revenue growth while also achieving profitability. We have seen how this game has ended for other tech companies like Salesforce.com , Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NetFlix (NASDAQ:NFLX). All those companies sacrificed profitability for growth with the promise that one day they would be very profitable. And, yet, all three have achieved no better than 4th or 5th quintile returns on invested capital (ROIC). Back in 2006, CRM was roughly in the same place as WDAY is today, with high growth and no profits. Sure enough, eight years later CRM continues to lose money.Companies like WDAY and CRM have been able to operate at a loss for years because investors have chosen to tolerate the losses. Momentum buyers have taken the company line and pushed the stocks up. Low interest rates have made it easy to borrow to maintain liquidity, and executives have been compensated generously. In 2013, WDAY's top four highest earning executives made $23 million, mostly in the form of restricted stock grants. When executives are rewarded for losing money, what incentive do they have to turn a profit?Catalyst: Market Has Fallen Out of Love With the Momentum StocksCompanies with no profits commanding market caps in the tens of billions only happen in bull markets. When investors get skittish, these high-flying stocks are the first to get crushed as we've already seen this year.While I don't expect a full on bear market, I do think we're seeing the start of a major correction in several areas that have reached dangerously high levels of valuation. Cloud stocks, along with social media stocks and REITs, are going to keep falling because they don't have the fundamentals to support their stock prices.WDAY should take more of a beating than most, as its valuation is even more stretched than its competitors. It currently has a price to sales (P/S) ratio of 30, whereas N trades at a P/S of 15 and CRM trades at a P/S of 8.Hidden LiabilitiesAdditionally, WDAY has diluted its stock quite aggressively. WDAY has over 20 million employee stock options outstanding, equivalent to a liability of $1.3 billion (nearly 10% of its market cap) at its current price. If we take into account its secondary stock offering last year, WDAY added 18 million shares in 2013, diluting its stock by another 11%.WDAY's reliance on issuing stock, both as a form of compensation and as a way to raise money, could create a negative feedback loop if the stock price begins to fall quickly. In order to compensate its employees as well, WDAY will have to issue even more stock options, diluting the shares further and causing the stock to drop even more.Momentum was the only thing supporting WDAY's stock, and now that the momentum is gone, look out below.Falling Into the ""Sector Theme Trap""Last year I discussed the ""sector trap"" in my analysis of Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB). Investors are liable to look at a high growth sector and think that any name in the sector is automatically a good investment. When investors and analysts fall into this trap, fundamental research suffers and stocks can reach untenable valuations, which is exactly what has happened with the cloud stocks.Even if a sector is growing rapidly, as the cloud computing sector certainly is, individual companies within the sector can wind up being losers. What's worse, it is almost impossible to identify who these losers are going to be. One can draw comparisons to many new, emerging sectors from the past from automobiles to personal computers. And in nearly every instance, a company that's on top one year finds itself at the back of the pack in the next.Personal computers were the sexy, high-growth market in the early 1980's with Commodore Computers as one of the bright, early stars in the space. However, an investment in Commodore Computers would have ended poorly. Even though personal computers continued to boom, Commodore found itself left in the dust. Meanwhile, IBM (NYSE:IBM), an established company with scale, name recognition, and superior resources benefited massively from the PC boom.I'm not necessarily saying that WDAY is going to be the next Commodore Computers, but it certainly could be as could CRM or N or any of the other high-flying cloud stocks. Meanwhile, Oracle and SAP (NYSE:SAP) are transitioning to the cloud. ORCL and SAP still have massive advantages in terms of overall market share and name recognition in the ERP market. Just because they're a little late to the game doesn't mean they won't end up the winners.Cloud computing is still a fairly new industry, and for a while companies have been able to carve out their niches and operate with little competition. That honeymoon is over as the big companies enter the fray and the up-and-comers start to expand into new areas. WDAY acknowledges in their most recent 10-K, ""We expect continued consolidation in our industry that could lead to significantly increased competition."" In addition to ORCL and SAP, WDAY looks likely to come into more competition with N in the near future.Low Reward and High RiskAs we showed above, WDAY is already priced for massive growth. Even if the company executes flawlessly on its strategic vision and continues to grow rapidly for the next decade, the upside for the stock is limited because expectations are already so high. On the other hand, the downside for WDAY is quite large. This company is burning through cash, diluting its stock by 10% a year, and facing an increasingly competitive environment.Insiders aren't jumping ship just yet, but the fact that they've sold 220,000 shares (5% of shares held) with no purchases over the past six months suggests that they recognize the risk and are hedging their bets. If you hold WDAY, you should follow their lead and sell.Avoid These FundsInvestors should avoid the following ETFs and mutual funds as they allocate a significant amount to WDAY and earn our Dangerous or Very Dangerous rating.Sam McBride contributed to this report.Disclosure: David Trainer and Sam McBride receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, sector, or theme.

1866591,20521,2013-11-27T13:28:05-05:00,,"Gartner forecasts the SaaS market to grow 19.5% over the period 2011 through 2016 to $32.8 billion. Even at conservative estimates, researcher Tech Navio estimates the global software-as-a-service based enterprise resource planning software market is projected to grow 13.93% annually from 2012 through 2016. The high growth in the market is estimated to be driven by the increased adoption of these services by SMEs.Workday's FinancialsWorkday's (NASDAQ:WDAY) Q3 revenues grew 76% over the year to $127.9 million, surpassing the market's projections of $117.8 million. Loss of $0.12 per share was also significantly better than the previous year's loss of $0.39 per share and the Street's projections of loss of $0.17 per share for the quarter.By segment, subscription revenues grew 82% over the year to $93.93 million. Professional services grew 61% over the year to $33.95 million.For the current quarter, Workday projects revenues of $133 million - $138 million, compared with analyst projections of $129.1 million.Workday's Tie-Up with Salesforce.comAs part of Workday's efforts to make bigger inroads into the SaaS market, it is extending its partnership with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). Through the agreement, the two will integrate their product lines to offer to customers an end-to-end SaaS-based offering. Both Salesforce and Workday will thus standardize all their solutions for each other's applications. The integration of these applications should help customers to analyze performance and trends in customer relationships, provide greater security and enable users to receive updates regarding both the applications through Salesforce's Chatter service. The integration of Workday Financial Management into Salesforce will also enable customers to make more informed decisions based on the financial and operational performance data available on these two apps. This partnership is expected to help both Workday and Salesforce expand their market presence while ensuring they give other cloud vendors, particularly Oracle and SAP, tougher competition.Workday's ProfitabilityWorkday has been seeing strong growth in revenues, as is evident from its financials. But profits remain a matter of concern. While losses have narrowed considerably over the year, the company has yet to turn in any profits. The continued losses can be attributed to heavy investment in R&D and sales and marketing efforts, which have surpassed the benefits realized by the decreasing sales and general administrative expenses. In the recently ended quarter, Workday saw R&D expenses grow 76% to $49.35 million and sales and marketing expenses grow 66% to $54.05 million. The company's strong revenue growth has buoyed confidence into the company's performance, but it would be nicer to see that reflect in the profits as well.The stock is trading at $82.60 with a market capitalization of $14.33 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $84.42 in September 2013."
1869601,25120,2013-12-01T03:21:51-05:00,,"Shares of Workday (WDAY) jumped up following the release of its third quarter results on Monday after the market close.Investors are pleased with the re-acceleration of revenue growth and the solid guidance into the fourth quarter, as other firms have seen recent weakness.Despite the strong momentum in the third quarter I stick to my short position on continued worries about the premium valuation.Third Quarter ResultsWorkday generated third quarter revenues of $127.9 million, up 76% on the year before. Revenues came in far ahead of consensus estimates of $117.7 million.Operating losses came in at $40.4 million, roughly unchanged from last year. On a non-GAAP basis, operating losses narrowed from $23.5 million to $19.9 million.GAAP losses rose from $41.5 million to $47.5 million, with diluted losses coming in at $0.27 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, losses came in at $0.12 per share versus expectations for a loss of $0.17 per share. Note that in the second quarter, losses came in at $0.13 per share.Looking Into The ResultsWorkday saw very strong growth driven by subscription revenues which rose by 82% to $93.9 million.While growth is nothing short of being spectacular, costs keep increasing as well. Total operating costs rose by 48.3% to $168.3 million. General and administrative costs fell sharply compared to a year earlier on the back of incurred public offering related expenses last year.On the back of these lower costs and strong revenue growth, losses actually increased on an absolute basis. They narrowed from 56.3% to 31.6% of revenues on an operating basis.Noticeable is the huge increase in stock-based compensation which more than tripled to nearly $20 million for the quarter.Looking AheadWorkday is happy with the continued progress, seeing further growth into the fourth quarter. Fourth quarter revenues are seen between $133 and $138 million, up 63 to 69% on the year before, and up 5.9% on the quarter before.Consensus estimates for fourth quarter revenues stood at $129.1 million.ValuationWorkday ended its third quarter with $1.28 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company has $463 million in convertible senior notes outstanding, for a net cash position of little above $800 million.Revenues for the first nine months of the year came in at $327.1 million, up 70.2% on the year before. Net losses widened from $88.2 million to $116.5 million. The guidance implies that full year revenues are seen around $462 million, as losses could come in around $150 million.Trading around $82 per share, the market values Workday at $14.2 billion. This values operating assets of the firm at $13.4 billion, or 29 times annual revenues.Obviously, Workday does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveShares of Workday were offered at $28 per share in their initial public offering little over a year ago, in October of 2012. The offering took place after a strong pricing, as shares were initially to be sold at a $24-$26 price range. After a big opening day jump, shares have steadily risen to current levels in the low eighties.Between 2010 and 2012, Workday roughly quadrupled its annual revenues to $273.7 million. Losses increased as well, totaling $119.2 million in 2010. Both revenues and losses are expected to increase again in 2013.Investment ThesisThe third quarter was strong, notably on revenue growth which has been a big focus for Workday. Reported revenues of $127.9 million easily beat the company's own guidance at $115 to $118 million in quarterly revenues, issued last quarter.These recent events learn us that Workday might be conservative, but truth of the matter is that they had a stellar quarter. The third quarter outlook at the presentation of the second quarter results indicated 8.3% quarter-on-quarter revenue growth for the third quarter. This is expected to slow down to 5.9% in the fourth quarter, probably on the back of the very strong results in the third quarter.The increasing discrepancy between GAAP and non-GAAP losses is the result of larger stock-based compensation which increased to nearly $20 million for the quarter. Note that share-based compensation already accounts for an $0.11 per share divergence between both metrics, as these compensation expenses have tripled.Workday clearly stresses customer satisfaction as top priority. Earnings are not the second objective, in fact employee happiness is a key priority of the firm. Judging from these compensation expenses, it is easy to see why employees are happy to work there.Of course, Workday's valuation is entirely based on revenue growth, while a solid financial position allows the company to focus on growth over earnings for now. Last quarter, Workday raised $533 million by issuing two convertible notes, due in 2018 and 2020. Yet while topline growth has accelerated, subscription revenue growth slowed down to 82% on a year-on-year basis in the quarter, this was 92% in the second quarter.The performance, notably on revenue growth has been solid with growth re-accelerating a bit. Even when I apply a 50% growth rate for 2014 and 2015, shares trade at 13-14 times estimated revenues of $1 billion in 2015.This seems too far stretched in my opinion, and I stick with my short position.Disclosure: I am short WDAY.

Consequently, Workday should generate a substantial amount more cash flow from operations in the coming quarters. Additionally, Ultimate trades at steep multiplier model valuations.Concur Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:CNQR) is larger than Workday Inc by consolidated revenue and cash flow from operations. Concur is increasing financial leverage, which makes its market-based valuations less extreme than Workday's valuations. But Workday's recent debt offering could weigh on its market-based valuations.NetSuite, Inc. (NYSE:N) is about the same size as Workday by consolidated revenue and provides a basis for what Workday's financial results could look like in the coming quarters.This industry has lofty valuations; also, the leverage is increasing, and GAAP net losses are prevalent.The questions is, who will be the winners and who will be the losers? Time will tell and, at these valuations, waiting for the shakeout may be the best play.But I will examine my Workday financial performance forecasts to see if there is a good potential entry point based on valuation.First things first, I am maintaining my fiscal 2014 revenue forecast of $450 million.Next, I'm maintaining the forecast of $664 million of fiscal 2015 revenue, which implies a roughly 50% revenue growth rate.US Real GDP Growth data by YChartsLastly, if I assume a 50% growth rate of fiscal 2015 revenue, revenue would be just under $1 billion; meaning, I would be buying Workday at 13 times fiscal 2015 revenue.Point being, I would not accumulate shares of Workday above $40 per share.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1702792,24550,2013-09-19T10:41:13-04:00,,"Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) Wednesday (Sept. 18) announced a deeper relationship to ""join"" both companies' enterprise cloud software products. This announcement has all the standard integration talk, which sounds good for joint customers of course, but also spent some time making it clear that each company was using / planning on using the products of the other. In fact there's not a lot new in the announcement itself. Workday will integrate its HCM, financial and analytic applications to Salesforce Sales, Service and Marketing clouds. Salesforce will integrate Chatter more broadly into Workday as well. Both executives, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and Workday Co-CEO Aneel Bhusri, affirmed the ongoing partnership that the two have had for several years, and agreed that each company would ""standardize"" on the products offered by the other, since there's no functional overlap between the two companies, and both had already been using some of the products anyway.The announcement though, is perhaps more interesting for a few other reasons, including:What does it mean? Well, in truth maybe not much. Pre-integrating products is certainly good for joint customers, who would save the expense of custom integration. That same pre-integration, when trying to cross sell, is a pretty good sales tool as well. As an aside, reducing the amount of integration work is probably not something the system integrator partners of both firms enjoyed hearing. Cloud applications are already reducing the amount of implementation work by quite a bit, removing integration from the revenue stream is just another reduction. I will say though, I'll reserve judgment on that until the integrations are released and I talk to a few happy customers; prepackaged integrations are notoriously tough.It's clear that Salesforce is looking for ways to leverage partnerships to gain momentum and growth, which is no surprise either. Partnering with both companies, Workday and Oracle, doesn't really seem like a bad idea from Salesforce's perspective, and any joint customers would benefit as well. Of course all of Salesforce.com's applications compete head-to-head with Oracle, but not with Workday. For me I'm most curious how Salesforce plans to operate on Oracle Fusion HCM and Financials + Workday HCM and Financials; that's a lot of overlapping software..."
1661812,51452,2013-08-28T10:57:14-04:00,,"Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) reported another quarter of strong growth. In fact, its Y-Y revenue growth accelerated from 61% in its April quarter to 72% in its July FQ2. And these FQ2 sales were up 17.3% sequentially.On July 3rd, I wrote an article titled ""Workday: A Balanced and Positive View"" and recommended the stock for growth portfolios. In the eight weeks since, WDAY shares have gained 18%. Interestingly, that percentage is about one-fourth that 72% FQ2 annual sales growth.Workday shares have steadily performed each quarter since the company's October 2012 IPO. By quarter, the stock appreciation has been:For their October quarter, Workday management forecast 58-62% sales growth. For their FY2014 they raised their revenue growth guidance to 59-63%. This is the kind of growth that should keep Workday shares performing well for the balance of 2013, plus into and likely beyond 2014.Obviously growth may slow as the company grows larger. However, Workday is newly moving to provide its cloud-based human resources services to companies of any size (rather than being limited to ones with fewer than 200,000-300,000 employees) and cloud based financial apps as well. Workday is just now gaining the reputation the very largest companies will bet their futures with.Workday is not yet profitable because it is investing heavily to develop many new cloud services, including the financials and versions of their services tailored to the local needs of each country into which they are expanding. And they are hiring many additional salespeople to serve those new countries.But compared to that 72% YTY sales growth, expenses grew fast, but less rapidly. R&D increased 63%, sales & marketing increased 44% and G&A increased 54% versus a quarter last year without the expenses of being a public company. The loss per share was ($0.13), better than the anticipated ($0.18). With continued high sales growth, Workday should reach breakeven within 1-2 years and then move to substantial profits.By 2017 or 2018, continued 50%+ sales growth, 30% operating margins and a 20% tax rate could yield $4.00 in per share earnings. It helps that Workday has only a very modest 172 million shares outstanding. And it recently issued some convertible notes that will add only 7 million additional shares at a conversion price of $108 per share. They netted $533 million net proceeds from these notes, taking their cash balance to $1.3 billion. This is the kind of financial strength large customers like to see.I expect Workday to be a great investment for years to come. It is the kind of high growth company you can invest in and not have to trade to generate excellent returns on your money.As an interesting postscript insight into the mentality of Workday's management, here are the company's Core Values as presented on their company website. They are the kind of values on which a great company and much higher shareholder value can be built.A Simple Approach to Happy Customers, Employees, and FamiliesDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in WDAY over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1662632,25120,2013-08-28T14:57:38-04:00,,"Shares of Workday (WDAY) are trading largely unchanged after the provider of enterprise cloud-based applications released a decent set of second-quarter results on Tuesday after the market close.Even after the company issued an upbeat outlook, and is willing to sacrifice earnings for growth, I remain very cautious. The absolute valuation of the business is very high, even accounting for years of high growth going forwards. I hold on to my short position on valuation concerns.Second-Quarter ResultsWorkday generated second-quarter revenues of $107.6 million, up 72% on the year before. Revenues came in ahead of consensus estimates, which stood at $100.5 million, and ahead of Workday's own guidance of quarterly revenues of $97 to $101 million.Net losses came in at $36.0 million compared to $27.1 million last year. Losses per share totaled $0.21, compared to $0.78 last year. The only reason for narrowing losses per share is the dilution that took place.Adjusted losses came in at $0.13 per share, beating consensus estimates for losses of $0.18 per share.Looking Into The ResultsTotal revenue growth of 72% was boosted by subscription revenue growth, which increased by 92% to $81.1 million, thereby making up three quarters of total revenues. Service revenues grew at a much more modest pace as it is not intended as a revenue-generating business.Solid operating leverage reduced cost of sales by some 720 basis points to 37.9% of total revenues. Yet operating leveraged didn't occur in all cost categories. Research and development expenses rose by 70 basis points to 38.3% of total revenues. Sales and marketing expenses fell by 620 basis points to 41.1% of total revenues. Despite the relative drop in these expenses, Workday invested quite heavily in international markets.All in all operating loses narrowed by some 12 percent to 30.0% of total revenues over the past quarter...And The Rest Of The YearFor the current third quarter, Workday expects to generate revenues of $115 to $118 million. This implies that revenues are expected to grow between 58 and 62% on the year before. Revenues are expected to rise between 7% and 10% from the past quarter and the guidance is in line with analysts expectations of $115.3 million in quarterly revenues.Annual revenues are seen between $436 and $446 million, up 59% to 63% on the year before. This implies that fourth-quarter revenues are seen between $122 and $129 million, up 50%-58% on the year before. Consensus estimates for full-year revenues stood at $439.4 million.ValuationWorkday ended its second quarter with $1.30 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company operates with $458 million in convertible senior notes, for a net cash position of roughly $850 million.Revenues for the first six months of the year came in at $199.2 million, up 67% on the year before. Net losses widened to $69.0 million.Trading around $76 per share, the market values Workday at $13.1 billion, or its operating assets at $12.3 billion. This values the operating assets of the firm at 28 times annual revenues.Workday does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveShares of Workday were sold to the general public at $28 per share in October of last year. The offering was placed above an initial guided range of $24-$26 per share. From that point in time shares have steadily risen to recent highs around $78 per share.Between the calendar year of 2010 and 2012, Workday has increased its annual revenues from merely $68.1 million to $273.7 million. Net losses more than doubled to $119.2 million in the meantime.Investment ThesisWorkday has made quite a bit of progress over the past quarter. The issuance of two convertible notes due in 2018 and 2020 raised $533 million in proceeds, boosting the strength of its balance sheet.The company stresses that its focus is on growth and not profitability for the short term. Workday aims to grow by putting customer satisfaction first, followed by employee happiness.Crucial are Workday's subscription revenues, which rose by 92% on the year before. The duration of contracts signed over the past quarter totaled 3.5 years on average, thanks to a couple of five-year deals. Workday believes it can attain high renewal rates on these kinds of contracts. High renewal rates should be driven by the importance of Workday's applications for its clients, ease-to-use applications and frequent meaningful upgrades.Non-GAAP operating margins are seen between minus 23% and 27% for the third quarter, which is a bit disappointing as Workday is preferring growth over earnings at this stage in the game.Back in May of this year, I took a look at Workday's prospects after the company released its first-quarter results. Workday has made some progress by accelerating revenue growth in the meantime. This has come at the expense of GAAP earnings.I reiterate my standing from the time. While the performance over the past quarter was quite solid, the shares have run-up a bit further as well. Even when applying a 50% growth rate to annual revenues in the period 2013-2015, I see Workday achieving annual revenues of $1 billion by 2015.Trading around 12 times 2015's annual revenues seems a bit stretched to my opinion. Despite the fact that the recent run up hurt, I remain short.Disclosure: I am short WDAY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1700552,20521,2013-09-18T08:59:15-04:00,,"According to Gartner, the Software-as-a-Service market is projected to grow 20% over the period 2011 through 2016 to $32.8 billion. Within the market, CRM will be the largest market growing from $5 billion in 2012, to $9 billion by the year 2016. But the biggest growth within SaaS will be driven by Office Suites, which are projected to grow 49% annually over the period 2011 through 2016 and HR offerings will register the slowest growth at 6.7%. But that is not slowing down Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), which continues to deliver strong quarterly results.Workday’s FinancialsFor the second quarter, Workday’s revenues grew 72% over the year to $107.6 million, surpassing the market’s projections of $101.0 million. Loss of $0.19 per share was also significantly lower than the Street’s projections of a loss of $0.24 per share for the quarter.By segment, subscription revenues grew 92% over the year to $81.1 million. Professional services grew 29% over the year to bring in the remaining $26.4 million. During the quarter, Workday crossed the milestone of recording more than 500 customers.For the current quarter, Workday projects revenues of $115-$118 million. It expects to end the year with revenues of $436-$444 million.Workday’s Expanding Product OfferingsLast quarter, Oracle announced a partnership with Salesforce.com that announced the implementation of Oracle’s Fusion HCM and Financial cloud apps throughout the company. The move was a big win for Oracle as it helped it trump Workday. But Workday is not too concerned and is hoping to lure a bigger market with new offerings.It is continuing to invest in research and development and sales and marketing to develop newer products. R&D expenses grew 63% over the year to $37.4 million and sales expenses were up 44% to $42.1 million. It recently announced the availability of upgraded Workday 20 featuring Workday Big Data Analytics. The service has been designed in partnership with its customers and helps deliver business insights that help managers make better decisions on human resource and financial management. The service includes several features such as unification of multiple sources, sizes, and structures of data with Workday data, ability to compare compensation and payroll data with market averages, better insight into global payroll costs by integrating payroll-related with financial data to determine overhead costs and headcount analysis to provides staffing estimates. Within Finance, the solution now offers the ability to benchmark the organization’s performance with competition, various reports on sales revenue attainment, detailed revenue and customer profitability analysis.Workday is also now working on releasing an end-to-end student application that will integrate a system of record, mobile computing capabilities, big data analytics, and Workday’s administrative solution over the cloud to deliver student applications that will help colleges manage their student-related data. The application will help colleges with all processes of recruiting, admitting, awarding, enrolling, advising, retaining, billing and placement of students. Workday expects that educational institutions will be able to create customized learning paths for students based on their individual goals and performance. The product is expected to be available by the second half of 2014. The company has already tied up with four pilot customers for this project including Ivy League university, Yale. Analysts believe that the student services market is a largely untapped market worth $2 billion in software sales and if successful, the product will help Workday establish a strong position within the industry. If it can bridge the process for colleges and universities to seamlessly connect with employers, perhaps it would then become the standard for that market, and the worldwide youth unemployment problem can find a reasonable solution. Today, there is a large gap between what employers are looking for, in terms of skill-sets, and what skills students have. There is a strong opportunity to address this gap with a systematic platform.The company is executing extremely well thus far, and the stock chart reflects that performance. Of course, the software-as-a-service category has delivered some of the best performing newly public companies in recent times, and I am generally quite bullish on the sector.Furthermore, these kinds of strategies of entering the student services market and addressing macro level problems with creative approaches, if executed well, are the kinds of moves that create deep tentacles into customers. The SaaS category has an inherent ‘low exit barrier’ characteristic. However, the student services strategy seems like one that is sticky, and with a high exit barrier.I like it a lot.The market is pleased with Workday’s offerings. The stock is trading at $76.99 with a market capitalization of $13.4 billion. It touched a year high of $78.22 earlier last month. Holding on to the stock for a few years is likely to produce strong returns."
1457511,41921,2013-05-23T13:59:07-04:00,,"Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) reported earnings after the close today, May 22nd, and the stock zigged and zagged without giving a clear read on where it is headed next. One thing that is pretty much assured is that any decline in this stock will only be temporary. The company had its IPO in October 2012, when the stock opened at $28 per share and soared over 70% that day to close at $48 per share. Since that time, the stock has never really looked back. Today, Workday trades for over $65 a share and sports a market capitalization of close to $11B. It is this market cap that drives most investors crazy, as the company has no earnings and most analysts expect the company report losses for the foreseeable future. Workday also trades at 25x the consensus revenue estimate for FY2014 of $433M. From a valuation standpoint, the company has all the makings of a stock that those focused purely on valuation would find appealing as a short candidate. I am one of those who typically loves to short a company like Workday, with a valuation that is in the stratosphere by any metric you choose to apply. This company is different, and for a few reasons I will detail below, I would tell investors to hold their noses and not short this stock.Workday Is Not A Short CandidateIt pains me to argue that Workday is not a short candidate. Every fiber in me says this stock should go down because of its valuation. However, I have learned my lesson that valuation alone will not drive a stock down, no matter how far that valuation is distorted from reality.In the case of Workday, there are significant reasons why this company continues to defy skeptics and does not offer enough reward for an investor to short the stock. To start with, Workday is seeing significant revenue growth. As the company reported today, quarterly revenue grew over 60% on a YoY basis. Is growth slowing? Yes. Does this matter? No. Again it pains me to say this, but Workday is providing a cloud based solution in an addressable market that is estimated could be as large as $70B by 2015. If the company captures just a 10% slice of that market, sales could grow to $7B. While they face formidable competition from companies such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Workday is the hot name in the space right now and does not face legacy systems baggage that comes with a company like Oracle.Workday also has some pretty heavy hitters as major stock holders. To start with, the founders of Workday are big players. These same two men founded PeopleSoft, which was purchased by Oracle years ago. Today, they control over 60% of the outstanding shares of Workday. Additionally, in April of this year, a notable hedge fund made a splash by picking up close to a 10% stake in the company. This was after the valuation of Workday was already sky high in the eyes of many. This is a company with a small float of shares available to be traded. Additionally, the lock up period related to the IPO has come and gone. This is typically a time when new shares hit the market and can be a negative catalyst for a high flying company like Workday.Finally, the financial performance of the company today shows the inherent leverage in the business model. Per the Q1 earnings release today, Workday reported $17M of positive operating cash flow on just over $90M in earnings. This is not that common for companies in their infancy, to generate operating cash flow that is equal to over 18% of revenue. Consider that Workday already has a product that can be sold as it is today. Incremental costs will be tied directly to incremental revenue in the future. If Workday is able to continue successfully growing its top line, the cash flow generating power of this company will be enormous. The company already sits on over $800M in cash from its IPO. If you consider that the company is already in a position where they will be generating cash on an annual basis, the valuation will begin to look more reasonable when you net out the cash on the balance sheet, and value the company based on future cash flows.Resist the urge. I have it myself and it is like a fever some days. I want to short a stock like Workday so badly. The problem is those big boys buying Workday are willing to hold onto this stock for a long time. You might get lucky trying to short a company like this, but the chances are that in the long run, the deep pocketed owners and hedge funds will win this battle.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1533862,51452,2013-07-03T13:33:42-04:00,,"Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is the leading pure play cloud computing company focused on providing human resource (HR) services. It has the only HR cloud service built on modern object oriented database technology. This compares to the 1970s era relational database technology still employed by Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), its principal competitor. Oracle's relational database technology was developed at a time when local storage was expensive and scarce so the amount of space available for each record was highly constrained by the total size of the rows and columns in the database. Oracle has modified its database somewhat with its latest 12C version but some are calling the result ""fake cloud.""By contrast, Workday's object oriented database technology on which its HR cloud offering runs has far fewer constraints and can make use of the efficiencies available by storing employee and other HR records in the cloud storage provided by Workday to its customers. A major advantage of this is being able to have employee records for every point in time, including all the changes and events that occur over time.To date, most of Workday's customers are mid-size organizations with up to 100,000 employees. But increasingly, Workday is competing with Oracle at larger customers as well. These large organizations are where Oracle is strongest.One sign of how Workday is a ""new tech"" company taking market share from the ""old tech"" Oracle is there is a continual flow of employees from Oracle to Workday and very few from Workday to Oracle. One reason for this is Workday is a very employee-focused company and is considered a great place to work.Recall, Workday was founded by the former management of PeopleSoft after Oracle acquired PeopleSoft in a hostile takeover eight years ago by raising the price until institutional shareholders decided to sell.Workday is viewed as an exciting place to work in Silicon Valley with many highly skilled people seeking employment there. But it is challenged enough to find top quality cloud-experienced software engineers that it is just one of many companies that could benefit from passage of the pending immigration bill being considered in Washington. That passage would provide many additional visas so that companies like Workday could hire more immigrant engineers from places like India.As is the case with most high growth businesses, there are points of controversy relative to Workday. But the company also has many strengths and the opportunity to build a much larger company in the fast growing cloud-computing sector. Cloud computing and Big Data are the principal growth areas within the overall quite flat global enterprise IT marketplace.Workday shares do carry the kind of mid-teens multiple to revenues valuation afforded to the highest potential, fastest growing companies with the potential to become multiple times larger. The company is still in the early stages of exploiting the global cloud-based HR and financials market opportunities. And with only 172 million outstanding shares, if revenues over the next several years continue to grow at 50% per year, in 3+ years earnings could approach $4.00 per share assuming 30% operating margins and a 20% tax rate. In its April FQ1, Workday revenues increased 61% YTY and 12% sequentially. At today's $64 stock price, the current P/E on those potential calendar 2017 earnings is reasonable.And the valuation is perhaps quite conservative if Workday is highly successful with its new cloud-based financials offerings for that market that is much larger than the HR market. Many of its customers are highly interested in what Workday is promising in the financials area, especially the mid to larger-size companies. In fact, Workday almost has to perform as it sometimes closes HR deals with assurances to clients that it will soon provide the cloud-based financials it is beginning to introduce.Workday is an excellent example of what we look for in a high growth company in a hot new sector like cloud computing. It meets many of the criteria described in our recent article ""Technology Stock Investing - Keys To Success."" It is on several major new product cycles with innovative technologies that address large markets. And it is still early in its global expansion. And this management has a proven track record.Workday shares have performed well and we expect them to continue to do so over coming quarters and years. They are up 128% from the $28 IPO price last October, up 28% from where they traded the first day following the IPO and up 16% since their recent low April 10th, the day the IPO lock up released. Workday shares did decline in front of that lock up release, but when the employee and investor selling turned out to be modest, rebounded nicely.This appreciation from the IPO lock up release date is quite typical with high quality, high growth companies with very positive outlooks. We suggest keeping this in mind relative to future IPO lock up releases of high potential companies. Especially if the total shares outstanding is modest like is the case with Workday.Typical of the most innovative ""new tech"" companies, there is hidden value for shareholders in that there are likely many new things in development that will come to market that cannot be seen from outside the company today.I recommend purchase of Workday shares in growth portfolios.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1479481,48501,2013-06-04T10:07:11-04:00,,"The information technology industry is shifting towards cloud computing as a way to lower the cost of ownership for enterprises. Servers and other infrastructure are being replaced by the ""as-a-service"" models. Companies can now pay for infrastructure, platforms, and software when they need them. This movement is allowing firms, government organizations, and education providers, to improve efficiency and refocus their IT department's efforts toward key strategic decisions.Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) stands to benefit from the move to cloud computing. The enterprise primarily offers Human Resource Management and Financial Management solutions to enterprises. That said, the technology sector is notoriously competitive. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), SAP AG (NYSE:SAP), Ultimate Software Group (NASDAQ:ULTI), Concur Technologies (NASDAQ:CNQR), and NetSuite (NYSE:N) are among the key competitors vying for market share in the fast growing cloud computing market.Workday is well positioned in the industry and is gaining key customers. The firm is taking market share from larger rivals Oracle and SAP. Workday appears to have what it takes to compete in the technology sector. Thus, investors should accumulate shares during declines in value.Constructing a Peer GroupA peer group is a group of companies engaged in similar business activities whose economics and valuations are influenced by closely related factors. A peer group consist of companies that derive a substantial portion of their revenue and operating profit from similar business activities. The companies in the peer group should face a similar demand environment; they should not be exposed to different stages of the business cycle. Companies in a peer group also have similar cost structures and access to financial capital.In some aspects Workday can be compared with Oracle. Both firms offer Human Capital Management [HCM] and Financial Management [FM] solutions. One key difference between the firms is that Oracle also competes in servers and storage while Workday is strictly a software company. Another difference that makes the comparison less meaningful is that Oracle has significantly more exposure to the global economy than Workday. Thus, some comparison between the two companies would be of limited use. Readers should note the use of the words ""some"" and ""limited.""SAP is another firm that could be included in the same peer group as Workday. The firms offer solutions designed for HCM and FM challenges. SAP is the larger firm and has a more a diversified, broader, product portfolio. Unlike Oracle, SAP is not in the server and storage industries; SAP competes in the software industry. Additionally, SAP is more exposed to the global economy than Workday. Consequently, some comparisons between Workday and SAP would be of limited use.Ultimate Software Group (NYSE:USG) is in the peer group with Workday. Both firms deliver solutions for HRM to customers in the U.S. and Canada. USG provides cloud-based solutions to small businesses and enterprises with over 1,000 employees. Some of USG's product offerings include Human Resource Management, Benefits Administration and Payroll Administration. USG had a market capitalization of $3 billion while Workday had a consolidated market capitalization of roughly $10 billion, both as of the time of writing. USG and Workday have similar operating activities, allowing for more meaningful comparisons.Ceridian is also in the same peer group as Workday, but Ceridian is not a public company. Consequently, Ceridian is not subject the same reporting requirements as Workday and will not be used as a comparison company.Infor is a competitor of Workday that provides a broad array of enterprise software solutions. Infor does not compete in the hardware industry; thus, Infor and Workday are comparable. In the nine months ended February 28, 2013, Infor reported revenue of almost $2 billion. Readers should note that Infor derives a substantial portion of its revenue from outside of the U.S. and Canada.ADP also competes in HRM and broadly enterprise applications.Concur Technologies, Inc. is a leading provider of integrated travel and expense management solutions for companies of all industries, sizes and geographies. Concur competes with Workday in expense management and is a suitable peer company comparison. Again, readers should note that Concur has international exposure, but Workday is attempting to expand globally.NetSuite Inc. is a leading vendor of cloud computing business management software suites. NetSuite and Workday compete in FM. Also, Netsuite had a consolidated market capitalization of about $6.5 billion on 12 trailing months sales of $331 million while Workday reported 12 trailing months revenue of $309 million. NetSuite is a suitable peer company comparison.In summary:Forecast FinancialsWorkday's revenue is expected to grow to $439 million this year and $664 million during 2014, which implies 60.6 percent and 51 percent sales growth rates. The street is also forecasting gross margin expansion to 64.2 percent in 2014. Also, the EBITDA loss is forecast to shrink to about 14 percent of revenue. The net loss in 2014 could be about 19 percent of revenue.In the 12 months ending September 30, 2013, the street is expecting Concur's revenue to grow 22.8 percent and 24.4 percent in 2014. Revenue could reach $672 million in 2014. The EBITDA margin is expected to expand to the low 20s and the net income margin is forecast to increase to roughly 10 percent.For the 12 months ending December 31, 2013, NetSuite's revenue is forecast to grow 32 percent to $407 million. In 2014, revenue is forecast to grow 27.4 percent to $519 million. The EBITDA margin is forecast to grow to 52 percent in 2014 and the net income margin could expand to 34 percent.The forecasts suggest NetSuite and Concur will be profitable while Workday appears to be continuing expenditure meant to maintain sales growth. Of the three firms discussed thus far, Workday is forecast to have the highest sales growth rate.Ultimate Software Group's revenue is forecast to grow to $409 million in the 12 months ending December 31, 2013, a 23 percent increase. Revenue could grow to $500 million in 2014, a 22.5 percent increase. The EBITDA margin forecast is for growth to about 20 percent and the net income margin is expected to increase to 11 percent.Comparable data for Infor is not available as the firm is not yet a publicly traded company.Of the firms covered thus far, the forecast is for Workday to have the highest sales growth rate. Oracle and SAP will be included in this section to add depth to the analysis.In the 12 months ending May 31, 2013, Oracle is expected to post revenue growth of 0.9 percent. In 2014, revenue is expected to grow 5.7 percent to $39.6 billion. Oracle's EBITDA margin could increase to about 50 percent and the net income margin could expand to 35.4 percent.SAP is expected to post a revenue decline of 14.7 percent in the 12 months ending December 31, 2013. Revenue could increase 10.2 percent to $19.7 billion in 2014. The EBITDA margin could come in around 35 percent and the net income margin could be about 23 percent.The smaller firms could be taking some market share from Oracle and SAP. Based on the forecasts, Workday appears to be the best positioned to increase market share.ValuationsWDAY Price / Book Value data by YChartsOn a price/sales basis, Workday is overvalued relative to Concur, and USG; NetSuite is trading at 19 times sales while Workday is trading at 17.4 times sales (as of the time of writing). On a price/book basis, Workday is overvalued relative to Concur. On a price/cash flow basis, Workday is overvalued relative to all three firms. Given the growth rate of Workday, the valuation is not too high for a growth company. SAP and Oracle are overvalued relative to the S&P 500.From a short-term valuation perspective, Workday is trading off its recent peak valuation. The valuation may consolidate for a couple months. This would be a good time for investors to start looking for decent entry spots. Workday has been growing at a rate above the industry, including some key competitors. That speaks to the quality of the company's products and character of leadership.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1459231,25120,2013-05-24T07:16:53-04:00,,"Shares of Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) traded with sizable gains duringThursday's trading session. The provider of cloud-based human capital applications reported its first quarter results for its fiscal 2014 on Wednesday after the close.Halfway during the trading session, shares traded with gains of 4%, just above the $68 mark. At these premium valuations I remain bearish on the prospects for the company due to the extremely high valuation.First Quarter ResultsWorkday generated first quarter revenues of $91.6 million, up 61% on the year before. Subscription revenues came in at $68.4 million, up 85% on the year. Revenues rose 12.4% compared to fourth quarter revenues of $81.5 million. Revenues came in ahead of consensus estimates of $86.9 millionNet losses continued to increase. Workday reported a $33.0 million net loss. This compares to a loss of $20.3 million in the first quarter of last year and a $30.9 million loss in the past quarter. Net losses came in at $0.20 per share.Adjusted losses came in at $0.15 per share, while analysts on average were looking for losses of $0.18 per share.During the quarter, Workday added some high profile customers including Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) and Levi Strauss for its human capital management applications. The company remains upbeat about its products, the pipeline and future growth.A Detailed Look Through The Income StatementDespite the significant revenue growth, signs of positive operating leverage are limited. Cost of revenue rose ""merely"" by 46.3%, thereby falling by 410 basis points to 40.0% of total revenues.These margin improvements were largely undone as Workday boosted its Research & Developmen spending by 74.6%, increasing investments by 300 basis points to 39.6% of total revenues.Sales and marketing expenses fell by 190 basis points to 41.8% of total revenues. These gains were made undone by a 340 basis points increase in general and administrative expenses which rose to 14.1% of total revenues.Workday remains committed to R&D investments to offer superior services. The relative large investments explain the net losses to a great extent.Looking Into The Second Quarter, And Remainder Of The YearFor the current second quarter, Workday expects revenues to come in between $97 and $101 million, up 55 to 61% on the year before. At the midpoint of the range, revenues are expected to increase by 8.1% compared to the first quarter. The guidance is in line with analysts expectations for second quarter revenues of $99.0 million.The company has raised its full year revenue target to $425-$440 million. This implies that revenues in the second half of the year could come in around $240 million, up from last year's $154 million. Workday raised its full year revenue guidance by $5 million, bringing it in line with consensus estimates of $433.2 million in annual revenues.ValuationWorkday ended its first quarter with $806 million in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. Other than a modest amount in capital lease obligations, Workday does not operate with any debt, for a solid net cash position.Factoring in the 4% gains in Thursday's trading session, the market values Workday at $11.3 billion. This values operating assets of the firm at around $10.5 billion, the equivalent of 24 times its expected fiscal revenues for the year of 2014.Given the lack of profitability, Workday is currently not paying a dividend.Some Historical PerspectiveLike many cloud-based names, Workday only got its public listing quite recently. Shares were eventually sold to the public at $28 per share in a highly successful offering. Shares instantly jumped to $50 per share, to trade in a $50-$60 trading range in the following months. Shares kept on rallying throughout the start of 2013 hitting upon highs of $69 at the moment.The main reason behind the premium valuation is the incredibly high revenue growth. Revenues quadrupled between its fiscal 2010 and 2013, from merely $68.1 million to $273.7 million. At the same time net losses more than doubled to $119.8 million per annum.Investment ThesisWorkday had a solid quarter, with revenues coming in ahead of consensus estimates. Reported revenue growth slowed down to 61%, attributed to a tough comparison last year. Adjusting for the tough comparison, revenues would have grown by 75%. As such, the midpoint of second quarter revenue growth of 58% implies quite a growth slowdown compared to the first quarter.Unearned revenue increased by 41% on the year, implying that Workday has a pipeline of 10 months, based on today's revenue rates.While revenue growth is still impressive, it is slightly worrying to see the growth rates coming off that rapidly. Adjusted revenue growth is expected to fall by 16 points to 59% in the current quarter. This slowdown is even more important in light of some of the company's comments during the earnings call: ""Long-term profitability and cash flow generation are important goals but we believe that our focus today needs to be on market expansion, continued product innovation and growth.""This implies that despite a relentless focus on growth, rather than profitability, revenue growth is decelerating quite rapidly.Still Workday is positioned for growth. It has some 450 customers for its Human Resource applications at the moment, while it reckons there are more than 10,000 US companies with over a 1,000 employees. This represents a large opportunity for the company.Workday continues to compete against the likes of SAP and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) which have been trying to boost their cloud-based offerings by means of acquisitions in recent years. Within the fast growing segment, Workday is well positioned. While it is smaller than these large ERP-based competitors, its growth rates are more impressive as it is growing its market share within the rapid growing segment.While the company is stabilizing its losses at the moment, achieving break-even levels seems far fetched at the moment and will most certainly not happen this year. Even if we attach a generous growth rate of 50% for its fiscal 2015 annual revenues, shares are valued at 16 times next year's annual revenues, with at best having visibility for break-even results.Therefore I remain on the short side, purely based on valuation concerns.Disclosure: I am short WDAY.

1332921,22445,2013-04-10T14:27:22-04:00,,"I assume you all know the classic work of one of the greatest historians of all time, Plutarch's Parallel Lives. Written in the first century A.D., this is a classic work that has both ethical and historic value. The work describes the parallel lives of some very famous Greek and Roman individuals.If you have not heard, one former Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) employee and shareholder is suing Zynga's management. Ethan Wohl, partner at Wohl & Fruchter says directors aren't supposed to favor their own interest and they should treat other shareholders the way they treat themselves, unless they have a really good reason to do otherwise. So I guess the principle of pari passu somewhat applies to stock lockups also.The fact that this former employee was not able to sell during the same period as Zynga's top brass caused her to lose money (she says).As far as why Mark Pincus and several other top level executives of Zynga excluded themselves from the lockup agreement that everyone else was subject to is not the scope of this article. They had their reasons and they will have to answer for their actions, assuming Ethan Wohl is correct, that what they did was sort of improper.My question is, what happens to a very expensive stock -- to be exact in bubble territory -- when a lockup agreement expires and insiders sell? The answer is the following chart:(Click to enlarge)According to the Bloomberg video, Mark Pincus and other executives sold the stock in the $12 range. As you can see from the above chart, the stock fell like a rock afterwards.So the next question is, what might happen to Workday's (NASDAQ:WDAY) stock, when its lockup agreement also expires? Please note that Workday is multiple times more expensive than what Zynga was, even at the highest point of the above chart.And exactly what type of lock-up expiration are we talking about? Fellow SA writer Buffett Junior explains:And if you didn't notice, today is April 10. That means that as of today, almost all restricted stockholders and or option holders are eligible sellers of Workday's stock.(Click to enlarge)The market has been anticipating the lock-up expiration for some time now and the stock has corrected a bit over the past several weeks.However, if one takes into account just how expensive Workday is (read all my Workday logic here), I think that Workday's stock can fall even more -- on a percentage basis -- than what Zynga did.One thing is for sure, short sellers are rubbing their hands and are shorting every single stock they can get their hands on.http://www.nasdaq.com/Bottom lineWill Workday's stock have the same faith -- a parallel life -- as Zynga's stock? I think so. As to when the stock might correct is not easy to tell. One thing I can tell you, this stock is so expensive, I wouldn't buy it even with your money.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1322591,22202,2013-04-05T04:20:00-04:00,,"Workday's (NASDAQ:WDAY) stock price has defied gravity since its IPO. This is likely to change on April 10, 2013 when its IPO lock-up expires. Currently, there are 25.5 million shares in the float (source: Bloomberg). On Workday's March 7, 2013 earnings call, the CFO (Mark Peek) said, ""Approximately 63 million shares, including more than 14 million exercisable stock options not currently included in our share count, will be available to trade after the lockup expires. These totals exclude shares held by insiders and those subject to Rule 144."" Doing the math, the float could increase almost 250% over the next few trading days. With this much supply potentially coming onto the market, the price of the stock is likely to decline.There is a critical distinction between a ""good company"" and a ""good stock."" Rational people can argue whether or not Workday is a good company, but over the next 1-2 weeks, WDAY is unlikely to be a good stock. The stock price is likely to sharply decline over the next week due to the flood of shares coming to market. It is likely current holders may trim or exit their positions in front of the lock-up release and it is likely hedge funds will establish short positions into the lock-up release. Both of these dynamics will likely depress the share price heading into April 10th.Since January 1, 2013 WDAY has traded an average of 507,400 shares daily. The 63 million shares unlocking equal over 124 days of average trading volume. While these metrics are concerning, one needs to understand whether employees and holders subject to the lock-up are likely to sell on or around April 10. Refer to the CFO's quote above once more. The 63 million shares coming unlocked on April 10 do NOT include any shares held by insiders. Hence, most of the holders that are unlocking are regular employees and their WDAY stock is likely to be the vast majority of their net worth. I believe any rational person that has been restricted from selling his/her shares due to the IPO lock-up would be eager to cash-in given Workday's unsustainable valuation.ValuationBy any valuation metric, Workday is extremely expensive. Some refer to Workday as the poster child of the SaaS bubble. There are 161.9 million shares currently outstanding. The number of shares outstanding is likely to increase. From the Company's March 7 conference call, ""Due to the large number of exercisable options becoming available in April, we are not providing share count guidance for the quarter."" To be conservative, I will only use the 161.9 million shares currently outstanding for valuation purposes.Workday is valued at an enterprise value of $8.77 billion. While the Company's revenue growth is strong, WDAY has been unable to convert any of its revenue into positive EBITDA, FCF or EPS. All three of these metrics are negative. We are talking about a company with an enterprise value of $8.77 billion that will continue to be EBITDA negative for years to come. Seriously, bubble much?? Given that Workday will be EBITDA, FCF and EPS negative for the next 2-3+ years (depending on the metric), we are left to perform comparable analysis using EV/Revenue multiples. Though there are numerous deficiencies in using this metric due to different margin and growth profiles, it is the best we can do. Here is a comp table provided by Jefferies.Looking at the comps, companies with positive EBITDA and FCF are trading at a mean 2013 EV/Revenue multiple of 6.8x that is approximately 1/3 of WDAY's. The closest comps from a financial and growth perspective appear to be ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and Cornerstone (NASDAQ:CSOD) given these companies are expected to grow revenue 46% and 39% respectively (compared to WDAY's 52% expected revenue growth) in 2014. NOW and CSOD trade at an average of 7.1x 2013 EV/Revenue vs. WDAY's 20.2x 2013 EV/EBITDA. From a market cap perspective, Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and NetSuite (NYSE:N) are closest, but both companies are EPS and FCF positive. It is hard to argue WDAY deserves a valuation premium to either of these companies, yet CRM trades at 6.3X 2013 EV/EBITDA and N trades at 13.5x 2013 EV/EBITDA. Go figure.Even though WDAY is both EBITDA and FCF negative, if WDAY were to trade in-line with the set of comparable companies at 6.8x 2013 EV/EBITDA, WDAY would trade at $23.00. Further, if we assume the 14 million options that are exercisable as of April 10 are exercised, WDAY's share count would increase to 175.9 million shares outstanding and its EV/Revenue metrics would go even higher. Either way, WDAY is priced at a super-premium to other comps. This fact is not lost on the holders of WDAY's 63 million shares about to be released from their lock-up.Given the potential 250% increase in the float that could hit the market in the coming days and WDAY's unsustainable valuation, I expect to see significant selling on/around April 10th and the stock to pull back to the high $40s or low $50s. I recommend shorting the shares into the lock-up expiration.Disclosure: I am short WDAY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1309471,37171,2013-03-29T20:25:09-04:00,,"I first heard of Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) last year when the company went public and the stock jumped 74% on its first day of trading. I immediately decided to do an analysis on the company to see what the excitement was all about. Almost six months have passed since the IPO, and I am still asking myself the same question.This stock is certainly among the most expensive since the dot-com bubble. Regardless of the valuation metric used, the price simply does not make sense. Typically, a rich valuation means that investors are expecting high future growth from the company. However, in this particular case, Workday would need to achieve truly astonishing growth and profitability in order to justify the current price.I have talked to many investors who are bullish on this stock. According to them, ""the company's products are amazing!"" That might very well be the case. However, as Buffett once said: ""price is what you pay, value is what you get."" No matter how great a products is, nothing is worth an infinite price. It is for this reason why this article will mostly focus on valuation. I will attempt to prove why I believe Workday is good short candidate at the current price.Profitability and Financial HealthWhen it comes to financial health, Workday gets a passing grade. The company has over $790 million in cash and marketable securities (87% of it raised through the IPO). The company has minimal debt (capital leases of approximately $25 million and capitalized operating leases of approximately $44 million). In total, the company has $69 million in debt, which gives us a net cash position of $721 million. Most of the company's other liabilities (78% of total liabilities) consist of deferred revenue, which is not a true liability. Overall, the company's financial position is solid and I do not expect it to run into trouble anytime soon.While Workday's balance sheet looks excellent, the company's profitability continues to deteriorate.Note: Periods ending January 2011 and 2010 have been adjusted. Originally the annual accounting periods ended in December. For example, the period ending in January 2011 actually ended in December of 2010. However, to be consistent with the company's current accounting periods and to avoid confusion, I made this slight adjustment to the reporting dates.Although the company has achieved some impressive growth over the past few years, growing revenues at over 100% per annum, its profitability has not improved much. In fact, the amount of money the company is losing seems to be accelerating, which is not a good sign this late in the game. If the company keeps burning through cash at this rate, it will be forced to raise additional funds by selling more shares (causing dilution) or by taking on more debt (increasing risk).What is Workday Worth?As of this writing, Workday had a market capitalization of $10.4 billion and an enterprise value of approximately $9.7 billion. Over the past four years the company has lost a cumulative of $271 million (owner earnings), and the losses appear to be accelerating. In the most recent year, the company had revenues of $274 million, giving us a price to sales ratio of 38x. Yes, that is no typo... currently, investors are willing to pay 38x sales for this stock! It does not matter how bright the future is for this company, this valuation is ridiculous. In fact, it could take Workday over a decade of double-digit growth in order to justify the current price, and that is if everything goes according to plan (very unlikely).I am usually skeptical of looking at projected earnings and revenue growth; however, it is possible to use simple forecasting to show that a stock is overvalued. I will do a simple example to show that Workday would need to achieve unprecedented long-term growth and profitability in order to justify the current price. Again, I want to remind readers that the following example is simply to show how crazy the valuation is. In no way do I believe that Workday will be able to achieve this. For simplicity, we will ignore the time value of money in the example.I forecast revenues to increase at 50% on a five-year CAGR basis. I also forecast profit margins to average around 50% during the five-year forecast period. This means that at the end of year five, Workday will have revenues of $2.1 billion and earnings of just over $1 billion. Assuming that the enterprise value remains the same ($9.7 billion), it will give us a forward earnings yield of about 10.8%, or a forward enterprise value to earnings ratio of 9.2x. The price to sales ratio (assuming market cap does not change) would be 5x.The simple example above might look ridiculous to some, but I only did it to show that the current valuation is irrational. Workday will need to achieve truly phenomenal growth and profitability in order to deserve a $10.4 billion market capitalization. Investors betting on this are taking on too much risk, in my opinion.Lock-up ExpirationThe lock-up period expires April 10th, 2013. In fact, almost all of the outstanding shares will be eligible for sale. It is important to mention that the company has two classes of common stock. There are currently 26.2 million Class A shares, which are allowed to be freely traded. However, there are another 140.2 million Class B shares that are currently restricted from resale as a result of market standoff and lock-up agreements. The Class B shares are convertible to Class A shares and will become available to be sold on April 10th. In addition, approximately 21.0 million options will also be exercisable upon the lock-up expiration.As should be plainly obvious, the market will be flooded with an enormous amount of shares. Since the stock is so grossly overvalued, I believe that there will be substantial selling by insiders (at least by the smart ones).ConclusionIt should be apparent to most rational investors that this stock is grossly overpriced. The company will need to achieve some pretty spectacular results in order to justify the current valuation. Since the lock-up expiration is coming up in a few weeks, I believe that there will be substantial selling by insiders, which could cause the shares to plunge. Shrewd investors can take advantage of this by shorting the stock.Disclosure: I am short WDAY. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1283381,24888,2013-03-18T13:10:15-04:00,,"To answer the question right away: I think so.As I tried to point out in a previous article, I believe that Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is a contemporary example of irrational exuberance, not seen since the bursting of the dot.com bubble.In Workday's latest earnings call the company forecasted annual revenues as follows:""For the year we anticipate total revenue of $420 million to $435 million or growth of 53% to 59%.""However, if we look at revenue over the last four quarters, we see that revenue growth is not accelerating. The company did not manage to add more than $10 million revenue each quarter. This means that in percentage the growth is actually decelerating, rather than accelerating. In order to reach its revenue target the company needs to add more than $10 million in each of the next four quarters.I see no reason why this should happen, given the past performance. Moreover Workday targets large companies as customers. These companies are mostly standardized on Workday's giant competitors like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and SAP (NYSE:SAP), which increasingly offer good cloud alternatives to Workday's products. I believe it will therefore prove more and more difficult to convince these companies to switch to the smaller, and thus riskier Workday, as the costs to switch to a new vendor are gigantic for large companies.Guidance for the current quarter is not encouraging either. In fact, less than $10 million revenue growth is projected by management:""we expect total revenues for the first quarter to be within a range of $83 million to $87 million...""The midpoint of that range, $85 million, adds less than $4 million to last quarter's revenue of $81.5 million, well shy of the $10 million added in the previous quarters.But let's stay optimistic and assume that Workday could keep the pace of adding 10 million revenue over each of the next four quarters. This would break down as follows:Q1 $90 millionQ2 $100 millionQ3 $110 millionQ4 $120 millionThis optimistic scenario, assuming no economic headwinds, totals to $420 million, the bottom of their revenue target range, which will be considered a miss.Add to this that Workday is currently valued at 25 times that forward revenue (38 times trailing revenue), which makes Workday the most overvalued technology stock on Wall Street with a market cap above $1 billion. There is simply no other technology stock with a market cap above $1 billion and a price to sales ratio above 22. ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARMH) and Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) come close, but ARMH is very profitable and Splunk is nearing break even. Yet these companies are considered very expensive at these levels. Add to that the fact that Workday projects to increase its net operating loss (a whopping $119 million over the past year):""We do not currently expect margin improvement and in fact you should expect our operating loss to increase as we continue to invest.""Plus the fact that the lockup period expires on April 10, and it is safe to expect that the odds for disappointment far outweigh the odds for pleasant surprises.Disclosure: I am short WDAY.

1057691,22445,2012-12-11T13:44:01-05:00,,"Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) was introduced to me by a fellow commentator, asking me to comment on it when I wrote an article about Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). I have to admit -- I thought I had seen it all. I thought I had seen every type of bubble stock possible. I thought there was nothing on earth that can surprise me anymore. Well, I was wrong. When I reviewed Workday, I was totally blown away.Workday provides enterprise cloud-based applications for companies on a subscription basis. Workday belongs to a new type of space called SaaS or, software as a subscription. There are many companies in this space and they are all valued for perfection. In the case of Workday, however, that is an understatement.I will give the company the benefit of the doubt and say that this is a great name. But the question is: How much should investors pay for it?Price/sales, one of the metrics I look at most, stands at 34! I think this might be a new record. I don't recall ever coming across a stock that sells for so many times its revenue. Price/book stands at a mindboggling 13. Trailing P/E is negative as well as the forward P/E -- in other words, the company is not expected to make any money even in the next 12 months.Revenue (NYSE:TTM) stands at $235 million with revenue increasing by 100% year over year. I hate to be a spoiled sport -- while revenue growth is indeed important, it's just not that important to value a company 34 times its revenue.Click to enlarge images.Now, let's look at the income statement (the above chart). As per the company's latest Q3 report, total revenue for the third quarter was $72 million, with total costs and expenses running at $113 million, giving us a loss of $41 million for the quarter. For the nine months ending Oct. 31, the company had revenues of $192 million, with total costs and expenses coming in at $279 million, for a grand total loss of $88 million.If I am going to pay 35 times sales for any company, the least I expect from it is to be profitable. But as is evident from the above data, this company starts out with losing money, even before spending a dime on anything else. It has negative gross margins. In fact, it has never earned a dime. Profit margins stand at -47% and operating margin at -43%.Looking at the balance sheet (see above), the company has about $881 million in current assets, but that's only because it recently completed its IPO raising of about $685 million. If we subtract the recent $685 million hot IPO money from the $950 million in total assets, we get $265 million, which is less than the $334 million the company has in total liabilities. Had this IPO not been consummated, the company would probably be a questionable going concern.A big round of applause to the underwriters of this deal (Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs). I have no idea how they persuaded people to buy into this company, but they deserve their salary. That not being enough, this stock was one of the IPO darlings of the year. On the very first day of trading, the stock jumped 75% from its IPO price. While I understand how underwriters can market any stock to their clients and persuade them to buy in, how they persuaded the whole market to follow up and bid this stock even higher on the first day of trading is beyond me.The SAAS ModelMany people have tried to find some sort of new valuation model for SaaS companies. Many claim that SaaS companies should be valued differently. Do you remember the 1990s dot-com bubble? Let me refresh your memory. During the late '90s the market was valuing stocks to the moon and analysts had no explanation for it, so they invented explanations. All of a sudden, you had analysts claiming that a company with almost no sales had a value of X, because another set of companies that were in the same space had a similar valuation. I don't remember who it was, but one analyst even used the number of clicks as a valuation metric.Of course, when everything blew up in everybody's face, out went all those exotic ideas of the new valuation norm. As far as I'm concerned, we have the same situation here. We have analysts trying to find ways to value WDAY at 35 times sales, with zero earnings (and no earning in sight, in fact), never having made a dime.I'm sorry folks, but I don't buy the whole SaaS notion one bit. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) have been subscription-based businesses forever, and I don't see them trading at 35 time sales.Workday is not the only SaaS darling trading for pie in the sky multiples. Others in the space include Cornerstone OnDemand (NASDAQ:CSOD), NetSuite (NYSE:N), Saba Software (OTCPK:SABA) , Ultimate Software (NASDAQ:ULTI), and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM).All of these stocks are on cloud nine. Don't get me wrong. I am all for speculation, but when I speculate, I like to have some leverage on my side -- for example, a stock with no earnings but a very low price/sales ratio and the potential for decent earnings in the future. In the case of Workday we have an extremely expensive stock, trading at a crazy price/sales multiple, and no clue as to when it will make a profit.Shorts Are Already Piling UpAs per Yahoo Finance, about 6.4% of the float has already been sold short. This is not a small number, considering the time frame this stock has been trading in. And in my opinion, this will be one of the most shorted stocks in the entire market in a few months.WDAY Is Definitely a Short CandidateAfter I decide that the fundamentals warrant a short position, I look for weak technicals to find an entry point.But Workday's chart does not give us any clues, as the stock has only recently started trading. So you can either wait for technical weakness, or short at will, as the market has been doing for the past months.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Workday is a leader of SaaS-based enterprise solutions for global human resource management systems (HRMS). Workday's strong HR functionality and SaaS technology platform makes it the fastest-growing company in pure-play SaaS solutions. Quarter-to-quarter revenue growth is impressive for investors. Workday stock is up $3.86, or 6.7%, to $61.48. Pacific Crest analyst Brendan Barnicle noted Workday could be worth as much as $15 billion with the addressable market at $50 billion now, growing to more than $70 billion by 2015.Day's Range: 57.31 - 58.9352-week Range: 45.05 - 65.00Volume:803,479Avg Vol (3m): 498,838Market Cap: 9.73BP/E: N/AEPS: -1.62Div & Yield: N/AHRMS applications consist of business process and analytics. These applications range from employee life cycle: hiring and onboarding, personnel and benefits administration, compensation, payroll, compliance, performance management, succession planning, and career development. HRMS application suites make up the largest segment of the $9.5 billion market for HRM software and account for half of its total revenue ($4.7 billion).The HRMS market has moderate growth. SaaS revenue is growing faster than HRMS at a 15% rate. Key drivers of SaaS HRMS adoption include faster implementation times and automatic software upgrades and updates. Workday is a pure-play SaaS vendor. Forrester's 69-criteria evaluation of human resource management system vendors found that Workday, Oracle PeopleSoft, Oracle E-Business Suite, and SAP are the top companies today.CompetitionOracle and SAP have their own cloud-based services to meet demand for human resources software. The acquisitions for Oracle include the buyout of Taleo for $1.9 billion. SAP acquired SuccessFactors for $3.4 billion. In 2011, SAP had 17.4 percent of the market, followed by Oracle with 12.4 percent, according to IDC. Workday had just 3.5 percent.Workday's annual profit expectations are due for January 2014 fiscal year. The company went public on October 12. The IPO raised $637 million from selling 22.5 million Class A shares, or about 14 percent of the company. In the days immediately following the sale, Workday stock jumped as high as $57, more than doubling its opening price. The company was able to hold onto most of its gains after doubling in its first four days as a public entity. Three hundred seventy mutual funds owned the stock on Dec. 31. The company's two founders own more than 60% of the stock.Workday has become an HR software leader from its cloud-based human resources management suite. The company has 350 customers. The largest is Hewlett-Packard Co. Other customers include Flextronics, Chiquita Brands International Inc., Four Seasons Hotels Inc., Kimberly-Clark Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc.Software configuration flexibility improvements in Workday's new products suite make its business model attractive for investors.

It is producing losses both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Why do I bring this up? Because at least other bubble companies make a profit on a non-GAAP basis. Not workday, they are losing money fair and square on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis.One interesting thing to note is this paragraph from the CEO's presentation:First of all, according to the company's latest 10-Q report dated November 30, 2012, there were approximately 166 million shares of the company's shares outstanding. The question is why is the company counting 162 million? I don't have an answer.As per the anti-dilutive nature of the options, there are only two ways I know that options can be anti-dilutive:But in this case, I think the CEO is saying that these options are not exercisable -- and thus don't count -- until such a time comes that the company returns to profitability (I hope on a GAAP basis). So if the company makes even a penny, shareholders can expect dilution.But then again if the 14 million options will be available for exercise after April 10, it means they can actually be sold. So I really don't understand the anti-dilutive nature of these options.However, my most important issue is not the company, not their products and not the people. I am sure the products and everybody working there are as good as they come. My beef continues to be with the valuation of this company.For the life of me, can someone please explain to me by what valuation formula or theory does any company with sales of $270 Million have the right to command a $10 billion market cap?Honestly, I would really like an analyst who follows this stock and who is recommending it to please explain how he gets his target price.Finally, the stock's float is only 26 million shares. Come April the 10th, 63 million shares and 14 million exercisable options (that are supposed to be anti-dilutive) will be available to trade.Given the stock trades at 42 times sales and does not have any earnings -- and will not have any time soon -- come April 10, do current shareholders holding this stock feel lucky?P.S. Workday is so expensive, it makes the other SaaS stocks in the space: Cornerstone OnDemand (NASDAQ:CSOD), NetSuite (NYSE:N), Saba Software (OTCPK:SABA), Ultimate Software (NASDAQ:ULTI), and Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), look cheap.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1038381,21820,2012-11-30T13:06:23-05:00,,"On Wednesday, enterprise cloud-based company Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) reported its first public earnings report (you can read the call transcript here). The company's third quarter showed strong revenue growth and gave investors a peak beyond the IPO to see where the company is headed in the future. I highlighted Workday's recent IPO and encouraged investors to ""Buy Into This IPO For The Long-Term Growth."" Hopefully, today's earnings report highlighted that growth.Revenue increased 99% to hit $72.6 million in the third quarter. Subscription revenue came in at $51.6 million, an increase of 116%. The company reported a non-GAAP net loss of $23.9 million, representing earnings per share of -$0.39.Chairman and co-founder Aneel Bhusri had this to say about the company's first public quarter:Here is a look at how total revenue has increased over the last two years:Cash and cash equivalents rose during the quarter, due to the recent IPO. Workday had $797.4 million as of Oct. 31, after receiving proceeds of $684.6 million from the IPO. Unearned revenue increased 64% to $252.2 million.New customers continue to increase for Workday. Around the time of Workday's IPO, the company had 340 customers. In the third quarter, the company added key customers including DuPont, Johnson Controls, Yale University, J.B. Hunt, and Hewlett-Packard. In total, the company added 31 customers in the third quarter and now has a total of 356 at quarter's end. One key thing to point out is how Workday counts its revenue from customers. In a multiyear deal, which is the majority of contracts from Workday, the first year revenue is listed in the unearned revenue.I mentioned in my IPO writeup on Workday that several key new applications could be a reason to buy shares, as customers will increase along with revenue. In August, Workday rolled out a new attendance application called Workday Time Tracking. Two new applications were announced during the third-quarter earnings call. Workday Big Data Analytics will roll out in the second half of 2013. Workday Recruiting will roll out in the first half of 2014. The company hopes both of these applications provide more reasons to choose Workday.Workday expects fourth-quarter revenue to hit $75 million to $79 million, of which $56 million to $58 million will be from subscription revenue. This marks a 74%-83% year-over-year increase for total revenue. Analysts on Yahoo Finance are calling for revenue of $63.97 in the fourth quarter and earnings per share of -$0.59. For the fiscal year, analysts see the company posting a net loss of -$1.49 per share and revenue of $253.79 million.Since Workday's IPO, shares have traded between $45.05 and $57.21. Shares shot up on Wednesday in the after-hours trading session after the earnings report. Workday shares have since retreated and now trade at $50.43. Shares originally priced at $28 for their IPO, after two previous ranges of $21-$24 and $24-$26. Strong demand raised the offering price and also caused shares to soar in their first publicly traded day. I continue to like Workday going forward with its minimal international exposure and opportunity for growth, growing sequential revenue, and new applications. If shares drop below $50, you should consider buying and holding.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in WDAY over the next 72 hours.

This is Workday's first quarter as a publicly traded company. Sales rose an amazing 99%! Analysts congratulated Workday five times during their conference call on delivering a phenomenal quarter. You know what? I'm going to congratulate them as well. This was a marvelous quarter.And I think you should short Workday despite their fine results.So far, I've been correct in my assessment: I suggested Workday would go down once investors saw the quarter. The stock dropped almost 3% In response to earnings, the stock dropped almost 3% - on a day when the Nasdaq rose 0.7%. This stock isn't done going down.Even fantastic quarters can't be enough to support Workday's nonsensical valuation. Workday after all trades at a P/S of 31 if the company achieves its fourth quarter outlook. Its market cap is $8.3 billion despite having only $73 million of sales this quarter. Note that's sales, not earnings.The company's growth is actually decelerating. While 99% is astounding, it's decidedly less than the 118% growth it saw for the previous two quarters. And it's nowhere near the 294% and 170% year-over-year growth it saw in 2009 and 2010.It gets worse. Workday is guiding 74 to 83% revenue growth next quarter, which would represent yet a further slowdown in growth.At this rate, sales will grow at a 50% clip in 2013. Workday would then make $411 million of revenue. If every penny of revenue dropped to the bottom line, its PE would be 21.Of course, that isn't going to happen. In fact, the company lost 88 million during the first 9 months of this year. Workday isn't going to be profitable anytime in the near future.Further, Workday hinted in its conference call that future quarters might see a sequential drop in billings. Sounds a lot like sales might get hit as well and not show the hyper growth investors are counting on.Workday will give Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP) a run for their money. Like many SaaS companies, Workday is transforming how software is delivered. All that doesn't matter: As a stock, this great company is absurdly overvalued.Workday at $51 is like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) priced at $4000. The market put the wrong sticker price on Workday. Growth investors wrongly figured Workday would keep doubling its revenue and gave it an astronomical valuation. It's time for a markdown.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

I used to do that with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM).Hot off an IPO launch, Workday has a market cap of $8.1 billion yet has no earnings and sales more typical of small cap stocks. Next to Workday, Salesforce appears conservatively valued.Get a load of this:Despite Salesforce having sales that are twelve times as large as Workday, Salesforce's market cap is only two-and-a-half times Workday's. What makes Workday get a higher valuation than Salesforce?Then it hit me. Workday might be a younger version of Salesforce. Workday has supercharged revenue growth reminiscent of an earlier Salesforce.So I checked out ""baby"" Salesforce back in 2004 when it had a very similar yearly revenue of $176 million and a steaming 85% revenue growth. The 2004 Salesforce was the spitting image of Workday. So, how did the market value the growth rocket 2004 Salesforce? Back then, Salesforce ""only"" had a P/S of 12 - 13 with a P/CF of 86 and a much humbler $2 billion market cap.Compared to Workday, Salesforce - young or old - is a steal.Talking about steal, Workday's financial results are due November 28. With its sky-high valuation, even a minor disappointment might send shares plummeting. This stock just might plunder your investment portfolio.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1034331,25120,2012-11-29T00:12:34-05:00,,"Shares of Workday (WDAY), a leader in enterprise cloud applications for human resource and finance functions, published its third quarter results for its fiscal 2013 after the close on Wednesday. Shares gained over 1% in after hours trading, after trading with gains of up to 7%.Third Quarter ResultsWorkday reported its third quarter results, the first earnings release as a public company after being listed in October. Workday reported third quarter revenues of $72.6 million, up 99% compared to last year. Growth was driven by a 116% increase in subscription revenues which came in at $51.6 million. Revenues came in ahead of analysts estimates of $64 million.The company reported an operating loss of $40.9 million, compared to a loss of $19.4 million in the year before. Net losses came in at $41.3 million, while non-GAAP net losses increased to $23.9 million. Analysts expected the company to lose $46.6 million on a GAAP basis.Non-GAAP losses narrowed from $0.63 per share last year to a loss of $0.39 per share. Analysts expected Workday to report non-GAAP losses of $0.49 per share.OutlookFor the fourth quarter of its fiscal 2013, Workday guides for quarterly revenues of $75 to $79 million. The outlook represents a 74-83% increase in revenues year-on-year. Subscription revenues for the quarter are expected to come in between $56 and $58 million.Analysts expected Workday to guide for fourth quarter revenues of $70.5 million.ValuationWorkday ended its third quarter with $797.4 million in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company operates with roughly $27 million in capital leases, for a comfortable net cash position of roughly $770 million.For the first nine months of its fiscal 2013, Workday generated revenues of $192.1 million. The company reported a net loss of $88.1 million for the period. At this rate, Workday is on track to generate annual revenues of $269 million, on which the company is expected to lose approximately $125 million.Factoring in a 1 percent jump in after hours trading, the market values Workday at $8.6 billion. This values operating assets at roughly $7.8 billion. The valuation implies that the firm's operating assets are valued at roughly 29 times its fiscal 2013 annual revenues.Some Historical PerspectiveWorkday made its public debut in October of this year at a price of $28 per share. Shares rose 74% on their first trading day, closing around $49 per share, as demand for cloud public offerings continues.Shares rose to highs of $57 in the days after the offering before falling back towards $47 in the beginning of the month. Shares traded at lows of $49 during the regular trading session on Wednesday, but closed at $53 fueled by a late afternoon rally. In after hours trading, shares are exchanging hands at $54 per share.Investment ThesisThe public offering of Workday has been an immense success. Shares are trading at roughly double the public offer price of $28, which was already upwards revised from its initial guided price of $24-$26 per share. The company raised $637 million in its public offering.The company notes that clients are looking for other software solutions, including Workday's, when they need to upgrade existing software programs. Newly acquired customers are Johnson Controls (NYSE:JCI) and J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ:JBHT) Transportation, among others. The company continues to invest, hire and introduce new features and upgrades in the coming periods.Investors initially reacted positively, sending shares 7% higher after the company beat on revenues and earnings, and guided for a strong fourth quarter. However the pace of revenue growth is slowing down already. Third quarter revenues rose 15.8% compared to the second quarter, and revenues are expected to grow by 10.6% on a quarterly basis in the final quarter. Year-on-year revenue growth is expected to slow down from 99% in the third quarter, to 78% in the fourth quarter, based on the midpoint of the outlook.Assuming year-on-year revenue growth slows down to 75% for its fiscal 2014, and towards 50% in 2015, Workday will report revenues of approximately $700 million for the calendar year of 2014. This still values the firm at over 11 times fiscal 2015s annual revenues. The company is expected to report losses for the short to medium term. During the third quarter, Workday lost 57 cents for every dollar in revenue.I remain short, as the valuation has simply gone too far. Shares are trading with gain of just 1% in after hours trading now, and I would not be surprised to see shares in the red tomorrow as the valuation is entirely driven upon future revenue growth.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

925381,24382,2012-10-15T16:58:22-04:00,,"To put this analysis into context, I have been publishing about overvalued tech companies since March 2011, with updates in July 2011, Sep 2011, and May 2012. If you have the time to parse through those articles, you will see that I use a relatively simple screen in the Screener.co equity research platform to look for companies that are trading at EV/Revenue multiples above 10. One important trend to note is that many of the companies that once made it into this list subsequently dropped off. A small number began growing into their valuations but many were unable to sustain their lofty valuation multiples and lost a considerable percentage of their value over time.It seems that most of the companies that make up these lists are recent tech IPOs that are capturing investor enthusiasm, and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is no exception. However, it is rare even for a recent tech IPO to trade at a 70+% premium to its offer price in the first day of trading and command a market cap of $7.6B off of a ~$250M revenue run rate (multiplying the most recent quarterly revenue times 4). Making this accomplishment more stunning is that the company has reported negative earnings in each of the last four quarters. Fans of the company will point out the very impressive >100% revenue growth rate for Q2 YoY. But, expenses have grown by >50% over the same period and the market cap reported by most online services appears to exclude the future dilutive effect of the 42.5M shares of common shares reserved for future equity incentive grants, as per the S-1. With 160.2M shares currently outstanding, the incentive pool represents over 20% of the entire company's shares outstanding.Another risk factor is that Workday has issued multiple classes of common, with the company's founders being entitled to disproportionate influence over the company by virtue of the fact that their voting interests greatly exceed their economic interests in the company. It seems like these multiple-class structures are becoming increasingly common for tech IPOs since Google drew criticism for using such a structure in 2004.Only a few short years ago (before the 2008 market collapse), Software as a Service (sometimes called ""cloud"") business multiples were often ~3-5x revenue. During the recession, they actually contracted. Now, those days seem to belong to the distant past as companies like ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), Splunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) and Demandware (NYSE:DWRE) are trading at enterprise values of 17-23x revenue and even a more established, slower growing peer like Netsuite (NYSE:N) is trading at ~15x. However, even in the current context, and with impressive revenue growth, it is very hard to justify a 39.5x multiple for Workday (the highest I can find in the database and roughly twice as rich as peer companies). As one of the larger companies in the set, it might be harder for Workday to maintain its impressive growth rate over time.I do not recommend shorting high-flying IPOs given the risk that the market may remain irrational longer than any one investor can remain liquid. Even looking at long-term put options (which are not yet available for WDAY but are for other SaaS businesses with high valuations), the premiums tend to be high for this peer group. Clearly, there is a set of investors that think, as I do, that there is a substantial risk that these companies will decline materially in value. To date, I have merely avoided these companies like the plague and you might want to do the same.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

922571,22762,2012-10-14T08:01:19-04:00,,"By John ConstineCongratulations, Workday. Its share popped 74 percent when it IPOed on Friday . Or should I say condolences? $470 million ended up in the pockets  of investors instead of the cloud startup’s war chest.Meanwhile, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is called a flop for filling its coffers with $10  billion by pricing shares at nearly twice its current value. This all  raises the question: How should Silicon Valley define a successful IPO?Let’s be clear that I’m no career financial analyst, and this article  will be a simplification. But there seem to be two conflicting motives  in IPOs: raising the most money vs. displaying the most momentum.Facebook maximized the former, an asset with concrete value. To buy  out disrupters and fight off other giants like Google for top-tier  talent, it needed gobs of cash. That’s what it got.The only problem is that Facebook’s share price has sunk so low since  that it’s generating scrutiny and may be hurting team morale. People  are wary to invest in, develop on, or work for a loser, and if you look  at the NASDAQ, that’s what Facebook is.Luckily, it has natural defenses against the momentum loss. If you  work there, you build something that a billion people, most of your friends,  and maybe your Grandma use. You’re creating things that help people  connect and share. It moves fast with a declared Hacker Culture. These  make Facebook attractive to potential hires and third-party developers,  offsetting the post-IPO slump.Now let’s look at Workday. It either grossly underestimated demand,  or it purposefully maximized for momentum. Either way it generated a  massive pop, and got very little flack for it.The share prices soared! That sounds great, except as Henry Blodget puts in a sharp Business Insider article,  “Pops provide no advantage to the company other than a bit of extremely  expensive and ephemeral excitement and PR.” I don’t fully agree,  though. Maybe PR isn’t as reliable as money in the bank, but I believe  public perception is actually quite important when you’re amidst a tech  talent crunch.Enterprise cloud software is critical and challenging to build. But  despite becoming more consumer rather than CTO-focused, I wouldn’t say  it’s sexy like a social network. Most people don’t grow up giddy to  build the cloud. If Workday wants the smartest minds to work for it  after it’s IPOed and the biggest rewards may have already been dealt  out, it needs to look like a clear winner.Meanwhile, having watched the vultures descend on Facebook, Workday  may have played it safe, pricing shares conservatively to ensure  positive momentum. It might not have needed those extra $450 million to  buy anyone who looks dangerous. Seventy-four percent may have been  overkill, but maybe prioritizing a rising price was the right move for  Workday.So if you consider IPOs from this perspective, it’s not necessarily  about raising the most money or getting the biggest first-day pop.Workday only “wins” if it doesn’t end up without enough money to buy  the scrappy new cloud kid on the block who might eat it’s lunch in three  years. And Facebook only “flopped” if all the money it raised can’t  convince people to board or stay on a sinking share price ship. Mo’  Money, Mo’ Problems, if you will.What really matters is a company getting what it needs, not just the purse or the share price."
922261,22762,2012-10-14T03:40:45-04:00,,"By Glenn SolomonThe successful public market debut of Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) this past week was breathtaking. The initial filing range of $21 - $24 was raised to $24 -$26 while the company was marketing on its roadshow. The IPO was ultimately priced at $28, and amazingly closed on its first day at $48.69, up 74 percent from the IPO price and up 116 percent from the mid-point of the initial filing range. As I've discussed earlier, hot IPOs don't always perform well in the months and quarters after pricing, but public investors believe in Workday enough to have priced it at over a $7 billion valuation.Although most entrepreneurs don't have the benefit of having started one of the most successful enterprise software companies earlier in life like Workday's co-founders, David Duffield and Aneel Bhusri, did at PeopleSoft, there are several relevant lessons from Workday's IPO for all aspiring entrepreneurs. Here are three:In their post-IPO interviews, Duffield and Bhusri said they believed the investment bankers did a great job pricing the offering, even though it popped in the aftermarket, because they stuck to the company's intrinsic value. Duffield and Bhusri didn't push the bankers to price the IPO up at the price the market was willing to pay. Instead they chose to set the deal at a price they feel they can justify based on the company's current prospects and metrics. Although by pricing this way they raised less money, they clearly like this trade-off. Regardless of what gyrations the stock price encounters over the coming months, Duffield and Bhusri believe they can continue to grow Workday from its IPO price, hence rewarding and attracting patient IPO investors.When fundraising, too often we see entrepreneurs opt to ""let the market decide"" the price. When demand is high, this approach can lead to bubble-like valuations. These super high prices limit dilution in the short term but can cause challenges over time, especially if a company is unable to sustain the froth. A few seasoned entrepreneurs have approached us recently with a clearly defined valuation maximum. This has forced GGV and other venture firms to differentiate on factors other than price and, by taking froth out of the equation, has ensured the entrepreneur feels comfortable he or she can drive to a higher price in ensuing rounds. Like Workday, these entrepreneurs want to see their investors profit from their investment, which, I'd argue, is a great starting point for a good relationship with your VCs.Unlike some of the fast-growth tech IPOs of the past few years that have had trouble in the aftermarket, such as Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), Workday makes a very strong case that its business model is getting better even while its growing over 100 percent annually. Each of R&D, Sales & Marketing and G&A as a percent of revenue are all steadily declining. So, while the company is investing rapidly for growth, investors are confident that predictable profitability is on its way. Despite the grow-at-all-costs venture environment prevailing today, entrepreneurs would do well to remember that, in the long run, public investors care about profits and reward business models that get more profitable with increased scale.Workday compellingly argues it can become a very large company over time given the enormity of its market potential. Although the company may be best known for its human resources management solution, Workday has been growing its suite over time, and its mix of early customers suggests the software will appeal to companies across many industries. As a result, public investors are paying less attention to Workday's size today and instead are more focused on the size Workday will achieve over time.Commonly, entrepreneurs fall into the trap of believing that achieving $100 million in revenue is the key to an IPO. Rather, as we see with Workday, reaching the $100 million milestone is far less important than having a sizable addressable market to grow into for many years after an IPO. Entrepreneurs who focus on building big businesses in large markets that can continue to grow rapidly well past the $100 million revenue threshold have a great chance to achieve public market success like Workday.Investors are certainly excited about Workday. Duffield and Bhusri have done an amazing job building Workday to where it is today, and investors are betting the best is yet to come for the company. Entrepreneurs should learn from Workday's success.Note: Glenn Solomon joined GGV Capital  as a Partner in the Menlo Park office in 2006.

921771,37001,2012-10-12T17:38:13-04:00,,"My esteemed colleague Ryan Leask and I have co-authored this three-part blog offering our insights on Workday's (NASDAQ:WDAY) IPO. This is part 3 in our blog on the subject. Part 1 looked at Workday vs. Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). Part 2 looked at Workday vs. SuccessFactors (NYSE:SAP), Taleo (NYSE:ORCL), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) and CRM.To try and summarize all of the analysis from the first and second blog posts:So the purpose of this blog is not to reiterate Workday's numbers, but is instead to offer our own conclusions from staring at this data for a while and working in this industry.Prior to going into the S-1 details, we thought Workday would be a slam dunk, and our only concern was the overall macro environment they are IPO'ing into. However, looking at their surprisingly high costs, we think it is going to take quite some time before Workday becomes profitable, and we think these costs indicate Workday might be betting the house on moving itself outside of the HCM domain. Workday did mention this as a risk in their S-1, in that they don't have proven success outside of the HCM domain yet, and only 10% of their customers (i.e. around 30 customers) have adopted their financial module. Looking at these numbers, we think this point may have been understated in the S-1.In this sense, Workday's IPO feels a lot more like a late-stage VC round than an IPO to us. It seems they are almost looking for money to try and find product-market fit for their new Finance product line. If they had chosen to sit back and ride their HCM business harder instead of investing into the finance area, the figures we're seeing would be a lot more attractive.But, it looks to us like they are really betting big to make longer term investments (which we are a big fan of). A prime example of this is their dual-class structure of its common share. We love this tactical move which allows Workday to build a great company and not get dragged into a bitter take-over fight (cough, Oracle-PeopleSoft, cough).Going into its IPO, Salesforce had multiples of 11.6 and 6.3 on TTM and FTM revenues respectively. It went on to return more than 900% over the next 8 years! Workday has TTM and FTM multiples of 31 and 14 going into IPO, so it is hard to believe that it will yield a return similar to Salesforce, and we're anticipating returns more like those SuccessFactors and Taleo produced (at least over the next several years). In hindsight, Salesforce's IPO was a steal.What this IPO comes down to for us, is that you have to decide for yourself whether Workday is going to nail the Finance market like they did HCM… or not. If yes, it's a great buy. If not, they are going to continue plowing through the cash the HCM business generates for a lot longer. It certainly feels like Workday is carrying more risk than we would have first thought, but it is a great company with great historical growth and even better prospects for the future growth. Perhaps the timing of this IPO is more a reflection of the uncertainty at the macro level, as this might possibly be their last chance for a while if the fiscal cliff kicks in.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in CRM, NOW over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.Disclaimer: All numbers are approximate. We are not offering any  investment advice, and all the analysis we have performed to support our  blogs is preliminary."
1660612,48501,2013-08-27T18:12:30-04:00,,"On June 4, 2013, I published an article titled ""Workday: Set To Out Grow The Industry."" In that article, I suggested that it would be a good time to look for entry spots to get long shares of Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY). Since that time, shares of Workday have increased from about the $60-$65 range to about $76. That implies a return of anywhere from 17% to 27%, which is pretty good. That said, it is time to analyze what has happened since I that time and determine if investors should continue to remain long shares of Workday.Well, second-quarter results were just released. I think the second quarter was good: Revenue came in above expectations, but the operating cash flow was a little bit weak. With that factored in and the valuations updated, I think investors should be neutral on shares of Workday. I can't justify being long the stock anymore at 28 times sales and 16 times book value.Recent DevelopmentsBusiness ProfileWorkday provides enterprise cloud applications for human capital management, payroll, financial management, grants management, time tracking, procurement, employee expense management and analytics. The company offers innovative and adaptable technology focused on the consumer Internet experience and cloud delivery model. The applications are designed for global enterprises to manage complex and dynamic operating environments. Workday provides customers with highly adaptable, accessible and reliable applications to manage critical business functions that enable them to optimize their financial and human capital resources.The company has one operating segment, cloud applications. Revenues are generated from subscription services and professional services. Just over 80% of consolidated revenue came from the U.S. Just under 40% of consolidated revenue was invested in research and development.Workday has incurred significant losses since its inception in 2005. Management does not expect the company to become profitable in the foreseeable future. That said, if management decreases R&D spending, and selling and marketing expenditure each by 20% of revenue, the company would be profitable. Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) compete with Workday. Furthermore, Workday also competes with The Ultimate Software Group, Inc., Automatic Data Processing, Lawson, Inc., Ceridian, Concur Technologies, Inc., and NetSuite, Inc. (NYSE:N).Workday could have a higher sales growth rate than competitors. Additionally, I'm bullish on the industry. I think its human capital management and FM offerings are competitive in the market. Plus, some large enterprises are diversifying by purchasing application offerings from companies other than Oracle and SAP.Financial Performance ForecastThe previous revenue forecast that I was using for Workday estimated 2013 revenue at $439 million. Because second-quarter revenue came in at $107.6 million, I am increasing my revenue forecast to $450 million in 2013. The net loss as a percentage of revenue should be in the 33% to 38% range with the operating loss as a percentage of revenue in the 30% to 35% range.Cash provided by operating activities is a yellow flag; there was a $10 million decline compared to the prior year's six-month period. The decline in cash provided by unearned revenue is a contributing factor. From the end of the fiscal fourth quarter to the end of the fiscal second quarter, current deferred revenue increased from $199.3 million to $247.3 million, which is positive for the valuations.Revenue accelerated compared to the first-quarter year-over-year comparison, which is bullish for the valuations. Overall, this year is going pretty well thus far. Next, I'll examine the valuations. Including the new data, Workday is trading at 28 times sales and 15.8 times book. The last time I wrote about Workday it was trading at 17.4 times sales. The valuations are extended. I'm bullish on the stock, in general, but neutral at this valuation. In other words, I don't think it is a good short idea, and it is too expensive to be a good long idea.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

921931,25120,2012-10-13T06:22:20-04:00,,"Workday (WDAY) made its public debut on Friday. Shares of the leading provider of enterprise cloud-based applications for human resource services ended their first day up 73.9% at $48.69 per share.The public offeringWorkday offers human capital management solutions, payroll, financial management, time tracking, procurement and employee expense management services.The company has achieved significant growth and a global scale in a short period of time. Workday was founded in 2005 by David Duffield and Aneel Bhusri. The latter ran PeopleSoft before Oracle (ORCL) bought the company. Since inception, the company has created a global customer base serving more than 325 companies. Its customer base includes large global companies such as Four Seasons, Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB), AIG (NYSE:AIG) and Lenovo. Workday currently employs some 1,450 employees.The company sold 22.8 million shares for $28 a piece. Workday raised $637 million in gross proceeds in the offering process. Based on the offer price of $28.00, the company is valued at $4.5 billion.The offering is a great success. The offer price was set above the expected $24-$26 price range set by the company and its bankers. All of the shares offered in the offering were sold by the company. In total, 14% of the company's shares outstanding were offered. At Friday's closing price of $48.69 per share, the company is valued at $7.8 billion.Major banks which brought the company public were Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Canaccord Genuity and Wells Fargo, among others.ValuationWorkday operates in the fast growing market of enterprise cloud-based software applications. Workday helps companies to better manage their financial and human resources. Its main competitors are other large ERP-based firms, including Oracle and SAP (SAP).For the annual year of 2011, Workday generated revenues of $134.4 million compared to just $7.3 million in 2010. The company reported net losses of $79.6 million, compared to a loss of $5.5 million the year before.For the first six months of 2012, the company generated revenues of $119.5 million, up 118% on the year. Net losses came in at $46.9 million, up from $36.3 million the year before.Workday intends to use the proceeds of the offering to increase the company's financial flexibility. Net proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.Excluding the offering proceeds, the company operates with roughly $123 million in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company operates without any debt. Based on the severe losses, the $637 million in gross proceeds will boost Workday's net cash position to over $600 million.As such, the valuation of Workday's operating assets come in at $7.2 billion. Based on a rough annual revenue estimate of $275 million for 2012, the market values the operating assets at 26 times annual revenues. The company is likely to report big losses for the full year. More relevant for investors might be future revenues. Workday estimates to have bookings of around $500 million for 2012, bringing the future revenue multiple down to 14 times annual revenues.Investment ThesisThe offering of Workday is an incredible success. Initially, the company was supposed to go public for a price between $21 and $24 per share. Later this price range got revised upwards to $24-$26 per share, and eventually shares were sold for $28 per share. Shares opened with large gains on Friday and hit an intra-day high of $51.37 per share, closing at $48.69 per share.As such, shares are trading some 116% above the midpoint of the first guided price range. Given the operational losses, the company does not expect to pay a dividend anytime soon.The sentiment around the offering has been very strong, with many market commentators calling it a next bubble. Valued at 26 times annual revenues, Workday's valuation is absurd, despite the fact revenue growth exceeds 100% per year. Even if the company manages to double the annual revenues for this year, 2013 and 2014, the company is still valued at 5-6 times annual revenues.While Workday is able to report significant revenue growth and operates in a long-term growth market, the valuation has become to excessive. Shareholders should be warned by Workday's own comments that the company is expected to lose money for a considerable period of time.After shares more than doubled from the midpoint of the initially guided price range, shares have simply become too expensive. The business and industry prospects are very good, yet I remain very cautious on the back of a valuation which is sky-high. Serious value investors stay on the sidelines.While I think the valuation is excessive, I am hesitant to initiate an outright short position given further potential of ""bubble-valuations."" The bulls are in firm control and most likely will point out the positive divergence between ""revenue booking"" and ""reported revenues."" As always, gravity will take over at some point and the shorts will be the winners.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

898431,24276,2012-10-01T17:53:07-04:00,,"Workday has filed its S-1 in anticipation of an IPO under the symbol WDAY.Is this the second coming of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)? It sort of depends on whether you think you can trust its founders.Co-CEOs Aneel Bhusri and Dave Duffield, who ran Peoplesoft before Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) bought it in a 2005 hostile takeover, control about two-thirds of the common stock in the new company. Venture capitalists Greylock and New Enterprise Associates also hold over 10% each. But the IPO itself will sell under one-seventh of the company, for $512 million, valuing the whole at $3.6 billion.So whether this turns into Facebook depends in part on whether the founders and VCs stick around, or dump shares as soon as they can. It's sort of all about the float.Another big number to keep in mind - $247 million. That's the amount of money the company expects to book in revenues over the next year, based on present subscriptions. Workday sells the same kind of HR and finance software Peoplesoft sold back in the day - they just sell it as a service, meaning (supposedly) that they sell it ""in the cloud.""Many folks call Workday ""Peoplesoft in the cloud"" but it's more like Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM), in that it's a vertically-integrated cloud stack, including applications, to which customers can write add-in modules. (The difference is that Workday's applications are focused on internal functions while Salesforce is focused on marketing, on customer management.)Speaking of which, Workday and Salesforce.com are partners (sort of) - Salesforce bought an outfit called Rypple, renamed it Work.Com, but insisted at its latest Dreamforce event that's just a tiny niche within the HR space, and that its links with Workday remain secure.If you want another negative take, Oracle is going after both Salesforce and Workday with its new 12c database software, which should be cloudier. They're spreading as much FUD over the combination as they can. One more negative take - SAP (NYSE:SAP) bought SuccessFactors specifically to get into this market.So, is this the second coming of Facebook? It depends on what you think the value of $247 million, and climbing, sales may be. We're looking at a full valuation of 12x sales, but that figure has been doubling (or better) every year since its founding, and while that growth has slowed as the numbers have gotten bigger and the company has yet to make money, here are the key numbers for bulls. The total cost of its $119 million in revenue booked for the first half of 2012 came to $53 million. From the first half of 2011 to the first half of 2012, revenues grew at 118%, while costs grew 95%.So, no, this is not the next Facebook. But it could be the next Peoplesoft, which brought $10 billion from Oracle seven years ago.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

So far, this IPO has catapulted up 86% from its $28 offering price just this last Friday.At that P/S ratio, the other names in the group look downright cheap. Cornerstone OnDemand (NASDAQ:CSOD), NetSuite (NYSE:N), Saba Software (OTCPK:SABA), and Ultimate Software (NASDAQ:ULTI) all have lower P/S valuations.Still, Workday has been growing its revenues faster than its peers. Workday's revenues grew at a 118% clip for the first 6 months of this year, far greater than the other SaaS stocks mentioned. No wonder investors went gaga over the stock. Workday is piling up revenues at a blistering pace but does it deserve the sky-high P/S valuation?I hate to be a party pooper. Per the prospectus, sales growth is actually decelerating. Workday revenue growth has been dropping from 294% in 2009 and 170% in 2010. Sorry, guys, but wild valuations call for wild sales acceleration and Workday's best days might be behind it. Following the trend, it wouldn't be surprising to see Workday's revenue growth slow next year to a 60 to 70% rate. Not bad, but not worth the staggering valuation.With decelerating growth, Workday investors should swap into the more attractively priced Cornerstone. You get revenue growth at easier to swallow valuations.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company had previously set a range of $21-$24 in its original prospectus, before once again raising the pricing amount to $24-$26 due to a high level of interest. With shares already above the revised range, will the IPO be a boom or a bust when shares hit the open market on the New York Stock Exchange?Workday is an enterprise cloud based application company. The firm offers human capital management for companies through its offerings of payroll, financial management, time tracking, procurement, and employee expense tracking.Workday offers its subscription based services to 340 customers. With a large customer base, no single customer makes up 5% or more of Workday's revenue, helping to keep the revenue stream diversified. Subscriptions are signed for three to five years, with fees based on the size of the company. Workday had a backlog of $325 million as of July 31st, compared to $240 million on January 31st. The company lists some pretty impressive companies as customers including:· Aviva International Holdings, AIG, Flextronics, Four Seasons, Kimberly-Clark, Lenovo, VMWare, Cardinal Health, Chiquita, Tyco, ValsparServices are offered to companies in categories ranging from technology, financial services, business services, health care, manufacturing, consumer, and retail. Along with companies, Workday is expanding its offerings to manage solutions for education and government employers. Workday now counts the following schools as customers:· Academy of Art University· Brown University· Cornell University· Georgetown University· New York University· State of Nebraska· University of Southern CaliforniaHere is the industry background of Workday's sector:· The market for enterprise resource management software is large and highly strategic· Changes in the business environment, user expectations and technology are driving a disruptive re-platforming of the enterprise application market· Legacy enterprise applications provide limited business context, and can be inflexible and expensive to implement and maintainThe company releases three updates to its software every year. With a cloud based platform, customers get the updates for free, and don't have to worry about expensive expansion software. The current edition of Workday 17 features over 100 new and improved items. Here is a look at the software that Workday has created to further its revenue stream:· 2006: Human capital management application· 2007: Financial management application· 2008: Procurement and Employee expense management application· 2009: Workday payroll, mobile application· 2010: Talented management application· 2011: iPad application, Workday integration platformWorkday's growth strategy going forward consists of:· Expand our customer base· Maintain our innovation leadership by strengthening and extending our suite of applications· Expand internationally· Deepen our relationship with existing customer base· Further develop our partner ecosystem· Leverage our unique cultureWorkday has a strategic partnership with Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM). The company competes against SAP, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), and Automated Data Processing (NASDAQ:ADP). Workday's founder David Duffield, was the former founder of Peoplesoft, which was acquired by Oracle in 2005.Looking at the financials of Workday, the company has increased its revenue significantly but still trades with a net loss. Here is the revenue from the last three years, along with the net losses:· Fiscal 2010: $25.2 million revenue, $-49.9 million net loss· Fiscal 2011: $68.1 million revenue, $-56.2 million net loss· Fiscal 2012: $134.4 million revenue, $-79.6 million net lossIn the most recent six months (ending July 31), Workday posted revenue of $119.52 million, which was more than double the prior year's $54.82. Here is a look at Workday's revenue on a quarterly basis that is growing (in $millions):After the initial price offering, co-founders and affiliates will own 67% of the voting power thanks to a dual class level of stock. There will be a total of 160.29 million shares outstanding including Class A and Class B shares. The company plans on using proceeds from the IPO for working capital and general corporate purposes. Workday has said that the funds may be used for strategic acquisitions.Workday shares have already gained on two occasions prior to their IPO due to high demand. The IPO is the highest technology offering since Facebook  (NASDAQ:FB) hit the open market. Demand will continue to be high when shares trade Friday or Monday. I would let the dust settle before jumping into this company. If you can get shares under $30, I would do so for the long run. With only 340 customers, Workday has plenty of room to grow. The company has minimal exposure to international markets, setting up future expansion down the road. The company has come up with a new application or offering every year to try and upsell to existing customers.

899741,36451,2012-10-02T10:48:24-04:00,,"On August 30th 2012, cloud-based HR and Finance enterprise software provider Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) issued its S-1. The company has now announced that shares will begin trading on October 12th and will be priced between $21 and $24. While we wait for the exact valuation to be determined, it is helpful to examine Workday's performance relative to two other cloud based SaaS companies, Salesforce.com (NYSE:CRM) and NetSuite (NYSE:N).Why compare Workday to Salesforce.com and NetSuite?While neither Salesforce.com nor NetSuite are direct competitors to Workday, it is reasonable to compare the companies due to similarities in technology and business model. All provide a cloud-based SaaS solution and all were founded within the last fifteen years. In comparison, established players like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and SAP (NYSE:SAP), which will serve as primary competitors to Workday, provide on-premise solutions and were established in the 70s. Both Oracle and SAP are developing their own cloud based services, but cloud is still a very small part of their businesses.While Salesforce.com could become a competitor to Workday in the future, today it is a Workday customer and strategic partner. Salesforce.com is a provider of CRM applications, which are not part of Workday's product suite. On the other hand, NetSuite does overlap with Workday in terms of product offerings but serves middle market companies, while Workday focuses on global enterprises.The following table provides a comparison of the three organizations:This article will analyze the growth of Workday, Salesforce.com, and NetSuite since 2008, 2001, 2003, respectively. At that time, revenues for these three companies were at $6.4M, $5.4M, and $8.3M, respectively. The data and company information that follows has all been collected from the Workday S-1 as well as the Salesforce.com annual reports and NetSuite annual reports.Comparing the speed of growthWorkday's growth has been comparable to that of Salesforce.com. If you believe that Workday will follow the same path as Salesforce.com, its business is just about to explode and its revenue curve is about to get much steeper. In fact, Workday has signed several very impressive clients, including giants like AIG. At the same time, Workday has been rapidly improving and expanding its suite. The company states that only 10% of clients are currently using the financial management product, creating a major cross selling opportunity.But the cost side looks more worrisomeWhile neither Salesforce.com nor NetSuite were profitable just a couple of years into their operations, both were showing a positive trajectory. Workday's losses, on the other hand, are getting bigger and bigger. The S-1 filing states, ""We have a history of cumulative losses and we do not expect to be profitable for the foreseeable future.""Workday's costs of revenue are driving lossesCompared to Salesforce.com and NetSuite, Workday's cost of revenue is incredibly high.Workday segments its revenues into subscription services and professional services. Costs for the subscription services include employee related expenses as well as hosting, data center, computer equipment, and software. Costs for the professional services segment include employee related expenses, subcontractors, and travel.The professional services business has a significantly smaller gross margin compared to subscription services. Workday states in its filing, ""We are intensely focused on our customers' success and have invested in our professional services ecosystem in order to promote seamless deployments and robust customer adoption."" Essentially, Workday is subsidizing professional services to ensure that customers experience a smooth transition to Workday. The open question is, how long will it take Workday to build up its partner ecosystem with integrators like Accenture and Deloitte so that these costs can start to come down?Why are Workday's R&D costs high?Though Workday's R&D costs have been coming down as a percent of revenue, they are still exceptionally high. Workday boasts the following innovations over competitors:However, it is not clear why R&D costs for Workday have been significantly higher than those of Salesforce.com and NetSuite.Workday has maintained discipline with selling as well as administrative expensesAs can be seen from the following charts, Workday has kept both sales & marketing as well as general & administrative expenses below competitor levels. In particular, the low sales & marketing expenses are impressive, since the company has grown rapidly and has amassed a portfolio of clients spanning multiple industries, education, and government.This is reflective of the deep relationships that the company's leadership has brought to the table. In particular, prior to co-founding Workday, David Duffield founded PeopleSoft, which was later taken over by Oracle and is currently one of Workday's primary competitors. Furthermore, Workday's co-founder Aneel Bhusri, COO Michael Stankey, general counsel James Shaughnessy, VP of Development Petros Dermetzis, and CTO Stan Swete all come from the ranks of senior management at PeopleSoft.General and administrative costs include costs related to back office operations. Although Workday has grown its staff to over 1,450 employees, back office spend looks low relative to Salesforce.com and NetSuite.A look at Workday, Salesforce.com, and NetSuite cost structuresThe following charts show the cost structures of Workday, Salesforce.com, and NetSuite. Cost of revenues, R&D, and Sales & Marketing each contribute about a third to Workday's total costs.In contrast, Salesforce.com's cost structure is heavily skewed towards sales & marketing expenditures, with very little spend on R&D.NetSuite is also highly skewed towards sales & marketing, with a bit more emphasis on R&D relative to Salesforce.com.ConclusionThus far Workday's growth has been impressive, but it has come at a high cost. Expenses associated with creating a partner ecosystem and bringing new clients on board have led to low margins in the professional services business segment. R&D costs have also been extremely high relative to other cloud-based peers. Salesforce.com, for example, was able to develop a popular software with much lower R&D spend. To reach the success of Salesforce.com, Workday will need to bring its costs in line, while continuing to drive revenue at an increasingly rapid pace.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

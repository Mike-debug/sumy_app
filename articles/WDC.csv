Western Digital stock would have returned nearly 20%, if only it held its June peak of around $50. In its fiscal fourth quarter (Q4/FY2020), WDC posted non-GAAP earnings of $1.23, beating consensus by a penny. Its GAAP EPS beat estimates by 6 cents. If NAND and enterprise hard disk demand is strong and profit margins are comparable, why did the company lower its outlook?The strong cloud business benefited from the work-from-home trend, as investors expected. Flash-based (“NAND”) notebook sales post WDC’s OEM end-market sent revenue to record levels. Although Covid-19 disrupted its distribution channels slightly, the company is still overly cautious.Management’s expectations for uncertainties ahead are justified. In the U.S., the coronavirus proved that it could resurge if people let down their guard. As fall approaches, the virus likes to spread in indoor areas (due to higher viral concentrations in the air or on surfaces). Still, WDC did not clearly explain why it issued a weaker outlook.On its conference call, Western Digital said it is navigating multiple substantial product transitions. It hinted that product launch execution may face risks, such as delays. The stock has a good value grade. Markets applied a high discount at a 12 times price-to-earnings ratio:Data courtesy of SA PremiumData center revenue will only increase as cloud storage soars. Revenue grew 32% Y/Y to $1.68 billion:Source: WDC Earnings Call PresentationRevenue from Client Devices grew 19% to $1.92 billion. Only the Client Solutions unit fell 9% Y/Y, albeit contributing to only $0.69 billion in revenue.Although I watched for an entry point in WDC stock for months, the ~$50 was an exit price. The company’s Flash gross margin was 30.5%, up on favorable pricing and falling costs. Hard drive gross margin was 27.2%, down sequentially. To compete more effectively against Seagate, Western Digital is still struggling to lift margins. Covid-19 hurt HDD costs by 4.7% and management are suggesting it still faces unknown costs ahead.Flash and HDD gross margin and revenue are a tale of two worlds:Source: WDC Earnings Call PresentationWDC forecast non-GAAP gross margin of between 25% and 27%. It added $80 million in costs related to the K1 fab. So, investors should expect continued pressure on margin for the next few quarters.WDC has an 18-terabyte storage drive ramp-up ahead. It will produce over 1 million units in the current quarter. But in flash, CFO Bob Eulau said it has some price and mix headwinds. Eulau also mentioned it does not face the same volume challenges in April. Yet he was not clear on the call on how much costs fell. Western Digital already suspended its dividend worth $150 million. So, investors are not getting income for holding the stock as they wait for prospects to improve.In the quarter, WDC paid its standard $63 million in debt repayment. It has a $3 billion cash position but a gross debt outstanding of $9.7 billion. The Debt-to-EBITDA stands at 4.2 times.The current quarterly EPS guidance of up to 65 cents would give an annualized forward P/E of 14.3 times ($37.36 closing price / $2.60 EPS).Expert investors may build a 5-year discounted cash flow revenue exit model.Model courtesy of finboxBy assuming revenue growing no more than 1% annually, WDC shares still have an upside of 20%.Related Investment: Micron Technology (MU)Savvy technology investors may consider holding Micron shares instead. The company has a better history of beating consensus estimates by a long shot. Micron beat expectations in four out of the six quarters:Data courtesy of Stock RoverMicron also has 3D flash storage and tailwinds from strong pricing and a falling supply of NAND. Conversely, Western Digital disappointed investors half the time:Data courtesy of Stock RoverWestern Digital is a value idea that only suits the most patient investor. Micron offers better growth prospects but is sensitive to memory prices. With storage demand from clients growing, investors could bet that new products will raise WDC’s NAND margins and pricing. If it pulls that off earlier than expected, the stock could double from its yearly lows to trade at above $50."
4342186,22786,2020-05-01T17:32:10-04:00,Western Digital stock fell after the company cut dividends.Management gains from financial flexibility.Stock undervalued again.,"When Western Digital (WDC) announced a dividend cancellation alongside its third-quarter 2020 earnings report, shares fell by 10%. Revenue rose by a healthy 14%, driven by strong demand for high-speed solid-state storage. Management saw evidence of the stay-at-home order from COVID-19 hurting traditional hard drive demand. WDC shareholders have no choice but to accept that the stock is no longer an income play. Is this sacrifice worth it for the debt reduction, de-leveraging, and investing back into the business?Western Digital earned 85 cents a share (non-GAAP). Net revenue rose 14% Y/Y to $4.2 billion but fell 1% sequentially. Despite home PC demand for mechanical drives falling, WDC is driving 16- and 18-terabyte storage.Source: Western DigitalThe company has little room for profit growth, due to stagnant revenue in three of the last five quarters. The coronavirus pandemic shifted storage demand away from end-user computers and towards the cloud. So, Western Digital must rely on a continued shift toward client SSD devices to offset the weaker parts of its business.Higher flash pricing, strong SSD sales, and a growing need for notebook solutions will offset the near-term weaknesses. As the work-from-home movement becomes permanent or more frequent, gross margins from the flash business will increase.Gross margins already increased sequentially last quarter:WDC needs average selling prices to increase to more than offset the gross margin decline from the hard drive business:Although the 14-TB and 18TB sales may pick up steam, the need for high-performance SSDs will matter more for its business. For example, on its conference call CFO Robert Eulau said ""We're still very bullish on the enterprise SSD market….We've got goals to get up to 20% market share there.""Higher NAND prices, or material costs, may weigh on results in the current (fiscal fourth) quarter. If WDC passes the higher costs to customers without hurting demand, the company's profits should not fall. Investors cannot predict how costs play out. NAND and hard drive prices change monthly.Just as other companies in various sectors plan one quarter at a time, WDC is doing the same. If the outlook for the second half of the year improves, the company will adjust its investments accordingly. Eliminating the dividend alienates income investors while giving the company more flexibility. Fortunately, the company's near-term prospects are improving as talk of a re-opening of the economy gathers steam. The stronger cash flow from the dividend cut, balanced with a healthy factory utilization, and stable supply chain positions the business for a rebound.By anticipating a potential downturn in the business cycle, WDC is working to cut its $6 billion gross debt ($3 billion in net debt). As evidence of a rebound in demand builds, the storage company may adjust accordingly. This includes ramping up storage for the smartphone market should sales increase later this year.Investors should model a seasonally weak period ahead, lasting one or two quarters. As smartphone sales improve, lifted by a re-opening in stores in the U.S. and China currently, WDC's revenue will bounce back. Lower profits sent the value and growth scores for WDC stock lower.Data courtesy of Stock RoverThe overall rebound in the stock set sentiment to a positive score of 82/100. But after the 12% drop following the earnings report, WDC stock will fall back to deep value territory. The debt-to-equity ratio is not a concern since interest rates are zero. The company could re-finance debt at favorable rates. It has enough cash flow to re-invest strategically in research and development. For now, the company may turn its focus on launching high-capacity storage drives, SSD, and notebook solutions.The one-day drop in Western Digital stock created another buying opportunity for value investors. It may drift lower alongside a stock sell-off. But the deep discount decreases the risk of owning the stock for the rest of the year.Management is paying down debt as investors are forfeiting the regular dividend income. The long-term trade-off is worthwhile for shareholders. The sacrifice of a 12% drop in the stock following the quarterly report might follow with the share price recovering. By 2021, if the economy recovers, so too will WDC stock."
4369385,76115,2020-08-18T10:00:00-04:00,"Western Digital did not do well during the pandemic or in the near-term recovery as apparent from its recent earnings and guidance.Micron's shares were guilty by association, but one must look at the critical differences between the two companies, beyond the obvious.Western Digital's issues are not Micron's issues and that's worrisome for a long investment in WDC.","It's hard to find a tech product where memory is not being added and expanded, this year especially - servers, smartphones, gaming consoles, GPUs, etc. More specifically, on the non-volatile side, which spans SSDs (solid-state drives) and HDDs (hard disk drives), there is a tremendous shift to more performance-driven SSDs and capacity expansion therein.(Source: Wikimedia Commons and author)Micron (MU), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), and SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) all had good things to say about the back-half of the year after an excellent first half. Micron sang datacenter, mobile, and console praises for a healthy second half and guided above consensus on its FQ3 earnings call. All of those verticals involve non-volatile memory and a lot of it. If you need a refresher:However, Western Digital (WDC) didn't sing the same tune, or perhaps even the same genre of song. To start, it appears the company is more affected by the retail side of the pandemic than its competitors. Secondly, it's also not in the mobile business in any meaningful way.Starting with mobile, the company doesn't have a presence worth mentioning, at least one it could capitalize on.What Eulau is saying is even though it isn't in the mobile business, when things are tough on the mobile side, its competitors need to shift those bits to other verticals, which adversely affect the company. Why? Because those extra bits getting offloaded from weaker mobile sales get brought to the markets Western Digital is in and causes a supply/demand imbalance. It means the company fronts all of the downside and none of the upside. Micron, for example, is looking at a resumption of mobile demand as it heads into the next quarter. Western Digital's guide doesn't include a boost from mobile.Before getting deeper into the company's guidance, which is what sank the stock, allow me to finish with the retail problem; it was a big enough issue to make the prepared remarks:This led to Client Solutions revenue of $687M, which was down 16% sequentially and down 9% year-over-year. This was a major driver of the weak quarter, which missed by over $57M on the top line. In other words, the company has a retail dependence, which puts it closer to a retailer than some would think. While others have capitalized on the markets which got a boost from COVID-19, WDC feels more headwind than tailwind due to their relatively more significant retail dependence.This brings us to the guide, which was not encouraging. This is what sank not only Western Digital but Micron as well. The guide came in at $3.8B at the mid-point versus consensus of $4.36B. However, the market moved too quickly and tied the two companies together.This piece from the earnings call sums it up pretty well - reliance on retail:Then on the other side, we have to remember Western Digital is not just a NAND company; it's also an HDD company.(Source: Western Digital's FQ4 Earnings Slide Deck)It's competing against itself in terms of outrunning the HDD decline. As hard drives become less enticing due to the cost-effectiveness of SDD in terms of performance, it will become a steadier headwind - a headwind that is already pretty stiff.Getting to the crux of the matter, four things separate Western Digital from Micron. The first is that Micron does not deal with HDDs. Unlike Western Digital, this headwind is not one Micron sees. Micron would love nothing more than to displace HDDs.The second is the retail impact Western Digital feels is far less insulated than the one Micron feels. Micron not only is pushing toward high-value solutions but also is focused on higher-value industries, products in high-performance industries such as data center, graphics, mobile, and automotive.Lastly, while Western Digital saw strong growth in the data center, it doesn't get the lift of mobile. It only feels the depression of mobile. Micron can realize the capacity increases and unit volume boost of mobile handsets in the second half, whereas Western Digital will sit it out.Furthermore, this past quarter would have been one where mobile would have turned the quarter around for WDC. Micron saw the most growth in mobile this recent quarter out of any other segment with 21% quarter-over-quarter growth and 30% year-over-year growth.Finally, Micron is getting better pricing for its NAND than Western Digital. Micron's ASPs for NAND were up mid-single-digits percentage for March-May while Western Digital's were up 1% for April-June.If you're thinking about going long Western Digital, you have to consider these shortcomings.Will WDC benefit from the overall NAND trend of the future? Yes, it will. Can it do it quickly enough to offset the dying HDD market? It remains to be seen. At $35 per share, it becomes enticing.But, without a dividend or an idea of when the dividend will be ""unsuspended,"" it makes a tough case to go long. Management has put shareholder returns at the bottom of its priority list. Micron, on the other hand, has finished its debt reduction priority, and so it can focus on reinvestment and shareholder return programs.(Source: Western Digital's FQ4 Earnings Slide Deck)I still own WDC at an average price of ~$40, but I am wondering if I should lighten up on it and find better opportunities. The market hasn't been shy in saying semiconductors such as Micron, Western Digital, and Seagate (STX) are out of favor. It's difficult, and some would say unwise, to go against the tide. For an investment in WDC to work out, you have to not see it as a value trap, for one, but also be ready for a year of this working itself out. A year from now, the priorities may allow the dividend to be reinstituted, but it depends on how well the product portfolio pans out for the company and how quickly debt reduction goes.Data by YChartsCurrently, the company's debt-to-EBITDA is at 5.3x (annually) whereas the top side of its targeted range is 3.5x. With EBITDA set to decline 40% based on my calculations for FQ1, this is going to take at least a year to get to just the top end of the debt-to-EBITDA range. This includes using all the company's free cash flow going toward debt repayment over the next year. I also take into account the company performing sequentially better after FQ1 for the rest of the fiscal year.Now, these structural differences do not mean Micron doesn't have its own headwinds to deal with; it merely means the extrapolation of Western Digital's performance is not a correlation to Micron's future performance. You must break down the differences between the two companies - and there are quite a few - all of them crucial to the investment thesis for Western Digital.Micron is signaling some new worries, which I'll expand on in another article, but to use Western Digital as a barometer for Micron is not a valid method of analysis. Western Digital is dealing with its own struggles. I'd consider adding to Western Digital if retail continues to pick up. Put more plainly, consider WDC a post-COVID-19 investment. Right now, it's in the dumps, and it's due to the management of its portfolio and what verticals it's heavy in (or not heavy in) during these trying times.Of course, we can look at this a little differently and say this may be the time to pick up shares (buy low, sell high), but I see WDC as dead money for longer. I can at least tell you Micron understands the idea of focusing on the high-valued verticals. I can't say the same for Western Digital."
4369729,77985,2020-08-19T13:28:20-04:00,"WDC reported sizable gains in revenue and net income, but earnings call revelations caused the stock to drop nonetheless.WDC sees weakness ahead in cloud data center demand, a bright spot in prior quarters.WDC anticipates another downturn in the storage industry and getting out of it may not be so straightforward this time due to several factors.WDC and the NAND industry may have to deal with a price war to reduce the number of competitors.","Western Digital's (WDC) latest quarterly report contained a lot of positives. For instance, revenue and net income improved considerably, both QoQ and YoY. Yet the stock sold off in the aftermath of the earnings release after management alluded to the possible return of something the company has struggled with many times before. What that is will be covered next.Q4 revenue grew by 18% YoY to $4,287M. Non-GAAP net income and EPS jumped by 638% and 624% to $369M and $1.23 respectively. While revenue growth was robust, it was also uneven. Revenue growth was led by the Data Center Devices and Solutions segment, which grew 32% YoY. In contrast, the Client Solutions segment declined by 9% YoY. Growth was mostly driven by cloud demand and notebook SSDs.Source: Form 8-KThe Q4 release means that the final numbers for FY2020 are available. FY2020 revenue grew by 1% to $16.7B. But non-GAAP net income fell by 36% to $914M. Results were dragged down in the early part of the fiscal year.The forecast sees Q1 FY2021 revenue at $3.7-3.9B, a decrease of 6% at the midpoint. Gross margin and EPS are expected to come in at 25-27% and $0.45-0.65 respectively.WDC continues to recover from the lingering effects of a prior downcycle in the data storage industry with demand and prices going down. Quarterly revenue shrank for five consecutive quarters, from Q3 2018 to Q3 2019. The results for the last two quarters of FY2020 are much better than the two before.Furthermore, WDC reported progress in several areas, such as enterprise SSDs, gaming and energy-assisted HDDs. But despite the gains, WDC has dropped by about 20% in response and is down almost 44% YTD. The reason why can be found in the earnings call.Unlike the upbeat headline numbers, the Q4 earnings call portrayed a different picture in terms of outlook. For instance, data center demand has been very strong and suppliers like WDC have been able to boost exabyte shipments. But while WDC remains optimistic about the cloud's long-term prospects, it expects demand to weaken short term due to the need to digest what has already been shipped. From the Q4 earnings call:A transcript of the Q4 FY2020 earnings call can be found here.WDC points out that the amount of exabytes shipped has been running above the long-term goal of 35% CAGR. It will take some time to absorb excess inventories.WDC sees headwinds ahead for the data storage industry. Both HDD and NAND flash memory will be affected.On a more positive note, WDC believes that current market conditions are not as bad as a couple of years ago. Suppliers are trying to maintain a balance between supply and demand.While COVID-19 has and continues to cause problems, the long-term effect of the pandemic is seen as positive for WDC.Basically, WDC remains optimistic about the industry's long-term prospects. If there are hiccups, they will be temporary. But it cannot know for sure how long they will last.WDC is not alone in seeing headwinds ahead. There are others that feel the same way. For instance, Trendforce predicts that NAND prices will weaken due to oversupply. The irony here is that a positive price environment is what led to the latest upturn in the storage industry and NAND in particular.But the same positive price environment is sowing the seeds for the next downturn. When prices are weak, manufacturers pull back on supply growth to support prices. But as prices recover, manufacturers no longer have an incentive to restrain output and prices begin to weaken. This issue was covered in greater detail in a previous article.If there's another downturn, the industry may not be able to get out of it the way it used to in the past. That's because there's a new player on the scene. China's YMTC recently announced that it has kicked off construction of its next phase, which will see its Wuhan fab capacity expand from 100,000 to 300,000 12-inch wafers per month. When completed, it will equal about one-fifth of global NAND output at the end of 2019.Process technology is being upgraded along with capacity. YMTC currently produces 64-layers TLC 3D-NAND memory chips. But its roadmap calls for mass production of 128-layers NAND later this year and 192-layers in the second half of 2021. Going from 64L to 128L could double bit supply, even before any additional wafer starts.All these improvements in technology and capacity will have consequences for WDC. It forces competitors to upgrade their process technology at a faster pace to keep up, something that they may be reluctant to do as it increases bit supply growth more than they would like to. It used to be that industry players like Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF), Kioxia, Micron (MU) and Intel (INTC) could limit output growth to prop up prices.But the addition of YMTC makes that tactic less viable. Unlike others, YMTC may not be so inclined to slow down expansion for a number of reasons. If YMTC keeps on expanding as it plans to, the NAND market may remain depressed for a lot longer than in the past. A previous article elaborates on this issue and why another downturn is likely.Source: Wikimedia CommonsThe data storage industry tends to go through cycles and the last few quarters have been good. NAND prices in particular have improved. Many industry players like WDC and Samsung have reported improved earnings as a result. Based on this, one could say that the industry has recovered from the downturn of 2018 and 2019. But if WDC and others are to be believed, another downturn may be coming.The same factors that helped WDC previously could now turn against it. For instance, exabytes shipped has jumped in recent quarters. This needs to be digested, which takes time and reduces demand. Better prices have helped recent earnings, but also encourages more supply. Supply gets ahead of demand and you get an oversupply.Quite a few people are bullish on stocks like WDC due to the perception that the need for storage is huge and will continue to remain so thanks to Big Data, 5G and so on. But this argument focuses too much on the demand side and not enough on the supply side. Demand for storage is growing, but technological progress has been able to advance even faster.For instance, Seagate is betting on HAMR to revolutionize HDD areal density. While WDC has not yet deployed MAMR as scheduled, it's improving its existing product lineup with the introduction of energy-assisted HDDs. NAND technology is progressing even faster. And whatever happens in NAND will inevitably affect HDDs since they're competitors.Technological progress has given bit supply growth an edge on bit demand growth. This pressures prices, which hurts suppliers. The NAND industry has been able to counter this downward pressure by exercising restraint with bit supply growth, particularly with fab capacity and process technology.This solution has worked okay thus far, but the entrance of YMTC may render it ineffective in the future. Unlike other suppliers, YMTC seems to be motivated by the desire to make sure that companies in China cannot be pressured through sanctions. The U.S. government is trying to restrict the supply of semiconductor chips to Chinese companies like Huawei. But this strategy becomes ineffective if China has domestic suppliers than can replace external suppliers. This is where YMTC comes in.YMTC ramping up capacity and technology forces competitors to do things they would probably not do otherwise. Like introducing new process nodes quicker. Intense competition will accelerate the pace of technological innovation, which benefits the consumer who gets more for less. But it will also aggravate the next downturn in an already worsening business environment.I am neutral on WDC. The industry looks to be heading for another downturn, not long after the previous one made its mark. The next downturn in NAND and the data storage industry by extension could not only last much longer than prior episodes, but could even force at least one player out of the market. What was done in the past to end a downturn may not work this time with YMTC around. The other option is a price war to reduce the competition.Six companies currently control the NAND market, but there may not be enough room for everyone to get out of the next downturn. At least some may have to go for the market to truly recover. Meanwhile, companies will have a tough time with earnings while the race is on for a new equilibrium. While WDC is likely to remain, weak quarterly earnings could be around for longer than before since time is needed to find an acceptable solution for market participants. Not the best of an environment for WDC."
4361053,103480,2020-07-27T13:06:47-04:00,"Shares of Western Digital have shed more than 30% this year on the expectation of lower demand for raw memory.
        To the contrary, however, Western Digital is expecting flash prices to continue trending upward.
        Read-through from Micron's most recent quarterly results through May confirm this trend.
        Western Digital is trading at an unheard-of forward P/E of 7.3x, below historical averages in the low teens.
        Though Western Digital has currently suspended its dividend, it previously paid out $0.50 per quarter - translating to just under 5% yield at current prices.","It's getting tough to find value in the tech sector. Virtually every software and internets stock has seen tremendous year-to-date gains, and the only places where true value is remaining is in some of the older pockets of the market, like Western Digital (WDC). The maker of memory and hard drives has seen troubled times this year, as investors bet that the coronavirus would sap demand for Western Digital components and push it into a down-cycle in a famously cyclical industry. Yet we note that while the memory stocks like Micron (MU) have nearly recouped all of its year-to-date losses (Micron is now down about 10%, faring much better than many financial and energy stocks in the Dow) - Western Digital has remained stubbornly low, off more than 35% year-to-date. This is in spite of the fact that the company has continue to turn out strong performance, and is even hinting at flash prices improving throughout the year.Western Digital is hardly the most exciting stock to invest in. Among chipmakers, it's far more exciting to invest in names like NVIDIA (NVDA) that has seen its fortunes rise and fall with the increasing popularity of both video games and bitcoin mining, and has seen its share price nearly double this year (taking NVIDIA to a forward P/E ratio above 70x). Western Digital, meanwhile - slower moving, but representing much better value - is a far more defensive play for investors concerned about a second wave of the market downturn. Western Digital has already lopped off nearly half of its value - and when we consider the strength in its fundamentals, I truly don't believe there's any lower for this stock to go.Stay long here and scope out a buying opportunity.The key message in Western Digital's near-term results is that it could have been a lot worse. In fact, when we look at the headline metrics for its fiscal third-quarter (covering the period ending in the first week of April), we don't see any red flags at all. See below:Figure 1. Western Digital Q3 summarySource: Western Digital Q3 earnings deckWestern Digital's revenue actually increased 14% y/y to $4.18 billion, while the company also substantially improved gross margins by 260bps and dramatically boosted its cash flow.When we look at the underlying business trends, we note that Western Digital's huge boost in flash revenues (now comprising about half of Western Digital's total revenue) was able to offset the expected decline in hard drive unit shipments.Figure 2. Western Digital performance by segmentSource: Western Digital Q3 earnings deckBut even among the shipments decline in hard drives, both flash and HDD saw ASP growth in the quarter. Of course, by now the March quarter is old news. Investors are looking ahead to fiscal Q4, which will contain three full months of coronavirus impact. But again here, there are several reasons for comfort.The first is by Western Digital's own admission. Speaking at an analyst conference hosted by Wells Fargo in June, CEO David Goeckeler noted as follows (transcript by Seeking Alpha):The key message here: flash is Western Digital's hero product, and management is currently expecting pricing to continuously strengthen. Prior memory cycles, meanwhile, have been marked by a rapid race to the bottom in pricing among the memory manufacturers and a corresponding drop in gross margins - neither of which seems to be happening for Western Digital. The second reason for confidence is positive read-through from other memory companies. Micron's fiscal quarterly reporting doesn't line up with Western Digital's, and Micron's fiscal third quarter results cover the period through the end of May (two months out of Western Digital's Q4.) Here we saw several positive trends:Similarly, SK Hynix - a South Korean competitor to both Micron and Western Digital - also recently released stronger-than-expected fiscal Q2 results, driven again by healthy pricing.Given both positive internal commentary from Western Digital management plus positive reassurance from other industry players, we think there's plenty of tailwinds heading into earnings season for Western Digital. Healthy pricing trends and margin improvements signal that this is hardly a down cycle for Western Digital as many investors had feared heading into the pandemic. It would be remiss and incomplete, however, not to mention one of the bearish drivers weighing on sentiment for Western Digital, and that's its huge debt position.As of the end of the fiscal third quarter, Western Digital had a staggering $9.77 billion in total debt, which represents a highly leveraged 5.0x Debt/EBITDA ratio (most banks consider ~3x leverage to be a risky, highly leveraged client)Figure 3. Western Digital debtSource: Western Digital Q3 earnings deckAgain here, however, there are counterweights that make us less concerned. We note that Western Digital has also suspended its $0.50/quarter dividend in the near term to focus on debt repayment. While that's not exciting news for investors, we like the fact that Western Digital in the past has paid out $2/year in dividends and if it were to resume that rate of dividends (fully supported, by the way, even by this year's trough EPS expectations of $3.03), at current prices Western Digital would yield just under 5%.Next year, Wall Street analysts are expecting consensus pro forma EPS of $5.84 for this company, which represents a 20% lift from FY19 EPS of $4.84 (and more than double what consensus is expecting for a challenging FY20). This puts Western Digital's forward P/E at 7.3x. Historically, meanwhile, Western Digital has traded closer to multiples in the mid-teens - it hovered in the $60 range for most of last year, for example, representing a ~13x multiple on eventual FY19 EPS of $4.84. I think a ~7x P/E multiple should be reserved for companies with only bad news to report - but with Western Digital's commentary on strong flash pricing and positive read-through from other memory companies, the reality is anything but frightening. Take advantage of this price dislocation to get a really good deal on this stock."
4371910,105014,2020-09-01T10:11:45-04:00,The bulk of WDC's business is on a secular decline trend.Volatility of Flash price causes wild swings in profitability and cash flow.A volatile cash flow and a leveraged balance sheet are a bad combination.Valuation is not attractive compared to peers.,"Western Digital's (WDC) share price collapsed from a high of slightly over $100 in March 2018 to around $38 recently. A new CEO came on board in March 2020. I decided to investigate if WDC represents an attractive value/turn-around play. The conclusion of the investigation is that about 60% of WDC's business is in a secular downtrend. In addition, the profitability and cash flow of the business are volatile as they are greatly influenced by the price of Flash memories. Furthermore, WDC has a debt leverage that is uncomfortable given the volatility of cash flow. As such, I passed on investing in WDC.WDC is in the worldwide data storage device and solution company. In F2020 just ended on July 3, WDC had revenues of $16.7 billion. WDC has about 300 million shares outstanding, trading recently at $38. With a net debt of $6.5 billion, the EV is around $17.9 billion. There are two trenches of convertibles, but conversion is only likely if WDC's shares trade well over $100. There is a $1.8 billion lease obligation related to the Flash Ventures (joint ventures with Kioxia to produce Flash memories) that is not carried on WDC's balance sheet. This is against a combined notes receivable and investment in Flash Ventures of $2.8 billion. WDC used to be a hard disk drive ""HDD"" company. In May 2016, WDC acquired SanDisk so that it can offer Flash-based solid-state drive ""SSD"" technology for storage applications. In June, S&P issued a BB+ rating with stable outlook, which is one notch below investment grade.WDC's served markets have three end applications and the details are shown in Figure 1. Client Devices segment serves personal computer ""PC"" and consumer electronics ""CE"" OEMs with HDD, SSD, Flash memories used in embedded applications, Flash wafer sales, licensing and others. Client Solutions segment serves mostly consumers with branded HDD, branded Flash and removables. Data Center Devices and Solution segment serves enterprise customers with HDD, SSD, data center SW and data center solutions.Figure 1: Revenue breakdown by end applications, Q4F20. Source: Company presentation.While Figure 1 provides a snapshot of the breakdown for the latest reporting quarter, the long-term trend is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2 shows that both the Client Solution and Client Devices segments are in a secular decline trend.Figure 2: Long term trend of revenue by end application. Source: Company presentations that accompanied quarterly results release.With about 60% of the business in a secular decline, it is no wonder that the overall revenue of WDC is also on a long-term declining trend. This is shown in Figure 3.Figure 3: WDC quarterly revenue trend. Source: Company presentations that accompanied quarterly results release.The long-term decline trend of Client Solution is driven by movement of data storage and backup to the cloud. As consumers, we know the Client Solution products as HDD and USB Flash drives that we buy at retail locations or on-line. With the advent of free or very low-cost cloud storage such as Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, Amazon and the like, consumers are increasingly storing their data, back-ups, photos and videos in the cloud, where access and sharing are very convenient.The Client Devices segment, which serves primarily the PC market and the CE market, is also on a secular decline trend. The PC market, which is the dominant user, declined from 352 million units in 2011 to 258 million units in 2018, a CAGR of -4.4%. The PC market saw a rare 2.7% growth in 2019 most likely driven by upgrades due to the loss of support of Windows 7. In 1Q2020, the PC market declined by 9.8% due to COVID-19 related supply chain disruption, and then grew by 2.8% in 2Q2020 due to increased demand as a result of WFH and remote learning. It is expected that after the 2Q bounce, the market will continue its long-term decline trend.The Data Center Device and Solution segment, which represents about 39% of the revenue, is the only segment that is not on a secular decline. However, it has not experienced much growth in the last three years as shown in Figure 2 above.WDC's overall revenue mix is shifting from HDD to SSD, which increases competition and volatility in profitability and cash flow. With years of consolidation, HDD suppliers have dwindled to three as shown in Figure 4.Figure 4. HDD market share 1Q2020. Source: Coughlin Associates.With a limited number of suppliers, supply demand balance has been rational, and WDC enjoys a steady gross margin for its HDD business. This is shown in the blue line of Figure 5.Figure 5: Gross margin by technology. Source: Company presentations that accompany quarterly results release.Figure 5 also highlights the gross margin volatility of the Flash-based SSD technology. Since the bulk of the costed SSD BOM is driven by the Flash content, SSD ASP is driven by the Flash ASP. The Flash market has many suppliers as shown in Figure 6. A high number of suppliers tend to drive a more volatile supply demand balance and hence a more volatile ASP as each supplier competes for market share.Figure 6: Market share of branded Flash suppliers. Source: TrendForce.The Flash gross margin cycle which peaked in Q2F18 (Figure 5) was driven by a tight supply demand balance, driving up ASP of Flash. When supply finally caught up with and overshot demand, Flash ASP collapsed. The ASP rebound in Q3F20 and Q4F20 was a head-fake caused by overstocking by OEMs against potential supply chain disruption caused by COVID-19 and trade tension. In addition, the sales of smartphone, which is the largest user of Flash, declined by 20% each in 1Q and 2Q. The combination of excess stocking and the smartphone sales decline resulted in an excess inventory in the smartphone supply chain, causing Flash ASP to drop. This is confirmed by management's guidance for Q1F21 (see Figure 5).The volatility in Flash ASP results in volatility in gross margin and cash flow. This is shown in Figure 7.Figure 7: Cash flow is driven by Flash gross margin. Source: Company presentations that accompany quarterly results release.The correlation between cash flow from ops and FCF with the Flash gross margin is very obvious from Figure 7. Since WDC has a limited control over the supply demand balance of the Flash market, it has limited control over its cash flow. It is very much like a company in the commodity oil and gas industry where its cash flow is driven by the actions of OPEC and Russia. In WDC's case, its cash flow is impacted by the capex decisions of other competitors, the demand of the smartphone market where it serves only in a very limited way. The only meaningful things that WDC can do are to reduce its fixed cost and control its capex, which it has been doing for the last several years. However, there is only so much fixed cost WDC can reduce, and it has to continue to invest in capex to maintain market share.WDC took on over $11 billion of debt when it acquired SanDisk. Soon after the SanDisk acquisition, the ASP of Flash went up as a result of a tight supply demand balance. WDC enjoyed a couple of years of increasing margin and cash flow. Rather than aggressively paying down debt, WDC decided to use the excess cash to purchase its own shares. WDC spent $1.15 billion to purchase its shares in 2018. WDC also continued to pay a $2 per share annual dividend (about $600 million per year) even when its FCF was not able to support the payment in 2019. WDC ended up increasing its debt to support the dividend payment. With the volatility of the profitability and cash flow, investors are concerned that WDC might violate its leverage ratio metric in its debt covenant, which is 3.5x for its Term Loan A-1. Figure 8 shows the net debt and various measures of debt leverage. With the way leverage is measure for the Term Loan, the leverage ratio went as high as 3.0x but trended down in the last quarter. However, with the looming decline in Flash ASP, investors are concerned.Figure 8. Net Debt and debt leverage based on several measures. Source: Company presentations that accompany quarterly results release.With the Chinese supplier YMTC ramping up capacity to satisfy China's demand, investors should be concerned with a potential looming supply glut. We have seen this kind of distortions in the memory market when a country decided to become a dominant player in the memory market. The subsequent price war was brutal. It is likely that this will happen again for the Flash market and it will be brutal for WDC, especially with its relatively leveraged balance sheet.After the new CEO came on board, WDC announced the suspension of its dividend on April 30, 2020. This is a late but wise move by the BoD to reduce the fixed charge. Hopefully, WDC can improve its balance sheet before the really brutal price war begins.At the current price of around $38, WDC shares are not in bargain territory. This is shown in Figure 9 where I chose Seagate (STX) and Micron (MU) as peers for comparison. STX competes in the HDD market and MU competes in the Flash SSD market. Figure 9 shows that WDC is not cheap by any metrics.Figure 9: Valuation comparison between WDC, STX and MU. Source: SA database.While management may be able to put together and execute a strategy to grow WDC and become less correlated to Flash ASP, its options are very limited due to a leveraged balance sheet. Flash ASP may surprise to the upside, but it is unlikely given the forgoing discussions on supply demand balance. There is a small risk to my thesis as WDC may be an acquisition candidate by another Flash supplier. However, I see that as very unlikely as such a deal is complex given the Flash Ventures situation with Kioxia and the baggage of the HDD business. As such, WDC is not a company I would put my money in at this time.Most of WDC's served markets are on a secular decline. Its profitability and cash flow are very correlated with the volatility of the ASP of Flash, which appears to be on another leg down. Longer term, Flash ASP may be on the cusp of a brutal price war due to the Chinese capacity expansion. WDC has a leveraged balance sheet. As such, its options for investment or acquisition for growth are rather limited. I plan to stay away as a potential investor."
4377604,103480,2020-10-05T10:45:00-04:00,"Shares of Western Digital are trading near year-to-date lows after a string of poor results.
        Read-through from Micron's most recent earnings release also spells trouble for Western Digital's flash business.
        Western Digital's dividend, suspended in April, was long bait for yield investors, but it remains suspended in order to prioritize heavier capex.
        With near-term challenges ahead, I've turned cautious on Western Digital.","Let's not mince words: it's going to be a tough year ahead for Western Digital (WDC), the storage vendor that manufactures both the more expensive, higher-performance flash memory as well as cheaper, older HDD technology. End-markets were surprisingly resilient for Western Digital amid the 2020 pandemic. The surge in work-from-home that led to an uptick in both consumer and enterprise purchases of new hardware helped Western Digital execute healthily amid the pandemic. But the question is if the near-term spikes, especially in enterprise demand, can be sustained: as we look ahead to 2020, the company has issued a soft outlook and investors are bracing for a bad year ahead.I had previously been bullish on Western Digital, touting the company's value amid stronger performance than expected in 2020. Yet now as we look ahead to 2021, a couple of new items have surfaced that make me less sanguine on Western Digital's prospects:In the memory sector, I'm leaning in on Micron due to the fact that NAND is a smaller piece of its business, and it has ~70% exposure on DRAM to rely on. But Western Digital has staked its future on high-margin flash, and at this juncture, I'm inclined to cut losses and sit out on the sidelines for Western Digital. Let's review Western Digital's most recent results, as well as what we learned from Micron about the year coming up. Western Digital's fourth-quarter earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Western Digital Q4 resultsSource: Western Digital Q4 earnings releaseThrough Q4, at the very least, Western Digital's results have been strong. The company generated $4.29 billion in revenue, growing 18% y/y (though slightly missing Wall Street's expectations of (+19% y/y) by a one-point margin. The biggest driver behind Western Digital's July quarter strength was a strong surge in data center/enterprise demand. As can be seen in the chart below, Western Digital generated $1.68 billion in revenue in its data center segment, growing 32% y/y. The company noted that this performance was driven by the continued work-from-home trend. Figure 2. Western Digital revenue trends by end marketSource: Western Digital Q4 earnings deckThe outlook going forward, however, is shaky. For Q1, Western Digital is guiding to only $3.7-$3.9 billion in revenue - which would suggest revenue contracting to -8% y/y to -3% y/y. Consensus, on the other hand, had hoped for revenue to grow at 8% y/y instead, one of the sharpest divergences between expectations and guidance. This suggests that some of the strength Western Digital saw in Q4 may have been a pull-forward in demand. Enterprises reacted quickly to the work-from-home trend, loading up on technology to ensure business continuity. But moving ahead to Western Digital's Q1 and forward, these knee-jerk purchases may moderate and Western Digital's overall results will be dragged down by its weaker client solutions segment, which has been pummeled due to closures in the brick-and-mortar stores that carry Western Digital's storage products.David Goeckeler, Western Digital's CEO, sounded off a very cautious tone on forward-looking demand, echoing the weak Q1 guidance, on the Q4 earnings call:Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron's CEO, more or less echoed the expectations of weaker enterprise demand going forward in Micron's fourth-quarter earnings call, which happened almost two months after Western Digital's:The key point we learned from Micron is that it views enterprise inventory levels as elevated, which confirms the thesis that Western Digital's Q4 was unnaturally benefited from bulk enterprise purchases that will be difficult to sustain.Another red flag that we picked up from Micron's more recent data: NAND (flash) ASPs are weakening. For Micron, NAND ASPs declined in the ""upper single digit"" percentages in the August-end quarter versus the May-end quarter, which signals that flash pricing for Western Digital may be the big impediment driving expected revenue declines in Q1.For Micron, this is less of a concern because ~70% of its business is in DRAM, which has seen more stable pricing. Flash, however, is Western Digital's key growth focus (in Q4, flash revenue was up 49% y/y while HDD revenue declined -4% y/y; the two product categories had a roughly 50-50 split of Q4 overall revenue). And not only is flash the faster-growing segment for Western Digital, but it's also the more profitable one: Q4 flash gross margins were about three points richer at 30.5% versus 27.2% for hard drives. Adding insult to injury is that in spite of (or perhaps, because of) a weak expected FY21, Western Digital plans to ramp up capex spending. The company is planning to spend $3.1 billion in capex in FY21, up ~35% versus $2.3 billion in FY20 and in-line with its peak year of capex spend in FY19.Figure 3. Western Digital capex forecastSource: Western Digital Q4 earnings deckWestern Digital has defended these capex moves as necessary to keep up with technological change - but while this may be true, the casualty is Western Digital's dividend, which remains indefinitely suspended for FY21. See the company's capital allocation strategy for the upcoming year captured in the slide below:Figure 4. Western Digital capital allocationSource: Western Digital Q4 earnings deckWith expectations of weaker flash pricing in fiscal 2021 (which was partially confirmed by Micron's Q4 results) plus the fact that enterprise demand may be soft due to existing high inventories, I'd be cautious of Western Digital going forward."
4321055,96246,2020-02-04T09:22:00-05:00,Western Digital comments on their earnings bode well for Micron.Both benefit from similar trends.Micron has more upside than Western Digital.,"Western Digital (NYSE:WDC) put up strong results. WDC is more exposed to NAND while Micron (NASDAQ:MU) is one-third exposed to NAND. WDC cited strong industry dynamics helping their numbers improve. Similar trends should benefit Micron.Recent HistoryWe went to a Buy Rating from Neutral on WDC on Dec. 12 (paywall).SourceAbove you can see where we got more bullish. Here's what we said at the time:This story has been playing out. 5G and Apple are coming on along with other drivers I'll talk about below. You saw me above get excited about pricing which you'll see below was a core driver to their earnings taking the stock higher.I do think short term it's a little more fully valued but I think that medium term there's still upside. I'll explain.Strong Memory PricingWestern Digital had strong comments on pricing. Since memory companies are cyclical, pricing matters very much. In fact pricing is the single most important datapoint for me when doing work on WDC and Micron.Here's what Western Digital said on pricing:You hear them saying it here that the ""pricing environment"" is going to be a ""margin enhancement"" this year.WDC is expecting a big margin turnaround now thanks to pricing.Here's their guide.SourceThey guided to 29% gross margins. Look how that compares to their trend. It's a big jump.Source: Elazar Advisors models with data from Western DigitalAbove you see the year-over-year trend go from negative 18% a few quarters ago to now up 4.1% in their guided March quarter.You see how we model gross margins thereafter based on the improving two-year trend. They also said on their earnings call that gross margins could reach 35%-40% later this year.Based on their guide gross margins plan to go from -5.4% year-over-year to +4.1% in one quarter's time. That's a 9.5% swing in one quarter which is huge.The main driver is a combination of demand picking up and weak supply.Here's what they said:Sweet words from a cyclical.Demand is picking up. Some of that may be because customers see tight supply so they have to increase orders to make sure they get what they need.That's how cyclicals work. Under-ordering leads producers to cut production. Then there's tight supply. Then you have over-ordering, sending prices up. Then producers chase prices with more production. Supply catches up then prices turn back down.We're back in the up-cycle where pricing is starting to move up which is the key beneficiary to the P&L.Micron Benefits From Western Digital's TrendsI view all this as support for the Micron thesis that they too are seeing similar trends.SourceAbove you see from Micron's earnings presentation that they are 28% NAND and 2/3 DRAM. I will say that memory trends tend to move together because they have many of the same end customers -datacenter, mobile, gaming, etc.So tech needs memory, both NAND and DRAM, so general tech trends drive them both.You heard WDC talk about pricing trends above. Here's the DRAM chart seeing similar strength.SourceAbove you see DRAM prices taking off. That's benefiting Micron gross margins and earnings. I believe you have to stay on top of the datapoints to make sure your thesis is coming to fruition. WDC's pricing comments match DRAM pricing trends and is another confirmation things are continuing in the right direction.Again, these pricing trends are as critical as you get for both Micron and WDC.China Health IssuesThe health issues in China are a very tough story and we wish a speedy end to the spread of this problem.China is very important to both Micron and WDC. Demand reduction is a risk to overall tech. But I believe they'll find a cure soon or the epidemic will slow down.For this reason though I think there's a shot we get buying opportunities in both of these stocks.I also think the combination of China health issues with the a potential Fed taper of their big repo buying support can give us decent buying opportunities. The Fed pulling back on quantitative easing type actions can soften up the market.Upside and ConclusionCurrently I have WDC at about fair value. (Full model: Paywall). For Micron I have much more upside with an $85 12 month target (Full model: Paywall).So I'm more bullish on Micron than WDC but think both benefit from the trends and both are worth looking for buying opportunities."
4322947,77985,2020-02-10T18:57:44-05:00,"Markets were pleased to hear that both HDD and flash margins improved in Q2 and WDC expects more of the same in its outlook.WDC thinks that flash margins could double before the end of 2020 thanks to a shortage with demand growth exceeding supply growth.Bit growth has slowed down thanks to manufacturers holding back, but higher margins give them an incentive to let go of these restraints.WDC has set ambitious goals, which depend in part on what others do, some of whom may have no interest in high margins like WDC.","Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) released its Q2 quarterly report on January 30. The report revealed a substantial improvement in margins in comparison to the quarter before. In addition, the outlook calls for an accelerated recovery in the flash market. But there is reason to think that the recovery in margins may prove to be fleeting and not sustainable in the long run. Why that is will be covered next in greater detail.WDC managed to improve its top and bottom line in Q2 compared to Q1. While the company has ways to go if we go by YoY comparisons, the trend looks encouraging in the table below. Margins aren't where they used to be, but they seem to heading in the right direction. They are a substantial improvement over Q2 when margins were lower.The HDD segment contributed $2,396M out of $4,234M in revenue. Flash contributed the remaining $1,838M. The HDD segment is in better shape with margins of 30.8% in Q2. On the other hand, flash is lagging with margins of 19.5%. Flash is more of a pressing issue than the HDD segment.Source: WDC Form 8-KWDC is optimistic about the outlook for the rest of the year. The forecast calls for revenue of $4.1-4.3B in Q3. Margins are expected to show further improvement, with GAAP margins of 24.5-25.5% and non-GAAP margins of 28.5-29.5%.WDC credits the progress made to several factors. As far as WDC is concerned, flash has bottomed, and the market is expected to continue to improve. From the Q2 earnings call:A transcript of the Q2 FY2020 earnings call can be found here.Inventories have decreased in both the HDD and flash segment, a sign that demand is solid.HDD margins increased due to several factors.WDC has a cost advantage in HDDs, and that helps with margins.WDC leads in the enterprise market in terms of market share, which is an advantage with demand in the enterprise market stronger than other market segments. That gives margins a lift.The company's position in the enterprise market is also the reason why WDC believes there is room for HDD margins to improve over time. HDD margins could over time go from the low thirties to the mid-thirties.However, flash is where WDC sees the greatest scope for margin improvement. WDC thinks that flash margins could as much as double before the end of 2020 and possibly as soon as calendar Q3.The reason why WDC is so optimistic about flash is because the company expects there to be a shortage of NAND flash memory chips. The shortage will be the result of demand running ahead of supply. WDC is already seeing some pockets of tightness in the market that it thinks will increase as the year progresses.These statements make it clear that flash will perform a crucial role in determining what kind of year 2020 will be for WDC. The HDD segment could see some improvement, but it's the flash segment that is expected to see the greatest amount of change. Flash margins could double in just a few quarters. If this happens, earnings should get quite a boost. But the reverse could also happen if supply growth exceeds demand growth.Flash memory prices have increased in recent months. Part of the reason why has to do with disruptions in production. For instance, a power failure last June at a Japanese plant owned by Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF)/Kioxia led to a temporary shutdown. More recently, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Kioxia had to temporarily halt chip production due to a fire breaking out.More importantly, NAND manufacturers have cut production, reduced capex spending, and slowed down capacity expansions. The list of NAND manufacturers include Samsung, Toshiba/Kioxia, Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Western Digital, SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and a few smaller ones. These measures have greatly reduced the growth in bit shipments, even though manufacturers continue to increase flash supply by transitioning to more advanced flash architectures featuring a greater number of layers on each chip. As a result, flash demand growth has had a chance to narrow the gap with supply growth.However, this balancing of the memory market could fall apart the more prices rise and margins improve. If WDC margins are to reach the forties, flash manufacturers have to keep production in check. But as margins rise, manufacturers have less incentive to keep production constrained. Manufacturers like Samsung have seen most of their earnings evaporate during the down cycle in the memory market. They may be tempted to capitalize once prices have improved to a certain degree in an attempt to raise earnings.If some or all manufacturers raise production to capitalize on higher profit margins, supply goes up. At some point, supply could surpass demand. Excess supply will push down flash prices and lower margins for everyone, WDC included.Source: Wikimedia CommonsWDC still has some areas it needs to work on. For instance, WDC is in the red if we look at GAAP numbers. Nevertheless, the company has made progress on a number of fronts. New product releases and technological upgrades are some of the achievements made. Q2 saw margins improve, which WDC expects to continue in its Q3 forecast.Both the HDD and flash segments are expected to see improvement, but WDC sees the latter as having the greatest scope for further improvement. WDC believes that flash margins could more than double before the end of 2020. Such a huge jump in margins will inevitably boost earnings at WDC if it manages to hit those numbers.However, the recent recovery in the flash market is dependent on flash manufacturers hitting the brakes on bit growth. Without those voluntary reductions in production, capex spending and capacity expansions, bit growth could have been much higher. If more supply had entered the market, prices would be under increased pressure.As prices rise and margins improve, manufacturers may be tempted to take advantage of the situation and cash in by raising production. Increased production will at some point push down prices and margins by extension. It's difficult to see how WDC can keep other manufacturers from ramping up bit growth to keep flash margins in the forties for any extended period of time. WDC may be able to reach the forties for a while, but not for an extended period of time.Not when you have six different manufacturers competing with each other for a slice of the pie. Furthermore, new competitors are looking to establish themselves in the flash market. These new entrants have different motivations and are much less inclined to keep production constrained, even if that means prices will fall. This article delves deeper into this issue.The results in the HDD segment are noteworthy, but it's also a fact that the HDD market is in decline and in danger of being eclipsed by flash memory. It's not unreasonable to say that NAND flash memory is the future of storage. So, what happens with flash should be of the utmost importance.For prices to recover, manufacturers must hold back. But once prices recover, there's no longer the urge to hold back, and things go back to square one. This cycle looks unlikely to end anytime soon. WDC may be able to temporarily hit high margins, but it will be hard-pressed to keep them there.With this in mind, I am neutral on WDC. The goal of margins in the forties looks very ambitious and is dependent on what other companies do. WDC may have trouble doubling their flash margins, and it's almost certain they will not stay there for any long period of time before competition forces them to go down once more."
4334906,105622,2020-03-30T07:28:53-04:00,Western Digital continues to dominate the HDD market.Acquisitions and growth will help the firm expand SSD market share.Shares are undervalued and current macro doesn't change future outlook.,"Editor's note: Seeking Alpha is proud to welcome Emily Levine as a new contributor. It's easy to become a Seeking Alpha contributor and earn money for your best investment ideas. Active contributors also get free access to SA PREMIUM. Click here to find out more »Western Digital Corp (WDC), a leader in the hard disk drive (HDD) market, has become an increasingly competitive player in the solid state drive (SSD) market since its purchase of Sandisk in 2016. Even though Western Digital commands the HDD market, that technology has recently become an afterthought to many PC manufacturers who favor the SSD. SSD’s have important performance benefits versus the older spinning disc media and as a result, HDDs have lost their luster for both PCs and some smaller-scale servers. Because of this shift, Western Digital is unlikely to generate prolific returns on capital on HDDs. However, they are very well primed to make a substantial run in the SSD market. Thus far, Western Digital has been largely ineffective at translating its success into the SSD market. This should change in the near future. Western Digital remains in a strong position to continue to capitalize on the hard drive market, and the firm should be able to drive further revenue growth with a strong portfolio of nearline enterprise HDDs along with the further growth in SSDs.The stock has certainly taken its fair share of beatings in the last few months. Year to date shares were down 53% and an astonishing 51% in the last month alone to around ~$31 per share before recouping some losses. A little pullback is warranted, but fundamentals would suggest the stock is a strong value play at this point in time. The firm sports very strong P/B and P/S ratios of 1.1 and 0.6 respectively, compared to industry averages of 2.4 and 1.7. A forward dividend yield of 6.85% adds even more value to this play, and the company has yet to miss a dividend payment. The impact of COVID-19 on the core business should be marginal. Storage is an inherently cyclical market, and though supply chains may be briefly halted, PC and data center businesses will continue to have demand for the storage offered by WDC. (Image Source: Meta-charts)Western Digital is in a great spot to continue to benefit from the proliferation of the “Internet of Things”, 5G, and surveillance which should continue to rapidly increase large scale storage demand from enterprises. While the HDD does continue to slowly fade in favor of the SSD, the HDD’s price point continues to be compelling for large scale storage required by many firms, and Western Digital has only one major competitor in that field, Seagate (STX); together they maintain north of 80% HHD market share. There will be a time when SSD pricing is at or below the level of HDD pricing. Prices have declined from $50 per gig of storage in 2005 to around $.40 in 2018. They still have a while to go; HDD’s can be as cheap as $.03 per gig, and Western Digital will continue to benefit from this price difference as it markets huge sums of storage to firms engaged in the modern commodity of the Internet of Things.(Source: The Register)While the large scale storage business should continue to grow in the coming years, PC remains Western Digital’s primary market for storage. On this front, the shift to SSD seems to be occurring at a much faster pace due to a decline in yearly PC sales and the need for innovation. Many mobile PCs use SSD storage, and the proportion of SSD-based laptops will likely increase materially over the next few years. This will not be limited to mobile PCs, and it’s expected that the preponderance of desktops will also use SSD storage over the medium to longterm. In 2018, almost half of HDD units sold by Western come from desktop and notebook sales and thus the importance of a strong SSD portfolio to capture that shift cannot be understated. It does look like Western will be in a good position not only to continue to innovate the HDD but to also expand and improve their SSD offerings.In May 2016, Western acquired SSD giant SanDisk for $19 billion. Shareholders were mostly positive about the move, which has the firm better positioned to deal with the technological shift. While the firm has expanded its share of the PC SSD market to 14%, there does exist some uncertainty about how well Western will be able to shove its foot into the SSD market and become a major player. Major players such as Samsung (KRX:005930), Intel (INTC) and Micron (MU) are mainstays in the industry. However, because of the recent consolidation in the market, the firm should be able to continue to expand this portion of their offerings. While strong competition will be a challenge for the firm, they have already shown they can compete at a baseline level; from this point on it will be about strategic growth.(Source: Statista)Western Digital remains a recommended buy due to its domination in the HDD market that will continue to have demand for large scale storage. While competition exists in the SSD market, and to this point, Western Digital hasn’t excelled in its rollout of SSD and flash storage, demand is increasing and Western has slowly increased its market share. They will be well-positioned to transition many of their HDD PC customers into SSD storage. The Sandisk acquisition should continue to pay dividends as it helps increase its stake in the NAND market. Also, Western’s move to bring manufacturing of SSD in house with the acquisition of Telgile, a designer and producer of SSD arrays for data centers, should help them continue to improve their SSD share. Revenue should also bounce back in 2020 even in the face of Coronavirus, as 2019 revenue was marred by nearly 20% due to weaker NAND pricing and HDD headwinds.The stock is undervalued by almost every ratio and metric, it sports a high yield, and the company is well poised for a successful run. WDC is a strong buy."

There may be some fundamental reasons for this improving outlook, with signs of improving pricing for NAND flash memory.You can now track all of my free Seeking Alpha articles on this Google Spreadsheet I have created.There have recently been two articles written in Digitimes which suggest that the pricing for NAND memory will improve in 2020. One report was written on December 19, noting that the NAND flash contract prices may rise by up to 15% in the first quarter of 2020. Another article was written on January 2, suggesting that contract prices could increase by up to 40% this year.Higher prices could certainly help Western Digital, and it could be one reason why some traders are betting the recent equity rally continues. The $75 call options saw their open interest levels for expiration on March 20 rise by around 9,000 contracts on January 3. According to the data from Trade Alert, the calls traded on the Ask, and indicate that the options were bought, and are betting that Western Digital's stock will rise. The options traded for roughly $1.50 per contract, and that means the stock would need to rise to $76.50 or higher for the trader to earn a profit.The chart shows that the stock is nearing a big break-out should it rise above resistance in the $65.75 to $66 range. If that happens, the stock may rise to the next level of resistance at approximately $75.65. The stock appears to have formed a double bottom in December 2018 and June 2019, a bullish reversal pattern. It has set up what appears to be a longer-term uptrend in the stock.Additionally, the relative strength index is pointing to higher prices over the longer term. The RSI has been steadily trending higher since September of 2018. It, too, suggests that the stock has longer-term uptrend that formed in it.However, should the stock not be able to break-out and rise above $65.75, then it could be heading lower to $57.35. Additionally, an analyst at Benchmark recently noted a better pricing environment for NAND, but that it might not provide a benefit to Western Digital. The analyst noted that inventory levels were still high. It seems currently based on the technical chart and some option betting, investors and traders are thinking a better pricing environment for NAND led to a higher stock price for Western Digital. The next few weeks will be telling regarding the future direction of the stock, which at the moment appears to be higher."

As the company navigates past a cyclical trough, markets instead reacted negatively to the CEO’s retirement. This irrational reaction will prove short-lived: storage demand for both physical drives (“HDDs”) and the faster SSDs will continue growing. At 7.8 times forward P/E and a debt/equity of 1.07 times, WDC shares trade at an attractive valuation. The dividend yields 3.97%, an added bonus.Western Digital earned $0.34 a share (non-GAAP) as revenue fell 19.7% to $4.04 billion. But the downside EPS of $0.45-$0.65, below the $0.75 consensus, spooked investors. The near-term headwind will prove short-lived because HDD and SSD margins are improving. The decline in flash revenue ended in Q1F20 and non-GAAP gross margins are bottoming at 20%:Source: WDCIn the last quarter, bit shipments grew 9% sequentially while the average retail unit capacity rose 29% Y/Y. Western Digital forecasts flash industry supply bit growth in the low-30% range Y/Y in the calendar 2020.Source: WDCConversely, total HDD exabytes rose 23% sequentially while the average ASP per drive rose 7%. Capacity enterprise Exabyte shipments rose 60% Y/Y. Exabyte growth in calendar 2020 is similar to that of the SSD market, up in the mid-30% range Y/Y. Even though markets are forward-looking, it is ignoring the strong demand for storage, especially in the data center. Western Digital expects significant shipments for its 14-terabyte capacity drives. It has a 70-75% market share and faces little competitive pressures.Still, Seagate (STX) is making a big push by challenging WDC in the capacity enterprise space. Yet volume shipments for the 18 terabyte drive looms. A sampling of the drive by the end of this year will follow with the start of 18TB shipments next year. And if Seagate makes inroads in its market, the company may launch 16 TB drives to defend its market share.WDC reported notable Y/Y declines throughout.Source: WDCBut if secular trends of the growth and value of data persist at a faster pace, its EPS will increase. Management set a goal of taking out around $100 million in operating expenses quarterly. It accomplished that but still has some incentive compensation to account for. In the medium term, the lower operating cost level combined with demand growth in the 35% range will lead to improving profitability.Given the first half of calendar 2020 will be seasonally slower period, expect a buildup in inventory. This will minimize Western Digital’s margin recovery in the near-term. But as it moves through the back half of the year, better prices, improved demand-supply dynamic, and strong demand for the flash business will result in better overall full-year results.As I previously mentioned, the CEO’s exit is a non-event. He will stay on board and will actively engage with the company until a replacement is found. It may take another six months before WDC gets new leadership. Either way, WDC has a healthy product portfolio. In the second half, it expects to see accelerating improvements in gross margins. Demand in new areas, such as enterprise SSDs and game consoles, will offset a slowdown in its more mature products.Source: WDCAlthough it is too early to predict, a product refresh in smartphones, driven by 5Gs, may give storage cards and SSDs a lift.Investors may assume revenue growing by no more than 3% annually:Source: finbox.io (click on the link to change revenue projections)In a 5-year DCF Revenue Exit model, even at a pessimistic discount rate of 11% and higher working capital and capital expenditure, the fair value is over $70 a share. Despite my optimism that the stock is trading at a steep discount, technology stocks as a whole may underperform. The market is due for a mild correction since the S&P 500 (SPY) is up by over 25% YTD. Any increase in negative sentiment will give bears an excuse to beat WDC's stock lower. If that happens, value investors should consider buying the stock more aggressively."
4308883,104882,2019-11-24T22:36:48-05:00,"Western Digital has seen a pullback following the solid six-month run-up, but may have trouble pushing to new highs, at least in the short term.An approximately 12% upside potential and 8% projected downside make WDC a Hold along with its 4% annual dividend yield in my opinion.Catalysts such as the need for increased hard drive storage with next generation consoles should eventually push stock prices higher for investors willing to wait out this long-term play.","I last wrote on Western Digital Corporation (WDC) back in January, pointing out the undervaluation in the stock and the potential for returns for patient investors. The stock has since delivered well over 50% gains and now rests just below the $50 price range following the declines after the announcement that CEO Steve Milligan is planning to retire. The stock now trades right alongside peers and has very few major catalysts in sight over the next year for the microchip sector (Figure 1). Due to this relative valuation I only see around 12% upside potential over the next few quarters with as much as 8% downside, which is why I am currently recommending to Hold Western Digital stock at these prices.(Figure 1) Western Digital Boasts A Wide Variety Of Technology Hardware Within Their PortfolioFollowing the recent pullback from 52-week highs there still remains potential in Western Digital's stock. The risk has definitely increased though, as WDC now trades at a slight premium to competitors (Figure 2).Data by YCharts(Figure 2) Western Digital Is Trading Slightly Higher Than Peers When Looking At Price To Earnings RatioThe stock does still have an average price target of $62, but you could very well see downgrades in the future as the company has struggled with growth of late. WDC did beat well on Q1 EPS and revenue at the end of October only to have the market react with a $10+ decline due to management changes and weaker-than-expected guidance. I believe this has been an overreaction for the most part and that Western Digital could easily overcome this dip and return to around the $52 short term if the negative sentiment can be lifted. The key to this will be focusing on the few upcoming catalysts in the sector and establishing a management shift that will give investors confidence for the future.One foreseeable catalyst looks to be the release of upcoming consoles and their impact on the cyclical nature of hard drive disk sales. The expected release of next gen consoles in late 2020 could act as a boost to hard drive sales as more advanced, higher resolution games take up more space and will therefore, in theory, need more external storage. This to me is one of the strongest cases for a run-up next year for WDC and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), but will definitely be a long-term play. Analysts are estimating huge growth in 2021 and 2022 for WDC and it is catalysts like this that will help to fuel that growth going forward.One risk that has seemed to always hang around WDC is the company's significant long-term debt value. The debt currently sits around $10.4 billion and is not a huge issue for coming quarters, but should be monitored by long-term investors (Figure 3).(Figure 3) Debt Maturity From Company's Q1 Earnings PresentationAnother risk that comes up is the safety of the 4% annual dividend, one of the highest in the technology sector. Following earnings the dividend payout ratio has reached the highest percent the company has seen in years at 78%. I do not believe this is currently an issue with over a billion dollars in free cash flow, but may be something to watch in the future along with the debt.Based upon the risks at hand and following what has already been a significant pullback, I do not see much more room for significant downside, barring any unforeseen macroeconomic headwinds. An approximately 8% potential for downside seems reasonable for the short-midterm timeline as I do not see WDC falling much below the ~$44 floor it held pretty well this spring.Western Digital Corp. has seen a strong 6-month turnaround up until recent weeks. Uncertainty has dragged the stock down, leaving room for a small increase if the stock can find its footing. This room for ~12% upside potential and a 4% annual dividend make it worth to me to Hold WDC's stock, but I cannot yet recommend a buy with increased risk on the horizon. Long term (1.5-2.5 years), this stock should produce solid returns with the release of a new generation of consoles and hopefully an end to the trade war uncertainty nearly in sight as well. Until then investors should watch the debt and wait for a slightly better entry point that I do believe will come in time.Short-Term (6-9 month) Price Point Recommendations:Sell: $54+Hold: $44-$54Buy: $44-"
4323031,102404,2020-02-11T06:14:40-05:00,"In May 2016, I bought Western Digital due to its high dividend yield, the low valuation and the technical picture.But I don't want to hold Western Digital for the long term as it is a cyclical company without pricing power.Nevertheless, cyclical companies can also be a good investment and Western Digital outperformed the S&P 500 over the long run.","In the past few years, I have been trying to focus on a particular type of company – stable business model, high levels of consistency and wide economic moat around the business. But sometimes I am writing about companies which don’t fit these criteria and, in some cases, these stocks are even part of my portfolio.(Source: Pixabay)One of the companies that doesn’t fit these criteria, but of which I have been a shareholder from 2016 till 2020 is Western Digital Corporation (WDC). I already covered Western Digital in the past and my last article was quite bullish at a time when I should have been rather bearish. And now – almost two years later – I will provide another update on the company and the stock, and before I look at the reasons why I bought Western Digital in 2016 and why I sold it last week (although I actually should have sold it in 2018), we take a brief look at the business and the quarterly results.Western Digital develops, manufactures and sells data storage devices as well as data storage solutions. It offers hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs), for example, for desktop and notebook personal computers, gaming consoles, mobile phones, tablets and other wearable devices. In the second quarter, revenue from HDD was $2,396 million, while revenue from flash was $1,838 million.(Source: Western Digital Investor Presentation)Compared to the first quarter of 2020, revenue could be increased about 5%. But compared to the same quarter last year, revenue was basically flat. The adjusted earnings per share could also be increased compared to the previous quarter, but declined 57% compared to the same quarter last year.(Source: Western Digital Investor Presentation)Western Digital is reporting in three different segments:When I bought Western Digital Corporation in 2016, the reasons were quite simple. First of all, in May 2016, we had witnessed a sell-off that started at the beginning of 2015, and within 16 months, Western Digital had lost about 70% of its market capitalization. One of the reasons for this decline was probably the announced acquisition of SanDisk, which market participants and investors saw with a lot of skepticism. Western Digital paid about $19 billion for SanDisk, which led to higher debt levels for Western Digital, and in July 2016, Western Digital had $13.6 billion in long-term debt and a $3 billion bridge loan on its balance sheet. And now – about 3.5 years later - $9.5 billion in long-term debt remained, which is leading to a debt-equity-ratio of 1.05. When considering the cash and cash equivalents the company has on its balance sheet, about $6.7 billion in debt would remain. And although Western Digital has to pay out $90-95 million in interest every quarter, we still should not be concerned about the debt levels.The result of this drawdown was a really undervalued stock (in my opinion) that was trading with a P/E ratio between 6 and 7 (when using the earnings per share from 2015, the last fiscal results at this point). Of course, the P/E ratio can be misleading for cyclical companies, but Western Digital was not only undervalued at that point in time, it had also an attractive dividend yield above 5%. And finally, from a technical point of view, the stock was at a strong support level indicating a potential turnaround. Not only was Western Digital supported by the 200-month exponential moving average (red line), but we also saw a pullback to the orange trendline, which has been in place since the highs of 1997.Aside from these aspects making May 2016 a good entry point for Western Digital, the long-term growth potential for Western Digital was quite appealing. With people taking more and more pictures, creating more and more videos, streaming movies and series and companies collecting data about customers, the demand for storage solutions will rise. These are only a few examples why storage capacity is needed, but the biggest driver of revenue growth might be the Internet of Things leading to a massive demand for data storage solutions. Many items we know will communication and start collecting data – our cars, the refrigerator, wristbands people wear and so on. In the last quarter, total exabytes sold could increase only 1% with Flash exabytes sold increasing 24% and HDD exabytes sold decreasing 1%. But in the past three quarters, Western Digital could report growth rates for exabytes sold increasing between 11% and 22% year-over-year. And while demand for exabytes will probably continue to increase, the average selling price is also important and it has been declining in most quarters in the recent past.A final argument for Western Digital could be an aspect, I probably didn’t pay as much attention to four years ago as I should have – the industry dynamics and the competitive situation between the different companies operating in the same industry. In retrospect, Western Digital might also have been a good pick as it is operating in an oligopoly. The HDD market is still controlled by three different companies, and back in May 2016, Western Digital was still market leader with a market share of about 43% followed by Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) with a market share of 39.38% and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) (OTCPK:TOSYY) with a market share of about 17%. In 2019, Western Digital lost its pole position (market share of 35.4%) while Toshiba gained market shares and is now controlling 24.4% of the market with Seagate being market leader now (40.2% market share). Generally speaking, a low number of competitors within an industry is good for the individual companies as it usually reduces price competition and this could be a final reason to invest in Western Digital.There were several reasons to buy Western Digital Corporation in May 2016 and I don’t regret buying the stock as the investment generated an annualized return of 16.5% (or even 19.7% when including dividends). But I don’t want to hold Western Digital as a long-term investment for reasons I will now describe.One of the reasons I don’t want to own Western Digital as a long-term investment is the cyclicality of the business. I am not saying that cyclical stocks can’t be great investments because they absolutely can be – and especially when buying at the right point one can easily outperform the market. However, it is not the kind of stock I like to own, and in the third quarter of 2019, I already kicked Cal-Maine Foods (CALM) out of my portfolio (another cyclical stock).Aside from the cyclicality, which is influencing the demand for the product, the missing economic moat is another problem as it is leading to missing pricing power. Although the company is operating in an oligopoly in its HDD business (see section above), Western Digital doesn’t have pricing power as it is selling a commodity. And it is extremely difficult to achieve product differentiation with a commodity; a customer tends to buy the cheapest hard disk drive or flash drive as price is usually the most important buying criteria when choosing between very similar products where it is difficult for the laymen to see any differences.And finally, I see the risk of the overall market declining in the near future and this will most likely draw Western Digital down with it – especially as technology companies often see steep declines (much steeper than the overall market). I know I have been warning for several quarters and it hasn’t happened so far, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn't be cautious. And after the recent price rally, a correction for Western Digital doesn’t seem to be unlikely.Western Digital is not the kind of company I like to hold for the long term as it is missing two important aspects I like to see in every investment: stability and consistency over time, and Western Digital as a cyclical business has neither. But that doesn’t mean Western Digital can’t be a good investment.Over the last decade, Western Digital has returned 68% while the S&P 500 returned 212%, and Western Digital was definitely not a good investment over that time.Data by YChartsHowever, when looking at the last 20 years, the picture is completely different: the S&P 500 returned only 136% during that time frame while Western Digital increased 1,310%.Data by YChartsWhen looking at the last 30 years, Western Digital returned 1,390% while the S&P 500 returned about 902%.Data by YChartsThis shows two different things. First of all, Western Digital could outperform the S&P 500 over the long run, but we also see that it depends on the time frame if Western Digital underperformed or outperformed the S&P 500 as it is a very cyclical business.Aside from the stock performance, we can look at another metric – the return on invested capital – as it also shows the cyclicality of the business as well as the fact that Western Digital Corporation can be a great investment at certain points in time. In the years between 2010 and 2015, Western Digital could report high numbers for return on invested capital (in 2013, the RoIC was only 10.31% while in 2010 it was as high as 31.57% with the other years being in between – mostly around 15-20%). But after 2016, the RoIC was never higher than 5%.In order to decide if Western Digital is a good investment, we can also calculate the intrinsic value. As it is a cyclical business, we should take the average free cash flow of the last 10 years as a basis, which should reflect the cyclicality of the business and give us a realistic number we can use for a calculation. Over the last decade, the free cash flow was $1,872 million on average, and when taking that number as well as a modest growth rate of 3% for the years to come and until perpetuity, we get an intrinsic value of $91 for Western Digital, making the stock still undervalued.As I have mentioned above, I sold Western Digital last week, although the stock could still be trading below its fair, intrinsic value. But with the cyclicality, the missing moat and missing pricing power, it is just not a stock I like to own for the long term. And with an annual yield of almost 20% for the time I owned the stock, I figured it is a good time for me to sell and invest the money in a company I prefer to hold for the long term.However, this brings us to another problem. In the last six months, I sold three positions and stocks I had in my portfolio (the only selling I did for a very long time) and the money (gains as well as initial investment) from these three investments – Stericycle (NASDAQ:SRCL), Cal-Maine Foods and Western Digital Corporation – are increasing the cash reserves and I don’t really know what to do with it as it is getting harder and harder to find great long-term investments, which are not overvalued. As part of my Marketplace, I have a watchlist of more than 20 high-quality companies with a wide economic moat, but among these companies only a few seem to be undervalued and a good investment right now. Two names that rank very high on this list are CVS Health Corporation (CVS), which is still undervalued in my opinion, and 3M Company (MMM), which is now trading very close to its intrinsic value. Additionally, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) which I covered recently might also be interesting, although it doesn’t have a wide economic moat around its business."

On the one hand, actual earnings were not great with another net loss for the quarter. In many ways, FQ4 was worse than the quarter before. On the other hand, WDC sounded very optimistic in the earnings call with its outlook. WDC gave a lot of reasons why it feels that way.It can be difficult for some people to get a handle on such a situation. Should people go by the actual results or can that be ignored because the outlook calls for imminent improvement? Generally speaking, forward guidance tends to outweigh quarterly results.However, guidance doesn't always have to be correct. It can also be off, sometimes by a lot. Guidance can also be revised subsequently as more information becomes available. In order to determine what is likely to happen, we need to examine what was said in the earnings call to get a sense of what to make out of all of this.Before examining the earnings call, it's important to take a look at WDC earnings first to get an idea of the challenges facing the company. FQ4 caps what can be described as a challenging year for WDC. FQ4 ended with a net loss of $197M. In comparison, WDC reported a net income of $756M a year ago. Revenue declined by 29% from $5.1B to $3.6B. The table below lists the numbers for FQ4 2019.Net income of $675M in FY2018 turned into a net loss of $754M in FY2019. Revenue declined by almost 20% from $20.6B to $16.6B. So, it's safe to say that there's been quite a turnaround over the last twelve months. WDC is in a hole and it will have to find a way to get out of it. The table below lists the relevant numbers for the whole year.Source: Western DigitalAccording to WDC, the poor results can be blamed on a combination of weak market conditions and geopolitical tensions. However, WDC's CEO expects better times ahead when he states in the earnings call that:A transcript of the FQ4 2019 earnings call can be found here.WDC seems to believe that the flash market is set to recover in the near future. This should bode well if true considering the current and future importance of flash memory for WDC. From the earnings call:Both HDDs and flash are projected to grow.There's also good news from Japan where damage has been contained.In addition, the Huawei situation which resulted in some lost sales does not appear to be as serious as first thought.All in all, a lot of reasons to be optimistic if we go by what was said in the earnings call. WDC is confident that free cash flow will recover as a result of the expected improvement. WDC has had two consecutive quarters of negative free cash flow, but the company now expects that the second half of 2019 will see breakeven in the worst case, if not better.If WDC is to see the kind of improvement it is looking for, then the burden of that happening will likely fall on NAND flash memory since hard drives are doing well as previously mentioned. The NAND market is controlled by a small group of companies. WDC happens to be one of them with a contribution of about 15% to overall supply. The table below lists all the companies and their share in the NAND market.Source: DramexchangeThe NAND market is in a tug-of-war between supply and demand. On the one hand, demand for NAND memory chips is supported by a number of secular trends. For example, the amount of data needed to be stored is growing all the time. Once 5G is rolled out, data growth will only accelerate. NAND flash memory offers a fast and safe way to store data, even if magnetic storage in hard disks is the cheaper option.On the other hand, NAND supply continues to expand rapidly. The introduction of 3D-NAND was in many ways a game changer. Instead of trying to cram as many bits as possible within a fixed area as is the case with planar NAND, 3D-NAND creates more room by stacking multiple layers of bits on top of each other. 3D-NAND is now at 96 layers, but by 2020 that is expected to increase to 128 layers. Even more layers will be added in the future, which means that the amount of data that can be stored using NAND is set to increase tremendously in the coming years.All that growth in both supply and demand creates a challenge. In order for the market to remain balanced, demand has to stay ahead of supply. If it manages to do this, then the NAND market will be fine. But if demand is unable to keep up and is overwhelmed by all the new supply, then the NAND market will be in trouble as prices decline.As of right now, excess supply seems to have the upper hand. According to Dramexchange, contract prices for NAND memory have continued their downward trend in Q3. Something that is not good for WDC. However, the price reductions have decelerated to a certain degree. If this continues, then there's the possibility that the NAND market may have finally turned the corner and could soon be on an upswing. Such an event would obviously be very positive for a company like WDC.Source: Wikimedia CommonsThe earnings call was without a doubt very optimistic about the future outlook for WDC. So optimistic that you have to ask yourself if it wasn't too optimistic and perhaps some skepticism may be warranted. Nevertheless, the positive outlook resulted in attention being drawn away from the actual earnings reported for FQ4 and FY2019.The rosy outlook seems to have overshadowed earnings. But it's important that people not lose track of what's actually going on. WDC suffered a sizable loss for the quarter and for the whole year. Revenue declined substantially. Free cash flow remains in negative territory. The numbers were not good by any stretch of the imagination and there is no concrete proof that is about to change anytime soon.There may be some small signs that the NAND market could possibly be in the early stages of a recovery, but all we really have right now is a positive outlook from an earnings call. There is no real evidence that the difficult market conditions that we have right now cannot last for much longer than some expect. If that happens, then WDC could easily see more bad quarters down the road. The stock would naturally not like that.However, it's possible that WDC management is correct in its outlook. WDC may be on the verge of a turnaround that is sure to help the stock. Ultimately, the decision of what to do with WDC comes down to one's inclination on whether or not WDC management should be given the benefit of the doubt. Can management be trusted to make the right call in the current environment? If the answer is yes, then the bad numbers reported as earnings can be set aside. Otherwise, it's best to stay on the sidelines with regards to WDC."

Demand softened from tariffs, and pricing suffered as well, which brought margins below their 35% historical average.However, WDC has taken measures to address these issues, including closing their HDD plant in Malaysia and lowering CapEx for weaker business segments. The company also believes it is going into 2019 with the strongest product portfolio it has ever had, and this bodes well for the future growth.For the past few years, WDC has been investing in the proper infrastructure and architectural platforms to transform current business lines, making way for the massive amounts of data in the world that will need to transition from hard storage to the cloud.Thankfully for WDC, life as we know it is moving online, and all of this data will need to be stored and transformed with products that the company has a distinct advantage in. The internet of things (IoT), autonomous vehicles, machine learning, surveillance, online banking, and artificial intelligence are just a few of the key themes that the company is now primed and ready to capitalize on.With all of this being said, investors may still feel negative sentiment towards the stock, as latest earnings did disappoint due to the weakening of traditional business lines that seem to be going extinct. However, as alluded to above, WDC has repositioned itself for future growth.Consequently, I am starting a position in WDC here around the low $40s based on its textbook chart, 5% yield, and future growth prospects, all of which are too bullish to pass up. As investors can see below, WDC trades at 19x earnings, which is a bit expensive when considering the fact that growth is slowing in their traditional business lines related to data storage. Source: E*TRADEHowever, some investors may view WDC's rich multiple as a sign of just being a high-quality company, since premium companies usually get assigned premium multiples.After all, their merger with SanDisk made them a clear leader in the storage space. Longer term growth rates should improve as well when the trends listed above gain traction, making WDC's multiple much more tolerable. Investors can also see that WDC is off over 50 points from its highs, indicating that a 100% gain from current levels is possible. The company also sports around a 4.98% dividend, which will pay investors to wait for growth trends to unfold.When looking for trend reversal signals, they don't get much better than a MACD cross combined with a pop over the 50 day moving average, which is what WDC is displaying below. All moving averages are also flattening out with the stock price as it builds a base sideways, which helps stocks break through stubborn resistance levels. Source: E*TRADENot to mention, the move happened on volume that was about 10x the normal average, which is indicative of institutional buying. Needless to say, when smart money starts buying, traders should jump onboard and ride the wave up. These are strong buying indicators, indeed. But the stock has been in free fall, and in order to determine where the floor really is we need to take a step back and examine WDC's chart on a max timeframe. The one-year picture gets rosier when looking at a max timeframe chart, which is showing that $40 appears to be an area of strong support (seen below). Source: E*TRADEWestern Digital's old resistance level of $40 in the late 1990s also adds another element of support, which, combined with recent levels at $40 acting as support, makes the $40 a key area for stock accumulation/distribution. The RSI is also oversold on a max timeframe chart, meaning that the stock has significant room to run before being overbought at 80. In the past, straight moves up from $40 to $100 happened twice. So, with an RSI this low and new growth prospects in the pipeline, $100 could be achieved again realistically. However, I am only looking to take the stock to $60 (around a 50% gain from current levels). The dividend will simply add much needed income to the portfolio and pay me while I wait for the move to occur. Revenues for the second quarter of 2019 were $4.2 billion, with margins only coming in at 31.3%, again related to the weakness stated above. Net income was also negative at $823 million, which is startling at first glance. Flash, which represents half of WDC's revenues, only grew 5% sequentially, and selling price declined 18%, also alluded to in the intro. This development in lower pricing poses some obvious risk to WDC. Measures have been taken to address these issues, however, such as lowering costs by closing facilities in Malaysia, and reducing CapEx in slower growth areas. Therefore, traditional margins of 35% are expected to return, the company believes, especially once new products ramp in 2019 to serve the emerging growth opportunities mentioned above. Besides the risks to WDC from a slowing global economy and its declining flash business, the sustainability of the unusually high dividend is also coming into question by some investors. But WDC still has $4.1 billion in cash, and the company plans to reduce their annual cost-of-goods sold and operating expense levels by a combined amount of $800 million (non-GAAP). So this bolstered cash position should provide plenty of room for WDC to pay out their dividend. In fact, when asked about the sustainability of their dividend on the recent Q2 conference call, WDC management simply said: Western Digital is battling through a weak flash cycle, but is closing their manufacturing plant in Kuala Lumpur and lowering CapEx in their flash business segments. The company also has exciting growth trends that is has painstakingly invested in over the last couple of years which it now can finally seize upon.On top of fundamentals improving, the current dip in share prices back to yearly support of $40 is offering investors the opportunity to catch a double, if only the stock can return to 3/4 of the former highs.If WDC's share price was able to oscillate between $40 and $100, twice, in years past, then I believe the stock can do it again, since now the company is reshaped for new growth trends, and has the strongest portfolio of products they have ever had (according to management).As a result, investors would be wise to make a bet on the future with WDC and go long the storage device maker before the run-up. A safe, 5% dividend should also come in the mail every quarter, and reward investors while they wait for the move up to occur."
4296021,77985,2019-10-10T22:19:33-04:00,"Western Digital is running at a loss, but management is expecting improvement from here on out.NAND prices seem to have stabilized in September thanks to increased demand, which is a positive sign that a turnaround could indeed be around the corner.Tougher sanctions on Huawei and the appearance of a new NAND supplier in China are both negative developments for Western Digital.The good news outweigh the bad news in the short run, but the situation could be different in the more distant future.","Western Digital (WDC) is currently in a slump. The most recent earnings report makes that clear. However, two major developments and one smaller one have since popped up that are relevant to WDC and its attempts to eliminate losses. These new developments have the potential to alter the road ahead for WDC, only in different directions - one to the upside and the other to the downside. Why the first is more likely to impact WDC, at least in the short run, than the second and cause the stock to appreciate will be explained in detail.The company reported a net loss of $197 million for FQ4 2019 and a loss of $754 million for the whole year. Revenue declined by almost 20% in FY2019 because of lower average selling prices for NAND flash memory and reduced sales of HDD products.(Source: Western Digital)Further complicating matters are the restrictions imposed on China’s Huawei due to its presence on the Entity List of the U.S. government. Such a designation limits the ability of American companies to do business with Huawei without express permission from the U.S. government. That includes WDC, which counts Huawei as one of its key customers.Even though demand for storage was weak throughout, the flash-based memory segment was a bigger problem than the HDD segment. The latter fell by 18% and the former by 21%, as can be seen in the table below. The big culprit is falling prices for NAND memory chips. They have been trending lower for quite some time, a major problem for manufacturers of NAND chips such as WDC.(Source: Form 10-K)However, despite weak market conditions, WDC management expects both segments to show improvement in the near future. In the FQ4 2019 earnings call, management stated that:A transcript of the FQ4 2019 earnings call can be found here.The good news is that there have been signs recently that NAND flash memory prices may be on the upswing. For example, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) is by far the biggest supplier of NAND memory chips. Its earnings report from October 8th indicates better-than-expected demand for NAND chips. Excess inventories of NAND seem to be on the decline - a positive sign that NAND prices could indeed be on the rise.According to other industry sources, NAND flash contract prices have stopped falling in the third quarter. In the month of September, NAND prices stayed flat at an average of $4 in comparison to the month before. This based on recent numbers from DRAMeXchange. They could potentially rise as much as 10% in the fourth quarter of 2019.The driving factors behind the recovery in prices are reduced production of NAND memory chips by suppliers and end-market demand picking up due to seasonality. If Q4 prices do increase, then that would go a long way toward addressing one of the main reasons for the poor performance by WDC in recent quarters. Assuming, of course, that higher prices are sustained and not just a flash in the pan.According to the company’s Form 10-K, Huawei accounted for about 10% of net accounts receivable as of June 2019. So, it is a significant customer as far as WDC is concerned. Unfortunately for WDC, it looks like the situation with Huawei will not be returning to normal anytime soon.The U.S. administration had previously allowed a temporary waiver that granted American companies the ability to continue to do business with Huawei. The first waiver was passed in May earlier this year, and the 90-day waiver is now set to expire on November 19 after it was renewed once. But recent news reports indicate that the U.S. government is leaning towards putting more pressure on Huawei. That’s not good news for WDC.As mentioned previously, reduced supplies of NAND memory chips have helped stabilize prices in recent months. Unfortunately for the current crop of NAND suppliers, WDC included, a new player has entered the market by starting production of flash memory in China. On September 2nd, Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. (“YMTC”), a subsidiary of Tsinghua Unigroup, announced that it has started volume production of 64-layer 256Gb TLC 3D-NAND flash memory in Wuhan, China.Furthermore, YMTC expects to produce 128-layer QLC NAND chips in 2020, which, if achieved, would pretty much close the gap with other NAND suppliers in terms of process technology. The company claims that its NAND chips, made with the Xtacking architecture, offer a number of advantages compared to its peers. They include higher performance with faster read/write speeds, higher storage density and a shorter product manufacturing period.YMTC is targeting monthly output to be somewhere between 100,000 and 150,000 12-inch wafers in 2020. Capacity will be added in stages, but the fab in Wuhan is supposed to have a monthly production capacity of 300,000 12-inch wafers when fully completed. In comparison, the worldwide production capacity of all NAND manufacturers stands at 1,500,000 wafers per month at the moment.(Source: DRAMeXchange)YMTC will join a group of six companies that currently supply almost all NAND memory, as can be seen in the table above. In addition, Tsinghua Unigroup is building additional fabs in the Chinese cities of Nanjing and Chengdu. Both of them will produce NAND memory chips and are intended to be comparable in size to the one in Wuhan. That implies a monthly production capacity of 300,000 wafers.(Source: Wikimedia Commons)WDC currently controls about 15% of the NAND memory market, but the entry of one or more suppliers will only increase already stiff competition. Such cut-throat competition may be good news for the consumer looking to snap up cheap SSDs, but it’s not so great for a company like WDC. The company is running at a loss, after all, which means that it could use less and not more competition. Excessive competition will hurt memory prices, making it more difficult for WDC to return to profitability.The memory industry is already dealing with excess inventory, and NAND manufacturers have been reducing output in an effort to stabilize the market. But the addition of a new supplier will undo some of that effort. Depending on how much production capacity Chinese suppliers are able to bring on-line in the next couple of years, new supplies of NAND memory from China could become a major headache for WDC.However, all this will not happen overnight. It will take some time for Chinese supplies to reach critical levels before they will start to have an impact on the memory market. In the short run, concern about Chinese NAND suppliers should take a backseat to the more imminent prospect of higher prices for NAND memory due to increased demand.The latter is much more likely to have an immediate impact on earnings than the former, at least for the next two or three quarters. There are clear signs that the memory market is about to revive and NAND prices are about to go up this quarter. Such a development means much more for WDC than new production from China that is still at least several quarters away from coming to fruition.Bottom line, recent developments are mostly in favor of WDC, as suggested in this article's introduction. That bodes well for the company’s future prospects and its ability to get out of the red, at least in the short run. If this turns out to be correct, then WDC stock could appreciate based on reduced or even total elimination of current losses - a much-needed turn of the tide. Especially with the company at a loss, a situation no company wants to be in. But longer term, WDC may have to deal with some serious issues that could force the company back into the red."
4258054,103213,2019-04-30T13:37:09-04:00,"Western Digital generates large amounts of Cash and the dividend is safe.The company is undervalued despite having great financial strength & earnings quality.Unfortunately, management isn't committed to growing the dividend, and the yield isn't sufficient for a pure income play.","Written by Robert KovacsNote: My analysis incorporates my framework which I call ""MAD Investing"" or Machine Assisted Dividend Investing. Every day, I calculate approximately 60,000 ratios for all U.S. stocks. I sort all stocks into percentiles for each ratio, from strongest to weakest. This information is used to derive a ""stock strength score"" and a ""dividend strength score,"" which serve as indicators of a stock's potential for capital appreciation and potential as an income producing investment, respectively. To learn more about how these scores are calculated, please refer to this post. All financial data on mad-dividends.com is sourced straight from the S.E.C., whereas price data comes from IEX.Western Digital Corporation (WDC) has a dividend yield of 3.93% & trades around $50.92. Based on my M.A.D Assessment WDC has a Dividend Strength score of 48 and a Stock Strength score of 98.I believe that dividend investors should avoid Western Digital Corporation at current prices. There will likely be no dividend growth soon, and the yield just isn't good enough for a pure income play.Source: mad-dividends.comWestern Digital Corporation is a developer, manufacturer and provider of data storage devices and solutions that address the needs of the information technology industry and the infrastructure that enables the proliferation of data in virtually every industry. The company's portfolio of offerings addresses three categories:The analysis presented in this article is divided into two sections - dividend strength and stock strength.For me dividend strength and stock strength are two distinct phenomena. Companies with a high dividend strength score are ones which are interesting to dividend investors as they have a strong dividend supported by strong underlying fundamentals and are more likely to continue paying and growing their dividends. Companies which have a high stock strength score are good picks for capital gains investors. It follows that the best stocks for dividend investors are usually those which rank well for both categories.When looking at the dividend strength of a company, I am looking for a combination of good yield and dividend growth as well as dividend safety.Thus it makes sense that my assessment of dividend strength takes into account both dividend safety and dividend potential.To assess dividend safety I will look at payout ratios and coverage ratios. Dividend potential will be assessed by focusing on the company's dividend yield, historical dividend growth as well as evolution of top and bottom line results throughout the past years.Western Digital Corporation pays out 72% of earnings as dividends. This is better than 23% of dividend stocks.I then look at cashflow payout ratio; which is dividends in relation to operating cashflow. By looking at cashflow payout as well as earnings payout, I get a better grip of the company's ability to pay its dividend. WDC pays 19% of its operating cashflow as a dividend, which is better than 64% of dividend stocks.Finally, I look at the company's free cash flow payout. This adjusts operating cashflow for capital expenditures & paints the clearest picture of whether or not the company can afford its dividend. 35% of Western Digital Corporation's free cashflow are paid out as dividends, putting it ahead of 58% of dividend stocks.Based on these numbers, I believe Western Digital Corporation's pay-out ratio to be satisfying. Looking beyond the earnings payout, we realize that WDC generates tons of cashflow, enough to cover its dividend multiples times. This is very satisfying.Source: mad-dividends.comWe want to make sure the company makes sufficient income to cover both its interest and debt service multiple times.WDC has an interest coverage ratio of 4x which is better than 16% of stocks. This level of coverage is ok.Given the coverage and payout ratios, it would seem like WDC's dividend is safe. The cash covers it multiple times, I wouldn't worry about a dividend cut.Next, we look at the stock's potential to pay us a decent dividend which grows at a satisfying rate.Source: mad-dividends.comWestern Digital Corporation has a dividend yield of 3.93% which is better than 79% of dividend stocks.The dividend grew 0% during the last 12 months which is disappointing. The company hasn't grown its dividend since 2015, despite generating enough cashflow to do so.Source: mad-dividends.comDuring the last 3 years, the company's revenues have grown at a 13% CAGR, while net income has decreased at a -10% CAGR. For a company to continue paying a growing dividend in the foreseeable future, it needs to keep growing both the top and bottom lines.While fiscal years 2016 and 2017 (WDC's fiscal year ends in June) produced subpar earnings, 2018 would have been a blow-out year if it weren't for the one time repatriation tax, the effects of which are still present in the last quarter of 2018.Moving forward, I expect earnings to go back to previous levels, despite the firm operating at lower margins.Source: mad-dividends.comIf the company keeps growing revenue and net income at the current rate, WDC's dividend has sub-par potential. While in theory all the elements are there for the company to increase its dividend, management has chosen not to.WDC has a dividend strength score of 48/100.As a dividend growth investor, the lack of dividend growth is worrying. While management repeatedly states it is committed to the dividend, there seems to be no intention of growing it regularly.This is disappointing, given that the company generates enough cash to afford multiple dividend increases in upcoming years.Focusing only on dividends is a mistake which many dividend investors have made in the past. While companies which pay stable and growing dividends usually fare quite well, one would be foolish to not look closely at the fundamentals.Four main factors dictate stock performance: value, momentum, financial strength & earnings quality.I look at these factors separately and jointly to assess the quality of the company which I'm considering investing in.This won't come as a surprise to most, undervalued stocks outperform in the long run. Value can be quantitatively assessed by looking at ratio such as P/E, P/S, P/CFO & Shareholder Yield. Depending on the stock's ratios, I assign it a value score out of 100.WDC's value ratios are:According to these values, WDC is more undervalued than 95% of stocks, which is extremely satisfying as it implies the stock is out of favor and likely trading below its fair value.Value Score: 95/100Furthermore, I like to draw PE Lines over the stock chart, like Peter Lynch used to do back in his day. Doing so gives investors an idea of the stock's valuation range as a multiple of earnings.Source: mad-dividends.comAs you can see, WDC is currently trading below its historical average PE. This implies that the market is currently valuing it below its 5 year average trend. It is harder to get any insightful data from these charts when earnings have been as volatile as WDC's.Overall, WDC would seem undervalued.The trend is your friend. Many investors mistakenly believe that buying trending stocks is reserved to growth investors.Nothing could be more wrong. Since stocks which have been going down will likely continue to go down, and those which are going up are more likely to continue to increase, one could argue that purchasing on the way down generally isn't the best strategy.Western Digital Corporation trades at $50.92 and is up 17.98% these last 3 months, 15.23% these last 6 months & down 42.08% these last 12 months.Source: mad-dividends.comThis gives it better momentum than 55% of stocks, which is not great. The stock's short term momentum is good, having staged a recovery, but it is still down more than 40% for the last 12 months. This is a worse 12 month performance than 90% of stocks out there.The momentum scares me. I'd need to see the stock make a prolonged recovery over the next two quarters to be comfortable considering the investment.Momentum score: 55/100Company's which are financially sound don't need to increase their leverage dramatically; they also produce high amounts of cashflow in relation to their liabilities.They also tend to outperform those which are not financially sound. Furthermore, rapid increase in leverage might indicate problems down the line, especially for dividend investors.WDC has a Debt/Equity ratio of 1.6, which is better than 46% of stocks. The company's liabilities have decreased by -8% over the course of the last 12 months. The company's operating cashflow can cover 18.0% of liabilities.This makes WDC more financially sound than 81% of U.S. listed stocks.Financial Strength Score: 81/100The low levels of leverage & reduction in liabilities is appreciated, and WDC's financial strength cannot be bashed.Companies which have high quality earnings will have low levels of accruals, will depreciate assets quickly and will have high quality assets which produce lots of revenue.WDC's Total Accruals to Assets ratio of -12.9% is better than 63% of companies.It depreciates 211.1% of its capital expenditure each year, which is better than 75% of stocks. Finally, the company's asset turnover of 0.7x is higher than 57% of stocks. This makes WDC's earnings quality better than 82% of stocks.Earnings Quality Score: 82/100When combining the different factors of the stocks profile, we get a stock strength score of 98/100 which is fantastic.All the numbers seem good for stock strength, and if the company keeps trading at similar prices for the upcoming quarter, it will be in an ideal position for rapid price appreciation.With a dividend strength score of 48 & a stock strength of 98, Western Digital Corporation is a sub-par choice for dividend investors.Those looking for dividend growth won't find it, while those relying on income will be better served focusing on stocks with higher yields.Despite an attractive profile for capital gains investors -as shown by the superior stock strength - & despite generating large amounts of cash, the company simply isn't committed to growing their dividend.For a dividend investor like me, that's a definite no.

4250915,102356,2019-03-25T17:18:54-04:00,Relative value analysis shows a deep discount to the semiconductor sector.Discounted cash flow points to a potential of circa 40%.Deep value investment in the technology sector.Financialy safe and sound.Growth sector that should support the long-term profitability advancement.,"Similarly to other Semiconductor companies, during the past twelve months, Western Digital (WDC) had a roller-coaster ride. During this period it went from a market darling to an ugly duckling, and at one point, the drop from the top of the year was almost 70%.WDC is currently out of favor stock that is shunned by both Wall Street and Main Street and is consequently cheaply priced, but this is exactly why it is a great candidate for a deep value investing. As hype for the semiconductor companies swung from euphoria to depression, so did the Western Digital equity price. But as WDC should never have been a market darling, it should never have been an ugly duckling either. This analysis shows that the truth is somewhere in between and that current price offers a very good entry point with a high reward/risk ratio.Source: stockcharts.comMemory market has experienced a significant downtrend in prices, but this is neither the first nor the last time we see such price volatility. Nevertheless, there are lots of signs that this market imbalance between supply and demand and subsequent price decline should not be permanent, and that the semiconductor companies should in the coming years grow its revenues and profits above the current levels.From 2010 until the last financial report, WDC has achieved a high growth of revenues, operating earnings, and free cash flow. During this period, its revenues have increased by 160%, operating earnings (EBIT) by 346%, and free cash flow to the firm (FCFF) by 172%.After a period of growth, for lots of market participants, it is unclear if the current down cycle is a sign that the long term upward trend is over. If this is true, the present deep value level could be justified. However, there are a lot of clues that the current situation is just a short-lived setback and that the long-term upward trend will be back on track.At this point, numerous technological forces are driving the semiconductor market, but for WDC most important ones are the upcoming launch of 5G communication networks, rapid advancement of autonomous driving, growth in computing complexity, strong growth of data centers, cloud computing applications, increasing memory capabilities of smartphones, and Internet-connected products. All these technological trends are driving unabated growth in the volume of digital content to be stored, and storage solutions that hold large amounts of data are a key enabler of the trends seen in the evolution of a data-driven economy.During the last year, the total worth of the worldwide memory market was $166 billion. As the memory category has experienced a growth of 27.2%, it was the largest and the best performing semiconductor segment. It is forecasted that this trend will continue in the coming years, and it is anticipated that by 2024, the memory market will be worth $730 billion. As the compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) is expected to be around 28%, this should support WDC in growing its revenues and profits.Western Digital is comprised of three different business units that target different end market segments. The Client Devices segment is the largest one, and during the first two quarters of fiscal 2019, it represented a significant 53% of the total revenues. This segment consists of hard disk drives (HDDs) and solids state drives (SSDs) for computing devices, flash-based embedded storage products, and flash-based memory wafers. The second largest is the Data Center Devices Solutions that during the same period accounted for 27% of the revenues. This segment includes high-capacity enterprise HDDs and high-performance enterprise SSDs, data center software, and system solutions. The third and the smallest one is the Client Solutions sector which represented 20% of revenues.During the last two quarters, all three segments have experienced a decrease in revenues. But the hardest hit was the smallest segment, which is experiencing the strongest competition and has seen a decrease in its revenues by 21%. This segment consists of external storage products and removable flash-based products which include cards, universal serial bus (“USB”) flash drives, and wireless drives. The only positive thing is that this segment does not have a crucial influence as WDC is much more reliant on the other two segments.Compared by the form, during the last six months, both HDD and SSD experienced lower sales, but SDD products experienced a much smaller decline than the HDD products. The result of this trend is that the SSD products have for the first time in WDC's history represent more than half (51%) of the total revenues. In the coming quarters, we can expect a continuation of this trend as the data technology industry is undergoing substantial change. This market transformation is driving increased adoption of SSDs and NAND flash in traditional HDD applications.In the next few quarters, we should see a positive development for the supply and demand balance, as the main competitors such as Micron, SK Hynix, and Samsung are signaling a reduction in capital expenditures. This should result in the supply growing at no more than 15%, while the demand is expected to grow in the upper twenties. Consequently, this should stabilize business in the next quarters, and assure the growth of the revenues and profits in the coming years.When we compare WDC to the components of the PHLX Semiconductor index, we can see that its valuation rations are at the bottom of the sector. For example, the EV/EBIT ratio for WDC is 7.39, which is 56% below the median of the PHLX index that is 16.75. The only company that is by this metric cheaper than WDC is Micron Technology. Similarly, EV/EBITDA for WDC is 5.57, which is 59% cheaper than the median PHLX value. The P/B ratio points in the same direction, and is 70% below the sector median. The same thing is for P/S as well, as this ratio is currently at 0.73 and is 71% below the median.According to the relative value analysis, WDC trades at the bottom of the sector, with only Micron having lower EV/EBIT and EV/EBITDA valuations.All balance sheet and profit and loss data are based on the available trailing twelve months financial reports, and market prices are from 03/22/2019. Companies are arranged from the lowest to the highest EV/EBIT ratio.*WDC is not included in median and average calculations. Source: www.morningstar.comDiscounted Cash Flow Analysis (DCF)Similarly to the relative value analysis, DCF shows that WDC is trading at a deep discount. As of 03/22/2019, the calculated cost of equity for WDC is 10,53%, and the weighted average cost of capital is 7.97%. As a proxy for the pre-tax cost of debt, I took the last Senior Notes 2026 offering that bears an interest rate of 4,75%.Source for ERP: Damodaran ONLINEThe calculation is based on the assumption that in the second half of the fiscal 2019 revenues will have a steeper decline than during the first half of the year, bringing the total YoY decline to 12%. For fiscal 2020 I conservatively forecasted flat revenues, and from 2021 perpetual growth rate is forecasted at 3%. Taking into account the previous supply & demand forecast, this calculation is significantly on the lower end of the possible outcomes.EBITDA margin should during the next five years gradually return to 18.80%, which is an average for the last five years. Due to the technological changes, I have forecasted high CAPEX needs (15% per year) that will be significantly above the rates we have seen during the last few years.Even though this DCF analysis was calculated with an assumption of the lackluster sales growth coupled with the higher CAPEX needs, the price target is significantly above the current levels and stands at $48.39, which is the growth potential of more than 40%.Despite being a part of a growth industry, with current valuation ratios, Western Digital trades as a deep value investment. Both the relative value and DCF analyses show that at current price levels too much pessimism is counted in and that during the coming months we could see WDC's stock price at much higher levels.Even though lots of negative influences are factored in the current price, there are still some that could affect the price in the coming quarters. The most notable one is the possibility the memory prices will not stabilize and that we will experience a continuation of the downward trend. The second risk is that we could see a further escalation of tensions between the US and China, which would disrupt WDC's exports to China. The third risk is a continuation of the strengthening of USD, which could decrease revenues outside the US market.After the acquisition of SanDisk, short term debt was $3.3B, and net debt has spiked to $8.6B. During the past few years, WDC has almost eliminated its short term debt and has decreased its net debt position to $6.6B. Currently, the short term debt is only $244 million, and the cash position is above $4B. In other words, WDC is more than adequately capitalized, especially if we know that it has more than $10B of shareholders' capital.The semiconductor memory segment is still in a significant down cycle. But due to the expected change in the supply and demand forces, and the rapid technological development of the different end markets, this situation should change, and the long-term growth of the whole memory market should stay intact.On the relative and absolute basis, WDC trades as a deeply discounted company. At the current valuation, the market expects too pessimistic development of the memory market, and prices Western Digital as one of the cheapest US equities. Such low valuation coupled with the growth prospects should provide a very good entry point with a high reward/risk ratio."

Quantitative analysis of historical data shows that the combination of dividends, buybacks, and low valuation could lead to the annualized returns of up to 17%.Source: S&P 500 - NYU SternThe equity market has gone through a structural change because companies currently pay out a lower percentage of their earnings in cash dividends than they have historically. During the end of the 1960s, the 10-year moving average dividend payout ratio stood at approximately 55%. However, the payout ratio declined significantly, and the 10-year moving average in 2018 fell to 35%.Due to this trend, using just the dividend yield and dividend payout ratio could be misleading. Additionally, research has shown that the shareholder yield compared to dividend yield provides much better insight into the expected future returns.During the last month, as Trump's stance on the U.S.-China trade war eased toward a deal, the whole semiconductor sector followed with the upward price movement. On top of this, Goldman Sachs upgraded Micron, which is one of WDC's fiercest competitors. Target or Micron was set at $56, which at the current price offers roughly 17% upside. The second semiconductor upgrade from Goldman came for Lam Research, which supplies wafer fabrication equipment and services to the semiconductor industry.Both upgrades were justified as an improvement of memory-chip trends coupled with the early signs of memory stabilization. Goldman analyst wrote that semiconductor inventory is being depleted faster than previously expected, and as the rate of production of new memory decelerates, they forecast that in 2020 production will ultimately fall below the long-term demand growth.With the changed outlook, Goldman came to the same conclusion which I wrote four months ago in my ""Western Digital: Deep Value Trap Or Gem?"" article. In that article, my ending thoughts were:It is expected that by 2024, the semiconductor memory market will experience double-digit annual growth. This growth is fueled by numerous technological advancements, such as autonomous driving, 5G communication networks, growth of data centers and cloud computing, increasing memory capabilities of smartphones, and Internet-connected products. All these trends fuel a sustained increase in digital content that needs to be stored, which makes memory chips the prime facilitator in the expansion of the data economy.Following all the end market trends, in my opinion, there is a high probability that the current price slump is just a temporary setback, and that the market recovery experienced after 2015 will repeat.Micron's (MU) stock completed a similar double bottom pattern as WDC did, and broke the critical resistance roughly two weeks ago. Following the breakout, Micron maintained its upward trend, which statistically is highly likely to continue.Currently, WDC's price is in a similar position in which MU was two weeks ago. If we now combine low valuations with the upbeat mood on Wall Street, this could be a catalyst that WDC's shareholders were waiting for.Source: stockcharts.comWestern Digital's Fourth-quarter results for the fiscal year 2019 are scheduled for publication on July 31. The release could induce short term volatility. However, the underlying buy thesis should not change, and WDC should remain one of the cheapest large-cap equities.I have updated a relative value analysis of the PHLX Semiconductor index, which I published four months ago. Since then, valuations have increased, but on relative value, Micron Technology and Western Digital remained the two cheapest stocks.Compared to the PHLX Semiconductor index, WDC's EV/EBITDA, price to book, and price to sales are respectively 60%, 70%, and 80% below the index median.By these metrics, the only cheaper company is Micron, which has EV/EBITDA 80%, and price to book 73% below the PHLX median. However, in terms of price to sales ratio, Micron has a higher valuation than Western Digital.However, MU currently does not offer a dividend, so distributions to shareholders comprise only share buybacks, which are lower than WDC's shareholder yield. Due to this, MU is not included in my Model portfolio. Nonetheless, if the dividend policy changes and discount stays around current levels, it will be included.*WDC is not included in median and average calculations. Source: AAIIThe current down cycle has significantly decreased operating and free cash flow (FCF). However, although WDC had record-high capital expenditures, with its trailing twelve months FCF, it has financed 86% of dividends and share repurchases.FCF for the last four quarters was the lowest since 2014, but it is reasonable to assume that in the next year improvements in the business conditions will follow. Due to this improvement, FCF should be adequate to maintain or even high enough to increase the total cash return to shareholders (through higher dividends or buybacks).Source: MorningstarWhen we check WDC's balance sheet, we can see that the short-term debt is only $276 million. This number is really low and does not pose any risk to operations or cash returns to shareholders. The total net debt is $6.9 billion, and as the trailing twelve months EBITDA is $3.327 billion, the net/debt ratio is relatively low and amounts to 2.07.Companies from the Model portfolio have above-average dividend yields coupled with above-average buyback yields, which leads to exceptional cash returns at below-average valuations. If an investor would follow this approach month after month, and year after year, the underlying mass biases and systematic market mispricings exploited in this time tested strategy should ensure long-term outperformance.In this part, I will present the current shareholder yield portfolio for which I select all U.S. companies with a market cap above $4 billion. After controlling for size, I remove all stocks with negative EBITDA. ADR securities, financials, and all other companies for which calculation of EV/EBITDA is not possible will be excluded from this portfolio.Following these steps, around 680 companies remain. After this, I arrange stocks from the highest to the lowest shareholder yield and take the top quartile (approximately 170 stocks with the highest shareholder yield). These 170 stocks with the highest yield I arrange from the highest to the lowest EV/EBITDA and select the top 50 cheapest stocks.These top 50 stocks, which present the best combination of the highest cash distributions coupled with the lowest valuations I call ""Enhanced Shareholder Yield Model Portfolio.""Weekly, I will update and publish the 50 stock portfolio with detailed characteristics, and present the top buy opportunities for new money, which I will discuss in greater detail.Below are the current 50 mid-cap and large-cap companies with the highest shareholder yield and the lowest valuation. Excel version with additional ratios is on the link below.Enhanced_Shareholder_Yield_Model_Portfolio_07.26.2019.xlsSource: American Association of Individual Investors; Proprietary researchAssuming equal weightings (2% per position), current Enhanced Shareholder Yield Model Portfolio offers an above-average dividend of 2.78% combined with a superior net buyback yield of 5.46%. The total cash return to the owner of this portfolio during the last 12 months was exceptional 8.23%. At the same time, components of the Model portfolio trade at deep value levels. Currently, the median EV/EBITDA for these 50 stocks is 6.35, and the median price to earnings ratio is just 11.30.The highest sector allocation under the GICS classification is capped at 25%. If one sector represents more than 25% of my portfolio, I would remove the least appealing stock from the overrepresented sector, and include the next best investment from any other sector.My portfolio is well-diversified and consists of 50 different stocks, with each position capped at 2% for the initial buy. As I have a long investment horizon with no foreseeable cash needs, my willingness and ability to tolerate risk are above average. Because of this, the largest part of my financial assets is allocated in equity investments. In the case of an unforeseeable need, a smaller portion of my total wealth is in a cash account.If you will use this strategy, it is essential to adjust percentage allocation to equities, and the number of equity securities in your portfolio according to your willingness and ability to tolerate risk.As I have a steady income and monthly ability to invest, every month, I buy four to five new investments. These stock picks are from the Enhanced Shareholder Yield Model Portfolio, and consist of the cheapest companies included on the list. If I already own the best investment on the list, I move down the line and buy the second best that I do not own.After one year passes, if a company is still on the list of the top 50 investments, then it stays in my portfolio. If it is not on the list (either for the price increase or for fundamentals deterioration), subsequently this security is sold, and I buy the next top investment which I do not own.Monthly purchases are one possibility for the utilization of this strategy. The other option would be to invest immediately in the 50 top investments included in the Enhanced Shareholder Yield Model Portfolio and rebalance after a year according to the updated portfolio list.Using this strategy, I continuously buy mid-cap and large-cap U.S. equities, which have the highest cash distributions and at the same time sell at the cheapest valuations. I will update the list every week, and discuss new entrants to the Model portfolio.

4238130,103012,2019-02-05T09:21:36-05:00,"Western Digital is navigating through the trough of the cycle successfully as it remains free cash flow generative.2019 promises improving margins and average selling prices for HDDs and SSDs.However, Micron, a related player in the data management sector, is a better bet.","Western Digital (WDC) makes hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid-state drives (SSDs) or flash-based memory. The latter product is manufactured under a joint venture with Toshiba Memory Corp (TMC).Operating since 1970, the company has navigated successfully through the cyclicality of the industry. Currently, WDC is experiencing the down cycle of the industry, and arguably the bottom is about to form. In just a few quarters, the whole sector looks likely to revert to growth. Unsurprisingly, since the start of the decline, WDC remained highly profitable and committed to returns cash to its shareholders through its 5% dividend yield and buyback. Nevertheless, we are witnessing an ever more competitive market, and although we feel that WDC is a good bet in the industry, its economics are not as strong, and its margins will not expand as fast as others. We feel Micron (MU) is a safer bet.Source: WDC, 10-K, 2018, SegmentsBefore comparing with Micron, let’s have a look at what WDC has gone through and what have they done to deserve a substantial share price performance discrepancy to Microns.Source: Yahoo Finance, Jan 2019 price chartThe peaks and troughs of the semiconductor cycle are clear from looking at the chart above. The cycle is identical at the other HDDs producers, Seagate (STX), Samsung (OTC:SSDIY), and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY). And similarly, at the SSDs players: SK Hynix( OTC:HXSCF) ( OTC:HXSCL), Micron and Intel (INTC).Although Micron is not the perfect like-to-like comparison to WDC as half of WDC’s revenue comes from HDDs, whereas Micron focuses on SSD solutions that combine DRAM and NAND. Nevertheless, they both compete to design and manufacture solutions for the future of data management. Both also supplies storage and memory solutions to data centers, PCs, and embedded business units. Finally, we feel investors in WDC should look into MU as an alternative investment in the sector.Now, despite the recent resurgent of share prices and sentiment across the semiconductor industry, hard drives and memory prices are still expected to be soft. Recent Q2’19 results showed that revenue in each of their end markets declined on a year-over-year basis due to a combination of lower demand and aggressive flash pricing conditions despite healthy growth in flash bits sold. The softness is expected to continue in Q3. The reasons are because of reduced demand for mobile handsets and continued slowdown investments by hyperscale customer’s inventory adjustments at certain customers and geopolitical volatility.WDC’s peers such as NVIDIA (NVDA), Intel and MU, have reported similar softness in their products average selling price. However, the market appears to be more rational as most producers cut CAPEX (MU -17%, SK Hynix -17% for DRAM and -66% for NAND, Samsung -60% in DRAM but +60% in NAND) and supply to support prices. In WDC’s case, they have accelerated the closing down of factories in Malaysia and lowered CAPEX.Although the industry is at the bottom, Q2 results were not a disaster. WDC achieved $24M of FCF. In Q3, WDC is expected to remain free cash flow neutral and decline modestly in the cash balance. Additionally, WDC’s planned annual cost saving of $800M will add substantially to the bottom line.Lastly, WDC’s balance sheet remains strong, against a $4.6B cash and normalized annual FCF of $2.5B, the long-term debt figure of $10B isn’t a concern. As this is at the trough of the cycle, the balance sheet and FCF neutral situation are extremely positive.Source: WDC 10-K, 2018, Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsWDC has managed to remain FCF neutral at the trough. Things could be rosy in 2019 as ASP improves and $800M cost saving kicks in. We think that WDC has meaningful downside protection. However, WDC will not benefit in the upcycle as much as Micron. Here’s why.Firstly, in the next several years, WDC expects to develop and commercialize additional generations of 3D NAND technologies. Meanwhile, MU will be launching 3D Xpoint solutions by the end of 2019, designed to be faster than NAND and less expensive than DRAM. MU would become the only full-stack provider of storage and memory in the industry. While 3D NAND and 3D Xpoint are unrelated, they will be the most innovative step forward for WDC and MU, respectively. The difference is MU is looking to push their product to market sooner.Secondly, as things will improve in H2, WDC’s margins will also grow with the $800M annual cost saving. However, WDC storage segment isn’t likely to bring as high margin business as MU’s memory segment.Currently, WDC is gunning for gross margin and net margin at around 40% and 20% respectively. The levels are higher than MU’s historical value. Stepping back 15 years leading up to 2015, MU’s DRAM average gross margin was at 20%. However, in 2017, it rose to 56%, and then up again to 70% in 2018. The margin expansion at MU was incredibly impressive. MU’s CEO, Sanjay explained that although the company is experiencing a period of margin contraction, the figure for 2019 will be significantly higher than previous cycles at 20%.In addition, Micron has also been focusing on higher value product mix such as SSD. Four years ago, Micron went from selling 80% of NAND as components to now at just 40%. Thus, at the moment 60% of NAND products are higher margin. The goal in 2021 is to revert the 80% from low-value to high-value solutions.Meanwhile, in WDC’s case, 2019 promises greater participation in higher value markets. However, it’s hard to see that the level of margin expansion in WDC’s HDDs and SSD’s will be as high as MU’s DRAM and NAND solutions. In the words of the CEO.Moreover, WDC’s margins are restricted due to inflexibility and high reliance on Toshiba Memory Corp, who supplies WDC’s flash memories through their Flash Joint-Ventures.Frankly, WDC products are more commodity-like compared to MU’s. Sharing the future growth in Automotive, Connected Homes and AI, yet, WDC is not going to capture as much profit as MU. Moreover, we find WDC’s communication with investors less informative than MUs’, specific numbers were not disclosed. It’s hard to pin down an estimate of how much WDC will participate in higher margin products and markets.Finally, despite the limitations above, WDC’s valuation is also less attractive than MU’s. WDC is currently trading at 4.7x Operating Cash Flow (OCF) and 17x PE, while MU is trading at 2.6x and 3.3x respectively.WDC is navigating through the trough of its cycle successfully. The management is focused on restoring the supply and demand balance to support prices. WDC is also likely to improve its margins in 2019 while participating in growth areas in automotive, connected home and surveillance categories. WDC represents a meaningful margin of safety thanks to its solid performance at the trough, healthy balance sheet, active buyback, and 5% dividend. However, we feel Micron has better economics and more dexterous in expanding margins. Finally, MU is also trading more cheaply than WDC. Thus, we think Micron has more upside at current prices. We encourage investors to look at MU as a related sector investment.Authors’ note: If you enjoyed this article and wish to receive updates on our latest research, click ""Follow"" next to our name at the top of this article.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

We have seen Western, Seagate and Toshiba having substantial moat in the past 15-20 years in non-volatile memory, but does it give these firms strong potential as markets brace for SSD replacing HDD? I doubt it. There are too many manufacturers already rocking the SSD market.Although WDC management does not directly agree that NAND ASP declines could pressure it to cut HDD pricing to slow down the substitution of SSDs versus HDD, that is a valid possibility. WDC’s top lines have been good on average for a long period of time, but future viability is distorted by a myriad of factors. Sure, the trade war has made it worse, but investors may also have been pricing decline in HDD’s average selling prices and also the potential of gradually losing market share as competitors disrupt the non-volatile memory markets. Even based on the current standing of the SSD market, I don’t see any reason for WDC having an edge.Source: Statista“Our immediate reduction in wafer starts and delayed deployment of capital equipment is a reflection of the adjustment to bit supply growth needed to improve the supply-demand dynamic by midyear 2019.

Western currently expects revenue in the range of $4.2 billion to $4.4 billion for the second quarter, the midpoint of which is 10%+ lower than its average sales for last ten quarters. Gross margin is expected to be in a range of 32% to 33%, which is on par with its usual performance. The expectations overall implies a non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.45 to $1.65 for its Q2, which is also disappointing.Yes, the dividends are good, so is the payout, valuation is “apparently” attractive and long standing in the market does it some strength. But the future doesn’t look so clear for Western. Lower sales expectations could go on for quarters if geopolitical tension and inventory factors doesn’t resolve, FCF will be under pressure and larger payouts might be required to support its attractive yield levels. From quantitative orientation, sure the price is cheap, but if the cheapness is somewhat justified then what’s the motivation to buy? Seagate’s situation is far worse, but I’ll keep that for another discussion.Source: MorningstarSource: Seeking AlphaThe table above does show that Western went through a good homerun, and it looks appealing from a valuation perspective. But the firm might need higher payouts to support its yield amidst declining FCF, investors might jeopardize income with negative price returns. I wouldn’t recommend buying Western now."
4235719,103480,2019-01-25T16:35:31-05:00,"Shares of Western Digital jumped despite reporting weaker-than-expected Q2 results, after initially falling.Weakness in NAND pricing and a decline in HDD volumes sent revenues into a double-digit decline.On a GAAP basis, Western Digital’s net income also swung to a loss.Given that the stock remains down more than 50% from peak values, however, it’s worth waiting out the down cycle.","Earnings is never an easy time for holders of Western Digital's (WDC) stock - but this time around, Western Digital seemed to pull through. After initially dropping as much as 5% in response to lower-than-expected revenues and negative GAAP EPS, Western Digital's shares popped nearly 10% in after-hours trading, following in the footsteps of other semiconductor stocks like Xilinx (XLNX) that jumped this earnings season.Data by YChartsIn the semi space, the key theme seems to be that no bad news is good news. Such was the case with Western Digital. Investors already knew what to expect: the entire memory sector had already warned on softening prices and a pullback in end-customer demand for several quarters. Though Western Digital’s quarterly print wasn’t exactly pretty, it was far better than feared.As I’ve written in a previous article, I’m stubbornly holding on to my Western Digital shares. The value element in this stock is too appealing to ignore: at a share price that’s still down more than 50% from a peak value of over $100 last year, Western Digital trades at ~6x this year’s EPS estimate of $6.71 (per Yahoo! Finance). It’s also key to keep in mind that Western Digital’s authorized $5 billion buyback covers a whopping ~40% of the company’s current market cap. Even after the January rebound, it's fairly difficult to find any stock in the market trading at such a compelling value.Western Digital’s outlook for the coming year certainly isn’t pretty - which is the reason why shares have pulled back so drastically. Alongside this quarter’s earnings, the company has issued the following guidance update:Figure 1. Western Digital guidanceSource: Western Digital earnings materialsThe key point here: even the top end of Western Digital’s revenue range ($3.8 billion) falls below the Wall Street average estimate of $3.9 billion, while pro forma gross margins are expected to continue free-falling. Certainly this isn’t good news - but in my view, Western Digital’s lowball valuation makes this down cycle worth waiting out. A poor year in FY19 has already been priced into the stock - and from here on out, Western Digital has a fairly low bar to cross. The company has also outlined that FY19 will be a year that focuses on cost reductions and optimizations, which may help to stem the EPS bleeding despite negative y/y revenue comps. Stay long on this name.Here's a look at Western Digital's key results in the second quarter:Figure 2. Western Digital 2Q19 resultsSource: Western Digital earnings announcementAs can be seen in the chart above, Western Digital dragged its feet across the board this quarter. Revenues declined -21% y/y to $4.23 billion, missing Wall Street's estimates of $4.26 billion (-20% y/y), but only by a hair.What is concerning is the fact that Western Digital's revenue decline worsened dramatically relative to last quarter. In Q1, Western Digital's revenues had only dropped by -3% y/y - a story that has now considerably worsened. Many actors are to blame: the company chiefly called out a weakening in NAND flash prices (a circumstance that has been echoed by memory suppliers across the industry for several quarters). In addition, however, the company also suffered a -17% sequential decline in hard drive exabytes sold. For much of 2018, memory investors had counted on the hard drive (HDD) segments of companies like Western Digital and Seagate Technology (STX) to keep earnings afloat while flash prices weakened.The good news is that Western Digital believes the slowdown in cloud and data center spending is a temporary pullback. Its long-term outlook for both HDD and NAND remains strong:Figure 3. Western Digital long-term outlookSource: Western Digital Q2 earnings deckSteve Milligan, Western Digital's CEO, continues to believe that the market will recover and that Western Digital's broad product portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from a cyclical bounce back. Per his comments on the Q2 earnings call:The difficult piece for investors to digest, however, is the margin deterioration - which has significantly eaten away at Western Digital's profits while investors await a return to normalization in memory trends. Gross margins fell seven points sequentially and twelve points on a year-over-year basis in Q2 - which, for a ""commoditized"" product with already-thin gross margins, is a major red flag. Furthermore, Western Digital expects this deterioration to persist - its Q3 guidance calls for pro forma gross margins of just ~28%.The impact on earnings has been heavy. Operating income was slashed in half, as was EPS, which fell to $1.45 (-53% y/y) and missed Wall Street consensus of $1.50 by a nickel. Perhaps even more drastically, Western Digital's free cash flows of ~$500 million in the year-ago quarter got whittled down to virtually zero.It's admittedly difficult to sound an upbeat note on a company whose performance has lagged over several quarters, and whose stock has seen minimal recovery after wiping out more than $10 billion in market value over the past few months. However, we look to a couple of bullish drivers in justifying a long-term investment in Western Digital:The fact that Western Digital's shares are rising despite a poor earnings quarter is a further signal that shares are oversold, and that not much is needed to stoke a rally. Continue to hold on to Western Digital - the recovery will be rewarding."

As WDC continues to decline, the stock appears to become more and more attractive from a risk-reward standpoint. The sentiment has slowly begun to shift to a more positive outlook than we saw this past year as Craig-Hallum steps up first, upgrading Western Digital from a Hold to a Buy back in December. Moving beyond peak sales, this cyclical stock will look to establish a bottom in 2019 to build upon going forward. Dipping well below 5-year lows, I believe that the bottom may have been reached or is near reaching a point where buying with a long-term mindset is a good play, if the investor can remain patient and disciplined going forward. WDC, in my opinion, is one of the best cyclical plays, as it offers an over 5% dividend that pays you to wait for the bounceback that companies such as Micron (MU) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) do not offer.Figure 1: Western Digital Has A Strong Line Of Industry-Leading Cyclical Products, So It Is Just A Matter Of Time Before The Stock Can Turn AroundWith talks of potential dividend cuts being thrown around, WDC may fall even more before it is time to get in. I believe the stock could fall to as low as $30 following the earnings announcement on January 24th, opening up a tremendous buying opportunity for long-term investors. WDC is a long ways away from testing new highs, but patience should pay off, with potential for over 50% returns within the next 1-3 years.Western Digital offers one of the most undervalued EV/EBITDA ratios in the industry, trading at less than 4x (Figure 2). The company is valued at nearly half of some its closest peers such as Seagate (STX), indicating potential for nearly 100% gains on undervaluation alone. Much of this undervaluation is due to Western Digital's high debt-to-cash flow ratio (3.94x) causing fear of financial declines and dividend cuts, but the company trades in line with peers for the most part when based on debt-to-equity (Figure 3), so this fear may be overblown, in my opinion.WDC EV to EBITDA (TTM) data by YChartsFigure 2: Western Digital Has A Very Attractive Valuation Compared To Peers, With Plenty Of Room For GrowthAnalysts are projecting a respectable year of growth for WDC, with EPS estimates pointing towards around 8% growth and revenue increasing around 2%. After reporting losses from 2017 to 2018, these increases possibly signal the start of a fresh cycle for Western Digital. A cheap 5.4x forward P/E ratio indicates even greater undervaluation going forward. The reward continues to grow as this stock continues to decline and at the same time the risk continues to shrink.WDC Debt to Equity Ratio (Annual) data by YChartsFigure 3: WDC Has A Rather High Amount Of Debt, But This May Not Be As Big Of An Issue As It May Seem When Looking At Total Equity As Well, And How This Compares To CompetitorsWestern Digital has over $11 billion in total debt, a substantially large number for a small- to mid-cap company, and just around $4.7 billion in cash to go with it. With free cash flow on the decline, WDC will have to work to keep this from becoming a bigger issue. The good news is that Western Digital is in much better shape in this area than many of its competitors, and the company has done well for almost 50 years now since its founding back in 1970, so in reality, management should have this taken care of. Short-term debt is very low ($213 million), so I do not see debt as a major issue going forward.Another risk with Western Digital is the talks of a dividend cut on the horizon. Analyst C.J. Muse of Evercore recently gave his take on the issue, stating that a $2.00 annual dividend will be hard to manage with declining free cash flow and high debt. Fierce competition in the sector has led to a very cyclical business as WDC's top products battle names such as Seagate and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY). The good news is the risk in investing in WDC is falling as the price becomes cheaper and cheaper.Western Digital is expected to report earnings after the market close on January 24, 2019. Heading into earnings, I think it may be smart to buy a small position, as the stock is down around 60% from its highs, and it is as good of time as ever to begin raking in that 5% dividend yield the company offers. I believe a dividend cut has already been priced into the stock after the nearly 8% dip on the Evercore estimates, and so, if the dividend were maintained, this stock could jump. Western Digital and Micron are two of the cheapest stocks in the market compared to peers, and with the dividend and history behind WDC, I believe it offers less risk and higher reward than just about any tech stock in the market if the investor is willing to wait 1-3 years for the cycle to play out (Figure 4). Based upon an approximately 40% undervaluation to competitors when looking at EV/EBITDA and around 10% growth projected over the next year, I think this stock could very easily reach $53, or a total of around 50% gains, by the year end, and find even higher highs in the years following as consumer demand regains its footing and sales pick back up.WDC data by YChartsFigure 4: WDC Has Been An Extremely Cyclical Stock For The Last Decade+ And Will Look To Find New Highs Once A Bottom Is EstablishedNearing closer and closer to 10-year lows, Western Digital has very little risk at these points compared to the rest of the tech sector. The company develops industry-leading products in all different types of areas, creating a diverse portfolio. I do not see this stock declining below $30 a share anytime in the foreseeable future, even if it reports a rough earnings call with dividend cuts. That being said, a stock with a 50%+ upside due to undervaluation and shift in cyclical growth and less than -15% downside over a 1-3 year span with compounding quarterly dividends not found much anywhere else in the sector or even the market sounds like a very good move for patient investors."

With the stock also offering a generous dividend yield, investors are not on board with the company at this time. In the last three weeks, five out of the last six analyst ratings were an unconvincing “hold” with just one analyst calling WDC stock a “buy.” As the P/E continues to compress and the stock closes at new lows, when will it stage a comeback?In the last three weeks, Western Digital earned only one upgrade. Analyst Christian Schwab of Craig-Hallum, which tipranks ranked as #448 out of 5,108 analysts, set a $59 price target. The upside of over 40% requires that the oversupply in the flash market will normalize, trade tensions ease, and global macro-economic environment improve. All three potential catalysts are hard to predict. Still, as in previous semiconductor cycles, the excess supply and weak pricing always work themselves out over time. Fortunately, WDC’s recovery may come sooner because the current downturn is both shallow in magnitude and brief in the length of time.Source: tipranksMuch of the macro uncertainties driving demand lower is created artificially, to the detriment of Western Digital’s business and for the technology sector as a whole. When the U.S. introduced a 10% tariff against China, the move should only have given the U.S. an initial bargaining chip. Instead, China may still face debilitating tariffs of 25%. This hurts not only the Chinese economy but well-run firms like Western Digital.The multi-year process of transforming all facets of data digitally continues. This will guarantee a minimum level of demand from data centers. Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, autonomous driving, IoT, and mobility are all growing for the next few years. That chip companies like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Intel (INTC), and NXP Semiconductors (NXPI) are trading lower on the market runs contrary to what's actually happening in the digital business. WDC shaped its business and moved away from supplying just storage components to leveraging its IP and technology.Finding ways to share data securely will drive WDC’s business growth in the long term. In a data-centric world, enterprise customers will demand more data and data privacy solutions in its infrastructure. And as the online marketplace makes its way in industries like agriculture, supply chain management will need a way to securely exchange data.WDC said that 80,000 organizations will exchange 12 exabytes of data daily. This is worth $14 billion in revenue potential. The total value of such a market place is $3.6 trillion.The core cloud, which started by centralizing computers and then offered virtualization, continues to evolve. AMD and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) both announced specialized GPU hardware for machines that are the backbone of cloud computing. In the current quarter, AMD said it would refresh EPYC. The 7-nanometer GPU on EPYC will drive demand as customers buy the latest solutions powered by the most advanced chips. This order pick-up also should help sustain demand for WDC storage.Even though smartphone demand peaked 1-2 years ago, content creation targeting this channel continues to grow. And while suppliers of Apple (AAPL) all signal weaker demand ahead for the latest iPhone, WDC will still benefit from another market that's growing at an even faster pace: The autonomous car market. The demand levels for autonomous cars is 4 terabytes of data daily. The magnitude of data demand increases for such cars, smartphones, and PC when they are all connected to an IoT ecosystem.Western Digital’s stock, which is down ~60% from 52-week highs, does not price in the growth in storage demands in the years ahead. Instead, the market is discounting the near-term disruptions that may hurt revenue and profits.Investors cannot ignore the near-term risks WDC faces. Prices for NAND may fall at a faster pace if trade between the U.S. and China worsens in 2019. Chinese firms that ordered more chips ahead of the tariffs may now cut orders in the current quarter.Value investors may ignore favorable valuations for WDC stock and the 4.8% dividend yield by interpreting the P/E multiples compression as a signal for a dividend cut and a slowdown ahead. For months, Micron Technology (MU) traded at a P/E in the range of 5 – 7 times, attracting value investors as the stock fell throughout 2018. Now at a 3 times P/E, investors now know markets are valuing plenty of headwinds for the DRAM and NAND supplier.Below: The forward P/E topped out in the middle of this year and trended lower. Seagate Technology (STX) fell in sympathy to WDC's decline on the markets even though the company reported first quarter revenue growing 14% Y/Y. Its GAAP EPS of $1.54 beat consensus by $0.11. The company also said it would buy back $2.3 billion of its shares but that news failed to stop the stock's decline.Seagate forecast its SSD revenue up in the double-digits, sequentially.Since investors have a sense on revenue levels in the next year and beyond, use a revenue multiples model to estimate WDC's fair value.Source: finbox.ioAssume an EV/LTM revenue in the range o 0.5 times to 1.3 times: Source: finbox.io (open link to change assumptions to model)Using the same multiples for the EV/Fwd revenue, the fair value of Western Digital Stock is somewhere in the mid-40s.Western Digital may break below $40 - $4 1 in the weeks ahead if market volatility increases. If investors are unwilling to buy this value stock, those who don’t hold it may want to wait a while longer before starting a position. Buying WDC when others are doing so will mean missing the bottom. In return, investors will benefit from the stock moving higher alongside the big tech names."

Most of these stocks are at or near 52-week lows, offer at least a decent dividend yield, and have no risk of going out of business as they are all stalwarts in their sectors. I’m not saying that the share price pain won’t continue or other names won’t beat these names in terms of total return, but these are relatively safe, conservative holdings that should revert to the mean. I’ve ordered the companies from low to higher risk.Image from finviz.comConsistently leading the pack of US big banks in terms of operating metrics such as efficiency ratio(~57%), JPM remains my top pick in the financial sector. Consistent dividend growth over the years coupled with the stock market sell-off have resulted in a yield of 3.2%. With near-ubiquitous branches and a debut into the asset management space with zero or near zero commissions on many ETFs, JPM should continue to see its user base and deposits grow.Many quarters of double digit revenue growth are great to see, and while they have their share of lawsuits and controversies, they look great compared to the still-frozen Wells Fargo (WFC). A recession will certainly drag down the share price and assets under management a bit, but that’s true for most stocks.Image from Seeking AlphaThe last time that JPM was this cheap was over a year ago in November 2017. Since Q3 ‘17, JPM has increased EPS by 33%, yet its share price today is at the same level. That fact screams value to me and I will be looking to pick up shares under $100.Image from finviz.comMoral investing decisions aside, Altria ironically represents safety in the investment space. As a purveyor of “vice products” such as alcohol through their Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) stake and wineries, traditional cigarettes through brands like Marlboro, smokeless tobacco like Skoal, vaping products and pending IQOS heatsticks, MO has an abundance of wonderfully branded and popular products. Despite the fact that cigarette use among US citizens is among all time lows, the demand for these products is not going to drop due to a recession. MO has wisely diversified its product line with recent investments into cannabis and Juul, which is currently in talks with Altria over a stake in the company.The main worry with Altria in my opinion remains the FDA’s reluctance to play ball with cigarette companies. I can’t say I blame them, but some of the decisions by the FDA are happening rather randomly. One week it’s issuing warnings on e-cigarettes, the next it’s banning menthol flavored products, then it’s seizing documents at Juul.Image from Seeking AlphaDespite the headline whiplash, Altria has shown consistent EPS growth and share count reduction. With an oft-repeated goal of a payout ratio of 80%, management has been and will continue to be incredibly shareholder friendly. The dividend yield is now at 6% which has historically only happened during or immediately after a market crash. A PE ratio of below 10 represents great value for a stock that should effectively be recession-resistant. We will have to see if they overpay for some of these recent acquisitions, but barring that this stock should remain solid for the foreseeable future.Image from finviz.comThe investment thesis for Walmart hasn’t changed; the retail giant is still making billions of dollars while aggressively trying to fight off Amazon (AMZN) for e-commerce traffic. Huge investments in e-commerce such as in India with the Flipkart majority stake show the commitment to achieve growth. Hopefully this will pay off for the company better than its other global investments which have been relatively poor performing. In the short term the deal will be a drag on EPS, but the long-term potential is there. Dividend yield of 2.2% isn’t anything to write home about, but it helps fight inflation.When I hear about how Walmart can't keep up with Amazon, I just look at this table and laugh:Image taken from article by The Investment Strategist published 4/28/18Great performance metrics and traffic growth popped the stock upwards only to be whittled back down by trade war and tariffs concerns. Perhaps most importantly, WMT managed to grow online sales by 43% for the latest quarter which beat the prior quarter of 40%. That figure alone tells me that their efforts are already being successful. Anecdotally, I managed to find everything that I was going to purchase on Amazon at either the same price or lower on Walmart.com. With comparable shipping speeds that don’t require a costly membership, I would not be surprised if WMT shows another blowout online sales quarter.Other tailwinds for WMT include retailer bankruptcies like Toys R Us which should cause many of those shoppers to go to Walmart or Target instead. Potentially easing trade tensions should also help remove the cloud over the share price. If a recession were to occur, Walmart might even see more shoppers than normal, a la 2009, as people with less money in their pockets want the best price possible.Image from finviz.comAs an investor that loves REITs, I couldn’t help but put one on the list. New Residential is not a traditional mortgage REIT, but rather one that services the mortgages in exchange for a small fee. Magnify that fee by half a trillion dollars worth of mortgages and you can quickly see how NRZ makes more than a pretty penny. In addition to these mortgage servicing rights, NRZ also makes consumer loans and servicer advances. These assets produce a fantastic yield on cost, with the main issue being that the assets are depreciating in nature. As more and more of the loans are repaid, assets shrink. While NRZ has been brilliant at replacing these assets, there is concern out there that someday the magic will fade.Image from Q3 Earnings SlidesI do not believe that it will, and my article history shows that I have been a long-term believer in this company. Book value continues to rise in an environment that has seen virtually every peer dwindle, and core earnings of $0.63 easily out-earn the generous $0.50 dividend (yield is 12.4% at time of writing).If this stock is so great, then what has happened to the share price lately? Other than the secondary offering of 25 million shares, there are sector jitters about the profitability of the mREIT sector with such a flat yield curve. As long as consumers continue to make payments, NRZ will be in fantastic shape. High mortgage rates, with the fixed 30-year rate near 4.8%, have also meant that no one in their right mind would refinance their mortgage. Lower refinance rates help extend the lifespan of NRZ’s mortgage servicing rights, which leads to greater returns.NRZ has recovered quickly after every drop, and with the more than $400 million of dry powder from the secondary offering on the balance sheet, we should soon hear of the next great addition to NRZ’s portfolio.Image from finviz.comWestern Digital does not get much love from Mr. Market, as tech, semiconductor and flash memory companies are in the toilet. That chart looks absolutely atrocious, and the main cause of the massive 62% decline from 52-week highs is due to deteriorating average sales price of flash and storage products. The trade war with China has also thrown a wrench into plans for a recovery due to tariffs and reduced market access. Micron (MU) has been struggling right there alongside WDC and has a similar looking chart.I believe that the punishment is overdone. I made a similar call when shares were in the high 50’s, and I was too early. The company is priced like it isn’t cash flow positive, and WDC makes plenty of money. Gross margins remain at 38 percent FCF comes in a touch under $500 million for the quarter. The $0.50 quarterly dividend remains easily covered and the yield is now at 5%, which is a historic high for the stock.Image from Seeking AlphaWith new products like MAMR, superior to HAMR from Seagate (STX), which will increase storage potential and decrease costs, the future is bright for WDC. In an increasingly data-heavy and connected world, storage will continue to be vital. If you can put up with seeing red for a little while longer, the long term share price growth seems like a good bet.Robinhood recently announced a no-fee online checking and savings account.

4216292,103501,2018-10-31T02:45:52-04:00,"Western Digital looks like a long-term buy after plunging 18% on releasing Q1 fiscal year 2019 results on October 25 that disappointed the market.Western Digital's shares now trade at a mere 2.8x FY 2018 non-GAAP EPS of $14.73.The company's $4.8B cash pile, representing 39.7% of its market cap, should provide some support through the downturn of the next cycle.Financial leverage is currently at 2.54x and the interest coverage ratio a healthy 9.5x in the latest quarter.","Western Digital (WDC) plunged 18% after releasing Q1 fiscal year (FY) 2019 results on October 25th that disappointed the market. The company reported revenue that was $200M lower than Q1 in the prior year as management noted it is seeing declines in flash pricing. The company also reported lower non-GAAP EPS for the quarter of $3.04 compared to $3.56 a year ago. Mr. Market was quick to adjust that the industry might be heading for more declines in memory pricing, but value investors might want to take a step back and consider the long-term picture given that shares now trade at 2.8x FY 2018 non-GAAP EPS of $14.73.WDC data by YChartsIn a world where data is becoming an increasingly important part of our lives and the backbone of business operations, I think that Western Digital has a bright future ahead of it as memory storage needs to be both replaced as it gets old and increased over time as the amount of data grows. That being said, memory storage seems to be a commodity type of product in my opinion with one company's storage product little differentiated from the next. Like oil companies expanding production during price and demand uptrends only to have to scale back production when the market turns, Western Digital's management noted in its Q1 release that it is taking immediate actions to align its flash output with projected demand. This is not the first time we have heard this type of market reaction due to cyclical swings in the memory storage industry (as shown in the graph of Western Digital below). Like many commodity cycles, pullbacks in production from industry competitors should set the market up for its next supply and demand imbalance.WDC data by YChartsWith $4.8B of cash and equivalents on the balance sheet as of the end of Q1 FY 2019, Western Digital's $12.1B market cap is now a whopping 39.7% cash and equivalents! This cash should also give it some stability to ride out the next business cycle. The company generated $705M in cash from operations during the first fiscal quarter of 2019 and returned $711M to shareholders in the form of dividends ($148M) and share repurchases ($563M). It might be time for value investors to hold their stomachs and take a look at Western Digital for a long-term investment.Western Digital's strong product portfolio has allowed the company to achieve average return on equity (ROE) and return on invested capital (ROIC) of 14.1 and 11.79%, respectively, over the past decade. While the company is cyclical along with the industry, this average level of profitability is well above my rule of thumb of 9% ROIC, allowing me to be confident that, in my opinion, the company is able to maintain and continue to increase its intrinsic value over a business cycle.Source data from MorningstarOn the growth side, book value per share has grown from $14.32 in 2008 to $39.73, which when combined with the dividends paid out from equity has an average growth of 14.8% annually which supports the ROE and ROIC averages.While more financially leveraged than at the beginning of the decade, Western Digital still currently looks to be in a strong financial position. With financial leverage currently at 2.54x and its interest coverage ratio a healthy 9.5x in the latest quarter, the company looks ready to handle the next cyclical downturn.Source data from MorningstarThe company's share count has continued to inch up over the past decade as shares have been issued to support acquisitions which have been a big part of the company's capital budget and have helped it keep its product offerings current. Western Digital's large $19B purchase of SanDisk back in 2015 brought the company deeper into the NAND flash memory market, but also significantly added to the debt and share count. Back in Q4 FY 2018, Western Digital authorized a $5B share buyback which it has begun to act on but have lots of room left for more repurchases.The company's decline in ROIC since this acquisition leads me to worry that intangible assets from the acquisition might need to be written down. However, free cash flow per share has remained strong since the acquisition, signalling in my opinion that the economics of the combined business's cash flows remain intact.Source data from MorningstarI always like to examine the relationship between average ROE and price-to-book value. This relationship is especially important for cyclical companies and is something I consider similar to Shiller's CAPE ratio but a little simpler to calculate in my opinion. It examines the average ROE over a business cycle and adjusts that ROE for the price investors are currently paying for the company's book value or equity per share. With Western Digital earning an average ROE of 14.1% over the past decade and the shares currently trading at a price to book value of 1.04x when the price is $41.37, this would yield a similar adjusted ROE of 14.2% for an investor's equity at that purchase price around book value, if history repeats itself. This is above the 9% that I like to see and adding a 3% growth rate to represent the company growing alongside GDP could increase this potential total return up to 17.2%.Source data from MorningstarMr. Market may have gotten ahead of himself as he tried to price in valuations the next memory storage cycle downturn. Western Digital has been a hugely profitable company over the last cycle and the shares look attractive to long-term investors trading at only 14.1% adjusted ROE-to-Price/Book value. The company's $4.8B cash pile, representing 40% of its market cap, should provide some support through the next cycle along with the dividend of $2.00 per share (4.8% yield) as investors wait for more favourable times.If you enjoyed this article and would like to read more of my work, click the ""Follow"" button at the top of the page to receive notifications when I post a new article!Disclaimer: While the information and data presented in my articles are obtained from company documents and/or sources believed to be reliable, they have not been independently verified.

4215326,22786,2018-10-29T07:20:46-04:00,Western Digital lost 18% in market cap when it reported quarterly results.Selling on that day and in the last year more than compensates for the uncertainties ahead.Output in wafers adjusting to align with weaker flash prices.WDC stock trades at fair value.,"After lowering its supply forecasts for the next quarter and pushing out a timeline for a recovery for some time in 2019, Western Digital (WDC) fell 18% on the day. At a P/E of 6.3 times and an even lower forward P/E of 3.79 times, should investors dive into the stock when the dividend now yields 4.53%?In the first quarter (Q1/2019), WDC's revenues benefited from strong performance in enterprise and surveillance storage demand. That and embedded flash solutions both grew by over 30%. But markets fretted over the decline in flash average selling prices. This warning is nothing new. In its last quarter, management already said it was facing pricing pressure in NAND. What changed in the three months is that the company will now take a small charge to cut output and work through the lower demand-supply equilibrium.Macro headwinds also hurt results, from China/U.S. trade wars escalating, unfavorable forex, and an economic deceleration globally. WDC will cut its wafer output in six months, or in fiscal Q3/2019. For investors wondering what to do next, it depends on two things. Investment time horizon and expectations in the long-term for Western Digital. As expected, WDC's management said long-term, storage demand will continue. Current demand for massive storage devices like the 15-terabyte drive, embedded flash drive in high-end smartphones, and ActiveScale within data center systems will not worsen.The excess supply of flash will lead to a 10% to 15% drop in bit output in CY 2019. Western Digital's 18% drop on October 26, along with a 37% drop in the quarter and 44% drop YTD, probably more than prices in the output cut. The market is tripling its discounting on WDC shares. This bearishness appears overdone and could attract bargain hunters to snap up the stock in the $40-45 range over the next few weeks.Unfortunately, Texas Instruments (TXN) also reported a weak quarter and forecast weakness ahead. AT&T (T) fell when its satellite TV business missed expectations. STMicroelectronics (STM) reported strong growth and demand in the autonomous driving space but confirmed the slowdown in China was real. The selling in these companies is bad news for Western Digital shareholders because their shares are now at a deeper discount, too. Value investors now have plenty of choices to pick from. Yet none of these stocks will rebound in the short-term if China's slowdown gets worse. If the U.S. slaps more tariffs on the country, this will hurt demand for technology parts.Of the stocks selling off last week, AT&T offers a better dividend yield of 6.88%. Texas Instruments' dividend yield is 3.4%, below WDC's 4.53%. STMicro may have a lower dividend yield of below 2%, but trades at a PEG of just 0.26 times. STMicro will offset its weaker-than-expected business in China by growing revenue for ADAS-related parts.Data storage competitor Seagate Technology (STX), which reports this week on Nov. 2, has an even better dividend than Western Digital, at 6.49%.Below: WDC and Seagate stock in the last year.WDC data by YChartsIncome investors could consider any of these plays, but still need more assurances that the slowdown in key markets will reverse. Until then, the dividend may not offset potential losses incurred by holding these stocks while they fall further.WDC enjoyed steady revenue in most of its segments in the previous quarter. That changed in Q1 when even Data Center capital expenditure, especially from large cloud service providers, fell unexpectedly. Investors now realize the customers may have over-ordered parts earlier in the year for budgetary reasons. Conversely, they may also forecast a slowdown ahead and are cutting back on orders to adjust. Western Digital still forecast capacity enterprise exabyte growth of ~55%. Growth will pick up again in calendar 2H/2019.In the flash-based market, average selling prices fell 16%, causing total revenue to decline 3% to $5 billion.The company bought back $563 million worth of shares in the quarter. It will buy back another $1.5 billion in the next nine months (for the full FY2019). That, along with a $0.50 quarterly dividend, may set the stage for the stock to bottom at or near current levels.Using a Revenue Multiples model, investors may select Seagate, Micron Technology (MU), HP Inc. (HPQ) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (HPE) as comparables. With an EV/LTM Revenue multiple of 0.7-1.0x, the stock is trading at a fair value. The downside from this level should be minimal and any more drop would be due to markets falling further into correction territory."

Not quite yet finished with a bear market correction that has sliced off more than half of its market value (relative to recent peaks reached earlier this year), Western Digital shares dropped a fresh 12% after reporting weaker-than-expected Q1 results and guiding low for the year.WDC data by YChartsWhen we take a step back, however, it seems more than likely that Western Digital's post-earnings reaction was overdone. We've been expecting mild pricing drops on memory for quite a while now - Wall Street analysts have been pouncing on weaker demand scenarios for both DRAM and NAND memory over the past several months, leading to unprecedented weakness in shares of Western Digital and fellow memory company Micron (MU). When we additionally account for the fact that Western Digital trades at a ~5x forward P/E, it seems that a weaker demand scenario has already been priced in.Yes, Western Digital has been painful to hold - but there really isn't much further to drop. Think of this quarter as the ""big bath"" quarter in which all the negative news gets churned out at once. We've always known that the memory industry is extremely cyclical - but that's no different from energy companies or auto stocks. That doesn't make the underlying businesses un-investable.One of the main reasons I'm remaining optimistic on Western Digital is its fresh buyback program, a $5 billion authorization from the board of directors that now seems quite well-timed. Western Digital's market cap, after Q3, has now slipped below $15 billion - it's rare to see any company with a buyback program that covers more than one-third of its market cap. And, as I noted in a prior article, Western Digital has significantly de-leveraged its balance sheet relative to the last downturn in the memory cycle, so it's much better prepared to persevere through a contraction in revenues.Stay long on Western Digital. Though the stock has severely tested investors' patience, it is a value play unrivaled by just about any other stock in the tech sector.My main takeaway coming out of this quarter's results was that, though we certainly could have hoped for better, Western Digital's results and market commentary didn't exactly come out of left field. Investors have been expecting this downdraft for months - what else can explain this stock's dramatic fall from over $100 to below $50 in a matter of six months? Forget the volatility in internet and software stocks in the month of October - Western Digital's sheer volatility over the past year has been downright frightening.Western Digital offered the following commentary in its earnings deck:Figure 1. Western Digital market viewSource: Western Digital investor relationsIn response to weaker forecasted demand, Western Digital is taking about 15% of its production capacity offline. Note, though, that Western Digital's warning concerns primarily flash - the legacy hard drive (HDD) business remains fairly resilient to pricing movements.According to Western Digital, one of the major culprits behind memory weakness is the U.S.-China trade war. OEMs are being more cautious on loading up in inventory, and understandably so. In my view, though it may take some time, U.S.-China relations can't remain frigid forever.The world's two largest economies are undeniably intertwined, and when tensions thaw, Western Digital's enterprise customers will have enough confidence to restore their supplies again. As long as end-product sell-through remains strong, Western Digital's demand weakness is only a question of timing - eventually, it will have the opportunity to replenish the market with memory.For FY19, analysts are expecting EPS of $11.35, as reported by Yahoo Finance. That puts Western Digital at a P/E ratio of just 4.2x, based on current stock prices. Even if you slash EPS by 40%, Western Digital's P/E ratio would be at 7.0x. To me, a memory downturn is already priced into Western Digital's stock, especially with a $5 billion buyback waiting in the wings.Let's dive deeper into Western Digital's Q1 results. Here's a glance at the full earnings summary below:Figure 2. Western Digital 1Q19 resultsSource: Western Digital investor relationsI'll acknowledge that this wasn't a strong quarter for Western Digital, but for the stock's current bargain basement valuation, we shouldn't expect too much. Revenues declined -3% yy to $5.03 billion, missing Wall Street estimates of $5.14 billion (-1% y/y) by a mild two points.When we look at the detailed metrics below, we'll find that it's apparent both flash and HDD took a beating this quarter:Figure 3. Western Digital 1Q19 metricsSource: Western Digital investor relationsFlash shipments declined -16% y/y, echoing management's comments that customers were becoming more cautious. Again, however, we have to emphasize that while OEMs and enterprise buyers might be wary of loading up on inventory, it's really end-customer and end-product demand that will ultimately guide the long-term health of the flash business. Caution among Western Digital's buyers this quarter could easily just be a push-out of demand into future quarters.HDD units also fell by about -19% y/y, but notice ironically that HDD ASPs are up to $72. Western Digital has repeatedly emphasized that HDD will still be relevant in the future.On the more disappointing side, in my opinion, is the beginning of a deterioration in gross margins. Flash margins fell from 53% in 1Q18 to just 44% this quarter - though, consistent with HDD pricing, HDD margins stayed strong at 32% (actually one point better than 31% in the year-ago quarter). The dip in flash, however, dragged down total pro forma gross margins to 38%.0%, down 430bps from 42.3% in the year-ago quarter. Further, Western Digital expects margins to continue sliding, with a guidance range of 32-33% on a pro forma basis for the fiscal second quarter ending in December:Figure 4. Western Digital guidanceSource: Western Digital investor relationsOn the whole, however, given both a revenue decline and a margin contraction this quarter, Western Digital's bottom-line performance wasn't all too terrible. Net income dipped -25% y/y to $511 million, representing a still-strong net margin of 10.2% (versus 13.1% in the year-ago quarter), while pro forma EPS of $3.04 missed Wall Street consensus by just two cents and declined just -15% y/y. The relatively modest dip in EPS is reflective of how Western Digital's buybacks soften the blow of a tough memory cycle - this quarter, the company already executed $563 billion of its buyback program, according to the cash bridge below:Figure 5. Western Digital buyback and uses of cashSource: Western Digital investor relationsWhile Western Digital has certainly seen better days, not all is lost. Memory is a key component behind many critical products in both consumer and enterprise technology, and weaker customer orders this quarter may very well be backfilled in the near future once trade tensions dissipate. In the meantime, Western Digital has a powerful balance sheet and strong free cash flows to support a large $5 billion buyback program, which greatly helps to cushion the impact of revenue declines and lower margins.At this point, there's also not much left that can take Western Digital down further. A production slowdown and pricing warnings are just about the worst news the company can issue, and from here on out, Western Digital will be facing extremely muted expectations. Stay long and hold Western Digital through this bear cycle."
4205121,103480,2018-09-09T10:53:48-04:00,"Western Digital is now more than 50% off recent highs reached merely four months ago in April.Shares have hit a P/E ratio below 5x. That type of valuation would be understandable if Western Digital's earnings are expected to tank, but so far, fundamentals have remained steady.Even if memory pricing declines (worries about NAND prices is what sparked the recent selloff), manufacturing cost efficiencies will help keep gross margins high.Western Digital's new $5 billion buyback program can also buy back a third of Western Digital's market cap. Patient investors waiting for the rebound can also benefit from a 3.5% dividend yield.","The recent downturn in Western Digital (WDC) has been nothing short of scary. The giant memory maker was an investor favorite through April, when shares briefly touched a high above $100. Even then, with shares trading at a P/E ratio below 10, investors (including myself) were hoping that Western Digital could march higher.After all, fundamentals for the company were looking great. The hard drive business was vibrant, showing massive exabyte gains per quarter. Western Digital's NAND flash business - which has accelerated ever since its massive $19 billion takeover of SanDisk - provided a new avenue for growth in a higher-margin product segment. If we take a hard look at Western Digital now, we find that not much has changed since then.WDC data by YChartsSentiment for Western Digital has been weak ever since a string of analyst downgrades and a fresh spate of worries on the status of NAND pricing. In investors' eyes, Western Digital is still saddled with a mountain of debt from the SanDisk acquisition (though it has used its enormous free cash flows to cull down this debt load by 34% since the acquisition).Investors' memories are long, and we all fear the cataclysmic drop that Western Digital (and other memory stocks) suffered in 2015, when the memory markets were oversupplied. A quick reminder: from early 2015 through the summer of 2016, Western Digital's stock fell by two-thirds - from the $110 range to all-time lows in the mid-$30s. It seems now that Western Digital has nearly replicated that trend, falling from the $100s to the mid-$50s. This time, however, Western Digital's fundamentals are much stronger. It's generating growing earnings, thanks to strong enterprise demand for hard drives and Republican tax reform. It's been so successful that it has initiated a $5 billion buyback program, which can buy back nearly a third of Western Digital's $17 billion market cap and generate earnings growth even if margins fall.The trough this time will be quicker and more painless than last time, and I'm confident that Western Digital will rebound by year-end. This time, it's fear more than real market conditions that have pitched the stock downward. In the face of such negativity in the markets, let's review the bullish case for this storied memory maker:Buoyed by healthy memory markets, Western Digital's free cash flow generation over the past two years have been stunning. The company's earnings growth in FY18 was not due exclusively to Republican tax reform, though a lower tax bill was one of the major reasons behind the boost to earnings - the company also generated plenty of revenue growth, as its HDD business actually showed strength in shipment volumes. We'll discuss Western Digital's outlook on the memory market shortly, but take a look first at the numbers:Figure 1. Western Digital OCF and FCFSource: Western Digital investor relations$4.2 billion in operating cash flow, up 22% year over year, is no small potatoes. It's about a quarter of Western Digital's current market cap. Moving ahead, Western Digital should also be able to pick up its free cash flow generation as it stabilizes down its capex spending. It burned through an elevated level of capex investments this year to further its flash investments, but going forward, Western Digital expects to spend just 6-8% of revenues on capex, as noted in its long-term financial model:Figure 2. Western Digital long-term operating modelSource: Western Digital investor relationsWith annual revenues running at a ~$20 billion clip, 7% of revenues indicates about $1.4 billion spent on capex - less than what the company spent this year.The company is putting this cash generation to good use. In July, the company announced a new $5 billion share buyback program, which could buy back about a third of its market cap if the company executed it all today. If it wanted to, Western Digital could employ an age-old strategy from Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.B) (NYSE:BRK.A) book - buying back shares when the price is low. Just two years of Western Digital's free cash flow can fund this buyback program; by extension, six years could buy back Western Digital's entire market cap. This is another way to look at how absurdly undervalued Western Digital is.The company also includes dividends as part of its capital returns program, appeasing investors who want immediate gratification. Western Digital is currently yielding $0.50 per quarter, or $2.00 per year - against its current share price of $57, that's a juicy yield of 3.5%. It could do better than this if it wanted to: with Western Digital's consensus EPS for FY19 at $11.73 (per Yahoo Finance), its dividend payout ratio is a piddling 17%.One of the other fears that has mounted against Western Digital is its heavy debt load, most of which was incurred via the May 2016 SanDisk acquisition. However, Western Digital's huge cash flow generation has also been tremendously powerful in driving down its leverage ratios.Here's where Western Digital's debt stands as of the end of FY18 (the year ended in June):Figure 3. Western Digital debt, currentSource: Western Digital investor relationsThen let's go back two years ago to 4Q16, when Western Digital had just closed the SanDisk acquisition and its debt was at its peak of $17.1 billion:Figure 4. Western Digital debt, 4Q16Source: Western Digital investor relationsThe company has culled down its debt load by $5.7 billion, or 34%, since then. By refinancing its higher-yielding notes, Western Digital has also been able to pare down its weighted average interest rate to just under 3.7% - 190 bps better than two years ago. On ~$11 billion worth of debt, that's ~$200 million of annual interest savings.Western Digital is no Dell, weighed down by a $38 billion debt load, a stagnant PC market, and facing up against Trump's EBITDA limitation on interest deductions. Western Digital's debt load goes down each year, and stands at under 2x Western Digital's EBITDA of $6.05 billion in FY18 ($3.62 billion in operating income plus $2.06 billion in depreciation and amortization, plus $0.38 billion in stock comp). A Debt/EBITDA ratio under 2x is hardly leveraged at all.Let's forget the speculation on memory pricing and stick to what we know. Western Digital has guided to a long-term growth CAGR of 4-8% on the top line, about in line with its 8% revenue growth in FY18. This isn't a company that is expecting its industry to tip over. It wouldn't have issued a fresh $5 billion buyback program if it was expecting a downturn.Let's substantiate that assertion with commentary from Western Digital's management. Mark Long, Western Digital's CFO, recently spoke at Citi's annual TMT conference with upbeat comments about the health of the memory industry (link to Seeking Alpha transcript here).Addressing concerns that the hard drive market was dying, Long reinforced what Western Digital's results have clearly communicated over the past year: HDD is not a dying business. Enterprises need cheap storage for their reams of data, and Western Digital is seeing a strong pickup in HDD demand:Then, Long moved to discuss the flash side of the business - where concerns about pricing drops have rocked memory stocks from Western Digital to Micron (MU). Analysts and investors have long focused too much on the supply side of the picture - yes, it's true that flash manufacturers have ramped up capacity, but it's in response to a flood of demand:Evercore's research analyst believes flash pricing could fall in the low double digits in the first half of next year. This of course isn't ideal for Western Digital, but it won't be crippling. The last down-cycle was caused by a drop-off in demand; this time, demand seems to be just fine.Another key point is the fact that while Western Digital also believes ASPs will come down, ""the goal is to ensure that we can get a similar rate of cost declines"". If unit volumes remain constant, and Western Digital's cost reductions (annual cost decreases are normal in the semiconductor space) can match the price declines, Western Digital's gross margin dollars are safe.In my view, weakness in sentiment shouldn't prevent investors from seeing the value in Western Digital's stock. At <5x forward earnings, and supported by a strong dividend yield and EPS-driving share buyback program, Western Digital remains a strong buy."

4212837,68315,2018-10-22T09:00:52-04:00,"NAND worries have led to a big slump in Western Digital's share price.Demand growth and lower capital expenditures by NAND manufacturers will lead to improved NAND pricing in the future, and demand for storage devices will continue to grow.Western Digital's shares are very inexpensive, the long-term growth outlook is compelling, and investors get a big dividend on top of that.","Western Digital (WDC) has been impacted by worries about demand trends for data storage devices. The company's share price has dropped by almost 50% from the 52-week high which was set in July.Western Digital remains highly profitable, though, and it is unlikely that the company will shrink perpetually. The very low valuation Western Digital is trading at right now could allow for substantial share price gains and attractive total returns, even in a low-growth scenario.Western Digital is a data storage device manufacturer that produces hard disk drives and solid state drives (HDD and SSD), and which is also selling 3D NAND flash memory. With its products, Western Digital addresses different markets, including enterprise storage and personal computing.WDC data by YChartsBoth Western Digital's revenues and its share price have seen major ups and downs over the last decade, although revenues clearly are in an overall uptrend, whereas share price movements have been more erratic.WDC data by YChartsOver the last three months, the hardware IT sector as a whole saw declining share prices, especially those companies that have exposure to the NAND market saw their share prices drop substantially. This does include Western Digital and also companies such as Micron (MU).The belief that NAND prices will fall substantially over the coming years has pressured the share prices of companies with NAND exposure due to the belief that lower NAND prices will lead to declining margins for manufacturers. Analysts have repeatedly warned about an oversupply situation, or about a flash memory price crash.Market participants have already reacted to the supply-demand situation that is seemingly shifting into the wrong directions. Both Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) (OTC:SSNNF) and SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) (OTC:HXSCL) have announced that they postponed expansion plans, which will lead to less new supply coming to the market in the foreseeable future.At the same time, demand for memory chips should continue to grow, as several major long-term trends drive data volumes at a strong pace. This includes cloud computing, the Internet of Things, autonomous driving, and smart homes. The rising amount of technology that we use for entertainment, e.g. through (mobile) gaming and augmented or virtual reality hardware, leads to a growing demand for memory chips as well.Even if NAND prices fall substantially during the next couple of months, it seems highly likely that prices will rise towards a higher level over the coming years, as new supply will be restricted due to lower investments, while demand continues to grow due to a multitude of growth drivers.In the very unrealistic scenario where NAND prices fall and do not recover ever again, Western Digital would still not be forced out of business, as NAND memory makes up a relatively small portion of the company's total revenues. Western Digital's position in HDDs and SSDs is immune to NAND price changes, and Western Digital will benefit from growing demand for HDDs and SSDs over the coming years.Source: Western Digital presentationWestern Digital offers high-capacity storage drives with up to 14 TB of data storage capacity, and on top of that Western Digital offers SSDs with up to 15 TB of storage capacity.These products are highly attractive for cloud computing companies that require immense storage capacities. On top of that, these products can also be used by other enterprise customers, for data centers, deep learning, etc.Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Big Data, and other trends lead to exponential growth in the amount of data that is stored, and at the same time, the value of data continues to grow as well. This means that Western Digital's customers will be keen on spending cash on top-tier hardware products that will allow them to capture the value that is created by analyzing these massive amounts of data.Source: cbronline.comData center capital expenditures are growing around the globe, especially hyperscale data center spending is growing at a massive pace. The top spenders, including Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Facebook (FB), are ramping up their investments into data centers consistently, which will be a major demand tailwind for Western Digital and other suppliers of storage products.The strength of the global economy, including in the US, makes it easier for companies to increase their investments as well. Higher profits by US and foreign corporations give them the financial flexibility to invest in new technologies and to increase their capital expenditures, which should be beneficial for Western Digital and its peers.All in all, it seems likely that Western Digital will not fall off a cliff. The company will likely benefit from growing demand for its products, and NAND flash prices should normalize due to lower capital expenditures by NAND manufacturers. It seems likely that Western Digital will be able to record positive sales growth rates over the coming years.The strong demand trends have allowed Western Digital to grow its revenues substantially during the last fiscal year, and thanks to operating leverage and a lower share count, Western Digital's earnings per share grew at an even more compelling rate during the last couple of quarters.Source: Western Digital presentationDuring Q4, Western Digital has recorded a 23% earnings per share growth rate, for all of fiscal 2018 the growth rate was even stronger, at 60%. Revenue growth and positive operating leverage were factors, but Western Digital also benefited from lower interest expenses:Source: Western Digital 10-K filingThe company has reduced its long-term debt by ~$2 billion over the last year, which has led to a decrease in Western Digital's interest expenses. The total debt level of $11 billion is not low, but since Western Digital holds a $5 billion cash position on its balance sheet, its net debt is just $6 billion. Relative to the cash flows that Western Digital generates the net debt position of $6 billion does not seem large:Source: Western Digital 10-K filingThe company generated operating cash flows of $4.2 billion during the last four quarters, which means that its net debt totals just 1.4 times its annual cash flows. When we account for capital expenditures, including for joint ventures, Western Digital has produced free cash flows of $2.7 billion during the last four quarters.For a company with a market capitalization of just $16.7 billion, that is a very strong cash generation, shares trade at a trailing free cash flow yield of 16.2%. With these massive free cash flows, Western Digital can pursue several things, including paying its dividend (which yields 3.6%), buying back shares, and paying down debt.As Western Digital's dividend payments total just $600 million a year, Western Digital could spend $2.1 billion a year on buybacks and paying down debt, assuming cash flows do not grow or decline going forward. If management splits the available cash flows in half, the company could pay down $1.05 billion in debt a year, which would reduce Western Digital's net debt to zero in less than six years.At the same time, Western Digital could also repurchase about 19 million shares a year as long as shares trade at the current price, which would result in an annual share count reduction of more than 6%. It could be in shareholders' interest for Western Digital to prioritize share repurchases as long as shares remain very inexpensive, as Western Digital could buy back more than 12% of its share count a year if debt reduction is postponed.WDC EPS Estimates for Current Fiscal Year data by YChartsProfit estimates for this year and for next year have declined slightly over the last couple of weeks, but the analyst community still sees profits of more than $11 per share during fiscal 2019 (current year) and fiscal 2020, and profits of $12.40 during fiscal 2021.Based on a share price of $56, Western Digital is thus trading for just 5.0 times this year's earnings right now, with positive earnings growth rates being forecasted for the coming years.WDC EPS LT Growth Estimates data by YChartsThe long-term EPS growth rate that analysts are forecasting right now is 13%, which is higher than it was most of the time over the last five years. Due to the positive demand trends for storage hardware and the potential in NAND flash storage, coupled with the positive impact of buybacks, the 13% earnings per share growth rate seems achievable.Western Digital's business is cyclical, and NAND will likely be a headwind over the next couple of quarters, but nevertheless, shares look like a good value right here. Investors can buy shares of Western Digital at 5 times this year's earnings, profits will likely grow slightly during 2020 and substantially beyond 2020, and on top of that, there is a dividend yielding 3.6%.Western Digital's share price has slumped almost 50% over the last couple of months, based on worries about the NAND market. Due to lower capital expenditures by NAND manufacturers and due to growing demand, this will not be a long-term headwind, though.Western Digital is highly profitable, generates massive cash flows, debt levels are shrinking, and shareholders get a juicy dividend while waiting for the long-term growth drivers to play out. For investors who can stomach the cyclicality and high volatility, Western Digital could be a compelling investment, I believe.Author's note: If you enjoyed this article and would like to read more from me, you can hit the ""Follow"" button to get informed about new articles.

        The stock is far too cheap to ignore, despite near-term headwinds in flash memory pricing.
        Enterprise sales will sustain revenue growth while investors collect a dividend.","June’s bullish call that storage supply Western Digital Corporation (WDC) would have 25 percent upside is not playing out at all. By late-July, the stock broke its 1-year support of $75, free-falling to $64.79 last Friday, August 10. The fourth-quarter earnings report spooked investors. Despite beating on EPS and revenue, management voiced concerns over the semiconductor cycle. At a P/E of 8.65 times and a forward P/E of 5 times, this storage stock looks as inexpensive as Micron Technology (MU), which trades at a 5x P/E and 4.4x forward P/E. Why should value investors believe in any upside in Western Digital, with the stock now hovering at 52-week lows?WDC grew revenue at the high end of its long-term range of 4 – 8 percent. Gross margin, albeit non-GAAP, rose ~ 5 percent to a record: 42.5 percent. Tight demand-supply dynamics drove profitability higher, thanks to storage demand drivers. This includes surveillance requiring more storage and smartphones having more storage capacity. The industry shifted from 2D to 3D and then 3D to higher layer counts. Yields improved and flash supply growth is increasing.Micron stock is up an incredible 83 percent already so a decline to the $51 range is not detrimental to the long-term investor. Seagate failed to move higher since late March, while WDC is the worst of the three, down 18.9 percent in the one-year period:Management countered these great numbers with a warning on the growth cycle. Software demand, caused by a slowdown in mobility, hurt flash pricing at a faster pace than the historical average. This pressure will continue through the rest of the year.Micron investors are used to holding a dirt cheap stock, frustrated by the stock’s inability to break-out above $60 - $65. Instead, MU shares are close to $50 as the market factors in a slowdown for the remainder of the year. Yet the play here for both MU, WDC, and Seagate Technologies (STX), is to wait out the short-term volatility and to continue holding the stock. The storage suppliers have an edge over Micron: WDC’s dividend yields 3 percent and Seagate’s is nearly 5 percent. Conversely, Micron is spending its strong cash flow to pay down debt. In that regard, Micron has a superior balance sheet profile because it is not weighed down by debt.WDC generated $4.2 billion in OCF (operating cash flow). In the June quarter, it returned $150 million through dividends and $436 million through share buybacks. It targets a share buyback of $1.5 billion in the next 12 months. So, as the stock tumbles further, expect WDC to step in to buy more shares at an accelerated pace.WDC ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $5.1 billion.WDC continues to transition to 3D flash technologies through its joint ventures. Although the shift from slower mechanical storage drives to flash-based storage progresses, WDC has exposure to both segments. It launched a massive 12 terabyte capacity storage drive where demand is strong from cloud customers. Use cases for deep learning and analytics are positive demand drivers for 12 TB drives.Western Digital continued to develop its 3D flash technology. It ramped up BiCS3, a 64-layer 3D flash solution and achieved solid manufacturing yields. Management said the yields set new records.Soft demand in mobility is scaring investors. Sales trended lower than management expected during the quarter. It expects no seasonal weakness over the next two quarters but if mobility continues to weaken, the company will offset it with strong capacity enterprise sales.14 analysts covering WDC stock have an average price target of $108.92, implying a whopping upside of 68 percent (source: tipranks). The company received over a dozen analyst reports around two weeks ago. The latest reports come from those with a 5-star tipranks ranking:I would use A5-year DCF Growth Exit model to crunch numbers and to arrive at a fair value.

4192714,81546,2018-07-31T17:14:27-04:00,"Insatiable demand for memory and storage is projected to continue indefinitely.
        I am playing this secular trend by maintaining overweight positions in both Micron and Western Digital.
        Both companies are still viewed as cyclical stocks producing commodity memory and storage products, rather than secular growth stories.
        Stronger for longer financial results and a massive $5 billion buyback (vs. ~$21 billion market cap) of the undervalued stock will eventually catalyze stock price appreciation.
        I rate WDC a buy with a 12-month price target of $100 based on 7X my projected 2019 EPS of $14.20 (NB: company is guiding for $13+).","Stock Selection A couple of my top priority investment themes are:Data Storage: A Massive Secular Growth TrendData storage is one of those long-term secular growth trends that is attractive to me. IDC forecasts in its white paper ""Data Age 2025"" that by 2025 the global datasphere will grow to 163 zettabytes. That total is ten times the quantity of data generated in 2016. A recent Forbes article highlighted the mind-blowing acceleration in the pace of data creation, a trend that is set to continue indefinitely.I am playing this secular data storage trend by maintaining overweight positions in both Micron (MU) and Western Digital (WDC), two stocks that fall under both of the aforementioned categories as they also encompass significant stock buybacks.The two companies compete in the production of NAND (i.e. flash) storage. Western Digital is number two in flash storage and also supplies hard disk drives (HDD) whereas the bulk of Micron’s revenue comes from DRAM. Inexplicably, both these stocks rate among the cheapest on the market despite their prime position to profit from one of the great growth stories.On 7/6/2015 WDC closed at $77.10. Three years later,, on 7/27/18, it closed at $71.10. This was despite approximately tripling its EPS in that time. Why can this growth story not get a bid from the market? For me, it has become a mystery wrapped up inside and enigma. What will it take for this stock to break out?Debunking the WDC Bear CaseThe main pillars of the bear theory are as follows:FY 2018 Financial ResultsWDC just delivered stellar fourth quarter and full year financial results. FY 2018 revenue was $20.6 billion, an increase of 8% Y/Y. Gross margins were up 470 basis points Y/Y resulting from a higher mix of revenue from sales of flash products and capacity enterprise drives. Adjusted net income was $4.5 billion or $14.73 per share, an increase of 60% Y/Y.WDC generated more than $4.2 billion of operating cash flow, an increase of 22% Y/Y. After making capital investments of $1.6 billion, free cash flow totaled $2.7 billion, the majority of which was applied to deleveraging from the high debt taken on to make the SanDisk acquisition.Capital AllocationThe company has previously enunciated the following capital allocation priorities (which I have ordered based on my own perceptions of current priority):Stock BuybacksThe BIG news was the announcement of a new $5 billion share buyback program, of which the company expects to commit $1.5 billion to stock repurchases in the next 12 months. At an average price of $75, that would amount to 20 million shares out of the ~300 million that are currently issued.Lowering the stock count will drive EPS growth. My hope is that the company will front load these buybacks to achieve maximum impact on EPS for the current quarter/year.Deleveraging and Capital Structure / Cost of Capital OptimizationCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $5.1 billion. Total debt principal outstanding decreased by more than $2 billion to $11.2 billion. The net debt position was $6.1 billion.Deleveraging and the successful execution of its debt restructuring strategy, which lowered the effective interest rate on its debt, resulted in a substantial reduction in interest expense.ConclusionFinal note: Thank you for reading this article.

Following the purchase of SanDisk the stock lost some of my attention (as I believed that shares were fully priced at the time), but the current slump warrants a review of the investment thesis.In May of 2016, Western Digital closed the purchase of SanDisk in a massive $19-billion deal. Between the moment of the announcement late in 2015 and actual closure of the deal, shares fell from levels at around $80 per share to just $40 per share. Worries about slower demand and the leveraged balance sheet immediately after the deal was announced made investors rightfully cautious.A reasonable integration process and continued growth made that shares recovered to $90 in the summer of last year, but as shares fell back to $65 at the moment of writing, it is time to revisit the thesis.The tie-up between both firms in 2016 has created a $20-billion data juggernaut, active in client solutions, client devices, data center devices and data center solutions. Of course the promise of the company is that data is being created at an aggressive pace, far outpacing growth in what industry whatsoever, and that just a fraction of this data is stored.New techniques and buzz words such as machine learning and artificial intelligence will only accelerate such trends and hence have the potential to benefit Western Digital, although cheap storage is key in making these technologies come to full fruition.By far the biggest opportunity for the company remains in the more volatile flash market, as the HDD market is stable (for now). After clear progress in the integration process, as the deal closed two years ago, leverage has been reduced in a big way already, and expectations have come down.In the summer of last year, Western Digital reported the first annual results in which both firms were combined for the entire year. The company reported $19.1 billion in sales on which it reported operating earnings of $2.0 billion, while adjusted operating profits were essentially double that amount at $3.9 billion, with adjusted profits pegged at $9.19 per share.Holding $6.4 billion in cash, net debt has been reduced to $6.8 billion in little over a year after which the deal with SanDisk closed. With adjusted EBITDA coming in around $6 billion, it was evident that leverage ratios quickly came down. GAAP earnings were minimal in 2017 on the back of integration expenses as investors were comforted by the thought that adjusted earnings would surpass $12 per share in the fiscal year of 2018.The company grew sales to $20.6 billion this past fiscal year (as reported in July). Operating earnings came in at $2.0 billion, with GAAP earnings amounting to just $397 million, or $1.34 per share, largely lowered on the back of tax reform. Non-GAAP operating earnings rose to $5.4 billion, with adjusted earnings amounting to $4.5 billion.That $14.73 per share number was far stronger than the guidance calling for >$12 per share in earnings power a year ago. The improved earnings power makes that the $6.2 billion net debt load remains very modest, as the company announced a new $5 billion share repurchase program.The earnings number requires a closer look as the gap between GAAP net earnings of $675 million and adjusted earnings of $4.5 billion is very large. The biggest expense is a $1.2 billion impairment charge related to the deal which seems fair to add back. Other true one-time costs in connection to the deal include a $900-million debt extinguishment cost, a $1.1-billion tax adjustment and some other items. Charges which should not be excluded in my view is the $376 million stock-based compensation expense and perhaps a $215 million restructuring expense, as these are quite recurring and dilutive expenses in fast-moving industries. That said, these two items combined come in at just $2 per share ahead of tax, making that a $12.50-13.00 per share earnings number probably looks quite realistic.Note that cash flow is pretty decent as well. The company reports $2.05 billion in D&A charges, of which $1.18 billion relates to amortisation. This shows that regular depreciation charges amount to $870 million. ""Regular"" PP&E investments totalled $809 million last year, but including investments related to Flash Ventures, capital spending totalled $1.55 billion. Net investments of $700 million amount to $2.30 per share, still allowing for >$10 per share in free cash flow power.The problem is more in the outlook. First-quarter sales for the fiscal year of 2019 are seen at $5.15 billion, plus or minus $50 million. Adjusted earnings are seen at $3.05 per share, plus or minus five cents. This makes that sales are seen flat at best versus a $5.2 billion revenue number reported last year, with adjusted earnings seen down from $3.56 per share reported a year before.That is somewhat disappointment given the favourable economic environment and the secular growth story called date. That being said, I just pegged realistic earnings at $12.50-13.00 per share with roughly 80% cash flow conversion. Even if earnings fall 20%, that cash flow number should still be very compelling at $8-9 per share, for just a 7-8 times cash flow multiple, amidst a reasonably resilient balance sheet as well.The concern among investors is that the lower guidance for the current quarter reflects the expectation that the NAND cycle is turning negative and the good times might be over. The good thing is that while the HDD market is flattish, it does provide for some diversification from the more cyclical flash market, something which could or should put a premium on the shares versus pure NAND plays.Unlike Micron (MU) which has reported much quicker revenue growth, is a different business (perhaps better positioned) and posts far higher operating margins, I am attracted to the relative underperforming of Western Digital versus peers in terms of the share price. The lag in the share price has been greater than the operational lower performance, reflective of the expectation that the HDD business will die out over time.While Micron appears to have better prospects and operational performance, the share price has been reflective of that, as I am happy to gradually buy into Western Digital today through some outright purchases and sale of ATM puts."
4193530,101850,2018-08-02T04:03:17-04:00,"Sentiment on WDC down to ""horrific"" lows.The market is too fixated on timing the NAND cycle.Lower NAND ASPs will continue but elasticity could be a source of upside.WDC is also set to gain share from STX on next-gen HDDs.WDC looks compelling for patient investors who can weather the cycle.","This writeup is going to be a fundamental departure from my prior commentary on Western Digital (WDC) as a special situation long (which did not turn out as expected) as I think we are seeing good value now emerge from the stock. WDC recently traded down to 52-week lows, presumably on the EPS guidance cut and NAND cycle concerns.Sentiment was already low coming into the print - one analyst described it as ""horrific"":And he was dead on. Though, I'm personally quite befuddled as to why investors are so fearful of the NAND cycle rolling over. If history has taught investors anything, it's that timing the market is impossible. Naturally, the WDC analysts on the call repeatedly pushed Milligan into helping them time the NAND cycle rather than attempt to assess WDC's through-cycle earnings power.At some points, the call deviated into the ridiculous:I think WDC's decision to push $5bn into buying back its own stock (~24% of mkt cap) says a fair bit about how it thinks it can navigate the cycle. Milligan clearly thinks the stock is cheap now (""We also think that it's a wise use of our capital to repurchase our stock, particularly at these levels"") and is frontloading ~$1.5bn for the first 12 months. That's about as positive a signal as it gets.Despite the ""horrific"" sentiment cited by some analysts, WDC delivered a classic beat for the quarter on sales and EPS. Shipments were up ~31% YoY on an EB basis, with HDD shipments slightly down on softer client and consumer electronics HDDs (offset by stronger Enterprise and Branded HDD shipments) with ASPs also slight down on mix.The flash ASP/ GB was the big mover, declining MSD-HSD % QoQ on softer mobility demand. Notably, this is below Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) reported low-teens % declines, with Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) also citing deceleration. The guidance cut on margins was driven by expected NAND deceleration - gross margins are now set for ~38-39% with EPS at $3.00-3.10. In response, WDC is rationalizing its footprint (shutting down its Malaysian factory) and curtailing capex in 2018.The short-term negatives were enough to drive WDC down to new lows, but the market seemed to have glossed over the long term reset - 1) LT non-GAAP gross margin range is now up to 35-40% (from 33-38% prior) and 2) LT non-GAAP operating margin range is now up to 20-25% (from 18-23% prior). Two key reasons for the higher LT reset - 1) greater mix of higher margin flash revenue and 2) higher mix of capacity enterprise drives.A quick note on guided calendar EPS of $13 - Milligan is still bullish on exceeding the number (""the answer is yes, we will - we're still confident that we'll be able to exceed $13 a share in calendar 2018 EPS"").On valuations - $13 in CY EPS would equate to ~5.4x PE at $70/ share, which just seems excessively pessimistic. Even if EPS were to halve at the trough, this would still be a fairly valued 10-11x PE stock.Value investor or not, I still think it's important to put the analyst hat on and get a handle on what's driving the NAND cycle. To understand why the market is so fearful of memory boom-bust cycles, it helps to revisit the '12-'15 cycle through the eyes of a Korean memory producer. The cycle can be broadly split into three phases - 1) Phase 1 - ASP hikes, 2) sustain profitability on cost reductions, and 3) downturn w/ falling ASP and profitability.I don't think prior cycles are directly comparable to today's however as this NAND cycle is structurally different. Today's end markets are highly diverse (more end markets), elasticity is higher (on SSD adoption), slower bit growth rate (~100+% in '08 vs. 40+% today), and growth constraints (higher fab costs, transition complexity).NAND has clearly entered Phase 3 - commentary out of Samsung indicates shipment growth at ~40% for the industry (Samsung in line) for 2018 with price deceleration predicted across the board. Hynix has even raised capex by ~W2tn (mostly NAND) on its recent call, going against WDC's plan to curtail capex into 2019.Samsung is not holding back either - it raised its 2018 NAND bit supply growth guidance to low-40% yoy from 40% yoy prior. WDC has stated that its cost declines run ~20% YoY so clearly, there's some leeway relative to ASP declines (15-25% LT). But all that supply talk has led to a fair bit of bearish commentary around NAND prospects going into the next few years.Now, I do agree with the theory that we are currently in phase 3 of the cycle, but I do think there's some comfort to be taken from NAND elasticity. Logically, it makes a lot of sense that SSD penetration would rise as NAND ASPs fall, while the adoption of higher density NAND for mobile is also a key driver. Samsung also cited higher SSD adoption in data centres and other high storage applications as potential drivers.Milligan made the right noises on elasticity kicking in for WDC as well, with callouts for smartphones and client SSDs:While the market seems to be completely fixated on NAND supply/ demand dynamics, a separate race is going on in HDDs - and WDC is winning. WDC and Seagate (STX) have diverged in their approaches toward high capacity drives - WDC with Microwave-Assisted Magnetic Recording (MAMR) and STX with Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR).Prior to WDC's announcement last year, the industry had been heading for HAMR approach to scaling above 1.5TB/ sq in. WDC however decided not to pursue HAMR likely on cost and development concerns. The HAMR vs. MAMR debate revolves around scaling potential (HAMR offers potential for higher recording density) vs. production and costs (MAMR production requires less investments).As HAMR utilizes a laser in the write head to prepare the disk for writing, it requires glass disks instead of the typical aluminium ones. This, along with laser unit, adds to costs. MAMR on the other hand uses a microwave field to assist in writing the disk without heat, therefore retaining the ability to use (cheaper) aluminium disks. HAMR BOM costs run ~20% higher than MAMR at volume production.In hindsight, WDC's pivot was a smart one - HAMR development has been pushed out to 2019 on 1) glass substrate shortages and 2) tech difficulties related to the laser (thermal issues). For the foreseeable future, MAMR is a lock on next-gen HDDs as scaling will start near term, while HAMR continues to run into production difficulties.According to WDC, MAMR will help sustain the >10x cost advantage of HDDs over SSDs. WDC has the roadmap to reach >4 Tb/ sq inch (vs STX's 2TB/ sq inch) which will allow WDC to grow HDD capacity by 15% per year while reducing the cost of storage by a similar amount.(Source: WDC)The challenge to WDC's claim of retaining a >10x cost advantage is that it will have to outpace 3D NAND's scaling progress. Optimistic or not, I do think MAMR is a key point against the ""HDD is dead"" bears out there. The MAMR launch in 2019 (test samples in 2018) for data centres will give us more clues on progress. WDC has targeted 40TB/ unit by 2025, with introduction coming in after the 12/ 14TB node.The initial cost advantage and earlier production ramp should see WDC taking a couple of points off Seagate's nearline share.The consensus narrative is that the NAND price downturn is set to continue - and I'd tend to agree with that notion. I'm not entirely sure WDC will re-rate anytime soon if NAND prices remain in the doldrums, but longer term, I think WDC is compelling.I do think however, there's some modest upside near-term to accumulating WDC, but a lot more for longer term, patient investors who can weather the cycle. In fact, I have a feeling WDC's latest GM guide (~38-39%) is intentionally conservative - sensitizing for low 40s % bit supply growth and ~20% ASP decline (mid-point) gets WDC to the 39% mark with a ~23% decline needed to hit 38% GM. With expectations reset down, WDC's $5bn buyback program is opportunistic to say the least.Overall, I'm not sure we've hit peak pessimism on NAND and expect declines to continue into '20. Having said that, a lot of that pessimism has already been priced into the stock, and I do like WDC at these levels.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4191974,25047,2018-07-30T13:01:55-04:00,"At face value, Micron and Western Digital seem to share many characteristics.This includes large businesses acting within existing oligopolies.Both also produce flash memory and sell SSDs.Yet, there are extremely relevant differences between the two, especially taking into account current developments.","Taken at face value, Western Digital (WDC) and Micron (MU) might seem very similar. You could argue that:Yet, these companies are actually very, very different because of the nature of the fears affecting them, and leading to the very low valuations.When it comes to Micron, the fears stem from the DRAM market always having been (and seen) as deeply cyclical. Production capacity additions usually killed the cycle, and the latest fears are that the Chinese are coming for the incredibly juicy and unsustainable margins being enjoyed right now.Have no doubt, the Chinese or someone else will indeed be coming. 50% operating margins don’t last forever when selling a commodity sold on specs. But still, it’s no surprise that the bearish thesis has to revolve around the Chinese or someone else. That happens because when it comes to the current market, this market is divided between three main players in an oligopoly existing since Qimonda went bust and Micron acquired Inotera.Source: Statista.comNow, launching a DRAM business, no matter how juicy the profits are, is slow. It’s slow to build out capable factories and it’s slow to master the technology (and there also can be IP issues).So right now there’s a race between excess capacity coming from third players and the low valuations Micron trades at. There's little doubt that DRAM demand itself will keep on growing, though.Western Digital is very different. HDDs are on the way out. While HDDs have a large advantage in cost per byte stored, they are absolutely a dying technology due to an intrinsic performance disadvantage (both on speed and power consumption). The HDD remaining advantage helps HDDs keep the server market alive and growing, but sooner or later that too will die.This is so because SSDs, on top of being much faster and consuming less power, also are built with NAND memory using semiconductor processes. The semiconductor production processes show a faster rate of development than mechanical processes, and those gains will eventually outstrip HDDs both on capacity and cost.Now, for consumer markets, the SSD speed advantage is so noticeable that the current trend toward HDD death will only accelerate. The only limiting factor is price, and it’s therein that a recent development is set to accelerate the transition massively. Check, for instance, how the price on a Western Digital 500GB PC SSD has been doing:Source: camelcamelcamel.comThat price was cut in half in a single year. And worse still, 500GB is currently more than enough for nearly all consumers. This is even more so today than a few years past, because video is evolving toward being reliant on streaming instead of downloading. Streaming does not require heaps of local storage. Same goes for photos - which are increasingly stored in the cloud. Or even music.As a result of this development, for the overwhelming majority of people, it no longer makes any sense to even buy a laptop or PC with an HDD inside. Only consumer inertia is keeping this market from straight up collapsing to niche status.“But Western Digital also sells SSDs and produces flash memory,” I hear you saying. Indeed it does, but therein lies another problem. This problem can be summed up as follows:Indeed, instead of three major players as in the DRAM market, there are six major players in the NAND market. Unlike DRAM, this will thus be a market exposed to extreme busts, just like DRAM was prior to the current three-player oligopoly. As a matter of fact, we might just be seeing one of those busts. Remember, these cyclical busts can have lows lower than anyone imagines. Lows able to take out capacity through bankruptcies.Source: Statista.comMoreover, an extreme decline in NAND/SSD prices leads to another effect: The acceleration of the HDD demise. That other effect also hurts Western Digital because of its HDD exposure.Finally, when it comes to Western Digital, these developments are taking place now. When it comes to Micron, the developments expected to hit it are in an indefinite future.While they seem in many ways similar, Western Digital and Micron are in two very different situations. Care should be taken when evaluating them as such.For instance, when it comes to Micron, the most important thing is to keep an eye on Chinese developments, which are indeed happening and present risk. As for Western Digital, tracking SSD prices likely gives insight into how fast the HDD consumer business is going to die, how fast HDDs as a whole are going to die, and NAND pricing.In my view, Micron’s risk is actually lower than Western Digital’s. It mostly depends on how fast the Chinese can ramp DRAM production as well as what kind of products they can supply the market with. Right now, the Chinese DRAMs coming on market are of the “slow kind” - however, the Chinese improve very rapidly so they can’t be discounted."
4191652,103480,2018-07-29T03:38:46-04:00,"Western Digital tanked more than 8% after reporting Q4 earnings results, despite beating expectations in the quarter.Investors reacted negatively to a conservative Q1 guidance forecast, though Western Digital has a history of guiding low in the past.Shares are off more than 30% from recent highs above $100.Especially in light of a new $5 billion share repurchase plan, Western Digital shares look extremely cheap.","The bear market rout for Western Digital's (WDC) stock continues in full force, as the dominant memory giant reports Q4 beats but a light Q1 guidance range. Investors can't seem to get behind Western Digital anymore, despite the obvious strengths seen in the company's latest results. Yes, trade tensions are a worry for this China-heavy company and the understated guidance is a subtle warning of that fact - but just how much cheaper can Western Digital get? Western Digital, in my view, is one of the clearest value plays in the technology sector. Its valuation metrics are off-the-charts cheap, even among other low-valued companies in the memory sector like Micron (MU) and Seagate Technologies (STX), especially after a ~30% slide from recent highs above $100 as recently as April. Though shares have retreated out of pure caution for a slowdown, each earnings quarter has proven to be ""better-than-feared."" And perhaps more than most, Western Digital has suffered heavily from the escalation of U.S.-China tensions, even though companies like Micron have gotten hit with actual injunctions from a Chinese court. In my view, it makes little sense to punish a company for circumstances that haven't yet materialized. WDC data by YChartsI have continued to add to my long position and average-cost down as I wait for Western Digital to recover to more normalized valuations. Though it's been a painful ride to endure the sharp losses since April, the company's ~3% dividend yield makes the holding period slightly less penalizing. So far in the Q2 earnings season, plenty of popular technology companies are being hit hard - from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to Netflix (NFLX), as well as Twitter (TWTR). But these are companies that are taking a breather after significant rallies this year - whereas Western Digital has only added to its losses. The future, in my view, is not as bleak for Western Digital as it is for the former few companies, where slowing user/subscriber growth are certain to trigger a slowdown in these companies' top line expansions. Western Digital is far from the pure HDD vendor it used to be - its investments into flash memory provide a high-growth business for the company to build its brand around, and even softening memory prices (which has been a constant topic swirling around Micron in the past month) won't put a huge dent in Western Digital's growth.Western Digital's valuation and recent stock price performance suggests that investors are expecting the worst. In my opinion, we shouldn't count Western Digital out just yet.In the most blatantly obvious signal to the market that Western Digital management thinks shares are undervalued, the company announced a new $5 billion buyback program along with its most recent earnings announcement. We know that a few months back, Micron announced its own $10 billion share buyback program that acted as a major catalyst for the shares in jumping fro the $40 range to the mid-$50s. Last quarter I expected Western Digital, too, to unveil a large-scale buyback program to start consuming its gobs of cash.Though a $5 billion program isn't as sizable as Micron's, Western Digital's buyback program is a larger percentage of the company's current market cap. At today's share price, if Western Digital were to pump in its entire $5 billion in buybacks immediately, it could retire approximately one-quarter of its market cap (versus about 15% for Micron). WDC Market Cap data by YChartsBuybacks could be a major source of EPS growth for Western Digital, even if business fundamentals do slow down in FY19 as the Q1 guidance might suggest. And certainly, Western Digital has the firepower to fund such a large program - it ended Q4 with $5.0 billion of cash on the books, and free cash flow for the full fiscal year clocked in at $3.4 billion, up 19% y/y from FY17. The company could also use its cash flows to cull down its debt, but with a weighted-average interest rate under 3.7% (as shown in the most recent debt schedule below), it makes sense from an ROE perspective to buy back shares at the current low valuation.Figure 1. WDC debtSource: Western Digital investor relationsHere's a look at Western Digital's Q4 results:Figure 2. Western Digital Q4 earningssource: Western Digital investor relationsAt first glance, you wouldn't notice why investors thought this was a bad quarter, or why they think a weak Q1 forecast is believable. Revenues grew 6% y/y to $5.1 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $5.08 billion (+5% y/y) by a hair.Similarly to last quarter, hard drives continued to be a surprising source of strength for revenue growth in the quarter, despite the shift in focus of the business to flash. In fact, softening flash prices is one of the reasons Western Digital offered a lowball forecast for Q1, with CEO Steve Milligan noting the following on the earnings call:Hard drive strength, however, is helping Western Digital to stay afloat, especially on the pricing aspect. Though HDD unit shipments were rather flattish at 39.0 exabytes (like last quarter, softness in consumer notebook and desktop memory was balanced by strong demand for enterprise drives), average selling prices for HDDs increased to $70, up more than 10% from $63 in 4Q17.Though Western Digital's gross margin still dipped 30bps on a year-over-year basis, this strength in HDD pricing was effectively able to soften the blow from weaker flash pricing. As can be seen in the table above as well, Western Digital managed to keep a tight check on operating expenses, which were flat year-over-year due to a slight cutback in research and development spending. Operating income, as a result, saw a 29% y/y jump to $843 million in the quarter, while a favorable tax impact caused a near-tripling of net income to $756 million. Pro forma EPS of $3.61 crushed Wall Street's estimates to $3.50, and as previously mentioned, free cash flow of $3.4 billion for the year grew 19% y/y. With healthy results in Q4 that beat Wall Street's expectations by a respectable margin, it's too soon to write off Western Digital as a sure failure in FY19, despite a weak Q1 guidance range (see below):Source: Western Digital investor relationsWestern Digital's revenue guidance of $5.1-$5.2 billion (versus analyst estimate of $5.4 billion) represents flat revenues from 1Q18's $5.18 billion. While it's true that the fear of softening flash prices may be driving this assumption, the bulk of Western Digital's business is still centered in HDDs, a segment that has seen surprising (if unexciting) stability over the past few quarters. And even if top-line growth does slow down, Western Digital has shown tremendous cost discipline that has allowed it to produce double-digit operating income growth in spite of mid-single-digit revenue growth. Though being a bull on Western Digital might be a contrarian position in an investment climate that is cooling toward memory stocks, I'm sticking with this company for the long haul."
4204461,104514,2018-09-06T09:29:18-04:00,"Shares have plummeted 44% off of their 52 week high in mid-March.I believe worries about commoditized pricing pressure are overblown, much like they were in 2015 and 2016.Balance sheet is improving, as WDC has reduced and restructured debt.Dividends and share buybacks present a margin of safety to a longer term investor.","Readers of past articles are familiar with my favorite characteristics for a stock to buy, which are deep-value, contrarian, dividend-paying stocks. I believe that forecasting the future is incredibly difficult, so we can succeed at a higher rate by buying companies that have a good track record and have dropped for less-than-compelling reasons.I find the present market oddly devoid of such stocks, whereas only a few months ago there were many such value targets to be found. One outlier to this notion is Western Digital Corporation (WDC). I believe that shares are presently a bargain and may possibly go lower in the meantime, but have a good chance to recover over the long-term.On 9/4/18 I purchased 50 shares at $59.05 in my Roth IRA as part of my buy-and-hold long-term holdings plan. I will reinvest the dividends so long as shares appear massively undervalued.Image from finviz.comWestern Digital has plummeted ~44% from 52-week highs in mid-March, which looks downright catastrophic. This is the type of share price movement that signals major problems with the company.The main culprit? Declining prices for NAND flash has caused panic that we are going to experience another cyclical downturn which spells doom for all companies involved in the commoditized product.Image taken from flashbay.comThis pricing pressure will obviously affect WDC’s bottom-line, but to what extent? On the most recent earnings call, management guided for FQ1 19 EPS of $3.00 to $3.10, a ~15% decline YoY from FQ1 18 and 16% off of their most recent earnings.Image taken from WDC investor presentation 7/26/18I encourage readers to note that margins still remain a very healthy 38-39% overall (some people think this is a conservative estimate), and while that is not quite as high as a company like Micron (MU) with an approximate 56% profit margin, it still beats other storage companies like Seagate (STX) with a 29.6% margin. In fact, Micron’s storage product margin is only around 14%, which is comparing apples to apples.As you can see from the stock price chart below of WDC and STX, it appears that we are truly in a cyclical downturn. The question remains though, how closely will this pricing pressure in 2018 and 2019 mirror that of 2015 and 2016?Image from Yahoo FinanceFrom the beginning of 2015, at the top of the last cycle to the bottom in the summer of 2016, WDC’s earnings per share declined from $2.26 to $0.79 (-66%) and revenue dropped from $3.9 billion to $3.49 billion (-11%). Shares went from about $113 to under $36, or -69% in that time span. Wise investors at that bottom would have nearly tripled their investment in the following two years.Fast forward to today, where we have already experienced a 44% drop in share price on a current 9% drop in earnings (from the top of 2018), and a further future predicted drop of 15% for next quarter. In other words, investors have already bailed on the sector because they think that this pain will continue. While certainly possible, WDC trades for a ridiculous valuation. If management proves accurate in their guidance, WDC is presently changing hands for a 4.9x forwards P/E.Image taken from WDC investor presentation 7/26/18Western Digital was quite universally chastised for their debt-heavy purchase of SanDisk a few years ago, and financial weakness is a common concern here on the Seeking Alpha comment boards. In FY 2018, WDC addressed this issue by not only reducing overall debt by 2.8 billion, but by improving their interest expense by retiring and restructuring expensive debt.Image taken from company 10-K issued 8/24/18Having their debt at much lower interest rates has approximately halved the amount of interest expense WDC pays per quarter, down to about $100 million. I think that this was a prudent use of cash, and will help make up for the current and future pricing weakness. Strengthening the balance sheet heading into a market downturn is smart.WDC also announced a new $5B share repurchase program to replace the old one, and this $5B represents ~28% of the current float. As you can see below, past share repurchases have ended up being detrimental due to purchasing at far above today’s price.

4186741,69905,2018-07-11T19:52:51-04:00,Western Digital's stock is undervalued.A discussion of Western Digital's cash commitments to Toshiba.Investors' fears over the sector's cyclicality are overblown.,"Western Digital (WDC) is cheaply valued. Although there is one blemish on Western's financials which I'll touch on in the article, overall there is minimal reason for such apathy towards this data storage solutions company. Further, Western Digital and its peers will ultimately be the foundation that will allow the data revolution to take place. Many investors are concerned by the cyclicality of the sector. Right away, from following the tech space very closely I would disagree with these overarching concerns. There are in fact strong secular tailwinds in the cloud sector and other data center companies with large requirements for storage solutions.The second concern which many investors have is that these companies are largely commodity-like companies, with no real competitive advantage. Which I would tend to agree on. However, my argument here would be, if you mine for lithium and lithium is in very high demand, then it makes little difference whether the mineral is a commodity, because as long as demand remains high there is little to be concerned about. Presently investors are so fearful of the potential cyclicality of this sector that they are leaving meaningful returns on the table.Over time, I have found that buying businesses with high free cash flow margins (defined as FCF/Revenue expressed as a percentage), offers investors protection against downturns. Specifically, a cyclical company which sells a high margin product can afford to take a hit on its price (say a 30% discount) and still remain profitable during a sector's downturn. How does this apply to Western Digital? Roughly, we can see that Western Digital generates $2 billion in free cash flow and approximately $15.5 billion in revenue (both figures are normalized). This would imply Western Digital has a free cash flow margin of approximately 13%. Which means, that if the investor is wrong, and Western Digital is indeed headed for a sector contraction, then Western Digital would be able to weather the downturn relatively well. Accordingly, in an attempt to allay investors' concerns, CEO Milligan mentioned during its Q3 2018 earnings call that Western Digital remains focused on capitalizing on secular growth in Big Data and Fast Data applications and that hyperscale cloud customers continue to deploy large sums of capital to keep pace with the rapid growth in data centers. Also, Milligan mentioned how the joint venture (with Toshiba Memory Corp. (TOSYY)) continues to perform exceptionally well. In the introduction, I mentioned that there was a blemish in Western Digital's financials. And that is if I'm wrong, and the market's concern about its upcoming industry contraction is an actuality, and we are now operating at the peak of the market, I would not be overly happy to be invested in Western Digital with its unwieldy balance sheet. More specifically, Western Digital's contractual obligations and commitments add up to $27 billion.Of course, shareholders would immediately counter this by highlighting that a large portion of this $27 billion figure comes from Western Digital's commitment to its Flash Ventures joint venture with Toshiba Memory Corp. (roughly $9 billion) - which is true, but nevertheless, that is still a drag on Western Digital's cash output. Offsetting these cash commitments is Western Digital's cash balance of $5 billion, leaving Western Digital with a net debt position of $22 billion - which is not great for a company which generates close to $2 billion in free cash flow per year. On the other hand, in spite of my concerns regarding Western Digital's less-than-optimal balance sheet, I feel that my concerns are fully put to rest, as this concern and many others are already accounted for by its present valuation.Source: author's calculations, morningstar.comNote, in the interest of disclosure, I wish to highlight that I am a Micron Technologies (MU) shareholder.  Thus, as much as I try to be objective in my assessment of Western Digital there could be some unknown cognitive-bias creeping into my valuation of Western Digital. Moving on, the table above shows that with the exception of NetApp (NTAP) the rest of its peers' cash flows are being quite lowly valued - although I would argue that NetApp is now fully priced and in the event of a sector correction, this stock would be the most punished. Furthermore, SA readers familiar with my work will know my focus on a company's P/Sales ratio, as I believe that the P/Sales ratio is nicely reflective of investors' sentiment towards a stock and useful for cutting through much PR spin. Here once more, we can see how the rest of its peers are all trading with inflated P/Sales ratio relative to their own historical averages, while Western Digital's P/Sales ratio is firmly in line with its 5-year average and trading for approximately half of its peers' P/Sales ratio.Western Digital and its peers are unjustifiably out of favor with the investment community. I believe that patient investors getting in now, and willing to fully disregard the vicissitudes in Western Digital's share price over the next few quarters, will be pleasantly rewarded within 2-3 years, once positive investors' sentiment returns to the sector.

4183944,103480,2018-06-26T06:27:56-04:00,"Western Digital's shares have entered a bear market, having fallen more than 25% from a recent peak above $100.While China-related headlines pose some risk, they are largely a distraction from the strength of Western Digital's underlying business.Read-through from Micron's recent quarterly results was extremely positive, with NAND and DRAM pricing pointing to stabilization.Western Digital remains perennially undervalued at 5.5x forward P/E. Shares are also offering a 2.6% yield for patient investors.","After assuming the crown of top-performing sector over the past several years, it's only natural that the technology sector took the brunt of the beating on the China trade war-fueled selloff. With most high-flying names falling in the range of 5% or more, bargains suddenly abound again in the sector.One name that has been a bargain for several months - and after the recent extended selloff, is even more of a bargain - is Western Digital (WDC). It's no secret, of course, that memory chip stocks have been among the most undervalued stocks of the past few years as investors have feared the end of the cyclical upswing in the memory industry. At the beginning of the year, industry analysts were expecting memory prices to fall off a cliff in the back half of 2018. Recent data points, including Micron's (NASDAQ:MU) recent earnings release, however, challenge those bearish assumptions.Regardless, memory stocks continue to shed gains. In last month's brutal correction, Western Digital has been among the hardest hit. The China-driven selloff has erased Western Digital's gains for the year, and since the beginning of December, Western Digital has shed -2% (hugely underperforming the broader tech sector, which even after the recent selloff is up nearly 10%). From the company's peak in March, shares have lost more than 25%.WDC data by YChartsIt would be naively optimistic to declare that the pain will be over quickly. Memory stocks have a long history of being volatile names, and for Western Digital in particular, shares may see even further pressure until Q4 earnings, due in mid-July. Regardless, given the strength in the company's earnings growth and cash flow (in the year to date period, Western Digital has achieved 34% y/y operating cash flow growth - how much more robust can a ""legacy"" hardware's cash flow results be?), it's best to hold on and use dips to continue building a position. I've taken advantage of the recent pullback to add to my holdings at a lower average cost.In the long run, a stock trading at under 5.5x forward P/E is simply unsustainable. There's evidence coming out of Micron's most recent earnings to suggest that memory stocks will be much less cyclical now than in the past, hopefully allowing companies like Western Digital to shed the cyclicality discounts on their valuation.Though it may take months or even several quarters for Western Digital to regain the >$100 handle (though shares did rally quickly to $105 in March within less than two weeks of trading in the $80 range, which is where it's trading now), Western Digital also now sports a respectable yield that can tide over investors while they wait for a valuation recovery.Western Digital is currently yielding $0.50 per quarter, or $2.00 per year. At current share prices, this represents a yield of 2.6%, much more than the typical technology stock and certainly more than memory peer Micron. In the past five years, Western Digital has kept a stable dividend and has doubled its payout since 2013:Figure 1. Western Digital dividend historySource: NASDAQWestern Digital's earnings and cash flow growth, largely powered by Trump's corporate tax reform, also leaves open the door to a dividend hike or a significantly expanded buyback program. Micron recently announced a brand new, $10 billion buyback program that can single-handedly produce 16% inorganic EPS growth. Given Western Digital has about $5 billion of cash on the books and ~$3 billion in annual FCF, it could mount a similarly-sized program. Over the past year, much of Western Digital's investment has been focused on getting its foot in the door with NAND production, but with the Toshiba deal sealed, Western Digital may be looking toward shareholder returns in spending its considerable cash intake.In general, chip stocks tend to rise and fall as a group: what benefits or harms one stock generally cascades down to the rest of the group. Just a few weeks ago, we received an extremely strong quarterly read from Micron's Q3 results, pointing to similar strength when Western Digital reports results next month.The key points from Micron's quarter, in my view, were not company-specific. The most salient takeaway was that Micron managed to achieve a sequential lift in NAND and DRAM pricing - quite contrary to the bearish opinion that memory prices were headed for a steep drop-off this year. While Micron doesn't give exact ASP figures or growth rates, it pointed to ""mid-to-upper single digit"" growth rates on a quarter-over-quarter basis for both DRAM and NAND. It would be plausible to assume that Western Digital was able to benefit from the same pricing tailwinds as Micron, though magnitudes may differ.The other positive note was that, for both Western Digital and Micron as well as other memory stocks, a lot of growth is being driven by end-customer diversification. Cloud computing, in particular, has driven massive double-digit growth in bit shipments, helping to stave off price decay and memory supply and OEM capacity begin to pick up this year.In Western Digital's most recent quarter, its largest historical segment - client devices, or embedded memory chips in devices such as PCs - saw flat y/y growth, while detached hard drives and flash drives as well as cloud computing units saw tremendous growth, as shown in the chart below:Figure 2. Western Digital Q3 revenue growth by end-customer segmentSource: Western Digital investor relationsWe've already seen, from HP's (HPQ) most recent earnings quarter, that the stagnant PC/desktop market is starting to show signs of life again. While this will provide a boost to Western Digital's shipments, it's also no longer as dependent on PCs and memory-embedded hardware to drive its business. In the past, client devices represented about half of Western Digital's revenues; now, it's slightly less than half.Diversification in Western Digital's customer base, particularly from the hot cloud market, will continue to protect elevated prices in the memory market. In addition, less dependence on PC shipments as well as a healthy demand environment that keeps up with growing supply helps to ensure that Western Digital's peaks and valleys may be less exaggerated this time around than in the previous cycle.In my view, the market is being overly bearish on Western Digital. In the year to date, Western Digital has driven tremendous earnings and cash flow growth, driven not just by tax reform but also by strength in memory pricing and robust end-customer demand that is now diversified across a broader mix of use cases. Micron's most recent quarterly post corroborates the thesis that fundamentals in the memory market have never been brighter, and Western Digital also stands to benefit.Even if Western Digital takes some more time to get back into its groove, it's currently offering investors a juicy yield just shy of 3%, far more than most technology stocks offer. With such a lowball valuation that over exaggerates how cyclical Western Digital's business really is, the stock has tremendous upside potential - even doubling the current share price would put Western Digital at a below-market average P/E ratio. In my view, investors are best staying along for the ride and collecting dividends while they wait."
4172828,102404,2018-05-11T10:07:22-04:00,"Although there are many explanations why Western Digital Corporation cannot continue its upward trend, technical analysis might provide the simple answer.Fundamental risks are the high interest rates and maybe the debt levels as well as Western Digital being a cyclical company.But megatrends like artificial intelligence, the Internet of things and the resulting growing demand for storage capacity should ensure at least moderate growth for Western Digital.Western Digital is still undervalued and currently oversold and hence a clear buy at current prices.","Western Digital Corporation (NYSE: WDC) has been beating expectations on a regular basis in the last quarters (for a nice overview click here). Although revenue was only about 1% higher in most quarters, the reported EPS could exceed expectations more than just a few cents. In the last quarters, the reported EPS was almost 10% higher than analysts' expectations, yet the stock declined after earnings. Taking the non-GAAP EPS of the last four quarters ($14.07) we get a P/E ratio of 5.5 and therefore one question begs for an answer: Why is Western Digital still valued at such low multiples (as it trades at such ratios for quite some time)? But not just the P/E is ridiculously low (compared to the US stock market), the P/Bv ratio (about 2) is also very unusual for a tech company.To understand if Western Digital is really undervalued or if the depressed multiples are justified, we will look at different aspects. On the one hand, there are some risks and uncertainties surrounding the company, but we can also look at positive underlying trends that should ensure growth in the years to come. We will also try to calculate the intrinsic value of the company, but first we will start this time with some technical analysis and in order to understand a little better why Western Digital has mostly been moving sideways in the last months (despite beating expectations) we first have to look at the monthly and weekly charts.If we look at the chart of the last 25 years, we can see that Western Digital Corporation climbed during the 90s (no surprise, all tech companies did!) and reached its temporary high in 1997. It took 16 years - till 2013 - before the stock could break out over the orange line and generate new highs after the 16-year long correction. In 2016 we saw the pullback on the orange trendline as well as the 200-month exponential moving average - a great entry point by the way, as Western Digital was extremely undervalued at that point. Following the pullback, we first saw Western Digital almost triple in value within a few months and after that the correction we are still in right now.(Source: TraderFox Trading-Desk - 8.000 Aktien und Realtimekurse weltweit in Echtzeit!)To understand why the stock was moving sideways in the last few months despite Western Digital beating expectations every quarter and reporting very solid numbers, a closer look at the chart might help. Since the lows of $35, the stock almost tripled within a few months and after such a rally it is not unusual that a stock will be in a corrective phase a little longer. This is simple how markets behave - an impulsive (upward) wave is always followed by a corrective wave (and the fact that we are only seeing a sideward corrective phase can be a hint for the strong underlying trend). When switching to the weekly chart, we can see the correction pattern more clearly. More or less, we have a descending triangle with an outbreak on the upper side a few weeks ago (breakout through the blue dotted trendline). But as we know now, the breakout was not successful because what looked like a pullback to the dotted blue line at first - and should have been followed by a climbing stock price - is now a failed breakout and we are inside the correction pattern once again.(Source: TraderFox Trading-Desk - 8.000 Aktien und Realtimekurse weltweit in Echtzeit!)We mentioned above, that a sideward correction is a positive sign - the failed breakout however could be a hint for disaster as a failed breakout is sometimes followed by a stepper correction in the opposite direction. However, I think we have a good support level at about $75 as there are the former lows as well as the 200-week exponential moving average. At some point in time, the upward trend will continue and the correction pattern will be finished - at least when the stock is still undervalued and that is the question we will focus on in the next sections. We never look solely at technical analysis to decide if a stock is a good investment or not - fundamental aspects are more important.As the stock is currently declining and the sentiments seems to be rather negative, let's look at the risks and bearish arguments first. When searching for reasons, why Western Digital couldn't continue its upward trend so far, we usually hear the same arguments. One of them was the dispute with Toshiba, which seemed to be lasting forever and was an often-quoted argument why the stock didn't climb higher. In my last article I also wrote about the dispute and called it a risk and an uncertainty that was a burden on the stock price. But the dispute seems solved right now and is therefore no longer a risk the investor has to consider.A second, often-mentioned risk are the high debt levels. It is true that Western Digital took on quite some debt when it acquired SanDisk for $19 billion in 2016 and the interest rates are rather high. But to be honest, Western Digital's debt isn't that high and definitely manageable. Right now, Western Digital has about $11.1 billion in long-term debt and therefore a D/E ratio of a little below 1.0 which is acceptable. But we also have to point out the $5 billion in cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet - leaving WDC with only $6 billion of missing cash to repay the debt. We also have to consider that WDC generated almost $1 billion in operating income in the last quarters and it would therefore take only about 2 years of operating income to repay the debt.A third risk for the entire data storage industry is the cyclicality, which is one of the crucial dynamics. As we are not talking about essential products, customers are buying SDDs not out of necessity, but rather for entertainment. A logical consequence is, that the purchase can easily be postponed in times of economic downturns. And especially if chipmakers and data storage companies think that demand will be stable over a long period of time, these companies spend billions on additional capacity and when demand declines and customers don't order any more, the high product capacities make the price drop rapidly.These are all reasons one can read on a regular basis when discussing why the stock couldn't continue its bullish trend. But in my opinion, it is mostly a technical reason - the bullish upward wave before has to be corrected and when that corrective wave is finish, the stock will continue to climb higher.Despite all the risks and uncertainties surrounding Western Digital - and as mentioned in the section above, these risks shouldn't trouble investors too much - there are positive underlying trends for Western Digital. On the last earnings call, Steve Milligan talked about the long-term strategy:In my first article about Western Digital I also wrote about the positive underlying trends. People take pictures, create videos, want to stream movies and series and companies are collecting data about customers and these are only a few examples why more storage capacity is needed. The biggest driver of revenue growth might be the internet of things leading to the fact that many items we know will communicate and start collecting data - our cars, the refrigerator, wristbands people wear and so on. But of course we have the above-mentioned cyclicality to keep in mind.For Western Digital alone, the number of exabytes shipped has been growing more than 33% YoY and supports the thesis that much more digital storage capacity is needed in the years to come. The biggest growth in revenue came from ""data center devices and solutions"". Compared to the year before, revenue grew 25% in the last quarter. But revenue and free cash flow growth alone is no reason to invest in a company - we also have to look at its intrinsic value.In many articles about Western Digital, authors, contributors and commentators mention the extremely cheap valuation of Western Digital, but WDC has only a low P/E ratio if you use non-GAAP numbers. According to US GAAP, Western Digital could only report $61 million in net income ($0.20 EPS) in the last quarter instead of $1,117 million ($3.63 EPS) on a non-GAAP basis. The huge difference mostly stems from $894 million in ""debt extinguishment costs"". I will not argue for or against GAAP accounting standard but will only point out that investors should not just pick the number they like (in case of bulls, the non-GAAP number) because it proofs their (bullish) point.(Source: Western Digital Corporation Press Release)In the end, I won't pay too much attention to GAAP or non-GAAP net income, because what counts is the free cash flow a company can generate now and in the future. If we use the average free cash flow of the last ten years ($1,624 million) and assume that Western Digital will only be able to grow about 3% for eternity, we get an intrinsic value of $74.79 for the stock (assuming a 10% discount rate). Taking these numbers, the stock would be fairly valued right now. But we have to ask ourselves if the growth rate is accurate and also if we should use the average free cash flow of the last ten years.Looking at the different numbers, we see a clear buoyancy not just for the stock price, but also for the company's revenue and the free cash flow. The cap spending has been between $500 and $800 million for most years (with one exception where it came close to $1 billion) and hence assuming a CAPEX of $750 million on average for the next years is very realistic. As the free cash flow is the cash flow from operations minus CAPEX, we also have to examine the expected cash flow from operations for the future. A net cash provided from operations over $4 billion (as in the last four quarters) is certainly too optimistic as number for our calculations especially with depreciation and amortization being much higher than in the years before. But I think it is realistic to assume up to $3 billion operating cash flow and take about $2 billion free cash flow as basis for our calculation - and this is very conservative in my opinion. Using those number in our intrinsic value calculation from above, the fair value of WDC would be $92.10.The second important question is if a growth rate of 3% is realistic for Western Digital for the years to come. Keeping in mind that we are dealing with a cyclical industry that will have phases of boom and bust a too optimistic average growth rate might be unrealistic, but considering the underlying trends mentioned above, I think we can use 4% or 5% as realistic growth rate. To be conservative once again, let's say 4% annual growth for Western Digital. Using the $2 billion free cash flow and 4% growth, we get an intrinsic value of $108.70. Keeping in mind that this calculation is still conservative, WDC is definitely undervalued right now and a good pick at current prices.Of course, we don't have a similar buying opportunity right now as we had back in 2016 when the stock dipped briefly under $40. But with a dividend yield of currently 2.6% the stock could also be interesting for dividend investors and although I applaud Western Digital's decision to keep the dividend stable and reduce the debt levels first, the company has at least the possibility of increasing the dividend in the years to come. And finally - although this is rather a short-term argument - the stock is oversold right now as it dropped from $105 to $77 within a few weeks and the decline should stop at this point. Western Digital is at a very similar price level as it was when I published my last article Western Digital: Buy the dip and the advice is the same as back then: Buy the dip, because the stock is supported from a technical point of view and is also undervalued right now."

Western Digital's effective tax rate will be between 5%-7%, resulting in non-GAAP EPS at between $3.40-$3.50. As a result, revenue growth for fiscal 2018 will exceed management's prior guidance, and margins (which were forecast to be below 38%) will now exceed 40% for the remainder of calendar 2018.This strong performance leaves Western Digital's record low valuation as an opportunity for value investors to buy at record lows.Western Digital's chart also presents a strong argument for buying, as its price currently sits in a strong demand zone, which coincides with the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level:(Source: TradingView Charts/My own Technical Analysis)Although sellers have been in control since March and have successfully pushed price below the 200-day MA (generally a strong bear signal), the strong confluence of technical support levels near WDC's current price, combined with the stocks current low valuation on fundamental metrics, should limit downside, and provides a strong entry point for long-term investors.Revenue for the March quarter was $5 billion, increasing 8% y/y. Datacenter Devices and Solutions revenue increased 25% y/y to $1.7 billion, primarily due to strong demand for capacity enterprise hard drives.

This included product development investments, improvements in go-to-market capabilities and IT transformation projects. An additional $157 million of interest expense for the March quarter will lower the effective interest rate on Western Digital's debt.

A CAGR of 19 percent over the next three years is below my ~ 22 percent EPS growth expectation over the next five years.

4141513,67473,2018-01-31T02:40:22-05:00,"Includes detailed analysis of Hazelton Capital's positions in SAVE, WDC, MU and USAT.","Dear Partner,Hazelton Capital Partners, LLC (the ""Fund"") gained 6.4% from October 1, 2017, through, December 31, 2017, gained 23.6% year-to-date and has returned 128% since its inception in August 2009. By comparison, the S&P 500 gained 6.6% in the same quarter, increased 21.8% year-to-date and has returned 206% since the Fund's inception.Hazelton Capital Partners ended the 4th quarter with a portfolio of 18 equity positions and a cash level equivalent to 27% of assets under management. The Fund's top five portfolio holdings, which are equal to slightly below 40% of the Fund's net assets, are Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), USA Technologies (OTCPK:USAT), Ezcorp (NASDAQ:EZPW), and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE). Similar to previous quarters in 2017, Hazelton Capital Partners continued to prune many of its top holdings, but unlike past quarters, the Fund was able to find two new investments to re-deploy some of its cash. One of those investments was in Hanesbrands (NYSE:HBI) which I presented at this year's MOI Best Ideas Conference.Micron Technologies & Western Digital are the largest and second-largest holdings in the portfolio, respectively. The Fund has not reduced its investment in either company, as I believe the overall memory and storage industry will continue to benefit from increased demand in DRAM, NAND, and HDD. Historically, the memory and storage industry has been very cyclical, driven by the demand for market share rather than return on invested capital. This behavior, along with quick technology innovations, led to a rapid decline in the average selling price (ASP) per unit. As I have stated before, cyclicality will continue to play a role in the memory and storage industry, but I expect the duration of the cycle will get longer and the peak to trough pricing will be less rapid and less dramatic. The market appears to be pricing in lower NAND and DRAM ASPs. My expectation is that declining ASPs will be met by an even greater reduction in unit costs, allowing memory and storage companies to improve their gross and operating margins.During the 4th quarter, Western Digital settled its ongoing dispute with its JV partner, Toshiba (TMC). Like most corporate disagreements that become litigious, both sides mishandled the situation, became inflexible, claimed a ""win-win"" settlement, but in reality, lost as much as they gained from the exercise. The settlement does extend the JV agreement between Toshiba and Western Digital through 2029, including existing and future fabrication plants. However, by agreeing to the settlement, Western Digital consented to the sale of Toshiba's portion of the JV to a consortium led by Bain Capital (which includes rivals SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) (OTC:HXSCL), and Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX)), the primary reason behind Western Digital's litigation to block the sale. With months of uncertainty taking a toll on WDC's share price, the markets' reaction to the settlement has been muted. Western Digital's latest EPS guidance for fiscal 2018 is $13.75/share as it continues to see market demand for its enterprise HDD and SSD offerings. At its current share price, this equates to less than 6.5x earnings.The largest contributors to the Hazelton Capital Partners' performance was USA Technologies. In the 3rd and 4th quarters, Hazelton Capital Partners trimmed some of its USAT position, believing that the share price had gotten a bit ahead of the company's fundamentals. We expect that USAT future valuation prospects will continue to flourish as the company continues to expand its vending machine point-of-sale platform both through organic and recent acquisition growth. In the meantime, the Fund is ready to repurchase shares if the opportunity presents itself.Spirit Airline was one of only a few investments that contributed negatively to the portfolio for the year. In mid-summer, shares of the discount carrier fell as United Airlines increased the number of ""basic economy"" seats on its regional flights from its hubs in New Jersey and Chicago. These ""basic economy"" fares compete directly with Spirit Airlines and the news drove down SAVE's share price by 38% in a matter of 2 months. It is important to understand that even though United, Delta, American, and Southwest all operate airlines, their business models are completely different than Spirits. Spirit Airlines makes its money by selling low fare seats while up charging for amenities, and then offsetting those revenues with even cheaper expenses. The other domestic carriers make their profits from baggage fees and selling airline miles to credit card companies; the flight is just a means to the end. Low oil prices give the major airlines the flexibility to offer ""basic economy"" seats, but when oil prices rise, it will make competition with the low-cost carriers less attractive.""Play your game. Play your game. Play Your Game."" - Herb BrooksWith the winter Olympics less than two weeks away, the vivid memory of the 1980 US Men's Hockey Team's unimaginable defeat of the then Soviet Union is once again conjured up. On paper, there was no probable way that a team of US college athletes could defeat the Soviet National Hockey Team made up of full-time athletes (professionals). Instead of trying to match up to the Soviets, Herb Brooks (1980 US Olympic Men's Hockey Coach) decided his only competitive advantage would be to produce the best-conditioned athletes - out-skating their opponents. His strategy worked. Throughout the Olympics, the US Hockey Team outscored its opponents 27-6 in the second and third periods. In the pivotal game against the Soviet Union, the months of training paid off as Mike Eruzione's goal with 10 minutes left to play in the game gave the US a 4 to 3 lead and the eventual win. Not accustomed to taking the lead with so much time left on the clock, Brooks kept reminding his players to ""Play your game.""It is said that ""a rising tide lifts all boats,"" and given the recent strength of the US stock market, the passage of the US corporate tax cut appears to be that rising tide. A lower corporate tax rate is expected to add meaningfully to a company's bottom line while making the repatriation of the trillions of dollars held outside the US very affordable. In skilled hands, additional cash can be a significant competitive advantage for a corporation, creating value for both the company and its shareholders. But all too often, excess cash is given to an undisciplined and irresponsible management with the need to justify its existence. In the short run, a company's value may appear to strengthen along with its earnings and the promise of accretive acquisitions, but eventually, the frivolous spending and incompetence will take its toll on the company's future value. Hazelton Capital Partners recognizes the impact the recent US corporate tax cut has had on the equity market but remains steadfast to its investment process. We temper the ""fear of missing out"" with the ""fear of acting rashly."" Revenue growth, operational efficiency, and a skilled management are the foundation on which sustainable and valuable companies are built. The Fund stands ready to invest its cash in companies that meet these criteria regardless of market conditions. Even with all the recent frenzy and hysteria, we intend to ""Play our game.""I recently contributed an article to Kate Welling's thoughtful publication, Welling on Wall Street (WOWS), entitled ""The 'Next Big Thing' - It Just Might Be Hidden in Plain Sight."" In the article, I posed the following Question: What is going to be the most dramatic change in our society over the next 10 years and which company is going to benefit from this ""next big thing?"" Many investing strategies focus on the search for the ""next big thing""- The company or asset that is not only going to disrupt an industry's status quo but leave an improved and streamlined business model in its wake. These are ""story stocks,"" a company whose share price is based on the narrative of its expected future potential, rather than current earnings or assets. There are a number of very successful investors who use this strategy; I am not one of them.Numerous variables and unknowns need to be considered for a company to not only be sustainable but profitable: Is the industry growing and are margins healthy? Are the barriers to entry significant enough to keep ""outsiders"" at bay? Will industry members act rationally? Just as important is the company's management team which plays a significant role in its success: Does management have a laser-like focus on execution? Is it able to pivot from setbacks and react to direct attacks on its business model? Of course, during this time, a healthy portion of luck also contributes to the company's fortunes. Maybe a better approach to investing in the ""next big thing"" is to invert the question: What is not going to change over the next 10 years and which company will benefit? Even though uncertainty has not been completely eliminated, this is a much easier question to answer.In 2006, I invested in Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), a 150-year-old paint and coating company. My investing thesis was very straightforward: As a global manufacturer and distributor of architecture paints and industrial coatings, Sherwin Williams, its brand and its industry would continue to grow steadily even through routine market cycles - Perhaps not the double-digit growth that many in the market had come to expect and covet, but steady and predictable growth nonetheless. Additionally, given Sherwin Williams assets, its well-known brand and market share, there was very little risk of a newcomer or technology disrupting this industry. By 2011, even as the market continued to recover, I decided to sell my SHW position. There was nothing inherently wrong with the company or the industry and my return was positive, slightly over 75%. The reason I eliminated the position was because I grew impatient and that impatience led me to question how this company was going to continue to grow in value when its revenue was only growing by 5-7% annualized. Looking back at that investment and my decision to sell it, I came to realize that I did not truly understand the company. Let me be clear. I was completely confident in my research, analysis, and valuation of the company and its financials. But what I did not take the time to contemplate was how Sherwin Williams' management would impact the value of the company over a 10-year period. I failed to appreciate that when a strong cash generating company encounters a management team focused on generating value for the company and its shareholders, this creates a powerful and disruptive force. This turned out to be a very costly lesson.If I had held my Sherwin Williams position for a ten-year period from the time I purchased it in 2006, the share price would have appreciated over 680%. That 680% return included: $2 billion in dividends paid to its shareholders, $5 billion spent on reducing its share count by 30%, an EPS that tripled, and a P/E multiple that doubled from 12x to over 25x. In fact, if I had continued to hold Sherwin Williams shares until the end of 2017 (an additional 16 months), the return would be closing in on a 1000% return, the elusive ""10 bagger.""Sherwin Williams is an ""anti-story"" stock, operating in an unexciting, overlooked segment of our economy that attracts little to no attention. With the news media's insatiable appetite for reporting on the ""next big thing,"" it is easy to see how investors can become preoccupied and overlook a high caliber company like Sherwin Williams. Some of the best long-term investments are often cloaked because they do not fit within a particular investing ""style."" They trade at too high a multiple or with too much debt to be considered a value stock, and their revenue growth rates have long since returned from the stratosphere to a more mundane but sustainable level. The lessons learned from my impatience and short-sightedness have helped shape future investments including Hanesbrands which I recently presented at the MOI Best Ideas Conference. The presentation focuses on similarities between Hanesbrands today and Sherwin Williams 10 to 12 years ago.Although some treat investing as a competition, it is not an Olympic sport. An investor does not get extra points for his willingness to buy shares of a highly volatile ""story stock."" For those addicted to the adrenaline rush and the need to react to every news item and price change, the lure of ""the next big thing"" is just too great to ignore. But for the long-term investor, the ""next big thing"" might just be hidden in plain sight.My PledgeFrom my years of experience in business and investing, I have come to learn that trust is earned, not bestowed.

4169574,103104,2018-05-03T19:04:17-04:00,"It's rare to see a large-cap company, such as Western Digital to be this undervalued, especially in the tech industry.The company has strong future growth prospects, a great balance sheet, and strong financials, especially when compared to competitors.Western Digital didn't rally following a recent earnings report. Both revenue and EPS beat, and guidance was strong.Western Digital is also a surprising income play, with a yield of over 2%.","Western Digital (WDC) a large-cap company that manufactures digital storage devices and is currently trading at up to a 33% discount to a fair value. Recent Q3 earnings did little to boost share value, even though they surprised investors with higher-than-expected revenue and EPS, as well as strong guidance for the coming period. For the long term, the data storage industry is poised for strong growth, driven by the exponentially growing demand for data storage. Yet, share prices are in a dip, down about a quarter from their all-time highs of about $106, which they reached in January. All signs point towards a great company with a currently undervalued share price, and strong future growth. The current dip is only a greater buying opportunity for investors to make an entry into this undervalued large-cap.WDC 50-Day Exponential Moving Average data by YChartsDespite volatility, WDC has been on a long-term upwards trend for the past few years, with the 200-Day exponential moving average jumping 226.2% in the past 10 years.Currently, $78 a share is well out of the range of these averages and soon to hit a bottom, if not there already.The company is very profitable. For the past 10 years, we've seen steady revenue growth of 136%.WDC Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsAnd, though not pictured on this graph, WDC posted a pretty high EPS of $3.63 in the most recent quarter, which beat estimates by $0.34.WDC Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsDriving the impressive revenue growth is the company's gross profit margin, which is steadily rising. In the most recent earnings report, WDC said that non-GAAP gross margin grew to 43% (not pictured on chart).WDC Total Expenses (TTM) data by YChartsAnd recently (within the year), WDC has managed to keep expenses flat while growing annual revenue.When compared to its main competitor, Seagate (STX), Western Digital looks even better.WDC Cash and Equivalents (Quarterly) data by YChartsWestern Digital has about $6.3 billion in cash (reported in most recent earnings, not pictured on YCharts), compared to Seagate's $2.55 billion.STX PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThis P/E ratio of 5.4x is extremely rare to see in a tech stock - usually, they are above 10x (like Seagate), and the industry average for data storage manufacturing companies is 15.52x.STX Price to Book Value data by YChartsPrice to Book value is the same story. As Seagate's value rockets upwards, Western Digital remains at 2x.(Computer Storage Devices - Top Stocks - Source.)Also, in the industry, Western Digital is the largest player. Again, compare P/E, P/S, and P/B ratio values. Western Digital comes in last when comparing these values to the other two large companies on the list, Seagate and NetApp (NTAP), and the company is largely undervalued.For an investor, this industry is great. Demand for some form of digital storage will always continue to grow in this data-hungry world, and the industry only has three major players. Because the majority of business in this industry comes from big enterprises, the buyers aren't likely to switch to a smaller, or newer player, and there is little room for new players.(Market Drivers - Source: Investor Presentation)However, this industry is traditionally cyclical, pushing some investors away from semis or digital memory. But recent earnings from Lam (LRCX), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), and WDC all post good guidance for increasing demand in the future, indicating that we won't see a downturn for at least a year.Let's take a look at a F.A.S.T. graph, one of my favorite valuation models out there.This analysis tool shows us multiple things. Firstly, the orange valuation line - this software calculates a fair long-term valuation based on multiple factors and charts it. The black line is the actual price of Western Digital - if it goes over the valuation line, that means that the stock is overvalued. If it goes under, then the stock is undervalued. Right now, the fair value line is picking up, but the real price is moving far underneath it, and it always has been - just another indicator that the stock is currently on sale right now.Also, adding to investor value is the slowly growing dividend and share buyback program.This chart is a representation of WDC's dividend. The last time they grew their dividend was in March 2015, and the dividend currently has a yield of 2.51%. That's a strong yield for a tech company and could be an income player. However, we feel that there will be limited upcoming dividend growth because the payout ratio exceeds 100% (116%), and while the company has a large cash reserve, it is better used to chip away at debt.This quarter, the company executed $155 million of the $500 million share buyback that had been announced. This should help with long-term growth.Now, we've been referring to the recent Q3 report, but let's look at it more specifically. They post great growth and guidance, yet see no market rally.(8% revenue growth. Source: Investor Presentation)(Results. Source: Investor Presentation)Growth in every aspect is impressive. A 52% YoY increase in EPS, and a 30% increase in operating income is no small feat.Some investors were getting worried that flash storage (which WDC is involved in) would steal Western Digital's legacy PC hard drive business, but that's not the case. In fact, revenue in this segment went up, said Stephen Milligan, CEO in the Q3 earnings call:This is great, showing healthy demand that will push the company to more growth.When discussing driving factors of this quarter's growth, Mr. Milligan said this:Guidance was equally as impressive - management expects $5.0 billion to $5.1 billion in revenues, which is above the Wall Street consensus of $5.07 billion, as well as an EPS of $3.40 to $3.50, higher than the street consensus of $3.29. Mark Long, CFO, discussed this in the same call:Yet, we didn't see an earnings spike, and five days later, shares are down 10%.So, the big question is why. Why is Western Digital receiving no love from investors?First, refer back to the F.A.S.T. graph. You'll see that for the 10-year period, the actual value of WDC has never crossed over the fair value line, meaning that share value has always been undervalued.We feel that some investors feel that a short-term spending spree by large data companies (fueled partially by crypto fever) is over, and the market is going to retract. We've seen all tech stocks taking a beating in the past few months, and these companies are simply not currently in favor, resulting in volatility.The company is also pretty leveraged, and somewhat dependent on cash flow, which may cause some investors to be wary.Despite current weakness mainly due to market conditions, numbers don't lie. WDC is a great company with solid growth and business, that is vastly undervalued. We don't usually see this value in large-caps, especially tech stocks. Following a great Q3 earnings call, shares are actually down 10%, but this dip only presents investors with a buying opportunity. Wappinger Capital Research feel that there is as much as 33% upside within a 12-month period and sets a price target of $114.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4153715,21702,2018-03-06T11:58:26-05:00,"Western Digital continues to trade in a $80-$90 range despite the excellent quarterly report delivered in late January.Yet the bullish thesis remains intact: Growing demand for digital data storage, rising cash flow, and the third largest share of the global NAND market.Meanwhile, the company has restructured debt at much more favorable terms, saving a whopping $1.25/share in estimated interest expense.I reiterate my buy recommendation and $115 price target based on management hitting, and likely exceeding, its FY18 adjusted earnings guidance of $13/share.","Western Digital (WDC) continues to hang in its $80-$90 trading range despite continued forward momentum in reducing interest expense while growing cash flow and earnings. Fundamentally, in the latest quarterly report (Q2FY18), global demand for its HDD and non-volatile NAND memory solutions was robust: Total exabytes shipped rose 22% yoy. EPS rose 75% yoy and the company generated over $2.3 billion in six-month cash flow from operations, up from CFO of $1.5 billion in the year earlier period (+53%). Gross margins were a strong 43%.In the last quarter, HDD revenue fell compared to the prior year, but was up sharply over the previous quarter as average selling prices improved. This reflected a higher percentage of HDDs being deployed in the enterprise market. WDC has an excellent product line to address this market including the helium-filled 10TB and 12TB drives. Meanwhile, HDDs continue to provide a 4-5x cost advantage ($/GB) over SSDs in a data center market:Source: WDC December PresentationIn the NAND segment, revenue grew over 20% annually in Q2 driven by the 64-layer 3D NAND product line. The company is currently in the process of rolling out its 96-layer 3D NAND products. As a result, the company is well positioned for the transition from HDD to NAND flash in the notebook and desktop markets. Unlike its main rival - Seagate Technology (STX), WDC is not watching its core HDD market share melt away without any recourse.WDC is moving its long-term HDD memory customers in the PC space over to its non-volatile SSD solutions. And this is the prime competitive advantage WDC currently has over Seagate: WDC owns the third-largest share of the global NAND market behind Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and just behind JV partner Toshiba. Currently, Seagate is shipping no NAND product whatsoever.That said, industry analysts would not be surprised to see a slight pullback in NAND prices in Q1 this year - typically a seasonally weak period for the industry:Source: EPS NewsNote that 2018 Q1/Q2 supply/demand estimates are in stark contrast to the very bullish under-supply seen in the first half of 2017. As a result, the first half results may come in a bit weak and surprise some investors. However, demand is expected to gather steam in the second half of the year.Meanwhile, management continues to take advantage of its excellent 2017 financial performance to restructure the debt load at much more favorable terms. Just last week the company announced it had redeemed a large portion of its expensive debt:The redemptions were accomplished with cash on hand as well as proceeds from previously announced offerings:As you can from the summary, the newly issued senior notes were issued at less than half the expense of the previous notes. Accordingly, management said:At the mid-point of guidance, that reduces the company's expected annual interest expense by ~$370 million (46%). With 296 million diluted shares outstanding at the end of the most recent quarter, the savings on debt restructuring alone equate to an estimated $1.25/share.The only possible reasons for WDC to still be trading in the $80-$90 range is because either:So far, neither appears to be the case. And while I'm sure management had already baked in the significant debt restructuring savings into its FY18 guidance, there's no doubt they have now achieved those savings and continue to execute according to plan. As a result, I reiterate my $115 PT and buy rating on WDC. In addition, the $0.50 quarterly dividend means the stock currently yields ~2.2%. If you are not convinced yet - and don't want to buy WDC at the top of its $80-$90 range (see graph below), which is where it stands today, you may want to wait and see if it makes another round trip back down to $80.However, I suspect WDC is going to break out to the upside sooner rather than later. After all, if management meets its $13/share in adjusted EPS this year, that corresponds to a forward P/E of only 7. Considering the average S&P 500 stock currently has a P/E=25 and likely not growing cash flow and earnings at near WDC's torrid pace, WDC is highly undervalued. And that's true even at the top of its $80-$90 trading range.Source: Yahoo Finance"
4168974,22786,2018-05-03T02:42:25-04:00,Western Digital reported a strong quarter and raised its profitability outlook.Stock closed at 52-week lows on heavy selling volume.Competitor Seagate Technology fared better after its ER yet its stock is richly valued at 25 times compared to 13 times for Western Digital.,"Despite the insistence from management that the demand for cloud storage is insatiable and will continue growing, Western Digital (WDC) stock plunged over 10 percent in the last week alone. It is now down 28 percent from 52-week highs and is valued at depressed multiples. Its P/E sits at 13 times and the forward P/E is 5.7 times. Even its competitor, Seagate Technology plc (STX) did not fall by that much after its earnings report. Seagate’s P/E is higher, too at 25 times. If valuation multiples do not explain what happened to WDC stock, what will?Western Digital earned $3.63 a share on revenue that grew 7.5 percent year-on-year to $5 billion. The company reported healthy operating cash flow and gross margin (non-GAAP) of 43 percent. Macroeconomic conditions were positive, giving cloud computing and mobility-related markets a lift. NAND flash product strength continued in the March quarter. Management cited AI, machine learning, and IoT as long-term positive catalysts that will keep driving data demands. It expects connected devices will top 75 billion units by 2025, up from 9 billion today. With such incredible growth in the decade ahead, why are markets turning sour on the stock? Short float sits at just 2.75 percent, compared to 8 percent with Seagate’s stock.Western Digital fell on the markets after its earnings report while Seagate's stock fell by less:YChartsWDC faced some “normalizing” for NAND pricing, which is expected as the product matures. 64-layer 3D NAND makes up much of its products but the company is ramping up 96-layer technology in 2018. The unit sale from Toshiba to the consortium will close (though doubts are mounting), allowing WDC to invest in two of Toshiba's Japanese plants. But investors cannot ignore the negative pressures on the Flash market in 2018, even though management forecasts supply constraints through to the second half of this year.The hint of headwinds in NAND markets may also explain the underperformance in Micron Technology (MU), a stock I also cover in the DIY (do-it-yourself) service as a deep value stock idea. Just as the single-digit P/E multiples do not justify a discount on WDC stock, the same applies to Micron. MU stock trades at a 5.5 times P/E and sub-5 times forward P/E. Investors in Micron may need to wait until later next month when the company reports earnings. Trouncing analyst estimates and raising its guidance might finally send Micron back to the $50 - $60 range.Previously, I forecast Micron would close at $50 (or above) in 2018:Source: whotradesPredicting that Micron will not stay below $50 for much longer remains to be seen (forecast posted here). Western Digital’s selloff is another matter. On March 13, I forecast 20 percent more upside in WDC stock (accessible only to DIY marketplace members or PRO subscribers).Why did the stock follow-through by peaking at above $105 and closing at $75.66 on May 2? The company will ship storage at record-level exabytes, expand its product portfolio and will grow its cash holdings from $5.1 billion. After raising its long-term gross margin from 33 percent – 38 percent to 40 percent or more, the company is well-positioned to apply the increasing cash flow to pay down debt.In the March quarter, interest expenses totaled $157 million, lower than the previous year due to refinancing. The company also cut debt by $825 million, again due to capital restructuring activities. Its total debt at the end of the third quarter was $11.4 billion.WDC may not be in a good position at this time to buy back shares to increase shareholder returns. It is authorized to buy up to 2.1 billion shares but is better off paring its debt. Interest rates may rise up to four times in total this year and 2 – 3 more times next year. But with the stock falling so quickly, management may want to re-think buying back more shares at current levels. Near-term headwinds in the normalizing of Flash pricing created investor unease, temporarily hurting the stock price. By later this year, pricing will either stay the same or go up as the demand cycle for storage resumes.In 2019, a production ramp for MAMR (microwave-assisted magnetic recording) technology will likely get its investors excited about the company’s prospects again.YChartsWestern Digital’s drop to a new 52-week low appears unjustified and irrational. The stock has a fair value of well-above $100 - $120 a share, using a 5-year DCF revenue exit model. Here, the assumption of revenue growth in the single-digits is enough to arrive at that fair value.Western Digital is not yet a DIY marketplace subscription idea but could make the list if the stock continues to fall."
4140471,21702,2018-01-26T12:18:42-05:00,"Western had a wild day of trading before its earnings were released after the bell on Thursday.As I expected, the EPS report was a beat on both the top and bottom line.Yet investors don't appear to be convinced and are left thinking the stock is going to breakout (big) one way or the other (up or down?).So I take a look at the bull and bear case in this article.Bottom line: I reiterate my 2018 price target of $115.","Western Digital's (WDC) stock took a wild and volatile ride on earnings report Thursday. The stock traded as high as $89.81 shortly after the open (up almost $3) and dove to under $84 (down almost $3) after the close on the earnings release. The stock subsequently recovered its after hours loss on upbeat comment during the conference call:Source: Google FinanceThe big swings in the stock price came on strong volume of 7.2 million shares - 75% above normal.The dramatic stock moves suggest a very nervous investor base. Indeed, TheStreet.com recently suggested investors just flip a coin to determine which way WDC might go. The analysis was mostly technical with the conclusion apparently being buy if it gets to $95 and sell if it breaks $76.72. I find that rather useless technical mumbo jumbo considering the stock just swung $3/share around $87 in a single day of trading practically in the middle of TheStreet.com's technical buy/sell points.The bears believe WDC will have continue to have integration issues with its SanDisk and Hitachi Global Storage Technology (""HGST"") acquisitions, as well as fallout from financially strained JV partner Toshiba. Bears point out that the hard disk drive market is eroding and still is responsible for a large portion of WDC's total revenue.Meantime, bears seem to think the good times are ending for WDC's growth engine: the cyclical NAND flash market. NAND has been a cash cow for Western since the SanDisk acquisition due to very strong pricing. But bears think the solid state disk (""SSD"") market is much more competitive than the three-horse HDD market - the main competitor in HDDs being only Seagate Technology (STX) and Toshiba. But in NAND flash, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) is a strong competitor in NAND flash and has roughly twice the market share of WDC (see graphic below).The bulls say that integration of WDC's acquisitions is going well, and that strong NAND pricing since the SanDisk deal has enabled WDC to be ahead of schedule in terms of its balance sheet improvement and debt reduction efforts. And while the settlement with Toshiba ended up with no clear ""winner"", WDC not only protected its interest in the JV, but secured access to the next generation of NAND flash technology and extended the JVs to 2029 (see my Seeking Alpha piece WDC Secures Next-Gen NAND Supply and Extends Toshiba JVs Out To 2029).The bulls also say that the sun is not yet setting on the HDD market and that it is still the lowest cost-per-bit solution in any high capacity relatively non-critical application - that is, access time is not the number one concern, cost is. This is true for large-scale vendors in the cloud and enterprise market segments. As a result, hyperscale enterprise storage demand for HDDs (and SDDs as well) will continue to grow with the massive amount of digital data required by applications - both old and new. Meantime, advances in HDD technology (like heat-assisted magnetic recording for instance) should support HDD competitiveness over SSDs in terms of cost/bit.Source: Statistica (Mkt Share % by the author)Meantime, bulls also point out that WDC has an excellent slice (17%) of total global branded NAND flash revenue. And that it is not only the market share WDC holds, but the overall growth rate of NAND flash revenue (see graphic above). In addition, WDC's transition to the latest NAND technology (i.e. cheaper to manufacture on a per bit basis) is coming just as the market perceives that NAND flash prices may fall.The bulls also say that, post the Toshiba settlement, WDC reiterated its FY18 full-year adjusted earnings guidance of $13/share. At today's after hours close ($86.50), that represents a forward P/E=6.6. Note the average S&P 500 P/E is currently 26.5, 4x that of WDC. Meantime, WDC also pays a $2 annual dividend, which is good for 2.3%.Those are the major bull and bear arguments. But what is real is channel checks and earnings. Let's take a look.A day before the earnings were released, Barron's reported that Nidec, the maker of motors that powers HDDs, said the HDD market in the quarter ending in December was 103 million units globally. That was 1 million more than Susquehanna analyst Mehdi Hosseini had anticipated. Going forward, Nidec sees 92 million units in the March quarter - higher than Hosseini’s 90-million unit estimate. In addition, Hosseini said he “does not see any excess hard disk drive inventory,” which he finds “encouraging.""The Q2FY EPS report was a big beat - by $40 million on the top line and $0.16/share on the bottom line. Revenue was a record $5.3 billion and, excluding charges, adjusted earnings came in at $3.95/share. The company generated $1.2 billion of CFO during the quarter and ended with $6.3 billion in cash - up from $4.9 billion in the prior year quarter. Gross margins were a very strong 43.2% (compared to 36.7% in Q2FY17 - which proves favorable integration progress is being accomplished).The company generated over a half-billion dollars of free cash flow during the quarter:Source: Q2 presentation.Net debt has been reduced by about $500 million over the past year.Comments on the conference call regarding the macro environment were positive:Total exabytes shipped were 95.3, up 9% sequentially from the previous quarter and up 23% yoy:Source: Quarterly Fact SheetThe news on NAND flash was all positive:As Barron's summed it up after the conference call, comments by WDC's CEO indicate that ""all's well with flash"". For the full year, CFO Mark Long said revenue should be toward the high end of the company's targeted range of 4%-8%. EPS for the full year is now expected to be in a range of $13.50 to $14. That is stronger than what the Street has been modeling ($13.36).Everything about WDC's Q2FY18 support the stock moving higher. Gross margins expanded, revenue grew across the board, the NAND flash outlook is favorable, and CFO and free cash flow generation continue to be impressive. Interest expense continues to drop as the company efforts to restructure its debt load has been successful.Bottom line: I am a bull. I reiterate my 2018 price target of $115/share."
4139489,103480,2018-01-23T14:51:48-05:00,"Since the beginning of 2018, Seagate's performance has outstripped Western Digital by nearly 20%.Seagate's pre-release of Q2 results, bolstered by strength in the HDD market, but this strength should carry over into Western Digital as well.Western Digital has a near-identical business mix to Seagate and is an even larger player in the HDD market than Seagate is.Seagate's rumored investment in the Ripple cryptocurrency only adds a couple points to its outperformance.Western Digital will report earnings on January 25; with HDD strong, an earnings beat is virtually guaranteed and the company will catch up to Seagate.","The market has two main players in the hard disk drive (HDD) arena: Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX). Despite these stocks historically moving rather close in tandem with each other - as they both occupy a near carbon-copy of each other's businesses - their performance has diverged rather noticeably in the first month of 2018.As seen in the chart below, Seagate is up 27% since the start of this year - making it one of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 - while Western Digital, while still posting above-index returns, has lagged far behind its cousin. The central thesis of this article is that while there are some company-specific forces at play that are pushing Seagate up (specifically, its investment in Ripple), it's not enough to justify its outperformance relative to Western Digital. With Seagate hinting at strength in the HDD market that should also be a great tailwind to Western Digital, the latter will likely see a meaningful jump as it catches up to Seagate in the near term, creating a buying opportunity before Western Digital's January 25 earnings call.WDC data by YChartsInvestors have had a rocky relationship with the HDD space over the past several years - most argue that the technology is dying out in favor of NAND flash-based memory, which doesn't come with the magnetic spinners that make HDD memory so clunky and slow. Yet, HDD has seen a bit of a resurgence in 2017, as greater use cases for data-at-rest and the explosion of data volumes in general have made a compelling case for buying hard drives for non-critical workloads, instead of their much more expensive NAND counterparts.And it's not like the HDD players are oblivious to changes in market norms, either. Both Western Digital and Seagate have made inroads into NAND flash, with Western Digital just recently settling a long dispute with Toshiba over coveted NAND supply.With these two businesses so similar, there's no reason why Seagate should be racing so substantially ahead of Western Digital: most of the lift in the stock is due to industry-wide factors.Seagate is up for two main reasons since the start of the year, which is what we'll focus on in this article. The company has been a major news hub as it 1) announced preliminary results on January 8 that resoundingly beat analyst expectations, and 2) an earth-shaking Seeking Alpha article, posted on this very site, suggested that Seagate may own up to 4% of the crypto company Ripple, with a current valuation that makes it one of the largest private unicorns.The central focus of this article is simple: Seagate's crypto associations, if properly valued, only contribute to a few points of the stock's outperformance; second, extracting this crypto-related upside, its HDD-driven gains should translate into Western Digital as well. With Western Digital due to report earnings on January 25, it's virtually guaranteed to report numbers to the upside as few investors have baked in the HDD strength read-through from Seagate's preliminary report.First, let's put a rough target on the value of Seagate's Ripple investment. The Ripple cryptocurrency XRP, at the time of writing, is trading at $1.34, giving it a market cap of $52 billion. Ripple owns ~60% of XRP's market cap ($31.2 billion), and recent analyst notes claim Seagate's stake in Ripple to be between 2-3%, stemming from Seagate's participation in Ripple's $55 million Series B round in 2016. It wasn't the lead investor; a Japanese investment company called SBI Investment was.Assuming the midpoint of 2.5% of analyst assumptions, we can estimate Seagate's Ripple-related value at $780 million - we can be generous and round this up to an even $1 billion. With Seagate's current market cap at $15.2 billion, this implies that Ripple is responsible for, at the most, 6% of Seagate's rise.And note that assuming this $1 billion value-add for Ripple is already a contentious assumption, within the past year, Ripple's value has fluctuated from a low of <$0.01 to a high of >$3. Maybe investors are banking on Ripple's value soaring in Bitcoin-style fashion to account for more a jump in Seagate, but that's an extremely speculative call that few investors are likely to make.Seagate is beating Western Digital by ~19% since the start of this year; in theory, after netting out the Ripple value, this leaves ~13% in HDD-related gains that Western Digital should be sharing in.In its January 8 press release, Seagate reported that it expects $2.9 billion of revenue in Q2, representing 10% sequential growth over Q1 revenues of $2.632 billion.Note that we're focusing on sequential growth here (instead of y/y growth, which is roughly flat) because Seagate had originally guided to 3-5% in sequential growth (producing a negative y/y comp). This is a 5-point beat to the high end of Seagate's guidance - which, considering HDD is thought of as a ""dead"" space, is truly impressive.Seagate attributes its upside performance entirely to HDD:In theory, this should play well for Western Digital as well as Seagate. After all, Western Digital has a 5-point market share lead over Seagate in HDD. Though the only possible explanation for Western Digital's failure to catch up would be if it lost market share to Seagate, this isn't too likely of an outcome, as the two companies' market shares have held steady over a long period of time. More than likely, the growth in HDD was evenly distributed across the industry.Western Digital hasn't touched its guidance since December. The consensus analyst average revenue target for Western Digital is $5.3 billion, right in line with Western Digital's own guidance. If Seagate saw upside in HDD during the holiday season after Western Digital set its guidance (on December 12), it's likely to carry over into upside for Western Digital as well. Note that hard drives have a lot of consumer end-uses, such as in PCs and gaming, so a surprise holiday bump is very much within the realm of possibility.Of course, we shouldn't be looking at these two stocks' valuations in an aquarium: it could very well be that they are both expensive. Just because one is up more than the other, doesn't necessarily mean that either is good value.It turns out, however, that this is not the case. Both Western Digital and Seagate trade at forward P/E multiples that are substantially below market averages (partially due to investors' fear that the memory super-cycle is coming to an end). With the S&P 500 at ~18-19x forward P/E, either of these stocks is a superb value buy.And Western Digital, at just 6.4x forward P/E, is substantially cheaper than Seagate - trading at more than twice its valuation. If Seagate were below Western Digital's valuation and its recent rally was just a catch-up, then it wouldn't be a major buy signal for Western Digital. But as it turns out, not only was Western Digital always the undervalued play, but the spread has widened even further.WDC PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe key sound bite from this article: Western Digital has a lot of catching up to do. If investors like Seagate this much, they should be throwing at least a little bit more love onto Western Digital. Western Digital's earnings, coming up on January 25, are very likely to be an upside catalyst to support its catch-up rally."
4155808,22786,2018-03-13T05:14:06-04:00,"Micron indirectly acted as a catalyst for markets to bid Western Digital stock to above $100.Valuations are still very compelling, implying 20% more upside for investors.Growth, strong balance sheet and relative undervaluations are some reasons to look at this hard disk supplier.","Ever since shares of Micron Technology (MU) broke out past the $50 level and skyrocketed again when an analyst set a target price of over $100, tech investors are on the prowl for the next undervalued stock. Western Digital (WDC) comes to mind. The hard drive manufacturer, which also broke out from the $80-$85 trading range, trades at above $100 but still has plenty more upside.There are six reasons WDC stock could continue moving higher.At a 7.88x forward P/E and 15.3x P/E, Western Digital is discounted compared to its competitor, Seagate Technology (STX). Seagate is valued at a 12.3x forward P/E and a 27.4x P/E. The latter has a debt/equity profile of 4 times compared to the 1x debt/equity for Western Digital. The undervaluation in the hard drive maker did not make sense when the stock traded at $80 and still makes little sense at above $100/share.Strong storage demand continues to act as a tailwind for the sector. Western Digital generated strong operating cash flow in its fiscal second quarter. Non-GAAP earnings topped $3.95 on revenue of $5.3 billion. Non-GAAP Gross margins of 43% were due to strong demand for enterprise storage and flash-based products.STX data by YChartsStrong GDP growth worldwide is correlated to storage demand. Storage requirements in mobile, cloud, AI, and IoT (albeit AI and IoT are buzz words) are adding to the demand dynamics for storage. Investors may expect revenue growth not only in the U.S. markets but also in the EU and China. Although the seasonal strength of the holiday period in the last quarter probably gave the company unusually strong sales, the trend looks likely to continue. Client Devices, for example, will benefit from a product refresh this quarter. The company started shipping 3D flash-based embedded solutions but will realize higher sales in this period.The Data Center Devices and Solutions saw demand for 10 terabyte and 12 terabyte storage units grow. The insatiable demand for storing videos, photos, and other multimedia data will result in continued pent-up demand. Expect Exabyte growth for 2018 surpassing 50 percent.The shift to 3D flash manufacturing led to better yields and therefore higher profitability for all storage manufacturers. Micron is in the middle phases of its own 3D XPoint technology. Despite “breaking up” with Intel (INTC) in its development, the technical breakthrough in the 3D-based manufacture for storage and memory would justify higher valuations for WDC stock.Western Digital ended Q2 with $6.4 billion in cash and equivalent securities and has $7.9 billion in liquidity when factoring in the $1.5 billion of undrawn revolver capacity. Another acquisition is unlikely, though one may be tempted into speculating that this would happen. After rumors of Intel buying Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) circulated after the market close last Friday, any fantasy is possible.Incidentally, Intel buying Broadcom would be a very bad idea and bad for Intel shareholders. $100 billion to buy Broadcom is cash Intel could better use investing in something else. In fact, Intel and Western Digital should both use their cash to increase their dividend and buy back shares. Neither company needs to get bigger by entering other markets. It needs to only grow market share within its existing markets.Per finbox.io, the 5-year DCF Revenue Exit model is based on the basic philosophy that the fair value of a company is equal to the future cash flows of the company, discounted back to present value. Assuming revenue growth in the next 5 years in the range of 2 percent to 7.2%, with a dip in fiscal year 2021, Western Digital still has nearly 20% more upside.Source: finbox.io (click on the link to change your assumptions)Vote on this newly created forecast that the stock is worth $120:Source: WhoTrades.comSource: finbox.ioBelow, Micron's stock takes off in the last month:MU data by YChartsThe table above shows that the hard disk makers have considerably more debt against total capital and higher debt/equity than the established semiconductor companies. Micron has tremendous growth ahead. Intel’s debt levels are low enough that it has many M&A options, should an opportunity arise. But compared to Seagate, Western Digital has a more manageable balance sheet that will only get better as sales for disk storage increase again this year.Value investors who waited too long to get the confirmation of WDC stock bottoming at the $80-$85 range may still consider the stock at above $100 a share. Unless the euphoria over Micron stock ends, currently driven by undervaluation and expectations of higher prices for DDR memory, Western Digital will likely hold current levels."
4167107,103480,2018-04-27T18:20:49-04:00,"Western Digital again failed to rally after posting strong quarterly results. Both revenue and EPS showed healthy upside to Wall Street consensus this quarter.On the guidance front, revenues were in-line with consensus, but EPS was substantially higher.Western Digital trades at a P/E under 6x.Bullish commentary from Samsung's earnings also bodes well for Western Digital's memory business.","The storage giant Western Digital (WDC) has never really been able to sustain investors' love. After a brief sharp rally above $100 during a spell of time when Wall Street analysts were praising memory stocks and predicting that the memory supercycle was long from dead, Western Digital has sunk back down to earth, and even a positive Q3 earnings release did little to lift this battered stock. From its all-time highs, Western Digital shares have lost about 20%:WDC data by YChartsEarnings strength that is met with a pullback is usually a fantastic time to buy. Investors who did so last quarter would have had a brief but huge opportunity to profit - shares tanked below $85 after a broad earnings beat in Q2, then rallied sharply in March. Now, Western Digital is back to the low $80s, but with the core business showing such strength, I don't see any reason for the company not to recover in the near future.Note also how cheap Western Digital's stock is. Against analysts' consensus EPS targets of $14.09 this year, according to Yahoo Finance, the company is currently trading at a P/E multiple of below 6x. Of course, this mirrors the valuation of other highly cyclical stocks like Ford (F). However, the strength of recent memory earnings and the commentary from industry players suggest that the cycle still has a long way to go. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), in particular, noted after posting strong memory results that it's focused on maximizing profits in its memory division rather than market share. This means that, unlike the last cycle, the major manufacturers could be showing a bit more restraint in production to keep prices and margins elevated. High pricing for memory modules, of course, is one of the major drivers behind Western Digital's success over the past year.WDC PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsNote also that with the year-to-date price movements, Western Digital's valuation has diverged even further from Seagate Technology (STX), which essentially is a pure hard drive company with much lower growth prospects. Western Digital, in contrast, has a flash division that drives tremendous growth (and wrangled for months with Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY) in order to secure it).I'm using the pullback to add to my position. Western Digital remains a top-notch pick for the long term, with fundamentals solid as we wait for the stock to regain public favor.Here's a look at Western Digital's third-quarter results:Source: Western Digital investor relationsRevenues grew 8% y/y to $5.01 billion, surpassing analyst estimates of $4.94 billion (+6% y/y) by two points. The chart below, taken from Western Digital's earnings call slides, depicts a useful breakdown of revenue growth by segment:Source: Western Digital investor relationsAs can be seen above, a majority of the revenue growth was driven by strength in Western Digital's data center business, with 25% y/y growth. The client solutions and client devices segments (which represent detached and embedded memory components, respectively) were approximately flat. Note, however, that Western Digital's CEO called out particular strength in high-capacity enterprise hard drives during the earnings call:Bears typically use the argument that Western Digital's hard drive business will soon become a drag on the company's overall results; as hard drives are a dying business that pales in power and performance relative to flash. Western Digital, however, shows us that this is not the case. Hard drives have a significant cost advantage to flash memory, and for businesses that need cheap solutions for mass data storage, there is still heavy demand for HDD products.Turning to Western Digital's gross margin - the company achieved pro forma gross margins of 43.4% in Q3, up 410bps year over year. This is a stark difference from last quarter, where Western Digital's gross margin fell slightly beneath its guidance. Now, in fact, Western Digital has upped its gross margin outlook:Operating income in the quarter grew nearly 2x to $914 million, representing an 18% operating margin. That's a 7% bump from the 11% operating margin that Western Digital achieved in 3Q17. On a net income basis, GAAP results are somewhat colored due to the fact that Western Digital had an expected one-time charge for debt extinguishment, so the pro forma numbers are the better metric to use.Pro forma EPS grew 52% y/y to $3.63, also smashing analyst consensus of $3.29 with 10% upside.On the guidance front, Western Digital has guided to $5.0 billion to $5.1 billion in revenues, against Wall Street consensus of $5.07 billion; and EPS of $3.40 to $3.50, higher than consensus of $3.29. Year to date, Western Digital has already achieved pro forma EPS of $11.12, so if we tack on the midpoint of the fourth quarter guidance of $3.45, Western Digital is likely to end FY18 with EPS of $14.57 - higher than the $14.09 analysts currently are expecting for the full year.Western Digital's core businesses are doing well. Enterprise hard drives showed surprising strength in the quarter, which helped Western Digital's legacy business lines remain at least flat. On the flash side, management has reported that the Toshiba partnership is performing ""exceptionally well."" In addition, Western Digital continues to ramp up its new-gen 3D NAND sales and production, and commentary from Samsung's earnings suggest that the pricing environment for memory products may be unexpectedly more friendly for a longer period of time.In the face of such strong fundamental results, Western Digital's lowball valuation, and its stark gap to peers such as Seagate, are a compelling invitation to buy shares."
4140393,103480,2018-01-26T05:55:42-05:00,"Western Digital reported strong Q2 earnings that beat analyst consensus on both the top and bottom line.The company also increased its guidance from the view given in December. It raised its EPS guidance to $13.50-14, implying a 6.3x forward P/E at current trading levels.Despite strong earnings, the stock fell in after-hours trading for apparently no reason.Western Digital remains one of the most undervalued stocks in the semiconductor industry.","Over the past few months, it seems that Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) remains a stock that investors love to hate. It's true that Western Digital has had its fair share of issues over the past year, but it is more or less resolved: the Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY) dispute has been settled, giving Western Digital a steady pipeline of flash supply; its core hard drive business is showing surprise strength, a trend confirmed by rival Seagate (NASDAQ:STX); and a strong earnings quarter/guidance release has confirmed a strong year ahead for the company. So why is the stock trading down after-hours on the back of a solid quarter?WDC Price data by YChartsTo be fair, Western Digital quickly recovered the majority of the post-earnings selloff that triggered immediately after its release. But after already trading behind Seagate's valuation, and after buoyant results across the industry from the likes of SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF), there's no reason Western Digital should be trading down. In all fairness, it should be trading up towards the $90s.The post-earnings selloff, in my view, presents a strategic buying opportunity into a company that has long been undervalued. Memory trends look stable heading into 2018, and most industry observers share the opinion that the cycle won't start turning sour until sometime in 2019. Trading at a P/E of just ~6x (based on the company's fresh FY18 EPS view of $13.50-14), and with financials that are showing consistent top-line growth along with earnings expansion, Western Digital seems to be a deal that's too good to pass up.Western Digital generated $5.34 billion in revenues in Q2, up 9% y/y. In its guidance given in mid-December, the company guided to $5.3 billion in revenues, and analysts were expecting exactly $5.3 billion, or 8% growth.Figure 1. Western Digital Q2 revenuesClearly evidenced by strong, near-double-digit revenue growth, end-customer demand for Western Digital memory products is holding up well. There are plenty of drivers to support elevated demand for both flash and hard drive memory. On the consumer side, think cryptocurrency and games with ultrahigh-quality graphics - all creations of recent years. Storage of this content often falls upon hard drives, resurrecting demand in what was once thought to be a dead product. On the enterprise side, an increasing number of corporates are hoarding data and treating it as a critical business asset - necessitating large purchases of both flash and hard drive memory products for critical and non-critical data, respectively. While it's true that demand is shifting from older HDD technology into more expensive flash, many businesses are still opting to put non-critical data that doesn't need continuous refreshing or access into cheaper hard drives that they can buy in bulk.It might be in the company's gross profit that investors smelled a little bit of trouble. The company's $2.0 billion of gross profit implies a 37.7% GAAP gross margin relative to the company's guidance for 38-39% margins. This may signal that the pricing squeeze on memory products has come to an end, and that chipmakers will race each other to the bottom as supply floods the market (similar to airlines' price wars), but all the evidence from competitors and industry analysts suggest otherwise. Gartner, in particular, released a recent research report that predicts revenues for the memory industry will still continue in its current growth pattern through 2018, with pricing only falling off in the back end of the year and going into 2019.It's also important to note that gross margin is still up significantly from 31.3% in 2Q17. Margins are finicky, and especially in the hardware space they can see some quarter-to-quarter fluctuation, but the key takeaway should still be the margin expansion from 2Q17 to 2Q18.Driven by top-line growth as well as by gross margin expansion, Western Digital's GAAP operating income also soared in the quarter to $955 million (an 18% margin), up more than 2x from $545 million (11% margin) from the prior-year quarter. For all the talk about Western Digital operating a ""dying"" hard drive business, the growth in profitability is difficult to argue with.Net income in the quarter is noisy due to a $1.6 billion tax-related accounting charge due to the passage of the Trump tax bill, but the company's pro forma EPS (backing out tax charges and other non-cash items) of $3.95 still grew a resounding 72% y/y over $2.30 in 2Q17 and was a 16c (4%) beat over analyst consensus of $3.79.Guidance was another key highlight of the quarter, though the views offered by Q3 and full-year guidance seem to take a different narrative. For Q3, Western Digital called for $4.9 billion in revenues (+5% y/y), whereas analysts - as compiled by Yahoo Finance - were expecting, on average, $4.94 billion (+6% y/y). For the full year, the company is sticking to its previously issued guidance of ""high end of 4% to 8% growth,"" while it nudged up its pro forma EPS guidance to $13.50-14.00, up from a vague prior guidance of ""exceeding $13.""Analysts were only calling for $13.42 for FY18. In my view, the raise in full-year earnings outlook is far more important than a one-point miss on Q3 revenue targets - especially when Western Digital has a consistent streak of earnings beats for the past seven quarters.Was Western Digital's quarter perfect and flawless? No, one could hardly say that. The slight (and I do mean slight: a measly 30bps) shortfall in gross margins certainly wasn't welcome news, nor was the slight miss to consensus Q3 targets.But on the whole, Western Digital's Q2 release had a lot more positives packed in than the sole two negatives above. This is a business that is firmly defending its turf in both flash and HDD memory, and industry conditions are still widely expected by multiple research firms to be favorable through the end of 2018, making Western Digital's raised FY18 targets highly attainable.With shares currently hovering around $85, Western Digital trades at 6.2x its FY18 EPS guidance midpoint of $13.75. Typically businesses that trade at these single-digit P/E ratios are bargain basement stocks - not ones that are showing 9% revenue growth and a near doubling of operating income.Western Digital is far from being the most rock-solid fundamental company in the markets, but at a single-digit earnings multiple, it's well worth the risk - especially with the rest of the market being as expensive as it is. Time generally exerts a correcting force on stock valuations, and Western Digital is best scooped up now before investors crowd into the trade."
4131585,21702,2017-12-13T12:10:27-05:00,"Western Digital and Toshiba have officially ended their legal battle of the SanDisk joint venture.WDC not only protected its interest in the JV, but secured access to the next generation of NAND technology and extended the JVs to 2029.Meantime, the company updated guidance to the high-end of the previous range, with non-GAAP EPS expected to hit $13/share for FY2018.The stock is extremely undervalued and should hit $115/share over the next 12 months.","Western Digital (WDC) finally closed the book on the legal challenge to Toshiba's sale of Toshiba Memory Corp (""TMC"") to a consortium led by Bain Capital Private Equity. WDC's priority was to protect the SanDisk JVs with TMC, ensure the long-term success of the JV, and guarantee long-term access to NAND supply. And that' exactly what they accomplished with by settlement of the legal challenges with Toshiba. As a result, the stock is currently quoted up $3 in pre-market trade.TERMSThe terms of the settlement agreement are as follows:Interested investors should plan to attend a conference call today at 5:30 pm EST to hear more details about the settlement. WDC also plans to provide a business update.WDC already has provided a link to updated quarterly and fiscal year 2018 guidance:Source: December 12 PresentationWhile this was basically a reaffirmation of the previous guidance given at the end of October, it is bullish because of a sell-off in the stock recently due to concerns that NAND pricing was finally weakening. As a result, Morgan Stanley had downgraded the stock to ""equal weight"" from ""overweight"" and cut its price target to $90 from $117. The brokerage firm cited sinking NAND prices and uncertainty surrounding the storage device specialists joint venture with Toshiba for the bearish outlook. Well, the cloud of uncertainty hanging over the JV has cleared, and much to the benefit of WDC shareholders. WDC management has successfully defended the company's JV with TMC, deepened the long-term relationship, and more importantly - guaranteed access to next-gen NAND technology. This always was at the core of the legal dispute in that leading-edge NAND is arguably the most important and expensive technology in cell phones next to the embedded processors.However, note that WDC had been making excellent financial progress in November and prior to the settlement with Toshiba:Source: December 12 PresentationThese steps included:In aggregate, the refinancing activities alone are expected to save the company ~$70 million per year in interest payments. That equates to $0.23/share based on the 306 million shares outstanding at the end of the company's fiscal Q1 (quarter ended Sept. 29, 2017).Despite the concern over WDC's relationship with Toshiba and the status of the SanDisk JV, and the concerns over weakening NAND pricing, WDC has emerged stronger than ever. Full-year 2017 guidance is excellent and the company was able to reach a settlement with Toshiba that guarantees access to next-gen NAND technology and further deepens the technology ties with the JVs going forward. Meantime, the company's strong cash flow and financial strength has enabled it to refinance debt at very attractive rates and significantly reduce interest payment obligations going forward.WDC is a BUY based on its $2/share dividend (2.5% yield), estimated non-GAAP earnings of $13-plus for fiscal year 2018, and the company's high market share in the global NAND market.I reiterate my 12-month price target of $125/share."
4135727,103480,2018-01-06T21:19:54-05:00,"Western Digital, the largest maker of hard drives, has traded sideways over the past six months.Shares look attractive at ~6x forward P/E, and the company also sports a fair 2.5% yield.Despite common perception that the hard drive industry is dying off, Western Digital is growing revenues by 10% and cash flows by more than 2x.Its acquisition of SanDisk has greatly accelerated its transition into the fast-growing flash memory business, and the company has settled its long-drawn flash dispute with Toshiba.In part due to the settlement of this suit, Western Digital has upped its guidance targets for FY18.","Technology and value are two categories that seemingly don't belong together in today's market - investors have to search into the deepest, oldest pockets of the industry to find value. A lot of those companies are dying - but I don't think that's true of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), the chipmaker whose single-digit P/E ratio suggests that the business is at risk.Western Digital is actually a rather remarkable company in that it's standing firmly in its core hard drive turf (along with Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), a company I also like) and maintaining its #1 market share in HDDs and growing its exabyte shipments, while at the same time aggressively pursuing growth in NAND flash technology. Its protracted dispute with Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY) over the sale of its flash manufacturing unit has come to an end, giving Western Digital a clear path for growth in the flash business.In this sense, Western Digital is somewhat analogous to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Microsoft's legacy Office and Windows businesses aren't growth stars anymore either - it's hanging on to market share in those areas while chasing growth in Azure infrastructure and Dynamics cloud apps. Microsoft has been a stellar performer in the markets lately, rising nearly 2x in the past two years. Western Digital's HDD and flash businesses can be thought of in the same way - eventually, the company will have its day in the sun.At current levels in the low $80s, Western Digital is trading at ~6x forward earnings - far below the broader market and even at a substantial discount to fellow beleaguered hard drive peer Seagate.WDC PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsA recent (and I believe unwise) downgrade has sent Western Digital shares into a funk, so I'm looking for opportune buying opportunities as the stock hovers near $80. Any dip below and I'm loading up on shares.With markets so high and growth names enjoying a long-drawn victory lap, investors are wise to rotate a good amount of their portfolios into value names. With its ultra-cheap valuation, and supported by strong fundamentals in the memory business - both in hard drives and flash - Western Digital is a strong horse to bet on for the coming year.Western Digital is mostly known for its hard drive products - hardware that stores data by means of spinning magnetic disks. In recent years, however, flash memory (which requires no moving parts) has become the most popular form of storage, with much faster and more reliable performance. Western Digital pushed heavily on flash in 2016, when it acquired SanDisk for $19 billion. Still, however, flash is much more expensive than HDD storage, making HDDs the storage method of choice for non-critical data that doesn't need to be continually accessed.As I wrote in a prior article on Seagate, demand for hard drives is strongly driven by the current explosion in enterprise data - and not all this data needs to be ""always on."" Hard drives give data-rich companies a cost-effective solution to store their ""data at rest.""Growth in NAND flash, on the other hand, is being driven by strong shipments of PCs and mobile devices - all of which are requiring larger memory capacities, as applications become more rich and eat up more memory.With a foot in each of the two markets in the non-volatile memory space (as opposed to RAM, the type of memory that loses its content when a device is powered off), Western Digital looks well poised to continue its growth run. The IT industry is increasingly deploying what Western Digital calls a ""tiered architecture"" for storage - using HDDs and flash in concert to address different use cases. The notion that flash is cannibalizing HDDs is partially true, but it's not killing off HDDs altogether, as there's still a large and stable market for this cheaper legacy technology.Think of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and the electric car - just because a better, fuel-efficient and aesthetic vehicle exists in the market doesn't mean that the Models S, X, and 3 will ever completely kill off gasoline vehicles. Lower-end, ""inferior"" technologies can co-exist in the market with higher-priced alternatives. And with leading positions in both markets, Western Digital will enjoy the benefits of data growth no matter what turn the memory industry takes. There's certainly no reason for this company to continue trading at a single-digit P/E ratio for much longer.Multiple companies have cited strong outlooks for the memory industry in the coming year, lending credibility to the thesis that Western Digital can see a multiples re-ration and have its valuation ""corrected"" on the back of consecutive earnings beats this year.Let's start with Western Digital's own forecast. In October, after releasing 1Q18 earnings, Western Digital guided to $5.2-5.3 billion in revenue for Q2 and pro forma EPS of $3.60-3.70, as well as $12.50 in pro forma EPS for FY18. After the company's resolution of its Toshiba dispute, it's now calling for $5.3 billion in revenue for Q2 and $3.80 in EPS, as well as $13.00 in EPS for FY18 as well as 4-8% revenue growth. See the company's updated guidance summary below:Figure 1. Western Digital guidanceSource: Western Digital investor relationsNote that Western Digital's PF EPS guidance of $13 greatly exceeds the $9.19 it achieved in FY17.Western Digital isn't the only memory company issuing upbeat guidance, either. Rival Seagate's most recent Q1 earnings quarter was a huge success, and the company guided to 3-5% sequential revenue growth and a sequential doubling of operating cash flow. Micron (NASDAQ:MU), the maker of raw NAND flash memory wafers for end-products like Western Digital's, pointed to a 50% increase in NAND bit shipments. Note that stabilizing NAND prices and an improved supply picture are not altogether a negative situation for Western Digital, as a vertically integrated company whose anchor business is in memory end products, not wafers, more competitive NAND pricing translates to significant gross margin savings for Western Digital.Western Digital has kicked off its fiscal 2018 with a bang thus far. The company saw a 10% y/y increase in Q1 revenues to $5.2 billion, driven by 13% growth in the company's Client Devices segment (which supplies memory to hardware such as PCs) and 16% growth in Client Solutions (which provides removable memory devices). Revenues beat analyst consensus by $40 million.A note here on Client Solutions: as end-uses such as video games become more graphically complex and memory-consuming, storage companies have seen surprise uplift in demand for removable memory from gamers; in addition, the growing popularity of cryptocurrency has likewise fueled demand for detached memory products to store bitcoins. The growth in Western Digital's retail product segments have more than offset flat y/y performance in its enterprise data center business, but as IT spending kicks up in the December quarter (Western Digital's Q2) and data volumes continue to expand, the company should see a return to growth in data center memory products.See the company's Q1 summary chart below:Figure 2. Western Digital's most recent quarterly resultsSource: Western Digital Q1 earnings releaseAlso notable is the fact that exabyte shipments have increased in every segment, including data centers (the flat y/y revenue is attributed to declining enterprise ASPs). Total HDD ASP across segments, however, has remained steady at $61 per unit.As mentioned in the prior section, Western Digital expects to continue its top-line trajectory in Q2 with $5.3 billion in revenue guidance, representing 8% y/y growth over 2Q17's $4.89 billion in revenue.Note also Western Digital's extremely strong cash flow performance in Q2. Cash flow from operations is up nearly 3x to $1.13 billion, and free cash flow is up nearly 4x to $847 million. Pro forma EPS of $3.56 in the quarter was also a notable beat over Wall Street's expectations for $3.30.The key sound bite from this high-level overview of Western Digital: the company has smartly diversified and has leading positions in both the HDD and flash memory markets, the latter of which is now safe after the company's dispute resolution with Toshiba. The company's Q1 results and FY18 outlook are extremely bullish - yet the company's share price, trading at just ~6x forward earnings, appears to suggest that the market doesn't believe the company's guidance.Investors are skeptical that the favorable trends seen in the memory market in the past two years can continue - after all, companies like Micron are pointing to ~50% supply growth. Yet demand for memory end-products is also keeping up at a rapid pace as applications not only multiply in number and diversity but also consume an increasing amount of storage space; and as the leading maker of memory products, Western Digital stands to benefit from that secular shift.While it's true that Western Digital is no longer a growth stock and must work hard to defend its turf, it has a wide enough moat to justify buying the stock at a single-digit P/E multiple - at the very least, its 2.5% yield is high enough to keep patient investors happy."
4104292,101850,2017-09-05T18:29:39-04:00,The Toshiba Memory saga is in its final innings.Toshiba is stalling for a bigger stake post sale.While its creditors are pushing for a quick sale.A delisting scenario is not feasible and will put Toshiba in a major financing crunch.The clock is ticking and incentives are finally aligned for a sale.,"After an action-packed August, we should be heading for an agreement in the coming weeks, with the key question not really if Western Digital (WDC) will participate, but how the deal structure will ultimately pan out. This time looks to be different, and we should come to an agreement soon as Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) is once again stuck between a rock (selling its memory unit to realize book value revaluation) and a really hard place (financing crunch in a delisting scenario).Key DevelopmentsSince my last update, the overarching Toshiba-WDC tone has shifted from being extremely confrontational (see Toshiba opting for a unilateral investment in Fab 6) to conciliatory (see apology letter from Milligan). This has spilled over to WDC’s stock price, fluctuating from sub $80 lows to >$90 highs.Here’s a brief timeline of events surrounding the Toshiba Memory sale in August/ early September alone:Aug 3 - Toshiba announces its decision to unilaterally invest in Fab 6 in Yokkaichi with commitments ~¥195bn (vs bilateral ¥180bn)Aug 3 - California Court of Appeal denies Toshiba’s petition to stay the temporary restraining order by the Superior CourtAug 9 - PwC grants qualified opinion on securities report for fiscal year ended March 2017, moving Toshiba one step closer to avoiding delistingAug 15 - Reports of Toshiba disagreement with the Bain Capital consortium over timing of payment for chip unit sale begin to surfaceAug 15 - Toshiba ordered to restore Western Digital access to specific data stored on Toshiba Memory databasesAug 19 - Toshiba’s main lenders demand Toshiba Memory sale contract signed by end-August, speculations about a memory IPO begin to surfaceAug 20 - Toshiba lenders turn down possibility of Toshiba Memory IPO after Toshiba President Satoshi Tsunakawa earlier this month asked the company's lenders for their opinion on the possibility of the IPO planAug 23 - Toshiba and Western Digital enter talks on sale of flash memory unit, aiming to reach deal by end-AugAug 24 - More rumors about a potential Western Digital deal structure surface, biggest lenders reportedly pushing harder for quick saleAug 27 - Asahi Shimbun reports that Toshiba has agreed to sell its memory unit to the Western Digital consortium, WDC CEO meets Toshiba president to discuss detailsAug 30 - Toshiba reportedly prepares to grant Western Digital consortium exclusive negotiating rights to acquire flash memory unitAug 30 - Bain Capital and Hon Hai consortiums make revised offersSept 3 - Western Digital wants involvement in Toshiba Memory management, delaying deal finalisationIn summary, it’s been a pretty action packed month for deal watchers, and those who stuck to their guns on WDC’s watertight case, should have profited nicely from the temporary dip in early-mid August. In any case, things look to be going WDC’s way from here with a deal (hopefully) set to be struck sometime this week.What Would a Potential WDC Deal Look Like?For one, the deal valuation has hovered around the ¥2tn mark, although recent reports have suggested the WDC consortium might get it for less ~¥1.9tn.The WDC consortium, if reports thus far are to be believed, will consist of KKR, INCJ, DBJ and other Japanese parties (including creditors). For revaluation purposes, I suspect we’ll see Toshiba retain a small stake as well.The next important question - who funds what? Contrary to speculation in the earlier stages of the deal, WDC likely will not be taking an equity stake (thanks to Toshiba’s timetable slippage), instead opting for convertibles with an option to buy into the entity at a later date. The logic behind convertibles would be to avoid a potential regulatory setback from China’s MOFCOM or other regulators, while providing some “skin in the game”.The financial buyers (KKR, INCJ, DBJ) should take on the lion’s share of the funding with the remaining funding needs (ex Toshiba and WDC) filled by Japanese lender banks and other Japanese companies.Here’s an illustrative funding structure:(Source: Citi)From WDC’s perspective, in exchange for ¥150bn in financing, they effectively gain control over the JVs for a fraction of the total ¥1.9tn. There will however, likely be a cap as if WDC’s stake exceeds one-third, WDC would have veto power in the new structure so their post conversion stake should be capped below that level.Meanwhile, if voting shares are negotiated in line with this structure, the Japanese (possible proxy for Toshiba) would retain ~40% voting rights, a favorable outcome for both parties on the whole.Why Toshiba is Stalling The InevitableTo understand why Toshiba is fighting so hard to hold onto its memory unit from a financial perspective (behind the scenes rumors aside), sensitizing various stake sale scenarios is particularly enlightening.So, let’s assume a 100% sale right off the bat. This increase breaks down as ¥1.11trn in gains on the sale and FY17 operating profit of ¥400bn and excludes ¥62.4bn of taxes. Management estimates the improvement in shareholders' equity at ~¥700bn but this significantly underestimates potential accretion as it excludes lower taxes from tax allocation accounting from its nuclear business losses (~¥1.3tn). Including tax effects is estimated to yield an improvement in shareholders' equity to ¥863.7bn at end-FY17.That sounds great on paper, but what if Toshiba keeps a stake in the business post memory sale? BPS could actually increase as a result of the revaluation of assets. Assuming the the memory chip business generated operating profit of ¥300bn, with ¥200bn flowing through to net profit, every 10% stake retained would yield an incremental ¥5 per share.(Source: UBS)Under the proposed funding structure, a ¥600bn investment in common stock could yield 100% control over a ¥2trn business (assuming 60/40 common/ preferred allocation). The amount needed to acquire 10% of the memory chip business would thus, only be ~¥60bn, or 10% of the estimated ¥600bn of common stock, rather than the full ¥200bn, or 10% of ¥2trn. Considering the favorable cost-benefit of increasing its stake in the memory unit sale, Toshiba is incentivized to push for a higher share rather than a quick sale.Debunking The Delist and IPO ScenarioToshiba has floated the idea of delisting and taking the memory unit public itself, likely buoyed by recent NAND strength. This idea sounds great in theory but does not work in reality.For one, as appealing as spinning off its memory unit themselves may seem, doing so will be much harder in reality. Firstly, going public requires two years' worth of balance sheets and income statements. Toshiba Memory, which was just split off on 30 March 2017, would only meet this requirement on 30 March 2019, one year after the delisting deadline.Secondly, this idea assumes that Toshiba is the only party with skin in the game. The reality is that Toshiba is most influenced by its creditors, which given the securing of debt against Toshiba Memory shares, gains nothing from a 1-2 year delay and will thus, insist on a quick disposal.As of FY3/16, the four major Japanese banks account for over ¥600bn (54%) of Toshiba’s total bank borrowings.In the event that 1) Toshiba fails to sell its memory unit or 2) if it gets delisted and loses its access to equity funding or 3) suffers a funding gap from lowered valuations post delisting, they would require financial support from their main creditors, who would in turn, need to downgrade their Toshiba loans at least to “special attention” debt.The earnings impact would be relatively large at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust (OTCPK:SUTNY), with the second most significant impact at Mizuho (MFG), both of which would need to allocate a large amount of capital to cover their existing Toshiba loans (as much as 8x existing CET1 coverage, 11-12x RP for Mizuho).Barring an injection from the government, a delisting scenario is thus, not as harmless as some would have you think. Creditor incentives have been aligned with a quick sale and that should prevail in the coming weeks considering the stakes.WDC Deal Still The Most Likely OutcomeI think base case i.e. sale to WDC consortium, should still prevail even if Toshiba favors an IPO further down the line. No matter how you spin it, Toshiba is still a company in distress and will thus be most influenced by its creditors, which given the securing of debt against Toshiba Memory shares will insist on disposal. Toshiba may have accepted a delisting fate, but their hands are tied by creditors, who will be firmly blocking that path.In any case, if this excerpt from Goldman’s disclosure last Friday is any indication, the wheels might already be in motion.(Source: Goldman Sachs)Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4102713,101421,2017-08-29T13:41:09-04:00,Western Digital has acquired the assets of Upthere for an undisclosed sum.Upthere has developed a cloud storage system for consumers.WDC previously invested in Upthere's private financing rounds and will use the technology to bolster its Client Services offerings under new hire Barbara Nelson.,"Quick TakeData storage hardware firm Western Digital (WDC) has acquired the assets of cloud storage software company Upthere for an undisclosed amount.Upthere has created a cloud-based personal media storage service for consumers to more easily storage their photos, videos and other media from any device.Western Digital acquired Upthere as an important addition to its Client Services group, which along with new hire Barbara Nelson, promises to move WDC toward a more software- and services-centric business model.Target CompanyRedwood City, California-based Upthere was founded in 2011 to make it easier and more foolproof for users to save their media, so it is available for any of their devices anywhere.Management is headed by CEO Chris Bourdon, who has been with the firm since August 2012 and was previously Sr. Product Line Manager for Apple’s (AAPL) Mac OS X operating system.Below is a brief overview video about Upthere’s system:(Source: Upthere)Upthere’s primary offering is a cloud-based software system that is platform-agnostic and available for Android, iPhone, iPad, macOS and Windows PC ecosystems.The company offers a free 3-month trial for 100GB of storage and charges $1.99 per month thereafter for each 100GB storage increment.Notably, Western Digital co-led with Kleiner Perkins the company’s sole major financing, a $77 million round in July 2016 that also included Elevation Partners, GV (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Floodgate and NTT DoCoMo Ventures.Acquisition Terms and RationaleNeither company disclosed the acquisition price or terms.WDC didn’t file an 8-K, nor did it provide any change to financial guidance as a result of the deal. Also, the acquisition was for the ‘assets’ of Upthere, denoting a low acquisition price, so I presume the deal was not material to WDC’s financial condition and probably not a win for its venture capital firm investors.WDC acquired Upthere as part of an emerging strategy to pivot toward providing more software-enabled services via a subscription model.The firm’s historical focus on hardware storage solutions is becoming increasingly challenging, as software is becoming more important to the consumer’s experience.Additionally, software services provide ongoing, subscription-based revenue streams which tend to be more predictable when compared to hardware development and adoption cycles.Upthere will be folded into WDC’s Client Solutions unit, and CEO Bourdon will join the group as a ‘strategic leader.’Western Digital also announced that Barbara Nelson was appointed to lead the Cloud Services business. Nelson was previously EVP and general manager at cloud security business IronKey, and ‘has led the growth of businesses from concept to over $100 million on four separate occasions.’Given WDC previous relationship with Upthere, integration risk should be minimal. Assuming it didn’t overpay for its ‘asset’ acquisition, the deal is promising for WDC and should provide a base from which to pursue the build-out of its Client Services offerings.With an impressive hire in Nelson running Client Services, WDC has a shot at turning the corner and transitioning toward a more balanced combination of revenue streams.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, and IPOs.

Total operating expenses declined by 8.6% as cost-cutting and ongoing integration efforts of previous acquisitions are obviously bearing fruit. The total outstanding diluted share count increased 7.4%. As a result, Q1 per-share gross profit increased to $6.52/share as compared to $4.68/share in the year earlier period.The Q1 $0.50/share quarterly dividend compares favorably to the net income of $2.23/share (GAAP) and even better to $3.56/share (non-GAAP).

Strong demand will be driven by new generation cell phone devices with higher NAND capacity. Meantime, the HDD demand curve is starting to smooth out as data centers take over from the historical PC demand-driven roller-coaster. Gross margins should be north of 40% for FY2018 as the company continues to benefit from significant cost synergies from the SanDisk and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (""HGST"") acquisitions. That said, R&D expenses are likely to remain somewhat elevated as the company continues to focus on long-term strategic technology development.Note that DRAM and NAND memory providers rallied sharply after Samsung's (OTC:SSNNF) blowout earnings report was released yesterday and is more evidence of continuing strength in the global NAND market.WDC's diluted earnings per share are expected to come in at $12.50/share for calendar year 2017, including $3.65 for Q2FY2018 (the quarter ending December 31, 2017). FY18 non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in the neighborhood of $13/share.Meantime, the Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) saga continues. Western Digital said on the quarterly conference call that it still plans to participate in JVs like Fab 6 if the companies can resolve differences. Yet WDC is not confident in that their differences will be resolved.WDC has made a number of allowances to try to meet Toshiba's needs. Most notably, WDC withdrew from the INCJ-KKR consortium. This eliminated its participation in TMC equity ownership and minimized any regulatory risk. That move directly addressed key concerns of TMC's management. It has been clear that throughout the entire TMC sale proceedings, WDC has been pro-active in trying to resolve the dispute. Yet every time WDC gives an inch, TMC raises the bar just a bit higher. As a result, WDC will likely be at an advantage when the arbitration panel looks at which of the JV partners were actively trying to resolve the dispute prior to the request for arbitration.But the bottom line is that WDC is very well-positioned from a legal perspective with respect to SanDisk's rights under the current TMC joint venture agreement. Note WDC's successful track record in the California courts in this regard. On October 5, the International Court of Arbitration confirmed the three-member arbitration panel. Shortly thereafter, WDC informed the panel of its intention to seek injunctive relief to prevent Toshiba from transferring its JV interests to SK Hynix-Bain-Apple (AAPL) consortium without SanDisk's consent. WDC believes SanDisk's consent rights under the existing JV are clear and explicit, and the company is confident in its request for injunctive relief. WDC said it expects a ruling in the first part of 2018 in advance of Toshiba's announced time frame to close the proposed transaction.WDC is guiding for $13/share in earnings this year, which at the current price of $90 implies a forward P/E of just ~7x. I believe such a low P/E for a company with excellent and indispensable NAND technology means WDC is very much undervalued. The stock should be trading significantly north of $100/share - and that is without a favorable resolution to the TMC drama. Yet all previous court-related rulings indicate WDC is likely to be the winner in the upcoming arbitration. In addition, WDC says it is well positioned to receive NAND supply from the Toshiba joint venture through 2029 and targets growth of 35-45% in calendar year 2019 - regardless of the Fab 6 investment. A realistic P/E of 9x on top of $13 in expected EPS means WDC should be trading at $117. And, that price target is without a positive outcome from the arbitration panel. With an injunctive relief, I suspect WDC will rally up to $125 as the market clearly is discounting a positive (for WDC...) resolution to the JV dispute.Meantime, the stock yields 2.2%. WDC is a BUY.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
4107480,21702,2017-09-17T06:05:48-04:00,"Apple is apparently part of a consortium vying for Toshiba's new chip plant.You can't blame it, NAND is one of the costliest components in an iPhone.However, Western Digital has made it clear it will defend its rights under the existing JV.And the outcome - if Toshiba spurns Western Digital - will be determined in the courtroom, not with public press releases.","Bloomberg reports that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to take an equity stake in Toshiba's (OTCPK:TOSYY) chip unit of an estimated 16% as part of a consortium led by Bain Capital that also includes Dell (DVMT), Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF). Apparently Toshiba has signed a memorandum of understanding with Bain with the goal of inking a final agreement this month. Apple is obviously making the move to protect its NAND chip supply. Not only that, but also cell phone competitor Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) has the largest market share in NAND production. Apple certainly does not want to become increasingly dependent on Samsung for such a critical component.But can the deal be consummated without the agreement of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC)? The sale of Toshiba's chip unit has been held up for months because WDC - a joint venture partner with Toshiba in its chip business - has argued it has rights in any sale and filed for arbitration in the United States. Regardless, Apple's move looks opportunistic considering Toshiba needs to raise the money by March to avoid seeing its shares de-listed from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. However, it seems as though court delays could certainly push closure of the deal past the deadline.But the Toshiba auction has been a circus since day 1 due to the strategic importance of NAND and the well capitalized players involved. Every day brings a new ""winner"" (and loser). But with so many moving parts, it's hard to predict the outcome. Japan certainly wants to shield its technology from getting into the hands of Chinese chip manufacturers. The Japanese government would like to retain some interests as it is certainly aware of the stakes. Apple wants a cheap supply and more diversity of qualified sources. Bain Capital smells opportunity amidst the chaos and Seagate knows its very survival is at stake (see my Seeking Alpha article: Western Digital Versus Seagate). But Toshiba's bankers want their money and a WDC legal challenge is likely to delay the pay-day, leading to a potential de-listing for Toshiba.As a result, WDC's stock has been on a roller-coaster ride, gyrating wildly in a band from $80 to $95 over the past couple of months. Today it's up $2.58 which means there is likely a new (and meaningless) press release.I say meaningless because ""winners"" and ""losers"" in this NAND drama have been predicted and written about many times over the course of this auction. But until contracts are signed, legal challenges are resolved, and the ""winners"" and ""losers"" are actually known, it's all ""ka-ka"" in my opinion.But what about WDC even if it does not ""win"" in this battle? The fundamentals of the company still look very strong given its SanDisk unit's healthy 17.3% market share in Q2:Source: Semiconductor Business IntelligenceThat is up over a percentage point from 16.1% in Q4 FY16 (Source: IDC). Yet as the first graphic above shows, Samsung is a monster in leading edge memory solutions, and that is obviously a concern for Apple.So WDC is already well positioned in NAND even if it were to lose out in the current Toshiba auction. Seagate is obviously playing catch-up. As evidence, I offer the analysis in my comparison article referenced earlier of the two companies' Q2 EPS reports. And memory demand is accelerating - with the memory in the lowest tier new iPhone doubling in the new iteration and quadrupling in the past year (see iPhone 8 and iPhone X).Despite the high-profile entry of Apple into the Toshiba chip unit sale circus, the truth is this: WDC's rights within the Toshiba JV will be settled in a courtroom - not with public press releases. And if Toshiba was confident in the outcome of such a legal battle, why had it not gone forward with a sale much earlier?So the final answer is likely months away if Toshiba does not play-ball with WDC, and that is a very risky game for Toshiba to play considering the risk of being de-listed. This is probably why Toshiba's press releases have contained unusually non-binding language. It seems to me Toshiba is merely trying to motivate the Western Digits/KKR consortium to sweeten its bid.The WDC/KKR team is likely to be the winner because it is - apparently - the choice of the Japanese government. The government obviously would not like to see Toshiba de-listed and it also would like to keep the number of companies with access to critical NAND technology to a minimum. I still think WDC comes out a winner in this drama. WDC is a BUY based on continued strong NAND pricing, continued cost cutting as a result of its earlier Hitachi acquisition, its excellent position in the SSD market, and the likelihood of coming out the eventual winner in the Toshiba auction.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4102748,101421,2017-08-29T14:45:48-04:00,Western Digital has agreed to acquire Tegile Systems for an undisclosed sum.Tegile is a leading provider of all-flash and hybrid-flash storage technology solutions to the data center market.WDC will be able to add Tegile's flash technologies to its Data Center Systems business unit to broaden its offerings.,"Quick TakeStorage technology firm Western Digital (WDC) has announced an agreement to acquire hardware maker Tegile Systems for an undisclosed amount.Tegile has created what it calls ‘IntelliFlash’ architecture that provides storage capabilities with flash memory hardware.WDC is acquiring Tegile to add all-flash and hybrid flash storage solutions to its Data Center Systems division and broaden its offerings to its customer base.Target CompanyNewark, California-based Tegile was founded in 2010 to develop storage solutions that provide high input/output speed and low latency for applications like database operations and virtualization environments.Management is headed by co-founder and CEO Rohit Kshetrapal, who was previously a director at Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO).Below is a brief overview video about Tegile:(Source: Tegile Systems)Tegile has numerous products that utilize either all-flash or hybrid flash technologies.Hybrid flash technologies can increase performance significantly without the higher investment that all-flash products require.The company has robust partnership programs divided between resellers and ‘alliance’ partners, of which Western Digital was an alliance partner.Tegile raised approximately $175 million in disclosed financing from a large syndicate of investors, including Western Digital, which participated in Tegile’s last two funding rounds and led its most recent round in April 2017 for $33 million.Acquisition Terms and RationaleNeither company disclosed the acquisition price or terms and WDC didn’t file an 8-K or provide any change in forward financial guidance, so the deal appears to be not material to its financial condition.WDC’s current market cap exceeds $26 billion, so the definition of ‘materiality’ may still allow for the deal to be a pretty good-sized acquisition, say in the $200 million to $300 million range, but WDC may not be required to provide details.After closing, Tegile will be integrated into WDC’s Data Center Systems [DCS] business unit under Phil Bullinger, SVP and GM of DCS for Western Digital.As Bullinger stated in the deal announcement,WDC added, ‘The acquisition is expected to accelerate the DCS business unit’s revenue growth as Tegile’s high-value, high-growth flash storage arrays complement the DCS products and can be marketed to Western Digital’s global customer base.’So, by adding all-flash and hybrid storage, WDC gets to market those solutions to its customer base. It also will acquire Tegile’s 1,700 strong customer base that it can cross-sell its products as well.The deal makes sense for WDC, as the addition of Tegile will provide its customers with a full range of the latest flash storage options.I write about M&A deals, public company investments in technology startups, and IPOs.

4102356,21597,2017-08-28T12:40:14-04:00,"Samsung Electronics has decided to build a 3D NAND production line at its plant in China, further increasing capacity.This and news that Samsung Electronics increased market share in Q2 is a catalyst for Toshiba to settle its legal issues with Western Digital, resuming normal NAND production in Korea.The impact of the renewed synergy between the two companies will in the long term increase capacity which should decrease NAND spot and contract prices.","Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) announced it will add a new production line at the sight of its first semiconductor fabrication line in Xi’an, which was constructed in 2014 and is presently in full operation. The $7 billion line will be used to make 3D NAND chips.The announcement of additional competition coming from Samsung Electronics, already the leader in the NAND market, to me is the tipping point in the Toshiba (TOSBY) negotiations, and I predict that Western Digital (WDC) together with Toshiba will continue production together in one of the world's largest memory chip fabrication facilities in Yokkaichi, Japan.The impetus for continuing the synergy between the two companies is a report from DRAMeXchange that Samsung Electronics’ share in the NAND flash market increased 1.2% to 35.6% in the second quarter while Toshiba’s market share decreased 1.3% from Q1 2017. The gap between the two companies widened from 15.6% in Q1 to 18.1% in Q2.I was among the first if not the first author to write an article in Seeking Alpha about the Toshiba chip sale and speculated that Western Digital would emerge the winner. I discussed the potential scenarios for different competitors in a January 23, 2017, SA article entitled “Western Digital's Future Business Depends On Toshiba's NAND Spin-Off Decision.”The decision to stay with Western Digital has numerous investor implications. First, it will be a tremendous positive for WDC, meaning that it assures the company continued production ability in leading edge 3D NAND memory chips at the Yokkaichi, Japan plant.Secondly the move will make SK Hynix, the other memory company in the running, from further increasing production capacity and thus increasing market share against Micron Technology (MU).Thirdly with problems behind them, Toshiba and Western Digital should resume normal operations at existing production plants. WDC’s NAND share increased to 17.5% QoQ, equal to Toshiba’s, according to the chart below. But the possibility of impending litigation between the companies over the past several months impacted Toshiba’s output (as market share dropped) as well as WDC’s (market share growth of only 0.1%) and was partially responsible for the rise in average selling prices in NAND as a result of lower production. I had pointed out in a July 13, 2017, Seeking Alpha article entitled “Micron Technology Continues To Outperform The Memory Industry As A Whole,” that NAND prices were forecast to drop in Q3 as capacity rose. With NAND production impacted at Toshiba/WDC, the drop in ASPs should be pushed out to at least Q4. This suggests continued increases in ASPs, which have been directly responsible for increases in MU’s stock price.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4096472,82156,2017-08-08T15:45:17-04:00,"Investors should not be scared off by Toshiba's negotiation tactics as WDC's legal position is strong and Toshiba has a tremendous need to get this dispute resolved.WDC's shares now trade at a PE multiple of 6.45, and a trailing PE of 8.2. The Toshiba risk is being overvalued.Because of WDC's inherent leverage in the negotiation, a deal which is fair and favorable to WDC is likely.Investors should support WDC management in taking the time to get the negotiation of this critical deal done right, not just done fast.Investors should take advantage of WDC's short-term depressed price.","Shares of Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ: WDC) were hit hard on Friday on a Bloomberg report that Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF, OTCPK:TOSYY) has decided to attempt to cut WDC out of the supply from the new NAND Flash Fab known as Fab 6.Despite reporting non-GAAP 4th quarter earnings of $2.93 per share-- nearly five percent above Street expectations, WDC shares are down 15 per cent since the earnings release, carving $three billion off its market cap. Western Digital earned non-GAAP EPS of $9.19 per share for the full fiscal year ended June 2016, and is forecasted by the consensus of the 29 analysts who cover the company to earn non-GAAP EPS in this coming year of 12.54.As a result, WDC's shares now trade at a PE multiple of 6.45, and a trailing PE of 8.2. For a company which is the leader in the (now consolidated) disk drive space, and is one of three global leaders in the critically important NAND flash memory space, a forward PE multiple under 7 is simply too low and affords investors a compelling entry point.The fall in value is due primarily to the in terrorem effect of the company’s dispute with Toshiba, WDC’s joint venture partner in the production of NAND devices. Specifically, the damage to the stock price is attributable to an indefensible negotiation position taken by Toshiba, which has been aggressive in trying to manufacture a point of leverage in its ongoing contract negotiation with WDC.Smart investors will take advantage of the excessive discount afforded by the short-term weakness in WDC, borne of the acrimony and perceived uncertainty inflicted by Toshiba. Moreover, astute investors will join with other shareholders in urging WDC management to hang tough in its negotiations with Toshiba and to not feel pressure to prematurely resolve the dispute on terms that are not in its best long- term interest.Toshiba’s negotiation position is weak. This is a critical negotiation for WDC, and WDC should not yield to the of stock market volatility by giving up long term gain to alleviate short-term pain of volatility in its stock price. In the end, WDC shareholders will benefit most from a fair deal, not from a fast deal, as much as a fast deal would be comforting.Toshiba’s Negotiation Tactic is likely to backfire.Toshiba’s legal posture is indefensible, and if it continues with this strategy, it will almost certainly prevent Toshiba from consummating the sale of the Toshiba memory business, which is critical to Toshiba’s survival. If this dispute must continue to adjudication, Toshiba is likely to get its clock cleaned in the arbitration and litigation that will sort out WDC’s rights.Because of this negotiating dynamic, it is highly likely that with appropriate patience, WDC will be able to negotiate an acceptable outcome to this impasse, which assures ongoing access to NAND supply at attractive pricing and delivery terms.The discussion below provides a backdrop of this acrimonious negotiation, a brief analysis of why Toshiba’s negotiating posture is a loser, and an explanation of why investors should take advantage of the depressed valuation of WDC. 1) Toshiba has been down this road before, and the last time, it drove itself into a ditch.Institutions who have invested in the NAND space will see history repeating itself in Toshiba’s belligerent approach to a joint venture partner. In 2005, Toshiba tested its luck in court with another joint venture partner, another innovative American company that was itself also in pioneer flash technology, Lexar Media.Lexar was at the time, one of SanDisk’s two main competitors. In that case, Toshiba had partnered with Lexar to develop various Flash applications. Having obtained from Lexar the trade secrets and knowhow Toshiba needed, Toshiba quietly decided to go it alone and cut Lexar out of the partnership. Lexar had no choice but to sue.Toshiba was found liable by a jury of breach of fiduciary duty and theft of trade secrets. The jury awarded Lexar $465 million of compensatory and punitive damages. While the court subsequently reduced the amount of the award, the finding set Lexar up for a favorable settlement with Toshiba, negotiated by Lexar from a position of great strength.While $465 million would be a small number in comparison to the damage WDC would face if it is cut out of Fab 6, the Lexar precedent is striking because $465 million was about equal to the total enterprise value of Lexar at the time of the trial. Winning that lawsuit set Lexar on a course to finance itself, and ultimately be acquired by Micron.Toshiba was stunned with the verdict in the Lexar case. Toshiba no doubt has executives with painful institutional knowledge of just how far off-the-rails this kind of corporate litigation can go-- and how damaging it can be for Toshiba to bet its future on a remote of trier of fact--whether the adjudicator is a judge, a jury or (as in this case) a panel of arbitrators.Moreover Toshiba made the same kind of spurious arguments in the Lexar case that it is making here--that it was entitled to unilaterally abdicate the deal after Toshiba had obtained the IP goodies from the relationship. Toshiba was found to have damaged Lexar by making indefensible pre-textual efforts to maneuver Lexar out of benefit of its bargain. Lexar had transferred and disclosed key technology to Toshiba under a promise of partnership, and then Toshiba had taken advantage of that technology and pulled the rug out, once Lexar had become dependent on Toshiba for supply.The lesson from the Lexar case is clear: when a big global company forms a partnership that both parties are dependent on, and then uses weak pretexts like “you didn’t approve that document I sent you as fast as I asked, so I am hereby terminating all your rights and cutting you out of the deal”, such positions are likely to be crisply rejected. Moreover, such legal positions may also form the basis for a finding of bad faith and breach of fiduciary duty.2) WDC’s rights to block Toshiba’s sale to any third party are on their face absolute and unequivocal.Toshiba is unlikely to prevail in circumventing this contractual blocking right.WDC has already had strong initial success in getting a temporary restraining order on the sale of the JV by Toshiba. Indeed, it should come as no surprise that it has had that success because the contract in question is crystal clear on the right of either party to block a sale of the JV by the other party.The relevant agreements are publicly filed with the SEC as Exhibits to SanDisk’s 10-Q, filed November 8, 2006. These agreements may be reviewed by investors and their counsel: here, here and here. While the agreements are complex, the provisions prohibiting a sale without consent are simple and incontrovertible.The most important agreement is called the Flash Alliance Master Agreement, which states that it is explicitly governed by California law. The agreement expressly states:Ownership Interest. Except as otherwise expressly permitted by the FA Operating Agreement and this Agreement, [each party] shall not Transfer or permit any of its Affiliates to Transfer all or any portion of its FA Shares (or all or any portion of its interest in any Affiliate through which it beneficially owns its FA Shares), to any Person without the consent of the other Party. The agreement also has the following strenuous prohibition on assignment:Lawyers and business people familiar with contracts might normally expect to see softening language such as “such consent not to be unreasonably withheld” or some other similar tempering language. Here, we find the exact opposite. The agreement provides an absolute bar (“sole discretion”), and the contract gives WDC the right to object for any reason.Indeed, it makes perfect sense that Sandisk/WDC should have such rights. At the time they put this deal together, SanDisk was the leading technology company in the NAND space, the holder of the key trade secrets, patents and domain knowledge. It had tested and proven out its core patents in litigation with Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and others.Like some technology pioneers and leaders in other fields, SanDisk had invented much of the core technology that is the basis for modern non-volatile memory. It was a leader in the design of NAND cells, in subsystems, in interfaces and in related software.SanDisk had every right to insist in that negotiation that if it turned over all of those crown jewels to a manufacturing partner through a joint venture, the partner could not turn around and sell that JV to another player who might try to frustrate SanDisk’s supply, run the JV for the benefit of a competitor or fail to protect the technology. It had every right to insist on these protections, and it in fact did insist on these protections. That’s the bargain that parties negotiated, that’s the bargain that Toshiba agreed to. A deal is a deal, inconvenient though it may be for Toshiba’s current objectives at this stage.Now Toshiba is trying to do throw all of that in the trash, without giving SanDisk/WDC the opportunity to approve the deal, to participate in the buyout or even to protect its source of supply.This action is not likely to find a sympathetic ear in any court or arbitration panel. WDC knows this, and Toshiba knows it as well. For this reason, Toshiba has raised this posture for negotiation purposes only, and will be looking for a way to back down and resolve this dispute.3) Toshiba’s effort to blow up WDC’s rights is an attempt to work a forfeiture. Law students in the United States have learned by heart the black letter law that “The Law Abhors Forfeiture.“ This principle is based on the simple logic that courts or other adjudicators interpreting a contract try to do the least violence to the purposes of a contract by trying to interpret the agreements in a way to preserve the benefit of the bargain for both parties. It is inequitable to find that a small delay, a ""gotcha"" or technical foot-fault violation of some clause or other should cause one party to have its contract benefits ripped away. Technical violations, even serious ones, do not cause courts to tear up the whole agreement. There are long-standing principles of jurisprudence that require courts to strain to find the existence of a binding agreement, and to enforce it, rather than to dissolve the agreement.Of all the kinds of breaches, the ones that are least likely to cause the extreme remedy of forfeiture is the kind of gimmick that Toshiba is trying here--arguing that someone didn’t agree to some time schedule or plan served up by one party to another in the course of business, or failed to comply with some notice provision. The law is clear that any waiver of serious contractual rights must be clear, intentional and unequivocal. Missing a deadline (even if WDC did so) is not enough to declare a waiver or forfeiture.Here, WDC has actually approved the investment in the JV. It has publicly stated its willingness and intention to fund its share of Fab 6, and its Board of Directors has approved that commitment. There is no way that a court or arbitration panel is going to look at that set of facts and say: “Toshiba should get a giant windfall, WDC forfeits all its rights, because WDC didn’t immediately approve some demand, some schedule or some document furnished by Toshiba.”Not gonna happen. Surprising as it may be to many people, business courts and arbitration panels tend to get it right. They look for just and fair outcomes that do as little violence as possible to the business expectations of the parties determined at the time they entered the contract. Such an outcome is not in the cards, and Toshiba’s lawyers are no doubt telling Toshiba this. Thus, this is a negotiation ploy, nothing more. 4) Toshiba is going to find it impossible to consummate a sale of its memory business without resolving this dispute.At this point, Toshiba appears to be seeking to exclude WDC from participating in the sale of its JV. In doing so, Toshiba is negotiating with both competitors of WDC and with private equity funds, such as Bain Capital. Plainly, this is not what was intended when the parties formed their irrevocable joint venture and linked their future together.Professionals who have experience in mergers and acquisitions in the technology industry know something about this kind of deal: none of those buyers are going to close into this uncertainty. They may posture that they will do so They may hang around the hoop waiting for a resolution. But actually closing into massive litigation, that has the possibility of unwinding your deal and causing it to be onerous in some way, or even not legally valid? No way. Those PE funds and public companies are fiduciaries to their investors.Even if they were somehow willing to assume such massive legal risk, PE buyers need debt capital, and those debt agreements require clean legal opinions as to legal enforceability. None of those prospective buyers are going to suck up the contingent liability of WDC’s claim, and risk buying a company that has a crippling liability, or even uncertain rules as to its operations. At least not without a massive discount, which Toshiba can not afford.Finally, it is notable that Toshiba has so little confidence in this negotiating tactic that it has not actually taken a position on the record. No Toshiba employee is on record, at least as of yet, signing their name publicly to the position that Toshiba believes it has credible and valid legal right to cut WDC off from its supply.This silence was noted by a Stifle research analyst published on Friday August 4, which wrote: “It is hard to ascertain the validity of what is being said [by Toshiba] given that today’s report by Bloomberg is not accompanied by a corporate press release”The dominant theme here is that Toshiba needs to resolve this. WDC plainly wants to resolve it as well, and as a WDC shareholder, I hope it gets done. However, for Toshiba getting this dispute resolved quickly is an absolute necessity. For this reason, WDC is in the position to drive to resolve this negotiation in a fair and equitable way.CONCLUSIONInvestors in public technology companies must of course learn to live with the fat tails of legal risk. Investors in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have to accept some minor tail risk that Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) will win its IP claim against Apple. Investors in Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) have to live with the tail risk that the European Union will impair its future operations. The tail risks are endless. That’s life in the big city. Somehow, we all learn to live with these risks without marking our investments down to PE multiples of 7.The risk to WDC is being overvalued, and WDC is trading at an unjustifiable discount to its intrinsic value. And that discount means opportunity to those who hear it knocking.WDC is just too cheap. It has great management. Its business is doing well, and its strategic position is excellent.Opportunity says: knock knock.

4100593,102404,2017-08-21T08:17:05-04:00,"At least according to non-GAAP earnings per share, Western Digital has an extremely low P/E ratio - especially for a company that will grow over the next years.From a technical standpoint, a correction of the last bullish wave would not be surprising at all.The high debt levels and the unresolved dispute with Toshiba are two reasons for concern.Despite some uncertainties, Western Digital still seems to be undervalued and is a buy at current price levels.","A little over a year ago, Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) seemed to be in big trouble and was almost hated by investors. Since then, the headlines were dominated by increasing revenue, increasing earnings as well as the regular beating of analysts' expectations and a climbing stock. But since a few months, the positive information about earnings are repressed by a spiral of never-ending information about a legal dispute with Toshiba Corporation (OTCPK:TOSBF) that seems to be far from getting resolved. In the last few weeks, this also seemed to have a negative effect on the stock price, and the question right now is: Should investors take the chance and buy the dip or rather stay away.In order to decide if a company is a worthy investment, we always look at important financial information and some numbers like revenue, book value or margins. By just looking at the numbers, Western Digital seems to be a great company and a definite buy:While according to GAAP accounting standards the diluted earnings per share were only $1.34, on a non-GAAP basis, the diluted earnings per share for 2017 were $9.19. The P/E is currently 8.7, and Western Digital seems to be deeply undervalued. For 2018, earnings per share are expected to be between $11.98 and $12.28 (according to Morningstar), which would lead to a forward P/E of 6.7.Despite all the positive numbers, WDC seems to be in a bearish mode for a few weeks already, and the stock has declined from $95 to about $80. The obvious reason for this decline seems to be the above-mentioned dispute with Toshiba that is dominating the headlines. As there seems to be no solution for the conflict between the two companies on the horizon, this creates a high level of uncertainty, and investors certainly don’t like uncertainty.There is however another reason for the decline, which is not discussed so widely, but should nonetheless be no surprise for investors. We all know that markets move in two (or three) different directions: Stocks can rise and fall (or move sideways) leading to wave patterns where a bullish wave is followed by a correctional bearish wave. In May 2016, WDC marked a temporary low point and has since then climbed to $95.80 (July 21, 2017). In only 14 months, the stock gained 174% without a major correction - only at the very beginning there was one 20% correction. And after such a long bullish wave, a steeper correction that might last longer than just a few weeks should not come as a surprise.From a technical perspective, it is possible that the 200-day simple moving average (red line) as well as the 200-day exponential moving average (green line) are already at a support level and the stock won’t drop any further. But it is also possible that we will see a steeper correction and the stock might drop to $72.50 where we find the lows of February and March 2017 and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement line (meaning the stock has corrected 38.2% of the former bullish wave).Source: TraderFox Trading-Desk - 8.000 Aktien und Realtimekurse weltweit in Echtzeit!Short-term oriented traders could use a possible setback to initiate new long positions in WDC, as from a technical standpoint, the next bullish upward wave could follow, but I rather want to analyze if long-term investors should also buy the stock at this point. The mostly bullish picture presented above is affected negatively by two concerning aspects that need to be examined more closely:One reason for concern is the high debt levels. For the acquisition of SanDisk in 2016, Western Digital issued new debt, and the current long-term debt is $12,918 million. Although the debt levels could be reduced over the last quarters, WDC still has a D/E ratio of 1.17, which is usually considered as being a little too high. The non-GAAP operating income of Western Digital was $3,932 million in the last year, and operating income according to GAAP was $1,954 million in the same time period. If we use ""just"" the GAAP operating income and assume it will not grow over the next seven years, WDC will generate an operating income of $13,678 million until 2024. As the current long-term debt is $12,918 million right now, it will be enough to cover all the outstanding debt. About $4.1 billion of that debt is due in 2021 and the rest (about $9 billion) is due in 2023 or 2024. Although we can expect that WDC is able to pay back the debt from its operating income of the next seven years, the company currently also has $6,354 million in cash and cash equivalents (money that could be used for necessary interest payments until 2024).Although currently there seems to be no reason to worry, we have to think about the possibility that Western Digital will win the bidding for Toshiba’s chip unit. As this is part of the ongoing dispute between the two companies, I will analyze this matter in more detail in the next chapter. For now, there is only one important number: $18 billion. According to different information, this is currently the highest bid coming from a consortium of Bain Capital and the Japanese government (also matched by Western Digital). To pay for the acquisition, WDC would have to issue new debt of at least $12 billion as it only has $6.35 billion in cash. This would increase the outstanding debt to $25 billion, and although WDC could issue debt that is not due for 20 or even 30 years, we are talking about high debt levels that can be dangerous for a company. The D/E ratio would be 2.19, and the company would need about 6.4 times its current annual non-GAAP operating income to pay back the debt.We also have to consider the interest payments. For the debt WDC issued in 2016, it has to pay interest rates between 7% and 10.5%, and we can assume that for newly issued debt, the company has to pay similar interest rates. In the following chart, we present three different scenarios to find out how long it would take WDC to repay all of the outstanding debt.Source: Own workIn the first scenario, we assume that WDC could increase the operating income 5% a year and we also assume stable dividend payments ($2 per share per year). Considering interest payments of 10% annually, WDC could pay back the debt until 2027. Even if we assume increasing dividend payments (10% a year), WDC can still pay back all outstanding debt until 2027 (scenario III). In the last scenario (scenario II), we assume the worst case: WDC is not able to increase operating income and therefore won't increase any dividend payments. In this case, it will take until 2032 for WDC to repay all of its debt.After we have found out that it would take no longer than till 2032 for WDC to repay the debt, we have to focus on the dispute with Toshiba, because WDC will only have such high outstanding debt if the dispute can be resolved and it will buy Toshiba’s chip unit. Currently investors are not worried about high debt levels, but because of the ongoing dispute between Western Digital and Toshiba, that turned uglier and uglier as the weeks progressed. Nevertheless, Stephan D. Milligan stated during the earnings call, that:It is true that Toshiba and SanDisk worked side by side - and obviously very successful. As Western Digital bought SanDisk last year, they are now in a joint venture with Toshiba and operate a semiconductor plant in Japan. Toshiba is in some trouble right now and it wants to sell its chip unit and Western Digital is among the bidders (as already stated above, a consortium of Bain Capital and the Japanese government is currently bidding $18 billion, but Western Digital matched that bid). Because of its joint venture with Toshiba, WDC demands exclusive negotiating rights and that it has the right to block any bidder Toshiba might pick. On May 9, 2017, Toshiba told Western Digital to stop interfering in plans to sell its memory chip unit and warned that it may take legal actions, and right now, Toshiba is suing Western Digital for $1 billion because of the damages WDC has caused in interfering with the sale of its memory chip division. On July 11, 2017, a Californian court also issued a restraining order that was extended on August 7, 2017. Western Digital obviously still wants to invest in a new memory chip production line along with Toshiba, but Toshiba announced that it will go ahead with its $1.8 billion investment to build the Fab 6 equipment line without Western Digital.As I am no lawyer, I am really not capable of providing additional information about who will win this dispute, and I am definitely not able to interpret the JV contracts. There are however already a few articles on SA that discuss the legal aspects. An article why Western Digital Holds The Best Cards In The Toshiba Negotiation by Technology Equity Strategies, and a second article, Why Western Digital Will Prevail In The Legal Battle With Toshiba Over The JV by Sunil Shah provide valuable additional information on the matter. Although I don’t know how this litigation will end, I think that Western Digital is in a better position than Toshiba as Toshiba’s current state is much more dramatic.On August 10, 2017, Toshiba temporarily avoided a delisting from the Tokyo stock exchange, and as the company desperately needs money, it seems more important for it to sell its chip unit (to bring its own company back on track) than for Western Digital to buy the chip unit. And since Western Digital has a 49% stake, the highest bidder who is buying the chip unit has to cooperate with Western Digital in the future, which could - considering the current development - be rather difficult. It would therefore be no surprise if other bidders for the chip unit might be hesitant to close the deal.Although the debt is manageable and we are pretty convinced that Western Digital will come out on top in the dispute with Toshiba, we still have to factor in a high margin of safety in our intrinsic value calculation to account for the uncertainties.If we use the free cash flow of the last four quarters ($2,249 million) and assume a growth rate of 5% per year for the next decade (definitely realistic), Western Digital seems still undervalued - despite the bullish rally during the last 14 months. Calculating with a 10% discount rate, the intrinsic value of Western Digital would be $129.89. Since it seems rather difficult to decide how the dispute between Toshiba and Western Digital could end and because of the high debt levels (especially if Western Digital could take over Toshiba’s chip unit), it is important for us to assume a high margin of safety to compensate. To take these uncertainties into account, I think a 25% margin of safety is high enough to compensate for these risks and Western Digital is therefore still a buy as long as the price stays below $97.In my last article on Western Digital, I came to the conclusion that Western Digital is only fairly valued (about $90 at that time). Back then I mainly focused on the GAAP results which led me to a more conservative intrinsic value calculation. Now I also considered the non-GAAP results that lead to a more bullish picture. Should Western Digital decline to $70 or $75, I would call Western Digital a bargain and you should follow the advice of David Tepper who increased his stake in Western Digital - as well as Micron (NASDAQ:MU). But even at current levels, Western Digital still seems to be an undervalued stock and a buy despite the dispute with Toshiba and the high debt levels.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The alternative, arbitration could take two years.Western Digital is about to become the most strategic digital storage company in the world, including a pole position in NAND memory, the new cement of the digital information highway.","After a six-month convalescence to recover physically from a relentless decade of tennis at the topmost level, Roger Federer returned to Wimbledon. Many doubted that his 36-year-old body could withstand the physical hardship, match after match, day after day for an entire two weeks. Roger stunned the doubters into silence, winning the entire championship without dropping a single set. In my mind, he’s secured his place in history as the greatest tennis player of all time.Western Digital Management must also feel they have been through a battle in the last few weeks, as the acrimonious legal wrangling with Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) came to a head. For detail on the importance of Toshiba Memory (TM) and the jewel FV (Flash Ventures) within it, please see my previous article here. For detail on the watertight legal case WDC holds on securing TM or at a minimum ensuring who acquires it, please see my article here.On 14th July, a court hearing in San Francisco ended with a judge ordering WDC and its joint-venture partner Toshiba to return on July 28th. During the hearing for Western’s request for a preliminary injunction against Toshiba, Judge Harold Kahn of the Superior Court of California for the County of San Francisco proposed an order for the two sides to agree to, but he ultimately told both parties to return to the court on the 28th to discuss the matter further. Note that this date coincides with another important event: Western Digital also is contesting its consent rights in an international arbitration tribunal, and this will first be heard on July 28th also. As with any legal partial outcome, both companies had their own interpretation.Toshiba’s Interpretation: WDC’s Interpretation: My Interpretation:Judge Kahn demonstrated incredible wisdom here. He didn’t enforce the injunction but asked the parties to agree on a wording that was mutually acceptable. Honourable Kahn is fully aware that an arbitration process is set to begin on July 28, and that’s the date he set for the parties to agree. This basically secures the deal for WDC as an arbitration process would take at least a year, and it’s a year that beleaguered Toshiba doesn’t have – its severely disgruntled shareholders already want blood due to a series of monumental blunders by Toshiba’s management, and a year’s delay would almost guarantee Toshiba’s delisting.In my opinion, Toshiba is virtually compelled to come to a transaction agreement in principle, and since WDC has already secured a right of veto on who will be the acquirer, this paves the way for TM into WDC’s fold.Note that WDC has already matched the highest bid on offer, as far as the terms have been made public. There is no material reason for Toshiba to resist.What Does Toshiba Memory Encompass? One of the most perplexing things about this saga is that we still don’t know precisely what TM encompasses. A division in Toshiba called ""Storage and Electronic Devices"" is the main unit up for sale, but there are elements within it that Toshiba intends to retain. Despite the myriad of suitors and despite scouring all relevant legal documents, it’s still not entirely clear to me precisely what Toshiba has put up for sale.Toshiba’s Annual report reveals what this entity represents:This is my best guesstimate:-50.1% of the Joint Venture with WDC (via SanDisk), which WDC calls Flash Ventures (FV) and Toshiba calls BiCS Flash, is sold. This produces the wafer and converts it into NAND memory-The land and buildings that this JV operates from is sold-The HDD business in Toshiba is retained.-There is substantial skill and equipment that uses NAND memory to produce devices that fit into Toshiba’s other divisions, ie automotive, industrial, infrastructure, power generation, etc. We don’t know how much is sold and retained. This leads to the next piece in the puzzle.Why Toshiba is so reluctant to sell to WDC?Toshiba would become dangerously dependent on WDC for the NAND (now captive), as Toshiba has significant expertise to use that NAND as a key input and convert it into the numerous devices that slide into Toshiba's other divisions. However, WDC via SanDisk possesses that same expertise and could easily displace the value-add capability Toshiba intends to keep. This is why, in my opinion, Toshiba almost is acting insanely to prevent the sale to WDC. And that’s why WDC will have to provide Toshiba additional assurances on supplying NAND to Toshiba as a precondition of the sale of TM.ConclusionA game set match victory is almost inevitable for WDC.With the one exception that Foxconn (with its mighty ally Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the only other potential contender, raises the bid in the next two weeks. This is not outside the realms of possibility. However, I believe the enshrined rights that WDC holds on transfer of ownership of FV will prevail, even if WDC is obliged to match the higher ensuing bid.Once the details of the deal (exactly what is being sold from the Toshiba division called ""Storage and Electronic Devices"") are fully divulged the market will realize the incredible value placed on FV, of which WDC already owns half. I estimate that 50% of FV will comprise about $14bn of the $20bn price tag touted for TM. Note that WDC already owns the other half of FV, and this will draw investors to WDC. Remember WDC paid a net $13bn for SanDisk in May '16, and FV was estimated to represent at most $8bn of that deal. Now its imputed value, via the coming TM transaction may be as high as $14bn. The path is virtually set (tennis pun intended) to acquire Toshiba Memory, with beleaguered Toshiba seeing no other alternative for a swift resolution that would avoid its delisting. I have the highest conviction that WDC is a strong buy.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4093185,21702,2017-08-01T13:04:56-04:00,"The two largest domestic hard disk drive manufacturers appear to have diverging futures.Western Digital's strategic takeover of San Disk gives it a big advantage (i.e. NAND) over Seagate.As a result, Western Digital will use that advantage to hit Seagate where it hurts: HDD margins.","According to IDC, the global hard disk drive (or HDD) storage market is dominated by three companies: Toshiba (TOSBY), Western Digital (NYSE:WDC), and Seagate Technology (STX):For full-year 2016, Western Digital retained the No. 1 spot in terms of both total unit sales and total petabytes shipped. That said, both Toshiba and Seagate nibbled away at WDC's market share as shown in the graphic above. But from the larger perspective, the HDD market exhibited flat year-over-year revenue growth and declining unit volumes.The real action is in the solid state disk (or SSD) market where companies that have NAND manufacturing capability (i.e. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Toshiba, and Western Digital) have a distinct advantage over those that do not. Which is why you don't see Seagate listed among the leaders in SSD market share:Western Digital's bold move to acquire SanDisk last year gave it an immediate and significant presence in the SSD market. It is second only to Samsung in SSD's and a few percentage points ahead of No. 3 Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).So what happens to Seagate Technology going forward? My guess is the company will face (and is already facing) increasing margin pressure on its HDD product offerings as Western Digital is able to flex its muscles in the NAND market and offer compelling and total system level solutions (i.e. a mix of NAND, SSD, and HDD technology) for the rich and growing cloud and enterprise markets.The diverging futures of the two companies were exhibited in the recent Q2 (fiscal Q4) EPS reports (see STX, WDC). Comparisons of slides from the two companies' quarterly presentations are informative:Source: Seagate's Quarterly Supplemental InformationSource: Western Digital Quarterly Fact SheetQuarter-over-quarter Seagate's revenue and EPS were down, the later down sharply. Gross margin was 27.7%.For WDC, quarter over quarter revenue was up, and EPS of $0.93/share was up from $0.83 in the prior quarter. On the quarterly conference call, WDC reported non-GAAP gross margin of 41% - up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter and up 950 basis points year-over-year. And this will be Seagate's problem going forward - and WDC will be the beneficiary.As a result, the YTD stock performance of the two companies are diverging, with WDC headed up, Seagate headed down:Source: Google FinanceI suspect this stock divergence between the two companies to continue based on the strength of WDC's strategic positioning in NAND, and therefore in the SSD market.Summary and ConclusionDon't fall for Seagate's dividend yield (7.6%) vs. WDC's (2.3%). The companies are headed in opposite directions. While the Toshiba NAND sale narrative changes on a near daily basis, the fact is that WDC's position in the Toshiba joint venture puts them at an advantage against any other potential suitor. And while the stock prices of both STX and WDC declined after the quarterly results were released, WDC's stock declined in the face of a beat and full-year earnings guidance of $12/share. I reiterate my buy rating on WDC. The pullback in the stock is a great buying opportunity for those who want to establish a position. WDC could eclipse its old high (set back in 2014) by year-end."
4086164,22263,2017-07-06T17:18:37-04:00,"In an article a week ago, I outlined why Western Digital will not rest until their flash JV is acquired from distressed Toshiba.The legal imbroglio has gained momentum, with Toshiba asking a US court to dismiss Western Digital’s injunction.In this article, I review the legal grounding of the Flash Ventures JV initiated 17 years ago between SanDisk and Toshiba.These rights now belong to WDC after the SanDisk acquisition.I examine the legal position of Western Digital: it is unassailable, despite Toshiba’s desperate legal manoeuvres that emanate directly from its beleaguered financial situation. WDC is a strong buy.","In the future of Western Digital (WDC), it is difficult to overemphasize the importance of their JV with Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF). Collectively termed Flash Ventures, the term appears 112 times in their 150 page 2016 Annual Report. WDC currently owns 49.9% of the entity formed in 2006, and Toshiba Corporation owns the remaining 50.1%.WDC will prevail at the California court ruling on July 14th, paving the way for a prompt acquisition of FV. The appeal of WDC is irresistible today, a combination of its current P/E and the promising memory storage outlook.The critical nature of the FV is explicitly stated in a recent court submission to the Supreme Court of California, Declaration of Mark P Long, WDC’s CFO, in support of a SanDisk’s Motion for a preliminary injunction (retrieve by contacting WDC Investor Relations):What is the legal basis for WDC’s rights over Flash Ventures (FV)?These are adequately covered in WDC’s submission to the International Chamber Of Commerce International Court Of Arbitration, dated June 14 (here again please retrieve by contacting WDC Investor Relations), “to remedy Toshiba’s breaches of its agreements with SanDisk prohibiting the transfer of Toshiba’s joint venture interests without SanDisk’s prior consent and to prevent Toshiba from further breaching these agreements.”Within the legal documents, there is an elaborate explanation of how Toshiba attempted to transfer the FV to a new entity, Toshiba Memory Company, for the purposes of then transferring those interests to a third party through a public auction. Without having a legal background, this ploy is entirely without merit (may I say hilarious in non-legalese), in a desperate attempt to breach SanDisk’s enshrined rights in FV, by creating a new entity which (miraculously!) would not uphold the detailed and strict JV provisions.The JV Agreements Contain Strict Anti-Transfer Provisions From a legal submission called “Plaintiff SanDisk's Memorandum ISO Preliminary Injunction” which may be retrieved by contacting WDC Investor Relations, The JV Agreements protect SanDisk and Toshiba from being forced into a relationship with parties against their will. The Master Agreements, which are governed by California law, provide: Except as otherwise expressly permitted by the [Operating Agreement] and this Agreement, [each Party] shall not Transfer or permit any of its Affiliates to Transfer all or any portion of its [JV] Shares (or all or any portion of its interest in any Affiliate through which it beneficially owns its [JV] Shares), to any Person without the consent of the other Party.Why did WDC file the injunction in California?The answer is simple: The JV Agreements provide that disputes that cannot be resolved by a dispute resolution process must be settled by binding arbitration in San Francisco, California under the rules of the ICC. SanDisk initiated an arbitration with the ICC on May 15, 2017, and filed an amended arbitration request on June 14. The date for the hearing is set for July 14th. I expect a swift resolution based on the clear merits above and the injunction to prevent the sale to be granted, probably on that very day. For the acutely legal-minded, an excerpt of the relevant case law:Toshiba’s desperate maneuvers may well lead to a forced sale to WDCIn my opinion, Toshiba’s desperate legal wrangling may prove highly detrimental to their interests. They have gone as far as to lock WDC employees out of their joint FAB in Japan.On June 3, 2017, Toshiba’s breach ripened into an Event of Default, entitling SanDisk to buy-out rights under the terms set forth in Section 10.4(A) of the Operating Agreements… if a breach of the anti-transfer provisions of the Master Agreements or Operating Agreements were left uncured for 60 days, an “Event of Default” would occur.My reading of the above is that 60 days after the breach (or around August 3 2017), WDC could charge for a default and force the purchase of the Joint Venture at Book Value! This is a dangerous game Toshiba is playing. According to fellow SA contributor JP Research, the book value is around $1bn, a mere fraction of the touted $20bn.ConclusionOn June 27th, WDC also presented a new bid, coupled with Private Equity firm KKR, giving Toshiba the opportunity of debt financing. This statement from the above press release is key:Although details are not firm on the above announcement, my interpretation is that WDC is willing to take on a debt facility from KKR to facilitate an expeditious sale of FV. This debt will fund the purchase of FV, and WDC will later pursue an equity raising to optimize the financial structure. This would circumvent the SEC hurdles on issuing new equity currently. Problem solved: Toshiba gets much-needed cash immediately, WDC issues new debt provided by KKR and commits to a secondary equity issue in the near future.I have the highest conviction that WDC will prevail, probably as soon as July 14th, when the Supreme Court in San Francisco judges the injunction. The valuation of WDC today, based on $12 EPS for Calendar 2017 sits at 7.5X, or less than half the Market P/E.There is little doubt on the outlook for NAND, where WDC, after the consummation of the JV, will be leading supplier with +35% market share of a highly attractive global NAND memory market.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4087781,102890,2017-07-14T13:14:17-04:00,"Western Digital's legal battle with Toshiba could result in WD acquiring Toshiba's NAND chip unit and add to its 2016 sales figure by up to 50%.Comparable company analysis shows that Western Digital's earnings per share figures are higher than most competitors but that there is still room for WD to grow its market cap.Long-term downside is minimised if demand for chips remains greater than supply, keeping its price high and continuing the rally of chip-based stocks like WDC.","In a previous article, ""Testing Western Digital's Bargaining Power"", I discussed the situation surrounding the sale of Toshiba’s (OTCPK:TOSBF, OTCPK:TOSYY) fabled flash memory unit and why there would be such a significant upside available to whichever company would be able to secure the acquisition. I still believe that Western Digital (WDC) is the most likely to complete the deal - which would in turn help Toshiba salvage a chance to avoid being de-listed from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Today's court hearing will be very telling as to whether Western Digital can gain the upper hand, as the two companies’ lawyers attempt to settle their disputes via the medium of court.On Tuesday, the first blow was dealt to Toshiba, with Western Digital being granted a court order to receive chip samples and gain unrestricted access to its shared databases. However, this is just the beginning of the resolution - the biggest hearing will be held later today, where a decision will be made against the claim that Western Digital is interfering with Toshiba's attempted sale of the flash memory unit. Western Digital owns 49% of the unit already, and it believes that Toshiba's handling of the sale is in breach of the code of conduct for its joint venture. The resulting verdict will likely prove crucial to who prevails in this bidding war, as I will now explain.If the court rules that WD has been interfering in the sale of the unit, then it is possible that Toshiba will get another chance to complete the deal with its favoured consortium of US, South Korean, and Japanese investors. However, there are some complications with this cohort, due to the inclusion of SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) (a rival chip-making company) in the group.On the other hand, if Western Digital wins the legal battle, then the ball will lie firmly in its court; the end result will then almost definitely be WDC and its choice of backing investors securing the final bid and taking over the unit. Recently, Western Digital has made an increased bid to level the playing field and make it the joint highest bidder, which might give it some hope, even if it loses its court appeal.Moving on to some company specific analysis, I will now take a quick look at how Western Digital is valued as a company and what this acquisition could do to its earnings potential and market sentiment, if it is completed.Through the following simple comparable analysis, I have compared WDC’s share price, earnings per share and price-to-earnings ratios to its peer group (composed of fellow microchip-based firms).It is obvious to see that the enormous EPS figures from tech giant, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), are very influential to the group average EPS. The forecasted share price for Western Digital assumes that the company's P/E can grow slightly to match the sector's average and that WDC can bolster its earnings per share figure towards the 16.59 average figure.From this, we can see that there would be significant upside potential for Western Digital's stock if it were able to execute on this earnings growth, with the forecasted share price representing a growth figure of 381% from WDC's current value. However, looking at the enormity of Samsung's EPS figure as compared with those of the other chip-makers, Samsung, like other large tech companies, has achieved these figures through its diverse business model and the ability to tap in to a multitude of revenue streams and marketplaces. There has been a lot of profit to be made from Samsung's semiconductor unit over the last year, but when times have been harder for chips, Samsung has a lot of other assets and revenue streams to rely on. For Western Digital to grow its earnings as forecasted, it would need to adapt a similar model, whereby it would become less prone to the swings in profitability in the chip business.The below chart shows the benefits that Samsung has reaped due to its diversity. Samsung’s stock has grown over the last three years, unfazed by the falling chip prices during 2015, whilst companies such as Micron (MU) that are focused solely on chips have suffered a different fate. This is due to the volatile, commodity-like pricing movements of the cost of the chips, which are based entirely on fundamental supply and demand factors. As explained here, chip stocks (including WDC) have rallied in the previous 12 months because demand has outweighed supply and high chip prices have proved very profitable. But, prior to that, they had been falling for the exact opposite reason.It is hard to predict supply vs. demand for the future of chips. But I expect the current trend of greater demand to continue for the foreseeable future due to the increasing need for chips, for example, in NAND storage for the world's largest companies - among them Nintendo (OTCPK:NTDOY) and Apple (AAPL) - as the tech sector continues to grow.Source: NASDAQNow, we'll look at what the potential acquisition could do for Western Digital. WDC’s annual revenue for fiscal year 2016 was 13 billion USD. In the same period, revenue being generated by Toshiba’s “Electronic Devices & Components” sector stood at 1.6 trillion yen (equal to over 8 billion USD at the current exchange rate). Through the acquisition of Toshiba’s crown jewel in this space, WDC would likely be tapping into the majority of that revenue stream with the potential to, therefore, add up to a 60% revenue increase to its current annual sales figure. This would filter through to the share price of WDC and aid the company in continuously beating earnings estimates.Source: Toshiba Investor RelationsThe below comparative analysis (excluding tech giant Samsung) forecasts a potential share price for Western Digital that is actually 57% lower than its current value. This identifies that the stock may have already outperformed the rest of its chip-making peer group and therefore could be slightly overvalued in its sector. Western Digital's current higher pricing can be justified as long as WDC is able to provide continuing growth, but this may be harder to come by if it fails to complete the Toshiba acquisition.In conclusion, I believe that Western Digital will fare well from this week's court proceedings, and I am bullish on the stock. I see Friday’s hearing as crucial in the flash memory unit’s exchange, and I am optimistic about Western Digital's chances. Following the decision, if WDC is able to complete this acquisition, then I believe that it will mark the beginning of Western Digital’s growth into a larger tech company and aid in the continuation of the current rally that the WDC stock has been enjoying.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4128971,101850,2017-12-01T12:01:54-05:00,Toshiba's latest capital raise is a game changer - a Toshiba Memory sale doesn't make financial sense anymore.WDC still holds significant legal and IP leverage.Expect legal and delisting risks to de-escalate.WDC's stock is pricing in an irrational discount - great time to accumulate in the high 70s.Toshiba also looks attractively priced - accumulate.,"Event related plays have always been fascinating to me for the simple reason that they have not happened yet. With acquisition related plays for instance, conventional thinking tends to point toward a binary black/ white outcome - sell or no sell. But it's really the grey that swings the P/L. And I think this is looking to be the case in the latest inning of the Toshiba Memory saga.Only two months ago, some here were proclaiming a done deal - that Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) would sell its memory unit to Bain and that would be that. Not so, in my view. As things have panned out, Toshiba has repeatedly cited contingency plans, hidden a contractual escape clause, announced a JPY600bn capital raise (diluting its shareholder base to the tune of 35%) along with a number of asset disposals which will allow it to forego a sale entirely. The numbers support this view - Toshiba is likely to stay put and remain listed regardless.Assuming this scenario prevails, a non-sale (binary black/ white outcome) will have zero accretion to Western Digital's (WDC) financials. There is grey though - should it return the multiple back to historical levels (~11x), this equates to $143 (~77% upside) on solid fundamentals.Meanwhile, Toshiba at these levels still prices in some degree of delisting risk which seems out of the question at this point, while a non-sale event (~81% upside) has not been priced in at all by the market.Recent dips in both stocks are great opportunities to accumulate.Since my last update, we've seen a major swing in the balance of negotiating power away from Western Digital (WDC) toward Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF). This has kept WDC range bound around the mid-80s to low 90s (before the recent dip back to the 70s) as a deal with Bain was announced.Below is a (lengthy) timeline of events since my September update.(* denotes key Memory sale events/ announcements, Bold denotes indications of a failed FY3/18 sale close)My high level takeaways from the Toshiba Memory event timeline are as follows - 1) Toshiba was never going to make the FY3/18 deadline, 2) But the capital raise completely mitigates delisting risk, and 3) Hence, WDC loses some negotiating leverage in the form of Toshiba's time constraints.Sounds bad on paper but digging deeper, a non-sale actually benefits WDC and should lift the overhang on its multiple. As I'll delve into later on, WDC's current legal/ negotiating leverage is misunderstood and the market is irrationally penalizing shares. The 6% dip presents a compelling opportunity to accumulate heavily discounted WDC shares at ~6.2x FY2018E PE (assuming $13.00 FY18E consensus EPS).As I've reiterated numerous times in my prior articles, Western Digital's legal case is watertight. My position on this has only gotten stronger as the courtroom battles grow in volume and intensify. As recent history will show, Sandisk/ Western Digital has ultimately won the courtroom battle not once, not twice but on every occasion both parties have had a legal dispute.If the legal proof isn't enough, consider the number of occasions when Toshiba has tried to coerce Western Digital into waiving its consent rights or wiggle its way out of its legal bind.The latest attempt to battle it out on home ground (Tokyo) instead seems pointless - there are no exceptions in the anti-transfer provision in the Master Agreements, which are governed by California law. Additionally, Toshiba has already implicitly accepted California jurisdiction post the Superior Court of California's July 28th ruling and then in the Sept 8 ruling, when the Superior Court of California explicitly stated that it had jurisdiction.Now that the three person arbitration panel (approved in late Oct) is approved, we're heading into a full arbitration tribunal process which could take ~2 years for full resolution. As I'll elaborate later on, delisting risk is now moot, removing the time constraint on Toshiba. But closing the Bain deal will not only remain a challenge but it will also mean foregoing significant upside for Toshiba.In the meantime, Western Digital will file for injunctive relief to block the sale process with a decision expected in 1H '18.In early October, Western Digital published a fascinating 9 page Q&A document clarifying its position in the Toshiba Memory saga. Of note, it clarified a key misconception Toshiba has been spreading around IP contribution in the Western Digital-Toshiba JV.Per the Q&A:(Source: Western Digital Q&A)Remember the fuss Toshiba made about JV access when Western Digital asserted its contract rights? Here's a quote (one of many) from Toshiba's legal team:And here's a quick refresher of the Toshiba database access case:Note the reiteration of IP rights by Toshiba's legal team to paint the impression that WDC (and by implication, Sandisk) was a mere tag along while Toshiba did the heavy lifting i.e. design, development etc. The reality, as Western Digital stated in its Q&A report, is that SanDisk/WDC had twice Toshiba Memory's US patents with over half of those related to Flash design and manufacturing. The swift and absolute manner of WDC's legal win (WDC's TRO was granted within 5 days) is testament to its IP contribution.IP leverage is a big deal because it gives Western Digital significant leverage in Fab 6 negotiations. Recall that Toshiba had effectively threatened a unilateral investment in Fab 6, cutting off WDC's supply from the facility. Supply disruption from Fab 6 extends to 2029 and would on paper, prove a key obstacle in its ability to meet bit target growth rate of 35-45% for 2019.But for all of Toshiba's posturing, the reality is that Toshiba cannot proceed with manufacturing 3D NAND Flash without Western Digital/ Sandisk's IP.Per WDC's Q&A report:WDC/Toshiba is in the midst of a crucial transition from 64-Layer (BiCS3) to subsequent 96-Layer (BiCS4) 3D NAND and IP-related disruptions would set them back considerably in the 3D NAND race.If that isn't enough of a hindrance, their contractual agreement definitely will be. Per WDC, "" Toshiba is contractually prohibited from working with other companies to manufacture BiCS or other NAND flash memory being developed or manufactured in the SanDisk-Toshiba JVs.""To me, that's about as clear cut as it gets. WDC's IP leverage through Sandisk is very solid and threats of a unilateral investment in Fab 6 are most likely posturing on Toshiba's part to coerce Western Digital into giving up their consent rights.From a legal perspective, Sandisk's IP contribution strengthens its case for injunctive relief as 1) SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) has a checkered history with respect to IP theft and 2) Seagate (STX) is a direct competitor - potential IP leaks and a larger SSD presence will threaten WDC's competitive advantage.In late October, we got our first insight into Toshiba Memory's post Bain business strategies (they had stopped releasing these earnings following a suspension during the aftermath of the Toshiba accounting scandal).The financials were astonishing. Revenues were guided up ~30% for CY2017 while operating profit were on track to double (+99% YoY) at ~32% OP margin. Toshiba Memory expects revenue of JPY1.16tn, operating profit of JPY371bn, and will spend capex of JPY400bn (prior capex was ~JPY200bn) for the year.(Source: Toshiba)Just to put the memory performance into perspective, let's start with a breakdown of Toshiba's revenue - ~35% of total revenue comes from the storage & electronic devices segment (its biggest driver) while its other segments trail slightly in scale.(Source: JPM)But none of its ancillary businesses actually generate much profit. In FY2017, the storage and electronic devices unit contributed 91% of the company's operating profit. The only other profitable business - industrial ICT was barely breaking even.(Source: JPM)Applying what Toshiba disclosed about TMC - 32% OP margins, JPY371.2bn OP, it's quite clear that the memory business is carrying the entire company on its own. Minus the JPY371bn contribution to OP, FY17 would have been another severe loss making year for Toshiba and a delisting would have been a given.(Source: JPM)The removal of Toshiba shares from the TSE's on-alert list was a key event for one key reason - it opened up equity funding options for the company. Realizing the inevitability of a Bain deal falling short of the FY3/18 target, Toshiba management moved to ""Plan B"" - a JPY600bn capital raise. This would be raised through the issuance of new shares.The indicative price will be ~¥262.8 (4.8% below 30 November close) with issuance of 2,283.1 million new shares - i.e. boosting the share count by 54% and diluting existing shareholders by ~35%.(Source: Author Estimates)The capital raise will be completed on 5 December, providing net proceeds after fees of ¥574bn. The funds will be used to make full payment of company guarantees related to WEC (specifically the Vogtle and V.C.Summer AP1000 nuclear projects).In the context of delisting, the JPY600bn lifeline is a game changer. In fact, subsequently selling the business now and obtaining a surplus equity position looks a lot less appealing given 1) ""new"" Toshiba post memory sale will have little if any earnings power and 2) current valuations at JPY2tn actually undervalues the memory unit's earning potential.With the additional JPY600bn on the books, Toshiba will have its share of options. Here's an illustrative table mapping out how easily Toshiba can now turn its negative equity position positive.(Source: UBS)Notice that of all the possible memory unit sale scenarios, Toshiba's equity position remains in positive territory regardless - even if the sale completely fell through. The reason for this sudden shift is threefold - 1) the JPY600bn capital raise boosts June 2017's ~ -JPY619bn equity position virtually into positive territory already, 2) by settling WEC related obligations to creditors, Toshiba would be able to obtain the right vis-a-vis Westinghouse to demand reimbursement of the amount paid by Toshiba, and 3) this then leads to a scenario where Toshiba can then sell its claims, including reimbursement, against WEC and interest held by it related to WEC to a third party and realize tax benefits accordingly.This brings us to the sale of Toshiba's memory unit to the Bain consortium. Contrary to what most think, this deal is far from done. In fact, I think the JPY600bn raise has altered things so materially, it doesn't make financial sense for Toshiba to proceed with the sale any longer.And even if it does, the March deadline is long gone. A June close would seem far more realistic.As things stand, Toshiba will invest ~JPY350bn in the Pangea SPV (set up for Toshiba's memory unit acquisition) and retain a large 40% common equity interest, although economic interest will be sub 30% (~27.6% est). The presence of Hynix (IP theft) and Seagate (direct competitor) will not sit well with Western Digital - expect this to be a key point of contention at arbitration and WDC's filing for injunctive relief.Keeping a portion of Toshiba Memory on the books and earning affiliate income contributions from TMC will support earnings going forward and presents some good upside (~16%) if current NAND supply/demand dynamics do not drastically falter.But here's where it starts to get interesting - if Toshiba retained 100% of its memory unit, applying Micron's (MU) ~5.5x EV/ EBIT multiple would yield ~81% upside from current levels.Toshiba, it would seem, agrees with a no sale scenario. Looking through Toshiba Memory's Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) indicates no penalty at all if Toshiba were to terminate the deal. In fact, Toshiba can terminate the agreement in the (likely) event that the transfer of Toshiba Memory shares is not completed by 31 March 2018. A contractual escape clause for the seller, while buyers have to wait until June to terminate (JPY10bn penalty if they do).Toshiba also discloses required antitrust approvals from the following key jurisdictions - Brazil, China, the European Union, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Philippines, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United States. If getting all those approvals within the next 3-4 months wasn't tough enough, Tsinghua's objection to the TMC sale will make MOFCOM the key hurdle in a process already running severely short of time.Couple that with a potential WDC injunction and the government's (INCJ/DBJ) reluctance to participate upfront, and you have a deal just waiting to fall through.If a deal does indeed collapse or drastically change in form, I expect we'll see a move towards settlement between both parties. I think game theory is a particularly useful way to frame how negotiations have gone so far. Consider the diagram below.With an impending memory unit sale, neither WDC nor Toshiba is incentivized to compromise as the outcome is binary - one wins and the other loses. But if neither side compromises, we arrive at the worst possible outcome, and this seems to be what WDC is pricing in at the moment.But take the memory unit sale out of the equation and the situation changes dramatically. Without a sale, there is simply nothing to compromise on. We simply move back to the status quo (0,0) set of outcomes where both parties are now incentivized to compromise given their legal bind to one another and the lack of financial incentive at hand.Assuming this scenario prevails, a non-sale (binary black/ white outcome) will have zero accretion to Western Digital's financials. There is grey though - should it return the multiple back to historical levels (~11x), this equates to $143 (~77% upside) on solid fundamentals.Meanwhile, Toshiba at these levels still prices in some degree of delisting risk which seems out of the question at this point, while a non-sale event (~81% upside) has not been priced in at all by the market.Recent dips in both stocks are great opportunities to accumulate.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

The outpaced recovery was partially owed to better memory/NAND pricing, which contributed to gross margins in the past quarter, and helped boost revenues as well.Clearly, we’re witnessing a different Micron from prior year, and with sentiment at new highs we examine industry data points, and whether recent growth trends are sustainable.The firm reported record revenue of $5.57 billion, and non-GAAP dil. EPS of $1.62 per share. This compared to consensus expectations of $5.41 billion and $1.51, respectively.The expectation beat was above consensus on revenue, which grew 20% q/q and 92% y/y (arguably the most important metric for growth oriented investors).What drove results was heightened gross margins, CNBU (Computer and Networking Business Unit), better pricing, and increases to industry market share due to competitive pricing and various design wins in the autonomous space.Gross margins are expected to be better than the prior 25nm cycle, as yields/density changes contribute cost leverage. Furthermore, recent data on pricing trends, paired with a CEO change from Mark Durcan to Sanjay Mehrotra, help elevate sentiment as it signals a shift in strategic decision making.Source: Barclays America ResearchNAND/DRAM pricing has continued to trend higher with demand healthy, as smartphones move to higher memory/storage configurations in the current channel.

The CFO commentary highlighted heightened software/service revenue taking a bigger component of the mix, which was representative of 43% of the total revenue mix. The management team expects the software/service component to become 50% of the total business by FY’20.The CFO guided $48 billion revenue and $2.39 non-GAAP EPS for FY’17. Non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be flat at 31% for FY’17.

While we don’t offer equity coverage on IT providers, it’s worth noting that Cisco remains a viable defensive play when compared to other names in the space, as its revenue mix is less dependent on network switches, and has transitioned to be less hardware dependent over the years. This transition has been more successful when compared to the sluggish performance of legacy IT models from Oracle (ORCL) and International Business Machines (IBM).Western Digital litigated by Toshiba to the tune of $1.1 billion in damagesSome negative news hit Western Digital (WDC) shareholders in the past couple days. Toshiba filed suit against Western Digital in Tokyo court this past week. The premise of the legal argument hinged on Western Digital’s involvement in the proposed sale of Toshiba’s efforts to spin off its memory subsidiary, which is expected to have broad industry implications assuming memory capacity additions can be made following the sale of Toshiba Memory.Hence, the lawsuit stirs up lots of bad blood between the two companies. In the statement issued, according to EETimes:The proposed sale of the business unit has wide industry implications. At the NASDAQ 36th Investor Program Conference, Ernie Maddock, CFO of Micron, helps summarize the potential implications of Toshiba’s NAND business following a sale:Keep in mind, the memory business is extremely sensitive to supply, so if Toshiba is unable to spin off the business unit in a timely manner, it would be additive to industry pricing.Online travel agency data inflects positivelyAccording to Piper Jaffray research, the US Hotel RevPAR (revenue per average room) grew by 3% y/y in Q2, Europe grew 4% y/y and APAC grew 8% y/y.Source: Piper JaffrayOccupancy trends remained stable in the United States, whereas Europe/APAC showed modest patterns of growth.

4081206,102819,2017-06-13T16:01:22-04:00,"Western Digital is a major manufacturer of hard disk drives and flash storage.The acquisition of SanDisk in 2016 placed a substantial amount of debt on the company's balance sheet.WDC is currently embroiled in difficult bidding war for Toshiba's flash business and it could significantly affect its near-term future.Given the uncertainty over this chip sale, it's hard to see a dividend increase in the near future.","Credit: Quintin LinWestern Digital (NYSE:WDC) is approaching 50 years in operation and is now a major player in the data storage industry. In recent times, it has also become a solid dividend payer in the technology space.Before the stock's run up over the last 12 months, WDC boasted a yield of 4% and continuous payments dating back to 2012. Today, the yield is around 2.2% and the dividend has stalled at $0.50 for eight consecutive quarters.This article will take a look at Western Digital's dividend history, cash flow situation, debt pile and the convoluted saga with Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY).AboutWestern Digital was founded in 1970 in Irvine, California, as General Digital Corporation before its rename. It was first known for producing calculator chips and then moved into hard disk drive controllers and data storage in the 1980s.Today, WDC is a major manufacturer of both hard disk drives and flash memory, the latter thanks to the $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk in 2016. It has a market cap of $26 billion and has been led by CEO Stephen Milligan since January 2013.Dividend HistoryWDC paid its first quarterly dividend of $0.25 in October 2012. In the time since, the payout to shareholders has doubled to $2 per annum.Credit: High Plains InvestorAs you can see from the chart above, management first declared a $2 dividend for 2015 and has not increased it in the interim.Bear in mind that WDC completed the SanDisk deal in May 2016, so it's no surprise that cash flow has been cautiously managed during this period.Free Cash FlowCredit: High Plains InvestorFree cash flow declined over the past five years as the company transitioned from a noted hard disk drive manufacturer to one that also produces a substantial amount of flash memory. Despite the slump, WDC had a healthy FCF payout ratio of 36% in 2016.Thankfully for management, the added revenues from SanDisk have rejuvenated earnings. With three quarters of the 2017 fiscal year reported, $1.8 billion of free cash flow has already been generated.Solely looking from a cash flow point of view, WDC is currently in a strong position to maintain and increase its dividend.Debt SituationCredit: High Plains InvestorThe undoubted benefits of the SanDisk acquisition are somewhat balanced by a significant negative - increased debt.WDC's long-term debt jumped from $2.2 billion at the end of 2015 to $13.7 billion the following year. As of June 2017, the company has a current ratio of 2.4, quick ratio of 1.9 and debt-to-free cash flow of 5.8.While the leverage ratios have weakened, they are still manageable. The chief issue that will affect WDC's balance sheet, and the company's near-term future, is the much reported Toshiba chip sale.The Saga With ToshibaIt's hard to know where to start with the Toshiba flash fracas since the situation changes daily, but here are the main details.Credit: ToshibaToshiba is trying to sell its flash business which is centered in a manufacturing plant in Yokkaichi, Japan (above). WDC has a stake in this plant which it inherited through the SanDisk acquisition.The Japanese company needs to sell its semiconductor segment to offset massive losses incurred by nuclear subsidiary Westinghouse. The situation is so serious that Toshiba could be delisted from the Tokyo Stock Exchange.Western Digital believes that it should have approval rights on the winning bidder. Toshiba disputes this reading of the contract and wants WDC to butt out of the sale process.There is rumored to be a number of suitors for the flash business including US firm Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), a group led by private equity firm KKR & Co., Hon Hai Precision Industry Co. of Taiwan, and SK Hynix of South Korea. WDC has made what's believed to be a last ditch $18 billion offer for the operation.ConclusionAt this point, it is not clear what will come of Western Digital's efforts in the Toshiba bidding process, or how much it might be obliged to pay. However, as a dividend-minded investor, I think it's logical to draw two possibilities from the affair.If WDC successfully wins the auction for Toshiba's chip business, thus requiring a significant cash outlay, then a dividend raise is unlikely in the near future. With a substantial amount of debt on the books already, it's hard to imagine management actively decreasing the cash pile.The alternative is that WDC fails in the bidding process. In that case, there is the possibility of an increased payment given the low payout ratio and earnings on the rebound.While the company could of course cut or reduce its dividend, that would no doubt result in a negative reaction from some shareholders.Given the uncertainty over the Toshiba sale, and enormous run up WDC has made in the past 12 months, I won't be adding to my position in the near future but retain faith in its future prospects.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4084452,102890,2017-06-28T07:03:46-04:00,"The NAND chip is a flash memory device that is in increasingly high demand due to its vital usage in the newest Apple products and also the fast-selling Nintendo Switch.Toshiba co-owns the largest chip supplier, however, due to financial troubles with their US nuclear plant they are being forced to sell the unit.Potential suitors include Foxconn, a cohort of US, South Korean and Japanese investors, and Western Digital, who currently own a 49% stake in the business.The successor to the NAND chip unit will likely see huge revenues drawn from the in-demand device, and Toshiba will lose their greatest asset.","In March of this year, Nintendo (OTCPK:NTDOY) released their hybrid console, the Switch, which immediately flew off of the shelves and left the company doubling production figures to restock shops. The demand for the new console has been sustained and the only thing holding back production is the lack of availability of the all-important NAND chip, which is also in excess demand from Apple (AAPL) as they ramp up production towards the upcoming release of the iPhone 8. The NAND chip is a flash memory device which is essential to the construction and sale of both devices, and the crux of both companies’ demand is falling on the shoulders of the decaying Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) brand.Source: BBCToshiba has been in a lot of financial trouble and are consistently hemorrhaging money YoY with their most recent troubles coming from a nuclear plant in the US – this disaster has led to such an extraordinary need to gain cash in hand, that they are now being forced to sell potentially their greatest asset, their NAND chip division. Whilst this spells disaster for Toshiba, it will create a large opportunity for revenue growth for whomever can complete the acquisition.There are a few suitors to the unit, and the driver’s seat is potentially underneath the US firm Western Digital (WDC). The company already has employees working within the division, which it has a 49% stake in, and would be able to most seamlessly take over the operations of the business and ramp up production to meet the huge demand that the unit is receiving. I believe that due to the familiarity that WD have with the facilities, they are the leading contender to make instant profitability growth from the unit and make the necessary investments into the division to further its revenue potential. Also, due to their stake in the firm it is likely that they will be able to veto the selling of the unit to other candidates, frustrating the process and delaying the cash transaction that Toshiba require.Other suitors include the cohort of US, South Korean and Japanese investors who may currently be Toshiba’s favoured acquirers but that are having troubled patching together an agreement, especially amidst the interference of WD. Toshiba have today announced their plans to ignite a law suit against the behaviour of Western Digital, however it may come to fruition that this is just an attempt to speed up the deal-making process. Foxconn (OTC:FXCOF) are another serious candidate for acquisition as they announced earlier that they were “very confident” of securing the deal, however, since this statement their confidence may have waned slightly as WDC ramp up their efforts to win the race.To conclude, I believe that the eventual hand-over of the NAND chip making unit will provide a large catalyst for the firms involved in the transaction. My belief is that the Toshiba stock will take a large hit if the whole division is sold as investors will see the company lose one of its core assets and revenue drivers and due to the fact that the cash received from the transaction will be sent straight to cover the damages of their nuclear factory in the US, I recommend the shorting of the TOSBF stock.On the upside, however, there is more uncertainty. Due to their current part-ownership in the unit I believe that Western Digital have a good chance of securing, or at least frustrating, the deal which would see huge upside potential to the WDC stock as they could acquire a potentially huge revenue source with the expectation of ongoing excess demand from Apple and Nintendo, amongst others, which will drive the price and profitability of the chip upwards for the foreseeable future. However, there is caution to be taken amidst the uncertainty of the lawsuit imposed by Toshiba against Western Digital and the preference towards other bidders if Toshiba are allowed a direct choice.Toshiba hosts its AGM later today (Wednesday 28th June) and this will likely reveal the company’s current financial situation as well as the progression of plans regarding this unit; with the lawsuit in focus, they are likely to offer a pessimistic view on WDC’s chances of securing the unit, however, their need for cash may nullify this statement and over the following weeks it will become clear how strong WDC’s bargaining power is.Western Digital will announce their Q4 results next month (27th July) and have recently increased their eps guidelines as they expect to provide positive figures for FY17.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4087717,101850,2017-07-14T09:20:16-04:00,WDC's legal case is watertight.Harold Kahn will be ruling again - and he already ruled for WDC a few days ago.The other strategic bidders have strings attached.WDC will soon be exclusively negotiating for Toshiba's JV share.WDC will close this eventually.,"If you thought things have gone badly for Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) so far, it’s about to get worse.As this recent article here notes, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) was granted a court order ""requiring Toshiba to give Western Digital employees access to chip samples and related shared databases"" after Toshiba had moved to block Western Digital’s access to certain databases starting 28 June. This decision is significant for a number of key reasons - 1) It prevents Toshiba from impeding the shipment of engineering wafers and samples to WD, 2) it allows WDC employees to access shared databases (Toshiba had previously attempted to block “certain” employees) and 3) the restraining order was ruled upon by the same judge who is about to rule on the 14th July injunction hearing - Harold Kahn.(Source: San Francisco Superior Court)With the 14th July hearing already upon us, the Harold Kahn factor is a big swing factor here. Here’s a recap of Toshiba’s key arguments per legal filings in early July:#1 - The California court has no jurisdictionThis seems flimsy at best. For one, Toshiba’s breach goes back to the Master Agreements, which explicitly state that they “shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California”.Here’s an excerpt of key points from the Master Agreement’s anti transfer provision:There are no exceptions in the anti-transfer provision in the Master Agreements, which are governed by California law.Meanwhile, Toshiba’s case is built on a line from the Operating Agreements, which state that “they shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Japan”. But this would contradict the specific details in the overall Flash Ventures’ Operating and Master Agreements with regard to disputes handled under arbitration in San Francisco, CA.#2 – TMC’s JV OwnershipToshiba’s other key argument is that the “interests” at dispute are not held by Toshiba Memory Corp. (TMC), thus TMC should not be considered party to this litigation. Toshiba claims that FV is merely a financing vehicle and has no claim over the land, facilities, IP, R&D, etc.I wrote about this issue here and here. Here’s a brief recap:Followed by:Here’s the fact - the premise on which this argument is built is a violation of the agreements in the first place. By transferring the key assets into a separate affiliate entity without WDC’s consent, Toshiba has already breached the agreements.Here’s an excerpt:Besides, Toshiba has already shot itself in the foot with this argument. To understand why, here’s an excerpt from Toshiba’s legal filings:(Source: San Francisco Superior Court)By arguing that FV generates only $13m and carries a book value <$1b, WDC could thus be obligated to buy out Toshiba’s share of the JV at precisely that (vs. the ~$18b INCJ bid) in an “event of default” (which Toshiba has already triggered by failing to ""uncure"" transferring JV assets to Toshiba Memory without WDC’s consent).Now, ignoring Toshiba’s move to revert the JV assets back to its parentco (an implied validation of WDC’s consent rights) and the absurd notion that SanDisk has pumped in billions in capex for share in a mere financing vehicle, this claim should not even exist as it was built on a blatant violation of the agreements in the first place.#3 - WDC has already waived its consent rightsThis claim goes back to a December 4 Undertaking argument in which WDC proposed that Toshiba relinquishes its consent right over SanDisk’s transfer of its Flash Ventures Interests to wholly-owned subsidiaries of Western Digital. Here’s an excerpt of the draft Undertaking:This would be a convincing argument - if it was true.Here's what really happened - WDC and Toshiba had an “Undertaking” in place where both parties would waive their consent rights. But, when WDC learned of Toshiba’s intention to sell off its share of FV, and before any agreement was signed, WDC had objected to the draft. Per WDC:This is important for two reasons - 1) WDC had already intentionally preserved its consent rights a few months ago for this very reason - to corner Toshiba and get FV on the cheap, and 2) Toshiba has been aware of WDC’s playbook for a while now but has not been able to effectively counter WDC’s consent rights in any way.Just how weak is Toshiba’s argument here? The overwhelming evidence lies at the top of the pages of Toshiba’s provided “Undertaking” exhibits:(Source: San Francisco Superior Court)The Hynix factorMake no mistake about this - Hynix’s (OTC:HXSCF) participation is a major problem for Toshiba. How big? Toshiba has left Hynix out of not just one, but two press releases referencing the INCJ bidding consortium.Toshiba’s rationale is that Hynix is simply a loan provider and will not be receiving voting rights. How absurd is that? The open secret is that, while Hynix seems to be currently hiding behind Bain Capital in the consortium, the company is pushing for a bigger role in the future.Here's a great illustration of the “real” structure as it stands:(Source: Macquarie)INCJ is currently assumed to be the majority contributor of capital with Hynix set to contribute through convertible bonds. Now, with the exception of Hynix, every other player in the consortium is a financial buyer with zero strategic interest in the asset. That’s a problem for Toshiba, WDC and Japan, Inc. not just near term but especially once the PE guys exit in a few years.For one, Hynix has a history of IP theft with the very same party it is buying from - Toshiba. Here’s an excerpt from my previous article:Second, Toshiba’s claim that SK Hynix is being altruistic enough to provide debt assistance in exchange for zero interest in the asset is rubbish. According to the Hynix CEO himself, Hynix has no plans to relinquish its aim of obtaining an equity stake in the business. In fact, his insistence that its investment in the flash memory unit be via convertible bonds, which could lead to an equity stake, is threatening to sink the deal.Thirdly, there is a huge conflict of interest at play here. Hynix is not committed to obtaining its flash wafers from Yokkaichi, having a competing NAND flash memory business in place already. In fact, Hynix would have to choose between investing in its own facilities or Fab 6 and other JV facilities where Hynix would have only a partial interest. No prizes for guessing the outcome there. Hynix’s most likely motive behind the transaction is IP. As things stand, Hynix’s technology is one or two years behind Toshiba-SanDisk’s (and has been for a while). Participation in this transaction would give Hynix access to FV’s more advanced IP, which would benefit Hynix at the expense of the remaining JV partner, WDC.The question remains - why did Toshiba select Hynix in the first place? If the court filings are to be believed, it’s not good. What Hynix is doing behind the scenes is as follows - 1) Promise existing Toshiba management new jobs, 2) grant assurances of employment to key Toshiba personnel post transaction and 3) promise to grant equity interests to key Toshiba personnel if the transaction goes through. Meanwhile, WDC seems to have focused on the rank and file employees, which while noble hasn’t quite appealed to key Toshiba decision makers as much.The Tiff With BroadcomAnother interesting tidbit from recent filings is WDC’s revelation regarding its opposition to Broadcom’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) participation in the bidding process (recall that Broadcom was one of the highest bidders in the initial round). As it turns out, the problems began after LSI was acquired by Broadcom (Avago). WDC claims that Broadcom cut off its supply of HDD preamplifiers (preamps) when it learned that WDC had been qualifying a new preamp supplier, demanding that WDC agree to a glide path to acquire 100% of preamps from it. Broadcom later backtracked, but the experience has left WDC in vehement opposition to any Broadcom participation in the NAND JV.WDC To Win - EventuallyThe overhang over WDC is unwarranted. If WDC’s watertight case doesn’t convince you of a very high probability win at the injunction, bear in mind that the injunction will be presided by the same judge who ruled for the American company earlier for the restraining order. So, the base case in my view is that WDC wins the ruling.The key question though will be whether Toshiba will be ordered to suspend the sale of the joint venture interests only or the entire JV. And if it is ordered to suspend the sale process, whether Toshiba will actually abide by the court ruling considering the extremely tight March 2018 deadline for Toshiba to remain a viable public company.Thinking big picture, if Hynix (IP theft), Broadcom (poor WDC relationship) and Hon Hai (regulator disapproval) can’t participate, that leaves WDC in the clear driving seat without even considering the legal implications here. The outcome of today’s ruling, which I believe will be in WDC’s favor, should scare off potential bidders anyway, which would give WDC exclusive negotiating rights over Toshiba’s share of FV. It should then come down to what terms WDC will be able to squeeze out of an increasingly desperate Toshiba.In any case, it’s a great time to be invested in WDC.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4084243,101850,2017-06-27T12:31:36-04:00,"Toshiba's favored bidding consortium is a problem - Hynix.An ""event of default"" is Western Digital's ace in the hole, and it's worth trillions.But negotiations on the new fabs have halted, risking disruption to FY2018 plans.A ¥2tn deal is worth ~11-12% accretion to FY2018 EPS.Base case remains a sale to Western Digital.","Key DevelopmentsAs things stand, Toshiba’s (OTCPK:TOSBF) preferred bidder group for its memory subsidiary is now a bidder consortium that includes the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan (INCJ), Development Bank of Japan (DBJ), Bain Capital and SK Hynix. The consortium’s offer is reported to be around the ¥2tn mark i.e. the lower limit set by Toshiba. All this while the NAND JV remains shrouded under controversy as Western Digital (WDC) pushes forward with their legal contention. The final conclusion of the contract with the consortium may be pushed back to 28th June, on the same date as Toshiba’s AGM, but the real deadline will probably be on the 14th of July, when a court hearing regarding WDC’s lawsuit comes to pass.WDC’s lawsuit has thus far, affected more than just Toshiba’s bidding process. Credit extensions to the tune of ¥280bn have ground to a halt as Toshiba has been unable to use Toshiba Memory shares as collateral due to Western Digital’s lawsuit. In fact, Toshiba was unable to withdraw funds from the existing credit facility, but Japanese banks will reportedly take measures that will allow the Toshiba Memory shares to still be considered as collateral.Meanwhile, WDC is reportedly aiming to acquire the chip unit through a partnership with KKR, the INCJ and the DBJ. WDC is currently opposing the inclusion of SK Hynix despite their stance as mere provider of funds (likely a front to push through antitrust hurdles). Which makes sense, considering the other members are PE funds and the aim is to float the flash memory unit after a period of two or three years (leaving Hynix in control). Toshiba seems to have softened its stance toward WDC, publicly announcing their willingness to hold talks with WDC, paving the way for “changes to the composition of the consortium.” The existing bidder consortium has formally requested that WDC participate in the group, but WDC hasn’t heeded the call, continuing to both emphasize its consent rights and its disagreement with Hynix’s participation.Hynix – IP thief?Hynix’s participation in the bidder consortium seems strange. According to the Nikkei, Bain Capital and SK Hynix will together acquire a stake of 33.4%, giving them voting rights to veto major decisions, while the DBJ would hold the remaining 16.5%. The investment breakdown would be as follows – INCJ at JPY 300bn, DBJ at JPY 100bn, and Bain Capital/SK Hynix at and aggregate JPY 200bn.After all, it was only 3 years ago on July 21 2014 when SK Hynix publicly disclosed in a regulatory filing that the company had received official notice of a lawsuit from Toshiba (filed earlier in March), seeking W1.1tn in damages over the alleged leak of NAND flash technology. The lawsuit also requested that Hynix destroy all information about the stolen NAND flash technology, and asked that Hynix stop producing and selling NAND flash products that use the allegedly stolen technology.The 2014 lawsuit wasn’t even Toshiba’s first legal scuffle with SK Hynix; it was the second such incident. In 2004, Toshiba sued SK Hynix for violations of its memory chip patents, but eventually resolved the litigation through a licensing deal in 2007.WDC/ SanDisk also filed a separate civil lawsuit against Hynix that March, seeking damages over the alleged theft of data related to SanDisk and Toshiba’s NAND flash technology.The fact that Hynix will now seemingly get a stake and obtain access to the NAND technology - three years after being sued for attempting to steal it - seems strange considering its history with Toshiba and Sandisk, but probably reflects Toshiba’s lack of options - no other party besides Hynix and WDC has the expertise required to operate the NAND JV.Toshiba’s (Weird) Press StatementIf the Toshiba-WDC deal watching has taught you anything, it’s probably this – don’t trust the news, especially if it comes out of Japan. For all the press noise about Hynix and their participation, Toshiba has conveniently enough, excluded them from the official announcement.Although we do know for sure is that SK Hynix is not mentioned as part of the consortium in Toshiba’s statement, Western Digital’s response in the preliminary injunction documents did note Hynix’s participation. In fact, WDC’s claim is that the consortium is being led by SK Hynix and Bain Capital Japan – which makes me question if Hynix’s inclusion was a deliberate move to push WDC into a deal.About two weeks ago, court documents to the tune of 15 documents filed and 591 pages were released by the Superior Court of California (Link here). Digging through this trove has been fascinating to say the least. The degree of hostility with which WDC has dealt with throughout the deal process is telling of Toshiba’s desperation – they really need to close this deal quickly and at the highest price possible.Western Digital’s Ace in The HoleBrowsing through the court documents reinforce my long held view that Toshiba has been backed into a corner here but new information suggest that WDC’s legal recourse is much, much stronger than I initially expected.According to the court documents, WDC’s official offer was to ¥1.6T ($14.3B) for Toshiba’s memory assets – 20% lower than Toshiba’s lower limit of ¥2tn. Naturally, Toshiba rejected the bid in favour of a reported ¥2tn bid from the Bain/ Hynix consortium.Toshiba’s main argument against WDC's consent rights hinges on a draft agreement (""undertaking"") when WDC acquired Sandisk. Of course, Toshiba missed the part where “FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY” disclaimer. In other words, Toshiba's argument rests on an agreement that was never effective or executed by each party and delivered - very flimsy.WDC subsequently claimed that Toshiba triggered an “Event of Default” by failing to “uncure” transferring JV assets to Toshiba Memory w/o WDC’s consent, which entitles WDC to buy-out rights of Toshiba’s JV interest at an amount equal to the net book value of Toshiba’s share of the business.If this rings true, Toshiba's attempts to circumvent WDC's consent rights could backfire spectacularly and WDC could pick this up at pennies on the dollar.What is Toshiba Memory Worth?If the transaction goes through at Toshiba’s asking price of ¥2tn (base case), this would yield ~11-12% accretion to FY2018 EPS – at least. Conditional of course on 1) ~47% top line growth into FY 2017 moderating to mid-single digits in FY2018 yields, 2) WDC funding ~33% akin to current INCJ consortium structure, 3) 67% debt funded at ~3% interest, and 4) ~50% integration into FY2018.But what if WDC triggers an “Event of Default” and only pays book value? According to analyst estimates, book value could be as low as <$1bn– 20x lower than current bidding prices. Accretion into FY2018 would increase significantly but the return on an investment like that would be enormous (Toshiba NAND sales are already ~$7-8bn).Risk of Disruption to JV OperationsThe court documents also specify that as of May 15, 2017 Toshiba unilaterally halted negotiations with WDC for future capex plans on Fab 6. According to court documents, Fab 6 began construction in Feb 2017 and still has hefty investments ahead. Any delays/ disruptions to Fab 6 or Fab 7 are a serious threat to WDC as it risks falling behind competitors that continue to push forward with capacity. Fab 6 is a key focus as this is an important variable in WDC / Toshiba’s 3D NAND ramp looking into 2018.The Injunctive Relief request pertains to W. Digital’s efforts to maintain the status quo (i.e., no movement of JV interests) until an arbitration decision is rendered – a process that can take 16-24 months. But Toshiba could in turn, entirely halt negotiations on Fab 6 and 7, disrupting future capacity.All things considered, with both delisting and the potential loss of ¥1tn on the horizon, Toshiba has their backs firmly to the wall here. Their listing fate rests on the Memory sale - a sale at book value would effectively condemn Toshiba to a delisting next year (note that they've already been demoted from the TSE First Section to the TSE Second Section effective August).Chase the Trillions or Chase Capacity?WDC is in a great position here – even better than I anticipated before. Toshiba is now caught between a rock (antitrust + money) and a very,very hard place (legal recourse + even more money). The path of least resistance is clear here – go with WDC. Hence, the base case remains the same - WDC will be involved in the final bid. If Hynix is selected, WDC will likely see the deal as less favorable and less complementary than an otherwise healthy Toshiba and we could see WDC push forward with its legal case. WDC’s filing for injunctive relief is valid and will stretch the deal proceedings into July – unless they cave to WDC’s demands.In the event that Toshiba chooses to not respond to the court and instead attempts to sell its JV interest to this third party, we could see WDC request expedited relief, and the court could rule in favor of WDC’s assertion and trigger an “Event of Default” which, if upheld, would allow WDC to pick up Toshiba Memory at pennies on the dollar. This alone should prevent Toshiba from further escalating tensions between itself and WDC.Clearing the Toshiba Memory overhang should also drive a much better multiple on WDC’s stock as it would remove the incessant focus on risks surrounding the JV. This, plus the clear accretion potential (11-12%) should drive WDC higher. Long WDC.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Collectively termed Flash Ventures, the term appears 112 times in their 150 page 2016 Annual Report. WDC currently owns 49.9% of the entity formed in 2006, and Toshiba Corporation (OTCPK:TOSBF) owns the remaining 50.1%In the ‘Risk Factors’ section, WDC states:There is simply no alternative for WDC to remain a key player in the evolution of the Memory Storage Roadmap other than to secure the supply and retain the Intellectual Property embedded in FV. In fact, this FV was pivotal in WDC’s acquisition of SanDisk, allowing WDC’s evolution from HDD’s to SSD’s as memory intensive applications are increasingly required at the coalface. For more detail on why the advent of Artificial Intelligence (think Autopilot software in cars that require massive processing of data instantaneously as opposed to being retrieved from a cloud), please read this excellent article by SA Contributor William Tidwell, The Internet Of Things = The Internet Of NAND - Good News For MicronThere’s a catch to the large-scale introduction of NAND memory: A monumental investment as manufacturing migrates from 2D to 3D NAND. From WDC’s most recent financial disclosure (3Q F2017 10Q), the investment projection in the 5 year future was $6.3 Bn in Flash Ventures, and this was only for their 49.9% stake.This provides a perfect explanation for two things:-Toshiba’s beleaguered financial condition obliges them to relinquish FV despite its enormous potential; mired by accounting scandals and deep losses in the company’s nuclear business, Toshiba has no option but sell.-There are very few players with the financial pockets and operational expertise to contemplate FV’s purchase. As posited in this prescient article, The Toshiba NAND Business - A Forensic Analysis (written in March ’17) the only likely bidders would be core NAND players coupled with private equity partners; despite NAND memory being the bedrock of the information highway, the likes of Alphabet or Apple or unlikely to taint their pristine balance sheets and juicy margins with a cyclical, complex and highly capital-intensive industry.Toshiba’s preferred bidder is a consortium led by Bain Capital, a Japanese government-backed fund, a state bank and financing from rival Korean chipmaker SK Hynix. As outlined in this SA article, WDC has grave misgivings about the involvement of Hynik, whose respect for IP is somewhat negated by its chequered history, including two allegations of IP theft.The legal machinations of WDC and Toshiba are well summarised in the above article, but in summary, SA Contributor JP Research states:The watertight legal conviction WDC holds is evidenced by its recent actions: It has refused to participate in the existing bid, insisting it has right of first refusal; it has served Toshiba and the consortium an injunction if the bid proceedings continue. On 27 June, WDC has also presented a new bid, coupled with Private Equity firm KKR, giving Toshiba the opportunity of debt financing. This statement from the above press release is key:Although details are not firm on the above announcement, my interpretation is that WDC is willing to take on a debt facility from KKR to facilitate an expeditious sale of FV. This debt will fund the purchase of FV, and WDC will later pursue an equity raising to optimise the financial structure. This would circumvent the SEC hurdles on issuing new equity currently. Problem solved: Toshiba gets much needed cash immediately, WDC issues new debt provided by KKR and commits to a secondary equity issue in the near future.In my deep dive into WDC disclosures, I discovered a very salient point. The stricken state of Toshiba has led to a dramatic deferral of investment in the FV. Compare the following:This is from the 2016 Annual Report, ending June 2016: Nine months later from the 2Q ’17 10Q,The following is a summary of our known contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as of December 30, 2016In the fiscal year 2017, WDC spent a mere $20m on the FV. So the capital injected for 2017 has fallen by $1.5 bn, and this has been deferred to the 2018-2019 time frame. One could not hope for more positive news on the outlook of NAND pricing – investment and capacity has been severely deferred, despite annual growth rates of 45% in NAND demand. There can be no more solid proof to the outlook of NAND players than the meteoric trajectory of Micron’s (MU) share price, the purest NAND play, which has trebled in the space of a year.It has been surprisingly difficult to piece together the valuation of FV, as both holding entities (Toshiba and WDC) have kept the financial details well shrouded, probably due IP theft reasons as well as the lucrativeness of the business.However here is my attempt at valuing it, using the following assumptions, garnered from WDC financial disclosures:Assuming a $20 Bn purchase price (Note WDC could purchase it for $18bn, we don’t know yet), the Trailing PE that WDC will pay is 21.3X. This compares extremely favourably to Micron’s trailing PE of 49X. Note Micron's forward earnings are predicted to rise dramatically, but so will FV's in sync.ConclusionAs per the recent earnings guidance for WDC, the company will earn $12 for Calendar 2017. A PE of 7.6X!! This places it on less than half the Market PE, with an enviable outlook aligned with the information highway and its insatiable memory needs.Recent events convince me WDC will not rest until FV is wholly owned; the company has supreme conviction on its legal grounding and Toshiba’s desperate status will oblige a swift transaction, initially funded by KKR debt, and subsequently followed by a WDC equity raise.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4081414,101850,2017-06-14T11:39:13-04:00,The Toshiba acquisition remains WDC's to lose.INCJ (Japanese government) is the key partner.Toshiba can afford the lower ¥2tn valuation.The antitrust argument for AVGO is valid - but a legal battle would render it invalid.Toshiba is a compelling short if a messy legal battle ensues.,"In my last article, I commented that the Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) clouds were set to clear soon with a clear timeline being drawn out for the asset sale. My base case remains the same and I do believe this issue will ultimately get resolved, with slight delays - long Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). If not, Toshiba runs serious risk of getting delisted, as a messy legal battle is set to ensue - short Toshiba.What's changed?For one, Toshiba is now caught between a rock (antitrust + money) and a very hard place (legal recourse). Recall that Toshiba has a very tight timeline to fight off delisting (due to two consecutive years of negative equity). The Sandisk deal took about seven months to complete, which implies a potential WD/Toshiba deal would take at least as long if not longer for a strategic buyer. At this stage, getting through approvals in 9 months would be impressive on its own, but taking the degree of cross-border regulatory complexity into account means even that timeline is stretched. For some context, here's a brief near term timeline for Toshiba:Note that this doesn't even touch on the mess Toshiba currently finds itself in with regard to its nuclear business.INCJ is Key(NYSE:FT)Business in Japan works differently from the capitalist system of the States. Japanese firms in distress have historically benefited from the support network offered by the government. 2012 for instance, saw the state-backed INCJ fund assemble an all-Japan consortium backed by Toyota and Panasonic to prevent Renesas from being taken over by KKR. In late 2016, INCJ then bailed out Japan Display, a company that holds far less relevance to corporate Japan than Toshiba.Don't be fooled by the public stance, the INCJ is there for Toshiba just in case and so the Japanese government is very much in play here. The purpose for INCJ will most likely be to provide some temporary relief (vs. a full bailout) in the form of financing/government and to ensure the jewel of Toshiba's crown doesn't fall into the wrong hands.But then again, logic doesn't always prevail when it comes to Japanese bailouts - the government's history of bailing out companies has been somewhat unpredictable. But in this case, the Development Bank of Japan's (DBJ) additional involvement in the consortium points to potential intervention by the Japanese government.This has two key implications - 1) it shields WDC from having to take immediate action regarding Flash Ventures should Toshiba fall into financial trouble and more importantly, 2) joining INCJ and DBJ is key to winning this deal.The Bids So FarBidders reported to be involved by Reuters and the Nikkei are:Toshiba-spun headlines aside, the two leading bidders at this time are - the WDC-INCJ consortium and Silverlake-AVGO. Rumors of an SK Hynix participation just don't seem to add up due to political reasons. For one, Hynix is already an active player in NAND and might raise antitrust hurdles. More importantly though, cross-border politics are not favorable - all major Japanese IT companies have restructured or exited core businesses (DRAM, display, Rechargeable battery, TV) due to the threat from Korean companies. The potential negative publicity in Japan from a Hynix deal would prevent a Korean memory company-Japanese state fund link up from buying Toshiba. Same issue applies to Hon Hai whose deep ties with China, will be a key stumbling block as the Japanese government will not want Toshiba's chip technology taken out of Japan.WDC is the clear frontrunner here. By 1) linking up with PE funding and 2) opting for a minority interest, WDC's balance sheet should not be stretched and it remains well positioned to win the bidding war.AVGO may have the higher bid, but as I outlined here, a Toshiba acquisition would not fit within their overall strategy. Quoting Hock Tan, ""Don't believe everything you read out there, please."" The real driver behind the deal is likely Silver Lake. But it's hard to believe AVGO would dip so readily into an asset riddled in as much legal risk as Toshiba Memory. Besides, without the participation of a Japanese partner, the bid holds much less weight than a WDC consortium.Toshiba Can Afford a Little LessThere's been a lot of speculation on the value of Toshiba Memory and how much upside a sale would bring to Toshiba's equity position. What we do know for sure, is that Toshiba has to sell off a significant portion to fund its equity position.According to the scenario analysis below (courtesy of GS), a minority stake sale (20%), even at a stretched 22x PE would do little to help Toshiba avoid delisting.The second scenario - Toshiba sells 51% and gives up control implies Toshiba needs a 20-22x valuation (far higher than Sandisk) to turn around its equity position with minimal buffer. If - and this is a very big if - Toshiba did achieve such lofty valuations, they would still run the risk of the transaction falling through before the two term deadline.Which has led Toshiba to the ""sell 100% scenario."" Across a range of valuations, we see that Toshiba needs a minimum ¥1.6tn bid to just about stay listed. Note that ¥1.6tn was WDC's initial offer before reportedly raising to ¥2tn. While Toshiba is pushing for the ¥2.2tn range where AVGO currently stands, WDC seems to be holding firm on ¥2tn which would still give Toshiba ample room to turn positive equity.The implication for Toshiba is this - 1) get the ¥2tn in 1 year and stay listed or 2) chase ¥2.2tn in > 1 year and delist. In other words, Toshiba is currently stuck between a rock (antitrust + money) and a very hard place (legal recourse). The rational choice in this game of chicken would be WDC + INCJ (provided the consortium stays intact) but if Toshiba opts otherwise, we would then enter a legal battleground which could see Toshiba lose out completely.Antitrust vs. Consent RightsOne important point to keep in mind when sifting through the news flow around this deal is the ""invisible hand"" of Toshiba. While WDC has its legal hold as a bargaining chip, Toshiba is working hard behind the scenes to push back.Take for instance, this recent piece by the Shimbun (translated from print):""Broadcom [NASDAQ:AVGO] is seen as having become the superior bidder for Toshiba's (TYO:6502] flash memory unit, the Yomiuri Shimbun reported.The Japanese-language report cited several persons related to the matter, who said that the US-based chip maker and Toshiba are proceeding with talks based on Broadcom's bid of JPY 2.2tn (USD 20bn), which exceeds Toshiba's call for bids of at least JPY 2tn. Since Broadcom's main business involves making communications-related semiconductors, it is expected that there would not be any problems gaining approval from antitrust regulators, the report said.Additionally, Toshiba's main lending banks are positively evaluating the stability of Broadcom's offer, which will fund the deal on its own, the report said.Toshiba is also conducting talks with three other groups, namely, a US-Japan consortium that includes the Innovation Network Corp of Japan (INCJ), the consortium of Bain Capital and South Korea-based SK Hynix, and a group that includes Taiwan-based Hon Hai Precision Industry and Sharp Corp., the report said.Meanwhile, there is a possibility that the situation could change depending on a revised offer that Western Digital is expected to submit to Toshiba by as early as 14 June, the report said."" (Source: Shimbun Print)If WDC rises to ¥2tn, the deal dynamics come down to antitrust vs. consent rights.On antitrust, the AVGO-Silverlake bid is the winner as the transaction would have an easier time getting approvals. A merger of WDC and Toshiba could trigger antitrust hurdles with a combined market share ~29% of the NAND market. Toshiba might also be counting on the fact that an AVGO acquisition wouldn't affect the NAND market the way Hynix or the Chinese would and so, WDC might be less incentivized to pursue legal recourse.On the other hand, WDC management clearly believes their consent rights hold merit, which could be a material bargaining chip if WDC holds firm. The crux of WDC's argument is that the Flash Ventures JV agreements with Toshiba obligates that neither of the parties can transfer an interest in the JV without the other's consent. As I outlined previously, Toshiba has backed down on numerous attempts to circumvent the agreement. With all the legal mess that's been going on, it's hard to believe that a buyer would bid on a contested asset without the necessary assurance that a court battle would not ensue and hold up the bid. Note that WDC had filed an arbitration claim in mid-May to block the sale and push for a lower valuation.Now, considering the proximity of the June 13 arbitration deadline with the planned June 15th decision, WDC likely plans to file injunctions in the US (if it has not already done so). This would 1) delay the sale even further, 2) render Toshiba's argument in favor of a faster timeline due to antitrust hurdles moot, 3) discourage potential buyers, 4) depress valuations and 5) result in inevitable delisting for Toshiba.In any case, if WDC can keep INCJ and DBJ in its consortium, they should win this game of chicken (long WDC). If not, get set for some legal turbulence ahead as the clock is already ticking (short Toshiba).Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4062567,101850,2017-04-15T17:27:51-04:00,Valuations for Toshiba memory have been lofty.But there are other considerations beyond valuation.Regulatory timeline and national concerns will come into play.Western Digital can use its JV terms to offer a discounted bid.Western Digital remains on pole.,"Developments so farWestern Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) has sent a scathing letter to Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) management stating - 1) the transfer of the venture's rights to a new chip unit, which was split off recently without the U.S. firm's consent, was a ""very serious breach""; 2) WDC wants to enter into exclusive talks; 3) the other bidders would be problematic for Toshiba, with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) in particular giving them grave concerns; and 4) bids thus far at ~2-3 trillion yen are well above fair and supportable value, citing analysts' estimates of around 1.5 trillion yen.Bidding thus far has been narrowed to 4 main bidders. The highest bid came from Hon Hai/Foxconn (OTCPK:HNHAF) at $27 billion, while Reuters reported a lower offer of $18 billion, making the bid range $18 billion-$27 billion. The Broadcom-Silverlake had been pegged at ~$18 billion bid last week, but Reuters recently reported a $23 billion bid. WDC's bid amount is not officially known, but Asahi News has pegged it in the 1-2 trillion yen range or $9-$18 billion, which fits WDC's recent letter citing fair value of ~1.5 trillion yen. SK Hynix and KKR have also put in bids in line with WDC of ~1-2 trillion yen.It's about more than just the priceIn a fair world, the highest bid would win the auction. But bidding for Toshiba Memory will ultimately come down to a number of considerations, including timing, valuations and national interests.For one, Toshiba is a national concern and the Japanese government is prepared to block the memory business sale to bidders it deems could pose risks to national security. What this implies is that 1) non-allies such as Chinese/Taiwanese bidders will lose out; 2) the Japanese government is unlikely to bid for the asset or ""bail out"" Toshiba; and 3) according to the Nikkei Asian Review, Toshiba President Satoshi Tsunakawa will not sell the memory business to ""companies in countries that have friction with Japan"".Another key consideration for Toshiba will be the bidding timeline. Toshiba's aim is to finalize a buyer before its shareholder meeting in late June with plans to close the sale by March 2018. With this in mind, and WDC's ability to invoke its legal rights under the JV for exclusive talks, the bidding process is set to be delayed. In this vein, WDC is likely to be chosen in the case of a majority sale, as, in addition to the sale price, time constraints (approval under antitrust law must be obtained by end-FY3/18) mean that current partners face the lowest barriers compared with other NAND makers.The Western Digital roadblockWestern Digital is demanding exclusive negotiating rights to acquire Toshiba Memory, arguing that any sale of the business requires WDC's approval. Note that through the legacy SanDisk-Toshiba JV, WDC has consent rights with respect to transfer of interests and assets.The JV (50.1% Toshiba, 49.9% SanDisk) is a subsidiary of the memory business that Toshiba is selling. The subsidiary also consists of a few other plants and Toshiba's own IP/manufacturing from the chip to SSD stage. Under the joint venture, WDC and Toshiba jointly own three chip fabs in Yokkaichi (Flash Partners, Flash Alliance, Flash Forward).(Source: SEC)Here's the relevant quote from the JV agreement:One interpretation of the JV agreement is that any change of control of one of the JV's parents requires the other's consent (e.g. WDC's acquisition of SanDisk required Toshiba approval). Another interpretation is that if Toshiba sells a majority stake in Toshiba Memory, it will face no restrictions and be free to sell to buyers other than WDC. Toshiba's stand thus far has been that WDC's approval is not needed and that the business will be sold to the buyer that best appreciates the business's future value.Western Digital remains on poleNow that WDC has played a more active role in negotiations, Toshiba will need to decide whether to focus more on price or regulatory certainty, i.e. meeting FY 3/18 deadline for regulatory approval. WDC still looks to be the leading candidate but price remains the bottleneck, and WDC will be stretched in matching the other bidders' lofty valuations. Toshiba and WDC may not have had the best of relations since the SanDisk acquisition, and negotiations could prove rocky. But regulatory certainty, constraints from the Flash ventures JV agreement and the Japanese government's preference for an ally - i.e., no China/Taiwan - should keep WDC in pole position for this acquisition.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4078585,101850,2017-06-04T20:55:32-04:00,We now have a timeline for finalization of the bidding process.WDC is in pole position.But may opt to accept a minority stake as part of a consortium.Which helps relieve balance sheet pressure.Valuations for the asset will likely settle around the 2-trillion yen mark.,"Developments so farIn my previous article covering bidding developments, I noted that Toshiba's attempt to circumvent Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) consent rights (following the empty threats to block WDC staff access to JV infrastructure) would violate the terms of their JV agreement. To recap, here's what Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) (TOSBY) attempted:As it turns out, another week, another bluff called by WDC.On June 2nd, Toshiba reversed its prior move, reverting its NAND JV assets back to the parent company from the subsidiary Toshiba Memory Corporation (""TMC"") that it is trying to monetize. According to Bloomberg, Toshiba sent a letter to Western Digital's Chief Legal Officer, notifying the company that it is moving the assets from the joint venture (Flash Ventures) back to the parent company (Toshiba). Toshiba's view is that a transfer of the assets back to the parent company would make Western Digital's claims a moot point (that the split violated WDC's consent rights i.e. consent rights that were required given that this did not reflect a change of control).Note that the TMC spinoff from Toshiba ParentCo was made on April 1, following which, Toshiba threatened arbitration. The fact that Toshiba's latest move was done at this point in time was not coincidental. Toshiba's management likely had an eye on the June 5th deadline (which would mark a 60-day violation and trigger an 'Event of Default' by the breaching party), following which WDC could, in theory, ask arbitration courts to have Toshiba turn over the JV interests to WDC at a pre-determined amount.Toshiba's response has a few key implications for the ongoing bidding process:It validates WDC's claim that Toshiba is bound by the JV operating agreement giving WDC consent rights. Looking through the posturing and tactical manoeuvrings, this is a big sign that Toshiba is aware that its hands are bound by the terms of the JV. WDC holds the upper hand and negotiations will be done on WDC's terms. It validates the key role the Innovation Network Corporation of Japan (""INCJ"") is set to play in the bidding process. On 30 May, INCJ was reported to have confirmed interest in a potential investment in Toshiba Memory, but had deferred a decision amidst uncertainty thrown up by the tussle between Toshiba and WDC. Toshiba's latest move will help alleviate INCJ concerns. The timeliness of Toshiba's move indicates higher legal uncertainty for other bidders that may be engaged in round 2 bids. Even if the other bidders pay a significant premium to WDC's bid, they may not be able to overturn the legal hold WDC has on Toshiba.For those of us hoping for quick resolution, we now have more visibility as Toshiba has provided a timeline for the sale. The reversion of the NAND JV assets back to its parentco was effective on 3rd June. Following which, Toshiba plans to narrow the bidding pool to one final bidder by mid-June and sign a deal by its shareholders' meeting on June 28. The transaction close is set for Toshiba's FY2017 close (year ending March 31, 2018), when delisting risk will be front and centre.More significant developments are expected this week as CEO Steve Milligan is set to travel to Tokyo to meet with Toshiba's president Satoshi Tsunakawa.Toshiba on the RopesWith Toshiba already weighed down by a long list of severe issues, the legal dispute with WDC is not something it needs right now. Here's where things stand - WDC management continues to echo its belief that any transfer of Toshiba's stake in the JV to TMC without legacy SanDisk/WDC's agreement is a breach of contractual terms. Toshiba, on the other hand, interprets the JV agreement differently (although its recent reversal suggests otherwise). The official Toshiba stance is that by buying back the JV stake held by TMC and reverting the status of direct investment in the JV to Toshiba Corporation, this removes all grounds for WDC's complaint.Toshiba's posturing thus far has been an attempt to boost valuations but if this process were to run for 16-24 months (per comparable arbitration timelines), this would push Toshiba further to the brink. If anything, Toshiba's troubles have increased the necessity for a quick sale. Some key reasons why: 1) Toshiba urgently needs the proceeds from the sale of Toshiba Memory to raise funds to cover the mounting Westinghouse-related liabilities; 2) if Toshiba does not eliminate its negative equity problem by end-FY3/18, it could face delisting (note that Toshiba has already recorded two consecutive years of a negative equity position); 3) force Toshiba to seek more funds from the banks. Credit will be hard to come by considering Toshiba has used Toshiba Memory as collateral to secure its debt; and 4) increase bankruptcy risk as Toshiba will need to survive that much longer through more expensive financing.The WDC-INCJ ConsortiumAccording to Bloomberg, the current INCJ consortium bid (thus far excluding WDC, which had been offered a ~20% stake), stands around ¥1.8 trillion. WDC's last reported offer stood at ~¥1.5 trillion yen (through preferred shares, while ¥500bn will come from INCJ and DBJ in the form of common shares through an SPV). By comparison, Broadcom reportedly offered ¥2.2 trillion ($20 billion), illustrating the premium required to wrest Toshiba memory from WDC.While Broadcom would face easier antitrust regulatory hurdles (WDC's acquisition would create a clear #2 player), WDC's legal hold over Toshiba memory, coupled with a potential partnership with INCJ and DBJ (state-backed entities), puts a WDC consortium in pole position.WDC Can Get It Done Cheap(-er)We've come a long way since first round bidding which drew bids of¥2-3 trillion ($18.3 billion to $27.5 billion). Since then, the bidding process has narrowed as WDC's legal hold over Toshiba Memory became clearer (e.g. Toshiba's reversal from its prior stance to block WDC staff access from its facilities and spin off its JV to a new subsidiary). To recap, WDC has bid ~¥1.5tn through preferred shares, with INCJ and DBJ making up the remainder through common shares while Broadcom's offer stands at ~¥2.2 trillion. Outside of WDC's legal actions, other external constraints may prevent Toshiba from securing maximum value (~¥2-3 trillion) from Toshiba Memory.For one, METI's concerns over national interests (e.g. blocking a China sale) limits the pool of bidders. As it stands, ¥2 trillion is the minimum Toshiba will accept for a modest surplus to cover other costs (e.g. restructuring) beyond the Westinghouse-related liabilities and part of the outstanding debt. Prior to WDC's recent actions, a higher valuation might have been more feasible but the increased uncertainty has depressed prices and made the inclusion of WDC as important as DBJ and INCJ's participation.Secondly, INCJ's participation in a consortium increases its negotiating leverage and would likely cap potential valuations at ~¥2 trillion. State backing aside, the INCJ may not have more than ~¥1.3tr for investment even after the sale of Renesas shares. Yet, METI pressure may force INCJ into pushing for a stake of at least 50%. A lower deal value would be less favorable to current shareholders of Toshiba but ¥2 trillion would be enough to swing Toshiba back into a positive equity position.WDC Prepared to Accept a Minority StakeRecent press reports following speculation regarding a INCJ-WDC bid have suggested that WDC may opt to take a minority stake instead of a majority stake in TMC. This seems increasingly likely given METI pressure and Toshiba's strong reaction (reverting NAND assets back to JV) in response to INCJ concerns surrounding the WDC dispute. A WDC partnership with financial buyers, especially Japanese parties such as INCJ and DBJ, would imply no change to the industry structure (reducing antitrust hurdles) and less cash/debt infusion by WDC in exchange for higher equity earnings.On the plus side, this seems like a less cyclical and capital intensive way for WDC to protect its interests although there is a flip side - a minority stake would preclude WDC from significant accretion potential.The bigger the consortium (e.g. WDC, KKR, INCJ and DBJ vs. WDC and INCJ), the more likely WDC will accept a minority stake. With more financial backing in an expanded consortium, WDC's overall bid value also has a higher ceiling. On paper, it looks like a nice balance for both parties - less capital infusion for WDC in exchange for earnings while Toshiba gets a higher price for its asset. Naturally, getting all parties aligned will be tricky but a transaction along these lines would be completed in a more positive manner.To note, WDC + financial buyer has been my favoured option from the start and I view latest updates on this front as reinforcing this view.

4067658,21815,2017-05-01T23:06:57-04:00,"Western Digital caught analysts by surprise with a very bullish guidance for the coming quarters.The near future is good with substantial amounts of synergies from recent acquisitions, and a strong NAND market will produce substantial free cash flow.With the help of that cash flow, the company can deleverage.Longer-term worries about the secular decline in hard disks and a possible turn in flash memory are not gone though.","Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), given up for perennial decline through the advent of flash memory and forced into supposed 'shotgun' acquisitions of the likes of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies and SanDisk, the companies fortunes have actually perked up considerably. Management is doing a fine job.The company also has a joint venture with Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF). As the latter is seeking to sell its memory business, we have to wait and see what happens to that, but the company was rather reassuring on this front on the Q3CC (emphasis ours):Q3 ResultsThese were rather good - both revenues and earnings beat expectations. Some highlights:The difference between non-GAAP and GAAP metrics is large and includes intangible amortization, charges associated with the acquisitions, and stock-based compensation. The $1B in operational cash flow should put the most impressionable minds at ease at least a little.GuidanceThe highlight of the guidance was certainly the EPS of $12 for calendar-year 2017 (which includes the first two quarters of fiscal 2018). That's massively (nearly 50%) above the average analyst expectations of $8.13, and really tops the most optimistic analyst ($8.66), but note that these are for fiscal 2017.It's curious that the stock price didn't react in a more forceful way after this. If we take Q3 ($2.39) and the top end of Q4 guidance ($2.65), that amounts to $5.04, so the second half of the year should be good, with quarters achieving $3.50 in EPS on average.As a side note, we're not sure Jim Cramer is aware of the fact that the $12 per share guidance pertains to the calendar year and not the fiscal-year 2017, as he argued that this was 50% above what analysts expect. It could be that he totaled all the analysts' fiscal 2018 Q1 and Q2 expectations, but it is striking that the 50% fits neatly with the analyst expectations for fiscal 2017.Growth driversThe company is booming because of a combination of stable HDD market and a strong flash market, driving sales and margins higher. Further, financial gains come from achieving substantial synergies from the acquisitions of SanDisk and especially Hitachi (OTCPK:HTHIF). From the Q3CC:These combined forces have boosted margins, at least on a non-GAAP basis, by 650 basis points over the past 12 months.Higher margins come from the shift to high capacity HDDs (10 and 12 terabyte) while flash prices are helpful even if the ramp to 3D NAND flash is difficult for all.Cash flow:This enables the company to deleverage, paying off debt and/or refinancing cheaper. The company has decreased its net debt by $1.5B since the beginning of the fiscal year. It also (per Q3CC):It is also using the funds to ramp R&D for future growth:The company is making good progress on both its main product lines, with HDDs moving to 10 and even 12 terabyte products for corporate clients. These products generate higher margins. It is also successfully making the difficult transition in 3D NAND (from Q3CC):ValuationOn a price/free cash flow basis the shares are already approaching previous highs:And the same holds even more for EV/EBITDA:While EV/EBITDA seems a little stretched, as long as it can keep generating substantial free cash flow with which to deleverage, we don't see much of a problem. Given the bullish outlook for the coming four quarters, that seems pretty likely.RisksTo start with the first, HDDs are not becoming obsolete anytime soon. There is still a good deal of demand from PCs and servers. For the latter, they still offer a considerable cost advantage over SSDs, which is especially relevant for data that is less frequently accessed, which is why cloud companies often use hybrid storage.What also greatly helps is that the HDD market has basically become a duopoly, with Western Digital and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) as the last ones standing. There still is Toshiba, but we'll have to see what happens to it, as discussed above.However, declining sales of HDDs are still expected, and via operational deleveraging, this could very well hurt margins. HDDs still consists mostly of Western's sales by far. So far, we see little of the margin compression with gross margins actually rising.We have to say that this is on a non-GAAP basis, and the difference between GAAP and non-GAAP figures is really substantial as explained above.By now, fears about Western Digital having overpaid for the SanDisk acquisition should mostly disappear, even if that fear might have had a considerable amount of truth at the time. But what we see now is that the synergies are materializing, and the company has mastered the transition to 3D NAND.The NAND flash market is supposed to be strong for quite a while, but we see here some of the same investor angst as in Micron (NASDAQ:MU). The latest Micron quarter greatly exceeded expectations, but this has given little in terms of lift to the share price.For Micron, the main concerns are whether the good times in DRAM and flash can last, with investors looking ahead half a year or so. For Western Digital, something similar seems to be at work, investors worrying when the operational deleveraging from falling HDD sales is kicking in and the flash cycle turns.Conclusion and technical analysisThe company is confident that the good times will last, at least to mid-2018, so we think the shares still have some mileage in them.The shares didn't respond overwhelmingly to what most certainly was good news. However, over the weekend, several houses have upped their targets for Western, most notably Needham with a $138 price target.We've already mentioned Micron post earnings, and the situation really is quite similar, a strong upward trading band and an earnings beat that took the shares from above the band to within it. The latter seems like the worst case scenario for Western to us.It's unlikely that the shares will fall below the upward channel with such a bullish near-time guidance, so a buy opportunity emerges when it falls back into the channel, especially should it go to the lower band.But the party isn't going to last forever, secular forces are likely to reassert themselves at some time, even if that perspective has moved further out."
4074825,101850,2017-05-19T14:58:06-04:00,"WDC has moved even further ahead in the race for Toshiba Memory.WDC's filing for arbitration is a key bargaining chip.Further delays will risk delisting and endanger Toshiba's solvency.WDC is in a position to negotiate for a discount.With financial backing, the transaction is set to be accretive.","Since my last update over a month ago, things have gotten a lot worse for Toshiba and a lot better for Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). To be clear, I have always maintained that Western Digital is by and large, the favorite for Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) memory and this is looking increasingly the case.What's New?The legal dispute over whether the Toshiba memory sale requires Western Digital/ legacy Sandisk's approval turned ugly as Toshiba explicitly threatened to lock out WDC employees. Of course, it was all a bluff really and WDC successfully called it. After all the posturing, Toshiba finally decided not to block WDC employees from access to jointly operated NAND fabs according to the Keizai Shumbun. One could be forgiven for drawing a big sigh of relief though as Toshiba's retreat reduces the operational risk given WDC's decision to move for arbitration.Hiroshige Seko, Japan's trade minister, also maintained that the government will not interfere in matter concerning private sector companies and noted the importance of a WDC and Toshiba cooperation. And who could blame him really? Toshiba has backed itself into a precarious position right now with little (if any) leverage. I highly doubt the Japanese government will stand by and watch Toshiba delisted though. Behind the scenes, The Innovation Network Corporation for Japan (INCJ), Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., (NYSE:KKR) and Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) are preparing to launch a bid in the second round of bidding (set for Friday, will probably be finalized later though). According to the Sankei Shimbun in late April, ¥100bn will be committed from the DBJ, several hundreds of billions of yen from the INCJ, and the bulk of the remainder from KKR. Most importantly though, WDC was reported to be set to commit a small amount. Since then, news reports have changed but a consortium looks to be in the works.Earlier in the week (15th May), Toshiba announced an unaudited financial update with the following guidance - 1) the memory business should achieve 20% return on sales in FY16 and 2) memory expectation for FY17 is reduced by ~3% YoY. The early announcement was unprecedented but was triggered by its failure to complete the auditing process at this point. Toshiba aims to submit its securities report at the end of June working together with auditor PwC Aarata.Most importantly though, Toshiba does not expect its contract with WDC/ legacy Sandisk to interfere with the bidding process (the second round of bidding deadline is set for 19 May). In the meantime, WDC's decision to move for arbitration stands.Arbitration - An Expected Next Step(Source: Flash Ventures Operating Agreement)Given details in the Flash Ventures joint venture operating agreement (discussed earlier here), it should come as no surprise that the meeting between both parties' CEOs failed to resolve the companies' differences. Following WDC's decision to file a Request for Arbitration, Toshiba will have to respond over the next 30 days. Following which, the process of arbitration will begin. The process includes three arbitrators - one from WDC, one from Toshiba, and either an ICC nominated or agreed upon third arbitrator.Here's what really swings it in WDC favor - arbitrations like this could take anywhere from 16-24 months to finalize - a process that would not only endanger Toshiba's listing status (recall the Toshiba's timeline of end-FY3/18 for solvency), but also its chances of staying afloat (bankruptcy or at the very least, a bailout, is a very real risk here).Toshiba's Has Already Breached The AgreementAs if their hand wasn't bad enough already, Toshiba looks to have materially breached the JV agreements by sneakily transferring the JV interests to a newly created affiliate on April 1 ( ""Toshiba Memory""), which it is now in the process of selling. The affiliate was created following Toshiba's attempts to obtain WDC's consent, which would seem to validate the merits of Western Digital's consent rights.Going back to the JV agreement, SanDisk and Toshiba agreed to protect their interest in the joint ventures by prohibiting transfers without the consent of the other party. Toshiba's attempt to spin out its joint venture interest into an affiliate and then sell that affiliate is explicitly prohibited without SanDisk's consent. Toshiba cannot evade SanDisk's consent rights by transferring its JV interests to an Affiliate with or without SanDisk's consent and then effecting a purported change of control of that Affiliate.(Source: Flash Ventures Agreement)Here's how Toshiba attempted to circumvent the agreement - 1) it would spin off its JV interests to the newly formed affiliate, and 2) it would sell an interest in that affiliate to a third party. Effecting a purported change of control of that affiliate is really Toshiba's last ditch effort to get a better hand, but make no mistake, Toshiba has breached the agreement.Toshiba has pointed the finger at WDC for similarly breaching the consent requirement in the Sandisk acquisition, but that differs materially from Toshiba memory as Sandisk was acquired in whole, with no change in JV interest.If Toshiba does accept a bid without WDC's approval or involvement, WDC could file for an injunction against Toshiba to completely block the sale. Thus far, WDC/ legacy Sandisk has not given approval, citing insufficient disclosure of information on Toshiba Memory.(Source: The Register)In the meantime, disruptions in Flash Ventures operations seem unlikely. Toshiba's decision to drop its threat to block WDC employee's access validates the fact that Toshiba holds the losing here - and they know it. Even if Toshiba disrupted operations, WDC still holds the right to 50% of the fab JV output. This sale will however, be a key needle mover for Toshiba and I don't expect them to go down without a fight. The magic number here is ¥2trn, which would 1) enable them to turn around their negative equity position, 2) forego the option of completely relinquishing the JV stake and 3) forego an additional capital increase to fund losses if its share of the unit was sold.The Remaining BiddersWith round two of the bidding process underway (set to end on the 19th), a quick stocktake of the bidders still left standing is warranted. The main bidders seem to be 1) A KKR consortium. Along with the INCJ and the DBJ, this would be the ideal candidate from Toshiba and the Japanese government's point of view. Why? Because KKR's motive's would presumably be financial - typically, a private equity fund invests in a business with the aim of exiting after enhancing its enterprise value. If KKR exits through an IPO after a few years. Toshiba's memory business would then potentially remain in Japanese control over the longer-term (vs. a strategic player like WDC who would be in it for the long haul).2) WDC. Western Digital's involvement has also been floated around but it seems uncertain if they will submit a standalone bid or join forces with the KKR consortium. If the WDC + PE option comes into play, this would likely be very accretive for the stock as not only will WDC be able to negotiate a lower valuation, it will not need to commit significant financial backing.Other major candidates who remain in the race include 3) Hon Hai (OTCPK:HNHAF) + Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBY) + Sharp (OTCPK:SHCAY), 4) Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) + Silver Lake Partners and 5) SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) + Bain Capital.Stay Long WDCIt seems increasingly likely that not only will WDC be involved party in the purchase of Toshiba Memory, but it will also get it done at a discount. The Goldilocks scenario would be an exclusive and essentially uncompetitive bidding process which WDC will leverage into a favorable price for the asset. The announcement of a favorable transaction will be a near-term positive for the shares. This, coupled with its solid fundamentals (growth prospects of the NAND industry remain strong, much better than HDD), keeps me interested in the stock.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4067635,102404,2017-05-01T20:31:00-04:00,"Western Digital is not a bargain right now, but despite the 150% gain since the low of $35 it is not excessively overvalued.The high debt levels as consequence of the SanDisk acquisition pose a certain risk, but seem manageable during the next several years.In order to get a realistic intrinsic value, we can’t just look at last year’s revenue and net income, but have to look at the bigger picture.The quarterly data shows that Western Digital managed the turnaround, and revenue as well as net income are growing again.","A few days ago Mark Bern published a very informative article about Western Digital Corporation (NYSE: WDC) and raised the question if the company is “an investment or a speculation?” As result of different concerns regarding WDC the author ended the article with the conclusion that the stock is rather speculative. Although I won’t recommend buying Western Digital at current price levels, I'm pretty pleased with my investment so far and will explain why I'm rather bullish than bearish on the stock although there might be some issues with the company. We will look at the future potential of data storage, we will look at the development of revenue and net income and end the article with an intrinsic value calculation. But we will start the discussion by looking at the most worrisome aspect – the high debt levels.The debt: Rather concerningFor many years Western Digital had almost no debt (and hence a very low D/E), but on May 12, 2016, the acquisition of SanDisk was officially completed and in order to finance the transaction WDC took on several billions in debt. On December 30, 2016, the total debt was $13,299 million. Six months earlier the total debt was about $17.5 billion and therefore WDC already managed to reduce the outstanding debt by $4.2 billion (but had to reduce the cash and cash equivalents from $8,151 million to $4,940 million). Most of the outstanding debt needs to be paid back in the years between 2020 and 2024. The D/E ratio of 1.24 can give us a first hint - that the debt levels are not extreme, but can be a burden for the company.In the last 10-Q (page 55) the company provides a good overview of the expected costs due to interest expenses and debt that needs to be repaid (plus some other expenses), which helps us to get a feeling if the debt is manageable by generated revenue.In the last two quarters the company had an operating income of $525 million and $545 million – if we expect that WDC can at least manage to keep up that level we would have an annual operating income of about $2.1 billion[1]. Under the premise that WDC keeps the dividend at least at $2.00 there is $517 million necessary for annual dividend payments. If we also take into account that WDC has about $5.6 billion in cash right now and also consider the expected costs due to interest expenses and debt that needs to be repaid (chart above) at the end of 2021 the money won’t be enough. Western Digital will therefore either have to take on new debt or the revenue and operating income has to be even higher in the next few years. As the expenses for R&D and SG&A are still significantly higher due to the acquisition of SanDisk (according to 10-Q), there is a good chance that the operating expenses decrease again in the next quarters and we can expect a higher operating income.Although Western Digital’s plans to pay back the debt are very ambitious and they want to be debt free in a rather short time and they can easily try to restructure the debt and have a few more years to pay back the debt, the high debt levels and high interest expenses are a little bit worrisome.The outlook: Rather bullish The high debt levels are particularly worrisome if – for some reason – revenue would decline. And Mark Bern is absolutely right by pointing out in his article that WDC would be in big trouble if some technology disruption makes the technology developed by WDC obsolete. It is certainly a risk that technology companies (and the shareholders) have to consider (and maybe live with) that technology can change very quickly. And while it seems unlikely that a company like Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) will go under because coffee is replaced with a different, better coffee or some other beverage, this can happen to data storage technology.But aside from that particular risk, we look at an increasing demand in data storage in the next several years (and probably decades). On the one hand WDC expects that social media platforms will lead to rapid growth in the creation, sharing and retention of high definition video, high resolution images and other big data files. On the other hand, there will be an increasing demand for data access and big data analytics which will increase the need for data storage at both the local level and at the off-site, network-accessed or “cloud” levels.Pictures taken with smartphone cameras, a video taken with a GoPro (NASDAQ: GPRO) Hero action camera and everything uploaded to Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), Twitter (NYSE: TWTR), YouTube or Instagram. Nobody will deny that ordinary people – at least in the western developed countries – produce more and more data that needs to be stored. Additionally, a lot of content needs to be available all the time – music, movies, TV shows or other kind of content need to get streamed night and day and require a lot of storage capacity (and it is not enough to store it once, but several times as there are many different people who want to access the content simultaneously). But not just ordinary people like you and me need more and more data storage capacity. Most corporations around the world have digitalized their archives and documents are saved for a very long time, not to mention the enormous amounts of data that are collected by smartphones, fitness-trackers, surveillance cameras and so on.WDC has no real moat to protect its business, but at least the company is an industry leader in the declining though still important HDD market, which is only divided between three companies right now – Western Digital has 43% market share. The two competitors Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX) and Toshiba Corp. (OTCPK: OTCPK:TOSBF) have 39% and 17%. Western Digital also saw the writing on the wall and by the SanDisk merger positioned itself well in the SSD market, where Western Digital has already a market share of 16% (second place behind Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), which holds 38.8% market share). All in all I think Western Digital is well positioned to profit from the growing demand in storage capacity (HDD as well as SSD).The numbers: Rather promisingIf we take a look at revenue and net income for the last 10 years we see a big increase in revenue from 2007 till 2013 (about 180% increase in just 6 years), but a steady decline since then. In the last three years, Western Digital didn’t seem to be able to stop the revenue decline. If we look at the net income we see high volatility (a good year followed a rather bad one), but from 2007 to 2012 WDC almost managed to triple its profit. While revenue was only declining a few percentage points in the last three years, net income dropped over 80% in 2016.If we just look at the annual data we can only state that WDC is no company to invest in, as it is in terrible condition and there is absolutely no sign for a turnaround. But if we look at the quarterly data instead, the picture looks a little different. We see the same decline in revenue and net income since 2013 and we see the two bad quarters Q4/16 and Q1/17 with a loss of $366 million each quarter. But we also can spot something else: since Q3/16 the revenue decline has not just stopped but revenue in the last three quarters was higher than in 2013 before the drama began. Revenue for the last four quarters was $17,746 million and therefore significantly higher than in 2013. It is also true that net income isn’t as high as it used to be before, but the net income turnaround (which started a few quarters later) is also visible in the chart.One swallow certainly doesn’t make a summer, but the data for the last quarters is at least a strong hint - that WDC managed the turnaround in revenue as well as in net income and will at least return to previous levels regarding revenue and net income. The company’s own guidance for the next quarter states about $4.8 billion in revenue and a Non-GAAP (!) income of about $780 million.The value: Rather over- than undervaluedUsing a similar net income and free cash flow as in the last two quarters and also assuming that net income will stay more or less the same (only a slight growth similar to GDP growth) for the next 10 years, we get an intrinsic value of $48.06 (using a 10% discount rate). But if we assume that WDC will manage to have a similar net income as in the years 2012 and 2014 and will grow similar to GDP (not a high growth rate, by the way) in the next 10 years, the intrinsic value – again using a 10% discount rate – would be about $80 and therefore WDC would be fairly valued right now. I'm well aware that analyst estimates are in many cases exaggerated, but according to Morningstar the estimated EPS for the next two years are $7.24 and $8.65 and therefore significantly higher than in 2012 and 2014. And especially if we consider the acquisition of SanDisk, Western Digital should be able to generate higher revenue and higher earnings than before the merger and net income of 2012 and 2014 should be exceeded. But on the other hand we also have to consider the risk due to the high debt levels and a bigger margin of safety is recommended and hence WDC is not a buy for me right now.ConclusionSince the lows in May 2016 the stock gained about 150% without a major correction and therefore we shouldn’t be surprised if the stock declines more than just a few percent in the near future. Although I think it is too late to buy, I won’t sell any shares. The company is certainly not undervalued any more, but I also don’t think that it is extremely overvalued (like some other stocks are right now). Past performance doesn’t guarantee future success, but I think it is at least worth mentioning that WDC gained over 4400% since the lows in 2001 – a performance not many stocks can match. One last point: Stephan D. Milligan bought 22,500 shares in May 2016 at the price of $45.53 per share (after he sold about 100,000 shares in 2015 at a price between $85 and $110). The CEO demonstrated not only a good timing, but with an order volume of over $1 million I think it is safe to say that the CEO is confident in his own company.[1] I think that Q2 and Q3 of a year provide a good average of the operating income as the first quarter was usually the strongest and the fourth quarter usually the weakest and the second and third quarter were somewhere in between (overview over the last quarters)."
4064477,22742,2017-04-24T02:25:58-04:00,How I define the difference between investing and speculation.Can Western Digital win the bid for Toshiba memory? Should I care?Taking a look at Western Digital by the numbers.,"Investing or Speculating?Everyone can have their own definitions but here are mine. If one buys a stock with the intent of selling it in a few days, weeks or months I consider it to be speculating. If one buys a stock with the intent of holding it for many years I consider it to be investing. Plain and simple.Under the above definitions, an investment in any one of many managed mutual funds could also be considered speculating, since the turnover in some such funds exceeds 100 percent per year. The owner of the fund shares may not think that s/he is speculating, but by extension of the investing activities of the fund management, stocks are being bought for short-term holding periods or speculation. Even if one holds the shares of the fund for many years without selling s/he may, in fact, have been speculating all along since the fund manager(s) was buying and selling stocks almost constantly throughout the holding period. The investor may think s/he is a conservative buy-and-hold investor but the truth may be something far different.Please do not take this the wrong way as I believe that speculation is a legitimate investing style and works well for some. It is just not my cup of tea. I do not have any urge to go to Las Vegas and try my luck at the gaming tables. I am not particularly fond of roller coaster rides either, especially the figurative sort like riding a stock market up and down over and over again. When stocks get to what I consider relatively high valuations, I begin to hedge and stay hedged until after the next bear market. Then, when stock valuations have become bargains (or at least very reasonable) I add new positions and increase my favorite holdings. It may be boring but it has worked out well for me and many others.Can Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) win the bidding war for Toshiba memory?One article I read recently on Seeking Alpha reasons that Western Digital should have the inside track. The author made some very good points, but did not convince me of the outcome. You can find the full article here. In the article, the author indicated that Western Digital should have the inside track because of its joint venture agreement with Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY) (acquired with SanDisk) and because of more favorable regulatory inclinations of the Japanese government relative to other bidders. But if Western Digital makes it difficult for Toshiba to achieve a market value for its assets I really do not see that as a strong selling point to convince Toshiba to do a deal. The more Western Digital plays hardball the more willing I think Toshiba will become to consider other offers.Toshiba needs cash and lots of it. Western Digital wants to expand its flash memory business as cheaply as possible. These two opposing views/needs/desires do not necessarily lead to a happy marriage arrangement. I do not feel the need to go into the details of the bids and rationale since it is covered well in the article linked above; but to my thinking, this asset sale is more wide open than many may believe.What if Western Digital were to win? There are those who believe that such an outcome would be a great long-term win. Sure, Western Digital will add lots of revenue in an area with good growth potential. More mobile devices (and even other electronics) are using more flash memory, rather than hard drive memory. The theory for the continued expansion of use and growth in flash memory sales is that as the price (cost to original equipment manufacturers) comes down flash memory will become more competitive. But therein lies the catch: ""when the price falls enough."" If the price falls faster than the cost to produce then margins will get squeezed and profits will not rise as fast as may be expected. Revenue will increase as long as unit volumes keep rising faster than the price falls. But this is a very tricky game that has not turned out well for many industries, especially in the fast-evolving technology sector. Remember how solar companies were going to put oil companies out of business (or something like that)? The cost was going to come down and everyone would want a solar unit on the roof. Then price competition drove down margins and profits turned into losses. I am not saying this is going to happen to memory, but just think that product that becomes commoditized could become subject to such circumstances. If the Chinese decide they want to dominate the memory industry prices would drop. Technologically they may not be in that position yet but give them time. They have a way of obtaining the tech they need to carry out plans and they are not afraid of pricing. Again, this may not happen but it is among the possibilities.The point I am trying to make is that the perceived moat around the Western Digital business may not be impenetrable for very long, even if it can find a way to buy the Toshiba memory unit.Then there is the potential problem of funding another huge acquisition so soon after the SanDisk deal. The company would probably need to find partners to raise enough cash. That would probably dilute the benefits that would otherwise accrue to Western Digital. What would it need to give up to entice the right partners into the deal?There is also the concern that I would have with piling on additional debt at this time, not to mention concerns about the quality of current operations. So, now I want to dig into the financials and look at ratios and trends. After all, if this is a great company that I would want to invest in for the long term it should be evident in the financials.Western Digital by the NumbersI will start with a look at revenue. I like to gauge the health of a company by looking at total reported revenue, not revenue per share, because too often companies tend to make per-share data better through the misallocation of capital, like buying back lots of shares when the price is dear. Looking at total revenue gives me a better sense of whether a company is growing consistently.Chart by Mark Bern, CFANotice that annual percentage change in revenue has been trending downward for four years, despite M&A (merger and acquisition) activity. It has been negative for three years. Total revenue has also been trending lower for the last three years. This does not appear to me to be a thriving business so far. Ah, but change is in the air, you say. Well then, perhaps I should look at the trend in earnings then. Surely that will look better.Chart by Mark Bern, CFAUh oh! There is no real trend line to be found except for the last three years and going from earnings of $1.5 billion to a loss of $423 million is not very encouraging to me. But, the pundits say the future will surely brighten with another huge acquisition (Toshiba memory) if the company can raise the cash. Then we should take a look at the balance sheet and cash flows to see how rock solid this company must be. First, I will look at FCF (free cash flow) versus funds used to pay dividends and buy back stocks.Chart by Mark Bern, CFAFinally, a chart that does not look so bad; FCF is more than dividends and buybacks in every single year for the last ten. However, it does seem that FCF is falling year-over-year for the last couple of years. And it also appears that the amount left over to help pay down debt is narrowing; much further and there will not be anything left to service more debt if it is needed. And if Western Digital wins the bidding war for Toshiba memory that debt service could reduce its ability to buy back as much stock in the future. Retiring debt could reduce the ability to cover a rising dividend. Maybe the dividend will not rise. But before we jump to conclusions I want to look at outstanding debt and see if it is manageable.Chart by Mark Bern, CFAOh well, this does not bode well for a company that may need some flexibility in its capital structure to compete in the future. What if, heaven forbid, the technology that the company has developed and may purchase from Toshiba becomes obsolete before the debt load is paid down adequately? Well, of course that could never happen because we all know that technology like data storage does not change much over time, or does it? If you are considering buying stock in this company you should probably know the answer to that question first. I will give you a hint: the answer is yes it does, but by how much and how often is hard to determine until after the disruptive technology is launched. By then it is too late.Valuing Western DigitalSince the TTM (trailing twelve months) EPS (earnings per share) is negative, I will not try to determine the value of this company based upon a price/earnings multiple basis. I also do not want to guess what the growth rate in the dividend might be going forward because I am not even certain that the company will be able to continue its current dividend should its bid for Toshiba memory be accepted. What I am left with is looking at the net present value of expected future free cash flows. Unfortunately, that picture does not appear too rosy either.Old School Value shows a value based upon DCF (discounted cash flows) of $14.57 per share versus the current market price of $83.11. I wanted to cross-check that with another methodology in computing DCF from Friedrich. Friedrich has a value of $20.89. That is not much better.Now I want to consider two last ratios that I like to use in identifying quality companies at bargain prices. FROIC (free cash flow return on investment) and the Price to Bernhard/Buffett ratio. I consider FROIC to be good if above 10 percent and excellent when it is above 20 percent. I look for companies that consistently produce a ratio above 20 percent. It tells me how much forward free cash flow the company creates with each dollar it invests back into operations. It is a measure of the efficiency of capital allocation and helps identify quality management and solid business models.The Price to Bernhard/Buffett ratio tells us how a company is priced by Wall Street relative to its free cash flow. Here is where a lower ratio is better as it tells me the multiple of the market price to how much free cash it is producing. The lower the price the lower the ratio and, likewise, the higher the free cash flow the lower the ratio. A ratio below 20 is good but a long-term study of this ratio has revealed that when a company has a price to free cash flow below 15, the probability of its stock price outperforming the broad market indices is highly enhanced. If you would like a more thorough explanation of these ratios please take a look at askfriedrich.com or an earlier article I wrote about AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) where I showed the calculations in detail.Western Digital results:FROIC = 4 percentPrice to Buffett/Bernhard ratio = 45.8If you read and understood my explanation of what is good for each of these two ratios you would know that both are terrible. FROIC of 4 percent is too low for my consideration as a long-term investment and the Price to Buffett/Bernhard ratio of 45.8 is well into overbought territory. I consider anything with a ratio of over 30 to be overbought, because at that point the price is generally more than 60 percent above what Friedrich considers fair value. That is getting too rich for me to even consider holding when it gets above 30. So, a ratio of 45.8 is actually more than 52 percent over the price where I would consider selling a stock due to overvaluation.In addition to our Friedrich algorithm, I rely on a tool that I found to be very useful in verifying our work. The Forensic Accounting Stock Tracker (FAST Model) helps identify companies that may be resorting to more financial tricks to make analyst estimates. The model helps pinpoint where management might be aggressive with revenue recognition, cash flows, the balance sheet, and also takes into account valuation and other metrics. Here is an example of the FAST Models results for Western Digital:@DelvechhiojdAs you can see, the company again gets mixed reviews, especially in the Shareholder Yield area.ConclusionIf you are a trader/speculator I wish you well. To answer my question in the title: I would have to consider WDC a speculation. I have no idea if or how to justify Western Digital even at the current price and have no interest in the stock as a long-term investment. Depending upon how the Toshiba memory deal plays out in the press and on Wall Street, some will undoubtedly build a good storyline for why the stock price should rise. Listen if you want and gamble away. I cannot recommend the stock regardless of how the asset sale turns out.

4058002,101850,2017-03-27T01:19:37-04:00,"WDC is the front runner for the Toshiba memory sale.But WDC will need to rope in PE funding to avoid stretching its balance sheet.If WDC can pull it off at the right price, the acquisition is accretive.Overall, WDC is a good bet for the long run.","The Japanese government's recent decision not to bail out Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) regarding the sale of its semiconductor assets, means a Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) acquisition is well and truly on the cards now.(Source: Asia Nikkei)Given WDC's history with Toshiba, the odds are on for a U.S. entity-backed acquisition. Having said that, whether WDC goes it on its own or with the help of private equity funding will be the key development to keep an eye on.For some context, WDC has been flying this year, returning ~15% YTD and ~69% over one year.(Source: Bloomberg)Fundamentals look good as well - underlying demand trends within the industry are strong, with potential for upside to March results.As I'll highlight below, acquiring the Toshiba assets should further improve WDC's NAND position and drive significant accretion to EPS going forward. This is, however, predicated on WDC's ability to fund the deal, preferably through private equity.Overall, with a Toshiba catalyst ahead and the recent acquisition of Sandisk, WDC is well positioned to transform into a medium-agnostic storage provider and certainly looks a good bet for the long run.The Toshiba SaleHere's the gist of the Toshiba memory sale - Toshiba intends to sell a majority or all of its NAND business to offset a $6.3B asset writedown from its nuclear operations. The estimated timeline starts with Toshiba accepting bids until 3/29 and finalizing the decision by Jun-17 according to the Japan Times. The sale follows Toshiba's announcement of a possibility of a goodwill impairment for the acquisition of CB&I Stone & Webster Inc's nuclear construction and integrated services businesses. According to Toshiba, the good ""will reach a level of several 100 billion yen or several billion US dollars, resulting in negative impact on Toshiba's financial results, as a result of impairment of all or part of the goodwill.""The Toshiba semiconductor business on sale is mainly memory, embedded in the Storage & Electronic Devices Solutions business, which includes HDD and NAND. Overall, memory accounted for 404.5B yen (USD $3.58B) and a ~12.4% operating margin, while HDDs generated 221.7B yen (USD $1.96B) in revenue and a ~6.2% operating margin. WDC shares a close relationship with the memory business and already has a JV in place with Toshiba consisting of 3 entities: Flash Partners, Flash Alliance, and Flash Forward (collectively ""Flash Ventures""). Western Digital has 49.9% ownership, while Toshiba maintains 50.1% ownership.(Source: SEC)Bidding ScenariosThus far, the bidders interested include strategic investors such as WDC, MU, SK Hynix, Foxconn, TSMC, and multiple PE firms (Bain Capital, Silverlake, KKR, and various PE entities in China). China is a logical bidder given prior interest in Micron in 2015, a specific Chinese entity has not been suggested as an option.With the level of financial investor interest at hand, it would make the most sense for bidders to form parties to collectively bid on the assets. Of the possible scenarios, a WDC+PE bid to acquire majority of the Toshiba assets makes the most sense.Micron does not quite have the financial flexibility to bid for the Toshiba asset. Even if it did, a sale to SK Hynix/Micron, which is behind Toshiba on 64L 3D NAND, would enable it to catch up and compete on SSDs with WDC. The Chinese would be most disruptive as an acquisition would give China NAND tech access. However, the Japanese government's stance will mean parties like Tsinghua would have difficulty securing regulatory approval. From an antitrust perspective, the NAND space is not as consolidated as DRAM, and should thus be less of an issue considering also the proliferation of Chinese start-ups in the space.Why WDC Is The Best CandidateOn paper at least and given WDC's history with Toshiba, WDC seems like the most obvious candidate to acquire the assets. And it's hard to argue against this - 1) WDC is best positioned to realize synergies given its extensive track record with Toshiba through the JV; 2) Toshiba and the Japanese government would rather sell to US bidders than peers or the Chinese; 3) If WDC can find a suitable PE partner, it will have the financial capability and flexibility to fund the deal without straining its balance sheet and 4) WDC's veto power based on existing Toshiba JV relationship on NAND manufacturing.The base case assumption is that WDC acquires the asset and Toshiba maintains a ~50% ownership stake in the business. The remaining 50% of the business is split another 50-50 between Western Digital and a financial sponsor, meaning that WDC could receive an additional 25% of Toshiba's profit pool.As such, consolidating 25% of Toshiba's NAND business into WDC would result in ~$0.90 in EPS accretion (given gross and operating margins at ~41% and 19%, respectively).How far can WDC stretch its balance sheet?Now, WDC presently has $5.1B of cash outstanding and $13.0B of remaining debt obligations. To fund the Toshiba acquisition, WDC would need to tap the HY debt markets for >$10B. $12B is a feasible amount to raise, given the Sandisk transaction which saw WDC seek $14.1B.This would invariably strain the balance sheet and gross leverage could spike to 3x from ~2.5x currently. However, WDC does still have some additional flexibility to improve leverage ratios in line with how rating agencies view risk factors associated with this deal, given its cash balance. I tend to think the stock would not react too well to the news and WDC will thus, want to rope in a PE partner to help fund the acquisition.Buy On the DipsWDC stock has been range-bound of late, given increased uncertainty around Toshiba's semiconductor asset and its implication to the WDC-Toshiba JV. If WDC can secure partnership with a PE firm to acquire the Toshiba asset, this would allow WDC to vertically integrate its core operations and should provide upside to the stock going forward as WDC would not have to stretch its balance sheet as much.2017 will also be the first full year of Sandisk integration and it will be interesting to see how well management can realize synergies from this and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST).(Source: SEC)Its ability to accelerate and further improve capital allocation, to sustain and expand leadership in enterprise drives will be key drivers. Overall, with the recently closed acquisition of Sandisk, WDC is well positioned to transform into a medium-agnostic storage provider and certainly looks a good bet for the long run.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4061026,101850,2017-04-07T09:51:17-04:00,Incoming bids for Toshiba's memory asset has been underwhelming.Additional hurdles to rule out Chinese bidders.Lower bid price likely to materialize - accretive for Western Digital.,"While that may certainly apply for Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) with the latest newsflow out of Yokkaichi, it definitely isn't the case for Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). The incoming bids have been underwhelming considering Toshiba President Satoshi Tsunakawa's 2T yen asking price with some bids below ¥1.5T.As things stand, signs are pointing to a higher probability of a WDC bid winning out although no signs yet of joint financial backing (e.g. through PE funding).Within the tech community, Toshiba's memory sale is huge - with $18 billion in sales, Toshiba is the world's second-largest memory chip manufacturer by market share behind only Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF).The bids so farFrom Toshiba's perspective, the bid values have been underwhelming. While the latest bid from Silver Lake/Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) was at the higher end of the valuation range, valuations fell far short of Toshiba's asking price. The Nikkei Asian Review noted some bids even came below 1.5 trillion yen (~$13.5B), mainly from private equity.Thus far, bids submitted include - 1) SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) with a Japanese financial institutions for 10 trillion won (~$9B) for 50% of Toshiba memory, implying ~$18B valuation; 2) Silver Lake/Broadcom bid with a ~$18B valuation; and 3) higher-end bids of >2 trillion yen (~$18B) according to Toshiba President Satoshi Tsunakawa.The Silver Lake/Broadcom offerBoth parties recently tendered a ~2 trillion yen ($17.9 trillion) bid. Relative to the other bidders, that would put it on the high end of estimates of the memory business' value.For some perspective, Silver Lake was the lead VC firm that took Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), WDC's main competitor, private in a March 2000 take-out deal for $19 billion. Considering the relationship Silver Lake has with Seagate, a Silver Lake acquisition does not bode well for WDC. Why? It could allow a back door entry of Seagate into the direct manufacture of NAND flash chips or access to cheaper flash chips.Their key motive though, is probably to unlock synergies with Dell, another of its investment holdings.What about Broadcom? One possibility is that Broadcom is after chips for commercial telecommunications equipment. On the whole, Broadcom is unlikely to take a controlling interest in the asset and start running NAND fabs. Instead, they might look to integrate a small asset within Toshiba Semiconductors and take a passive minority stake in the asset (off P&L).While WDC maintains a stronger case for the Toshiba asset, one positive takeaway for WDC is that both Dell and Broadcom intend to use the Toshiba acquisition to provide chips for internal consumption [vs. Micron (NASDAQ:MU)/SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) (OTC:HXSCL), who would likely be in direct competition in the NAND space].The case for Micron and HynixAn acquisition by Micron would allow it to gain significant market share, especially in the mobile MCP (multi-chip packages) market.Meanwhile, acquiring the Toshiba asset would catalyze SK Hynix's ramp of 3D chip technology and grow its share of the NAND market. Additionally, the fact that both Toshiba and SK Hynix manufacture 3D NAND with a similar BiCS architecture makes the asset even more appealing to Hynix. From an industry perspective, this would be advantageous as consolidation occurs and brings about a more stable pricing dynamic though WDC would likely face share pressure from Hynix's ramp.Sovereign hurdle rules out Chinese biddersThe deal could face security issues on two fronts - 1) Toshiba memory chips are used in solid state drives that store classified information involving military and diplomatic secrets and 2) The Japanese government will want to avoid loss of technology to non-allies such as China, ensuring the vitality of Toshiba's chip operations in Japan. Issues such as leak prevention and protecting jobs will thus, be at the forefront of negotiations along with valuations.On the latter point, it is widely believed that Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry would prefer an American buyer given the security alliance between the countries. This effectively rules out the Chinese bidders such as Foxconn (OTC:FXCOF).Western Digital remains on pole, further upside aheadWhat does all this mean for WDC? Considering the underwhelming bids and restrictions on bidding, Western Digital remains in the pole position to win Toshiba's NAND assets. But here's the key - higher accretion is now more likely since a lower acquisition price is now more likely to materialize.With the latest developments in mind, the ceiling is now closer to ¥2T than the ¥2.5T anticipated previously which means WDC will be able to cap the debt load well below the ~$12B paid for Sandisk.Key caveat - the NAND supply/ demand dynamics will not last forever and could turn around as soon as 2018. If that happens, we could see some price volatility before the industry settles into longer term consolidation.Overall, WDC's prospects continue to look good and I'd stay long in 2017 on 1) realization of synergies from Sandisk and Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, 2) favorable capital allocation, 3) leadership in enterprise drives, and 4) longer term transformation into a media agnostic storage provider.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4049872,24419,2017-02-27T07:45:06-05:00,"Western Digital's margins will continue to expand over the next several years based on synergy execution and tight supply of HDD and NAND flash.Data center data storage is growing at 40% per year, a strong secular growth trend with no signs of abating.Western Digital is no longer a PC business. PC exposure within the hard drive business is down to 23% versus 50% in FY2013.Strong FCF generation will allow for de-leveraging and returning capital to shareholders over time.","Company DescriptionWestern Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is a digital storage company with a product suite that includes hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), NAND flash memory, hybrid storage products and systems, and storage-enabling software. In its current form, WDC is the amalgamation of three major companies that have combined over time - the legacy Western Digital business (HDDs), Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, or HGST (HDDs, acquired in 2012), and SanDisk (SSDs and NAND flash, acquired in 2016). WDC is the only digital storage company with fully integrated HDD, SSD, and NAND flash capabilities. The HDD industry is a near-duopoly. WDC and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) each have +/- ~45% market share, with Toshiba (TSSBY) accounting for the remainder. In NAND, WDC/SanDisk controls ~40% of wafer capacity.Variant PerceptionWDC's margins will continue to expand over the next several years, faster than the market is projecting, as the company extracts synergies from HGST and SanDisk and storage supply (HDDs and NAND flash memory) remains constrained relative to demand growth. The market's skepticism over WDC's top line growth model of 4-8%/year will prove unwarranted, with data center data demand growing ~40% year and strong end market opportunities across its product suite. This will result in valuation re-rating on top of earnings growth.Summary DiscussionWDC has done an excellent job locking in its long-term relevance as a digital storage company by bulking up its SSD and NAND capabilities via acquisitions, the largest of which was SanDisk. The combination of HDDs with SSD capabilities and locked-in NAND flash supply gives WDC a unique market position. Growth will be driven by data center storage demand growth, a secular trend which is estimated to be increasing at +40% per year.Synergies from both SanDisk and its 2012 HGST acquisition will continue to generate margin expansion over the coming years. WDC expects ~$800 million of synergies from HGST by the end of CY2017 and over $500 million from SanDisk by the end of CY2017, with over $1 billion by CY2020. Incremental synergies expected by the end of CY2017 of $665 million represent ~20% of op ex. While some of this will be re-invested in the business and the cash benefit in the near-term is soaked up by the cost of delivering the synergies, it sets up the company for more efficient performance over time.While WDC stock has had a strong move since its lows last year, it is still inexpensive (~9x earnings, ~5.5x EV/EBITDA, FCF yield of ~ 10%). The market does not fully appreciate the earnings and cash flow power of the combined WDC/SanDisk entity.WDC has been mentioned as a potential buyer of a majority stake in Toshiba's flash business. Through SanDisk, WDC is already a JV partner with Toshiba, which has had a relationship with SanDisk for 17 years. The JV is key to WDC's NAND flash manufacturing strategy. Toshiba is having issues in other parts of its business and is reportedly looking to raise $8.8 billion, but is selling a majority stake in its flash memory chip business.Seagate also appears inexpensive and could be an interesting investment. It pays a more generous dividend than WDC (current dividend yield of ~5%). Seagate is committed to returning 30-50% of FCF to shareholders via dividend and share repurchases. While the company is also interesting, WDC's product breadth post the acquisition of SanDisk, its synergy opportunities, and its current valuation make it more interesting today than Seagate.DetailsThe HDD industry has consolidated significant over the past several decades, and is now essentially a duopoly. Both WDC and Seagate have ~45% market share each, with Toshiba accounting for the remaining ~10%. Purchasers of storage want to dual-source, which should keep market shares relatively steady, and even between WDC and STX.Source: SEC filingsWith consolidation comes more stable pricing, and since 2012, when the industry went from five players to the current two, plus gross margins have expanded and remained stable, FCF generation has been strong, with both WDC and STX initiating dividends and buying back significant shares (WDC stopped its repurchases after announcing the SanDisk acquisition).Source: SEC filingsSource: SEC filingsIn 2011, there were massive floods in Thailand, where both WDC and STX have manufacturing facilities. Both were impacted, with WDC more materially affected than STX. This limited supply and helped pricing and margins as OEM PC manufacturers looked to lock in guaranteed supply. In the same period, Seagate announced the acquisition of Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) HDD business, while WDC acquired Hitachi's HDD business. While capacity was constrained from the floods, the industry consolidated, resulting in a much more stable industry.Hitachi Global Storage TechnologiesHGST was formed in 2003 as the combination of IBM Corp.'s (NYSE:IBM) hard drive business and Hitachi's, with Hitachi paying IBM $2.05 billion for its HDD business deal. WDC announced on 3/7/2011 a cash and stock transaction valued at ~$4.3 billion. WDC acquired HGST for $3.5 billion in cash and 25 million shares of WDC valued at $750 million (based on WDC's closing price of $30.031 as of 3/4/2011). Hitachi will own ~10% of WDC after the deal closes, and two representatives of Hitachi will be added to the WDC board of directors. WDC's current CEO Steve Milligan was president and CEO of HGST at the time of the deal.SanDisk 2016Announced on 10/21/2015, the SanDisk acquisition closed on 5/12/2016. Each SanDisk share was converted into $67.50 in cash and 0.2387 shares of WDC. The aggregate purchase price was $15.588 billion - $13.77 billion in cash, and 49 million newly issued shares of WDC was a fair value of $1.76 billion and $58 million related to stock options and RSUs assumed. The purchase price equates to ~10.5 x EV/EBITDA and ~47x earnings (excluding synergies).UnisplendorWDC and Unisplendor Corporation Limited (an IT products and solutions company in China) entered into a JV to facilitate storage sales in China. The JV, announced in November 2015 and launched on 9/9/2016, is owned 51% by Unisplendor and 49% by WDC. UNIS WDC will market and sell Western Digital's datacenter storage systems, including its HGST Active Archive system, in China. The JV company will also invest in the development of new products and enhancements to Western Digital's products to create innovative solutions that address the evolving needs of the Big Data market in China. UNIS WDC will maintain corporate headquarters and R&D operations in Nanjing and a sales and marketing office in Beijing.Unisplendor had entered into a deal to acquire a 15% ownership stake in WDC for ~$3.8 billion in September 2015 at a 30% premium to WDC stock price at the time. Ultimately, concern by U.S. authorities over the investment on national security grounds led WDC and Unisplendor to terminate the deal, which had the knock-on impact of changing the terms of WDC's deal with SanDisk.Segments (from the company's December quarter earnings release)Source: SEC filings and my projectionsInvestment Thesis DetailKey Risks and Considerations DetailCapital Return (Dividends and Share Repurchase)The company instituted a dividend in September 2012 The current dividend yield of 2.7% is better than the market, but WDC will likely not increase the dividend, and instead, will focus on de-leveraging and potential further acquisitions. It is also more likely to resume share repurchases than dramatically increasing the dividend. Share repurchases were suspended on 10/21/15 when the SanDisk deal was announced.Total addressable marketPost the SanDisk acquisition, this should be changed given HDD TAM should no longer be as relevant to overall company performance.Management Remuneration Summary(Source: WDC Proxy Statement)Management BiographiesStephen D.

4045751,102615,2017-02-14T10:38:13-05:00,WDC's earnings per share (TTM) are currently less than its dividend per share (TTM).The company's most recent financial reports are showing a quick turnaround after the synergy.The company is becoming more effective and efficient with its operations after taking over SanDisk.,"As of now, Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:WDC) has had a consistent decline in revenue and EPS growth. However, the company just recently acquired SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) as a synergy that could help improve its current standing amongst competitors. Currently, WDC has reported weak numbers regarding its financial and growth metrics. Even worse is the constant decline in EPS growth and revenue that has been going on for roughly five years. One question to ask is if the latest performance could tie to acquiring SNDK? If so, can it jump through its current hurdles to gain traction on its ability to produce net profits for the year of 2017?It is safe to say that the takeover of SNDK by WDC was so that it can supply its consumers with more data storage capabilities throughout all its current and future products. The synergies between the two companies are relevant in the fact they both provided services and products to the data storage industry. WDC looks to increase its product line and continue to align itself with current technology standards so that it can compete better. Its numbers for the last quarter of 2016 provided weak sentiment across the board. Whether the performance is likely due to the takeover of SNDK or if it is more of an underlying issue that has been percolating for a while. To get a better insight on whether WDC is having growing pains or is becoming distressed, it is best to look at the trailing data to see how it has been doing in time.Dividend SetbackJust recently, its dividend yields were one of the highest out there. Now, it has completely turned upside down in which the company's dividend per share is greater than its current EPS, which will make it more difficult for the company to pay its dividends to its shareholders. The dividend per share is currently at $2.00 while the EPS is at -1.77. If the company wants to continue to pay out its current dividend payments, it will have to through other sources besides earnings. Since 2015, the company's EPS TTM has been in a sharp decline from being $7 in 2015 to now -1.77 for the present being. Its payout ratio is close to a one-year low at .63. It seems to me that the company is already preparing for a potential dividend cut and a continued decrease in the payout ratio to offset its current dividend predicament. At the same time, the company has a three-year dividend growth of 26%, which increased from $1.00 to $2.00, roughly in a span of three years. It is happening while the dividend yield is now near the one-year low. However, many companies have been in the same position and have been able to evade any potential trouble. I believe the company can make a quick comeback so that its earnings can pay for its current dividend payouts.Showing Signs of a ComebackBy looking at the financial statements, we can see that upon acquiring SNDK, WDC had a momentary lapse in some performance metrics such as Net Income, ROA, ROE, ROIC, and others. The second and third quarters of 2016 set WDC back, and even put them in the red on the company's bottom line. The last quarter of 2016 already started to show the blooming effect of the synergies between WDC and SNDK. Its net income is back to being positive as well as the other metrics mentioned earlier. The ROA went from -4.73 to 3.24, while the ROE went from -13.36 to 8.74 in just one quarter.What's more interesting is the operations of WDC. By looking through the financial statements, I was able to find that its gross and operating margins have increased providing positive sentiment that its operations are becoming more effective and efficient. It is still unknown whether the company will direct those savings from operations to its consumers, or use its savings to continue to build positive momentum for the business. So far, the synergy between the two companies is working well and has even increased its net margin from -7.76 to 4.81 for the last reported quarter. Another interesting point is that the gross profit margin has been increasing, showing that the company's cost of goods sold is making less of an impact on its earnings. Additionally, the cost of goods sold has bounced from a pullback at the beginning of 2016.WDC Gross Profit Margin (TTM) data by YChartsOne downside that the firm has acquired is the interest expense on buying SNDK. Investors are aware that the company used substantial financed debt to purchase the company thus increasing the interest expense per quarter. It directly affected its interest coverage ratio, which brought it down to less than 1, showing that WDC currently cannot afford to pay its current interest payments fully with current generating revenue levels. The current interest expense is -$681 million while the interest income is only $75 million. Alternatively, the interest coverage ratio on WDC is 2.66, which shows that the company can currently pay its interest payments on outstanding debt even after the takeover of SNDK. The return on invested capital is currently at 8.34% while its weighted average cost of capital is at 8.91%, which still shows that it must increase its returns on invested capital so that it begins to show a profit over its cost of capital, which will be a huge benefit for its shareholders. I believe that we will see the ROIC continue to increase just as other return metrics saw in the last quarter.The free cash flow for WDC began to decline from 2013 temporarily. However, when looking at free cash flow, especially of a company that just acquired SNDK, it could have very volatile numbers in shorter time frames. When looking at a 10-year range, we can see that WDC's free cash flow has been increasing and holding steady in the long term. Before acquiring SNDK, the company had no debt. So the only debt incurred as the majority is based on the takeover of the enterprise. If the synergy continues to prove amicable, then the financed debt to take over SNDK was worthwhile. With a quick comeback from WDC in regards to its financials, I can assume that if the positive progression persists throughout 2017, WDC can look to bring in new investor interest into the stock better. I believe that WDC will continue to show investors healthy growth after the synergy and will be able to withstand the dividend issue in a short amount of time until its earnings per share show positive returns.Finishing UpI see a great entry opportunity to go long with adamant support levels as stops. The entry price would be $79.66 just above the previous sell candle on the weekly chart. The stop could either be $74.83 or $65.43, which are both levels on the Fibonacci retracement and extension. I placed both types of Fibonacci levels so that I can potentially find price levels that may overlap one another between both Fibonaccis. The reasoning behind this is that having overlapping factors creates a ""heavier"" support level. However, there is a resistance level with the same overlapping features priced at $84.24, which is the .618 Fibonacci level. Once the price can break through that level and preferably close above, it could allow the stock to push much higher price levels from $88 to $92.A majority of analysts currently have a buy rating on the stock, and this has increased with a positive sentiment for the last three reporting quarters. Analysts have priced its targets with an average of $92.31. My targets are more than reasonable as it is a bit below their expectations. With the closer stops, the risk/reward ratio would be around two times the initial risk. Most people are not used to tight stops, which is how I like to trade. If the wider stop fits and investors preference, then targets should be raised to offset the risk/reward ratio to ideal levels. Next earnings report on WDC is on April 26th after the market close. Make sure to continue to actively follow for new information as the synergy continues to settle."
4058316,21702,2017-03-27T21:12:03-04:00,"Micron's EPS report last week was a bullish shot in the arm.Costs savings as a result of the HGST and SanDisk acquisitions appear to be on track to save an estimated $1.3 billion annually.Meantime, the company has successfully repriced a significant portion of its debt load.WDC could earn $9.25/share in 2018 (w/o an increasing stake in Toshiba J/V). Put a P/E=12 on that and you get $111/share.","Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) has been riding a wave of good news recently, yet the stock still looks undervalued. The most bullish catalyst was Micron Technology's (NASDAQ:MU) Q2 EPS report released last week and perhaps even more importantly - Micron's guidance going forward:Q3 2017 projections:Micron Technology CEO Mark Durcan highlighted strong demand and limited supply for NAND. That matches up well with WDC's opinion that NAND flash will remain on allocation for the remainder of calendar-year 2017.All that said, WDC's stock reaction was somewhat muted as compared to Micron's:And while that may seem rational considering WDC has a large and lower-margin HD business as compared to Micron, which has a very healthy DRAM business, investors may be overlooking other positive catalysts.And that could be because the press is full of stories about the potential outcome of Toshiba's (OTCPK:TOSBF) memory and technology asset sale. Concerns are that - following so closely on the heels of the SanDisk acquisition - WDC's balance sheet could be compromised. Yet in one of the better articles on this subject - published right here on Seeking Alpha by contributor JP Research (see: Buy WDC Ahead of Toshiba Acquisition) - it would appear the path forward may not be as steep a hill to climb as many believe. I agree with JP Research in that the potential for private equity to engage in partnership with WDC is very likely. That could substantially reduce additional stress on WDC's balance sheet, while at the same time protecting WDC's existing investment in the Toshiba JV. In addition, note that any increase in WDC's ownership level would be accretive to earnings.Meantime, there are some additional catalysts going forward for WDC. The graphic below shows the company's recent acquisitions:Source: Investor Day PresentationOf course, the two biggest buys - HGST and SanDisk - are both currently being fully integrated into WDC. In aggregate, WDC expects to see an estimated $1.3 billion in overall costs savings and is still on track to deliver (listen to President & COO Mike Cordano's Morgan Stanley webcast here).And while not too exciting, note that WDC has been successful in reducing borrowing costs with two recent actions:That may not seem like a lot, but ending 2016 with 294 million shares means the $42 million in interest savings equates to an additional $0.14/share. While that pales in comparison to the estimated $1.3 billion in HGST/SanDisk synergy savings (~$4.42/share), it's always good to see a company stay on top of its financing costs. Note also that WDC ended 2016 with $4.94 billion in cash.Meantime, on the technology front, WDC continues to march forward with the recent release of the world's first 512 GB 64-layer 3D NAND chip. Mass production is expected in the 2H of 2017 and WDC says it expects 40% of wafer starts this year to be 64-layer 3D technology.In the consumer space, I recently bought one of the SanDisk 16 GB ""Cruzer Blade"" USB flash drives. This device is shown below and cost an amazing $6.49. No wonder demand is out of sight for NAND. And what I really like about this device - in addition to the low price - is that it comes with an embedded security application that prompts for a password. This means you can leave it on your desktop and not worry if someone pockets it - they'll never get into it (assuming your password creation skills are adequate). Very cool.SanDisk's 16 GB ""Cruzer Blade"" USB Flash DriveSummary & ConclusionI think the concern over WDC's balance sheet with respect to any potential expansion of its stake in the Toshiba JV (which I do expect) is overblown. Considering the tailwinds in the white hot NAND flash market, and the company's continued execution on the integration of the two big acquisitions, I think WDC could earn $8 this year and $9.25 next year. Slap a P/E=12 on that, and you get a 12-month PT of $111. The primary risk is a stumble on the 3D NAND technology rollout. But note the company is not converting entire fabs over to 3D all at once, they are going line by line and mitigating exposure during the transition. That said, investors do need to stay tuned for technology headline risks.Meantime, any deal on the Toshiba front I believe will be well thought out, accretive, and a net positive catalyst for WDC, not a negative as the market appears to be pricing into the stock."
4040134,21702,2017-01-27T10:24:33-05:00,"WDC took on loads of debt to finance the SanDisk acquisition. The stock sold off big time.Yet NAND flash was a strategic must-have in the storage business.Q2 2017's results proved it, and management is executing on its promises with respect to integration of HGST.WDC is a long-term buy-n-hold technology company to hold in your 401k or IRA retirement plan - for capital appreciation and surprisingly decent income too.","I few years back the decision I faced was either Western Digital (NYSE:WDC) or SanDisk. I liked both very much. WDC appeared to offer better value so I went with it. But of course that was the wrong decision and in hindsight SanDisk was ultimately the better stock pick. But obviously I own both now.My interest in Western Digital began in 2013 when I made note of the huge opportunity the company had to provide solutions for storing the massive amounts of data the U.S. government was apparently collecting (mind you, not that I agreed that the government should be collecting such data in the first place). See: Western Digital: I Spy An Opportunity. As security concerns seem to keep increasing around the planet, I continue to believe that investment thesis is still highly relevant. But not the biggest by any means. More on that later.I also wrote a prior article on Western Digital and pounded the table on management's commitment to return 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. After that article, WDC management re-directed FCF instead to buy SanDisk last year. That happened so after WDC won the right to integrate all of HGST after receiving approval from China's Ministry of Commerce (""MOFCOM"") in 2015.What happened next was oodles of debt issuance (and yet more debt). At the end of 2016, the company had over $13.2 billion in debt at an average rate of 5.85%:Source: WDC Q2 2017 Quarterly Fact SheetInvestors ran for the hills, and the stock took a shellacking - dropping from over $110 under $40 in less than 18 months. Skepticism (and perhaps fear) ran rampant:Those who did not understand the strategic nature of the SanDisk acquisition likely got nervous and bailed. And of course the company had to show excellent growth and financial results in order to rationalize the large debt obligations related to the SanDisk deal. That's exactly what Western did yesterday when it delivered its fiscal Q2 2017 EPS report to investors:Yoy revenue was up nearly 50% while FCF nearly doubled and headcount declined by 4,000 employees - proving the efficiencies management discussed with respect to the HGST integration were not a fantasy. Note that while total HDD shipments were down 10%, total exabytes of memory shipped were up 12.6%: indications that the size of HDD drives are larger and that NAND flash memory was a nice healthy chunk of shipments.The company generated $1.1 billion in CFO during the quarter, ending with ~$5.2 billion of cash.Why WDC Is A Long-term Buy-n-Hold CompanyIt's simple: WDC provides high density storage solutions for large and small consumers that will continually demand more and more capacity to store their 1s and 0s as a result of an increasingly digital based planet. In addition, the need to have those 1s and 0s travel with us in our pockets means the NAND flash business is going to keep growing for many decades to come. In addition, the home entertainment arena - streaming to storage to watch on a large screen - is firmly in place and there will likely be some excellent and very easy-to-use home entertainment devices coming our way. On this account, note that those who over-emphasized ""cable cutting"" may have been missing something: note that Comcast (NASDAQ:CMCSA) crushed earnings and announced a 2:1 split yesterday on the heels of excellent subscriber additions. Chairman and CEO Brian Roberts said:I suspect there is one or more WDC HDDs and/or NAND memory system(s) in each home or business on the end of those cable lines.Update, 11.54 A.M.Taking a look at the quarterly conference call transcript, WDC demonstrated strength across the board:Bottom line, WDC is now a full-service storage solutions provider from top-to-bottom, and the long-term growth prospects are excellent.Summary and ConclusionYes WDC took on lots of debt, but the strategic nature of its SanDisk acquisition was pretty much a strategic ""must-have"" move by the company to become a full service memory provider - across the demand spectrum - going forward. Now it is like Usain Bolt in the starting blocks, poised for a fast growth sprint (for the next couple years). Longer term, WDC is just one stock you want to buy-n-hold in your retirement account and just watch go higher on a nice steady growth incline. The only development that would likely change my opinion in the short term would be if President Trump makes a huge blunder with respect to trade with China. Hopefully, his economics team is consulting with those in Silicon Valley to make sure both they - and more importantly President Trump - are aware of the realities of the global electronics supply chain and the importance of logistics planning within that supply chain. Oh, and the other thing to watch is any potential hiccup on the NAND technology roadmap, which I don't expect.Meantime, WDC is back on its prior growth trajectory (and likely a steeper one) and is executing very well. The analysts are back to the party and falling all over themselves upgrading the stock with price targets generally in the range of $100/share. I happen to agree with these analysts projections and think the stock could easily reach and exceed $100 after the next couple earnings reports. That is, there is much farther to go even after the 10% rise in the shares over the last few days (see below). As for the FCF I mentioned in my earlier article on Western Digital, the dividend was raised to $2 a year and the company now yields a perhaps surprising 2.6%."
4054419,62493,2017-03-12T22:55:45-04:00,"The Toshiba sale of its JV interest with WDC has huge consequences for the industry.Many bidders are involved and the outcome is hard to predict.Nevertheless, Japan, Inc. and Western Digital will determine the winner or winners.","About the time of the Western Digital (NYSE:WDC) acquisition of SanDisk in May of 2015, the NAND industry as a whole joined the 3D process competition with Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). Since then, all the companies have been deep in the throes of this most challenging conversion from planar to 3D die production. As we have documented in numerous other articles, this effort has been marked by significant difficulties that, all combined, have reduced yields to such an extent that the conversion to date has resulted in higher cost per bit than the planar process that was replaced. For all the entities producing NAND - save one - only now, with the advent of the 64-layer die is the density advantage of 3D showing strong promise of overwhelming the relatively poorer yields of the new process.If these were normal times, this density achievement - 64 layers - could be counted on to greatly increase the supply of bits coming to market by next year at the latest. Once again, with the exception of one entity, customers are being disappointed. Industry productivity is still low due to a condition that could be called planar overhang - that being the amount of planar capacity that must be converted as fast as possible to 3D, so the company can take advantage of the denser 3D process. Unfortunately, this conversion process from planar to 3D is basically like buying a house that has to be completely renovated and then finding out that load-bearing walls are involved - and the foundation has to be reinforced. The net of this conversion is a loss of bit output for up to a year as planar production is torn down before the new etch-intensive 3D process can be begun. How big is the planar overhang? According to Ernie Maddock of Micron (NASDAQ:MU), almost 70% of the wafer output of the industry is still planar. (Bit output of 3D by the industry as a whole should reach crossover with planar by the end of this year.)So here we are, just ending the first calendar quarter of 2017, and bit output growth from the industry is estimated to be at historic lows - at 40% CAGR and maybe below. (Indeed, Samsung is projecting only 30% bit growth this calendar year.) Demand, on the other hand, is as strong as it has been in years at 45% (plus or minus a few points depending on who you talk to) and is showing no signs of abating. Inventories across the industry are low, prices are high - up 6-10% - and customers are scrambling to find product.The result of all this commotion is that customers are crying, but the industry oligarchs are a happy lot despite their productivity difficulties. This is especially true for the IM partners, Micron and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), the one shining exception to this otherwise dismal picture of industry productivity. Micron's projection is that its YoY NAND bit increase will top 60%, and Intel's projected bit increase is even stronger at an estimated 100%. Planar overhang? Not for the IM partners. They are practically done with the conversions. Yield problems? Nope. They are getting ""mature"" yields equivalent to their planar process - something not even the mighty Samsung boasts of. The net result of all this is a large bit share increase for Intel and especially for Micron as it claws its way back from years of underperformance and share losses in NAND. Even better for the IM duo, they will have a roughly 12% density advantage at the 64L node, touting the industry's smallest 3D die at 59mm2.The net of all this is what we might call the IM trifecta. To wit:Boil all this down and we are facing the opportunity for a truly tectonic shift in the industry. Interesting times, no? And we haven't even touched on the most interesting aspect of the current period, and that is the prospect of even stronger NAND demand over the balance of the decade - a topic I addressed in my last article. Focusing solely on Micron now, there's only one little problem with all of this wonderful news, and that is that it doesn't have the money to truly take advantage of its competitive strength. Micron needs the ability to fund more capacity - more wafer growth. If it can't build more fabs, the company will find that its current bit share gains dissipate in 2019 and 2020. Here's a graphic description of that phenomenon showing a scenario where the industry only adds the capacity that is currently planned (5 new fabs, counting Fab 10N and Intel's Dalian Fab) and finishes converting all its planar capacity to 3D by 2019.And here is the total industry production and demand scenario in tabular form:There are several important takeaways from the graphic above. Here are the most important of them. The first is that the industry has the capacity to meet the needs of customers through 2020 if demand increases at Micron's forecast 45% CAGR rate and the industry maintains capacity discipline by building out only the five new fabs announced or in progress. (Please note that the driving assumption behind this growth scenario is that the industry solves the 64-layer limit they face through either string stacking or improved etching tools by 2019.) The second major finding is that Toshiba's (OTCPK:TOSBF) and WDC's strong share gains are a direct function of the building of a gigantic new fab coming online in mid-to-late 2019, allowing them to match Samsung's new wafer additions during this period.There is one other vital piece of information to keep in mind. This new Toshiba/WDC fab has a proposed budget of $7.8B. According to the Anandtech article:This picture, from a WDC presentation at its recent Investors Day, will give you a notion of the scale, estimated to be 500k sq. ft.The strategic question that leaps from this information is this: would Toshiba/WDC commit to such a large investment if A: they didn't believe that demand would stay at least at the 45% CAGR level, and B: they didn't believe that they could fix the BiCS density and yield issues? So now to the most interesting question of all.Will this fab get built?That is the question that arises out of the recent news that Toshiba has decided to sell its 50% stake in the Flash Ventures JV with Western Digital.The facts as we know are the following:From news reports including Barons Asia, and (thanks to H. Bruce Campbell) ITPro from Nikkei Business Publishing, we know that there are numerous bidders, including WDC, Micron, SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF), and Hon Hai Precision Manufacturing (OTCPK:HNHAF) (Foxconn (OTC:FXCOF)), Bain Capital, Canon (NYSE:CAJ), and many others that we probably haven't heard about.Here's a news item from the NY Times, dated Jan. 27th.Sorting through the clutter, what we're seeing in the bidders' list is the following:Unmentioned but (thanks again to HBC!) on everyone's lips is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Mentioned but not in serious contention due to serious national security issues is China, Inc. Who is going to win this deal? What follows is an assessment of the factors from each entity's point of view with particular focus on Micron (and by association IM).Let's consider the current operating environment because this will have a big impact on the eventual choice of a winner. Yokkaichi is a joint venture of WDC and Toshiba. The partnership, originally between SanDisk and Toshiba, was initially formed in 2000. Last year, WDC and Toshiba formed Flash Ventures, a vehicle that rolls up other JV agreements signed over the years to finance and run the four fabs that have been built so far. The two partners share R&D, CapEx, and operating expenses of the 4 fabs equally. The 3D process that they have chosen, BiCS, is a charge-trap architecture. In this regard, it is similar though not identical with Samsung's V-NAND and almost identical to SK Hynix's 3D NAND product (primarily because SK Hynix stole the IP from Toshiba).Although we do not know for sure (the Partners haven't published their JV agreement), it is quite likely that the Partners have some say in who acquires the other partner's share and they almost certainly have a right of first refusal. I am speculating here but I would be amazed if either party would countenance an agreement that did not include this. If this is true, WDC, whether or not it wins the bid, will have considerable power to shape the final deal.Here are the assets in play:The total wafers of capacity in these fabs in the period before the 3D conversions began was nearly 500k wpm, with Toshiba claiming rights to roughly 30k wpm more than WDC because of the sale by SanDisk to Toshiba of 30% of the capacity of Fab 3 in 2008, leaving Toshiba with about 270k wpm capacity to WDC's 230k wpm.Now that we know what is in play, let's handicap this deal from each bidder's perspective, starting with Western Digital. For WDC, the options are stark, with the positives being extremely compelling while the negatives of another supplier winning the deal are quite punitive. Consider for a moment an example of the negatives. Let's say Micron (or another competitor) bids and wins. Micron obviously is not interested in the BiCS process, so the company would convert Toshiba's share of the site to IM's 3D NAND. Doing this deprives WDC of its R&D partner, and at a stroke doubles WDC's NAND R&D expense. Beyond that, WDC suddenly has a competitor that, having acquired Toshiba's staff as well as its equipment, knows exactly how productive the BiCS process is. Micron would know Toshiba's yields and thus know its costs. In the notoriously secretive memory industry, this information is jealously guarded because of the competitive advantage to be gained. This would be intolerable for WDC, unless of course IM agreed to share and license its 3D NAND IP to WDC. Why would the IM partners do that?Beyond that, why would Micron agree to fund its presumptive half of the new mega-fab? Micron would not want to share the new fab for all the reasons listed above. From WDC's perspective, it is now left needing to plan a new, presumably smaller fab, and because of the delay caused by the acquisition, this new WDC-only fab could be considerably delayed. In addition to the delay, WDC's risk in bearing the CapEx cost alone would grow considerably. This in itself is not a deal killer issue, but in combination with all the other negatives we can easily see why WDC would never willingly countenance a Micron winning bid.On the other hand, if WDC wins the bid, beyond the formidable financial commitment (presumably only done with Japan, Inc. partners) it now can move forward with the same staff it has been partnering with (it would simply transfer the Toshiba personnel) and it has now more than doubled its NAND output. How would the deal be structured? Could it be managed as an all-debt transaction? Remember that the bid price - something above $14B, would need to generate an additional $8B in free cash flow to fund the new mega-fab, if WDC decided to move forward with it. And don't forget that WDC is already bearing $13B in debt from the SanDisk acquisition.Considering another competitor who would love to win this deal, an S.K. Hynix winning bid might be more palatable to WDC. Compared to Micron, one thing that is notably different about the Hynix bid would be what we might call process affinity. Given the identical antecedents of the two companies 3D process, might it be possible that Hynix would simply adopt the Toshiba BiCS process company-wide? On the positive side, alone or in combination with Foxconn, an S.K. Hynix win would provide WDC with a deep-pocketed partner who would have little issue with funding Fab 6.Looking at the negatives from a WDC (and Japanese) perspective, however, one inevitably bumps up against the question of enabling a competitor, especially a Korean competitor. Why would WDC want that? Beyond that question, there is the very real issue of geo-political risk. If anything happens on the Korean peninsula, WDC could be left with a crippled partner potentially unable to fund its half of the JV. Considering for a moment the Foxconn combination with Hynix, I find it hard to believe that Japan, Inc. would sanction a deal with a bidder with such close ties to China. Whatever assurances Terry Gou might give, the risk of a potential IP transfer to China, Inc. would be intolerable.Bottom line, I find it difficult to believe that a bid from the Korean company would be contemplated. A Foxconn win is even less likely. Let's move on.Let's consider the customer/vendor category. There are any number of Japan, Inc. potentials including Canon and Tokyo Electron (OTCPK:TOELF). Would they be attractive to WDC? Probably, because almost any customer that bought the Toshiba half would not want to operate the fab. Like the IM partners, where Micron runs the fab using jointly developed IP, presumably WDC would operate the Fab and provide the ""silent"" partner rights to half of the die coming out of the Fab. In Canon's case, would it even do that? Possibly it would want to simply take a split off the gross profit of the product sold by WDC sales and marketing resources? Quite possibly, using a template employed many times before, Japan, Inc. would limit its involvement to sponsoring the financing of WDC buyout at very attractive terms. Could one possibility be some Japan, Inc. funding entity (consortium, state funds, etc.) that could provide attractive financing to WDC of some share of Toshiba's interest while also funding Toshiba sufficiently to allow the company to retain some amount of the business?What about non-Japanese customers? Let's consider the case of Apple, which presumably wouldn't want to bid on the full Toshiba share because it wouldn't want to pollute its industry-leading gross margins with the lower margins that ""Apple Memories"" would be generating. On the other hand, if Apple participated with other entities in a consortium where it provided less than 20% of the equity, it could keep the memory division's results off its books. If this is the approach that Apple takes, who would be likely partners? In my view, this is where Japan, Inc. would provide the most value. Imagine a WDC, Canon, Apple, and Japan Inc. loan consortium splitting the deal. Apple and Canon get access to product, and WDC gets to operate the fab independently. Would this combination pass anti-trust scrutiny? I don't know the answer to that, but taking some arbitrarily large portion of the new JV's production out of the merchant market seems to me to raise the question, especially if say, Apple's deal is at more favorable terms than those provided to other customers.If anti-trust concerns can be accommodated, such a combination makes a lot of sense to me because it solves so many problems. First, it allows WDC to keep competitors at arm's length. Second, it provides the financing that enables the silent partner assured access to memory product. Finally, it poses no risks to the IP being lost or stolen. All the partners' interests are aligned.There, of course, is one gigantic assumption that underlays Apple's involvement and that is that Apple is convinced that the BiCS technology is competitive with V-Nand and IM's 3D NAND processes.Is this the case? Whatever the density disadvantages of BiCS compared to IM's 3D CuA architecture, (about 12%), the real issue for BiCS is yield. How soon can they fix the yield problem? We do not have enough information to make a definitive call on this. Samsung uses a different charge trap die architecture and, according to sources I trust, is finally achieving competitive yields with its V-NAND product. So why couldn't WDC and its new partner accomplish the same? One thing for sure - the prospective purchaser of Toshiba's share will want to make a determination of this issue prior to closing the deal.Let's close this. My analysis leads me to handicap this deal as follows:There are only three possible winning bidders, with Japan, Inc. being the most likely, in some combination with WDC and a US or Japan-based customer (like Apple, Canon, etc). Toshiba may well be bailed out and allowed to retain some portion of the winning consortium's interest in the deal, most likely as an operator who might be offered terms that would eventually allow it to reclaim much of its former share.No competitor is going to win the deal unless there is no option left. Less likely but very tantalizing is the prospect that private capital - say Bain or the like - combines with WDC to enable WDC to buy out Toshiba's share. There is only one way this happens, and that is if the private capital bidder really buys into my exploding NAND demand hypothesis. If Bain really believes that NAND demand is going to outstrip the capability of the industry to build capacity, why wouldn't it fund the buyout of Toshiba? I think that it is quite likely that a private capital provider will make an aggressive bid, but in the end Japan, Inc. is not going to let this technology jewel get away from them.Finally, for those of you out there thinking Micron might somehow have a chance, there is only one circumstance that could enable such an outcome. Is it possible that WDC and Toshiba believe that their BiCS process is fatally flawed? If they do, then all bets are off, and they will do whatever they have to invite either of the IM partners to the party. Problem is, I don't believe they do. One has only to listen to Dr. Siva Sivaram from WDC at its recent Investors Day presentation. They may have a density and yield disadvantage now but Sivaram is clearly a man who thinks that BiCS process will be competitive over time.Clearly the industry is on the cusp of what is potentially a tectonic-scale change to the industry structure that could pose major challenges or offer significant benefits to incumbent firms depending on how it turns out. The IM partners, Micron and Intel, will probably not be a part of the eventual solution that emerges in Yokkaichi, but they will be watching the result with great interest. It is entirely possible that Fab 6 could be delayed while the new partner(s) and WDC establish a working relationship and come to agreement on their CapEx plans. Given the industry's need for capacity going forward if there is any material issue with the funding for Fab 6 that will be a bright green light for a least one of the other players to get started on a new Fab. Micron doesn't have the money to build it. Would Intel?Interesting times indeed!Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Western Digital's floundering HDDs business will continue to plummet, and SSDs are its imminent salvation.Other companies are also potential investors, but the one with the most viability is China's Tsinghua Unigroup.","Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY) disclosed that it will likely sell a roughly 20% interest in its semiconductor unit for between 200 billion yen and 300 billion yen ($1.77-2.65 billion), while retaining a majority stake and keeping the new company in group earnings. Its semiconductor unit is largely NAND flash memory production.One possible idea being floated as part of the spin-off plan is a partial sale to Western Digital Corp. (NYSE:WDC).As a backdrop to this article, Toshiba and Western Digital operate key flash memory plants together in the Mie Prefecture city of Yokkaichi. Memory chips accounted for the majority of the 1.57 trillion yen in sales of Toshiba's semiconductor operations in fiscal 2015.Toshiba invented both NOR and NAND memory, and first established the flash memory market in 1984. SanDisk had been a long-term partner of Toshiba since 2001, and the joint venture had provided SanDisk with stable NAND supply. The two companies collaborated in developing BiCS3, which they claim was ""the world's first 3D NAND technology with 64 layers,"" up from 48 layers in the previous BiCS2 tech. The technology is now in production, with commercial volumes of BiCS3 expected to become available by mid-2017.Western Digital in 2016 acquired SanDisk for $19 billion, assuming all contractual agreements between Toshiba and SanDisk.(Source: The Information Network)Besides inventing flash memory and introducing the first chip in 1984, 3D NAND was introduced by Toshiba in 2007. Toshiba manufactures NAND chips from a complex of fabs in Yokkaichi in Mie Prefecture in Japan (see photo below). Today, Toshiba and Western Digital produce 3D NAND flash in their recently opened New Fab 2. Also, the two companies have begun to convert Fab 5 to 3D NAND.Shown in Table 2 are Toshiba's NAND capacities by fab. The old Fab 2 building, which was the initial ""Flash Vision"" JV plant with SanDisk, ended its 200mm wafer production in 2010 and is replaced by the New Fab 2. Fab 3, the first 300mm megafab, was maxed out in Q1 2009 and continues to run at 150K WPM. In Q1 2009, Fab 4 was running at 160K WPM. By the middle of 2011, Fab 4 was maxed out at 200K WPM. Fab 5, Toshiba's 3rd 300 mm megafab was completed in 2011, and is currently being converted to 3D NAND.Western Digital and Toshiba currently operate these fabs under three business ventures in 300-millimeter NAND-flash manufacturing facilities in Yokkaichi, Japan, which provide leading-edge, cost-competitive NAND wafers for end products.In mid-July 2016, Toshiba and Western Digital opened the New Fab 2 in Yokkaichi, Japan. Construction of New Fab 2 had begun in September 2014.WDC is a 49.9% owner in Flash Ventures, the moniker for the three business ventures as well as the New Fab 2.In early November 2016, Toshiba finalized plans to build a new production facility to make 3D NAND. Construction is supposed to start in February 2017, completed in mid-2018, and high-volume production to be started in 2019. WDC intends to extend the joint venture partnership with Toshiba to the new wafer fab, but the proviso in the agreement in the Flash Ventures plan is there is no certainty as to when and on what terms WDC would participate with Toshiba in any investment in, or use of, the new wafer fab, if at all. This is noted in WDC's most recent 10-K.Shown in Table 3 are market shares of NAND flash suppliers from Q1 2010 through Q3 2016. There are numerous takeaways from this chart, but I wanted to focus on Toshiba and SanDisk/WD. Since WDC acquired SanDisk in Q2 2016, all data points prior to that quarter were SanDisk revenues. As a 49.9% owner in Flash Ventures, WDC is contractually obligated to purchase half of Flash Ventures' NAND wafer supply or pay for 50% of the fixed costs of Flash Ventures. A majority of its flash memory is currently supplied by Flash Ventures and, to a much lesser extent, by third-party silicon suppliers.The Flash Ventures obligation between Toshiba and Western Digital is the same as it was with SanDisk.Over the past 11 quarters, Toshiba's share averaged 20% more than SanDisk's share. Since SanDisk and now WDC are obligated to purchase 50% of output, I suspect Toshiba's 20% premium in share, which equates to a 20% premium in revenue, is based on profit margins on merchant sales to its customers.Who's going to take up Toshiba's offer?Below are my thoughts on the companies that may have an interest in Toshiba's plan.Western DigitalAccording to the latest 10-K from Western Digital:Currently, as a 49.9% owner in Flash Ventures, WDC is contractually obligated to purchase half of Flash Ventures' NAND wafer supply or pay for 50% of the fixed costs of Flash Ventures.WDC is dependent on Flash Ventures and other strategic relationships with Toshiba for its NAND flash memory supply, and therefore, its business, financial condition and operating results, and its ability to realize the anticipated benefits from the merger will be dependent on the success of Flash Ventures and other strategic relationships with Toshiba, according to the company.With the downturn in the HDD business, WDC must increase its investment in Toshiba in CAPEX spend for continued NAND supply, conversion of 2D to 3D NAND in the fabs, and the construction and equipment placement of the new NAND fab.To illustrate Western Digital's need outside its core HDD business, net revenue was $13.0 billion for 2016 - a decrease of 11% from the prior year, primarily due to lower HDD unit shipments. According to The Information Network's report ""The Hard Disk Drive (HDD) And Solid State Drive (SSD) Industries: Market Analysis And Processing Trends,"" total HDD shipments for 2016 decreased to 185 million units, compared to 229 million units in the prior year.SeagateSeagate (NASDAQ:STX) is in the same boat as Western Digital. A major supplier of HDDs, revenue in fiscal year 2016 decreased approximately 19%, or $2.6 billion, from fiscal year 2015 as a result of a decrease in shipments by 43 million units and price erosion.I discussed this in a recent Seeking Alpha article entitled, ""Will Micron Technology's Slap In The Face From Seagate Technology Catalyze A JV With Tsinghua Unigroup?""Executives at Seagate have already stated that they don't want to integrate a foundry-level, NAND chip-making business into its existing operation. But that was before:IntelIf we refer back to Table 3, Intel had a 6.3% share of the NAND flash market in Q3 2016 - a share that has been decreasing for the past four quarters.But Intel's new NAND Flash fab in Dalian, China, was supposed to achieve 10,000 wafers per month at the end of 2016, and its capacity will continue to expand gradually on a quarterly basis in 2017.SK HynixAnother possibility is SK Hynix. Toshiba has leading-edge 64-layer 3D NAND technology, but needs an infusion of money for R&D. SK Hynix could benefit from Toshiba's NAND technology (design and processing capabilities), as SK's 3D NAND technology trails that of Samsung and MU. Both companies are jointly developing MRAM and nanoimprint lithography technology.ChineseI've written numerous articles in Seeking Alpha articles about China's interest in memory. Three new Chinese DRAM and NAND companies could be in operation in a few years as China maintains an aggressive strategy to increase its semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.China's Tsinghua Unigroup initiated plans to buy U.S. memory manufacturer Micron Technology for $23 billion in 2015, but the bid was ultimately turned down by Micron executives.An investment in Toshiba by Tsinghua would be beneficial in two important ways:OthersBloomberg reports that non-memory manufacturers have expressed an interest, including equipment manufacturers Canon (NYSE:CAJ), Tokyo Electron (OTCPK:TOELF), as well as private equity firms Bain Capital LP and Permira. My focus of this article is the impact of this spin-off on other NAND users and suppliers.How much will it cost as an investment?The cost is difficult to ascertain, because Toshiba has not expressed clarity on the terms. Toshiba is considering a spin-off of its semiconductor business into a separate entity and then sell a 20% stake in the new company for $2.7 billion. But is that only for the new fab? It is not completely clear how the spin-off would affect the other four fabs that are jointly owned by Toshiba and WDC. Would Toshiba sell 20% of their 50.1% share in these four fabs?Assuming the spin-off is just for the new fab, the investor will need to spend $2.7 for the 20% share. But what about the new fab? Would the investor spend 20% of the cost or spend 50%, which is what SanDisk and WDC paid as their share in the four fabs? The new fab would probably cost $5 billion.In other words, what does the investor get for the $2.7 billion and 20% of the spin-off? Until we get some additional clarity from Toshiba, we cannot value the terms of the deal. But the stakes are high:We could see a battle for Toshiba's share, and if Western Digital doesn't win, its revenues going forward will be dramatically impacted. If it does win, the short-term bottom line will be negatively impacted as it shells out $2.7 billion.Micron Technology could benefit. As I discussed in the Seeking Alpha article ""Will Micron Technology's Slap In The Face From Seagate Technology Catalyze A JV With Tsinghua Unigroup?"" the move by Seagate to SK Hynix as its NAND supplier from traditional supplier MU created a vacuum in the latter company's revenue stream.If Toshiba picks a company other than WDC, that vacuum could be filled by getting additional NAND from MU, but it raises the issue of whether WDC would be willing to buy on the open market as Seagate was, or would continue its policy of demanding a stake in a company to guarantee supply. MU would have a say in the latter matter, and it would probably say no.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

        Shares of WDC have rallied to 52-week highs but remain well-below 2015 highs.
        This article explores how recent operating results compare to past periods of success.","Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) is an American computer data storage company. Along with Seagate Technology, this company is one of the largest computer hard disk drive manufacturers in the world.WDC has a unique area of expertise and a wealth of domain experience. But in our rapidly-changing and highly-competitive world of technology and computers, the company can't afford to rest on their laurels. On the other hand, the indefatigable proliferation of computing devices, and the ensuing data that needs to be stored, could present a secular tailwind for WDC.To try and determine which of these competing narratives is accurate, I'm going to take a deeper dive into the longer-term operating results of WDC. By looking at these numbers over a longitudinal period, I can try to determine if WDC can seize market opportunity or whether it will be pushed aside by competitors.Based on the recent share price performance, it seems investors may be betting on the former. After bottoming earlier this year, buyers have frantically rushed in to WDC and the stock is now being pushed to 52-week highs. Can this strength in share price continue?WDC Business Overview:WDC was founded in 1970 as General Digital, but just over a year later, the company adopted its current name and launched its first product, a universal asynchronous transmitter/receiver. Since then WDC has only continued to grow. The $19 billion dollar May 2016 acquisition of SanDisk only speaks to the enormous scale of this storage manufacturer.All of this business is currently reported as one segment: the hard drive business. As the company continues to digest the recent SanDisk acquisition, the reorganization and associated reporting with this segment will become clearer. In the meantime though, one thing jumps out: WDC is truly a global company. Revenue generation is spread relatively evenly across the globe, with Europe, Asia and North America all contributing billions to the top line (source).Unfortunately, despite growth in US revenue, WDC has been facing top-line headwinds in the rest of the world the last couple of year. And given the incredibly competitive nature of the data storage business, this revenue pressure is understandable. While hard-drive storage space was once a powerful differentiator, data storage has largely become commoditized. And this competitive environment presents a challenge for the company.On the other hand, WDC estimates that data storage growth will continue at approximately 40% per annum for the next several years (source). If their acquisitions, not to mention the ongoing efforts of their 11,3000 engineers to offer a broad range of data storage solutions, can tap into this market expansion then an investment in WDC could prove profitable.Interestingly, the company is also focused on the opportunity associated with content generation and management. They realize that customer stickiness may improve if they can help clients extract value from their stored data. This has particularly compelling applications for legal and compliance use cases. These higher-value service components of the WDC offering also provide an interesting upside lever.Now with this backdrop in mind, let's see how the actual operations of the company have held up recently, as compared to the last decade.WDC Financial History:To try and get a better grip on the supposed strong competitive position of WDC, I plan to look for trends in long-term operating results over a ten-year and trailing-twelve-month basis. I'm especially excited by consistent trends. That's because I'm a bit more confident in these more reliable numbers, when it comes to forecasting future results. So for starters, let's look at the top-line numbers. And by the way, all the data in the graphs below is from Morningstar (source), and I've created the graphs myself.The reason why I like to begin with sales numbers is because it gives a clear look at how companies are able to meet demand from their customers. Unfortunately in the case of WDC, it looks like end-user demand might be falling. This is not exactly the kind of trend I love to see.Although WDC has been able to grow sales in the past, the most recent couple of years have presented a plateau. While I'm encouraged the company is aggressively pursuing acquisitions to try and diversify and expand service offerings, only time will tell if this can continue. Given the strong competitive environment, I'm also worried that WDC could be losing more money on the sales it is making. To try and get a handle on this, let's look at how gross margins over the same period.To be honest with you, this trend is actually much better than I expected. I'm encouraged that management has remained discipline with their pricing and avoided the temptation to buy revenue when times get tough. On the other hand, it's also a little bit difficult to understand how these marginsAdditionally, these steady margins should provide some cushion to net income. And as shareholders, earnings are one of the most important attributes to be aware of. So how do they look?As you'd expect, while earnings and free cash flow were once in a strong uptrend, they have taken a hit in the last couple of years. This is simply a result of lower sales falling to the bottom line. You'll notice I also added in the free cash flow per share results to try and better illustrate the underlying trend given how accounting for the large acquisition can obscure operating results as they appear in net income. Finally, I also want to look at book value per share. The reason this is important to me is because as an equity holder, I want to see the value of my ownership stake in the company increase. All things being equal, WDC share price should follow suit as long as the company can keep growing book value on a per-share basis.Unfortunately, we once again see a similar trend. Despite impressive growth for the last 10 years, there's been a bit of a pause in the most recent twelve-month period. While this reversal of trend isn't as pronounced as the drop in revenue, it's still alarming considering the performance from 2007 - 2015.One mitigating factor however is that WDC has been paying out more of its earnings as a dividend. Naturally, this leaves less money to be retained to grow equity value. Although the dividend was only initiated in 2013, management has increased the distributions every year sinceAnd with the free-cash payout ratio below 50%, there's still room for increases. That said, if revenue remains under pressure I think dividend growth will as well. And that's only one of the potential risks to investing in WDC.Potential Risks to Investing in WDC:WDC is an interesting investment opportunity with some unique attributes. But there are also some serious risks to consider, including competitive pressures and the ability of management to resume profitable revenue growth. And that's just the tip of the iceberg.First of all, while WDC enjoys all the benefits and scale of being a large global company, it also comes with risk. With such a large geographic footprint, WDC is bound to suffer should global growth slow down further. This picture is further complicated by ongoing currency risk.Another area of potential concern is the ongoing integration of SanDisk. While this acquisition could certainly be accretive, there's also a significant amount of execution risk. If the company can't make the most of this opportunity shareholders will take a backseat to debt servicing costs. On the other hand, WDC does appear to be reasonably priced. By most metrics it trades at a discount to the S&P-500. The price-to-cash flow graph below illustrates this effectively (source).However, while the current gap appears wider than in previous years, it does narrow a bit when you adjust market capitalization for the enterprise value of over $27B (source). So what do we make of all this?Conclusion: Planning to Wait on WDC I believe WDC could present an attractive investment opportunity, but the company isn't out of the woods yet. To my eye, it appears WDC may be circling the wagons, focusing on core competencies and planning for the future by integrating with SanDisk. When you consider the valuation and high working capital position, I think the case is even more compelling.At present though, I don't own shares of WDC but primarily because I'm already fully invested. I'll consider adding to this position as cash becomes available and the company reports another quarter or two of top-line results. But what's your opinion? Do you think WDC is worthy of an investment?"

Roughly $656 billion in market value has been gained in 2016.Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) has been the ""biggest loser"" in large tech thus far in 2016, driven by many short-term challenges and has lost 25.9% in 2016, or $8.1 billion in market value. Meanwhile, the ""biggest winner"" YTD is Weibo Corp (NASDAQ:WB), which has gained 154.1% in 2016, or $6.1 billion in market value. This gain is driven by recent earnings outperformance and the strength in its micro-blogging platform, which is expected to generate strong growth for the company.Let's take a closer look at some metrics.Diving deeper into the dataThe top 20 tech YTD losers of the week have a median forward P/E of 20.7x, compared to the S&P 500's median trailing P/E of 14.6x and the overall tech sector's 24.8x.

And which should they avoid, despite the price drops?Based on metrics alone and using the table above, income investors might want to take a closer look at SSE PLC (OTCPK:SSEZY), a stock that pays a relatively generous 5.8% dividend yield and sells at a modest 16.4x forward earnings. Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX) also pays a high dividend yield for the sector, but Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) appears more attractive from a valuation standpoint.Let's take a closer look at one name that featured on tech's top 20 ""biggest loser"" list this week.WDC: SanDisk Merger Poses More Long-term Benefits than ChallengesToday, we will focus on the second biggest loser on the list, Western Digital.Down over 21% since the beginning of the year, the company has reported mixed earnings results over the past year after it announced its acquisition of SanDisk in October 2015. It seems as if the jury is still out on whether or not Western Digital overpaid for SanDisk at a steep price of $19 billion in cash and stock. This deal included roughly $18 billion in debt financing, a number so large that it exceeds Western Digital's current market capitalization. While it is true that the company will see its financing costs increase in the short- to intermediate-term, long-term value investors might view the deal as an opportunity for Western Digital to position itself for a more promising future, as the company diversifies away from traditional hard drives into solid state storage.The bull caseMuch of WDC's recent struggles have been attributed to the declining hard disk drive (HDD) market and its competition with Seagate Technologies (STX). The stock has reacted accordingly, having pulled back 21% YTD as of the beginning of September. By purchasing SanDisk, however, WDC is looking to expand into the SSD (solid state drive) market that SanDisk successfully operated in. SSD runs in many machines that HDD drives cannot operate in and has taken over many laptops and tablets, a trend that we believe is most likely to continue to grow every year. Not only might the SanDisk acquisition help Western Digital re-ignite growth, the company predicts that the deal would generate over $1 billion of annual synergies by 2020 and nearly $500 million in the first year. I calculate that these synergies, if achieved, should generate upwards of $3.00/share in benefits, suggesting that consensus 2017 EPS of $6.40, up from $4.45 in 2016, might be conservative. Considering the sharp price drop in 2016, Western Digital could very well bounce back from the lows, should the SanDisk merger prove to be as synergistic as management seems to believe.In addition, in the near-term, investors are likely to hang on to the attractive 4.3% dividend yield that WDC offers, as the company has steadily increased dividends every year for the past few years. This stable source of income should be enough of a short-term benefit for a long-term investor waiting on capital gains while integration is completed. The high yield could also help to set a floor for the stock. WDC currently trades at a very low PEG of 0.2 and a forward P/E of 11.0x, which are among the lowest of the 20 ""biggest losers"".Given the attractive valuation, high dividend yield and projected EPS growth of 47%, we believe that this could be a good time to buy Western Digital ahead of a potential turnaround, which we believe could happen even before 2016 is over.See below the company's upward-revised guidance (issued on September 7th) for F1Q17.Source: company slides, Citi Global Technology ConferenceThe bear caseSA author Chris Lau believes that the marriage of two companies with less-than-exciting prospects (increasing competition, falling margins) may not bode so well for Western Digital. He also argues that the servicing of the increased debt may push storage space companies like Western Digital to try to ""boost sales at any cost, increasing output and accepting any product selling price. Ultimately, this will mean lower profit margins for all players"".The scenario may become even bleaker if Western Digital is not able to recognize the expected synergies or if it experiences trouble with the integration of SanDisk. Additionally, heavy competition from companies such as Seagate , Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) can pose further pressure to the stock, as all three competitors have been struggling this year as well.Research report authored by Jared Kirsch, CFA, edited by Daniel Martins.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

That article can be read here. Just a week after that piece was published, Chinese regulators signed off on the deal and the acquisition closed. Now we have the combined entity selling both HDDs and flash memory valued at about $11 billion. In this article, I will assess Western Digital to determine if the current valuation is too cheap for what's under the hood.The most recent sources of WDC shares' woes was the company's fourth quarter report, which sparked a selloff of more than 12%. Operating expenses ramped up due to the SanDisk acquisition, resulting in a GAAP net loss, and general investor uncertainty was abound. However, after looking at the results, I think WDC is on the right track for long-term success.Before moving I would like to explain that I think using non-GAAP numbers is more informative than GAAP measures for merger-related accounting. The non-GAAP EPS numbers give a more accurate portrayal of the company's business operations during the quarter, and do not include the one-time expenses and costs that are incurred during the transitionary period. This is not to say that the costs should not be accounted for, but I think the non-GAAP numbers provide better insight into how the combined entity will perform going forward.In the fourth quarter 2016 press release, WDC reported revenue of $3.5 billion, which beat consensus estimates by $40 million and was up 9% year-over-year (""YoY""), non-GAAP EPS of $0.79, which beat by 8 cents, and non-GAAP gross margin was 31%. The latter two figures are not particularly impressive, but they are short-term consequences of the SanDisk acquisition. Operating expenses were $691 million in Q4, up 45% sequentially from Q3, and with little in the way of cost synergies between Western Digital, an HDD manufacturer, and SanDisk, an SSD manufacturer, the operating cost savings may not be too significant. Operating expenses are expected to balloon in Q1 2017 as well, to $875 million as the quarter will fully include SanDisk's expenses in contrast with only partial inclusion in Q4.Regardless, with the HDD market moribund, the acquisition was a must. And despite the current combined entity's unwieldy structure and organization, the business is still running smoothly enough. Free cash flow for the quarter was $141 million, WDC is preparing for the launch of 3D NAND in 2017 with additional capacity expansion, and the company guided for first quarter 2017 non-GAAP EPS between $0.85 and $0.90 on revenues of about $4.45 billion.Though FY2017 will surely be a bit hectic with SanDisk's ongoing integration and therefore increased operating expenses, I think the results from Q4 2016 provide reason to be bullish about WDC going forward. Even if absolutely no more operating improvements or growth were factored into the three quarters of 2017 following Q1, meaning EPS stays the same, FY2017 EPS would still come out to about $3.50, which would put WDC at a bit over 13x 2017 earnings.I expect that to be a conservative estimate as, despite the differences in business models, there is always room for optimization on the cost side. CEO Stephen Milligan acknowledged this fact on the conference call, stating that core operating expenses would begin to come down following Q1 2017 as synergies are realized. Additionally, revenue growth is likely to ramp up as well as the HDD market has hit a bit of a bottom for the time being (likely not very long) and 3D NAND shipments will begin in first half of calendar year 2017 (Q3 and Q4 2017).At $10 billion, Western Digital seems like a bargain right now. With the combined revenues of WDC and SanDisk, the company is trading at what I expect will be about 0.5x 2017 revenue and about 13x 2017 earnings (conservatively). Strangely enough, In recent months WDC has been outdone by Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), which still derives about 95% of revenue from the HDD market. Western Digital has much better positioning for the future than Seagate, and I expect the market to pick up on this as soon as the merger-related issues stop obscuring the real value of the company.I think WDC is a bargain at its current valuation and that investors may be wise to pick up shares. The potential upside cannot be ignored by the market for very long, though increased expenses may obfuscate fair value for a few quarters. I think WDC made the correct long-term move by acquiring SanDisk and expect this will strengthen the combined entity in the crowded memory space. WDC's HDD sales and profits will be the cash cow for the next few years while SanDisk provides the growth. Due to the strength of the company's fundamentals, the low current valuation, and a nice dividend yield of about 4%, I rate Western Digital a Strong Buy on the drop.If you want to stay up-to-date on my articles, you can ""Follow"" me by going to my author page or by clicking ""Follow"" at the top of this page.Thanks for reading!"
3983468,45851,2016-06-21T16:11:05-04:00,"Like its sector peers, Western Digital has been battered by poor demand for its main product.The acquisition of SanDisk, which was meant to boost Western Digital’s revenue profile, came with a heavy debt price tag.The burgeoning debt burden is putting too much risk on the dividend to make this a buy.","Poor Fiscal Third Quarter Amidst Completion of SanDisk Acquisition Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), which together with Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), are the two most recognizable names in the Hard Disk Drive ('HDD') business, had a lousy fiscal 2016 third quarter. Western Digital reported earnings of $1.21 a share, which was 7 cents short of the consensus analyst estimate and a decline of 26% compared to the $1.63 a share that it earned a year earlier.The tepid results from Western Digital, which completed the $16 billion acquisition of SanDisk (SNDK) in May, was the result of continued weakness in the PC market and was in keeping with trends anticipated by Western Digital itself. Hard drive shipments contracted by 17% in 2015 - faster than the 8% contraction in PC shipments - and Western Digital forecasted that the total available market for hard drives would contract by 100 million (or around 21%) in 2016.Dividend Impact and Outlook. As a result of its poor quarter, Western Digital shares have dropped by nearly 20% this year - and this is after an analyst upgrade (brought about by insider buying) that lifted the stock.Of course, the real question is how the acquisition of SanDisk will impact Western Digital's ability to pay dividends. The company currently has a 50 cent per share dividend and has paid a quarterly one over the last three years. The stock's dividend yield is 4.29%, which is among the highest in its sector. That means that investors who invest $10,000 in Western Digital stand to earn $429 in passive income over a year's time.On the face of it, the SanDisk acquisition should provide an immediate boost to Western Digital's flagging revenues. Western Digital released guidance that it expected its fiscal 2016 4th quarter revenues to reach as much as $3.45 billion - an 8% improvement compared to the same period a year earlier.However, as a result of the transaction, Western Digital's earnings are expected to dip between 60 and 70 cents per share - 60% lower than the same period in fiscal 2015 - owing to $250 million in interest and debt-issuance costs, much of which is associated with the acquisition of SanDisk. Right here, investors can see that debt servicing could eventually become a hurdle to dividend payments, particularly if Western Digital's gross margins continue to dip as they have for the last four quarters and the savings and margin improvements that it expects from the SanDisk deal do not materialize.Investors should note that Western Digital's earnings do not yet reflect the full impact of the $14.1 billion in debt that Western Digital issued to finance the SanDisk acquisition. Based on the $5.2 billion in new 7- and 8-year bonds that it recently issued, Western Digital's cost of debt for the SanDisk deal is in the 9.4% range - or towards the high-end for high yield bonds.Assuming that the rest of its SanDisk-related borrowings are in the same coupon range, Western Digital is looking at a $1.3 billion per year interest bill over the next 7 to 8 years. To be sure, Western Digital anticipates that it will realize $350 in annual savings as a result of the acquisition - but it will likewise have to incur $800 million in cumulative cash expenses in 2016 ($480 million) and 2017 ($320 million) in order to do so.Everything else being equal, this net increase in costs would cause Western Digital's working capital ratio, which is currently at a robust 3.14 to 1, to dip to 2.06 to 1 over the next year, bringing it in line with the average for its industry. In the medium term, Western Digital has suggested that it could realize as much as $1.1 billion in cost savings from the SanDisk deal, which would wipe out much of the negative carry from its new debt and bring its working capital ratio closer to its current level.In any case, Western Digital currently has cash of nearly $5.9 billion and a quick ratio of 2.6 to 1, which is far higher than that of its peer group. Even accounting for a very large increase in its interest payments and the cash expenses from the SanDisk deal, Western Digital has the wherewithal to pay over $600 million in dividends - but until when it can do so is uncertain.To wit, a very real source of concern is Western Digital's gearing, which currently stands at 23 cents per dollar of equity. Not considering other balance sheet additions that the SanDisk acquisition could bring, the issuance of $14.1 billion in debt will raise Western Digital's gearing to $1.70 per dollar of equity - far higher than the 30 cent industry average - and around the level of leverage that is considered normal for banks.Moreover, despite the SanDisk acquisition, Western Digital's revenues are expected to remain flat over the next 5 years - a sign that analysts share Western Digital's dour assessment of the Hard Drive market. Indeed, analysts have downgraded their earnings forecast for the stock continuously over the last 90 days.ConclusionThe outlook for Western Digital is clearly mixed, and we are concerned that not enough attention is being paid to its heavy leveraging, which could have very serious repercussions on its ability to pay dividends in the medium term, among other things.While higher leverage shouldn't impact the company's ability to pay dividends over the next four quarters, when combined with the poor outlook for the sector, a very dark picture emerges for the stock, and we would recommend that investors avoid it for now - high dividend yield notwithstanding."
4030385,21798,2016-12-14T05:49:55-05:00,Western Digital is benefiting from strong demand for its data storage products.The stock will be driven higher as earnings get a boost from a higher gross margin and lower tax rate.The stock is attractively valued as compared to its peers and the S&P 500.,"Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is currently in a recovery phase after slumping from the beginning of 2015 through the first half of 2016. The company is seeing strong demand for its hard drive and flash-based products, which is driving top line growth. The bottom line will benefit from an expanding gross margin and a lower tax rate. The SanDisk acquisition is another plus to add to the company's future performance. The stock is still attractively valued even after the recent run up in price. Therefore, I think the stock looks poised to outperform over the next year.Top Line GrowthWestern Digital is experiencing strong demand from all categories of customers. This is evident in the nearly 50% year-over-year growth in total exabytes shipped that the company achieved in Q1. The demand is mostly being driven by cloud and mobility based apps. Better than expected PC demand is also contributing to the strong demand.Western Digital stated in the Q1 conference call that demand is strong for the company's HDDs, which is being driven by cloud-related applications. Demand has also picked up for SSDs for PCs as the market shows signs of stabilizing. Western Digital's OEM and cloud customers are increasingly using WDC's 10 terabyte helium drives. The company is seeing sales strength for its NAND solutions in mobile phones.Many PC related companies have been hurt from the increased use of smartphones and tablets over PCs. However, the PC market is showing signs of recovery. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) increased Q3 revenue guidance by 4.7% in September as PC makers replenish laptop and desktop inventories. The higher demand will spill over to Western Digital for the company's data storage solutions.I expect demand for PCs to stabilize and grow in 2017 as businesses spend money to upgrade as the economy continues to pick up. This will help drive demand for Western Digital's HDDs, SSDs and flash storage products.Western Digital is getting a significant revenue boost from the SanDisk acquisition. SanDisk brought in $5.56 billion in revenue in 2015. The acquisition will help Western Digital achieve a 40% increase in revenue for FY17 to over $18 billion.Bottom Line GrowthWestern Digital is getting better than expected pricing for its HDD and flash products. The company is also benefitting from product cost improvements. The company expects the non-GAAP gross margin to increase from 35% to 36% in Q2 as a result of this.Western Digital's tax rate is expected to decrease from 14% to 16% down to 13% in Q2. When you combine the higher margin with a lower tax rate, overall profitability will increase. In response to this, the company increased its estimate for Q2 non-GAAP EPS from $1.80 - $1.95 to the new range of $2.10 to $2.15, a double-digit increase. This will help drive the stock higher as these estimates are achieved.Valuation is Still AttractiveAlthough the stock made strong gains recently, it is still valued attractively as compared to most of its industry peers and to the broader market.Here's how Western Digital compares:Data Source: Finviz.com, multpl.comAlthough Seagate has the lower valuation according to price/sales, Seagate is only expected to grow EPS at under 1% next year. Western Digital is expected to grow EPS at a higher double-digit rate of 17% for FY18. Brocade and NetApp are also expected to grow EPS at lower rates of 5% and 12% respectively over the same period. Therefore, Western Digital stands out as an attractively valued investment in data storage with strong expected growth.Risks to the Investment ThesisDemand for Western Digital's products can fluctuate significantly. Downturns in the PC market or for cloud storage can have a significant negative effect on Western Digital's stock. If the economy performs worse than expected over the next year, the demand for Western Digital's products would likely be reduced, thus negatively impacting sales and the stock.ConclusionThe stock looks like it is just beginning to pullback after a strong run-up. The stock typically sells off by about 10% to 15% after becoming overbought. So, I would recommend putting in a buy order at about $60. That would take the stock down near the 50-day moving average, where it should have support with the positive catalysts in play and with the positive momentum in the economy. The valuation and earnings growth for FY18 should support an approximate gain of 17% over the next year."
3974881,87676,2016-05-13T11:52:43-04:00,"Before the acquisition, Western Digital was a dominant player in a declining HDD market.SanDisk acquisition has changed the competitive landscape.Short-term headwinds masked long-term growth potential.","Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC)-the leading Hard Disk Drive (HDD) maker-has been feeling the pressure in the past 12 months due to an accelerated decline in PC sales and increased adoption of Solid State Drive (SSD). Last year, the company acquired SanDisk, an SSD maker, to diversify its business. The market thought that Western Digital paid an unjustifiably high price for SanDisk at a time when the competition in the SSD market was heating up due to 3-D NAND technology. The company's stock price declined from $100 to $37. However, this acquisition has the potential to fundamentally change the risk profile of WDC in the impending technology shift. Despite short-term headwinds, the storage market will grow in the long term and Western Digital is best positioned to benefit.Investment ThesisThe HDD market came a long way via consolidation to reach the state of trioploy in 2012. Western Digital (43%), Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) (42%), and Toshiba (15%) have since maintained a balanced market and earned decent returns. During this period, Western Digital achieved a 28%/22% Gross/EBITDA margin and maintained an average ROIC of 14%. However, nothing is static in technology, especially for commoditized hardware. The emergence of SSD has slowly intruded into the HDD market. The development of 3-D NAND may further lower the cost of SSD and break the balance in the HDD trioploy.Although the acquisition of SanDisk may appear to be expensive, it completely changed Western Digital's risk profile. Of the three storage technologies, the new Western Digital's products are the leaders in HDD and planar SSD. The company is also fighting in the new 3-D NAND development. Before the acquisition, there was a risk that the success of 3-D NAND would permanently shrink Western Digital's addressable market. Now, however, Western Digital's technology portfolio ensures that it can prosper under all scenarios. Moreover, Toshiba's small share in the HDD market and joint venture with SanDisk will provide it with an incentive to improve its cooperation with Western Digital and this will put pressure on pure players like Seagate.Instead of completely replacing HDD, SSD provides a cost-effective way for certain applications. The future of storage will be a mix of both devices. But it is also incorrect for the bulls to assume that all data will just move to the cloud without any impact on storage demand. Indeed, most of the pain in the HDD market was caused by shifting to the cloud. In the short to medium term during this transition, both the HDD and SSD will be under pressure. But after the transition, storage demand will again match the exponential data growth, and Western Digital is best positioned to capture that growth.Company overviewWestern Digital is a hardware maker in the storage segment, mainly HDD, which can be categorized as a commodity despite some differences in the quality and technology. It was very hard for companies to achieve excess returns in the early stages. However, the industry experienced several rounds of consolidation between 2000 and 2012. Currently, three companies controlled 100% of the market, with Western Digital leading at 40%. The company has improved its EBITDA margin from below 5% to constantly over 20%.With data growing and the PC market booming, global HDD shipments recorded a 17% CAGR from 1990 to 2010. Since then, overall unit demand has declined due to decreasing PC sales and the emerging SSD. Although three companies still maintain a balanced market and decent returns, accelerated declines in recent quarters and the development of 3-D NAND technology have signaled trouble ahead. This is why Western Digital entered into an agreement to purchase SanDisk in 2015.Underestimated acquisitionWhat Western Digital paid for its acquisition is clear. The elevated multiple is the most controversial part in the market and the new debt is an additional cost. However, if investors will consider the intangibles that WDC got from the deal, then the overall picture looks different.On a standalone basis, the SanDisk acquisition may seem to be unreasonably expensive, but from the industry's point of view, the combined company will gain a much stronger position. To simplify, the storage business can be classified into three technologies. The HDD has matured and held most of the digital data in the past. It has the lowest cost, but its performance is also relatively slow. The traditional SSD is much faster than HDD, but it is also at least 5x more expensive. The latest technology, the 3-D NAND, has the potential to massively lower the cost of SSD and make it competitive with HDD in more applications. However, the characteristics of HDD and SSD ensure that both will be used in the future storage business. The technological issue is now more about mixing and matching the right hardware to a specific application. Below is a summary of the technology portfolios of the major players in the industry.Technologies portfolio of major industry players:Before the SanDisk acquisition, investors in WDC worried about the new 3-D NAND technology that could replace HDD on a large scale. Actually, it could be a question of survival for WDC. The success of 3-D NAND may permanently shrink its addressable market and break the balance of the HDD triopoly. With the acquisition, WDC now has the ability to weather all kinds of scenarios. If 3-D NAND turns out to be a huge success, WDC is in a much better position versus Seagate and is more likely to dominate the remaining HDD market. If 3-D NAND fails, WDC's leading position in the HDD and traditional SSD will still help it to succeed in the storage market. Ironically, the WDC stock price was trading at a much higher level when there were huge long-term risks to the company before the acquisition.Another overlooked factor is Toshiba (OTC:TSHTF). Its existing SSD joint venture with SanDisk can help to improve cooperation between Toshiba and Western Digital, even in the HDD market. This would put Seagate in a very difficult position. Although Toshiba only has ~20% of the HDD market compared with ~40% each for WDC and Seagate, this dynamic becomes important in a potentially shrinking HDD market. Eventually, there may need to be further consolidation in the industry, and the loser is increasingly likely to be Seagate. Again, ironically, STX was performing much better versus WDC after the acquisition.Storage demand will grow, but it will take a whileThe shift to the cloud has claimed a lot of casualties in both the software and hardware industries. Its impact on the storage segment is a bit complicated. The growth of the underlining data has never been stronger, but the storage manufacturers seem to be suffering. To have a better understanding, we can divide growth into two stages, and the first is the transition to the cloud. During this stage, demand for storage will actually go down. Unlike in the PC era where HDD had a relatively low utilization rate (mine was below 50%), that rate will now increase and less total storage will be needed in the cloud platform. Moreover, instead of having 100 of the same files on 100 PCs, now you need only one in the cloud. At this stage, the main theme is to improve the efficiency of storage systems. However, there is a limit to this efficiency. This brings us to the second stage where storage demand will eventually catch up with the data growth.The acquisition has put Western Digital in a very comfortable position to benefit from the long-term data growth. We can divide the storage market in a different way: 1) DRAM, the memory that works alongside CPU to facilitate fast calculations, 2) end users, traditionally PC and now also those mobile devices, and 3) storage, the major devices that store most of the data for the long-term. Below is a summary of the segments and the players.Different industry classification:Source: Company dataDRAM and end-user segments are actually not highly correlated with the long term data growth. DRAM is more about improving the performance with the CPU. With the trend of cloud architecture, less data is stored on the user end. The task of storing future data will fall to the middle part with the usage of both HDD and SSD. Western Digital, after the acquisition, is best positioned to capture the long-term growth in this segment.ValuationWestern Digital announced the closure of SanDisk acquisition on May 12. On the pro forma basis, with conservatively estimated synergies from both SNDK and MOFCOM, Western Digital can achieve adjusted earnings of around $1.9bn in CY2018. 18-month price target of $68 with implied P/E of 10x. Current market price is suggesting that there won't be any synergies.Despite recent headwinds, the storage market is still a solid industry in the long term with limited players. The acquisition of SanDisk gave Western Digital more competitive advantage over its peers with an attractive technology portfolio. Although the growth will take some time to materialize, the depressed valuation is not justified and provides an opportunity for investors."

3983105,101466,2016-06-20T11:52:35-04:00,"Western Digital has a strong case as an undervalued stock with considerable upside.Past declines in Western Digital's stock price represent an overreaction to market trends and have left WDC trading below its fair value.Future outlook for WDC remains bright, brighter than competitors with the recent acquisition of SanDisk.","(Image Source: Company Website)Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:WDC) provides hope as an industry leader in the failing Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Market. The hope does not come from conditions the market, but rather from the company strategy, and their recent merger with SanDisk, whose main streams of revenue come from markets ready to capitalize on the fall of HDD.Hard Disk Drives, or HDD, are metallic drives, made from a magnetic disk that rapidly spins, which allows for the storage and retrieval of information. Hard Disk Drives were created in the early 1950s, and became the standard for secondary storage for most computers in the early 1960s. Hard disk drives have continued to evolve and grow in effectiveness since their inception, and are now found most prominently as internal and external storage devices for most computers and laptops. Hard Disk Drives were favored in these devices primarily because of their storage capacity, as the devices are capable of storing upwards of 1,000 GB of data. The primary creators of Hard Disk Drives are Western Digital Corporation , Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX), who own about 40% of the market share each, and Toshiba (TYO JPY), who own about 20% of the market share.The market for Hard Disk Drives however, has been declining, as Solid State Drives (NYSE:SSD) and Flash technology have come into existence. Newer laptops and computers now use this technology as their primary source of storage, because SSD and Flash technologies have superior data transfer rates, and are more reliable than HDD. At the moment, HDD technology is only superior to SSD and Flash technology when it comes to storage costs, and as a result, in certain situations SSD and Flash technologies are utilized where in the past HDD would normally have been used. The HDD market is expected to decline in the coming years, and most analysts predict it will decline anywhere from 2-5% over the next five years. WDC will likely suffer from the decline in revenues, as will Toshiba and Seagate, however, the market itself is unlikely to decline to a rate where HDD is completely unused. HDD continues to be used, and should continue to be used in secondary storage, as the cost-effectiveness associated with HDD will likely keep the technology relevant, and the need for greater storage capacities will greatly inflate the perception associated with cost per unit storage that HDD provides.The Solid State Drive industry, and Flash Drive industry are set to capitalize on this decline in the HDD industry. Overall need for storage systems in computers and external drives is still important, and is set to grow, but whereas the HDD market is on the decline, the SSD and Flash market are growing rapidly. Solid State Drives use integrated circuits to store data, as opposed to some kind of moving drive like a Hard Disk Drive would. In fact, these Solid State Drives have no moving parts at all, making them more durable, and quieter than their moving counterparts. The Solid State Drives utilize the Flash technology as well, and run in many machines that HDD drives cannot operate in. The key players in the SSD market are Samsung, SanDisk, Micron, and Intel, with Samsung retaining a 44.7% market share, SanDisk an 11.1% market share, Micron a 9.7% market share, and Intel an 8.9% market share. What is interesting to note is that WDC retains a considerably smaller market share, and derives most of its revenue from the sale of its Hard Disk Drives, making it a seemingly irrelevant player in the SSD market. SSD has taken over many laptops, and is especially prevalent in tablets, and industry that continues to grow every year. The SSD market is projected to grow at a 30-40% CAGR over the next five years according to analysts.WDC earns its strength in the SSD market through the acquisition of SanDisk. The deal closed for $15.1billion and just under one quarter of a share for every share of SanDisk on May 12, 2016. While the debt load that WDC assumed to finance the deal seems immense, the company was able to properly restructure their existing debt in order to lighten the overall debt load, and to insulate themselves, so that most of the debt obligations would not be paid until after a successful integration of SanDisk. The main concern from the deal comes from SanDisk itself, and its technology of NAND-Based Flash. The company produces 2D NAND-Based Flash in a market that is quickly and rapidly growing into 3D NAND-Based Flash, and the main concern is the timeline SanDisk has set for their own 3D NAND-Based Flash devices. However, the general consensus at the time of the deal was that SanDisk's technology should be able to produce 3D NAND-Based Flash, and even since the finalization of the deal, reports have been more positive, that 3D NAND-Based Flash is not far off. Essentially, the outlook on the merger has improved recently, despite only closing a few months ago, on May 12.ValuationWDC on its own is stronger than its comparable companies. Using a comparable companies analysis, we were able to analyze the fact that WDC has lower multiples than its competitors, even though it is in a highly commoditized industry. To add to this, WDC's Hard Disk Drives are seen as slightly better than its competitors, which in turn gives them a slight edge over the competition. And yet, with the Comparable Companies analysis, we returned a price target of $105.63, which accounts for 127% upside. We believe that the price target obtained here is not feasible in any capacity, but it does reflect in general terms our beliefs on the company. The reason for the high price target is that WDC trades at a significantly lower value than its peers, with most of its multiples less than one-half of those retained by other companies. We also believe that this may be a symptom of WDC being constantly undervalued and Seagate Technologies and other peers being simultaneously overvalued. Similarly, its closest peer, Seagate Technologies, has multiples that are 2x or even 3x or greater than WDC. For this reason, we believe in the underlying concept obtained in our Comparable Companies model, in that WDC, who sells a competing and even superior product to Seagate Technologies, should trade at a similar level to Seagate Technologies, and yet doesn't. However, we also believe that WDC is intrinsically very strong as well, and this intrinsic strength.The strength in WDC comes from a few key places, which in tandem make for a fantastic investment opportunity in the company. The first strength of the stock is in its recent decline. Over the past year, WDC has declined by around 50%, falling from prices in the low $90 range to the mid $40 range. The main reason for this drop was in the fear of the declining HDD market, and while some of those fears were justified, the stock price decreased by more than what we feel would be considered a fair value of the industry leader. Using conservative valuation methods with a Discounted Cash Flow analysis, we believe that WDC on its own with its predominantly HDD based revenue would be fairly valued at a price of just over $65. This price target was obtained using conservative growth values of an average of -5.9% over seven years, and holding gross margins and costs at similar levels over the next seven years, which would be in line with a highly commoditized product. It should be noted that we used our comparable companies median EV/EBITDA multiple, which was 6.03. We also used a very conservative perpetuity growth rate of -7%, which would account for a higher level of revenue decline than is predicted by most analysts, and will ultimately bring revenue down toward $0, which most analysts agree will most likely not happen, as there is should still be a need for HDD in the future, just not as strong of one as seen in the past.However, the real strength of the company lies in its recent acquisition, its merger with SanDisk. SanDisk has been a key player in the SSD marketspace, one in which WDC has been losing its HDD customers to. What is interesting in this deal is that WDC was able to restructure its debt, and should be able to easily pay off the debt once it has successfully integrated SanDisk into the company. Another positive about the acquisition is that we can almost safely say ""once it has successfully integrated SanDisk into the company"", rather than ""if"", because SanDisk is such a similar company to WDC. Even though SanDisk and WDC focus on different products, SSD for SanDisk and HDD for WDC, their products are direct competitors, and have the same functions in computers and other devices. Furthermore, though small, WDC does have an SSD product line that is similar to SanDisk's. Because of the similarities of the companies, the merger should go very smoothly, and WDC should reap the benefits in terms of synergies associated with cost cutting. In fact, WDC has predicted that it should have close to $1billion of annual synergies by 2020, and close to $500M annually within the first year. While the deal was worth more than $15billion, the synergies are nonetheless staggering. To account for the deal, we used two different versions of the discounted cash flow analysis, one in which previous SanDisk revenue is counted for WDC, and one in which the revenue is not counted toward WDC until 2016. In both models we got a price target of $68.27, which represents 46% upside. One thing to note about this valuation, is that we used a Terminal multiple of 6.80, which is in line with most analysts, and we used a perpetuity growth rate of 0.45% to offset the declining revenue of HDD and the growing revenue of SSD, which by the final year of the model at are similar levels. These numbers gave us very different valuations in the long run, with the perpetuity growth method outweighing the Terminal Value output. However, we believe that the chosen 0.45% perpetuity growth rate is appropriate, as over time we feel that Western Digital's newfound SSD line should eventually overtake and outpace revenue coming from its existing HDD line, and we feel the focus will also shift into the company's SSD line. By doing so, this should increase the growth rate in perpetuity to follow closer to the normal 2-2.5% normally seen by mature companies. However, we feel the risk associated with the successful installment and capitalization on the SSD market does factor into the decision, hence the lower multiple and output for the Terminal Multiple method. Regardless, we feel confident in Western Digital.Overall, we believe Western Digital Corporation is undervalued, and is in reality worth closer to $60, representing about 30% upside from its current position of $46.59. This takes into account all of our conservative models, and places heavy emphasis on the more negative results. As a result, we feel confident that WDC presents a potentially favorable investment with little downside, and the capability for significant upside in the future."

Context is important here: Pandora (NYSE:P) went into earnings down over 75% from its early-2014 highs, and trades for just 1.6x its 2016 sales consensus. Against such a backdrop, beating sales estimates (while missing on EPS), slightly improving full-year revenue guidance, and moderately reducing full-year adjusted EBITDA loss guidance is enough to spark a rally.Nonetheless, with Spotify and Apple Music still seeing strong growth, and Amazon's Prime Music and Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) YouTube Red also providing competition, listener hours rose just 4% Y/Y to 5.52B. Active listeners totaled 79.4M, down 1.7M Q/Q and up 0.2M Y/Y.

Among other things, Pandora plans to leverage the volumes of listener data it has amassed over the years to deliver personalized playlists and recommendations (as well as upsell web radio listeners on the subscription service), and (in contrast to the $10/month, one-size-fits-all approach taken by rivals) create multiple pricing tiers catering to different types of music fans.Rovi buying TiVo for $1.1B in cash and stock - Following several rumors of a pending deal, it's official.

Apple, secretive as ever, has given no indication as to what it's using the acquired fab for.The facility is much too small to handle production of Apple's A-series processors (currently made by TSMC/Samsung), and besides, developing the advanced manufacturing processes needed for them would be a multi-billion dollar investment. But Apple's chip development work has expanded to cover other chips such as fingerprint sensors, SSD controllers, and LCD timing controllers.

In a statement, the company says it's ""removing certain parts of the LiveRail business that weren't creating value,"" such as LiveRail's ad server the certain publishers that didn't meet Facebook's quality standards.Facebook has been trying to sell publishers on its Atlas ad server (there have apparently been some challenges here as well), which the company claims can deliver superior cross-device ad tracking and measurement than rival platforms such as Google's DoubleClick thanks to its reliance on anonymized Facebook user profiles rather than cookies. Also, in a move highlighting Facebook's interest in ad quality, the company recently pulled the plug on an Atlas ad-buying solution after finding it was plagued by ""bad ads and fraud."" Notably, Facebook said at the time video ad native ads were the two formats delivering ""significant value"" for publishers.

Bloomberg recently reported Snapchat is now seeing 10B daily video videos, up from 8B in February - Snapchat's Stories feature, which lets users share photos/videos that disappear after 24 hours, has fueled much of the growth.

It could also give T-Mobile a chance (at a price) to narrow Verizon/AT&T's rural coverage edge, and potentially (though this might be easier said than done) open the door for a bidder such as Comcast or Dish Network (NASDAQ:DISH) to launch a new nationwide mobile network.Wells Fargo thinks AT&T could spend $10B through the auction, T-Mobile $8B, and Verizon $5B.

A Verizon offering appears to be on the way, and Apple has reportedly delayed a planned entry into the market due to licensing issues. The fact its owners control many popular TV channel should aid Hulu's entry into the market.In spite of strong old-media support (or perhaps because of it), Hulu is a distant third in the subscription streaming market behind Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). The company finally gained the sense to provide an ad-free option for Hulu Plus last year, but at $11.99/month, it's more costly than either Netflix or Amazon Prime. An online TV service featuring its owners' channels (and presumably others) and bundled traditional Hulu far would let Hulu change the playing field.Two lingering questions for Hulu's service: 1) Will Comcast, which is trying to minimize pay-TV subscriber losses, agree to license NBC's channels at a reasonable price? The WSJ says Comcast ""hasn't agreed to license its networks"" yet. 2) Will Hulu price the service in a way that will appeal to many cord-cutters, or will it (given Comcast's concerns and Disney/Fox's interest in keeping pay-TV clients happy) go with large channel bundles and premium pricing? Given the huge compromises Hulu has made to date to keep its owners happy - the free/ad-supported Hulu service still isn't supported on living room devices such as Roku's set-tops and Apple TV - the devil could end up being in the details.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

This implies that market strongly disfavors the SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) deal and/or market is pricing in a sharp deterioration of the company's fundamentals due to secular headwinds to the hard drive markets. My thesis calls into question both of these perceptions. I believe the post-merger scenario offers an upside over 50% while the downside from here is largely limited to 37%. The asymmetric risk-reward profile prompts me to consider this as one of the best long-term opportunities of 2016.Company InformationWestern Digital Corporation is a California-based data storage solutions company. Its main products are hard disk drives (HDD, 95% of revenue in 2015) and solid-state drives (SSDs), including brands such as HGST, WD, and G-Technology. WDC enjoys a meaningful market duopoly with Seagate Plc (NASDAQ:STX) in the HDD space. The company sells to both PC (nearly 59% of shipments) and non-PC manufacturers (41%). Its major markets are Asia (50% of revenue), Americas (28%) and EMEA (22%). Also, the company's key business channels are original equipment manufacturers (64% of revenue), distributors (23%) and retailers (13%). WDC seeks to grow its footprint in SSDs through a spree of acquisitions, such as Amplidata ($267m, 2015), Virident ($685m, 2013), sTec ($336m, 2013), VeloBit ($341m, 2013). Its biggest customer is HP, accounting for 11% of revenue in 2015. Over the past three years, sales to top 10 customers account for 44% of revenue. The above financial figures are sourced from 10-K while the deal sizes are found in Capital IQ.On 10/21/2015, WDC announced its plan to acquire SanDisk at $20b. SanDisk is the world's third largest manufacturers of flash SSD memory with 11% market share. WDC is paying $67.5 cash plus 0.2387 share of WDC per share of SNDK, valuing SNDK at $79 as of 3/29/2016. This deal, approved by shareholders on 3/17/2016, is met with many criticisms quoting a high closing multiple of 35x trailing P/E (about 24x 1-year fwd P/E) on SNDK. Previously, Tsinghua Unispendour group planned to invest $3.8b for 15% stake in WDC in September 2015, but withdrew its plan due to Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States' (CFIUS) intention to investigate the deal.Extremely cheap relative to peers and by historical standardsMarket has penalized Western Digital to the extreme. Western Digital has lost 60% of its market cap since 1/2/2015 (Exhibit 1) and 40% since 10/21/2015 (Exhibit 2). January 2015 supposedly marked the recent peak of the hard disk drive (HDD) industry and the broader personal computing devices segment. On 10/21/2015, Western Digital announced its pricey acquisition of SanDisk. In both trailing periods, WDC performed much worse than peers.Exhibit 1. Stock performance vs. peers since 1/2/2015 (Google Finance)Exhibit 2. Stock performance vs. peers since 10/21/2015 (Google Finance)As shown in Exhibit 3, Western Digital trades at 30% to 50% discount to peers on EV/S, P/E and EV/EBITDA. This huge valuation gap does not jive with the fact that WDC's return on capital and growth of EBITDA, both in high single digits, come close to the high end of industry peers (highlighted in yellow in Exhibit 3). Exhibit 4 further shows that WDC's valuation multiples are near historical lows; the stock rallied over 100% in the following 24 months since the last two valuation bottoms (12/2008, 9/2011, Exhibit 5).Exhibit 3. Peer MultiplesExhibit 4. Trailing and Forward-looking Multiplies over Past 10 YearsExhibit 5. WDC's Performance Since Historical Lows as of 2/19/2016 (Google Finance)The reason behind the distress level valuation is simple: investors worry that hard drive industry will be obsolete in a decade or sooner and that, out of a desperate attempt to branch into flash SSD space, Western Digital may have grossly overpaid in its acquisition of SanDisk. I think both perceptions are more likely to be wrong. HDD is not going to be obsolete. Accretive or not, the SNDK deal makes strategic sense.The HDD industry is not going obsolete, thanks to product differentiations and rationalized industry oligopolyData storage products can be largely divided into three main product types: HDD, DRAM SSD, and NAND SSD. Each product type differs enough in its own value proposition that the cross-product type competition is more influenced by demand differentiation as opposed to pure price. Exhibit 6 details price vs. performance attributes of different product types.Exhibit 6. Price vs. Performance of Different Hardware StoragesSource: IMEX ResearchOn the supply side, SSD has been taking shares away from HDD, mainly by attracting marginal buyers that are price-sensitive and securing smartphones and tablets manufacturers that have to use flash on their devices in order to save power and decrease device size. Exhibit 7 shows the cross-over price point per gigabyte from HDD to SSD for the next few years. However, according to McKinsey's report (Page 36), the decrease in storage cost will slow down due to increasing technological challenges as node size shrinks on the single layer of chips to as small as 10 nanometers. This is why Micron and Intel are partnering up to develop 3D NAND that stacks up a dozen layers of chips. To some extent, 3D is just a fancy way to describe the fact that manufacturers are adding a layer when they can only fit so many cells on a single layer.Exhibit 7. Detailed Storage Price Comparison of HDD vs. SSD.Source: Market Realist.Speaking of demand, the customer base for hard drives has greatly diversified over past few years. PC segment used to be the main type of customer a decade ago. Nowadays, PC-driven demands only account for 59% of shipments, while the rest are split between smartphone/tablets and enterprise clouds. These customers have different preferences to price vs. performance, depending on how hard drives are used in each scenario. In short, smartphone and tablets manufacturers prefer performance to price, as they need to design smaller, thinner gadgets that are more power efficient. Enterprise users take all three attributes (performance, price and endurance) into account, depending on the type of data and software they are hosting. Low-cost drives are good for storing data that is not frequently accessed, but has to be archived for compliance reasons. Data tables that are frequently accessed should be stored on SSD products that afford fastest I/O cycles so that access to such data does not become a bottleneck for system operations. Many hybrid or public cloud companies adopt a tiered storage approach that uses faster drives for balancing servers and cheaper drives for regular data storage. At the end of the day, as storage cost lowers for SSD, SSD will continue to take shares away from HDD, but not as fast as people may expect.In addition, both SSD and HDD segments have grown through waves of consolidations to form an oligopolistic industry structure (Exhibit 8, 9, and 10). As demands are differentiated and supplies are consolidated, price and capacity competitions are going to be more rational than before. This should provide support on the part of WDC's margin that is susceptible to competitions.Exhibit 8. Industry Consolidation for DRAM and NANDSource: McKinsey industry report January 2016.

Industry Consolidation for HDDSource: ""How Three Hard Drive Companies Gobbled Up The Industry."" Russell Brandom.The SNDK acquisition is pricey but not deadly wrongFirstly, some investors categorically dismiss M&As, citing ample examples of M&A failures in history. However, there is no shortage of successful M&As and well-run serial acquirers, such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) in the technology industry. This is because successful acquisition strategy in tech is not to buy the best product in the market, but to buy the best capability of developing the next best product. McKinsey's research shows that, in the semiconductors industry, companies with frequent M&As over the past decade actually delivered better total returns to shareholders.WDC could benefit from SNDK merger in two ways: strategy and synergy.Strategy: this deal expands WDC's product portfolio and broadens its customer base. It also helps net out cannibalization between HDD and SSD and grow WDC's market share in both. With 11% market share, SNDK is one of the biggest players in the NAND flash market and has a portfolio of important flash NAND patents. Storage Search, a research website that focuses on SSD, applauds that SNDK truly understands enterprise market. According to FPA Capital, who held WDC as of last quarter, acquiring SNDK could help WDC to grow its enterprise SSD sales, currently estimated at $1bn. Their commentary mentioned that enterprise SSD could triple in size in five years, and if WDC integrates with SNDK successfully, WDC could stand to gain significant market shares in this fast-growing segment.Synergy: The synergy is estimated to be between $350m and $1.1bn per year by a few sell-side or buy-side sources (Exhibit 11). My synergy estimate is detailed in Exhibit 12. In short, I recognize that the incremental increase in revenue is modest (2% of combined revenue) but the savings in reduction of COGS and SG&A could be substantial, as much as 5% of combined pre-synergy costs. With a phase-in factor from 50% in year 1 to 100% to year 3, this translates into a present value of $12.54 per share.Exhibit 11. Synergy Estimates - Third Party SourcesExhibit 12. Synergy Estimate - My ModelAccretion/Dilution of Earnings: while few analysts explicitly conclude no synergy, the typical bearish argument is that the synergy is not enough to make the deal accretive due to an increase in debt expenses. The debt leverage, in itself, is not too worrisome, as post-merger debt/EBITDA multiple of 2.7x is manageable; I have also verified this in a complete M&A model (summarized in Exhibit 15). WDC's $10bn debt issuances are getting positive coverage from Moody and Fitch. My sensitivity analysis in Exhibit 14 indicates that, in order to break-even by 2017 in terms of EPS, the post-merger company needs to realize at least 1%-2% of incremental increase in combined revenue and cut at least 5% of combined costs. However, this is not a high hurdle rate to achieve, given the overlap of customer base and production process between WDC and SNDK. Lastly, Exhibit 3 shows that the post-merger multiple based on the current market price still offers a healthy discount to peers, albeit smaller in magnitude compared to the standalone valuation. This means that, even after adjusting for leverage, market is still overly pessimistic about the prospects of the deal.Exhibit 13. Sensitivity Analysis of Accretion/Dilution of 2017 EPS and PV of Synergy based on My M&A ModelValuation Exhibit 14 shows the valuation summary for base case (target price: $74, 53% upside) and bear case ($30, 37% downside). The target price is estimated on a standalone basis, but Exhibit 3 shows the post-merger valuation multiple implied from the price target. In short, for base case, I'm projecting on-par EBITDAs for 2016 and 2017; I'm confident that WDC could easily surprise on the upside. The $74 price target is calculated by applying a 5.5x EV/EBITDA pre-merger multiple, which is below the median multiple of the pure analogs to WDC shown in Exhibit 3. The post-merger multiple implied at the target price of $74 is also below the median/mean of the peer group. What is more, the FCFF yield at target price is 10%, down from 15% at current price. On the contrary, Seagate, WDC's biggest rival in HDD, is offering FCFF yield of 11%. I'm confident that my bear case scenario captures bad surprises to the full extent, with a 15% projected y-o-y drop in EBITDA in 2016 and 2017 and a recession-level multiple of 2x and 1.8x EBITDA.Exhibit 14. Valuation - Base and Bear CaseExhibit 15. Merger Model SummaryRisks1. The semiconductor industry may continue to decline. SSDs, HDDs and flash memory are mainly used in PCs and smartphones markets that are near saturation and exhibiting a downward trend in terms of HDD shipments (Exhibit 16 a, b). Decline industry demand will heighten competition and pressure margins. Margin compression due to operational deleverage could be a significant risk to the company.Exhibit 16 a and b.

Alken Asset Management, one of the top 10 shareholders of WDC, argues against the deal, quoting headwinds SNDK is facing and the increase in leverage. In addition, the firm believes that vertical integration synergies are not certain and obvious on WDC, and the M&A strategy is not convincing.3. There could be technology breakthroughs that would obsolete WDC's and SNDK's products, such as Micron's (MU) 3D NAND with Intel (INTC). However, sales of 3D NAND will be modest in 2016, as mentioned in this Seeking Alpha article. Other sorts of technology breakthroughs could still occur.4. Key client risk of HP and HP Enterprise.

Finally, a lone service rep placed eighth, Viacom B (NASDAQ:VIAB) [8], and completed the top ten NASDAQ 100 dogs by yield for March.NASDAQ Dividend vs. Price Results Shadowed Those Of Dow DogsTop ten NASDAQ 100 dogs compared to those of the Dow by yield 3/18/2016. Annual dividend projected from $10,000 invested as $1K in each of the ten highest yielding stocks and total single share price of those ten stocks created the data points shown in green for price and blue for dividend.Actionable Conclusions: (1) NASDAQ 100 Dogs Charged And(2) Dow Dogs Did Too After FebruaryNASDAQ 100 top ten dividend payers crossed over to the overbought zone as they declined in dividend and inclined in price after February. Aggregate single share price arose 5.7% to rise above the track of aggregate dividend from $10k invested, which fell 8% to confirm the bullish charge.Dow dogs also charged to widen their overbought condition. Aggregate single share price for the ten soared 16% between February 22 and March 18, while annual dividend from $10k invested as $1K in each of the top ten dropped 6% according to IndexArb.As mentioned, the Dow dogs overbought condition (where aggregate single share price of the ten exceeded projected annual dividend from $10k invested as $1k each in those ten) expanded after February.Actionable Conclusion (3): Dow Dogs Get Way OverboughtThe overhang was $291 or 79% for April; widened to $320 or 90% to begin May; soared to the new record $406 or 112% in June. The Dow bubble deflated as Dupont replaced IBM in the ten slot of the top ten for July to peg the gap at $269 or 71%, then inflated again as IBM replaced Pfizer to widen the gap to $331 or 85% for August. September brought some sanity back to the runaway Dow when the gap stood at $279 or 67%. October increases in price by CVX and XOM pushed the gap to $334 or 85%. November changed out MCD for WMT, and GE for KO. The resulting price over dividend gap went to $303 or 78%.As of December 8 the gap stood at $292 or 75%. Come January 20, Boeing moved up to the ten so price of the ten Dow top dogs swelled, and dividend shrank, to push the overbought gap back up to $351 or 91.5%. The influx of CSCO and INTC technology pushed consumer goods stalwarts P&G and KO out of the top ten to shrink the gap to $270 or 66% as of February 22. However, P&G reclaimed slot ten in March to join big dogs IBM and Boeing to put the gap to an record of $402 or 105%.This gap between high share price and low dividend per $1k invested defines the Dow over-bought condition. Meaning these are low risk and low opportunity Dow dog stocks. The Dow top ten average price per dollar of annual dividend was $26.41.Shadowing the DOW the NASDAQ ten, tracked into overbought territory. The value of dividends from $1k investments in each fell below the aggregate single share price of those stocks. The NASDAQ dog chart showed how normal could be achieved. (Notice the double crossing points in July and now in March where dividends moved above price in July and back below again this month ) The NASDAQ top ten average price per dollar of annual dividend was $25.58 as of March 18.NASDAQ Dogs UpsideResults from IndexArb.com tallied for 47 NASDAQ 100 Index members paying dividends as of market closing prices March 18, 2016 were stacked against analyst mean target price projections one year out. The results led to the actionable conclusions continuing below.Actionable Conclusions: (4) 10 Top NASDAQ 100 Dogs Displayed 22.48% Average Upsides Per Analyst Target Guesses For March 2017. (5) Four NASDAQ Pups Were also Found To Average 10% DownsidesActionable Conclusion (6): Wall St. Wizards Cast An 8.66% Average 1 yr. Upside & (7) A 9.25% Average Net Gain for Top 30 NASDAQ 100 Dogs To March 18, 2017Top 30 dogs on the NASDAQ 100 index stock list graphed below showed relative strengths by dividend and price as of March 18, 2016 and those projected by analyst median price target estimates to the same date in 2017.A hypothetical $1000 investment in each equity was divided by the current share price to find the number of shares purchased. The number of shares was then multiplied by projected annual dividend amounts to find the dividend return. Thereafter the analyst mean target price was used to gauge each stock's upside to 2017.Historic prices and actual dividends paid from $1000 invested in each of the highest yielding stocks and the aggregate single share prices of those thirty stocks divided by 3 created the data points for 2016. Projections based on estimated increases in dividend amounts from $1000 invested in the thirty highest yielding stocks and aggregate one-year analyst target share prices from Yahoo Finance divided by 3 created the 2017 data points on the chart below: green for price and blue for dividend.Yahoo reported Thomson/First Call analyst survey numbers predicted a 7.4% lower dividend from $10K invested as $1k in the average ten of this group, while aggregate single share price of those ten was predicted to increase 12.4% in the coming year. Notice that the 2016-17 graph shows price above dividend. Apparently analysts believe the Dow overbought condition will remain the NASDAQ 100 into 2017.Actionable Conclusion (8): Analysts Asserted 10 NASDAQ 100 Dividend Dogs Would Net 16.97% to 34.88% By March 2017Three of the top ten dividend yielding NASDAQ 100 dogs were detected among the top ten gainers for the coming year based on analyst 1 year target prices.

3959865,67113,2016-03-21T08:10:20-04:00,The SanDisk-Western Digital merger has received the green light. Western Digital could easily bounce back to $60+ per share pretty quickly.The growth is the solid state drives market will provide a nice tailwind.Cost synergies are expected to surpass $1 billion by 2020.We are buying 100 shares of Western Digital today.,"Shares of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) rallied above $49 a share on Friday the 18th of March as momentum seems to be gathering from the $17 billion merger with SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) which was approved recently. Western Digital will end up paying $67.50 per share in cash and 0.2387 shares of Western Digital stock per share of SanDisk stock. So will the merger work, is the question on everyone's mind. I believe it can and Western Digital has more upside in my opinion for a few reasons.Firstly look at where the share price has been over the last 12 months. In January of 2015, the stock topped out at $110 a share and just last October traded at $86 a share. (see chart)There were a few reasons why the share price collapsed so much in recent months. Firstly the share price dropped sharply on the 22nd of February when Western Digital announced that the Chinese firm Unisplendour was pulling out of its intended 15% stake in the former. The Chinese outfit pulled out probably because it would have been investigated thoroughly (Committee on Foreign Investment in the US) although net incomes levels from both companies (Western Digital & SanDisk) were down by around 40% in their respective fourth quarters on a rolling basis so this also could have been the reason.Then you had a strong Western Digital shareholder (Alken Asset Management) opposing the deal which again gave way to negative attention and share price losses before the deal. In fact after shareholder approval on the 15th of this month, Western Digital stock continued to drop until it finally found a bottom the following day as a result of merger synergies being made known. I believe the uptrend in the stock will continue for the following reasons.Firstly Western Digital shareholders will know that the hard disk drive market has been under serious pressure recently as falling prices in solid state drives is resulting in them being installed more and more in laptops. The SanDisk merger is beneficial here in that Western Digital can seriously leverage the present growth in SSD (solid-state drives) which should be reflected in its earnings after the deal goes through in earnest in the Summer.However cost synergies is where Western Digital can really make an impact long term especially in the enterprise storage market. In fact the company believes that cost synergies can surpass $1 billion by 2020 which would surely take away market share from the likes of Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Samsung especially if SanDisk's 3D technology can compete with competitors.In terms of valuation, the huge drop in the share price has the stock trading with a present earnings multiple of 10.11. When evaluating value plays, I also look at price to book ratio (1.19), price to sales ratio (0.9) and price to cash flow (5.0) which are all well below the company's 5 year averages. Furthermore the stock pays out more than a 4% dividend yield and has a very low present debt to equity ratio of 0.22. This will change as Western Digital will need to raise $10 billion in new debt to fund the cash portion of the deal (see chart). However I don't see debt becoming a problem considering that SanDisk has over $4 billion in cash on its balance sheet and plenty of equity for the merger to absorb the impending new debt.Source : Company SEC FilingsTo sum up, this stock is ticking all the boxes as an attractive value play at the moment. Hard drive demand isn't going anywhere any time soon as emerging markets should drive the next phase of the technology boom. Furthermore because this industry has seen huge consolidation over the past 8 to 10 years (which has meant that only 3 companies literally control the market), prices should remain elevated which will support Western Digital's margins. The merger with SanDisk will enable Western Digital take advantage of the current tailwind in SSD and flash memory which are definitely gaining traction in the industry at the moment.We are now approaching being almost 10% up on our portfolio. Once we get it to between $180 and $200k, Im pretty confident we can earn $20,000 annually from those levels. I'm going to be adding a few good dividend and growth stocks to the elevation portfolio over the next several weeks when I see value. It's imperative that they are not correlated and all don't have similar valuations to ensure that income is brought in every month, which, over time, will increase our share count. Follow along by pressing the ""Follow"" button above.Action Today: Buy 100 shares of WDC. Let's see how quick we can get this to $20k in annual income."
3956650,22263,2016-03-08T11:32:48-05:00,"My previous article published last month, “Western Digital Shareholders: Veto SanDisk deal and Watch Shares Leap” detailed why the deal was a classic case of value destruction.WDC Management were attempting to secure their tenure (to create a media-agnostic digital storage company, but why I ask) at the expense of shareholders who footed the bill!The folly of this deal is already evident to a top ten WDC holder; Alken Asset Management, who have publicly articulated their veto.The situation is confounded by shareholders who own both SNDK and WDC. SNDK will undergo a severe haircut if the deal is vetoed.This article attempts to forecast the cast of the vote with the shareholder landscape in mind.","My previous article details how Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) value has been halved by the prospects of the SNDK buyout. From it I extract the key argument, the value of WDC as a standalone entity adjusted for today's prices (WDC has risen by 22% since my article of 16 Feb).There is ample detail in the Alken Asset Management letter illustrating why the rationale of this deal is entirely unconvincing. I will emphasize one key point. WDC is already the third largest global NAND flash player due to a string of recent acquisitions. As Per Alken, ""The majority of the Transaction synergies are expected to come from vertical integration, allowing Western Digital to purchase NAND at a better price for its enterprise solid state drive business (7% of Western Digital 2015 revenues).To achieve vertical integration on a relatively small part of its business, we believe that Western Digital is paying an acquisition premium on the entire SanDisk business, which consists overwhelmingly of revenues unrelated to enterprise solid state drives (such as NAND for smartphone, PC, memory card, etc.) and where we anticipate few, if any, synergies.""So the question begs asking: Why in the world would WDC shareholders vote to buy SNDK - worth about twice WDC's current value when it would permit cost synergies on merely 7% of its business. It sure defies logic and it would be an extremely expensive luxury.Yet the lay of the land is not flat. Reason is compromised by the shareholders who own both WDC and SNDK. If the deal is vetoed, SNDK is going to fall below the current deal price of $78. So WDC shareholders who also own SNDK might be inclined to vote ""YES"", to avoid a grave haircut to SNDK's price.Now to the central thrust of the article. How will the vote be cast? Well for starters, the proxy firm ISS has already endorsed the deal, and most index funds holding the stock will go along. The next step is to examine the value owned by institutions who own both WDC and SNDK (at the most recent date available which is 31/12/15. Note the vote register will be taken for WDC shareholders on Feb 3, so this is probably quite accurate).If an institution has substantially more capital in WDC, reason suggests it would still vote ""NO"". For example Fidelity Management Research has $655m of capital in WDC. It also has $435m in SNDK, both at today's prices. IF they veto the deal, I believe WDC rises by at least 25%, but SNDK falls by 20%- these are my underlying assumptions in the table below. So what is the net effect of the above movement? FMR's WDC exposure rises by $164m, but their SNDK investment falls by $97m. As a result FMR should vote ""NO"". (This obviously presupposes that FMR is a collective voting entity - they may have greater vested interests in a specific fund in which WDC or SNDK shares are held. But there is no use deliberating that, we will never know.)However if a fund manager has more eggs vested in SNDK, it will vote for the deal, in order to avoid SNDK's collapse. For example Neuberger Berman has $372m in SNDK (see table below) and $96m in WDC. A ""NO"" vote would lead to a rise in WDC value of $29m and a fall in SNDK of $74.5m (based on WDC up 25%, SNDK down 20% on a veto). So clearly Neuberger Berman would vote ""YES"" to prevent the collapse of SNDK's value. See SNDK holdings below.After analyzing the shareholder landscape, a few salient points jump out:-Firstly the rules. A 50% veto will block the buyout. This is the watermark.-The WDC shareholder register is extremely diversified. The top ten WDC holders represent a mere 33% of the vote (cf SNDK = 44%), implying the vote will be decided by smaller 'rational' shareholders, most of which don't fall in the shareholder register of WDC. I would presume they are not big holders of SNDK, as this would have been revealed.-Index funds (Vanguard, State St et al) represent 15% of the vote, and I am assuming a ""YES"" on the SNDK buyout. There may be other index funds in the list that I have categorized wrongly. Please check and provide feedback.-Blackrock (total amongst their various filings) is a big factor in the decision. As far as the data suggests, they stand to gain $228m from a veto on WDC, losing $78m on SNDK. Blackrock (in their various forms) will vote ""NO""-I have assumed investment banks (Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan) will vote ""yes"" as they stand to earn enormous fees in the holding company if the deal is passed.-We have the top 40 Institutions that hold WDC, but we only have to top 10 that hold SNDK, as that data is not available on SNDK's website.Conclusion: As can be seen from the data, even if one assumes:-the index funds all vote ""YES"" in compliance with ISS-anyone who has a similar exposure to WDC and SNDK will vote ""Yes"" to prevent a slide in their SNDK value-the bankers who stand to gain M&A fees from the transaction approvalEven then, the die is far from cast. My analysis suggests that even with index, Hitachi and investment banker ""Yes"" votes, they are only guaranteed of 20% of the vote. Whereas shareholders who wish to see WDC catapult up by 25% on March 15th total 42%. Remember, a 50% ""NO"" will veto the deal. WDC shareholders, veto the deal and see your shares leap.Supporting Documents"

3872996,24663,2016-02-07T14:52:58-05:00,SNDK has essentially no downside in 2016 from this point forward.SNDK has upside of 6% in a worst-case scenario.SNDK could trade higher by nearly 30% in a best-case scenario.,"Hard disk drive makers Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) moved higher after recent earnings reports were better than analysts had expected. As a result of big dividends, lavish buybacks, and single-digit stock multiples, it is not surprising for investors gravitate to one or both stocks. While wise long term, the best way to preserve capital in a market such as this, while still achieving double-digit returns from your investment, is clearly to invest in SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK) as a storage play over either WDC or STX stock.SanDisk is a merger arbitrage play, with Western Digital announcing its $19 billion acquisition back in October of last year. The acquisition is expected to close later this year, and while some of the merger is being done via stock, it is mostly cash. That fact serves as a great downside hedge in what has become a volatile, nasty market.Basically there are two scenarios surrounding SNDK stock in 2016. If Western Digital is able to sell its 15% stake in China's Unisplendour then WDC will pay $85.10 per share in cash and 0.0176 shares of WDC stock to acquire SanDisk. If the sale of Unisplendour is blocked, Western Digital will pay $67.50 in cash and 0.2387 shares of WDC stock to complete the purchase of SanDisk.Personally, I expect the former to occur. Some investors are concerned after Philips had to cancel its $3.3 billion to sell an 80% stake in Lumiled's LED lighting business following regulatory scrutiny. There is a big difference in selling 80% of a large unit versus selling a minority stake of 15%. Nevertheless, the deal is mostly secured with cash.With SNDK stock trading at $69 it is just $1.5 short of Western Digital's worst-case scenario cash price if the Unisplendour divestment is prevented. With Western Digital having to pay 0.2387 shares in this scenario, it would value the SanDisk acquisition at $78.45 per share based on WDC's stock price at Friday's close. That is upside in SNDK stock of almost 14% this year.If Western Digital's divestment is allowed, the acquisition price of SNDK would be nearly $86 per share. That's upside of almost 25% for SNDK stock. So clearly, it favors SanDisk shareholders for Western Digital's sale of Unisplendour to work out. But regardless, SNDK stock owners will be just fine.Better than WDC, or STX?Given that the S&P 500 has already fallen 8% this year, it is not wise to bet on either WDC or STX stock despite the clear earning improvements, high yield and big buybacks. The reason is because both stocks are very volatile, and in down markets, both STX and WDC shares are probably going to underperform. WDC is 36% more volatile than the broader markets whereas STX is a whopping 145% more volatile. Therefore, it is dangerous to go long either WDC or STX.That said, if the market reverses and trades considerably higher from this point forward, both STX and WDC are likely to outperform, especially with a solid earnings report behind both companies. However, since WDC is paying for SNDK with some stock, it too will trade higher with WDC if the market reverses to shoot higher. Hence, SNDK does not have the downside risk of STX and WDC in a down market.All things considered, so long as the deal closes this year, there is really no scenario where SNDK is lower at the end of 2016 than right now. Currently, there is upside of 14% to 25%.Even if WDC stock falls 50% before the acquisition, then the SNDK purchase price will be between $73 and $85.50, upside of 6% to 24%.If WDC rises 50% before the acquisition, the SNDK purchase price will be between $86.3 and $87.55, an upside of 25% to 27%.Clearly, there are a lot of different scenarios, but none that make SNDK a particularly bad investment opportunity. Given the uncertainties surrounding the market, the relatively safe gains in SNDK stock are very appealing, much more than that of either STX or WDC."
3827746,25265,2016-01-22T10:47:56-05:00,Toshiba is a distant third in market share for hard disk drives and has lower margins than Seagate and Western Digital.Toshiba is reeling from an accounting scandal that could see it completely exit from the HDD business in 2016.This could provide a temporary boost to both Seagate and Western Digital.Both stocks should be sold on any strength as secular headwinds become stronger every quarter.,"There are only three players in the hard disk drive (HDD) market: Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY). Using information provided by both Seagate and Western Digital in their quarterly reports and International Data Corporation, we can parse out market share for each company.Each company's market share has been pretty static for the past few years, +/- 1.5 percentage points. On a revenue basis, Toshiba only garnered 13.8% market share in Q3 2015 according to IDC data.It is no secret that Toshiba is reeling from a major accounting scandal this year that saw the CEO and several senior officials resign. Profits were overstated by $1.2B over a seven-year period. The company is forecasting a massive loss this year, has cancelled its dividend and is financing its operations by raising billions in debt. I looked into Toshiba's product line-up in HDDs - particularly its enterprise offerings. It pales in comparison to Western Digital and Seagate's offerings. It shows up in the operating performance. Here is a chart compiled by Bloomberg of data put out by IDC.Toshiba generates a majority of its HDD revenue from drives used in laptops (57% for the most recent reported quarter). Incidentally these drives have the lowest margin and are the most likely to be displaced by NAND flash drives. In the category that generates the highest margin for these companies, enterprise drives, Toshiba is woefully lacking a competitive line-up. It has just 8.5% market share by revenues.So then the question becomes - why should Toshiba even bother remaining a distant third in the HDD space given its financial woes and the rapid adoption of NAND flash? Let's consider the numbers. Toshiba generated $4.0B in revenue selling HDDs over the last 12 months. Given its lack of competitive enterprise offerings, its gross margin is in the low 20s at best. I'd ballpark it at 22%. I'll be generous and estimate that its EBITDA margin is 12% and net income margin is 4%. I used Western Digital's consistent performance as a guide. Toshiba is not likely as well managed, so my numbers are likely generous. That means Toshiba generated roughly $160M in net income in the last year by operating this business. Operating cash flow could be closer to $210M given non-cash charges. However we know there are capital expenditure requirements. I estimate them to be ~3.5% of revenues (in-line with peers). That puts free cash flow at a measly $70M/year - and likely dropping. That says nothing of the amount of debt this business carries.So that begs the question: Why even bother? HDDs are a sun-setting industry. Within 5-10 years most of demand will have shifted to NAND or some other technology not yet commercialized. The company's net income is likely to erode further in the coming years as sales decline and margins compress. Toshiba's business is not at sufficient scale and its product offerings are too limited to generate meaningful income for its parent company. Further investment to boost sales does not make financial sense given the above dynamics.I'm not the only one wondering whether Toshiba should continue in this business. This article goes into some detail about Toshiba's woes and considers what businesses could be divested. HDDs is on the list. But is there a natural buyer of the business? I cannot think of one. Other conglomerates, Samsung and Hitachi, sold their businesses to Seagate and Western Digital, respectively. They don't want to get back into the business. Anyone buying the business will put a large discount on the price given Toshiba's poor market position. Maybe a private equity vulture would pay a couple million for it. Maybe a Chinese buyer emerges because they want the technology. But again, this technology could be worthless within the next decade, so why bother? If Toshiba shops it around and finds no buyers it could just shut the whole thing down rather than continue to invest precious dollars into old technology.From a regulatory standpoint, I don't think Seagate or Western Digital would even try to make a run at the business. Anti-competitive watchdogs don't like mergers that result in a duopoly. But what can they do about one that just happens naturally? If no one buys the business from Toshiba it could just go away, which would leave only two standing. But of course Seagate and Western Digital don't just compete against themselves. NAND flash is taking more and more of the digital storage market share from these companies every quarter. A progressive take on the storage market by regulators would not foresee a problem with a duopoly in HDDs.So what would that mean for Seagate and Western Digital in the near-term if Toshiba quit the HDD market? Each would likely garner about half of Toshiba's $4B in annual revenues. Assuming a 10 percent net margin that could add another $200M in annual income for each. Maybe each gains some marginal pricing power in the near term and margins expand. Any rally in either Seagate or Western Digital should likely be sold though. Longer-term Seagate is not well positioned for the transition to flash. Western Digital is buying SanDisk but there are no guarantees that will work either. The company is taking on ~$16B in additional debt to finance the transaction. Market observers generally point to Micron and Samsung as being the best positioned in the NAND space for the next five years.So in conclusion, Toshiba's HDD business is in nomad's land. As Toshiba seeks to restructure its business to focus on the most promising technologies, it hardly seems as though HDDs would have a place anymore. With no natural buyer of a distant third in terms of market share in a sun setting industry, Toshiba could just completely shut down operations. This would give both Seagate and Western Digital a temporary boost. Any strength in the share price as a result of a Toshiba exit from the space is likely a good point to reduce exposure to this space. The technology is moving rapidly. Flash makers are willing to endure low margins and high capex in order to gain market share. Price wars are never good for profit maximizing firms. The long-term pressure on margins for HDDs will continue.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Because of these problems, Western Digital has seen its financial prospects drop significantly since December 2014. However, on March 15th, 2016 WDC stockholders approved a merger between Western Digital and SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) for $18 billion with a shareholder approval rating of 90 percent. The terms of the buyout include $9 billion in term loans, $8 billion in bridge loans and $1 billion in credit. Western Digital has strategically bought SanDisk at a share price of $86.50 (with debt and long-term futures value added) in what we believe is a considerable discount to the future potential performance of the WDC/SNDK combined entity. By combining the financial statements of both companies and using conservative analyst expectations to forecast future cash flows of both companies, we have calculated that the combined entity currently trades at around 60% discount to its intrinsic price.Merger with SanDisk to unlock value in Chinese marketsThe major strategic value of the WDC/SNDK acquisition is that SanDisk has major influence in the East Asian market which has traditionally been hard for American storage and memory providers to compete profitably. Even though SanDisk holds only a 12% percent market share within the total flash memory and external hard drive markets, its value and technical ability exceeds that of its East Asian competitors. This acquisition will likely make Western Digital a powerhouse for storage needs that will now be able to meet both the Chinese and North American storage requirements. The main theory behind this acquisition is that Western Digital wants to compete with industrial chip makers such as Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Toshiba to provide cheaper NAND and SSD chips to the market place. Western Digital is likely to shape demand needs within East Asian consumers such as Apple and Samsung with high end mobile NAND storage and to possibly continue growth within emerging markets in South Asia and Southeast Asia, in countries such as Vietnam and India that have a growing mobile market.Western Digital strategically targeting purpose-based cloud systemsIt is not wrong to assume that in the near future storage will likely shift from solid state drives to personal cloud-based devices. Western Digital is trying to rapidly change course with its storage capabilities by enhancing its knowledge though the SanDisk acquisition and will likely use the NAND and SSD expertise from SanDisk for faster cloud-based mobile solutions. With this in mind, WDC will likely start to improve on its existing cloud-based products like ""My Cloud"" and network attachments to personal cloud-based systems such as its DL2100-DL4100 which is offered to businesses for unique cloud storage and management. The idea of personal cloud systems is a new idea and was solidified by IBM's (NYSE:IBM) forays in the mid-2000s. Western Digital sees this as an opportunity to tap a younger audience that uses more data drive devices as well as businesses that want to get off a subscription based model. These businesses want to save money and understand how to better utilize a more dynamic Cloud system.In addition, Western Digital acquired Amplidata for $267 million, which was in due to superior technical expertise with platform based software focused around personal cloud storage. Virident was recently acquired by Western Digital for $613 million. Both major purchases within the past year show an initiative to improve on existing cloud-based systems. As WDC focuses in on the cloud and related network products to drive future revenue, it looks to exceed market expectations with cloud servers by changing a decreasing solid state storage market with cost efficiency turning toward more dynamic cloud storage leading that way.Likely improvement in WDC financial positionWestern Digital/SanDisk combined revenue stream should total nearly $20 billion at the end of 2016 if the merger successfully is followed through. By summing the financial statements of both companies we have estimated how their combined entity would have performed in the past 10 years. While past performance is by no means guarantee of future performance, the model of the combined business does tell us something very interesting about the potential merger. As it is displayed in the graph below the volatility of earnings of the combined business is significantly smaller than the two entities alone. This is surprising to see in the intrinsically cyclical semiconductor/hardware space. Using low end analyst expectations to calculate the expected performance in the next two years we have found that return on invested capital will likely increase to 11.8% in 2016 versus 8.7% pre-merger. However, despite the expected improvement in returns, growth rates are still expected to remain low in the foreseeable future, even after the merger. We have calculated that the market currently expects organic asset growth of the two companies will remain close to 6.1%.Source: Produced by the author using public available informationFinally if we assume analyst expectations are roughly correct about the near future of these two companies, we can come up with a DCF valuation of the combined entity.Source: Produced by the author using public available informationNoteworthy Risks:Companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are tackling the demand for third-party storage for consumer and business related demand.In recent years there has been a phenomenon of tech companies buying out long-time industry competitors. This recent change hasn't gone unnoticed in the semiconductors or conjoining information technology fields. Data storage has been steadily growing around 7% percent a year, but the overall demand needed within the data storage industry is speculated to be around 50% percent annually of the current capacity for all major data storage companies. With such rapid growth, allocation has been mishandled by the major companies, allowing new competition to enter the market. And, with appealing barriers to entry we have begun to see companies like Google, Amazon and Apple tackle the demand for third-party storage for consumer and business related demand. With this new wave of competitors, private storage companies like Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), SanDisk, and EMC (EMC) have had no choice but to consolidate their company strategies to tackle such competitors. This was the case with the acquisition of EMC by Dell, and WDC's acquisition of SanDisk. Acquisitions within the data storage sector tend to pay out larger long term profits than some comparable technology industries because industry acquisitions do not seem to focus on expanding beyond their base business. Also, data storage acquirers are not likely to pay out huge sums for patents and technology that usually only have slightly above average return for the industry at considerable expense to the acquirer. However the technology gleaned from such mergers and acquisitions can be temporarily beneficial. The core of acquisition in the data storage industry seems to be far too focused on consolidating in order to simply stay in play rather than innovating and looking beyond conventional approaches. As the market seems to get smaller and smaller for such companies, the closing gap of more convenient companies like Google, Amazon and Apple will likely take large amount of market share away from Western Digital.Conclusion:The merger of Western Digital and SanDisk will both increase profit for the companies and meet long-term revenue goals while allowing the companies to expand into overseas operations in Asian markets, which have traditionally been unsuccessful for American-based semi/storage manufactures. Along with this merger we can see further value being added with flash based intellectual property and expertise that SanDisk has acquired over the years that will be hard to replicate and match by Asian competitors such as Samsung and Toshiba. Western Digital wants to change its approach by offering more unique and niche services for cloud-based storage which the company seems to be emphasizing at this time. This interest is likely to further develop as solid state drives become obsolete over the next 20 years. With the increasing global shift to cheap and potentially limitless cloud storage we can see that the service storage market has been significantly altered as of late by companies like Amazon, Google and Apple building their own server-based storage business to both reduce cost and improve customer efficiency. This is placing a premium on third-party cloud storage and solution based companies like Western Digital that are trying to improve profitability in these areas by offering unique and cheaper packages as an alternative to the bigger firms in order to win market share. With the constant consolidation of the storage companies in competition with wholly owned storage the computer storage industry will likely see tough years ahead of it but will undoubtedly prevail with the ever increasing trend of developing faster and more capable memory storage solution."

The stock is around 35 percent lower from the last time I warned about holding this company on October 24, 2015. Now trading near its yearly low, investors should continue avoiding storage makers like Western Digital.Storage a commodityWestern Digital is not the only firm whose profit margin is eroding.

The company expects a slight uptick in its gross margin percentage.Source: marketvis.ioUnfortunately, the demand for PCs, including laptops, remains a challenge. This will exert negative pressure on storage makers. Unless gaming computer sales improved during the holiday, Western Digital and Seagate will likely disappoint investors in their next quarterly report. Investors already are souring on PC makers. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) is down in the last month, although Western Digital fared worse in the last three months:WDC data by YChartsThree-month stock performance:WDC data by YChartsStorage suppliers do not benefit much from strong console sales, in which Sony (NYSE:SNE) boasted about selling 35 million units and ZDNet speculated on January 8 that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) sold 18 million Xbox One units. A higher sales mix from consoles hurts profit margins.Solid State Disks a bright spotFalling solid state disk prices (""SSDs"") should improve adoption for the faster type of storage. If Western Digital experiences an upward trend in sales for them, it might help offset the low profitability from hard disks. If enterprises implement SSDs having a higher average storage capacity, this too will help WDC's earnings. SSDs for embedded solutions, smartphones, tablets and Internet of Things also are sources for profitability growth for both Western Digital and Seagate.One downside for relying on SSD supplying for smartphones is that the sector is slowing. Gartner reported last August that sales fell the most since 2013. Sales for smartphones in China also declined.SanDisk to weigh on sharesAcquiring SanDisk will weaken Western Digital's balance sheet in the short term. Longer term, SanDisk strategically removes a competitor and deepens Western Digital's set of product offering. Still, management expected SanDisk would contribute positively to growth upfront, a view that's at risk of being wrong. Slow sales for smartphones, tablets and computers will make it challenging for SanDisk to meet growth expectations. This will hurt Western Digital's stock price.Investors should continue avoiding Western Digital, Seagate and PC makers like Hewlett-Packard."
3595506,51302,2015-10-22T17:25:16-04:00,The finalization of the Hitachi merger will benefit WDC.WDC paid a high premium for SNDK.WDC will need to greatly improve SNDK's profitability to make the acquisition worthwhile.,"IntroductionLast week I wrote an article arguing that it would be better for Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) not to buy SanDisk (SNDK). If you choose to read the article, be sure to go to the comments for some thoughtful counterpoints to my argument. This week WDC announced that it would buy SNDK and that the Chinese government has basically approved the Hitachi merger. With all the changes going on, I want to give some quick thoughts about WDC going forward.The New WDCLet's start with the good things first. WDC purchased SNDK for about $86.50 per share, with around $18 billion in cash financed by debt and a swap of .0176 shares of WDC for each share of SNDK. Though I am against this deal, I must say that shareholders are being diluted far less than I would have expected, given the size of this acquisition. Prior to the Unisplendor investment, WDC had 237 million shares (diluted). After Unisplendor's investment for 15% in equity, the total share count increased to around 278 million. SNDK's latest share count is around 206 million shares outstanding. At the ratio to trade SNDK shares for WDC shares, there should now be a total WDC share count of around 281 million shares; a 1.3% dilution. Again, that is not terrible considering the magnitude of this acquisition.Another bright spot is that the finalization of the Hitachi merger is, according to management, supposed to result in savings of around 400 - 600 million per year. The merger also gives WDC excellent access to the Chinese market. That market may be experiencing some major headwinds right now, but over the long term, WDC's growth will benefit from having operations in the country.The finalization of the Hitachi merger is undoubtedly a good thing for WDC, but I am not so sure about the SNDK acquisition. WDC used $18 billion in debt to purchase SNDK and, as of 3Q 2015, SNDK had a book value of about $5.6 billion. That is a lot of goodwill. I do not know what kind of interest rates WDC has to pay on its debt now, but in its most recent 10-K, WDC paid $45 million in interest on $2.1 billion in long term debt. So, I will assume they are paying 2% on the $18 billion. It is probably higher, given that treasury bonds are ranging from around 2- 3% for the 10 year and the 30 year, but I will assume 2% to be generous. Even at 2%, the interest payouts on what is now a total of $20 billion in debt will be around $400 million.For the three quarters in 2015, SNDK generated around $600 million in cash from operations. For the full year of 2015, it will probably make a little over $800 million. Compared to the potential $400 million in interest payments, that does not look too bad, but some items need to be deducted from that figure. First, CAPEX for the last three quarters is nearing $300 million; a marked rise over last year's CAPEX. At the current pace, the full year CAPEX will be $370 million. Also, operating income does not take into account share based compensation. That compensation is already totaling $120 million at current share prices; by year's end it could be above $150 million. Before you dismiss share compensation as not worth including, remember three things:Assuming a very low interest rate on the debt, assuming CAPEX amounts can be brought down significantly, and assuming that share based compensation will also be curbed, you get free cash flows, after interest payments, of $250 million. It will take a long time for WDC to pay off the principle of $18 billion with only $250 million in free cash flow. Perhaps, SanDisk will be able to grow its profits considerably now that it is merged with WDC, but I have doubts.SNDK's management sums up their dilemma in their 2Q 2015 report (page 46). They expect a major loss in revenue due to the loss of a significant client, also they expect their unit prices will decrease faster than costs, and finally, that they are behind their competitors in developing 3D NAND technology. If WDC can use its brand to bring back customers, if WDC can realize lower unit costs, and if WDC/SNDK's combined technical expertise will put them back into the technological lead, then operating cash flows will likely increase. However, those are some serious obstacles to overcome, especially with the competition in the NAND flash market.In summary, I believe that a lot of ""ifs"" have to be realized for this deal to benefit WDC given the price they paid. Perhaps, this was the best way for WDC to move beyond the HDD market, but for now, I am skeptical that shareholders came out ahead in this deal."
3592686,92916,2015-10-22T09:57:37-04:00,"Western Digital's acquisition of SanDisk is evidence of Western Digital's plans of becoming an SSD giant in the post-HDD world.Micron, Intel and Samsung are (likely) all building significant new capacity for 3D NAND that begins production in 2016 and 2017. Big demand for SSDs is coming soon.The HDD in 10 years will be what the floppy disk is today for young children - technology that will only be seen in history books (more like e-books).","With Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) now set to acquire NAND manufacturer SanDisk (SNDK), the foggy technology roadmap for Western Digital (and the HDD (Hard Disk Drive) in general) is starting to become clear. Sales at Western Digital and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) peaked in the 2012-13 timeframe and have since started to taper off by single-digit percentages annually. Talk of the ""death of the PC"" and by extension, ""death of the HDD,"" has been discussed for years. However, HDD sales at the two giants of the industry have only dipped a bit (pun intended) in the last two years. The era of a slow decline in HDD sales is coming to an end soon. If the NAND manufacturers are not wildly off in their predictions, HDD sales are about to experience enormous drops within 3 years.Western Digital's desire to acquire SanDisk is simple to understand - Western Digital needs to find a source of revenue in its post-HDD era. SanDisk is the cost leader in production of planar NAND flash, the NVM (non-volatile memory) that serves as the underlying technology that allows for the storage of data in SSDs (Solid State Drives). Relative to HDDs, SSDs are faster, more durable, weigh less and consume less power (and therefore emit less heat). In a nutshell, virtually all performance metrics of SSDs (that do not involve cost) are significantly better than those of HDDs. Unsurprisingly, everyone who has followed the storage industry knows with certainty that SSDs will eventually completely replace HDDs. The only question that remains is ""When will it happen""?I wrote an article in September that discusses the issue of when HDD sales will fall off a cliff. NAND manufacturers are building out their various versions of 3D NAND to increase the density of NAND dies, which equates to lowering the cost per bit. The NAND manufacturers plan to continuously lower the cost of NAND and get the price per GB of SSDs close to that of HDDs. While Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF), SanDisk (with Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY)) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) (with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)) have been working on lowering the cost of NAND, Western Digital and Seagate have been trying to delay the death of the HDD by also finding new ways to improve their technology (increase areal density) to lower the cost per GB of HDDs. The rate of decline in cost per bit for 3D NAND will be (significantly) higher than that of HDDs. With the estimates I used in the article, I estimated the big drop in HDD sales would occur sometime between late-2018 and early-2027.If Western Digital successfully acquires SanDisk, I believe the cliff dive of HDD sales will occur in the very early parts of my late-2018 to early-2027 range. The reason is simple: Western Digital will simply cut back its R&D expense to extend the life of the HDD roadmap and reallocate its resources to its SSD future. Western Digital has spent billions on R&D in the last few years to lower the cost per bit of HDDs, because it had no other options. With SanDisk, Western Digital now has a way to survive without spending money on R&D that has limited long-term value. The combined entity will bet their collective futures on the rapid growth of SSDs at the expense of its core HDD business. As a result, I expect the cost-per-bit decline of HDDs will slow even more than it has over the last few years, which will give an even better opportunity for SSD costs to come down to comparable levels. This should be a significant long-term positive for all of the NAND manufacturers.SanDisk is the cost leader in planar NAND, but I suspect it will quickly lose that lead as the industry moves towards 3D NAND. In 3D NAND, SanDisk's BiCS will (likely) initially cost more on a per-bit basis than Samsung's V-NAND (which will have gone through a few iterations of improvement by the time SanDisk is shipping its 3D NAND in high volume.) SanDisk will not only be trailing Samsung, but it will also be even further behind Micron and Intel in 3D NAND cost per bit, as the 32-layer 384 Gb TLC NAND of Micron/Intel will be the highest-density NAND solution in the market. With SanDisk seemingly dragging its feet in the conversion to 3D NAND, it would not be surprising for the duo of Micron and Intel to already be on its next iteration of 3D NAND that will only increase its density (and cost per bit) advantage over SanDisk even more.I strongly believe Samsung's $23 billion fab will use the vast majority of its new wafers to build 3D NAND. Wafers from this fab are supposed to start hitting the market as early as 2017. Micron is spending $4 billion to expand its Singapore fab for 3D NAND. Intel has announced that it will upgrade one of its fabs in China to also build 3D NAND. Micron's fab in Singapore and Intel's fab in China are expected to start shipping 3D NAND by the end of 2016. If Western Digital successfully acquires SanDisk, I would immediately expect the combined entity (perhaps with a friendly partner in China) to quickly plan on building new capacity (with or without Toshiba) to increase its production of 3D NAND wafers to help facilitate Western Digital's conversion from its HDD past to its SSD future. I would not be surprised if this new capacity expansion is of the megafab (Samsung-like) variety as all of the potential 3D NAND bit capacity of SanDisk is just a tiny fraction of the bit demand for Western Digital HDDs.I want to address the news of Intel expanding its 3D NAND capacity in China separately from Micron, its partner in NVM. In a Seeking Alpha article published less than three weeks ago titled, Micron: 2016 and Beyond, I wrote:With regards to 3D NAND, my assessment that an Intel expansion is evidence of significant future demand has not changed. Of course, Micron would prefer if it had a stake right now in this Chinese fab that Intel will use to build more 3D NAND wafers. This news of Intel's expansion is (slightly) disappointing to me as a Micron investor, because NAND capacity is going to increase possibly without Micron getting a cut of the profits from this expansion (initially). However, according to this article on the StreetInsider, Micron may ""participate in Intel's China plant more in the future. The company's joint fab strategy with Intel provides flexibility.""On Twitter, @MicronTech posted:Doug Freedman of Sterne Agee has also weighed in on the news of Intel's Chinese expansion. The Sterne Agee report states, ""We believe the new investment target has been discussed by both INTC and MU, thus indicating both companies confidence in 3D NAND and Xpoint - a new memory technology developed by the JV."" The above-linked article at Benzinga further states:Intel working with Micron in China seems like a strong possibility in the future. The path to enormous profits in NVM is clear for both parties right now. I don't think either is willing to attempt a big market share grab at the expense of the other, if such a move would jeopardize this incredibly fruitful relationship. I strongly believe the demand picture is so bright for 3D NAND and XPoint over the next decade that Micron shareholders will still be rewarded handsomely to the tune of well over $40/share by 2018.Given the timeline of when I expect Intel, Micron and Samsung (along with my assumption of a massive increase in SanDisk's 3D NAND capacity, if it is acquired by Western Digital) to start massively increasing the world's supply of 3D NAND, it is obvious that the giants of non-volatile memory are making big bets on significant increases in demand over an extended period of time starting in 2017. Wall Street analysts seem to be viewing NAND capacity and HDD capacity as two distinct markets. I believe current estimates of NAND demand by most analysts significantly underestimates the long-term growth potential of 3D NAND (and XPoint and other future next generation NVMs) because they are not making bold predictions of the growth of SSDS at the expense of HDDs. Western Digital's acquisition of SanDisk will only further speed up the already aggressive estimates that the major NAND manufacturers are projecting internally.Today, most 10-year old children have never seen the objects in the image below:(click to enlarge)Most children born today (or later) will likely see the image below in a decade and have the same response as 10-year olds today have when they see the image of the floppy disks above.The six-member storage oligopoly of Western Digital, SanDisk, Samsung, SK Hynix, SanDisk (with Toshiba) and Micron (with Intel) will be reduced to five if Western Digital acquires SanDisk. I firmly expect the landscape of the industry (in terms of market share) to be vastly different in five years than it is today. I see the new Western Digital-SanDisk and Seagate as the laggards of the industry in terms of their technology roadmap. In fact, I would expect both the new Western Digital-SanDisk and Seagate to both be worth significantly less than Micron when the fog clears. For now, my only bet here is on Micron, but the short thesis on Western Digital is starting to get significantly more attractive."

PMC-Sierra (NASDAQ:PMCS) finds itself in a bidding war between Microsemi Corporation (NASDAQ:MSCC) and Skyworks (NASDAQ:SWKS). I just don't see a similar bidding war emerging for SanDisk.Micron and Western Digital were rumored to be in discussions to acquire SanDisk for the last few weeks. While a Micron acquisition of SanDisk would eliminate a member of the NAND oligopoly and bring about a higher concentration of power in the industry, Micron's main benefit from acquiring SanDisk would be SanDisk's joint fab capacity that it shares with Toshiba. SanDisk would get to abandon its effort with Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) to jointly develop a next generation NVM (non-volatile memory) that will try to match the performance characteristics of Micron and Intel's 3D XPoint. A Micron-SanDisk combination could also abandon the expensive effort to roll out SanDisk's BiCS. Assuming a deal is mostly financed in cash, Micron would also likely see a short-term boost in earnings and free cash flow.While SanDisk's fab capacity would be nice to have for Micron, SanDisk's IP (intellectual property) is unlikely to be of significant value to Micron. Micron seems to be pleased with its 3D NAND solution and 3D XPoint, which would indicate that the Idaho-based memory giant would likely just scrap SanDisk's R&D efforts in 3D NAND and next generation NVM. SanDisk's planar NAND has significantly better cost per bit metrics than that of Micron's planar NAND, but the era of 3D NAND is quickly approaching. Micron is set to leapfrog SanDisk (as well as SK Hynix and Samsung) to reach the top of the list of companies in terms of cost per bit for NAND by the end of 2016 (or early 2017).On top of the lack of significant value that Micron sees in SanDisk's IP, Micron would also likely have to deal with the objections of regulatory agencies in the US (DOJ and FTC) and abroad, which would add delays and additional costs that a Western Digital-SanDisk tie up may be able to avoid. SanDisk shares fabs with Toshiba and it seems highly unlikely that Micron would be willing to share its 3D NAND (and 3D XPoint) architecture with rival Toshiba. It also seems unlikely that Toshiba would want to share its IP with Micron (and Intel) too. The only way to avoid this would be either Micron or Intel also acquiring Toshiba concurrently with a Micron-SanDisk merger. A Micron-SanDisk merger would already be complicated as is. Another deal with Toshiba would just compound the difficulties of getting a deal through (for financial, technological and regulatory reasons).Western Digital highly values SanDisk's IP and fab capacity. With Micron subtracting out the value of SanDisk's IP, adding costs related to delays resulting from regulatory activity, adding a premium relative to Western Digital's big bid and potentially lowering future gross margins due to sharing IP with Toshiba, Micron would have to value SanDisk's fab capacity at significantly more than $19 billion. There is also the sticky issue of having to get Toshiba and Intel to not vehemently protest, which seems unlikely to me. As a result, I believe there is close to no chance that Micron will present a bid that is better than what Western Digital has offered.Samsung made a $5.8 billion bid for SanDisk in 2008 and subsequently pulled the offer. Unlike Micron, there's a chance that Samsung can find value in both SanDisk's fabs and IP. Currently, Samsung is paying royalties to SanDisk for use of SanDisk's NAND patents. This cost could be eliminated with a SanDisk acquisition. Samsung is likely experiencing significant problems with its 3D NAND product that it has been shipping for over a year already. In the event that Samsung cannot cost effectively fix their issues with V-NAND, the Korean electronics giant could scrap its 3D NAND architecture and join SanDisk and Toshiba with BiCS. On the R&D side, it is highly probable that both Samsung and SanDisk are both hard at work on trying to find a response to Micron and Intel's 3D XPoint as soon as possible. By merging, the two NAND giants could focus their collective efforts on one next generation NVM architecture, which could lead to both shortening the time it takes to develop a next generation NVM as well as a potential huge cost savings of not having to run two separate development efforts.For unknown reasons, the 2008 bid from Samsung for SanDisk appeared to have led to minimal dialogue between the two. Samsung pulled its offer because of ""SanDisk's refusal to entertain friendly discussions."" SanDisk stated that it was Samsung who was uninterested to begin discussions on a possible merger. SanDisk also stated, ""We believe this raises questions about the real motivation behind Samsung's offer."" Whatever prevented even holding discussions in 2008 seems to present the possibility that a repeat in 2015 could occur even if Samsung and SanDisk were interested in a possible deal. The regulatory issues a Micron-SanDisk deal would have would only be magnified for a possible Samsung-SanDisk merger. While a Samsung-SanDisk deal offers more synergistic value than a Micron-SanDisk deal, the odds of a big Samsung offer for SanDisk now seem remote at best.An SK Hynix deal for SanDisk makes a lot more sense than a Samsung or Micron bid. Hynix has the weakest position in NAND of the major manufacturers and SanDisk currently has the strongest. Since SanDisk does not produce DRAM and Hynix is one of the big three in manufacturing DRAM, a single entity consisting of SK Hynix and SanDisk could make a very cost-competitive MCP (Multi Chip Package) consisting of mobile DRAM and NAND for the smartphone market. Seventy percent of mobile phones will have MCPs this year. As separate entities, SK Hynix and SanDisk would face significant risk of not being able to produce competitively-priced MCPs once Micron ramps up production of its low cost 3D NAND. Hynix's ability to scrap its own 3D NAND and next generation NVM development in favor of SanDisk's current NVM architectures would present significant cost savings. Risk of regulatory interference exists, but it is significantly less than that of potential bids from Micron or Samsung.In the comments section of my previous article, ""SanDisk: The Acquisition Target,"" the issue of Toshiba (SanDisk's fab partner in producing NAND) having trouble working with a Korean company was thoroughly discussed. While Japanese-Korean relations may not be ideal, I do not think it would be a major issue that would prevent a deal so long as the financial terms of the deal makes sense for everyone involved. While I see an SK Hynix bid as far more likely than a Samsung or Micron bid, it is hard to fathom the possibility of SK Hynix putting in an offer higher than $19 billion.Seagate would love nothing more than to drive up the price of SanDisk for Western Digital. Western Digital is going to become very highly leveraged if it must pay close to $19 billion in cash to close the deal. The combined Western Digital-SanDisk would create a company that initially has a negative tangible book value after Western Digital borrows up to $18.4 billion to finance this transaction. Seagate is already a more highly levered firm than Western Digital, and it seems unlikely that Seagate would be willing to become as insanely highly levered as it would have to be to create a compelling offer for SanDisk shareholders. Seagate would get the same benefits as Western Digital would with an acquisition of a giant NAND manufacturer, an ability to transition to a major SSD manufacturer in the post-HDD era (whenever that happens). However, a bid in excess of $19 billion would be difficult to pull off. Western Digital has a cleaner balance sheet than Seagate and also has a Chinese friend that may potentially be involved in financing the bid for SanDisk. Seagate does not have that luxury and will likely be unable to offer a significant premium over the mostly cash bid from its long-time arch-rival.There are some potential benefits for Apple if it is able to successfully acquire SanDisk. The memory industry is cyclical and prices of NAND can (and will) fluctuate significantly over time. While predicting the costs of producing NAND is fairly easy to do for a NAND producer, estimating the trajectory of the price per GB of NAND has been extremely difficult for everyone. As a result of a SanDisk acquisition, Apple could get some cost certainty (and more importantly supply guarantee) in a critical storage component in its iPhone, iPad and whatever electronic devices that the company will dream up in the future.The above chart represents SanDisk's revenues by segment. (The numbers don't add up to 100% always due to rounding. These numbers were pulled directly from SanDisk's quarterly filing in July.) It becomes pretty obvious that SanDisk's mix of end market demand for its NAND does not even remotely resemble the mix of end markets of Apple products that require NAND. It is important to note NAND is not just one type of memory product. There are actually several subcategories of products (under the NAND umbrella) including SLC, MLC and TLC as well as modifications to that NAND to suit the various end products the memory dies will end up in (USB flash drives, memory cards, SSDs. etc.) While close to all of SanDisk's revenue comes from selling NAND (if you ignore royalties), this revenue is actually derived from many separate products that are not interchangeable.Certainly, Apple could modify the mix of SanDisk's output to more closely match the needs of its iDevices. That will take time. However, it is inevitable that Apple will have to continue selling NAND-based products to other electronics companies as well as directly to consumers. Apple (with its new partner Toshiba) will become the fourth NAND giant. Unlike a possible Micron acquisition of SanDisk, an Apple acquisition of SanDisk is unlikely to draw objections from SanDisk's joint venture partner Toshiba.Apple's relationship with Samsung has been strained for many years now. While Apple's smartphones, tablets and Macs compete directly with Samsung's versions of those products, Samsung has been a supplier of critical components of these Apple products, including DRAM (in its many forms) and the fabrication of Apple's A series SoCs. By acquiring SanDisk, Apple will be entering another market in direct competition with Samsung. That really is not too significant as this strange relationship was and will likely remain tense for the foreseeable future. By acquiring SanDisk, Apple will now be in direct competition with the other two major NAND manufacturers, Micron and SK Hynix. This would not be a major concern if Micron, SK Hynix and Samsung did not completely control the DRAM market. Again, Apple would find itself in competition with suppliers of essential components of all of its products.Apple has been a customer of Samsung for many years and has been able to avoid punitively absurd prices because Apple has always had other (friendly) options (albeit inferior options at times) when it comes to DRAM, NAND and its SOCs. Unless there are some major advances in the performance (endurance and speed) of 3D XPoint or some yet to be announced memory solution, DRAM will continue to be an absolute necessity in virtually all iDevices for the foreseeable future. Does Apple really want to make an acquisition that will impair its relationship with all three manufacturers of a component that is absolutely necessary to build all of its iDevices? Apple can and has used its weight as the 800-pound gorilla to get preferential treatment from its suppliers. However, Micron, SK Hynix and Samsung are not like Cirrus Logic or Omnivision Technologies. The three DRAM manufacturers have formed a powerful memory oligopoly that could severely hamper Apple's business by restricting the amount of DRAM Apple gets when the cyclical DRAM market eventually finds itself inevitably undersupplied again.Apple is able to receive preferential pricing from its suppliers on many components. However, Apple is unlikely to get this treatment on next generation NVM (non-volatile memory) in the short-intermediate term. 3D XPoint is not yet available, but will begin rolling out sometime in 2016. There have been no major announcements from SanDisk, Samsung or SK Hynix that point to these three memory giants rolling out their respective version of next generation NVMs in the near future. It's not difficult to imagine a world where Micron and Intel either completely control this next generation NVM market or find themselves significantly ahead on cost and performance relative to their competitors. In this pseudo-monopoly structure (assuming partners Micron and Intel act rationally together), Micron and Intel have all the power in negotiations. While 3D XPoint will initially likely be used mostly in IMDB and data centers, it is hard to imagine that XPoint will not eventually find its way into the standard memory hierarchy of consumer electronics (sometime after the 2018 timeframe). Does Apple really want to be a direct competitor to the companies that may be the only viable producer of next generation NVM in the not too distant future? I don't think so.Apple is more than a technology company now. It is a fashion brand. On top of straining important supplier relationships, Apple is unlikely to acquire SanDisk simply because the biggest electronics company in the world has little to no interest in selling flash drives, memory cards, SSDs and other commodity products that are unlikely to command premium pricing from Apple branding. Enterprise customers aren't going to pay huge premiums for an Apple logo on SSDs. While I underestimated Apple's ability to maintain significantly inflated margins on its smartphones and tablets, it is probably safe to assume that nobody other than the craziest of Apple fanboys will pay enormous premiums for a USB flash drive with an Apple logo.An acquisition of SanDisk might lower Apple's cost of NAND in the short-term (assuming Apple acquires SanDisk at a reasonably low price). However, it is highly probable (in my view) that SanDisk is about to lose its position as the lowest cost producer of NAND. When Micron and Intel start producing their 3D NAND product in high volume starting in 2016, SanDisk could find its relative position in NAND significantly impaired. On top of the Micron and Intel solution, Samsung's V-NAND could also prove to be a lower cost NAND (relative to SanDisk's BiCS) solution when the planar NAND era comes to an end. The big four NAND manufacturers each have a different 3D NAND architecture and the cost per bit (and performance) of each memory may be vastly different. There's a good chance that SanDisk's solution is inferior to that of (some of) its competitors, which would only further disincentivize Apple from acquiring SanDisk as the cost of alienating the other memory manufacturers would only get higher. In the most optimistic scenario, I do not believe Apple could realize anything more than minimal cost savings by building NAND in-house (via a SanDisk acquisition) instead of buying it from a third party.Even if Apple has some interest in acquiring SanDisk, it is highly unlikely that Apple would put in a bid of over $19 billion. Just because Apple has a 12-digit cash reserve does not mean that it will be willing to significantly overpay for the value that SanDisk brings to Apple. SanDisk adds little value for Apple in the long term. For Western Digital, SanDisk represents a potential lifeline when the HDD market inevitably collapses (in a couple years down the road). SanDisk is a nice to have for Apple at best. (I am not even sure if it is a nice to have for Apple.) Western Digital likely views SanDisk as critically important to its technology roadmap. As a result, I suspect the probability of an Apple acquisition of SanDisk is very low and probably far worse than 100-1 odds.In the end, I believe SanDisk's shareholders are very fortunate to get the big bid from Western Digital. It's a great offer and I highly doubt there will be a surprise offer that initiates a bidding war for SanDisk. Western Digital's acquisition of SanDisk will likely be immediately accretive to earnings and free cash flow each quarter. However. the bloated balance sheet loaded with debt poses significant long-term risk if Western Digital-SanDisk are unable to keep up with Samsung, Micron and Intel in the move to 3D NAND and SSDs. There is potential for the new company to end up with an inferior position in the NVM cost curve coupled with large interest payments. While short-term prospects may have marginally improved, I would avoid Western Digital as a long-term investment."

Just a day after global chip giant Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced a $5.5 billion investment that looked related to Unigroup, we're seeing yet another similarly large deal that has some indirect ties to this Chinese company linked to the nation's top science institution, Tsinghua University.This latest new deal will see hard disk maker Western Digital buy flash memory maker SanDisk in a cash and stock deal worth $19 billion (English article, Chinese article). China watchers will recall that the announcement of this deal comes just two weeks after a Unigroup affiliate paid $3.8 billion for 15 percent of Western Digital (previous post). I theorized a short time later that Unigroup's sudden thirst for memory could even prompt it to make a play for storage device giant EMC (EMC), which is in the process of being acquired by Dell in a blockbuster deal worth $67 billion (previous post).I'll summarize all the various recent Unigroup deals shortly and try to figure out how they fit together, but first let's review the latest blockbuster semiconductor merger that will bring together Western Digital and SanDisk. The deal values SanDisk stock at $86.50 per share, a 15 percent premium over its last close before the announcement. It would bring together Western Digital, which traditionally specialized in hard drives, with the world's fourth-largest maker of flash memory drives that power most mobile devices.Now that we've gotten the basic details out of the way, let's step back and review some of Unigroup's involvement in many of the sector's latest mega deals in the memory chip space. The Chinese company first burst into global headlines last year when Intel paid $1.5 billion for 20 percent of Unigroup's telecoms chip design company, which was formed through the combination of two China-based firms that were formerly listed in New York.Intel's $7 Bln China UpgradeSince that announcement, Intel has announced major upgrades for its two China chip plants, starting with a $1.6 billion overhaul announced late last year for its older fab in the interior city of Chengdu (previous post). Earlier this week it announced an even bigger upgrade worth up to $5.5 billion for its newer plant in the northeast city of Dalian (previous post).In the Dalian announcement Intel said it would convert the plant to make NAND memory chips, from its original design to make core processing units (CPUs) for PCs. Reports at the time of the Chengdu announcement didn't specify on the nature of that upgrade, but in retrospect it appears the plant could also be getting a similar makeover for memory chip production. Intel certainly isn't a cash-poor company, so it could be financing the upgrades by itself. But the timing of these two major China-based upgrades shortly after formation of its Unigroup joint venture certainly hint that its Chinese partner is helping to pay for the projects.Similarly, the fact that Unigroup became a major shareholder in Western Digital just two weeks ago implies the former may now be helping the latter to finance its new bid for SanDisk. One final piece of this puzzle is Unigroup's bid earlier this year for leading US memory chip maker Micron (NASDAQ:MU), which Unigroup abandoned due to political sensitivities.What seems to be emerging in all this is that Unigroup may be quietly trying to build up a NAND memory producer to rival global powerhouse Samsung, which controls about half of the market. That wouldn't be too surprising since China is the world's largest manufacturer of many of the gadgets that use NAND memory chips and the technology itself is relatively mature and thus something China could excel in.The biggest potential obstacle for Unigroup could be integrating so many diverse pieces to its emerging NAND machine, which would span several continents and many companies. But clearly the well-connected Unigroup is trying to execute Beijing's vision of moving up the high-tech value chain, meaning other NAND makers like Samsung could soon have a major new rival.Disclosure: None.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3588866,24276,2015-10-21T09:37:21-04:00,Western Digital is borrowing $18.4 billion to buy memory chip maker SanDisk.The company is expecting $3.775 billion from Unisplendour in China to help retire the debt.If this deal goes through it puts pressure on rivals to start dancing as well.,"Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) $19 billion agreement to buy SanDisk (SNDK) this morning is all about the leverage.The company secured $18.4 billion in debt financing to do the deal. Western Digital will retire some of its old debt, and some SanDisk debt, but the bulk of the money will go to SanDisk shareholders, with just a tiny bit of stock - .0176 of a share - added for spice.What this means is that Western Digital anticipates it will be able to raise margins considerably after the deal, because there will be a lot less competition in the memory chip market. The deal may put some pressure on Micron (NASDAQ:MU), the remaining big memory chip competitor, to seek a partner, but that company already has a sort-of partner in Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and is unlikely to move, since it would, like WDC, benefit from a margin expansion.The lesson for tech investors is that the memory business continues to consolidate. Western Digital will be using SanDisk chips as long-term storage in cloud servers, where it supplies companies like EMC (EMC), which is being bought by Dell. The hope is that it can now compete directly against those customers, not only with hard drive subsystems but with solid state memory subsystems, which are faster but more expensive.SanDisk had already been rising before this deal was announced, but its price of $86.10 means an even bigger pop can be anticipated when the stock opens.Sort of lost in all this is Western Digital's pending $3.775 billion investment from China's Tsinghua Unisplendour, at a price of $92.50 per Western Digital share, a huge premium over the $72.50/share it was trading in the pre-market.Unisplendour has just begun recovering from the losses suffered during China's stock market crash, where it fell from a peak of 120 Yuan to a low of below 50. It was halted at the Western Digital announcement trading at about 70. The SanDisk deal includes provision for China not approving the Unispledour investment in Western Digital - the stock portion of the deal would rise from less than 2% of one share to nearly 25% of one share.It's important to note that this is not a takeover by China of Western Digital. Adding Sandisk further dilutes Unisplendour's stake in the resulting company, protecting Western Digital from a creeping takeover while opening the China market. Shareholders need to be hoping the investment goes through, as it will greatly reduce Western Digital's debt burden. The Western Digital market cap is about $22 billion, the market cap of SanDisk is $15 billion, so $18.4 billion would be a substantial lift without the $3.775 billion in Chinese cash coming in, along with its cost advantages and margin improvements.If all this gets done Western Digital's long-time arch-rival, Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), could be in for a load of competitive hurt, and could come under pressure to get taken out itself. If you like to play mergers and didn't get into this one, that or Micron may be a place to look. This is not going to be the last move in the sector."
3600156,22786,2015-10-25T01:33:07-04:00,"Western Digital is overpaying for SanDisk, in an attempt to remain relevant.Storage demand is slowing and pricing for faster storage is falling.Risks ahead for Western Digital and Seagate.","Spinning hard disks are fast becoming a commodity, and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) knows it. Even though the interconnected web is creating more demand for storage space than ever, be it on devices, computers, or the cloud, there is a fundamental shift happening. Solid state drives are fast replacing drives. Western Digital's move to acquire SanDisk (SNDK) is an expensive one, and heightens risks for shareholders.Storage demand is slowing. Previously, companies could rely on enterprises for revenue growth. That is changing. As EMC Corp. (EMC) demonstrated, its earnings fell from $0.28 per share to $0.25. Sales barely changed, as the company made $6.08B, compared to $6.032B last year.Western Digital has a flaw in its plans for borrowing $18.4B to buy the overpriced firm, SanDisk. SanDisk's prospects in the solid state storage space are not assured, and trades at a premium at a stock price of $76.78. Not only is SanDisk's P/E 30 times, but the P/FCF (stock price to free cash flow) is 19.5 times. At these levels, the market is not discounting heavy competition ahead among the storage suppliers. Western Digital has its own problems too. Business is slowing and cash growth stalled, between 2014 and 2015. In the last four years, its cash leveled off at around $5B:in $ millionSource: Kapitall.comFortunately, free cash flow was steady in that time, but EBIT margin (%) fell from a peak of 17.06 percent to just 12.41 percent:Source: marketVis.IOSanDisk's EBIT margin is better, but also trended downward. This indicates there was higher competition amongst storage suppliers and weakening demand in the last few years:More competition ahead for Western DigitalMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is a competitive threat to Western Digital. Investors anticipate pressure for Micron, too, since its stock trades in the single-digit multiples: a P/E of 5.5 and forward P/E of 7.2 times. Looking ahead, Micron is readying 3D NAND and 3D Cross Point technology. It is converting its technology, expanding its Fab, and has a supply agreement with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel accelerated its foothold in this space by announcing it would return to memory manufacturing. Micron's shares actually sold off because its partnership with Intel is now in doubt. This implies higher pricing pressure for non-volatile memory for all players.Seagate Technology also strugglingWDC data by YChartsInvestors might look at Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) as an alternative for exposure in the storage space. Seagate trades at a P/E of just 7. Unfortunately, the commoditization of storage will hurt Seagate, too. Seagate preannounced on October 16 lower revenue and profitability. It cited weaker demand for its 4TB (terabyte) and 6TB drives.The sudden pace of consolidation in this space, first with Dell-EMC and now Western Digital-SanDisk will mean more downside pressure for storage suppliers. As Seagate struggles, Western Digital will be busy consolidating SanDisk in its business. It, along with Dell-EMC, will now carry higher debt loads. To manage that debt these companies must boost sales at any cost, increasing output and accepting any product selling price. Ultimately, this will mean lower profit margins for all players.Intel becomes an attractive gorillaThough Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) integrating across all channels from mobile devices to servers benefits the sector, Intel's vertical integration hurts non-volatile storage suppliers. Intel has the CPU and the GPU already, but offering non-volatile memory will add pressure to companies like Micron. With the market still shunning PC suppliers, investors should take advantage of the massive shifts happening - with Intel. Investors should consider avoiding hard-drive makers and instead, buying shares of Intel."

Investors have reacted negatively to the proposed acquisition of SanDisk and failed to appreciate the positive catalysts of several recent developments.The acquisition of SanDisk, which will be financed in part by the investment by Unisplendour, will transform WDC into a storage technology behemoth with a broader product set, deeper technology base, expanded addressable market, and superior execution capabilities vs Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), its major competitor.The market appears to be ignoring a slew of corporate developments that individually and collectively provide major catalysts for the stock going forward, including:Tsinghua Unisplendour InvestmentIn hindsight, he seems to be clearly alluding to the possibility of a transformative acquisition such as the SanDisk deal discussed in detail below.Among other things, the strategic tie up with a prestigious Chinese state-owned enterprise ought to facilitate market penetration in one of the juiciest markets in the world. The Chinese market is a huge and growing market that is rapidly evolving. Opportunities abound in hyperscale, telecom, etc.Not only does the investment provide a key plank in WDC's funding platform for the acquisition of SanDisk, but it may well have helped push the MFOCOM approval over the line. Both of these developments are discussed in more detail below.MOFCOM DecisionA favorable ruling recently received from China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) paves the way for the integration into a single company of WDC's legacy business and the HGST business unit acquired from Hitachi. On the recent conference call CEO, Steve Milligan, stated:Management expects the more than $400MM beneficial impact of the MOFCOM decision to materialize between the next 12 and 24 months.SanDisk AcquisitionOn October 21, 2015, WDC announced that it would be acquiring SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK) for a combination of cash and stock. The offer valued SanDisk common stock at $86.50 per share or a total equity value of approximately $19 billion, based on the weighted average price of WDC stock immediately prior to the announcement. Western plans to finance the deal and repay certain existing debt obligations of both companies by obtaining $18.4B in new debt facilities.The transaction doubles WDC's addressable market and expands its participation in higher-growth segments and accelerates its transformation into a storage solutions company with global scale, extensive product and technology assets, and deep expertise in non-volatile memory (NVM). Steve Milligan, chief executive officer, commented,WDC's primary goal in making the SanDisk acquisition is to expand its footprint in the enterprise SSD segment. This segment is outpacing overall market growth and presents a higher value opportunity for WDC. They also see growth opportunities in client SSDs and embedded solutions (tablets, cellphones etc.). SanDisk also has a strong presence in the removable (retail) segment. It's a great business but it's not a growing business.WDC projects $500MM of annual synergies from the acquisition which will be realized within 18 months of completion of the acquisition. The majority of these near-term synergies will be realized as a result of becoming vertically integrated in its enterprise SSD business. WDC also has hinted at additional synergies that will be realized over a longer time frame.While rumors of the death of the HDD have been greatly exaggerated for many years, there is no doubt that the next future of storage does belong to SSD. WDC sees 3D NAND as the next generation underlying storage media. The SanDisk acquisition will underpin its plans to produce products built on that architecture. In addition to the economic benefits outlined above, integrating SanDisk will improve its competitive profile and bring WDC into that future.The deal is expected to be accretive to EPS within 12 months of closing (not surprising given it's mostly in cash). SanDisk's NAND flash manufacturing JV with Toshiba will be maintained. It expects to continue paying its dividend, but will suspend its buyback program.Industry Conditions and Competitive PositioningMany investors have misjudged the strength of the hard drive business. They have myopically focused on the decline of the PC business as a harbinger of doom for HDDs. CEO Steve Milligan forcefully rebutted this thesis on the recent conference call:For the recently reported September quarter, industry demand for hard drives was better than expected, driven by strong demand for 2.5 inch devices for game consoles and notebook PCs as well as strong growth in video surveillance.WDC showed strength in the high margin enterprise hard drives segment which includes cloud services providers. WDC expects this segment to grow at 35% CAGR. Its high capacity helium drives give it a strong edge over Seagate, which is currently unable to field competitive products in this segment. More than 1 million units shipped in Q1 (the September quarter) including the 8 terabyte helium drive. A 10 terabyte helium drive is slated for release in the current fiscal year. WDC's margins benefited as it was able to ship these drives unopposed forcing Seagate to compete by discounting its 4 and 6 terabyte drives.The Bear CaseThe bears make the following points:The PC is dead! Well not exactly and not yet… While no one in their right mind would be bullish on the future of the PC market, it also is true that rumors of the death of the PC appear to have been greatly exaggerated. The industry may even experience a modest near-term bounce driven by the release of Windows 10 which appears to remedy the many defects of Windows 8 and a slew of new notebook products based on the latest high-performance, low-power consumption processors from Intel. Yes, the Wintel alliance is yet still alive and strong.The market also frets that WDC paid too much for SanDisk. On the face of it the purchase price at about 30X earnings does look high, especially for a company trading at a 10X valuation that is structuring part of the consideration in stock. WDC is buying SanDisk at or near a cyclical low in its market. Furthermore, it's able to immediately avail itself of substantial deal synergies that have very low execution risk as it is based on meeting WDC's own need for NAND.What about the substantial integration risk? WDC's seasoned management team has a strong track record of integrating acquisitions to create value, including some (e.g. the HGST deal) that were transformational for the company and its industry. If anyone can pull of an integration of this magnitude, WDC can.Will the Uni deal receive regulatory approval? Will the SanDisk acquisition impact this approval? Given that deal is for just 15% of the company, and Uni only gets one seat on the board and has no day-to-day management control, I do not believe there is a substantial regulatory risk. For the same reasons, I do not believe that the regulators will get hung up on the SanDisk deal.ConclusionThe market has failed to grasp the transformative impact of the developments listed above and the impact that they will have on WDC's competitive positioning and long-term viability. Specifically:I believe the stock is worth $90 per share based on 14X my estimated current year EPS of $6.40. This is 33% above Friday's close. Buy."

Annual dividend projected from $10,000 invested as $1K in each of the ten highest yielding stocks and total single share price of those ten stocks created the data points shown in green for price and blue for dividend.Actionable Conclusions: (1) NASDAQ 100 Dogs Retreated As (2) Dow Dogs Mixed Up After DecemberNASDAQ 100 top dividend payers increased in dividend and dropped in price after December. Aggregate single share price fell 3.74% as aggregate dividend from $10k invested rose up 8% to confirm the retreat.Dow dogs mixed up, however, with aggregate single share price for the ten increasing 4.9% between November 25, and January 20, while annual dividend from $10k invested as $1K in each of the top ten soared 9.73% according to IndexArb.As a result, the Dow dogs overbought condition (where aggregate single share price of the ten exceeded projected annual dividend from $10k invested as $1k each in those ten) barely changed after December.Actionable Conclusion (3): Dow Dogs Are OverboughtThe overhang was $250 or 65% for February; slid to $243 or 62% in March; gapped to $295 or 81% for a new record in April; then broke the new annual record again in May at $311 or 87%. June saw the gap narrow to $286 or 77%. The July/August market set a new high for the gap at $329 or 85%. September shrank the gap to $279 or 67%. October expanded the chasm again to $323 or 82%. November-December constricted the gap somewhat to $271 or 70%. January narrowed the gap slightly to $267 or 63%.This gap between high share price and low dividend per $1k invested shows an overbought condition. Meaning, these are low risk and low opportunity Dow dogs.Compared to the DOW these NASDAQ ten, appear to be tracking a little past a ""normal"" pattern of aggregate dividend value of $1k investments in each exceeding the aggregate single share price.

The results led to the actionable conclusions discussed below.Actionable Conclusions: (4) 10 Leading NASDAQ 100 Dogs Displayed 45.21% Average Upsides By January 2017 Analyst Target ReadingsActionable Conclusion (5): Wall St. Wizards Projected A 26.82% Average 1 yr. Upside for Top 30 NASDAQ 100 Dogs To January 20, 2017Top 30 dogs on the NASDAQ 100 index stock list graphed below show relative strengths by dividend and price as of January 20, 2016 and those projected by analyst median price target estimates to the same date in 2017.A hypothetical $1000 investment in each equity was divided by the current share price to find the number of shares purchased. The number of shares was then multiplied by projected annual dividend amounts to find the dividend return. Thereafter the analyst mean target price was used to gauge each stock's upside to 2017.Historic prices and actual dividends paid from $1000 invested in each of the highest yielding stocks and the aggregate single share prices of those thirty stocks divided by 3 created the data points for 2016. Projections based on estimated increases in dividend amounts from $1000 invested in the thirty highest yielding stocks and aggregate one-year analyst target share prices from Yahoo Finance divided by 3 created the 2017 data points on the chart below: green for price and blue for dividend.Actionable Conclusion (6): Wall St. Wizards Project A 21.09% Average Net Gain from Top 30 NASDAQ 100 Dogs By January 2017Yahoo reported Thomson/First Call analyst survey numbers predicted a 19.6% lower dividend from $10K invested as $1k in the average ten of this group, while aggregate single share price of those ten was predicted to increase 28.3% in the coming year. Notice that the 2015-16 graph shows price above dividend.

3583106,82056,2015-10-20T15:50:25-04:00,SanDisk supposedly approaches Micron and Western Digital about a buyout.SanDisk has Joint Venture agreement with Toshiba that complicates matters.Are there other companies that might be interested in SanDisk and at what price?,"I never understood the premium valuation SanDisk (SNDK) had in the NAND market. Oh, I know they were growing fast and had good PR but what exactly did they have that made their products superior?Well last year, we found out that at least some of their products were indeed inferior. The famous loss of contract to a ""major customer"" (turned out to be Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) due to ""product qualification delays"" caused panic in the executive suite and a significant drop in stock price. They have never really recovered either in reputation or stock price. As you can see from the chart below, SNDK price dropped by more than 50% until the recent, ""buy me now"" promotion began last week. Even now, they are selling at what I consider to be an exaggerated price of 27 times earnings.Source: bigcharts.comSanDisk is a fabless producer using Toshiba's (OTCPK:TOSYY) Yokkaichi production line in a Joint Venture. Toshiba, of course, invented NAND and has some top-notch NAND products such as the 15nm 48 layer 3D NAND. One question overriding any acquisition of SanDisk is Toshiba's control of the Fabs. One has to assume that SanDisk and Toshiba have agreed on SNDK putting itself up for sale. The other question regarding the JV is who controls the IP. We will assume it takes at least $15B to complete the purchase.So here is my breakdown of the possible suitors.1. ToshibaIt would make sense that the first company to consider a buyout would be the JV partner. The issue is Toshiba has many other problems including the recent accounting scandal plus the subsequent resignation of its CEO. In addition, Toshiba is losing money in spite of its huge $66B in revenue. And its position in the semiconductor industry has fallen from 2nd in 2000 to 8th in 2015. Perhaps Toshiba does not think SNDK is worth what it is selling for and is sandbagging the process awaiting a much lower price. On the other hand, Toshiba may just be hoping that a buyout would trigger more sales from its production lines.My odds: a weak maybe.2. Micron (NASDAQ:MU)There is rampant speculation that Micron may be a bidder but this seems unlikely to me. First of all, it has the JV with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) so you would have a very complex transaction including 4 companies involved in two JVs. Secondly, Micron already is in the midst of two significant product upgrades in 3D NAND and 3D XPoint. And the last thing Micron needs at this moment in time is another big distraction. What Micron management really needs to do for the next year or so is to focus and concentrate on its current set of priorities i.e. getting 3D NAND and 3D XPoint profitably out the door in commercial quantities. An acquisition of this size would confuse investors even more than they are now. And since Micron does not have a lot of spare cash, one would have to ask the wisdom of buying a 27X P/E stock with 8X P/E stock.My odds: for Micron shareholders' sake, I hope the odds are zero.3. Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC)If there is a company that is desperate for change, it is WDC. Their sales curve has turned down, their quarterly profit has dropped 30% YoY and their main product, hard disk drives, is going the way of the Dodo bird. Somehow, in spite of the depressing news they were able to raise $3.75b from Unisplendour (UNIS) recently and now have more than $8B in cash. That would allow WDC to make a nice down payment on the $15B acquisition with the rest coming from shares.Unisplendour is related to Tsinghua Unigroup, the Chinese company that recently made a $23B bid for Micron and hired one of Micron's executives away. And although WDC has a marketing agreement with Intel for enterprise SSDs, I'd guess that deal is just a stopgap measure without much margin or profit for WDC. As for the possibility of a joint effort with Micron to purchase SanDisk, the mind reels with the complexities inherent in a deal that could involve 6 corporate entities: SanDisk, WDC, MU, Intel, Toshiba and maybe Tsinghua. That would be a great deal for the lawyers, not so sure it would benefit anyone else.My odds: over 50% that WDC by itself acquires SNDK.  Dodo Bird Source: Wikipedia.4. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF)In some ways Samsung reminds me of GE (NYSE:GE) under Jack Welch. Welch's rule was if you could not be #1 or #2 in an industry then get out of it. Samsung is #1 in DRAM, NAND, TVs, LED screens et al and #2 in cell phones and consumer appliances. But their lead in NAND is falling as seen in the chart below and they could expand their lead considerably with the acquisition of SNDK. It would also eliminate a significant competitor. And depending upon the JV agreement with Toshiba, perhaps they could move SNDK production to their new $17B fab in 2017. And who knows maybe Toshiba's BiCS 3D-NAND 15nm process is superior to Samsung's V-NAND. Most importantly, Samsung has $56B in cash meaning they are the only acquirer who could pay cash and cash speaks very loudly at the bargaining table. Source: dram exchange.My odds: A long shot at best.Well those are my top 4 picks to acquire SanDisk. There are possibly others such as SK Hynix and even Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) but they too are long shots in my opinion. Of the 4, my pick is Western Digital who with Tsinghua Unigroup's help could take over SNDK and probably save Western Digital from extinction.I part with a quote from one of my favorite athletes, Evel Knievel:""Anybody can jump a motorcycle. The trouble begins when you try to land it.""Evel KnievelLet the jumping begin, we will check on the landing later.Late update Oct. 19th 4.42PM Marketwatch reports MU/WDC deal for SNDK ""advances"" with WDC whatever that means. MU stock goes down immediately by .31, WDC down 1.51 (@ 6:42PM). WDC does not have a choice, MU does lets hope common sense prevails in MU headquarters and they drop out of the bidding.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3574566,51302,2015-10-15T10:52:08-04:00,"WDC is currently undervalued.The Unisplendour Investment has given WDC a large amount of cash.That cash would best be used re-investing in the core business, repurchasing shares or increasing dividends.If WDC purchases SanDisk, it will no longer be undervalued.","IntroductionIn this article, I want to try and determine the fair value of Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) common stock. To model WDC's fair value I used a discounted cash flow model, which I consider to be the best model for long-term equity evaluation. There appears to be a decent chance that WDC will try to acquire SanDisk in the near future and towards the end of the article I will discuss how that potential purchase affects my estimate of fair value. Before going any further, you can find all the data used in this article here.WDC's Fair Value and Model SetupWDC is fairly valued at around $95 and at the writing of this article WDC is trading around $83. Earnings will continue to grow around 8% in the near term and dividend per share payments will continue to rise. Because of the investment by Unisplendour, WDC also has a large amount of cash that can be used for dividends, share buybacks or acquisitions.I believe that WDC's earnings growth will continue at 8% in the short term despite the recent drop in sales within Asia and, specifically, China. Demand for data storage is growing steadily and WDC has a solid economic moat around its operations selling hard disk drives and solid state storage drives. Its only serious competitor is Seagate (NASDAQ:STX). Moreover, the recent investment of Unisplendour for a 15% stake in WDC appears to have been a tit for tat with the Chinese Ministry of Commerce to get final approval for WDC's merger with Hitachi GST. That merger, if approved, would give WDC excellent growth opportunities in China. Even if the merger approval does not happen, WDC's current operations will grow at an enviable pace - nearly 10% return on assets (that figure includes the increase in assets from the Hitachi GST merger, even though the earnings from Hitachi are not included). With the company's current operations, I believe a conservative estimate of WDC's earnings growth is to begin growing at an annual rate of 8% and declining to zero within 15 years.WDC has a short history of paying dividends and used about 20% of earnings to fund the payments over the last few years. The dividend is currently yielding about 2.5%, which is a respectable, but not a great yield in the current interest rate environment.Share repurchases have been a drain on earnings. Since 2008, the 30% of total earnings have been used to repurchase shares. The result of this massive use of shareholder money has been an increase in total shares outstanding. Some of that increase was due to the Hitachi acquisition and some of it is due to employee compensation. I do not think stock dilution should be used in most acquisitions because no matter how valuable the acquisition, its profits are now spread out among a larger group of shareholders than if cash or debt were used. Also, management would do better by shareholders to structure employee compensation in a way that still retains talent without diluting the owners.When modeling a company's cash flows far into the future, one needs to find an appropriate estimate for what the discount rate should be. A discount rate has two components: the risk-free rate and the risk premium rate. For the early years of the model, finding the risk-free rate is relatively simple - simply use the current long-term U.S. Treasury Bond rates. However, when deciding to discount cash flows 20, 30 or even 40 years in the future, one cannot assume that current interest rates will continue into the future. Interest rates have never remained steady over a 50-year period. Using the current treasury curve to determine future rates also is inaccurate. Look at the historical treasury rates here - they do not correlate well with how interest rates actually changed. The best way to model long-term interest rates is to look at their historical movements, assume that they are mean-reverting, which they have historically been, and look at how they behaved in the 50 years following a time period similar to our own. In the 50 years following those times when interest rates were around 2%, the interest rates rose over a 15 - 25 year period to average about 6%. It's uncertain whether history will repeat, but I believe that to be the best assumption when thinking about where future rates are heading in the next 50 years.The second part of the discount rate is the risk premium rate. My model assumes a risk premium of 11%, which was determined by taking the average return on equity for the last 10 years and dividing by the current market price. Determining the equity risk premium for an individual stock is difficult, but this method has the advantage of being relatively accurate and easy to compute.Price SensitivitiesI believe WDC's fair value to be around $95. As I mentioned above, there is speculation that WDC is planning on using the money they received from the Unisplendour investment to help purchase SanDisk. I believe this would be a mistake because SanDisk's industry is both cyclical and highly competitive. The returns on such an investment would be low and uncertain. If WDC does buy SanDisk, their shareholders will have been diluted by 15% due to the Unisplendour investment in order to buy a company outside of WDC's core, very profitable business of selling hard disk drives and solid state drives. My fair price estimate assumes that SanDisk will not be purchased and that the Hitachi merger will be held up by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce for some time. I assumed that earnings would grow at 8% a year, with growth going to zero after 15 years. Also, I assumed that the risk-free component of the discount rate would rise from the current value of 2% to around 6% in 25 years. However, I also ran my model under differing assumptions regarding the potential purchase of SanDisk.My low estimate is around $70. This estimate is based on WDC using the Unisplendour cash to partially buy SanDisk while issuing shares or debt to cover the rest of the purchase. It also assumes that the merger with Hitachi is not given final approval by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and higher than average long-term interest rates for the next 50 years.The high estimate would be around $110, assuming SanDisk is not purchased and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce finalizes the Hitachi merger soon. Unisplendour purchased its 15% stake in WDC at over $90 per share and the market price is currently in the low $80s. WDC should begin purchasing back as much of their shares as possible below $90 to help offset shareholder dilution. With the cash left, they could re-invest in their core business, if there are good investment opportunities, or return to the money to shareholders via dividend increases. This price estimate also assumes interest rates are lower than the historical average at around 4-5% over the next 50 years.ConclusionAfter modeling a number of assumptions, I believe that WDC undervalued if it chooses not to purchase SanDisk. If it does end up buying the company, I believe shareholders will have been heavily diluted simply to acquire a business that will generate sub-par returns long into the future."
3586016,60321,2015-10-20T14:21:41-04:00,"The synergies Micron would achieve by acquiring SanDisk would be tremendous including pricing power and increased capacity and new customers.On the other hand, if SanDisk is not acquired by Micron and instead is acquired by Western Digital it would solidify Micron as the No. 4 player in NAND.The sale of SanDisk would help the NAND market as whole whether or not SanDisk is acquired by Micron.However, Micron's pricing power and gross margins would be much better off with SanDisk than without them.","Who will have the last dance with SanDisk (SNDK)? Memory industry M&A chatter continues to surround top memory plays. Micron (NASDAQ:MU) received a bid from Tsinghua in July and now SanDisk is reported to have hired bankers and held talks with Micron and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) regarding a possible sale. Bloomberg reported late Monday that SanDisk is in advanced discussions with Western Digital.The DRAM industry is mature and only has three key players - Micron, Hynix and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) - that control 85% of the market. However, on the NAND side of the house there are five key players with market shares greater than 10% and six key players if you include Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) (market share less than 10%). On the NAND side of the fence Micron currently sits in the No. 4 spot behind SanDisk No. 3, Toshiba No. 2 and Samsung No. 1 and ahead of SK Hynix in the 5th slot. By acquiring SanDisk, Micron can leapfrog to the No. 1 spot and control just over a 30% share. If SanDisk were to be acquired by Micron the top three NAND suppliers would control over 80% of the market, which would rival the DRAM industry in terms of competitive mix.Image SourceThe synergies Micron would achieve by acquiring SanDisk would be tremendous including pricing power and increased capacity and new customers. The biggest question that remains is at what price can SanDisk be acquired? The memory industry is expected to show continued weakness over the next two to three quarters driven by weak PC sales. However, as we head into the second half of 2016 the macro environment should improve, which will drive margin and EPS expansion.My expectation is that if SanDisk gets acquired the purchase price will ultimately be between $75 and $85. The purchase price is driven by future earnings in FY17 and beyond and largely discounts a transitional year for memory players in FY16. An offer from Micron to acquire SanDisk would be in the form of Micron stock for roughly 80 cents on the dollar.Micron would acquire new customers and expand the company's presence within removable storage and embedded solutions including mobile. The deal also would put Micron in a position to strip operating and manufacturing costs out of equation. Micron would become a more attractive asset with SanDisk under its belt than without the company.On the other hand if SanDisk is not acquired by Micron and instead is acquired by Western Digital it would solidify Micron as the No. 4 player in NAND for the foreseeable future. The sale of SanDisk would help the NAND market as whole whether or not SanDisk is acquired by Micron. However, Micron's pricing power and gross margins would be much better off with SanDisk than without them."
3539776,92916,2015-09-29T12:00:52-04:00,"Micron will have cheaper 3D NAND than SanDisk within a year. Micron will jump from NAND laggard to NAND leader.Micron's engineering advantage in NAND along with its ability to produce DRAM, NOR and XPoint will give Micron a huge edge in MCPs (multichip packages).There is a paired trade opportunity: Buy MU and short SNDK as MU will outperform SNDK. I currently slightly prefer going long MU and having no position in SNDK.","Micron (NASDAQ: MU) and SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) are the last two major memory manufacturers in the United States. SanDisk currently has a market cap of about $10 billion and Micron has a market cap of about $15.1 billion. SanDisk makes NAND flash chips. Micron manufactures NAND, NOR and DRAM. In the not too distant future, Micron will also be manufacturing 3D XPoint, a potentially revolutionary non-volatile memory. I want to compare the two companies and give a relative value assessment of Micron and SanDisk.Over the last few years, SanDisk has been the cost leader in producing planar NAND. Micron has been trailing SanDisk by a wide margin as it has been unable to create a cost competitive NAND for many years now, and the relative value of the two firms has reflected Micron's inferiority in NAND compared to SanDisk. While I arrived at slightly different numbers, this article by Seeking Alpha contributor William Tidwell gives a good overview explaining how inferior Micron's NAND technology has been relative to SanDisk and the rest of the market (Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF)).SanDisk may also have an advantage over Micron in executive leadership. SanDisk is led by Sanjay Mehrotra, President, CEO and co-founder of the firm. He has been with SanDisk since 1988, and he is a highly respected engineer and executive in the semiconductor industry. He is listed as the inventor on more than 70 patents mostly focused on non-volatile memory and flash memory systems. To those who have listened to him on SanDisk's conference calls, he sounds confident and really gives the impression that he is clearly the smartest man in the room (because he usually is).Micron is led by its CEO Mark Durcan. Durcan has been a 3-decade veteran of Micron. It certainly was not in the plans of the company to ever promote him to CEO. On February 2, 2012, the then 50-year-old Durcan announced his decision to retire from Micron. The following day, Steve Appleton, who was the CEO of Micron at the time, unexpectedly died in a plane accident. A few days later, Durcan was named the new CEO of Micron.Durcan is known for his poor presentations skills and his inability to inspire shareholders. Around the 20:37 mark of this video, where Micron and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) jointly announce 3D XPoint to the world, Durcan and Intel's Rob Crooke open up a cabinet to reveal the first wafer of 3D XPoint. It seems that Durcan is expecting a huge applause to this exciting round disk that looks pretty much like any other 300 mm wafer to the naked eye.It is fortunate that Micron doesn't heavily depend on Durcan to sell products directly to consumers. While Durcan is certainly far from incompetent, I believe few Micron shareholders would balk at an opportunity to swap Durcan for Mehrotra.While SanDisk has been the operationally superior company over the last couple of years, Micron has positioned itself to become the leader of the industry going forward. The future of NAND is clearly 3D NAND. In this next evolutionary step of NAND technology, Micron has taken the lead from SanDisk. Micron is continuing its partnership with Intel and will begin shipping 3D NAND in high volumes at least several months before SanDisk and its partner Toshiba will.With the available information today, it appears that Micron/Intel's 384 Gb 32-layer 3D NAND will be the highest bit density NAND die around in 2016. Samsung was the first memory company to put 3D NAND in the market, but Intel and Micron will have the lowest cost NAND in the market by the end of next year.Micron and Intel have chosen to go with a floating gate in their 3D NAND design. SanDisk (along with Toshiba), Samsung and SK Hynix have elected to use a charge trap design instead. Here is an article that describes the benefits of charge traps over floating gates. Floating gate cells have been used for decades and have proven to be reliable. There has also been talk of some significant trouble with leaky charge traps in Samsung's 3D NAND.The ""leakiness"" of charge traps relative to floating gates has been a known challenge that may not quite be solved yet. This vastly different design that Micron and Intel have chosen compared to its competitors creates some significant risks. If charge traps are the future of 3D NAND, Intel and Micron will find themselves even further behind in NAND than they already are. However, if the charge trap designs for 3D NAND prove to be inferior, Intel and Micron will find themselves alone as the kings of NAND. Both designs also may end up working out and no company realizes a significant edge with their design choice.SanDisk will suffer from being a NAND only manufacturer. In the important mobile market, MCPs (Multi Chip Packages) are the future. An MCP in a smartphone typically combines NAND with DRAM in a single package. (In the future, this package may also contain 3D XPoint.) The high end of the smartphone market will continue to use separate NAND and DRAM packages.While using discrete DRAM and NAND units allows for greater customization and potentially better performance, MCPs eliminate the need for smartphone manufacturers to worry about controllers and firmware required to manage memory in the smartphone. The time required to design the hardware is significantly reduced by using an MCP. Ivan Donaldson of Micron stated in June 2015 at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch technology conference that 70% of mobile phones will migrate to MCPs by this year. I would expect that number to climb over time.Micron, SK Hynix and Samsung produce both DRAM and NAND. Because of this, these three SanDisk competitors can build MCPs on their own. SanDisk buys its DRAM from SK Hynix in order to build MCPs, which means the cost of DRAM for SanDisk is higher than that of all of its major competitors in the market. Because SanDisk has the lowest cost NAND, the disadvantage of having to buy NAND from a competitor is partially offset.However, Micron and Intel will likely have the lowest cost NAND chip in mass production next year. This means that Micron will have access to both cheaper NAND and cheaper DRAM, and therefore should have a far lower cost in building MCPs than SanDisk will. Micron will have a far higher gross margin than SanDisk in this market.SSDs (Solid State Drives) are the future. It's hard to argue against this. In a previous article, I discussed the process of SSDs replacing HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) and how scaling 3D NAND will be key to speeding up the conversion. By losing the cost leadership in NAND (which I equate to engineering leadership), SanDisk will no longer be able to reap higher than industry gross margins in the future.Micron and Intel have revealed their next generation non-volatile memory. It would be beyond shocking to hear that Samsung is not already working hard on developing their response to Intel and Micron's 3D XPoint. SK Hynix is likely working on their own response as well. If SanDisk is working on a next generation non-volatile memory, it is almost certainly far behind Intel and Micron currently, and probably also lagging behind its Korean foes.While 3D XPoint is up to 1000 times faster and has significantly higher endurance than NAND, it will not be cost competitive with NAND anytime soon. However, all signs point to 3D XPoint (or another next generation non-volatile memory) eventually becoming the memory of choice in SSDs in the distant future. In the intermediate era, 3D XPoint will become a part of the high-end SSD memory hierarchy. In hybrid hard drives today, a small amount of NAND serves as a cache for the HDD. By 2018, I expect to see hybrid hard drives where a 3D XPoint die will be placed in a SSD and serve as a cache for the slower NAND.If you take a look at the charts of Micron and SanDisk over the last few years, you will see a high correlation between their stock prices. I've attached a two-year chart from Yahoo Finance below.Here is a snapshot presentation of the trailing 12-month key metrics of Micron and SanDisk (using data from Capital IQ).Looking at the EV/EBITDA, trailing 12-month P/E, forward P/E, P/S or any metric you want to look at, SanDisk has consistently traded at higher multiples than Micron. That higher multiple was justified based on the higher gross margins and engineering superiority of SanDisk. That makes sense to me. However, by 2018, I firmly believe SanDisk's gross margins will have fallen a bit and Micron's gross margins will have increased significantly from today. I think it is inevitable for Micron to eventually realize higher gross margins than SanDisk. As a result, I expect Micron to significantly outperform SanDisk over the long run.Micron's partner in non-volatile memory (Intel) has a better engineering team and stronger financial position than SanDisk's partner (Toshiba). Micron is leaping from NAND laggard to overtake SanDisk as the NAND leader within a year from now. Micron, Samsung and SK Hynix can manipulate worldwide NAND wafer capacity (and price per GB) as they may convert their NAND wafers to produce DRAM (or another non-volatile memory or logic) or may convert their DRAM wafers to NAND capacity as they see fit.SanDisk does not enjoy this luxury. SanDisk will not have a cost competitive MCP for the mobile market once 3D NAND from its competitors eliminates its cost advantage in NAND. SanDisk will become the runt of the memory oligopoly. This presents an interesting paired trade opportunity of buying shares of Micron and shorting shares of SanDisk. While I am not convinced SanDisk's stock will fall significantly over the next few years, I firmly believe SanDisk shareholders should sell their shares of SNDK and buy MU now.I think investors should be buying MU regardless of their position in SNDK or any other holding. This is an incredible bargain to be able to buy shares of a large cap company with significant growth prospects and low valuation that is so hated by the market right now. I am looking at the long-term picture and I may get whacked after this week's earnings announcement, but I reiterate that Micron should be a strong buy."
3502466,88626,2015-09-10T13:43:22-04:00,"SanDisk saw a decline in revenue in the first half of 2015 partly due to growing demand for low-end SATA SSDs in the enterprise market.With the advent of PCIe SSDs and more advanced NVMe PCIe SSDs, SanDisk’s revenue should bounce back.I believe the stock is attractively valued at the current price with significant upside potential.","SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) is poised to generate millions in revenue from enterprise flash hardware solutions. Recently the company's stock has been upgraded by some notable analysts due to its prospects in enterprise SSD. One of them suggested that the enterprise SSD market would grow at a CAGR of 20% in the next few years.I also believe that the enterprise SSD market is expected to see substantial growth going forward, although a 20% CAGR seems a bit too optimistic. Nonetheless, SanDisk's current and upcoming product pipeline in PCIe-based SSDs is robust enough to drive substantial revenue growth.The Fusion-io Product Line to Drive GrowthAmong SanDisk's current products in enterprise SSDs, I believe its Fusion-io product line is most significant in order to boost revenue growth. SanDisk's acquisition of Fusion-io last year was a crucial decision for its future success. I expect that its newly-introduced Fusion ioMemory PCIe application accelerators will see significant adoption going forward primarily due to lower cost of ownership. The product, which is a combination of NAND flash and VSL (virtual storage layer) data access acceleration software, has the potential to deliver 4x performance at ~60% lower cost, compared to the company's earlier version of the product.Introduction of relevant software plays an important role in marketing the hardware solutions. SanDisk recently launched FlashSoft caching software which helps reduce storage latency of flash storage in servers. The software will further boost the performance of Fusion ioMemory PCIe application accelerators.The enterprise PCIe market is expected to witness significant expansion in the next three years or so with the introduction of NVMe (non-volatile memory express) infrastructure. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) has already launched NVMe PCIe SSDs earlier this year, and SanDisk is planning to enter the market in mid-2016, the company said. Although SanDisk will not get the first-mover advantage here, it will certainly emerge as a strong player in the NVMe space with its array of enterprise flash hardware and software solutions.ValuationIn the second quarter the company's revenue was $1.24 billion, a decline of 24% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Revenue declined primarily due to lower than expected demand in the enterprise market and supply bottlenecks as a result of rebuilding inventory. Earlier the company anticipated that revenue growth will be softer in enterprise SSDs with low-end SATA-based enterprise-grade SSDs becoming popular. However, with PCIe SSDs offering much higher speed at a much lower cost, the prevailing market trend is bound to change from 2016 onwards. Despite the advent of PCIe SSDs, the company wants to remain equally competitive in the SATA market as before. In order to achieve this, in the second quarter it has introduced a 15 nanometer based 2 terabyte SATA SSD.The company expects that its full-year 2015 revenue will be between $6.5 billion and $6.8 billion. I believe that SanDisk's full-year 2016 revenue will grow substantially toward $7.75 billion or $36.40 per share (assuming ~15% year-over-year revenue growth) due to growing adoption of PCIe-based SSDs. A sales multiple of 2.5x leads to its share price of $91, which is achievable during the next year (assuming stock market conditions in general remain healthy).ConclusionAlthough the enterprise SSD market will drive the majority of SanDisk's revenue growth in the next few years, newer flash markets such as industrial, automotive, connected home and the Internet of Things will fast become relevant to SSD players including SanDisk. SanDisk is well-positioned to grab the opportunity with its upcoming and existing SSD solutions, which are not only competitive but also cost effective.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3556876,25265,2015-10-08T13:07:27-04:00,"Last week Western Digital announced a major strategic investment in the company by Unisplendour Corp.This large cash infusion likely points to a major strategic purchase by Western Digital, possibly a NAND flash producer.Whatever the company ends up doing with the cash, I am confident it will make good use of it.","On September 30 Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) announced that Unisplendour Corporation Limited (Unis) would make an equity investment of $3.775B in the company in exchange for a 15% equity stake. The shares will be sold for $92.50 each, which was a 25% premium to the trading price the day before the announcement. As expected, Western Digital shares closed $10/share higher the day of the announcement. The investment is a significant endorsement of Western Digital's business and strategy.The equity stake will be paid out in newly issued shares, so this will dilute current shareholders - though the 25% premium to the previous day's trading price certain cushions the blow. The deal is also filled with provisions to protect existing Western Digital shareholders from any potential take-over. Unisplendour will only be given one board seat, which will be revoked if Unis' stake falls below 10%. The agreement is also subject to a five-year standstill and voting restrictions on board matters. Unis also agreed to a five-year lock-up on its shares, with just a limited number of shares becoming available for sale each year.The closing of this transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals in the U.S., however regulators are not expected to present any major objections. The U.S. Committee on Foreign Investments (CFIUS) could review this transaction, however this deal will not result in a change of control at Western Digital, so technically CFIUS should not object. The deal appears carefully crafted to ensure the current board will remain firmly in control of this company. I expect the deal to close by Q1 2016.Who is Unisplendour?Unisplendour is a Chinese technology company that makes computers, computer parts, networking equipment, peripherals, and software. It is part of China's Tsinghau University, which is leading a movement of China-based investment in U.S. tech companies. China is seeking to procure technologies for its own use. Over the summer Unigroup was reportedly preparing a $23B bid for Micron, However that deal would likely face insurmountable objection from U.S. regulators, and so the deal appears to be dead at this point. Also last week, a Chinese investor group reportedly offered nearly $4B for Synaptics, a maker of touch screens for mobile computing. All these moves show China's increasing commitment to purchasing the building blocks for a technology industry at home.Why would Western Digital do this deal?As of June 30, Western Digital's balance sheet showed the company had nearly $5.3B in cash versus only $2.6B in debt. Over the last 12 months the company generated $1.6B in free-cash-flow. Since the Hitachi acquisition in 2012, the company has spent less than $1.1B on smaller, bolt-on acquisitions meant to expand its product portfolio and jump start its efforts in the enterprise SSD space. The company is also generous with shareholders, returning about 50 percent of free-cash-flow to investors via dividends and buybacks. On the surface, it is difficult to see why Western Digital would need such a large influx of cash. The company is under-levered at less than 1x EBITDA (Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) is levered 1.8x), so there is plenty of debt capacity available if need be for acquisitions should an opportunity arise. Issuing debt would also not be dilutive.As I see it there are only two reasons why Western Digital would raise this amount of capital in the form of new equity issued to Unisplendour: this was either a condition of MOFCOM approval to integrate Hitachi operations into Western Digital and/or Western Digital is planning on making a big move - possibly bidding for a flash memory maker. Let's review each. As I pointed out in a previous article, Western Digital is seeking approval from China's Anti-Monolopy Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) to fully integrate Hitachi's operations in China into Western Digital. Removing all the restrictions would allow the company to save $300M+ annually in operating costs. I can't help but think this investment from Unisplendour is really being driven by MOFCOM in a scratch my back and I'll scratch yours kinda way. By that I mean Western Digital agrees to accept a minority ownership stake from a Chinese technology company in exchange for approval to integrate Hitachi's operations in a sort of take it or leave it scenario. Western Digital took it. Now we'll have to see if a MOFCOM approval comes through. When you think about it, the deal is not really all that bad for shareholders. The investment was made at a 25% premium to the share price pre-announcement. Even today it is still a 10% premium to the stock price, and it provides a lot of added financial flexibility.That leads me to a second possible reason Western Digital would accept the investment: it wants to make a large acquisition/investment in another company. The only purchase that seems to make a lot of sense to me would be SanDisk - and even that I'm not sure about. SanDisk seems to have fallen behind in the NAND race, particularly 3D NAND. Pricing has also proved more competitive than anticipated as global supply swells. As such SanDisk's revenues and stock price have been beaten up pretty badly. The stock is down 43% from its 52-week high, having recovered in recent weeks due principally to renewed M&A rumors. Buying SanDisk would give Western Digital a major presence in the growing flash memory space and an in-house supply of NAND for its SSDs. This solid state technology will likely one day replace a large majority of the mechanical hard disk drives in use today. So strategically it could make sense for Western Digital to try to purchase the company. With SanDisk having a $10.6B enterprise value, Western Digital could possibly pull off the acquisition (likely price tag of $12B or higher). Micron is likely too large as it already has a $19B market cap and an even larger enterprise value. No other NAND flash makers are possibly in play.I don't see Western Digital making a large move downstream and buying a storage solutions company like NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP). Though NTAP stock does appear very cheap (LTM free-cash-flow yield through the enterprise value is a whopping 17.5%), it seems a lot riskier to go deeper into storage solutions at a time when the industry is changing so rapidly. The future of storage is clearly in flash and even with recent weakness SanDisk still has EBITDA margins north of 20% whereas NetApp's fell into the single-digits last quarter.So far the only thing Western Digital has said about the $3.8B cash infusion is what it put in the press release announcing the deal. ""The equity investment by Unis will help facilitate our growth as we look to capitalize on the many opportunities and changes within the global storage industry,"" said Steve Milligan, president and chief executive officer, Western Digital. This appear to signal that the company will use the capital to facilitate a major acquisition. Of course the company could also use cash to buyback shares. At today's stock price the company could theoretically use the entire $3.8B to repurchase shares and reduce the share count to below what it was before the investment by Unisplendour. Of course the deal hasn't closed yet, but if the stock price is still meaningfully below $92.50 when the deal does close I expect the company to be more aggressive buying back stock.ConclusionsLate last week news surfaced that Mofcom is close to making a public ruling on the lift hold-separate with Hitachi. Bloomberg reported the following information from DealReporter, which is usually a reliable source.If this is true it appears MOFCOM will at least partially lift the hold separate mandate. This means Western Digital's free-cash-flow could be boosted by several hundred million dollars annually, depending how many of the restrictions are lifted. If we do see MOFCOM approval in the coming months, it is difficult to imagine the Unisplendour transaction was not related. The question then becomes what is the company going to do with all that cash? I for one have a pretty high degree of confidence that this company will make a good move with this capital. Management should be commended for pursuing the lift hold-separate when others thought it was a waste of time (i.e., Seagate). I remain optimistic about Western Digital's current businesses. I do not believe the company will squander this new capital. They have proved to be good stewards of capital. Third quarter earnings should be interesting, as they will shed light on the current state of the PC market. In addition I'd expect management to provide more color on the Unis investment and MOFCOM decision."
3350075,23471,2015-07-23T12:02:59-04:00,"WDC is suitable for both the Defensive Investor and the Enterprising Investor following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is undervalued at the present time.The market is implying 2.53% annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, which is less than the rate the company has seen in recent years.","Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) has grown its earnings well over the last few years, and pays a strong dividend, traits which may attract some investors. In addition, multiple analysts have focused on qualitative factors when reviewing the company. For example, Seeking Alpha contributor Philip Mause believes the market is making unrealistic assumptions about the company, while Akshansh Gandhi recently wrote that the company's acquisitions will propel it long-term. These are great factors to consider in the final stages of an investment decision, but first one must use quantitative metrics to determine the company's intrinsic value.Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.Defensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 6/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 5/5Valuation SummaryKey DataBalance SheetEarnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend History Free Cash Flow ConclusionWestern Digital Corporation passes the initial requirements of both the Defensive Investor and the Enterprising Investor. The Defensive Investor is only concerned by the short dividend history, while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns. As a result, all value investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to that valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, it has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $3.71 in 2011 to an estimated $5.80 for 2015. This is a fairly strong level of demonstrated growth and outpaces the market's implied estimate for annual earnings growth of 2.53% over the next 7-10 years.In recent years, the company's actual growth in EPSmg has averaged around 11.29% annually, and while the ModernGraham valuation model reduces the actual growth to a more conservative figure when making an estimate, the model still returns an estimate of intrinsic value well above the current price, indicating that Western Digital Corporation is significantly undervalued at the present time."
3500056,23757,2015-09-09T17:27:30-04:00,"The NAND flash industry is highly cyclical due to fierce competition, similar to the hard drive industry a decade ago.Industry consolidation made the hard drive industry stable.SanDisk and Micron will be attractive when the flash industry consolidates like the hard drive industry.","SanDisk (SNDK) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) have both fallen almost 50% from their highs of about a year ago and may seem like attractive investments now. In fact, we owned SanDisk for awhile a few years ago. We sold out because we felt that even though the company was operating in the rapidly growing flash storage market the industry was still very cyclical and boy did we turn out to be right.Right now the NAND flash memory market consists of seven major players. The chart below shows each company and its corresponding market share as of 2015.With the NAND flash memory market forecast to grow 12% this year and projected to continue growing at double digit rates for years after you would think investing in SanDisk or Micron now at a 50% discount should be a slam dunk.The problem is the industries extreme cyclicality. With cyclical industries companies tend to flood the market with product when demand is strong, with the market oversupplied prices drop significantly, companies cut back on production, then prices rise due to tight supplies and the whole cycle repeats itself. This cyclicality makes it hard to predict what a company's margins will look like from year to year or even quarter to quarter.The graphs below show SanDisk and Micron's gross margins and operating margins respectively over almost the past two decades.As you can see margins are all over the place and fluctuate greatly even during non recessionary periods. With margins varying from losing money in some years to almost doubling in others it is almost impossible to value either company with a high degree of certainty. So what can an investor do?When to Invest in SanDisk and MicronThe situation with the NAND flash memory companies reminds us of the same environment hard disk manufacturers operated in (in the interest of full disclosure we also owned WDC in the past).Decades ago the hard drive industry consisted of at least a dozen major players such as NEC, DEC, Maxtor, IBM (NYSE:IBM), Samsung, Hitachi, Fujitsu, JVC, Memorex, Toshiba, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX). After many years of consolidation the industry has been reduced to two major players, Western Digital with 43% of the market and Seagate with 40%, and a distant also ran in Toshiba with 17% of the market.The effect the industry consolidation on margins has been remarkable. The two graphs below show gross margins and operating margins for Seagate and Western Digital respectively.As you can see as the industry consolidated margins began to stabilize. In 2009 Fujitsu sold its hard drive operations to Toshiba reducing the number of industry players to four. Then in 2011 Western Digital purchased Hitachi's hard drive operations reducing the industry to three companies. It was during this time period that we can see gross margins really begin to show a lot of stability. However, due to the disruption caused by the Thailand floods in 2011 there is still some variability. The trend toward consolidation has culminated in margins remaining fairly steady for WDC and STX over the past four to five years.SummaryThe long term future of storage is definitely NAND flash memory. While traditional magnetic hard drives still have a place today where massive amounts of information need to be stored it would be foolish to bet against progress. Technology, invention, and innovation will bring down the price of NAND flash storage to a point where it eventually supplants traditional magnetic hard drives in most applications. I have no idea when that will be but industry growth for Micron and SanDisk is almost certain. The question then is when do the stocks become attractive investments?Notice I said investments. Because of the cyclical nature of the flash industry the stocks will likely have wild swings and anyone who can time the flash memory industry cycle properly will probably be able to make a substantial amount of money. What I'm after is when do the stocks become attractive enough to be a buy and hold investment and not just a trading instrument?Right now there are seven major competitors in the industry. With hard drive manufacturers we only really saw industry cyclicality become a minor factor and margins improve when the industry consolidated to four major players. Once the flash memory industry consolidates to three or four major players SanDisk and Micron may be worth a look as long term investments. For now investors should stay on the sidelines and let the traders try to time the industry's cycles."
3352145,86896,2015-07-23T17:53:56-04:00,"SanDisk delivered a surprise Q2 earnings beat to shareholders and the stock is flying.Overall year to year performance is not showing positive results. The business has to create growth to maintain positive earnings results.The loss of a major customer, decreasing cash, less than exciting revenue trends, out of sync costs, and competition are all reasons this climb won't last long term.","SanDisk (SNDK) is up big. The company reported a Q2 earnings beat and stock is up 17% as I write this. $0.66 a share versus estimates of $0.33 a share is a great surprise. There is no doubt about it. I'm sure shareholders are thrilled. That being said, I don't see this earnings beat as any reason to jump onto the SanDisk bandwagon just yet. Behind the celebration, there are some causes for concern.For one, revenues are down 24% from Q2 2014. That's a real problem. It is a continuation in a trending history of shaky revenues for the company. If you look at their numbers, their costs are not being appropriately managed to their changes in business.For two quarters in a row Sandisks cost of revenue has been out of sink with its revenue stream. You can't have Q4'14 revenue decreases while your costs increase 7%. The 23% decline in revenues from Q4 to Q1 is also a concerning factor.Consider the firm's balance sheet.Assets are shrinking. Technically that's not always a terrible thing. GM (NYSE:GM) is way smaller than it used to be, and that's helped it out tremendously. It is however vexing to investors when liabilities actually increase as assets diminish. Such is the case on 9/28/2014.Sandisk's second quarter revenue decline is being cited as due to competitive pricing pressure and an unfavorable product mix. Those aren't problems that just go away. If pricing pressure is having a consistent toll on Sandisk's sales, then something really needs to change. Sure they may be able to keep up earnings for awhile, but eventually this is going to hit a wall. It's pretty tough to keep losing revenues and maintain growing earnings per share whilst your costs and liabilities aren't adapting.Overall, the company delivered a good quarter to those already invested. The year-over-year comparisons are not attractive to me and there are many reasons to feel uneasy. Sandisk lost a major customer form their commercial channels; which represent over 60% of their revenues, gross profit is down almost 30% from the same quarter the year prior, and operating expenses increased. Sandisk is in a very competitive business and is developing a trend of diminishing performance. Unless you already own it, I don't see the appeal at this time."
3374735,24663,2015-07-30T09:29:45-04:00,"WDC is trading higher after poor earnings and weak guidance.
        This suggests that shareholders believe WDC is cheap enough.
        Further, investors are buying for WDC's dividend and buybacks.","Apparently, neither investors nor analysts read Western Digital's (NASDAQ:WDC) fiscal fourth quarter (calendar second quarter) earnings report. The company missed both top and bottom line expectations, and then issued light revenue and EPS guidance in an industry that's showing no signs of light at the end of a dark tunnel. Yet, somehow, Western Digital's stock is higher by 5% in after hours trading. This proves just one thing.For Western Digital to have jumped higher by 5.5% after reporting that quarter, it tells me that shares have been beat down to a point where shareholders just see value. Western Digital is a company that sells storage for PCs, laptops, smartphones, tablets, data centers, etc., mostly in the hard disk drive (HDD) space where it controls about 45% of the market. While PC-related revenue is no longer as big of a drag on Western Digital's business as it once was, fact of the matter is that the company's largest single growth driver derives from an industry where shipments declined almost 10% year-over-year during the second quarter, PCs.Despite the PC industry's struggle, Western Digital has solidified itself in an enormous HDD market, a high margin industry that has allowed the company to be very shareholder friendly over the years. Looking ahead, Western Digital will pay a forward dividend yield of 2.6%, better than the SPDR S&P 500 ETF's (NYSEARCA:SPY) 2% yield. In other words, Western Digital is a high-yield investment.Furthermore, Western Digital buys back stock with authority. Over the last year Western Digital spent $1.4 billion of its $2.2 billion of operating cash flow to buyback stock and pay dividends. With about 230 million shares outstanding, Western Digital spent about $450 million on dividends. That leaves nearly $1 billion for dividends, and for an $18 billion company, that's a rather aggressive buyback strategy.With that said, Western Digital clearly did not have the earnings strength to support a surging stock. However, the fact that Western Digital's stock is trading higher tells me that investors are using the earnings as an opportunity to get back into a company that pays a solid dividend and buys back stock vigorously. After all, if you remove the company's $5 billion in cash & equivalents, Western Digital trades at just 8x next year's earnings. That's really cheap, so much that it leaves limited downside for the stock. It's that realization that has the stock trading higher, not the company's poor earnings, as investors are betting that its near 30% loss this year is nearing an end. And given its dividend, buybacks, and valuation, I tend to agree."
3571696,92916,2015-10-14T12:01:22-04:00,Micron is unlikely to be the highest bidder for SanDisk because Micron only wants SanDisk's fab capacity. SanDisk IP presents little value for Micron.Western Digital could find a way to pivot out of the dying HDD market with an acquisition of SanDisk and find itself with a huge technological lead over rival Seagate.SK Hynix should also be considered a potential suitor for SanDisk. SanDisk needs DRAM and Hynix needs better NAND. It's a good match.Hynix and SanDisk are both developing costly 3D NAND and next generation NVM solutions. A merger could significantly reduce costs as all efforts could be focused on a single product.,"SanDisk (SNDK) has been the subject of numerous rumors as an acquisition target for quite a while now. Recent rumors have centered around either Micron (NASDAQ:MU) or Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) acquiring the NAND leader headed by one of the most recognized names in NVM (Non-Volatile Memory), Sanjay Mehrotra.I wrote an article that suggested the paired trade of long Micron and short SNDK, but I have remained purely long Micron while remaining on the sidelines on SanDisk for now. While I am convinced that Micron's prospects are phenomenal, I am far less certain on what lies ahead for SanDisk.In my prior article, I believed SanDisk would lose its cost advantage in NAND once Micron starts producing 3D NAND and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) advanced another generation in its version of 3D NAND. Because of its lack of access to cheap DRAM, coupled with its loss of cost superiority in NAND, SanDisk seemed destined to be shut out of the rapidly growing smartphone MCP market. SanDisk is also likely far behind Micron (and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)) in developing a next-generation non-volatile memory. Micron and Intel will have 3D XPoint products out in 2016. SanDisk has just recently formed an alliance with HP (NYSE:HPQ) that is attempting to create a next generation NVM that has similar performance specs to that of XPoint. Realistically, the SanDisk team is at least 2-3 years behind Micron and Intel right now. The gap might even be larger than that. I hypothesize that Samsung and SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) are at roughly the same juncture in the development of their respective responses to XPoint.It is desirable for Micron to acquire SanDisk. However, the deal would have to be at a price that makes sense for Micron. At around $70/share ($14 billion market cap), the math doesn't add up to me. SanDisk and its joint venture partner Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) share 525,000 300 mm wafers per month of capacity as of the end of 2014. Roughly half of the capacity belongs to SanDisk and the remainder belongs to Toshiba. That is about 262,500 wafers/month of capacity per month for SanDisk. While this is highly simplifying the value of a wafer, SanDisk is trading at a valuation of around $53,000 per wafer per month. Micron had an effective capacity of 627,000 wafers per month at the end of 2014. Micron is trading at roughly $31,000 per wafer per month. Micron is trading at a discount to SanDisk in terms of trailing 12-month P/E, P/Sales, Price/EBITDA, Price/FCF or any other metric you want to look at.I believe Micron should be trading at premium valuations relative to SanDisk because of its far superior technology roadmap. Therefore, I believe Micron making a (realistic) deal with SanDisk by issuing new shares of Micron stock in an acquisition is unacceptable, as Micron should be valued significantly higher than SanDisk on a relative basis right now. However, this does not rule out the possibility of a deal where Micron makes an acquisition with mostly cash. This is where Tsinghua Unigroup could find an opening into the memory oligopoly. Micron's cost of debt is high and would get much higher if it raised cash to buy SanDisk. Tsinghua Unigroup could include very generous loan terms as part of a future joint venture.There is one major reason why I believe a Micron acquisition of SanDisk is unlikely to beat out bids from other suitors. While Micron would love to expand its market share in the memory oligopoly without increasing worldwide wafer capacity, the Idaho-based memory manufacturer likely does not highly value SanDisk's intellectual property. SanDisk's next generation NVM solution is essentially worthless to Micron. Micron and Intel seem convinced they have the right architecture for 3D NAND and that would imply that SanDisk's BiCS has very little value to Micron as well. Cheap planar NAND is nice, but it is a virtual certainty that the end of planar NAND is coming soon. Further complicating a potential Micron deal is SanDisk's joint venture with Toshiba. SanDisk and Toshiba's joint ventures include provisions such as ""exclusivity, transfer restrictions and limited termination rights."" (I hope a lawyer will parse out what he thinks that means in the comments below.) Because Micron is only interested in SanDisk's wafer capacity, other potential acquirers should be willing to make higher bids as both the fab capacity and the intellectual property of SanDisk will provide meaningful value. Companies that fit this acquirer profile include Western Digital, SK Hynix and Tsinghua Unigroup. Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Toshiba should be considered very long shots at best as potential acquirers of SanDisk right now.A Western Digital acquisition of SanDisk stands a greater chance of happening than a Micron one. The bread and butter of Western Digital (and Seagate), HDDs (Hard Disk Drives) are going to eventually be completely replaced by SSDs (Solid State Drives). It is not a question of if, but a question of when. This is almost certainly going to happen within a decade and it could happen much sooner than that. Because of this significant technology transition, Western Digital should be scrambling to find a foothold outside of HDDs. The natural place is obviously SSDs, which stores data on non-volatile memory dies (NAND). There are only four major manufacturers on NAND in the world: Samsung, SK Hynix, Micron and SanDisk. Samsung has no interest in selling to Western Digital (for obvious reasons). Micron (with its partner Intel) is much more likely to want to compete and attempt to kill off Western Digital rather than sell itself to a HDD manufacturer. A SK Hynix deal seems plausible but more complicated (as Hynix is involved in businesses outside of NAND that may not be of strategic value to Western Digital). That leaves SanDisk as the best acquisition target for the HDD giant.Western Digital has virtually no presence in NAND right now. It has no fabs that produce wafers of NAND. It also does not have the intellectual property (and licenses) to produce NAND. SanDisk is possibly the answer to Western Digital's SSD prayers. SanDisk is a nice to have for Micron but is much closer to a must have for Western Digital's survival in the post-HDD era. From a regulatory perspective, a Micron acquisition of SanDisk would increase the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of the memory industry to potentially unpalatable levels while a Western Digital acquisition will likely create a company that is a stronger competitor. While I ultimately believe a Micron-SanDisk deal would go through (with some hiccups), a Western Digital-SanDisk merger is unlikely to raise significant objections from the DOJ, FTC and other government agencies.The recent Bloomberg report did not mention SK Hynix as a potential SanDisk acquirer. However, I believe the Korean memory company and Western Digital are clearly the two who should most covet SanDisk. SanDisk produces no DRAM and will find itself locked out of the smartphone MCP market in the near future as a stand-alone entity. SK Hynix controls a large share of the DRAM market but has a relatively weak position in NAND. Like SanDisk, Hynix is also likely at least 2-3 years behind Micron and Intel in the development of a next-generation non-volatile memory. A merger of SK Hynix and SanDisk will create a company that is at least viable in the smartphone MCP market. SK Hynix could drop its independent 3D NAND development and focus its collective efforts on BiCS. The two companies are currently far behind in creating a XPoint-like product. However, the two could jointly (with HP) develop a next generation NVM (and potentially halve the R&D cost of creating two separate solutions). Hynix gets to increase its capacity without increasing worldwide capacity. That is good for the memory oligopoly. A net result of a Hynix and SanDisk deal would leave the memory oligopoly with just three players. The weakest two of the four memory manufacturers (Hynix and SanDisk) combining will create a more formidable company that would gain influence in the memory oligopoly. Toshiba would also likely not complain about the prospects of an alliance with SK Hynix.Tsinghua Unigroup is obviously interested in breaking into the memory market. Rumors of a Micron bid along with Tsinghua's investment in Western Digital (via Unisplendour) and the hiring of a key executive of the Nanya and Micron joint venture are clear signs that the Chinese firm is willing to make large investments immediately. SanDisk seems to be putting itself on the auction block and Tsinghua is in the buying mood for everything in semiconductors. However, Tsinghua Unigroup Chairman Zhao Weiguo has stated his firm has no plans to acquire SanDisk. (He also stated Tsinghua is not looking to acquire Toshiba or SK Hynix as well.) To further complicate a theoretical Tsinghua-SanDisk merger, the same anti-China outcry from the American political machine that opposed a possible Tsinghua-Micron deal would likely be loud and troublesome. It seems unlikely the US government would give its blessings for a China-SanDisk deal.In the case of Seagate, you can go through my article and replace Western Digital with Seagate. It basically makes sense for Seagate to also want to acquire SanDisk for the same reasons Western Digital would. I don't see a Toshiba deal as likely, but a Toshiba-SanDisk deal would effectively double Toshiba's presence in the memory industry and keep its engineering teams intact and out of the hands of competitors.In summary, I see a Micron-SanDisk deal as highly unlikely. There is a far higher chance that Western Digital or SK Hynix will acquire SanDisk. There's also probably a higher chance that Seagate or Toshiba gets involved in a SanDisk acquisition bidding war before Micron gets a chance to scoop up SanDisk. I am long Micron, but I will likely look to sell a (small) portion of my shares if it acquires SanDisk. (I am under the impression that Micron will likely be overpaying if it acquires SanDisk.) For now, I'm avoiding the buy Micron-short SanDisk paired trade, but I would certainly look at a possible buy Micron-short Western Digital paired trade in the future (if Western Digital acquires SanDisk.) The best trade in my opinion in this space now is just to simply be long Micron for the long haul.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Moreover, I stated that I expected revenue for key technologies such as SSD to continue to grow strongly after having previously risen by 170 percent.However, the company has since fallen quite dramatically after revenue disappointments and lower than expected earnings in Q1 2015 led to a fall in price to a level of $55.39 at the time of writing:Source: investing.comAt this point, an investor who initiates a position in SanDisk will either be buying the dip or catching a falling knife. So, which one will it be? The answer to this question largely depends on whether the fall in revenues and earnings is simply a one-off and markets have overreacted, or if this marks the start of diminishing demand for SanDisk technologies, in which case further losses cannot be ruled out. In my previous article, I had used the dividend discount model to argue that on aggregate SanDisk would need to grow earnings and dividends by 10 percent year-on-year to maintain the then target price range of $95-105, and 20 percent for the stock to appreciate to a target price of $140-150.Source: Author's CalculationsAt the current price, an appreciation back up to the $95 level would still mark fantastic returns for an investor who chooses to get in at this point. In this regard, I choose to focus on whether this is still achievable in light of recent events. While SSD had seen dramatic growth leading up to 2014, the company is expecting revenues to remain in line with that of 2014 at approximately $1.9 billion. In particular, increased competition from players such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), coupled with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) switching to Samsung for SSD sourcing, means that SSD demand is unlikely to grow at previous rates.However, the company has continued to be innovative and with a 200GB Micro SD Card having been launched last June earnings performance on July 22 will be a big indicator as to whether SanDisk will be successful at boosting its earnings in spite of lower SSD sales. Currently, analysts have an expected earnings target of $0.34 per share on the stock. While earnings for 2015 will likely not match that of 2014 given weak performance in the first quarter, the company could well see upside from here should estimates come in higher than expected. Should we then see a 10 percent appreciation year-on-year from 2016 onwards, then a target price of $85-90 is not unrealistic.To conclude, earnings performance on July 22 will be a big indicator as to how SanDisk will perform going forward. The challenge for the company is to now prove that it can continue to grow revenues in spite of SSD sales flattening out. Should earnings come in higher than expected, then I would take a bullish view on the company and this would mark a potentially attractive entry point."
3502876,25265,2015-09-11T15:19:58-04:00,"When Western Digital purchased Hitachi's hard drive business in 2012, it was required by Chinese regulators to keep it separate from WDC operations.This has kept operating expenses at Western Digital artificially high.The company is currently appealing this ruling and awaiting a response.A positive settlement could mean big profits for Western Digital shareholders.","Background:On March 8, 2012, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) completed the acquisition of Hitachi's hard drive drive (HDD) business for ~$4.7B. A few months earlier Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) closed on a deal to purchase Samsung's HDD business. Combined, these deals served to effectively create a near perfect duopoly in the global HDD supplier category. I say near perfect because Toshiba also is in this business but their market share is only 10%-15% and they principally produce only on the low-end (i.e., PC drives). When Western Digital gained regulatory approval to purchase Hitachi's HDD business it did so under one major condition from European and U.S. regulators - it would have to divest Hitachi's 3.5"" (desktop size HDDs) business. Western Digital complied by selling this business to Toshiba. Today both Seagate and Western Digital control about 85%-90% of the world's supply of HDDs. This duolopy has been very effective in keeping margins elevated and consistent.Source: Company earnings press releasesHere you can see that pre-consolidation gross margins were in the 18%-20% range. Post-consolidation gross margins for the two companies have consistently been in the 27%-30% range. The even higher margins in 2012 were the result of severe flooding in Thailand that took many of Western Digital's factories off-line for several months. Supply was extremely tight during that period, so gross margins climbed above 30% for a few quarters. I'd also note that this is GAAP gross margin. The companies typically report non-GAAP margin as well, which is a bit higher as it excludes certain one-time items and non-cash amortization expense. Overall industry consolidation has done wonders for profitability for both Western Digital and Seagate. The two effectively keep prices high without ever actually speaking to one other. It's a great model as long both continue to act in a profit maximization manner and do not over produce.But there is more to the story for Western Digital. When the company received approval to purchase the Hitachi HDD business, it had to agree to one major condition set forth by China's Anti-Monopoly Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). MOFCOM stated that Western Digital must hold the entire Hitachi HDD business separate, so as to maintain it as a viable independent competitor in the HDD market. Specifically, MOFCOM required that the Hitachi business maintain its independence in R&D, production, procurement, marketing, after-sales service, administration, finance, investment and personnel appointment. Further, walls must be established to prevent the exchange of competitively sensitive information between Western Digital and Hitachi. Overall, the restrictions are pretty extensive and greatly impact the cash costs at Western Digital. By how much? Western Digital addressed this question during the Q&A on the last earnings call. Here is the exchange between the CFO and an analyst with Morgan Stanley:The company puts potential cost savings from the full integration of Hitachi operations at $400M-plus a year. Just to put that in context, free cash flow for the fiscal year that just ended on June 30 was $1.6B. So a reversal of the MOFCOM restrictions would be extremely beneficial to the company and its investors. It would provide increased financial flexibility, which the company could use to make acquisitions, return to shareholders or reduce debt.The MOFCOM restrictions do not seem to be very effective. Gross margins have been maintained 700-1000 basis points above pre-industry consolidation levels for several years now. The two companies are still essentially acting as one. So what exactly is the point of maintaining these restrictions on Western Digital and Hitachi operations? WDC's management wonders the same thing. Twenty-four months after MOFCOM's decision Western Digital was allowed to apply to MOFCOM for removal of the restrictions. We have now passed that anniversary and the company has indeed asked for the restrictions to be lifted. This topic is addressed on pretty much every WDC earnings call. Here are the CEO's comments on the subject on the Q4 (June 30) earnings call.So I believe management is doing its best to plead its case to Chinese regulators. When will a decision be announced? During the same earnings call the CEO has this to say with regard to timing:So there you have it. The company believes it should have a decision one way or another by the end of the year. A positive decision would obviously be great for both the company and its shareholders. An instant 25%-plus increase to free cash flow could move the stock higher by 25% if you assume the same trading multiple on free cash flow. A negative decision likely won't be too detrimental to the stock price as it already trades in-line with the valuation of its competitor Seagate.Odds of SuccessSo what are the odds that MOFCOM will be sympathetic to Western Digital's plight and lift the restrictions on its Hitachi operations? That is pretty difficult to handicap. While I do not believe the separation of WDC and Hitachi has been particularly effective from a consumer benefit perspective, I also don't think MOFCOM cares very much about WDC saving $400M-plus, particularly when it could come at the expense of Chinese jobs. I also doubt this decision is very high on MOFCOM's to-do list right now. I can see the decision being delayed past year-end. However the risk vs. reward is skewed to the upside for WDC if you believe HDDs are still a viable medium of electronic storage. A negative outcome is likely neutral to slightly negative for the stock as a few investors may own it solely on the belief that a positive ruling will be announced. A positive outcome will be highly beneficial to shareholders. The stock could rise 25% or more.Brean Capital is likely the most bullish sell side firm on the stock - believing that a positive MOFCOM settlement could add as much as $60 to WDC s stock price. I believe Brean's estimates are significantly too optimistic, as it assumes a 15x EPS multiple - which is typically a peak multiple for a hardware company. I believe that multiple is unlikely to happen and, if it does, it won't be sustainable.Even still I like the risk versus reward here into year-end. I think PC sales should stabilize into year-end with the release of Windows 10 and the holiday selling season. Western Digital stock is down 25% year to date. The industry is very cyclical but there is no doubt flash is gaining in laptop penetration. Even still, the company is moving into flash itself and is on a $1B revenue run rate for solid state drives (SSDs) already. It also is moving up the value chain and offering complete network storage solutions. Finally, new end market demand is emerging for cheap storage in areas such as surveillance and 3D printing. For these reasons, I believe the demise of WDC is greatly exaggerated. I think the stock has hit a bottom and headed for a bit of an upswing. A positive MOFCOM settlement would accelerate the momentum to the upside, potentially giving investors a nice return going into year-end."

This was one of the headwinds identified by the company that is now beginning to subside and perhaps evolve into a tailwind with better and more disciplined supply and demand industry conditions. SanDisk's SSD revenue mix has become more diversified over the year with a growing base of enterprise SSD and embedded solutions. The 8% increment in enterprise revenue mix in a year is impressive and the company is fast catching up to dominant players such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in terms of market share. However, despite all these factors, the effect of margins on earnings takes time to be realized and does not impose immediate effects on the bottom line.Source: Company ReportsStrong Macro TrendsSanDisk is more than benefiting from the growth in data centers and the shift from HDDs over to SSDs. Overtime the advantages of SSDs are becoming clearer to consumers and businesses as noted by the shift in demand from HDDs to SSDs. There is no doubt SanDisk is one of the company's well positioned to capture the fast growing Internet of Things market. However, despite strong macro trends and evolving technology, the company is facing competitive, executional and short term market weakness that potentially affects their revenue growth in this quarter.Source: Company ReportsConstrained Enterprise SSD MarketSanDisk's Enterprise SSD solutions business segment has a tendency to provide lumpy revenues and following Intel's latest earnings release suggests that the enterprise market is not growing as fast as expected in this quarter. Intel has about 25% market share in enterprise SSD and their Data Center business quarterly growth has slowed down to 10%, below the 15% annual growth expectations. Furthermore, SanDisk has stated that in their previous quarter they were facing supply constraints and were unable to meet the demands of one of their hyper-scale customers.Source: SanDisk Q1 Earnings Results. SA Transcripts.It is unlikely that SanDisk will be able to add on sufficient production capacity in the short term due to the time required to convert or upgrade their existing fabs, and that's assuming that the company has spare capacity for additional production ramps. This represents a loss in market share but more importantly identifies weaknesses in their ability to scale production capacities fast enough to meet market demands (although understandable due to the shift towards 3D). Future clients may even turn towards competitors to provide for their enterprise needs seeing the production limitations that SanDisk has. Management is also less upbeat about their sales expectations:Source: SanDisk Q1 Earnings Results. SA TranscriptsWeak Client SSD MarketSanDisk's client SSD outlook, 13% of their revenue, was affected by the loss of a major customer in the previous quarter, Apple. In addition, the weak first half PC market has affected the earnings of several companies including competitors such as Micron and Intel. SanDisk is not immune to the downsides of the weaker than expected PC market and I expect this to be reflected in their earnings release. The PC encompasses an entire ecosystem of products, SSDs, HDDs, DRAMs, Processors, weakness in the sector leaves no company that has a significant share in it untouched. Although I do believe in the second half rebound in the PC due to the release of Windows 10 and Intel Skylake, I am hyper sensitive and risk averse towards the earnings effect on SanDisk.Mature Removable Storage MarketThe removable storage market is a mature market and SanDisk is slowly diversifying their revenue away from it to realize higher growth margins and perhaps even volumes in the other segments of the NAND flash industry. However, removable storage product sales have fallen 17% yoy in the previous quarter and it is unlikely that we see a pick-up in sales in this quarter due to product maturity. There is also no underlying evidence to support a bump in removable storage solutions sales.Exchange Rate RisksSanDisk is also facing increasing exchange rate risks. A good 38.4% of their revenue is from Asia Pacific, 13.43% from EMEA and another 29.44% in other foreign countries. In total, 81.27% of revenue is outside of North America. The strong US dollar will have a significant effect on their earnings give their strong international presence.Source: csimarket.comConclusionIn total, about 27% of their revenues are affected by supply constraints and weaker than expected PC market. The removable storage, which is about 38% of their revenue, is a mature market that is in decline. About 80% of revenue is exposed to the strong US dollar and this also affects their overall profitability. Given that current headwinds are stronger than existing tailwinds, SanDisk is unlikely to provide an earnings surprise."

The stock is sitting near 52-week lows after two consecutive disappointing earnings reports.SanDisk's poor performance over the past two quarters is attributable to the convergence of weak demand and supply chain issues. In addition, SanDisk has referenced the loss of a significant customer, rumored to be Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). A perfect storm hit SanDisk over the past two quarters, but how did those trends behave in the current quarter?PC sales are estimated to have fallen about 9.5% in the current quarter YoY. PC sales have a significant impact on SanDisk's revenues in their removable and SSD segments. As of the most recent quarter, the removable and SSD segments were 65% of SanDisk's revenue. In Q1, removable revenue fell 16.3% and SSD revenue fell 15% while PC sales as a whole fell 5.2% YoY. SanDisk's sales decline outpaced that of the PC market because of supply issues. More specifically, in the company's Q1 earnings call executives cited supply chain issues in both the embedded and SSD segments. CFO Judy Brenner stated that Sandisk ""encountered qualification delays for (an) embedded component, which resulted in a larger than expected sequential decline in embedded revenue."" In addition to supply issues with embedded products, CEO Sanjay Mehrotra stated that they were unable to deliver a SSD product to a ""large hyper-scale customer in enterprise SATA."" While the company acknowledged that they expect some supply issues to continue into Q2, there was no indication that the situation would worsen, yet analysts are projecting the divergence between SanDisk's revenue decline and the PC sales decline to widen in Q2. We believe that analysts are overestimating SanDisk's decline in the upcoming quarter.While we are more optimistic than most on SanDisk's current quarterly performance, we do not see long-term value in the company's stock. SanDisk's free cash flows declined from FY2013 to FY2014 due to contracting operating cash flows. That trend continued into the first quarter of FY2015, as free cash flows fell around 39.5% YoY. SanDisk's valuation also appears inflated. SanDisk currently trades at 1.79x PSR versus .49x PSR for competitor Sony (NYSE:SNE) and 1.32x for the industry. Analysts are expecting EPS to grow 56.2% over the next year, which is an extremely quick turnaround after EPS fell from $1.14 in Q1 FY2014 to $0.17 in Q1 FY2015.Too many things have to turn around for SanDisk to become an attractive long-term investment. While we are more optimistic than most about their upcoming quarterly report, we believe the current valuation to be counting on too quick of a turnaround."

On the contrary, the demand for Solid State Drives is increasing substantially, and with the reduction in cost per GB this trend is expected to continue. By 2016, the market is expected to be valued at over $20 billion. According to iSuppli, unit shipments of SSDs are expected to reach 239 million, holding about 40% of the hard disk drive market.Western Digital has a solid presence in the SDD market thanks to several acquisitions that it completed in 2013. The company acquired SSD maker sTec, enterprise flash storage company Virident Systems and storage optimization software company Velobit in 2013 to expand its presence in the SDD market. The company's initiatives have paid off nicely as Enterprise Solid State Drive segment revenue jumped from $134 million in the year-ago quarter to $244 million. Given the expected growth of the SDD market, Western Digital's increasing presence will act as a long-term tailwind.Active archive systems is a significant tailwindActive archive systems for unstructured data storage and retrieval can also act as another long-term growth driver for Western Digital. Unstructured data is growing at fast pace and by the end of 2020, the digital universe will have over 44 trillion gigabytes.According to an IDC report, last year, roughly 90% of data storage needs were for unstructured data. As part of its vertical integration and growth plan, and to pursue growth through active archive storage market, Western Digital acquired Amplidata, an essential building block for active archive systems. The company said:""Amplidata's Himalaya software is a versatile platform for massively-scalable, secure and flexible storage services and solutions. It allows customers to store and manage exabytes of data and trillions of stored objects, representing an exponential leap in scale that anticipates rapid growth in customers' appetite for highly durable and available storage.""During the quarter, the company shipped its first active archive system, a new category of high value-added archival storage product. The system delivers 4.7 petabytes (PB) of raw data storage in a single rack. This active archive storage market, valued at approximately $15 billion this year, is projected to grow to $22 billion by 2017. So, the acquisition of Amplidata bodes well for Western Digital and can benefit the company in the long-run.Enterprise storage market is importantTechnavio's analysts forecast that the video surveillance market will grow at a CAGR of 14.63% over the period 2014-2019. This provides an excellent growth opportunity for Western Digital. The company is looking to make the most of this growth as it recently released four new models of high-performance NAS systems for the SMB space, especially for the fast-expanding surveillance video recording market.For the Enterprise space, the company launched the new Ultrastar MPME solutions that address the industry's transition to standards-based PCIE solutions. Western Digital surpassed 1 million helium hard drive deployments and is now ramping up the new eight terabyte helium PMR sealed drives.Final takeWestern Digital has been struggling over the last few months as the stock is down roughly 20% YTD. The company posted weak quarterly results, and the guidance for the next quarter also is soft. It's clear that macroeconomic headwinds and a decline in PC sales has taken its toll on Western Digital.However, the company is making the right moves to offset this downturn. The company has made good moves in the non-PC segments and also is expanding exposure to the small and medium business space. I believe most of the concerns are already priced in the stock. Also, the current valuation doesn't take into account the robust enterprise and cloud demand where Western Digital is upping its game.Western Digital currently trades at 13x trailing earnings and has a forward P/E of 10.8. This is cheap as I believe the headwinds have already been priced in present value. In addition, the company also has a strong balance sheet with cash of $5.04 billion vs. debt of $2.34 billion. Western Digital's acquisitions have been successful, and the company certainly has the cash to acquire more companies to propel growth. I think Western Digital is a strong buy on the pullback."

They have each had major pull backs in the last few months. Friday, STX closed at $45.95 (its 52-week high was $69.40) and WDC closed at $77.10 (its 52-week high was $114.69). Both stocks are often described as ""disk drive"" companies although changes in the technology definitely indicate that ""data storage"" is a more accurate description. Both companies have fiscal years ending in June so that they are reasonably easy to compare.The history of their business is complex and can be misleading. For a very long time, the disk drive business was fiercely competitive with prices constantly declining as drives with more and more capacity on less and less space kept coming out. The business was also fragmented and price competition was intense. A few years ago, STX and WDC each made a large acquisition and when the dust settled, the two of them controlled roughly 90% of the market. Since then, they have become cash flow machines generating huge amounts of cash and using a great deal of it for dividends and share repurchases.Ever since I started following these stocks, there has always been an undercurrent of concern that the business may become technologically obsolescent due to new technologies. I am sure that this article will provoke comments of that type and that the comment stream will devolve into technologically complex discussions of various emerging threats to their business. Indeed, one of the most reliable financial headlines (after ""Greek Financial Situation Deteriorates"" and ""Venezuelans Line Up to Buy Toilet Paper"") has been ""Disk Drive Companies Face Massive Competitive Threat."" This perception explains the current pricing of these stocks.The reality is that the anticipated decline has never really materialized. WDC and - perhaps to a lesser extent - STX seem to be involved in the solid state technology which is picking up a bigger share of storage and they each certainly have the cash flow to make the acquisitions and investments to keep up with technological advances. I do not think that this will be a replay of what happened to American television manufacturers when solid state technology from Japan suddenly swept the market and left them high and dry.The stocks have become so cheap that the market is now pricing in substantial and sustained declines in the business. The table below provides - for each company - per share cash flow, net cash, enterprise value and the enterprise value/cash flow ratio. The numbers are based on SEC filings and include an annualization of the nine months (already reported) of the current fiscal year. I prefer using cash flow because each of the companies has a big depreciation deduction.STX has net debt so that its net cash number is negative. Each of the companies is gushing cash. STX has reduced share count from 463 million to 330 million over the past three years. WDC's share count reduction has been less dramatic (from 245 million to 231 million over the past two years). In each case, share repurchases may start ramping up due to these depressed prices. Each company pays a reasonable dividend (WDC yields 2.6% and STX yields 4.7%) and the cash flow as calculated above clearly creates the opportunity for substantial dividend increases going forward.Each company's fortunes are - to a degree - tied to the troubled PC market because they make substantial sales in the PC OEM market and we may be in a lull for the next quarter or two due to a pending software release this Fall which could pick up sales and revenue later in the year. In this market, there are not many opportunities to pick up assets generating after-tax cash flow of 14 or 15% of the amount invested. Unless something very, very bad is about to happen very, very soon, these stocks will reward investors handsomely. I really don't see a sufficiently ominous cloud on the horizon to justify these low valuations.My advice to investors is to buy some of each unless you have a very strong reason to develop an opinion on which of the two will be more successful moving forward. Needless to say, I am long WDC and STX."
3314365,31441,2015-07-09T12:23:19-04:00,"Earlier this week SanDisk set a new 52-week low.I expect the company's eroding revenue and margins and lack of pricing power to continue in the near term.Loss of Apple business, an aggressive Samsung and lack of 3D NAND technology make SNDK a sell.","The biggest news in the memory chip industry has been the tug of war between Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) over market share and key clients. Meanwhile, SanDisk (SNDK) has been all but ignored. The stalwart in NAND has been reeling from a decline in volume and average sales price (""asp"") for its products. Earlier this week SNDK hit a 52-week low of $53.86.Over the past 12 months SNDK is down about 45% vs. a 7% return for the S&P 500 (SPX). However, investors should avoid the stock for the following reasons:Revenue And EBITDA Margins In Free FallIn Q1 SanDisk's revenue and EBITDA experienced sequential declines of 12% and 44%, respectively.Source: Shock Exchange, SanDisk public filingsThe decline in EBITDA outstripped the fall off in revenue as the company's EBITDA margin declined to 23% in Q1 from 37% in the year earlier period. Gross margins also fell to 41% from 50%. Revenue and EBITDA growth could erode further. Analysts expect Q2 revenue to decline another 11% to $1.19 billion from the $1.33 billion reported in Q1.Lack Of Pricing PowerEven more alarming is the company's lack of pricing power. The company's average sales price (""asp"") has declined for five consecutive quarters. Meanwhile, volume (measured by gigabytes sold) fell in two of the past five quarters.Source: SanDisk public filingsThe combination of the declining asp and declining volume amplifies the erosion of revenue and EBITDA margins. Two drivers of the phenomenon are probably the loss of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) business and an aggressive Samsung.Loss Of AppleAccording to Gartner, about 2.4 billion mobile devices (tablets, smartphones) were shipped in 2014, of which 263 million (11%) were iOS-operated devices. In Q1 Apple also ranked second to Samsung with nearly 20% of the global smartphone market. In the past SanDisk has sacrificed margins in order to appease Apple. However, in Q1 rumors surfaced that the company's SSD business with Apple had been usurped by Samsung. That partially explains [i] the stock's free fall in March from around $85 to $65, and [ii] the 15% fall off in Q1 volume.Aggressive SamsungAccording to DRAMeXchange SanDisk ranked third in Q4 2014 NAND market share behind Samsung (28% share) and Toshiba (22% share). Samsung disrupted prices in Q1 when it dumped excess NAND onto the marketplace that was left unused by its in-house smartphone division. In order to offset disappointing smartphone sales in the future, Samsung may attempt to expand in NAND, which could further impact SanDisk's asp and margins. Ultimately, Samsung has the balance sheet and the heft to control NAND prices, and that does not bode well for SanDisk.Lack Of 3D NANDIn February Seeking Alpha's Electric Phred announced Micron's expected introduction of 3D NAND and its ability to disrupt the balance of power in the marketplace:Samsung and Micron are both making inroads in mass-producing 3D NAND while SanDisk and Toshiba are not expected to bring the technology to market until 2017. DRAMeXchange projects that 3D NAND will be about 7% of total NAND flash's average annual output in 2015. If those projections are correct, SanDisk could be left with underwhelming technology it may be forced to sell at a discount to Micron or Samsung's offering. Moreover, it could cause SanDisk's revenue and margins to erode even further.ConclusionSanDisk's recent 52-week low and 16x p/e multiple are not buying opportunities. Given its lack of pricing power and deteriorating margins, SNDK may have further room to fall. Avoid this stock.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."

SanDisk has already fallen over 50% from its 52-week high of $108.77 reached a year ago in July 2014. I would not be surprised to see SanDisk fall as low as $30 over the coming weeks and months after analysts take SanDisk's 2016 revenue and EPS estimates to the woodshed.During SanDisk's Q1 conference call management has already attempted to shift investor focus from 2015 and onto 2016. My takeaway from SanDisk's Q1 call was that the ship is sinking and management is hopeful at best that fundamentals will improve by 2016. Over the last 90 days SanDisk 2015 EPS estimates have fallen by 33% ($4.23 to $2.83) while 2016 estimates have declined by 20% ($5.38 to $4.32). I'm estimating that SanDisk's 2016 earnings power is currently between $2.50 and $3.00 per share with a considerable risk for an additional down side.Image SourceI'm hard pressed to believe that SanDisk will hit 2015 EPS estimates, which also means 2016 EPS estimates will need to come down significantly. Broad market declines in memory have taught me a few lessons. The first lesson is that downturns last considerably longer than anyone expects. The second lesson I have learned is professional skepticism when it comes to organizational turnaround stories coupled with a very competitive and fairly mature industry. SandDisk's management has already acknowledged that 2015 will be very disappointing and is clearly focused on saving shareholder value by shifting investor focus ahead to 2016.However, the issue hitting SanDisk's management and investors squarely between the eyes is the company's inability to execute. It's hard to believe a management team that clearly fell asleep at the wheel during SanDisk's first quarter and is currently driving the company through a corporate strategy and product roadmap that just screams warning ""construction ahead"" to me. According to Seeking Alpha's Q1 conference call transcript SanDisk mentioned the word ""execution"" 22 times. I can tell you that you will not find one company with its act together use the word ""execution"" during its conference call. I expect SanDisk's current construction project to end up like any other construction site by taking longer than expected to turn around the business and cost more than anyone estimated in terms of customer and revenue losses.After applying a generous PE of 12 for a company that will post low single digit revenue growth in 2016 vs. 2015 a fair market value is between $30.00 and $36.00. For the record consensus revenue estimates for 2016 are $6.25B, which represent a 13% increase over 2015 revenue estimates of $5.55B (mid point of SanDisk's provided range in April).Some bulls may argue that SanDisk is a viable takeover target. I don't disagree that SanDisk is a potential takeover target, but I would not recommend writing a check for more than $50 a share over the next six months for SanDisk. SanDisk needs to undergo some major housecleaning to reduce the number of platforms, streamline its operations, integrate previous acquisitions and figure out how to execute before anyone approaches this company with a check in hand.SanDisk is a company in complete disarray that shot itself in the foot in Q1 and will continue to limp along throughout the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. SanDisk's fall from grace is a result of NAND weakness, a very competitive NAND marketplace as well as extremely poor management, inability to execute and lack of strategic planning. SanDisk's share buybacks and dividend continue to be at risk to be reduced or suspended in the coming quarters despite management's commitment to both items.Investors looking to buy the dip ahead of SanDisk's July 22nd earnings report are taking a major risk with their hard earned investment capital. I'm not recommending that investors open a short position in SanDisk, but I want investors to proceed cautiously over the coming weeks until the coast is clear and SanDisk's share price has finally reached rock bottom, likely between $30 and $36 per share."
3202576,23471,2015-05-21T10:26:24-04:00,"SNDK is suitable for Enterprising Investors following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is fairly valued at the present time.The market is implying a 6.06% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, within a margin of safety relative to the rate the company has seen in recent years.","SanDisk (SNDK) recently won a bid to provide hardware to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) watches, a fact that may lead to some speculation about the company's future earnings potential. In addition, analyst William Koldus recently posited that the company's cash flows signify great potential for value as the management leads a turnaround. These are all things to consider before investing in the company and are considerations that may attract investors.That said, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to determine a potential investment's merits. Here's an updated look at how SanDisk Corporation fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.This model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.Defensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 1/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests, or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 5/5Valuation SummaryKey DataBalance Sheet - March 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryConclusionSanDisk should satisfy the Enterprising Investor but not the Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor has multiple concerns, including the insufficient earnings growth or stability over the last ten years, the short dividend history and the high PEmg and PB ratios, while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns. Therefore, Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.From a valuation side of things, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $2.04 in 2011 to an estimated $3.24 for 2015. This level of demonstrated growth is in line with the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of 6.06% over the next 7-10 years.The company's recent earnings history shows an average annual growth in EPSmg of around 11.5%. The ModernGraham valuation model reduces such a rate to a more conservative figure, assuming some slowdown will occur, but still returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling within a margin of safety relative to the current price, indicating SanDisk is fairly valued at the present time."
3076506,24663,2015-04-16T18:35:56-04:00,"BofA recently said to buy WDC and STX ahead of earnings.The call was valuation related, as STX and WDC present value that's rarely seen in today's market.While it's hard to predict how a stock will behave after earnings, one chart proves why long term both stocks should go higher.","Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) made a valuation call on Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) earlier this week, suggesting to buy ahead of earnings due to PC weakness being priced accordingly and both stocks being cheap. The following chart proves that BofA is likely right in its analysis.Retail investors like to look at P/E ratios as a favorite valuation metric for analysis. However, free cash flow is where the identification of true value lies. A company can't manipulate FCF, it can't be inaccurately represented with one-time profit-creating events. Instead, FCF shows investors just how much money a company is creating after subtracting its capital investments.That's why it is so impressive that Seagate and Western Digital trade at 7.7 and 12.7 times FCF respectively. That said, I am not trying to predict whether or not either stock will trade higher after earnings - Seagate reports Friday - but rather that both stocks present long-term value right now.Certainly, the PC market is weak, with shipments falling 6.7% during the first quarter. However, Seagate and Western Digital have both done good at making investments in storage solutions that are non-PC related. These are two companies that earned just about all of their revenue from PC sales five years ago, but that percentage has fallen to just 50%.While Western Digital has done better at investing in solid-state drives over the last couple years, both companies are heavily exposed to high-capacity cloud drives and in data centers. Due to Seagate's insanely low FCF multiple, I peg it as the stock to own - Seagate is also one of the most shareholder-friendly companies in the market - but as explained in a recent article, it's not a bad idea to own both stocks. In other words, I agree that Western Digital and Seagate are a buy ahead of earnings, not because of an earnings day pop though, but rather an attractive valuation that should yield large returns long term."

Just a few short years ago, the industry found itself in the grips of an industry-wide meltdown, the result of vast oversupply colliding with the 2008/09 global economic crisis. As a result, a number of weaker memory industry players disappeared, and with them, much of that problematic supply glut. SanDisk (SNDK) shared in the industry's collective meltdown. However, SNDK's current travails have more to do with several company-specific operational challenges.SNDK's many operational difficulties have been taking a toll on top- and bottom-line results for the past year or so. Reflecting these concerns, the company's common stock and converts have been in freefall. In response, the company has been placating common shareholders with large buybacks. In Q1 2015, the company repurchased $750 million of stock. It will probably buy back an equal amount in the second half of the year. Fortunately, SNDK's balance sheet remains solid, and despite the aforementioned difficulties, the company remains a free cash flow generating machine. Amazing how that sometimes happens. As a result, the company can withstand the impact of the buyback initiatives, at least for the time being.Yet, SNDK's buyback efforts have failed to thus far make a difference. At $63.92, the company's stock remains trapped at the bottom of the 52-week range ($62.72-107.17). That's $9 billion in lost market value. We doubt the company's shares will begin to recover that lost value until the lingering operational problems disappear.Investment RecommendationEarlier this year (Hybrid Vigor - 01/26/15 Vol. 2 Issue 4), we recommended that investors steer a conservative course with respect to SNDK's convert issues. In particular, we suggested that investors swap out of the company's 1.50s due 2017 and into the 0.50s due 2020, thereby taking meaningful bond ""points"" off the table and insulating themselves from much of the anticipated future common trading pressure. Had they done so, they would have spared themselves over fifteen bond points of pain. Obviously, being completely out of the name would have made more sense. However, from a risk mitigation standpoint, our suggested trade made considerable sense, and it worked. So, where from here?With respect to the SNDK 1.50s due 2017, our HOCS slash line measures 46 Overall / 50 Growth / 39 Safety. In contrast, the 0.50s due 2020 weigh in at 58 Overall / 47 Growth / 79 Safety. Once again, it's the latter bond's safety score that grabs our attention. The safety-score disparity continues to be driven by the dollar-price differential (138.00 versus 100.50). Until we have greater confidence that the company is making headway with respect to the recent operational difficulties, we will continue to err on the side of caution and stick with the lower dollar price 0.50s of '20. Finally, we point out that from both price/forward earnings (14.4 times) and price/free cash flow (12.3 times) perspectives, the company's stock appears fairly valued versus most other leading data-storage-device companies.SanDisk Product UpdateThe company recently confirmed FY 2015 revenue estimates, thanks to its successful completion of embedded-product qualifications. (This was one of the operational issues mentioned above.) In addition, it's important to note that SanDisk's inventory levels have been slowly but steadily declining. This is critical as an approximately 5% capacity increase is soon to come on line.It's important to note that the recent loss of a solid state device (NYSE:SSD) customer was not attributable to quality or performance issues as some had suspected. Rather, the lost business had more to do with a customer-level strategic decision. One positive on the SSD front: SNDK is in the midst of the qualification process for several notebook platforms with various personal computer OEM customers. This will clearly expand the company's overall notebook market share. In turn, it should drive flash product market penetration for several years to come.Enterprise SSD volumes are positioned for some long-awaited growth. Specifically, new SATA and SAS solutions and PCIe products appear poised for volume gains the second half of this year and into next. Finally, the company's 3D NAND launch remains on track for next year as well.Global Memory MarketThe world economy continues to struggle, a few glaring exceptions aside. While the sharp contraction in oil prices could still go a long way towards combating global macro headwinds, 2015 will in all likelihood remain a difficult year. That said, the market appears to be much more sanguine about the prospects for the global memory market.Industry-specific factors are seen as vastly outweighing many if not most negative global macro influences. The industry has entered into a more stable and less cyclical growth phase characterized by mid- to high- single-digit revenue growth. The all-important supply/demand environment remains highly constructive as broad-based semiconductor trends are healthy.As applications continue to evolve, so too have memory speed, reliability, and accessibility requirements. This has resulted in a steady shift in memory product solutions (e.g., from DRAM, NAND, and NOR Flash, to solid-state drives and other system solutions). Yet, despite the constant paradigm shift, manufacturing costs (measured on a cost per gigabyte basis) remain on a downward trajectory.Demand appears to be particularly strong on a number of supply-chain fronts, including the automotive, consumer, enterprise, industrial, and PC. Things look good with the Apple supply chain as well. From a supply standpoint, companies with the industry's most broad-based end-market exposures (i.e., Freescale, NXP, SanDisk and Texas Instruments) indicate that channel inventories and lead-times remain disciplined. As a result, 2015 is looking to be a good year for both the DRAM and NAND ends of the memory market, coming off of what was an all-around solid 2014.DRAM demand should be fueled by further adoption of 64-bit systems in high-end mobile devices, 2GB iPhone upgrades, and an uptick in PC growth. NAND growth should benefit from rapid growth in the solid- state device market as well as upgrades to 128GB in high-end smartphones. The China handset market is seen as contributing much of the DRAM/NAND growth, both this year and next.Recent NAND margin weakness appears to be largely attributable to excess inventory in various spots along the supply chain, largely due to Samsung's mobile product difficulties. However, in light of a still strong demand outlook, this NAND overhang should be worked off in fairly short order. That said, investors should be prepared for possible margin weakness the remainder of 1H 2015. Results for 2H 2015 should improve accordingly.Despite these positive developments, the memory market continues to face a number of challenges, to include a precariously balanced supply/demand picture and an ongoing lack of pricing power. As a result, the slightest market disruption still manages to rattle pricing and pressure margins.Still, in the face of the many challenges confronting the industry's players, we have little reason to question their long-term viability. As a result, we usually focus on where we are in the overall business/product cycle(s), evaluating the challenges confronting individual companies in our universe, the fundamental outlook for each of the players, and resultant investment opportunities.

One of those ""ah hah!"" moments, so to speak? Well I just had one of those, and it happened to be a headline over a Wall Street Journal article. As it turns out the import of this insight could be very consequential for two of my favorite companies. I'd like to take a moment to share with you why I think so, so let's get into it.Any of you that have followed me over the last couple of years in my writing about the memory industry know I have been something of a fan boy of SanDisk (SNDK) and particularly of its executive management team led by Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO, and Judy Bruner, CFO. I haven't written about the company since December of last year, but I have maintained a small position in the company even as the stock plummeted after their disastrous Q1. Quality will win out, I thought. Give it time. SanDisk is the undisputed King of NAND and their strong leadership team will pull them through the tough spot they are going through. 2016 will see them regain their outsize profitability and EPS multiple that made them one of the best stocks in the Nasdaq over the last couple of years.Based on my ""ah hah!"" moment, it's time to reassess that conclusion. The problem that I had been wrestling with is eMCP, (eMMC-based multi-chip package), which is a new and innovative way of combining DRAM, NAND and memory controller logic onto one module for inclusion in a smartphone. Micron (NASDAQ:MU) has been talking a lot about eMCP and touting their strength in this technology and saying that they will be able to significantly raise their NAND gross margins because of it. That's good, don't get me wrong, but the whole discussion by Micron left me feeling a bit off, like there had to be more to it than that. How big could this be? And then in a recent analyst call - the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global Technology Conference, Ivan Donaldson of Micron Investor Relations group said this:""70%."" Now that's a big number. MCP is now starting to really seem like a big deal to me. But still I really didn't get the import of this until I saw a June 5th WSJ headline in the Business and Tech section that went like this: ""Churning Out Smartphones Like Fast Fashion."" The article is about an Indian company called Micromax that has adopted a business model of rapidly turning out many models of inexpensive - $50 to $300 - smartphones for the low-end market. How many, you ask? Try 30. That's right, 30 new phones conceived, engineered and produced last year. Their current time to bring a new phone from concept to store shelves - three months. None of this would be possible without packaging innovations like MCP. In short, MCP really means time-to-market advantage for Micromax and a bevy of other fierce competitors like Xiaomi of China. With that time-to-market advantage they are building innovative new mobile devices that are collectively taking big chunks of market share, especially in China, India and the rest of the developing world where literally a billion new users will be adopting smartphone technology through the remainder of this decade.So what has this to do with SanDisk? Therein lies the ""ah hah!"" As you know, SanDisk and its partner Toshiba only manufacture NAND, so right out of the box SanDisk is missing the vital DRAM component of the MCP module. Could this be a problem? Some context will help illuminate the issue. Embedded revenue was 23% of SanDisk's total revenue (slide 6) in FY '14 - almost $1.5B of their total $6.6B revenue number. Up until last year, this area had been rapidly growing and as of last year's Analyst Day presentation in May of 2014 was projected to see 35% CAGR from 2013 to 2017. (slide 19) Sanjay Mehrotra could not have been more succinct in stating confidently, ""SanDisk is well-entrenched in the Chinese market."" Proof point - SanDisk's sales to Chinese mobile OEMs increased 6.5x from 2012 to 2013 with that year's $425M of embedded sales accounting for roughly 30% of total embedded sales. What's that number today? We don't know but with the rise of MCP surely it is going down unless SanDisk has decided to commit to procuring merchant DRAM for inclusion in their MCP offerings. Have they done that? Can they do that?Let's assume he can. We've got to believe that the margin hit he would take on the non-captive DRAM has to be substantial. After all, why should the three kings of DRAM make it easy for him to compete with them offering the eMCP product to the rapidly growing Chinese and Indian OEMs? The other factor to keep in mind is not only that a DRAM supply is required, an increasing amount of DRAM is being designed into products by the low and middle-market OEMs. According to Micron, the average DRAM content is exploding in the lower to middle market phones, from roughly 800MB last year to 1 to 2 GB this year. Here's Mark Adams, Micron's President, discussing this on Micron's Q2 conference call:So Micron couldn't be happier - not so SanDisk. Let's not forget that it was just last year that Bruner announced the new ""Target Financial Model"" (TFM) for SanDisk in which she set an expectation of 45-51% gross margin achievement. With SanDisk paying at least a 30% price uptick from the DRAM vendors (and probably much more) and the DRAM component costing much more than the NAND in the total MCP package, the company would be forced to cut their margin considerably just to stay price competitive with the integrated suppliers. Not an attractive proposition, would you say? How much of a hit could they take? Let's assume a 1.5 GB DDR3 DRAM package co-located with 16 GB of NAND. According to DRAM Exchange, the current spot price of that much DRAM would be $8.07 with the 16GB of NAND costing $5.28. But that's a spot price for non-captive NAND. In fact SanDisk's cost for their captive NAND is probably half of that. When you net this out SanDisk is now faced with selling a package where the gross margin they are paying the merchant DRAM vendor - approximately $2.40 - is as much as their cost in the NAND going in the package.Indeed, SanDisk is already signaling that the road ahead is tough in MCP. Here's Judy Bruner, CFO, commenting in their April Q1 earnings conference call:Here's another clue to what SanDisk is thinking about its prospects:Sanjay Mehrotra presented this slide at a recent Bernstein investor's conference. Note the ""Mobile Embedded"" commentary. The difference between SanDisk and Micron could hardly be starker. Where Micron is projecting 50%-plus growth for mobile DRAM and roughly 30%-plus growth for embedded NAND in the combined mobile embedded arena SanDisk is using the word ""modest"" to describe the market opportunity.All this evidence leads me to believe that the eMCP market will not be attractive to SanDisk. Is it feasible for them to sell only to the high-end mobile market that doesn't need eMCP? The advantage of this choice, of course, is that no DRAM is required. So how many high-end smartphone vendors are left with any market share? Right - that would be two - Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Hmm. Okay, not two - just one - that's Apple and we all know what a pushover they are in terms of negotiating supplier contracts, right? Is SanDisk seriously going to roll the dice on winning the Apple contract in order to secure a home for possibly up to a fourth of its total NAND output? Are they going to contemplate this when losing the deal means that they now have to urgently find a home for the product that has very few other possible buyers? Would they even want to enter into a negotiation with Apple knowing that Apple KNOWS how much they need a deal?Okay, scratch that idea. Surely, there's another path through this thicket that will allow SanDisk to emerge unscathed? Let's get creative. Remember that famous story about Alexander? The one where he ordered the boats burned once the Greek army had landed in Persia? The reason I mention that is because I'm wondering whether it is possible that Mehrotra's answer to the eMCP conundrum is to abandon the embedded business altogether? That decision would be pretty much equivalent to burning the boats because it means having to find a home for $1.5B in revenue. The terms of the battle would be very clear for SanDisk - find a profitable home for that business or else.Let's game plan that option. Given that decision, the company would be operating in three markets, the first being retail, the second enterprise SSDs and arrays, and the third (and least desirable from a margin standpoint) being client SSDs. Ranking the three markets by gross margin potential, the most attractive is the enterprise. This business is really a combination of two very different markets. The first is the ""data center"" or hyperscale space where the big players like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are designing and building their own servers and data centers. The ethic here is ""good enough and cheap."" SanDisk found out about how strong this ethic is last year when they positioned a top-of-the-line but pricey PCIe-based Fusion-io product against a much slower but more standardized (and way cheaper) SATA solution and lost the business. The other piece of this market is the true enterprise buyer where individual corporations buy their own equipment. Here performance can be a real differentiator and high value-added (i.e. high GM) opportunities for differentiation abound. This is truly SanDisk's sweet spot. Sadly, it is also the smallest part of the market, projected to account for a little less than 17% of the data center/hyperscale opportunity by units and slightly over 30% by revenue. But there's more potentially bad news as the new Micron/Intel 3D (NASDAQ:INTC) technology makes its entrance late this year. Will this impact SanDisk's competitive momentum and lead to a profit decline?Intel is already the largest enterprise vendor with more than double SanDisk's sales so the company certainly knows how to compete in this arena. Up until now their primary product was an SSD based on 20nm planar technology. The new 3D 32-Layer product will be twice as fast, require half the power, and last 10 times as long if it has specifications anywhere near the Samsung ""V-NAND"" product. These specs will make new drives based on this revolutionary tech node very attractive to the performance and power-oriented enterprise market.True, Intel's success with new products incorporating 3D will be gated by the long qualification cycle that enterprise customers demand, but by 2H 2016 they will be moving the revenue needle. The other challenge for SanDisk is Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), whose SAS Products business has been enabled by the Micron Seagate partnership that will provide them with Micron's very strong 16nm planar technology.Mid-range on the profit scale is retail, where SanDisk's brand dominates globally and high gross margins have been a cornerstone of the company's outsized profitability since its inception. Not only is this area a dependable source of high margin sales, it is also the spot where new technology can be put into products well before other markets are ready to sign off and accept it. For this reason you will see SanDisk's 3D tech node found in customer products on the retail shelf long before it will appear in the data center or client OEM SSD drive. So is one answer to put some bits SanDisk isn't selling in the embedded space into retail? No, not really - retail overall is a declining market, sliding from a $8B TAM this year to a little over $6B in 2018 (slide 11) as data that once resided on USB drives, SD cards and the like is now finding a home in the cloud.At the lowest end of the profitability scale is the client SSD drive that's sold to OEMs that configure it into laptops, tablets and the like. The market is growing rapidly, increasing volume 3x in two years. This market doesn't need the capacity or performance of the enterprise level SSDs so lower-cost planar TLC (3-bit MLC) product tends to be preferred by the OEM buyer looking for good enough quality at the best price. Fortunately, SanDisk is well equipped to compete in this space because they have a broad variety of TLC offerings in 19nm and they will soon be coming to market with a cost-leading 15nm TLC product. They were No. 2 in market share last year (behind Samsung) but because of the loss of the Apple contract and the need to build their inventory position they may well be losing share this year. Can they regain and possibly build market share in 2016? It could be tough with Micron desperate to get a foot in the client SSD drive door with their soon-to-be shipping 16nm TLC drives, not to mention the fierce rear-guard action that Samsung will fight in order to defend their No. 1 market position.Okay. Let's review and net this out.So where does all this rumination leave us? My conclusion is that SanDisk, despite their strengths in planar TLC and enterprise software, will follow a bad 2015 by failing to meet both their TFM revenue (10%+ YOY growth) and profit (45-51%) goals in 2016. I can't believe I'm saying that but there it is. It's too soon to say how much they will miss, but they will, and the key for the market will be their loss of momentum - at which point they become just another NAND provider and thus are subject to re-pricing based on lower multiples. Bottom line, if you are holding SanDisk now you are betting on an acquisition. SanDisk's gross margins are going to be coming back to earth.As for Micron, they are (from a NAND perspective) that lowly ""wet seaboy"" sleeping soundly in the rigging, dreaming of a big future - maybe even one that involves a crown?No wonder the King is uneasy."

SanDisk has never faced activist pressure, but there's a first time for everything. The stock took a beating earlier this year after issuing a warning for first quarter earnings. Shares are off nearly 30% over the last three months.It has put its May analyst day on hold, indefinitely. The other issue with its poor guidance is that currency headwinds aren't to blame. It's facing pricing pressures and also struggling with sales of enterprise products. These troubles comes as pricing of flash memory has been stabilizing and other companies like Toshiba are posting strong margin growth. So it's a SanDisk problem, which is positive in terms of activists.Now SanDisk does have a leadership position in the NAND flash memory business. It also has Toshiba as one of its major partners, via joint venture, for making flash memory (vertically integrating SanDisk). And there's also the idea that flash memory is taking market share from hard drives, while also becoming the go-to for storage on electronics.Bernstein's biggest focus is that SanDisk is trading at a deep discount to what it considers fair value. Specifically, the stock is trading below its $100 replacement value - about 40% below that value to be exact. Bernstein's key activist thesis? The cash balance, IP portfolio and undervaluing all makes it an ""obvious"" activist target.The lead dog in terms of buyout speculation is Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). And if they don't step up, there's also Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), Micron (NASDAQ:MU), and SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) - all of which might have interest in SanDisk. If all else fail, there's other Chinese firms to buy SanDisk. With all these catalysts, it's hard to see how investors can lose.But it's not always that simple. One problem is that the entire disk drive space is cheap, so why SanDisk?The entire memory space is relatively cheap, so that doesn't appear to be viable criteria. On a price-to-free cash flow basis, SanDisk trades at 12x, but there's another five or six industry players trading at 15x or less - including Brocade, Seagate, Teradata, Western Digital, Quantum, etc. Cash? Same story. SanDisk trades just around 6.5x price-to-cash, but there again are five others with large cash balances.Where we standI think consolidation in this industry is inevitable. The last round of consolidation was a big positive for industry players. Activists pushing for consolidation and M&A is nothing new, so we shall see. Western Digital appears to hold a lot of the power right now, so they would make sense as the prime target. Being a hard drive player, they'd also attract less scrutiny by buying up a memory flash player. In the end, Western Digital is the likely activist target, with a SanDisk or Micron being M&A bait."

3192726,51592,2015-05-19T15:26:00-04:00,"SanDisk has reported two earnings and revenue disappointments in 2015, and the shares are off over 30% YTD, making it the S&P 500's worst performer.Earnings estimates  have been revised downwards, as company-specific issues, price competition, and a strong U.S. dollar have all negatively impacted the company's results.On the surface, when looking at traditional valuation metrics, SanDisk has been discounted, but it is not remarkably ""cheap"" until you consider its substantial cash flow generation capabilities.The company offers an asymmetric risk/reward when future cash flows are discounted using growth rates that are far below its 2005-2014 growth historical growth rates.This is an opportunity to buy a cash-generating machine at a discount, and ride the coattails of a seasoned management team as they implement a turnaround.","IntroductionStorage and memory stocks, including SanDisk (SNDK), Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), are all down in 2015, with SanDisk being the worst performer. In this article, we will examine company-specific issues impacting SNDK and look at the valuations of SNDK after its dramatic share price decline in 2015. Additionally, we will review SanDisk's management team, including their background, their policy toward returning capital to shareholders, and we will assess their ability to guide a turnaround. Ultimately, a bet on SanDisk at this discounted share price is a bet on the management. Thus, we need to decide two questions. First, are SNDK's shares cheap enough to warrant a purchase? Second, can SanDisk's management implement and oversee a turnaround?HistorySanDisk was founded in 1988 by Eli Harari in Milpitas, California, which is northeast of San Jose. The company has been a leader in data storage solutions ever since its inception. The current CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, has served as SNDK's CEO since 2011. Mr. Mehrotra is a company co-founder, which is attractive to me, as I like investing alongside owner-operators, and especially founder operators who remain involved in their business.The company provides memory solutions and branded memory solutions across multiple platforms, including NAND flash storage solutions, to both consumers and enterprises. Additionally, SanDisk provides solid-state memory solutions to original equipment manufacturers. It competes directly with well financed, heavyweight global companies, including Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) and Micron. Historically, SanDisk has shown an ability to outperform these rivals in strong memory markets. However, its competitors all have substantial financial resources, and are constantly competing against one another, driving down profit margins. Thus, in weaker memory markets, SanDisk can be vulnerable.The Worst Performer In The S&P 500As of this writing on the morning of May 14, 2015, SNDK is the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 Index (NYSEARCA:SPY), and is down over 30% from the start of the year, as shown in the chart below:The drop in its share price has been a precipitous one for SNDK, with shares off sharply from their December 2014 highs in a steep stair-step down. There was a brief respite from the decline in February and early March, as NAND pricing held up firmer than industry analysts anticipated, until a renewed wave of selling hit SNDK near the end of March. This selling in late March was sparked by SNDK's management, which issued downward guidance on March 26th. While there are questions about SanDisk's ability to execute in 2015, the glass half-full view is that SNDK's shares, even today, have risen sharply from their 2012 lows.Internal Issues Lead To A Sales Miss...After growing revenue consistently from 2010 through 2014, from $4.8 billion to $6.6 billion, SanDisk hit a pothole in 2015. Due primarily to company-specific internal issues, including lower-than-anticipated sales of enterprise products, implementation delays with a key customer, and the loss of an OEM customer, which is rumored to be Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Mac product line, SNDK has reduced its 2015 revenue guidance. Originally, the company guided to a range of $6.5-6.8 billion, and that has been reduced to a range of $5.4-5.7 billion. Coming into 2015, SanDisk was anticipating revenue growth of 3% over 2014. However expectations are now showing a double-digit revenue drop, with some analysts expecting an even sharper revenue decline.... Which Slashes Earnings Estimates For 2015The revenue decline went straight to the bottom line, and estimates for 2015 and 2016 have been reduced sharply by analysts, going from $5.27 in earnings per share 90 days ago for 2015 to $2.86 per share currently. Similarly, the 2016 earnings estimates have been cut from $6.21 per share to $4.47 per share over the past 90 days. The decline in earnings estimates has been a principal factor behind the decline in the share price. The unanticipated decline in SNDK's revenues and profits is clearly a negative, yet the company's royalty business, where it licenses its patent portfolio to other memory chipmakers, has somewhat cushioned SanDisk. The high margins in the royalty business, combined with SanDisk's operational issues means that the profits from its royalty license business could represent 30-50% of the company's total 2015 earnings per share.Absolute And Relative ValuationsSanDisk is a stock that I have followed for many years, so when I discovered that it was the worst-performing S&P 500 stock in 2015, I wanted to see where it stood from a valuation standpoint compared to its own history and relative to the S&P 500, and this is what I found:Relative to its own history, SNDK is cheaper on a price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and a price-to-cash flow (P/CF) basis, while being slightly more expensive on a price-to-book basis (P/B). Relative to the S&P 500, SNDK is more expensive on every metric except the price-to-book ratio. While none of the valuation ratios stand out relative to its own historical ratios or relative to the S&P 500, unlike a stock like Ralph Lauren (NYSE:RL), which is as cheap as it has been since the bull market in stocks began in 2009, SanDisk is clearly cheap compared to its historical averages - so the downside appears limited from today's levels, as long as the broader memory market remains stable. Additionally, SanDisk does have one huge positive which is not entirely captured in the P/E, P/S and P/CF ratios. That huge positive is the fact that SanDisk has been a free cash flow-generating machine, and the company appears set to continue generating free cash flow going forward.Cash-Rich, Shareholder-FriendlySanDisk generated $1.47 billion in free cash flow in 2014, $1.65 billion in free cash flow in 2013, $42 million in free cash flow in 2012, $861 million in 2011, and $1.34 billion in 2010. Cumulatively, this has resulted in $5.75 billion in free cash flow generation over the past five years. For perspective, SNDK's market capitalization recently stood at $14 billion. The company has used this cash to benefit shareholders in a variety of ways. In 2014, SNDK purchased Fusion-io using $1.1 billion of its cash position, adding additional products and patents to its portfolio and product line-up. Additionally, and benefiting shareholders more directly, in 2014, the company used its considerable free cash flow to buy back stock, repurchasing $1.2 billion of its own stock in 2014 and $1.1 billion in 2013. From 2011, when SNDK's shares outstanding peaked at 241 million shares, the share repurchases have reduced the share count to 213 million shares at the end of 2014. On January 22nd, 2015, SanDisk announced that its board had authorized $2.5 billion in additional share repurchases, and subsequently the company accelerated its share buybacks, repurchasing $753 million worth of stock in a single quarter (March 2015). The repurchases in Q1 2015 brought the shares outstanding down to 208 million. Additionally, in the March 2015 quarter, SNDK paid $65 million in dividends to shareholders, which adds to the $235 million in dividends paid in 2014 and the $101 million paid in dividends in 2013, the first year that it paid a dividend. While share repurchases and stock dividends have served as an effective return of capital, SanDisk also has reduced long-term debt from $1.7 billion in 2010 to $1.2 billion at year-end 2014. With roughly $2 billion of cash and short-term investments on the balance sheet, the company has a net cash position, and this cash represents approximately $10 per share. Taken all together, SNDK's management has been very shareholder-friendly, while maintaining a disciplined balance sheet approach.Share Buybacks Compared To CompetitorsAs I have spent countless hours researching SanDisk, I have come to appreciate the company's management, specifically the historical and current involvement of its founders, the long tenure of its current management, and the shareholder-friendly practices, including the active, ongoing repurchase of SNDK stock with the firm's available cash flow. With regard to share buybacks, I wanted to take a look at SanDisk's approach compared to Micron, Seagate and Western Digital. All of these companies have been involved in a strong operating environment for storage solutions from 2010-2014 and have generated substantial free cash flow. Thus, I wanted to see how other companies in SNDK's peer group returned cash to their shareholders.Micron Has Been A Bad Steward Of Shareholder CapitalFrom 2010 to 2014, MU's shares outstanding increased from 988 million to 1.1 billion, and no dividends were paid. The company issued $273 million in stock in 2014, $156 million of stock in 2013, and repurchased $270 million of stock in 2012. Additionally, it bought back $206 million of stock in 2015. Cumulatively, MU has actually diluted its shareholders, as more outstanding shares exist today than in 2010, and this occurred in an environment where the company has been generating tremendous cash flows. If I were a shareholder of MU, I would not be happy with management in this regard.Seagate Has Been Terrific To ShareholdersLet's take a look at Seagate Technology. From 2010 through 2014, STX's shares outstanding declined from 465 million to 317 million, and a dividend was instituted in 2011. Wow. That's a share repurchase plan. Simply put, this is impressive. While Seagate has had some unique factors that have colored its history over the past 15 years, STX's management has certainly been shareholder-friendly over the 2010-2014 comparative time period. Specifically, the company bought back $1.8 billion of its stock in 2014, $1.4 billion of stock in 2013 and $2.1 billion of its stock in 2012. Additionally, it has bought back $664 million of its stock in 2015. On the dividend front, STX has paid $557 million in dividends in 2014, $518 million in 2013 and $372 million in 2012. Clearly, Seagate has rewarded shareholders, and this is a stock I have followed in the past and am researching further.Western Digital - Better Than Micron, But Only BarelyLet's look to Western Digital for a final comparative reading. From 2010 through 2014, WDC's shares outstanding declined from 235 million to 231 million, and the company began paying a dividend in 2013. WDC bought back $629 million of its stock in 2014, $657 million of stock in 2013 and $530 million of its shares in 2012. Curiously, the shares outstanding have only declined modestly, so WDC's management has been issuing shares at a pace that's fast enough to offset the repurchased shares. On the dividend front, WDC paid $259 million in dividends in 2014 and $181 million in dividends in 2013. Western Digital has done a poor job of returning capital to shareholders, though not as bad as Micron, from my perspective.SanDisk's Management Stands OutOn a comparative basis, only Seagate rivals and actually surpasses SanDisk in terms of management's ability to return capital directly to shareholders. While Seagate has done a fine job, and it is a company I am researching further, it has a complicated history, and its management team has had more turnover than SanDisk. In summary, compared to its competitors, when I look at management's willingness, ability and execution in returning capital to their shareholders, I'm further impressed by SanDisk's management team.Third-Party OpinionsIn the course of doing my own research, I like to examine analysis from other research providers, particularly independent third-party research providers. What are these firms saying about SanDisk? It is a mixed bag. Morningstar assigns no economic moat to SNDK, despite the value of the company's intellectual property portfolio and patent portfolio, and gives the firm a $50 fair value price, though they admit their fair value uncertainty is high for the company. Ned Davis Research, another independent research provider, like Morningstar, rates SNDK a ""Buy"", as the firm scores 90.73 on its proprietary Composite rank - with scores on this ranking ranging from 100 (the best) to 0 (the worst). Argus, another independent research provider, reiterated its ""Buy"" rating in April, but cut its price target for SNDK to $80 from the prior $86 target.Catalysts Are On The HorizonFrom my research, it appears that SanDisk's troubles in 2015 have largely been company-specific, as the overall NAND memory market has remained stable-to-healthy. According to Credit Suisse, SNDK's peers actually reported improvement in the NAND pricing environment for the first quarter of 2015, which was better than Credit Suisse's model of a -10% q/q decline in selling prices. Thus, the market was actually pricing in a good chance that SNDK would exceed estimates before the company pre-announced its negative earnings in late March and before it reported results in April, and the surprising misses are the reason that shares have been punished so harshly in 2015. This poor execution in a stronger pricing environment has hurt SNDK and its shareholders dearly, relative to the market and relative to the company's storage peers. However, I believe the seasoned, long-tenured management team has the ability to turn around the company's problems internally. Supporting my optimistic view is the fact that historically, management has done a good job of matching its production capability with the end-demand of the volatile memory market. Finally, since the CEO is an original co-founder and the CFO (Judy Bruner) has been in place since 2004, SNDK's current leadership team has ridden the cyclical roller-coaster of the memory market, and this experience with help them solve their current problems. In fact, they have already pulled the levers to correct their internal issues.Catalyst #1 - Organizational RealignmentThis excerpt by CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, taken from SanDisk's April 16th conference call transcript on Seeking Alpha, highlights the organizational changes that SanDisk is taking to resolve its internal issues:Catalyst #2 - Internal Fixes Are In ProgressWhile several issues caused SNDK to reduce its guidance for 2015, including the rumored loss of Apple's Mac SSD business, the two primary drivers of the decline in revenue and profit margins were weaker sales in enterprise products and the delay in the implementation of a new product, where an OEM customer of SanDisk was unable to use the company's new memory product in its final assembly process due to a material qualification issue.On the conference call, CEO Mehrotra said that the large OEM and SNDK have together resolved the issue with SNDK's new product component issues in the customer's SSD application. According to Mehrotra, the next steps are internal validation and then the customer's re-qualification. While this will not improve Q2 or 2015 results, revenues from this customer should improve in 2016, and the proactive willingness of SanDisk to address the problem, take responsibility, and then to work with the customer to reach a mutually beneficial solution should resonate positively with its other large clients.Additional internal remedies that are being implemented involve efforts by SanDisk to reduce expenses include plans to cut 5% of its non-factory headcount, while also executing other measures to reduce expenses from their 2015 levels. Finally, SanDisk is responding to pricing trends and plans to use the company's vertically integrated nature to leverage large customer relationships with its broader product suite. The end result should be that SanDisk stops the bleeding on a revenue basis in 2015 and continues to generate substantial operating cash flow, though not on par with 2013's or 2014's elevated levels.Catalyst # 3 - A Weaker U.S. DollarOne additional factor that could help SNDK's burgeoning turnaround is the recent weakness in the U.S. dollar. Specifically with regard to pricing, a portion of the softer pricing environment in SNDK's memory markets, especially with regard to global retail sales, can be attributed to the stronger U.S. dollar, which has risen dramatically beginning in July of 2014, as shown in the chart below:Overall, the strength of the U.S. dollar has been a significant headwind for SNDK and other chip companies, including Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM). The silver lining for SanDisk and the other chip manufacturers with significant sales internationally is that the U.S. dollar has sold off sharply from its earlier 2015 highs, and just as its strength was a headwind, its weakness will be a tailwind for results going forward.The Ultimate Catalyst - My DCF ValuationsBased on current valuations, SanDisk offers an asymmetric bet on upside reward and downside risk, and I will show that using a discounted cash flow model that I have constructed. Using the DCF approach, I can comfortably model a $122 intrinsic value price target for SanDisk's shares, as long as the company is able to stop the bleeding in 2015, bounce back in 2016, and grow revenues, profits and cash flows at 7% per year from 2017-2020, and at a 5% terminal rate thereafter. The 7% growth rate is actually conservative, as it is substantially below SanDisk's Compound Annual Growth Rates from 2005-2014, and is below the company's revenue growth rate from 2010-2014. Finally, it does not include the approximately $10 in cash per share already on SanDisk's balance sheet. This $122 price target scenario is ""Scenario #2 - Base Case"" in the worksheet below. For this scenario, and for the bullish scenario, I'm using Credit Suisse's estimates for 2015 and 2016. In a bullish scenario, ""Scenario #1"" in the table below, SNDK returns to its 2005-2014 growth rates after a significant detour in 2015 and 2016, and this results in its shares being worth north of $150 today. In ""Scenario #3 - Bearish Case,"" I modeled 2015 at the low end of SanDisk's own guidance, which is also below the estimates of the majority of analysts that cover SNDK, and then I modeled the 2016 recovery significantly below what analysts are forecasting. Finally, I slowed 2017-2020 growth to 6% across the board, and I dropped the terminal growth rate from 5% to 4%. Even in this scenario, I calculated that SanDisk shares were worth $81 today, which is $14 above the current price, and does not include the $10 per share in cash. Thus, SNDK has priced in all but the most bearish forecasts. And remember, this is a firm that grew revenue from 2008 to 2009, so it has fared well in downturns before. For all the scenarios that I have modeled, see the worksheet below:Why Are Sell-Side Analysts' Price Targets Lower?Why does a firm like Credit Suisse have a current price target of $65 on SNDK? Let's look into how they calculated their target. If you look in the footnotes of their research report, they say that the $65 target price ""represents 14x of annualized C4Q14 (w SBC) of $3.84 plus $11 net cash."" So it is a relatively straightforward method that is extrapolating the fourth quarter of 2014's results going forward. While I have respect for Credit Suisse, and I know they have other concerns regarding SanDisk's execution, I think the focus on earnings is missing the substantial free cash flow generation that the company has historically generated and could generate going forward. In summary, I believe that a DCF approach is the best way to analyze SNDK, and this approach shows a tremendously undervalued company with an asymmetric risk/reward profile.Quantifying The UpsideIf you take the base case of $122 plus the $10 per share in current cash on the balance sheet, you get a base case price target of $132. With SanDisk's shares currently trading at approximately $67 as of this writing, that implies an upside of approximately 97% from today's price levels. $132 seems high until you realize that Wall Street firms like Credit Suisse had a $125 price target on SanDisk as recently as October 15th of 2014, and the company's shares twice traded for $105 in 2014. Even if SNDK only reached the $105 per share level it traded at in 2014, the stock would return 57% from today's price levels. To reach that price target, the company clearly needs to have an effective turnaround. But it is not out of the realm of possibility, especially if the memory market stays stable and the U.S. dollar continues to give back some of its abnormal gains from 2014/2015, which is now happening.Options Could Offer A More Favorable Entry PointI often choose to create long positions with either an outright purchase of call options or by selling put options. With SanDisk's stock price near the bottom of its 52-week range, buying shares at the current juncture is a low-risk, high-reward proposition relative to SNDK's own volatile history. To be clear, the stock has historically had a beta over 2, which is twice the S&P 500's beta, so it is definitely a volatile company. However, it is being discounted right now, based on its poor execution in 2015. If SNDK can execute on its turnaround plan, and the overall memory market stays healthy, investors purchasing shares at price levels near today should benefit. To try to capture a portion of this volatility, investors could sell puts at strike prices below the current market price, in order to capture the increased volatility premium and effectively enter a buy price below today's market price for SanDisk's stock. Since the market has showed cracks in its foundation, I find this to be a particularly attractive way to gain exposure to a financially strong company like SanDisk, which has already seen its own stock price decline while the market has held firm, since SNDK could simply trade sideways if the overall market struggles. In this scenario, if the market continues to struggle and SNDK simply trades in a sideways range, investors would simply capture the put premium. Thus, I would recommend that investors who are considering buying SNDK stock outright investigate selling puts to gain exposure to SanDisk's stock. This strategy is only recommend for investors who are considering purchasing SNDK stock and who have an aptitude for options.Bottom line - Opportunity To Buy A Cash Flow-Generating Machine With Strong Management At A DiscountSanDisk is the worst-performing stock on the S&P 500 Index on a YTD basis, as company-specific execution issues and a stronger U.S. dollar have torpedoed revenue and profit forecasts for 2015. As analysts scramble to revise their estimates, the company has already initiated internal remedies to its problems. With solutions now in place, the market is awaiting the results and has discounted their probability of success. The market also has discounted SNDK's historical ability to generate cash going forward, and a DCF analysis reveals a substantially undervalued stock with an asymmetric risk/reward profile. In a bullish scenario, where SNDK simply continues to execute at the same pace it did from 2005-2014, the shares are worth over $150 per share. If SNDK's growth rate slows to half its historical level, which is my base-case scenario, I have still modeled share prices north of $120. Even if the company's growth rate slows further than that, I can still comfortably model share prices above today's price in all but the most bearish scenario. Thus, I believe the shares are attractively valued from a risk/reward standpoint. Let me be clear, SNDK is a risky stock with a historical beta over 2, which is twice the S&P 500's beta, so it is definitely a volatile company. The bet now, if you are considering buying SNDK's shares, is on management's ability to fix the internal issues and ultimately navigate the volatile memory markets. Based on their historical precedent, I'm inclined to give management the benefit of the doubt. My expectations and belief in SanDisk's recovery potential are built on the tenure of management, their history of rewarding shareholders, and the involvement of the company's original founders, including, Sanjay Mehrotra, who stated in the company's April 16th, 2015, conference call that, ""I will note that our team's top priority in 2015 is to focus, execute, and reinvigorate SanDisk."" Ultimately, this is a bet I'm willing to make, and I recommend that other investors consider purchasing SanDisk's shares near today's price levels."
3071826,32001,2015-04-15T09:09:43-04:00,Sandisk has seen corrections like this before.Gross margin peak of 51% in early '14 was the key tell.$22 per share in cash is a lot of cash.Cash-flow valuation improving.Give SNDK one more quarter of fundamental pain.,"Sandisk (SNDK) the NAND flash and now SSD manufacturer, reports their Q1 '15 after the closing bell tonight. Sorry for the late update.Analyst consensus is expecting $0.66 in earnings per share (EPS) on $1.3 billion in revenue, for expected year-over-year declines of 54% in earnings and 14% in revenue.Since the January '15 earnings release the consensus EPS estimate has fallen from $0.88 to today's $0.66 while the consensus revenue estimate has fallen from $1.437 billion to $1.304 billion.If Q2 '15 guidance meets consensus, SNDK's Q2 '15 expectations are looking for $0.86 and $1.45 billion for expected y/y declines of 39% and 11% respectively.Full year 2015 EPS and revenue expectations are now down from January '15 6% decline in EPS on a 1% increase in revenue, to today's 24% drop in EPS on a 7% drop in revenue.I've been out of the stock for clients since early, 2014, selling in the low $70's, although the big run to $105 was missed, in terms of relative performance versus the benchmark, the sale made sense. Here is a top-down look at the semiconductor cycle in early 2014.The key metric for SNDK is gross margin, and when gross margin hit 51% with the Q4 '14 earnings release, the decision to sell was made, since that was the highest gross margin print for SNDK since September, 2010's 52%, where the gross margin fell to 33% from the end of 2012, to mid, 2012, mainly thanks to the strong yen, as well as additional supply.Where does that leave us today ?Because of the short time frame until earnings tonight, I haven't put up the trend in consensus EPS and revenue, but it is safe to say given the above numbers, consensus estimates are still declining.Valuation: Last quarter's 45% gross margin was down 6% from the peak, and it will likely be lower again tonight, and for Q2 '15.SNDK's current P.E ratio of 15(x) on sharply negative growth is not really a good metric to benchmark the NAND giant against. Earnings are too volatile right now.SNDK's cash-flow valuation is getting much more desirable at 8(x) 4-quarter trailing cash-flow and 9(x) free-cash-flow is down from the peak 13(x) and 15(x) cash-flows in early 2014.However, I do not think the fundamentals have bottomed yet.The other big issue around gross margin compression is that with the 2012 drop in the stock from $53 to $30, the strong yen trading at 87 and the additional supply pushed gross margin from 51% to 33%. Gross margin may not compress that much for SNDK this time around since the yen has been materially weaker. In other words, don't wait for a 33% gross margin to own the stock. Low 40% range might be the bottom in this cycle.Finally, fundamentally speaking, including long-term investments, SNDK has $22 per share in cash on the balance sheet. The recent convertible issuance complicates the matter since converts can be dilutive to equity shareholders. (To be upfront with readers, I need to better understand how convertible debt can impact dilution, etc. and under what conditions.)The point is SNDK's dividend and share repurchase plan shouldn't be disrupted.SNDK's share repo plan started to turn accretive in Q2 '13 with 246 million fully-diluted shares outstanding. As of Q4 '14, SNDK had 226 million shares outstanding.Technically, the stock gets much more interesting close to $60 or the $200 week moving average. $50 is the upward sloping trend line off the March '09 low. I will likely start accumulating the stock on a drop below $60 with the intent to add as the stock trades between $50 and $60.Conclusion / summary: I've modeled and followed SNDK since the late 1990's in terms of spreadsheet analytics and one painful lesson I've learned is that SNDK is a stock that you want to trade, not necessarily own, given the horrific earnings volatility thanks to supply coming on line very quickly.SNDK has corrected from $105 in mid '14 to $70 today, and I think it has one more quarter of rough sledding ahead of it fundamentally.I think guidance will be weak tonight, and the stock will eventually the stock will fade from $70 to the low $60's once again.That is the way I am playing it. Give it at least one more quarter, and I will be looking to own (probably, given some other considerations) the stock in front of the July '15 earnings report.One final thought: when SNDK and other semi's were trading at all-time highs, or multi year highs, there was definite ""the cycle is different this time"" rhetoric to semi analysis and commentary. Now we are finding out that the cycle really wasn't different ""this time"". The DRAM and NAND cycle is as brutal as ever, probably due to Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) being the 800 lb gorilla in the space, and controlling semi supply, as the Saudi's control crude oil supply. (Someone tell me where I am wrong please.)"
3052706,47691,2015-04-06T11:46:34-04:00,,"By Sarah RodenSanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) provided a grim business update on March 26, while executives noted their disappointment. The weakened outlook caused SanDisk's shares to plummet to a new 52-week low of $63. The flash-memory storage company produces SSDs for data storage, flash drives, memory cards, and software.For the first quarter ending on March 29, SanDisk cut its revenue forecast to $1.3 billion, down from a range of $1.4 to $1.45 billion. SanDisk attributed the decrease to ""product qualification delays, lower than expected sales of enterprise products and lower pricing in some areas of the business."" SanDisk has withdrawn other forecasts for the first quarter and will wait to announce earnings until its report is released on April 15.CEO Sanjay Mehrotra noted, ""We are disappointed with our financial outlook. We will work through these headwinds, leveraging our compelling product roadmap and broadening customer base. We believe our growth prospects remain strong and we are encouraged by the progress we are making in our 3D NAND technology.""SanDisk, and the semiconductor sector at large, has had a series of setbacks this year. Between the increased strength of the U.S. dollar to fluctuations in chip supply, competitor Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) also slashed revenue guidance. However, analysts are unsure if the strong headwinds are inherent to the whole sector or attributed to the performance of individual companies because Micron (NASDAQ: MU), another competitor in the field, beat estimates in second-quarter earnings results amid these headwinds.Despite the bad news from SanDisk, analysts remain bullish on the stock.On April 2, analyst Jim Kelleher of Argus Research reiterated a Buy on SanDisk with a price target of $86. Kelleher added that SanDisk should have provided a timeline detailing when the hindrances will subside, noting that he expects ""more color on the environment and outlook when SanDisk reports results in mid-April."" Kelleher commented, ""Investments made in growth niches, such as SSDs and flash-based arrays, should increasingly pay off in 2016. We also look for the company to get a better handle on its supply chain in 2016."" Kelleher remains bullish because while others have sharply reduced expectations, ""declines in SNDK more than discount the challenges ahead.""Overall, Kelleher has a 75% success rate recommending stocks with a +16% average return per recommendation.Separately, on March 31, analyst Ruben Roy of Piper Jaffray maintained an Overweight rating on SanDisk, though he did not provide a price target. Roy remains bullish on the stock following the grim outlook, but cautioned investors that ""this one will take some patience."" He added that the stock is at a decent valuation due to its low trading price. Roy adds that the ""silver lining,"" though may be difficult to picture, ""is that the EPS leverage in the model works both ways.""Overall, Ruben Roy has a 57% success rate recommending stocks with a +11.9% average return per recommendation.On average, the top analyst consensus for SanDisk on TipRanks is Moderate Buy."
3036416,70965,2015-03-29T10:50:27-04:00,"SanDisk has been hammered over the last week on reduced revenue guidance.Solid state drives and removable storage are under pressure as mobile phone sales saturate and move users move to the cloud..SanDisk will be just fine - SSD is phasing out HDD and the company is still growing, just not as quickly as it once was.","By Scott TzuSanDisk (SNDK) has two problems: Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), and the cloud. We think the company is going to deal with both of these, continue to evolve, and be fine in the long run.While Samsung or cloud computing services aren't going to cripple SanDisk, they're definitely putting a roadblock in front of the company's ongoing growth that has occurred over the last 5 years.The last five years have been fantastic for the company, even trading at today's levels. At lows, the company has traded under $35 several times over the last couple of years. If you were smart enough to go bargain hunting, you're still sitting on nearly 80% gains, even with SNDK's recent fall. Hopefully, you've been taking and reinvesting the company's dividends, as well.The rumor on the street is that SNDK's SSD business with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been usurped by Samsung. It's probably true, but in the grand scheme of things, there's going to be plenty of other residual SSD business that SanDisk can take on. As hard drives cycle through and the whole world moves to solid state drives, we expect SanDisk's business to offset the lot that's moving to cloud storage over removable devices. One SanDisk segment is fighting an oncoming technology refresh and the other is pioneering one.Here is an excellent except from a SNDK-authored white paper on why SSD will replace HDD for good;We would encourage you to read the paper in its entirety.Last week, SNDK sold off hard on revising its Q1 revenue guidance, telling investors that product qualification delays, low sales on enterprise products, and discounted pricing have all contributed to revenue slowing. In addition, this concern stretches out over the course of the rest of the year, where SNDK has lowered its annual estimates according to Seeking Alpha.The company also withdrew future guidance in this PR they put out last week:All of this comes after the company missed its last earnings report in January. Shares are now almost at a 40% discount to prices they were at earlier on in the year. But we think SanDisk has a sustainable long-term model.The company's solid state drives have been one of the major forces behind the company's growth in the last 5 years. This segment of the company's business is up almost tenfold just since 2010. Much of the speculation behind the scenes is that SNDK has potentially lost Apple as a customer for SSD's. Trefis speculates on this, noting that Apple has moved on to Samsung for its SSD needs. Again, though, we think smartphones just moving into emerging markets and the significant amount of market share that other mobile carriers have offer SNDK other areas to focus in order to keep this segment steady for now, with an eventual return to growth.Another one of the headwinds that the company faces is in removable storage, where they've seen challenges. As more and more consumers start ""moving to the cloud"" the need for the types of removable storage that SanDisk pioneered has begin to drop off.When you look at the company through a different context, however, it's still rapidly growing revenue. The cuts to the company's estimate we think, are much ado about very little. Over the last five year period, the shareholder's equity in the company has almost doubled.The fundamentals of the company's business are strong and it has a firm foundation that's going to let it deal with these temporary issues. The company has $10/share in cash, which it covers its debt with. It's book value is around $30/share. At today's compressed valuation its trading at 10x prior forward estimates and only 2x book.SanDisk has also paid a dividend. While the yield of the dividend has spiked on the share price, it still remains under 2%. The company's balance sheet says to us that the dividend isn't likely to be at risk here. At worst, perhaps the company will make a small cut to its current dividend. If SNDK goes lower, we'd gladly reinvest the dividends.We think the recent dip offers a buying opportunity for those with a long-term focus. SanDisk is likely going to be fine for a couple of years to come. As more and more business moves to the cloud, however, we're going to have to revisit the company in several years time to reevaluate it for the long-term. We believe SanDisk can evolve with the changing landscape.You're getting a discounted price to buy SNDK here. We are considering adding SNDK to our long-term dividend portfolio holdings. We may add SNDK shares at any point in the future.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

3055746,23479,2015-04-07T17:26:53-04:00,"Given uncertainty around the rate of adoption of Western Digital’s products, there's room for stock price movement depending on how the results turn out in the next few years.If alternatives to SSDs play a key role in coming years and gain popularity among enterprise clients, it could boost product sales for the company.However, the company could be negatively impacted if PC makers switch to pure SSDs sooner than expected.","Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) had a tough year in terms of unit shipments for both enterprise storage products and hard drives for computers. The only area with appreciable growth in shipments was consumer electronics and branded storage. Enterprise customers have switched over to flash-based storage at a rapid pace in the last few years due to the requirement for high-end storage for cloud storage or in data centers. [1] The prices of flash storage have declined significantly over the last couple of years driven by the huge demand. Although prices for solid state drives (SSDs) are expected to continue to fall, they will almost certainly not be cheaper than regular hard disk drives (HDDs) in the next few years. [2] As a result, hard drive manufacturers including Western Digital and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) have focused on cheaper alternates to flash-storage for enterprise and cloud customers with innovative products such as helium-filled drives or Ethernet-connected hard drives. These products are still in their nascent stages and the success of these alternatives to SSDs will depend on the long-term viability and customer response to these products.On the other hand, weakness in Western Digital’s PC and laptop storage channel has been an ongoing trend over the last few years due to declining PC/laptop shipments. A significant portion of the desktop and laptop market has been cannibalized by the penetration of smartphones and tablets which use flash-storage instead of traditional spinning disk hard drives. [3] However, the penetration of SSDs in the desktop/laptop market is still fairly limited, with hybrid drives (SSD-based cache memory coupled with standard hard drives) gaining popularity compared to pure SSDs. As a result, we expect Western Digital and Seagate to continue to reap benefits in the PC and laptop storage market over the next few years.Owing to the uncertainty around the rate of adoption of Western Digital’s products and their popularity among the end-users and enterprises, there is room for stock price movement depending on how the results turn out in the next few years. Storage Providers Turn To SSD Alternatives (+10% Impact on Stock Price)Western Digital’s enterprise and cloud storage division caters to businesses and institutional clients with its storage products designed for mission critical and nearline applications. The market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions has grown at a rapid pace over the last few years as cloud-based storage has shifted consumers away from storing data locally. Additionally, the number of data centers which need to maintain backups of data and information on servers and large businesses that require high-end data storage, has risen significantly over the years. High-end data storage is often synonymous with flash-based or SSD storage due to the better performance, low latency, higher durability, lower vulnerability to mechanical shock, less power consumption and lower cooling requirements for SSDs. As a result, all-flash arrays and SSD-based storage are increasingly becoming the preferred options for enterprises and data centers. Needless to say, the price per GB for SSDs is still significantly higher than HDDs. [4] To bridge the price gap, Western Digital has introduced cheaper alternates to SSDs such as the helium-filled hard drives.The Ultrastar range of drives, sold by WD’s subsidiary HGST, are filled with helium instead of regular air drives. These hard drives have spinning disks inside them that rotate at very high speeds of about 7,200RPM during the course of their usage - similar to that of high-end regular hard drives. [5] The air inside the disks creates turbulence, causing a lot of heat to be generated. But with Helium inside them, there is a significant reduction in turbulence since Helium is about 7 times lighter than air. As a result, the Ultrastar Helium-filled drives can provide high input-output per second (IOPS) without losing efficiency, which is generally caused due to overheating. Moreover, lower turbulence inside the drive allows for closer packing of spinning disks, which allows for a 50% capacity gain.We currently forecast Western Digital’s enterprise and cloud storage unit shipments to rise from 30 million units in 2014 to 60 million units and the average price per unit to increase from $146 per unit to $167 per unit by the end of our forecast period. If the alternatives to SSDs play a key role in the coming years and gain popularity among enterprise clients, it could boost product sales for the company. If the unit shipments rise to about 70 million units, with the average selling price rising to about $177 through the end of our forecast period, there could be a 10% upside to our price estimate for the company.PC Makers Switch To Pure SSDs Sooner Than Expected (-10% Impact)Western Digital has often downplayed the relevance of pure SSDs in the PC market in the past and focused on either hybrid drives that use flash-based storage as cache memory riding on top of a HDD. The company did not bet big on SSDs mainly because they are not cheap enough to attract volumes. Moreover, with the current rate of decline of SSD prices, manufacturing them at a mass scale does not currently seem like a viable option. As a result, the company is focused on delivering solid state hybrid drives (SSHD) and cheaper traditional spinning disk hard drives in the consumer market. As a result, we forecast Western Digital’s laptop HDD units (including both SSHD and HDD) to gradually increase from 89 million units in 2014 to about 100 million through the end of our forecast period.On the other hand, we currently forecast desktop hard drives shipped by Western Digital to decline from about 65 million units in 2014 to 54 million units by the end of our forecast period. This decline corresponds to IDC’s forecast for falling global PC shipments. [6] Additionally, as SSDs become more relevant in the consumer market, the unit shipments for SSHDs and traditional HDDs are likely to suffer even more. If the industry-wide adoption of pure SSDs happens sooner than anticipated, the decline in PC and laptop HDDs could be steeper for hard drive manufacturers. This is also likely to reduce average selling prices for HDDs and put pressure on margins. If desktop and laptop HDD units shipped by Western Digital decline to 42 million and 83 million units, respectively, the average selling price per unit falls by about 5-6% per unit and the adjusted gross margin for the PC and Laptop division is compressed by just over a percentage point through the end of the decade, there could be a 10% discount to our price estimate for the company.We have a $104 price estimate for Western Digital, which is about 10% higher than the current market price. You can modify the interactive charts to gauge the impact changes in the units sold or average selling price per unit will have on our price estimate for company.Disclosure: No positions."
2849896,67695,2015-01-26T11:10:39-05:00,"Western Digital is extremely undervalued on a free cash flow and earnings basis, providing an attractive opportunity for value investors.WDC has strong price momentum, EPS growth, and return on equity numbers.SSDs will complement, rather than replace HDDs. Gartner is predicting continued (albeit weak) growth in HDDs for the next four years.We are using the recent pullback in price to build a position in the stock. Expect continued outperformance from WDC in 2015.","A) IntroductionWestern Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) is the dominant HDD manufacturer in the United States with over 45% of the entire market. While HDDs are neither as fast nor durable as SSDs, they are more than seven times cheaper. So while it's true that SSDs are taking market share, HDDs are not going anywhere anytime soon. In fact, HDD sales are expected to continue to grow for the next four years (more on that later).In this article, we'll outline why Western Digital offers the perfect combination of value, price momentum, profit growth, and efficiency. The report will start with a breakdown of Western Digital's valuation profile, then will proceed to an analysis of the price and profit growth, followed by an analysis of recent ""smart money"" transactions, and concluding with some qualitative analysis and conclusions. We take a quantitative approach to investing, preferring to focus our analysis on metrics that have strong predictive ability. Thus, we tend to analyze academic papers and perform historical back tests on different metrics before including them in our analysis. We will provide links to the academic papers we draw inspiration from as we progress through our breakdown of the stock so investors can see for themselves what we base our conclusions on.B) Valuation BreakdownWe'll start by analyzing Western Digital's value profile. This is important to look at as Nobel laureate Eugene Fame has found that ""Value stocks have higher average returns than growth stocks."" Western Digital's valuation profile is shown below:SourceThere are a few interesting things to note from the table above. First, Western Digital is a cash flow machine. The company's free cash flow yield - which we can derive by inverting price/free cash flow - is 8.25%. This is higher than its earnings yield (6.07%) meaning the company generates more free cash flow than actual earnings. Free cash flow is a much more indicative and practical measure of how a company is performing, as it is much harder to manipulate. The fact that WDC is trading at a Price/FCF of 12 when the overall market is trading at an average of 86 shows that stock is severely undervalued on a relative basis. This is a good sign as study after study shows that stocks trading on lower price multiples tend to outperform the market. WDC looks fairly attractive on a book value basis as well, with its price/book (2.75) being lower than the industry group (3.50), sector (5.08), and overall market (6.89) averages. Overall, we rate Western Digital as ""Undervalued"" and expect the stock to outperform the market by 3.67% over the next twelve months.C) Growth BreakdownThere are a variety of different growth metrics that have been shown to predict stock returns. Most important among them is price momentum. Winning stocks keep winning, and losing stocks tend to keep losing. Western Digital's growth profile is shown below:SourceWDC has managed to overcome weakness from the computer & peripherals group over the last six months (-4.43%), gaining 6.57% versus 4.48% for the technology sector and 0.34% for the overall market. WDC was even stronger over the last twelve months, gaining 21.5% versus 3.5% for the Technology sector and 2.5% for the overall market. WDC leads the industry in profit growth (annual EPS growth of 68%), which is much higher than the industry group (-41%), technology sector (3.7%), and overall market (17.3%) averages. This is also a much better growth rate compared to its main HDD rival - Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) - that had annual EPS growth of -6%. The company is also relatively efficient, returning 18% on equity and 10% on assets. Once again, these stats are much better than the industry group, sector, and overall market averages. Overall, Western Digital is a ""Moderate Growth"" company and we expect the stock to generate 2.94% of alpha attributable to growth, over the next twelve months.D) ""Smart Money"" BreakdownIn addition to value and momentum, we will also analyze how the ""smart money"" on the street is playing Western Digital. We consider the ""Smart money"" to be short sellers, company insiders, and institutions. Each of these stakeholders tends to be much more sophisticated than the average investor and thus their transactions give good clues of what is to come. We have found loads of academic research showing that short sellers, company insiders, and institutions all predict stock returns. This ""smart money"" breakdown for WDC is shown below:Looking at the table above, it seems that company insiders have been dumping the stock over the last six months (-29% in ownership). While this is disheartening at a first glance, a further look into the individual company insider transactions reveals two things. First, the majority of the insider selling comes on the same day that those same insiders execute options. This is natural and mimics the pattern seen in other companies as insiders will execute options and sell them for instant cash. Secondly, this pattern of insider selling has been consistent for the last 10 months. While this could be a worrying sign that company insiders have been dumping the stock for the last year, you could also interpret this as evidence that the recent company insider selling isn't anything to be worried about. If company insiders were selling Western Digital when the stock was below $86, and it's now at $106 after hitting a high at $114, then their transactions haven't been very indicative of future performance.We should note that the academic study cited above showed that company insider buying was much more predictive than company insider selling, as insiders will often sell based on non-market related motivations (liquidity, personal reasons, etc.). Additionally, company insider transactions were less indicative for large cap stocks, which WDC most certainly is ($25 billion market cap). Thus, while we are cautious about the company insider selling, we feel the extremely low short interest (1.5% of float versus 6.5% for the market) is more indicative of the future performance of the stock. The stock has also seen moderate accumulation from institutions recently (+1% in last three months).E) Qualitative Analysis & ConclusionsWe'll now supplement our quantitative analysis with a qualitative discussion of some of the major growth catalysts and risk factors that could impact the stock price in the near future. As we mentioned at the start of the article, the faster and more durable SSDs are expected to capture significant market share within the space. With that being said, the overall market pie is growing as HDD shipments are expected to grow 2.9% a year from 2013 to 2018, as indicated by Gartner research. Gartner has also believes that SSDs will ""complement, not replace"" HDDs as the future capacity of firms is expected to be enormous. Given that Western Digital owns 45% of the entire HDD market, they are in a prime position to capture this growth. Nevertheless, there still remains a possibility that SDDs progress faster than people expect and become cost competitive with HDDs sooner rather than later. We are firm believers in the former case rather than the latter, but nevertheless it remains a possibility.Overall, we feel that WDC is attractively valued with strong price momentum, EPS growth, and profit efficiency. The company releases earnings Tuesday after hours, with analysts expecting $2.10 EPS (according to Zacks). Western Digital has beaten consensus estimates eleven times in a row, and thus an earnings beat on Tuesday looks highly likely. Wall Street seems to agree with our bullishness, with the average price target on the stock set at $118.32 (+12% from current price), as shown below:We are using the recent pullback in stock price from $114 as our entry point, and expect the stock to continue its outperformance in 2015.

3041906,23471,2015-03-31T10:59:07-04:00,"WDC is suitable for both the Defensive Investor and the Enterprising Investor following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is undervalued at the present time.The market is implying a 3.24% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, which is significantly less than the rate the company has seen in recent years.","Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) presents an intriguing investment possibility for value investors, as the company has maintained very strong earnings growth over the last few years that may not be properly priced into the market price. Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that looking at the price cannot be the sole factor in investment decisions, as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how WDC fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham, and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation, in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.Defensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 6/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 5/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - December 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryConclusionWestern Digital passes the initial requirements of both the Defensive Investor and the Enterprising Investor. The Defensive Investor's only concern is the short dividend history, while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns. As a result, all value investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to that valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, WDC has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $3.71 in 2011 to an estimated $6.08 for 2015. This is a strong level of demonstrated growth, which is well above the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of only 3.24% annually over the next 7-10 years. In fact, the historical growth is around 12.83% per year, so the market is expecting a very significant drop in earnings growth. The ModernGraham valuation model reduces the historical growth to a more conservative figure, assuming that some slowdown will occur, but still returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling above the current price, indicating the company is undervalued at the present time."
3038376,25120,2015-03-31T10:49:35-04:00,"SanDisk issues a second big profit warning in 2015.The performance is very soft, and I doubt that softness in the retail business alone is behind this weakness.A lot of bad news is being priced in at these levels, especially given the large and comfortable cash balances.I will await quarterly earnings results before reconsidering my cautious stance, looking for clues about the rest of the year and recent share repurchases.","SanDisk (SNDK) continues to struggle big time. Nearly three weeks before the release of first quarter results, the company delivered a big profit warning.While this shows that the business has serious trouble ahead, SanDisk is likely to remain profitable while the softness certainly has to put management on high alert. The valuation of the firm has been cut nearly in half from last year's highs. Combined with the fact that the company is still profitable and has a very strong balance sheet, SanDisk remains in a relative strong position.I will await the official first quarter results before reconsidering my cautious stance. I would like to get a clue about current operations as well, especially the way in which management is using strong cash balances at the current time.A Very Poor First QuarterSanDisk now sees revenues for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 coming in at $1.3 billion. Previously the company expected revenues of $1.4 to $1.45 billion which means that revenues are seen 7% to 10% lower than previously anticipated.The company blames the shortfall to lower prices, lower volumes and production qualification delays as well as supply challenges. Worse, these issues are expected to continue to impact results for the rest of the year as well. As a result, the previous guidance has been withdrawn as the company is even rescheduling investors day which has been planned for May.While the first quarter is typically a seasonally slower quarter, the guidance is outright terrible. Sales are now seen down 25% compared to the fourth quarter, being seen down 14% compared to the same period in the year before. Note that at the time when SanDisk issued the original first quarter revenue guidance, consensus estimates for the quarterly sales still stood at $1.6 billion.Impact On MarginsSanDisk predicted gross margins of 43% for the first quarter on the release of fourth quarter sales, while anticipating operating costs of $420 to $430 million.This original guidance translates into gross profits of $602 to $623 million. This implies that operating profits were seen at $172 to $203 million. While I know SanDisk has failed to update its margins guidance, the poor volume and pricing developments have probably been detrimental for margins.For simplicity I assume that gross margins might fall another 2 percentage points which implies that gross profits are seen at just $533 million. With no changes in the operating cost base, operating profits are seen at just $103 to $113 million. Given statutory tax rates, earnings could come in at around $70 million, or just $0.30 per diluted share.Pro Forma ValuationFortunately SanDisk has a very strong balance sheet containing a lot of cash and marketable securities. To be exact, SanDisk held $5.02 billion in these assets, excluding nearly a billion in notes receivable and investment in Flash Ventures.Total debt holdings stood at $2.12 billion including convertible debt, marking a net cash load of $2.9 billion. The company has some 217 million regular shares outstanding, although it has 235 million shares outstanding on a diluted basis. To avoid double-counting the debt and potential shares outstanding from convertible debt, I assume 217 million shares outstanding.These shares now trade at $65 per share, thereby valuing the equity in the business at $14.1 billion. Excluding the net cash holdings, the enterprise valuation comes in at $11.2 billion. The situation in which companies operate with net cash balances is interesting. Shares have fallen some 40% from the highs of $109 per share, while the enterprise valuation has fallen even more steeply. Based on this metric, the business valuation has come off 45%.2015 PredictionsThe $100-$150 million revenue shortfall for the first quarter is very soft indeed. Extrapolating a similar shortfall throughout the year means that revenues could fall by $400-$600 million versus the previous guidance.As a result I can see revenues coming in at $5.9 to $6.4 billion based on the previous guidance for the year. Despite the wide range and given the negative momentum I do see downside risks to this guidance. Assuming that gross margins could fall another 2% to 43-44% for the full year, gross profits are seen at $2.54 billion to $2.82 billion.Subtract from this roughly $1.72 billion in operating expenses and another $80 million in other expenses, and operating profits are seen at $740 to $1.02 billion. Net earnings are seen at $480 to $660 million as a result follow statutory tax rates, translating into earnings of $2.20 to $3.00 per share on a GAAP basis. This translates into an 18-24 times forward earnings after backing out the cash, hardly above the current market multiples.These anticipated earnings movements are dramatic given that the business has posted profits of a billion per year over the past two years. Despite the dramatic developments, SanDisk remains solidly profitable.Final ThoughtsSanDisk simply has a lot of issues going on. Retail storage products which typically carry high margins are under big pressure as consumers shift to online storage. These online services provide greater ease of use, greater reliability and often lower costs.The embedded products business has been relatively stable in recent quarters, although given the large revenue miss it is likely that SanDisk will see weakness across all of its business units. The SSD solutions business which has been the growth segment of the business in recent quarters might see softness as well. It should be stressed that the Fusion-io deal has been incremental in this recent growth as well.In January when SanDisk released its fourth quarter results, I last had a look at the prospects for the shares which still traded $10 above today's levels. While I warned about the turmoil at the time, I pointed toward the huge cash balances which allow money to be returned to investors. A $3 billion share repurchase authorization allows the business to buy back 45 million shares at current levels in the mid-sixties, a fifth of the total share count.Despite the payouts, I believed it has still been relatively early in the downturn, as I predicted more pressure on the removable storage business, which by now has become evident. I concluded that we would have not seen the lows in the share price yet as shares have indeed plunged another $10.While the business continues to deteriorate, the strong cash balances remain intact unless the company ended up spending a lot of money on buybacks at levels of $80 in recent weeks. That's a real possibility and therefore I would like to await the official earnings release to see how much money has been spent on buybacks.If management would have spent a great deal of cash to buy back shares some 20% above today's levels, that would be a very negative sign. The truth is that the current enterprise valuation has fallen by roughly 45% from the highs of last year. While the operational performance is dismal, the valuation has come down while the balance sheet remains intact.For now I remain cautious as I need to await the quarterly earnings release to see if the company has destroyed value by buying even more shares at high levels in recent weeks. I would like to have greater insight into the margin and revenue developments as well before potentially considering a position."

On August 21, 2014, I wrote an article about Western Digital, describing the company and recommending the stock. In this article, I will give some update information about the stock.Western Digital is continuing with its strategy to expand into higher-value data storage platforms and systems in order to address the massive growth in storage requirements in cloud data centers by important acquisitions. The use of cloud-based storage is growing fast as it allows users to access content through smartphones, tablets, and PCs.Acquisition of AmplidataOn March 03, Western Digital announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, HGST, has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Amplidata, a privately-held developer of object storage software for public and private cloud data centers. According to Western Digital, Amplidata's primary offering is Himalaya, an advanced object storage software product that enables scale-out software-defined storage systems.On March 16, Western Digital announced that HGST has completed the acquisition.In my view, Amplidata's acquisition is a very positive development for the company. Although the financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed, I believe that Western Digital is not paying an excessive price for the acquisition. The purpose of the deal was to make Western Digital a more customer-focused storage company. What is more, the acquisition was expected to enhance the existing storage capabilities of HGST and expand its participation in the cloud data center platforms.Major DevelopmentsOn March 24, Western Digital announced that its subsidiary HGST has already deployed more than one million helium-filled hard disk drives. In addition, according to the company, the drives are field-proven and rated for two-and-a-half million hours mean time between failures.The company claims that HGST's helium HDDs are poised to become the mainstream choice for data center applications where storage density, reliability, and power efficiency are paramount. We do not have an approval for the company's claim from external sources. However, HGST is now shipping its second generation HelioSeal Platform drives, and it is shifting its volume mix and ramping Helium production to meet strengthening customer demand across cloud and mainstream data center applications.In my opinion, HGST's achievement might contribute to increasing demand for its products. According to the company, there is already strong market acceptance for the drive from the largest cloud service providers, Internet giants, OEMs and businesses around the world, including Netflix, Huawei, Inspur, HP, OVH, Starline, Buffalo, DataON, DDN, and Racktop.Latest Quarter ResultsOn January 27, Western Digital reported its second-quarter fiscal 2015 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.16 (7.6%) and exceeded the Street's consensus on revenues.Last quarter was the fourth quarter in a row that Western Digital beat earnings estimates, as shown in the table below.Source: Yahoo FinanceThe company reported revenue of $3.9 billion and net income of $460 million or $1.93 per share for its second fiscal quarter. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $539 million or $2.26 per share. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported revenue of $4.0 billion and net income of $430 million or $1.77 per share. Non-GAAP net income in the year-ago quarter was $532 million or $2.19 per share.Strong revenue and gross margin growth were driven by strength in capacity enterprise, surveillance, and enterprise SSDs. While desktop and notebook units saw sequential decline, Exabyte shipments continue to accelerate.In the report, Steve Milligan, President and Chief Executive Officer said:Next Quarter ResultsWestern Digital will report its third-quarter fiscal 2015 financial results on April 28. According to 20 analysts' average estimate, the company is expected to post a profit of $1.95 a share, a $0.01 rise from its actual earnings for the same quarter a year ago. The highest estimate is for a profit of $2.05 a share while the lowest is for a profit of $1.94 a share.Top Analyst OpinionAccording to TipRanks, a website that ranks experts (analysts and bloggers) according to their performance, among the analysts covering Western Digital stock, there are five analysts who have the four or five star rating, and four of them recommend the stock. The average price target according to the five top analysts is $117, which is a 17.4% upside for the stock.Source: TipRanksValuationWDC's stock has outperformed the market in the last few years. Since the beginning of 2012, WDC's stock has gained an impressive 221.9%, while the S&P 500 index has increased 67.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 92.3%.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.Western Digital's valuation metrics are very good; the trailing P/E is at 15.42, the forward P/E is very low at 11.20, and the enterprise value/EBITDA ratio is also very low at 6.75.In addition, WDC's efficiency and return on capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median, and the S&P 500 median as shown in the tables below.Source: Portfolio123On February 03, Western Digital announced that its board decided to increase its dividend for the third quarter of fiscal 2015 to $0.50 per share. The board also authorized an additional $2.0 billion for share repurchases by the company. Since 2012, the company has increased its quarterly dividend three times from the original $0.25 per share and repurchased approximately $2.6 billion of its shares. During the December quarter, the company utilized $309 million to repurchase 3.2 million shares of common stock.The forward annual dividend yield is at 2.01%, and the payout ratio is only 21%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was very high at 26%, and over the past five years was also very high at 24.8%.Since the company generates lots of cash, and the payout ratio is very low, there is a good chance that the company will continue to raise its dividend payment.GrowthWestern Digital has recorded substantial growth in the last few years. The company's annual average sales growth over the last five years was at 15.2%, and the average EPS growth was very high at 26.3%. The estimated EPS growth for the next year is at 7.57%, and the average annual estimated EPS growth for the next five years is at 7.51%.SummaryWestern Digital delivered strong financial results in its latest quarter, with better-than-anticipated revenues, gross margins, and earnings. The company has achieved strong growth for its higher-margin products, including enterprise and branded, outpacing lower-margin PC and CE drives. Western Digital has very good valuation metrics and solid earnings growth prospects; its enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is very low at 6.75. The company is generating strong free cash flows, and returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback and increasing dividend payments. During the December quarter, the company utilized $309 million to repurchase 3.2 million shares of common stock. All these factors bring me to the conclusion that WDC stock still has room to grow, and it is a Buy right now."
2845786,23479,2015-01-23T16:41:21-05:00,"Revenues were slightly lower than the company's guidance given at the end of Q3 due to weakness in its retail channel and lower iNAND product sales.Growth from solid state drive sales, which rose by over 48% y-o-y to $538 million for the quarter, offset the decline in revenues generated by removable storage products sold via the retail channel.SSDs contributed 31% of SanDisk's net revenues in Q4 and 29% for the full year, up from 21% in the prior year quarter and 19% in 2013.","SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) announced its fourth quarter earnings on January 21, with revenues of $1.73 billion, flat over the year ago period. Revenues were slightly lower than the company's guidance given at the end of Q3 due to weakness in its retail channel and lower iNAND product sales. On the other hand, growth from solid state drive (SSD) sales, which rose by over 48% y-o-y to $538 million for the quarter, offset the decline in revenues generated by removable storage products sold via the retail channel. SSDs contributed 31% of SanDisk's net revenues in Q4 and 29% for the full year, up from 21% in the prior year quarter and 19% in 2013. [1] SanDisk expects to generate revenues of over $1.4 billion in Q1'15 and full-year revenues to be around $6.5-$6.8 billion.Solid State Drives Continue Growth SpreeSanDisk generated 31% of its revenues from SSDs in the fourth quarter. Comparatively, the contribution of these high-margin SSDs was only 19% in 2013. [2] Keeping with the trend in the last three quarters, the company witnessed strong y-o-y growth in enterprise SSD sales. SanDisk's enterprise SSD sales grew by a massive 140% over 2013 to $660 million for the full year. Additionally, SanDisk expects its $1.1 billion acquisition of Fusion-io to start being accretive to its earnings from mid-2015. The acquisition could help SanDisk overtake its nearest rivals in the enterprise SSD market, as management believes that the company now has the ""broadest portfolio of enterprise and consumer flash solutions"" in the storage industry. Keeping in mind the strong demand for enterprise-grade products, management mentioned that the company is now in a position to generate $1 billion in revenues from only enterprise SSD sales in 2015 - one year ahead of schedule.The company posted solid results in the client SSD space as well, with revenues growing by 36% y-o-y to almost $1.3 billion. According to our estimates, SanDisk's share in the client SSD market has increased to nearly 18%, up from 15.4% in 2013. We currently forecast SanDisk's share in this market to rise moderately to over 20% through the end of our forecast period. Management mentioned that the company could witness comparatively lower demand for client SSDs in the coming quarters as key customers are moving to embedded and enterprise-grade SSD solutions. As a result, the company could witness a slowdown in client SSD revenues.Declining Removable Storage RevenuesRevenues generated by SanDisk's removable storage unit were down by 22% year-on-year to about $573 million during the fourth quarter. It also was a 14% sequential decline over the September quarter. The company posted lower revenues due to weakness in the retail channel which was driven by both declining prices, supply constraints and low demand for certain aging products. Within retail products, demand for storage cards for imaging devices was especially low during the quarter - primarily across Europe and Asia-Pacific. Although imaging storage revenues were sequentially higher than the previous quarter owing to seasonality, the revenue growth did not make a material impact to overall removable storage revenues. Management attributed the low sales number in European markets to macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical issues - which may continue through the coming quarters. However, the company introduced removable flash drives for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Android-based smartphones and tablets in Q4, which could boost its retail channel product sales in the coming quarters - especially in North America (see:SanDisk Showcases New Products At CES 2015).Impact On MarginsSanDisk's non-GAAP gross margin compressed by 6 percentage points over the prior year quarter to 45% during Q4 2014 primarily due to weakness in the retail channel, which led to lower revenues of high-margin retail products. Moreover, management mentioned that certain products reached the end of their product life sooner than anticipated by the company due to which the company used older X2 technology bits instead of X3 NAND. As a result, there was inefficiency in memory usage leading to higher costs incurred by SanDisk, due to which the company's average production cost per GB rose by 3% while the average selling price (ASP) per GB decreased by 4% y-o-y during the quarter. SanDisk's non-GAAP gross margin for the full-year was slightly better than the previous year at 48% due to strong performances in the first half of the year.Disclosure: No positions."
3028706,23479,2015-03-25T16:49:04-04:00,"The newly-introduced hard drive could boost unit sales in the coming quarters and help the company defend its market share against competitors such as Seagate.According to our estimates, the enterprise and cloud storage division makes up about 36% of our $104 price estimate for Western Digital's stock.The company had a lackluster 2014 in terms of enterprise hard drives sales with unit shipments stagnating compared to the previous year.","Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) recently introduced a new lineup of high-capacity enterprise grade hard disk drives (HDD). The manufacturer added to its WD Re+ range of enterprise drives, marketing them as the most power-efficient enterprise hard drives currently available. [1] The 3.5″ form factor 6 terabyte (TB) hard drives consume as little as 6 watts of power per drive, which is about 40% lower than its existing WD Re and WD Se range of high-end enterprise hard drives. The company had a lackluster 2014 in terms of enterprise hard drives sales, with unit shipments stagnating compared to the previous year. The newly-introduced hard drive could boost unit sales in the coming quarters and help the company defend its market share against competitors such as Seagate (NASDAQ:STX). In this article we take a look at Western Digital's efforts to rekindle its enterprise storage division with the new launch. According to our estimates, the enterprise and cloud storage division makes up about 36% of our $104 price estimate for Western Digital's stock. Our price estimate is slightly higher than the current market price.Western Digital's enterprise storage division caters to businesses and institutional clients with its storage products designed for mission critical and nearline applications. The market for mission critical enterprise storage solutions has grown at a rapid pace over the last few years as cloud-based storage has shifted consumers away from storing data locally. Additionally, the number of data centers which need to maintain backups of data and information on servers, and large businesses that require high-end data storage, has risen significantly over the years. Accordingly, enterprise-grade hard drives are manufactured to withstand high workloads and deliver optimum performance for long periods of time. Western Digital's enterprise and cloud storage division includes hard drives sold by the company under the WD banner such as WD Se, WD Re, WD Ae and hard drives sold by its subsidiary HGST under the Ultrastar brand name.Within the WD range of enterprise drives, the 6TB drives in the Se and Re categories consume about 7.5 watts of power in idle mode going up to 10.5 watts of power in random or sequential read/write operations. [2] [3] On the other hand, the 6TB WD Ae drives consume 4.8 watts in idle mode going up to 6.5 watts in sequential write operations. [4] One of the key reasons why the Ae drives consume less power is because they spin at a lower RPM (~5,800 RPM compared to 7,200 RPM for Re/Se drives). The newly introduced Re+ drives spin at 7,200 RPM, yet consume only 6.2 watts of power for sequential write operations giving optimal performance at maximum efficiency. [5] Moreover, the Re+ drives can operate workloads of up to 550 TB per year compared to under 200 TB per year handled by standard enterprise drives. The tested mean time between failure (MTBF) for these drives is as high as 1.2 million hours, compared to about 500,000 - 1 million hours for standard enterprise drives. Western Digital's enterprise drives also include Helium-filled drives, which the company introduced in late-2013 under the brand name Ultrastar. These drives are sealed with helium instead of air, which vastly reduces turbulence/friction inside the drive once the disks are in operation and start spinning. As a result, they can potentially reduce the total power consumption by about 25%. [6]Impact On The Enterprise Storage DivisionWestern Digital shipped 6.1 million enterprise-grade storage units in calendar year 2009, which has risen to 30.6 million units shipped in 2013. Comparatively, the number of unit shipments stagnated in 2014 with just over 30 million units shipped during the calendar year. On the other hand, Seagate shipped 33 million enterprise hard drives in 2014, up from 31.6 million in 2013. Contrary to the consistent growth rate in net shipments for Seagate, a recent research report by cloud service provider Backblaze highlighted that Seagate's enterprise hard drives fail at a significantly higher rate than Western Digital or WD-owned HGST hard drives. [7]With an extra emphasis on low power consumption, Western Digital management expects the total cost of ownership of large-scale deployments to decrease by as much as a few ""millions of dollars"" annually. [8] Moreover, the important metric to evaluate cost savings in this case is a watt-per-gigabyte ratio rather than the cost of storage on a traditional price per GB basis. The Re+ range of drives claim to have a leading industry-wide watt-per-gigabyte ratio which makes them an ideal long-term cost-sensitive solution for data centers and enterprise customers. According to data compiled by research firm ReportsnReports, the global enterprise storage market is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 15% from 2015 through 2019. [9] The growing demand for high-end storage drives, a superior product line up, an improvement in customer mentality and the benefits of low power consumption could drive Western Digital's unit shipments in the coming years.We currently forecast Western Digital to sell nearly 60 million storage units by the end of our forecast period with unit shipments rising gradually over the next couple of years before resuming the historic growth rate. If unit shipments surge to about 40 million units through 2015 and subsequently rise at a more gradual pace to about 60 million units by the end of our forecast period, it could imply a 6-7% upside to our $104 price estimate for Western Digital's stock. You can modify the interactive chart below to gauge the impact changes in enterprise and cloud unit shipments for the company's enterprise storage division will have on our price estimate for company.Disclosure: No positions."

Using rankings like these leaves the door open to generalization, so if you intend to actually act on any recommendations, please read the entire article as investment opportunities are rarely black and white. Additionally, the ideas that form the basis for this segment are heavily reliant on momentum and contrarian investing philosophies so it is not for everyone. If you want to see more of this segment, you can follow me and if you have any questions feel free to message me or leave a comment.BackgroundSanDisk (SNDK) stock dropped Thursday after slashing guidance for Q1 2015 revenue. At the close, SNDK was down more than 18% leaving the stock at $66.20 and nearly 40% off from its 52-week high. Additionally, SNDK hasn't dropped this low since October 2013. So what's going on here?The DropSNDK's management attributed the revenue cut to a multitude of factors, specifically:For the reasons mentioned, SNDK cut revenue guidance for Q1 2015 from $1.40-$1.45 billion down to $1.3 billion. Flash storage is a very competitive space and investors are obviously worried about SNDK's ability to compete. Look at the price chart above for a minute: if stock price is really a gauge of investor sentiment then SNDK is not much loved by the market. It doesn't seem like investors are confident in SNDK's ability to maintain an edge and compete in the flash storage market.This lack of investor confidence is most likely what caused such a precipitous drop in the stock price Thursday. When a company is seen as an underachiever, things like slashing revenue forecasts and reporting contracting margins will have a larger effect than they normally would.In addition to this guidance cut, SNDK also went through the same process for Q4 2014. There the company slashed revenue guidance from $1.8-$1.85 billion down to $1.73 billion and guided margins below previous guidance as well. It is likely that the guidance cut for this quarter is a ripple effect from last quarter and therefore shouldn't really be much of a surprise. Whatever market tendencies were affecting the company last quarter are still affecting the company this quarter it would seem. But are the fears overblown? Is the market exaggerating? Is SNDK a value play or a value trap?Strong Buy On The DropWhen one looks at the fundamentals of SNDK and the future of the flash memory market, it should be fairly obvious that the stock is not even close to being a value trap.The company's revenue has been rising at a steady pace for years and is showing no signs of letting up. Margins have contracted slightly because of increased competition in the market, which is in turn keeping profit from rising, but this is nothing to worry about considering that these ""lower"" gross margins are still around 45%. Margins may continue to contract as the market's competitive landscape continues to intensify, but SNDK has a big enough foothold in the space that the increased competition doesn't pose a huge danger to the company.Another reason why the company is well insulated from market risks is its rock-solid balance sheet. SNDK sports a miniscule debt-to-asset ratio of 0.21 and has $4.2 billion in current assets, which are assets that can be quickly converted into cash. The company also has shown interest in share buybacks, which is evidenced by its $2.5 billion buyback announced this January.Aside from its fundamentals and balance sheet, SNDK is in a market that's expected to show healthy growth into the future.New enterprise and non-enterprise opportunities in developing countries such as China and India will provide more sources of revenue for the flash memory market, which will keep SNDK growing for the foreseeable future. As is the nature of growing markets, competition will increase, but SNDK is in a good position to capture a chunk of any new markets that may emerge.The stock prices of both SNDK and Micron (NASDAQ:MU), one of SNDK's main competitors, have been lagging lately, but the market is missing the big picture. Flash memory isn't something that is just going to go away or become obsolete any time soon. Contracting margins are most likely only temporary and market sales are expected to increase. Investors should stop looking at short-term headwinds that are facing the industry and focus on the long-term view. I guarantee you that nothing happened between December 2014, when SNDK was over $100, and now to make the company shed a few billions dollars in market cap. I expect the stock to rebound promptly after the market takes time to sort everything out.ConclusionSNDK stock plummeted after issuing a guidance cut for Q1 2015 revenue. The market overreacted to the announcement and SNDK had already taken too much of a beating over the past couple months to warrant a sell-off. The company's fundamentals and market presence are still intact and I expect the stock to bounce quickly after taking a week or so to settle down. I rate SNDK a Strong Buy on the drop."
2834806,23479,2015-01-20T20:18:58-05:00,SanDisk expects SSDs to stay at similar levels through the first three quarters due to the expected growth in enterprise storage demand and new products.The company revised its revenue guidance for Q4 due to lower than anticipated iNAND product sales through the quarter.We currently forecast SanDisk's embedded storage revenues for the full year to be about 8-9% lower than 2013.,"SanDisk (SNDK) is scheduled to announce its fourth quarter earnings on Wednesday, January 21. The company witnessed a 7.5% year-over-year growth in net revenues to $1.75 billion in Q3 on the back of solid performance from its solid state drive (SSD) division. SSDs contributed 27% of SanDisk's net revenues for the quarter - up from 20% in the prior year quarter. Moreover, SSD revenues grew by 65% y-o-y through the first three quarters of 2014 to $1.4 billion. Despite the expected growth in SSD revenues, the company has revised its revenue guidance for Q4 to $1.73 billion, lower than the previously estimated range of $1.80-$1.85 billion. [1] SanDisk expects lower revenues due to weakness in its retail channel and iNAND product sales.SanDisk's non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 improved by over a percentage point over the prior year quarter to 49%, primarily due to the increasing mix of SSD product sales and a higher use of X3 memory. Relatively high demand for low-margin custom embedded storage products kept gross margins lower than the first two quarters of 2014 - in line with the company's expectations. The company also revised its non-GAAP gross margin guidance from about 48% previously to about 45% now. [2] We have a $94 price estimate for SanDisk, which is over 15% higher than the current market price. SanDisk's stock traded at around $100 in November and December before plummeting to around $80 after the company revised its revenue and margins guidance. Solid State Drives To Sustain GrowthThe SSD division has been the fastest growing segment within the company, with revenues through the first three quarters of 2014 nearly 65% higher than the year-ago period at $1.4 billion. [3] The division has accounted for about 28% of SanDisk's net revenues in the same period, up from only 19% in 2013. With user data increasingly moving to the cloud, storage demand from data centers is increasing. Since SSDs provide efficient storage through higher Input/Output per Second (IOPS) and low latency, they are increasingly becoming a preferred option for enterprises. [4] SanDisk announced the acquisition of flash-based storage provider Fusion-io for $1.1 billion in June, after which the company claims to have the ""broadest portfolio of enterprise and consumer flash solutions"" in the storage industry. Although the Fusion-io acquisition could help SanDisk overtake its nearest rivals in the enterprise SSD market, the company will continue to face stiff competition from major SSD storage providers such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). [5] In addition to fueling SanDisk's top line growth, this division also adds to the company's overall profitability as SSDs are high-margin products. The company expects the contribution of SSDs in Q4 to stay at similar levels through the first three quarters due to the expected growth in enterprise storage demand and its new products.Embedded Storage And Retail ChannelSanDisk's embedded storage division, which includes non-SSD storage products attached to a host board, has witnessed a decline in revenues due to an increasing mix of embedded SSDs used in tablets, smartphones and other portable devices. As a result, the contribution of embedded storage to SanDisk's net revenues has dropped from 27% in 2013 to just over 20% in the first three quarters of 2014. Revenues generated by SanDisk's embedded storage division in the three quarters of 2014 were down by almost 20% y-o-y to under $1 billion. However, revenues rose 32% sequentially in Q3, which the company attributed to a comparatively higher proportion of custom embedded storage products and iNAND storage product sales. Additionally, one of its major OEM customers, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), increased the capacities of its existing mid-tier and top-tier devices in Q4 to 64GB and 128GB, from 32GB and 64GB, respectively. As a result, SanDisk was initially positive about year-on-year growth in embedded storage revenues in the fourth quarter. [6] However, the company revised its revenue guidance for Q4 due to lower than anticipated iNAND product sales through the quarter. We currently forecast SanDisk's embedded storage revenues for the full year to be about 8-9% lower than 2013.SanDisk's removable storage division witnessed sustained demand for storage products during the year, with revenues flat over the prior year 9-month period at just over $1.9 billion. Despite flat revenues over 2013 levels, the contribution of removable storage to net revenues declined from 43% of overall revenues last year to about 39% this year. The company introduced the world's highest-capacity SD card in September, with a capacity of 512 gigabytes. This was more than a thousand-fold increase in capacity for a memory card since the company launched a 512 MB SD card in 2003. Although management mentioned that retail product sales were lower than anticipated in Q4, sales volumes could rise in the long run with declining average selling prices (ASP).Additionally, the company introduced removable flash drives for Apple and Android-based smartphones and tablets in the quarter to boost its retail channel product sales. According to IDC forecasts, smartphone sales are likely to grow at a CAGR of 9.8% from 2015 through 2018, with a base figure of 1.4 billion smartphone sales in 2015. [7] Furthermore, tablet sales are expected to grow at about 5% annually from 235 million units sold in 2015 to 286 million tablets sold in 2018. [8] This gives a huge market space to SanDisk's newly introduced flash drives. We currently forecast SanDisk to sell about 120 million USB drives in 2015, with more than a quarter of global flash drive sales.Disclosure: No positions."
2845816,25120,2015-01-24T16:49:18-05:00,"SanDisk reports very soft fourth quarter results, as has been pre-announced.The weakness is now seen for the current quarter and for 2015 as well.Investors therefore took another hit, after shares have lost 25% of their value in just a month's time.With more pain anticipated in the coming year, I think it is still too early to buy into the shares now.","SanDisk (SNDK) continues to be in a difficult spot. The flash storage solution provider already pre-released weak fourth quarter results ahead of the final earnings report. This disappointment was followed by a weak guidance for the current first quarter, creating a renewed disappointment among investors.Fourth Quarter HeadlinesRevenues for the final quarter of 2014 grew by just 0.4% compared to the year before, coming in at $1.74 billion. Earlier the company itself forecasted that these revenues would come in at $1.80 billion to $1.85 billion.This was only part of the bad news, as gross margins compressed to just 42.6% of sales as these margins came in a full seven percent lower compared to last year. Margins took a beating for a variety of reasons as discussed in the conference call.The retail component of the business, driven by high-margin removable storage products, has fallen to just 31% of sales while this percentage still came in at 38% in the year before. On top of that, limited supply and low inventory levels have prompted SanDisk to use more expensive sub-components. The company furthermore had to deal with weakness in Europe and certain parts of Asia.Besides the gross margin pressure, earnings took a further hit resulting from notably higher sales and marketing expenses, $8 million in restructuring expenses and nearly $14 million in amortization charges.Despite the higher cost base and great compression in gross margins, operating margins have fallen to 18.9% of sales, which is much smaller to the 29.4% margins reported last year.As a result of these terrible margin developments, net earnings plunged by 40.2% to $201.9 million. Amidst a flattish outstanding share base, earnings dropped by a similar percentage to $0.86 per share. Closely watched non-GAAP earnings dropped by nearly 25% as well, coming in at $1.30 per share.The results disappointed CEO Sanjay Mehrotra who attributes the weakness to industry supply constraints. Mehrotra believes that the NAND industry remains healthy, with the performance of SanDisk anticipated to improve throughout 2015.Changing BusinessSanDisk is of course dealing with rapid shifts in its strategy. Embedded products, which are attached to the host system boards, remained relatively stable at 26% of sales in the final quarter. The real winner remains the SSD Solutions segment which made up 31% of revenues in the quarter, up 10 percent points compared to the final quarter of 2013. The acquisition of Fusion-io has been a partial driver behind this growth.SanDisk's troubles relate to the real pain in removable storage like cards and flash drivers. These products make up a third of sales now, down from 43% last year. Overall long-term trends remain in place. The average unit sold by SanDisk now has the capacity to store little over 22 gigabytes which is up some 32% in terms of capacity on an annual basis. Average selling prices per gigabyte have been down 24% on an annual basis.2015 GuidanceDespite the low visibility, SanDisk came up with a guidance for both the current quarter and year.Revenues for the first quarter are seen at $1.40 billion to $1.45 billion, which means that at the midpoint of the guidance, sales are seen down some 5.8% compared to last year. Gross margins are seen around 43% of sales while GAAP operating costs are seen at $420-$430 million. This results in operating earnings of just around $187 million at the midpoint of the guidance.Sales for the upcoming year are seen at $6.50 billion to $6.80 billion, which at the midpoint suggests that sales are seen flat. GAAP margins are seen at 45% to 46%. Combined with targeted operating expenses at $1.715 billion to $1.730 billion and additional expenses of another $80 million, operating earnings are seen around $1.22 billion. This means that assuming statutory taxes and relatively low interest expenses, net earnings are seen at just around $750 million.The guidance for both the current quarter and year is very disappointing. Consensus estimate for the first quarter stood at $1.6 billion while analysts were looking for full-year revenues in 2015 of more than $7.2 billion.Fair Valuation, Supported By A Rock Solid Balance SheetSanDisk continues to operate with a rock solid balance sheet. Total cash holdings, marketable securities and long-term investments come in at $5.0 billion while the total debt load, including convertible debt, stands at $2.2 billion.The company has 235 million shares outstanding, assuming full dilution of convertible debt of course, or about 17 million shares less assuming no full dilution. The 235 million shares value SanDisk at $17.6 billion with shares trading at $75 per share. Assuming non-conversion of convertible debt, the valuation comes in at $16.3 billion. Now subtract to that $2.8 billion in net cash being held, and operating assets are valued at just $13.5 billion.Over the past year, SanDisk has posted sales of $6.63 billion on which it net earned $1.01 billion. This results in appealing multiples at 2 times revenues and just 13-14 times earnings.Concluding RemarksAt around $75 per share, shares of SanDisk have lost about 30% from the highs seen in 2014. To comfort investors to some degree, SanDisk is now resorting to putting its huge cash balances to work. The company announced a new $2.5 billion share repurchase program, putting the total authorization to $3 billion. This is sufficient to buy back some 40 million shares, or over 15% of the outstanding share base at current levels. On top of this comes the $0.30 per share quarterly dividend, sufficient to provide investors with another 1.5% dividend yield.These payouts are necessary to convince shareholders to not sell their holdings at current times. The company is well positioned to do so, given its $5 billion war chest in terms of cash and investments. The trouble is that the one-time issues, for which the company blamed the shortfall in the fourth quarter, are continuing into 2015. As such, the weakness is not caused simply by one-time items but appears more structural and this has ""killed"" all the growth ambitions for 2015, with earnings expected to be down.For these reasons, I feel it is still relatively early in SanDisk's downturn, with more pressure on the removable storage business to be expected. While payouts and a fair valuation can support the shares to a great degree after they have fallen some 30% already, I am cautious. Earnings will take another beating this year, and I would suspect that we have not seen the lows in the share price yet.For these reasons, I am cautious to buy into the shares at these levels, although the risk-reward appeal has improved significantly compared to a few months ago."
2845996,76475,2015-01-24T17:29:25-05:00,"Both SanDisk and its contemporary Micron have been hurt by falling NAND prices.The two companies, however, are enjoying robust growth in the hot SSD market.SanDisk is more likely to be favored by SSD revenue due its smaller revenue base and sound SSD strategy.","Advanced semiconductor solution providers SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) and Micron (NASDAQ: MU) are large NAND chip players that have been hurt by falling NAND prices. NAND chips are used in storage drives, cameras, smartphones and tablets. The two, however, also share a bright spot - they are some of the largest players in the red-hot SSD market. The question that begs answering is which of the two companies stand to benefit the most from the rapidly-growing SSD market, both in the near-term and short-term?Shares of both companies are some of the most volatile in the tech industry. This can partly be attributed to the unusually high level of institutional ownership of both companies' shares - 100% for SanDisk and 95% for Micron. SanDisk shares had a rollercoaster ride in 2014, at one point selling off by as much as 20% in mid-July before making a strong comeback and finishing the year up by around 45%. Meanwhile, Micron has a similar rollercoaster ride, but managed to finish the year around 60% up. Over the long-term, Micron shares have tended to underperform those of SanDisk, though not by much - the shares have tucked on gains of 238% over the last five years compared to 264% for SanDisk. Over the long-term, both have been good investments without much to pick between them.Year-to-date, SanDisk shares have sold off by a large margin of 19.3% while Micron shares are down 11.1%.SSD Market SharesFor revenue from SSD products to be able to offset weaknesses in both companies' core products such as NAND and DRAM, it will have to comprise a significant proportion of either company's overall revenue. NAND flash revenue clocked in at 27% for Micron and 24% for SanDisk (embedded products that use NAND flash) in 2014. The two companies therefore have significant exposure to the cyclical business. The current weakness of the NAND market is not expected to ease anytime soon. Samsung (OTC: OTC:SSNLF) commercialized 3D NAND in 2014. 3D NAND as well as TLC (Triple-Level Cell) NAND are both expected to gradually become more mainstream and slowly push MLC (Multi-Level Cell) NAND to the sidelines. Traditionally, TLC has mainly been used in flash memory cards, USB drives, client SSDs and low-cost smartphones. TLC is, however, beginning to be used in high-end smartphones such as iPhone 6 as well as enterprise data center SSDs. Even though SanDisk and Samsung sell TLC, the product is priced at just 80% of MLC, meaning the transition to TLC is likely to take a hit on both.Gartner released the figures for SSD revenue for the leading vendors in June. The research firm is yet to release any new figures this year. This is how Gartner ranked the SSD leaders:Source: The RegisterGartner added that the SSD market grew 53.1% in 2013 to hit $10.9 billion (enterprise SSDs+client SSDs).Judging from the graph provided, it's quite easy to see that SanDisk enjoys a much larger SSD revenue than Micron. SanDisk announced during its fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 results that its SSD revenue had now reached 29% of its overall revenue, or $1.92 billion, implying a 50.5% year-on-year growth compared to the previous year when SSD revenue was $1.27 billion. The SSD segment is now SanDisk's fastest growing.Meanwhile, Micron has not specifically revealed how much SSD revenue it received in fiscal 2014. We can, however, use the graph provided as a proxy. A significant proportion of SanDisk's SSD growth can be chalked up to its June acquisition of Fusion-io, meaning it's rather unlikely that Micron could have matched it since its SSD growth is purely organic. IHS iSupply predicted that the SSD market would grow at 40% in 2014 and 2015. Assuming that Micron's growth was close to that figure, then the company probably realized SSD revenue of $1.052 billion in 2014, translating to 6.4% of its overall revenue.SanDisk's SSD revenue makes up a much more significant part of its overall revenue than Micron's. If SanDisk maintains SSD growth of 30% going forward while its other segments maintain their current growth rate, it would take about 2.5 years for SSD revenue to comprise 50% of SanDisk's overall revenue. Once the company's SSD revenue reaches 40% (that would take about five quarters assuming a 30% growth rate) of its overall revenue, it will be enough to help the company grow its topline in double digits.Micron has a much larger revenue base than SanDisk, implying that its SSD revenue would take much longer to get to a level where it would impact tangibly on its topline growth.SSD StrategyOther than raw numbers, it's important for investors to consider the SSD strategies of both companies as well as the competitive threats from large players such Samsung and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).The current industry trend seems to favor vertical integration. I would argue that SanDisk's SSDs sport better vertical integration than Micron. The company's Flashsoft software and Guardian Technology Platform as well as its comprehensive IP portfolio help it offer a complete value chain in SSD products. This ensures that the company has a continuous supply of enterprise-level SSD components. Server and storage vendors prefer SSD vendors with consistent supply that helps them scale up and expand their workloads in the datacenter without any interruptions in the supply chain. Meanwhile, Micron's SSD strategy seems to be defined by cramming PCIe components into finished products.One area where Micron has a slight advantage over SanDisk as far as SSDs go lies in the fact that the company fully owns its NAND fabs whereas SanDisk co-owns its fabs with Toshiba. NAND is a critical component of SSDs.When it comes to competition, the two companies are likely to face more competitive pressure from the likes of Intel and Hewlett Packard (NYSE: HPQ). Intel is the second-largest SSD vendor behind only Samsung. The company already boasts an impressive array of SSD products. Intel unveiled low-priced PCIe products at Computex last year. Give the rather thin crop of PCIe SSDs and Intel's competitive pricing, it's not hard to see the products gaining traction rapidly.Source: DigitalTrendsConclusionGiven the NAND headwinds facing both companies, I would pick Micron shares over SanDisk's over the short-term based solely on the fact that shares of pricier stocks tend to do much worse in a market downturn compared to shares of their cheaper brethren (SanDisk shares trade at a one-year forward PE ratio of 17.59 compared to 7.85 for Micron). Over the medium-to-long-term, SanDisk is much more likely to win given its higher SSD revenue and smaller revenue base that allow SSD revenue to easily offset weaknesses in its other businesses. The volatility of both companies' shares makes them great plays for short-term investors, as exemplified by Micron's chart below.Source: NASDAQEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

2840976,47631,2015-01-22T11:07:36-05:00,"The supply constraint in the retail SSD segment has affected Sandisk's overall revenue. Moreover, the loss of a major client in the client SSD segment is also a big concern.Though these are considerable challenges, they are temporary in nature. The company itself expects top line growth to come to track by the beginning of 2016.Since Sandisk has not put all the eggs in a single basket, investors can expect damage minimization due to the counter effect of gains in the enterprise and embedded solutions.Investor's should focus on Sandisk's strong fundamentals and bright opportunities in SSD markets. The current weaknesses will subside after a while.","The shares of Sandisk (SNDK), a leading data storage company, fell about 6.2 percent in AH trading because of disappointing results. Before I proceed, please note that I do not put any particular emphasis on AH data, simply because they represent temporary and usually panic-driven market reactions to stock-related news. That being said, the pessimistic perception towards Sandisk is prima facie justified, as the storage devices giant reported a lackluster fourth quarter and offered weak guidance for the first half of fiscal 2015.SNDK price data by YChartsDetailed resultsThe primary reason that drove down Sandisk's performance in the fourth quarter can be attributed to supply constraints in retail SSD, which led to the loss of sales opportunities. The fourth quarter revenue was almost flat, both sequentially and year-over-year. To be precise, the revenue grew by 0.43 percent on a Y-o-Y basis to $1.74 billion, in alignment with company's revised projection of $1.73 billion, but much lower than its earlier forecast of $1.8 to $1.85 billion. As a consequence of a weak topline growth in the quarter, Sandisk reported a massive plunge of about 40 percent in profits. In three months that ended on December 28th, the company earned $201.8 million or $0.86 per share, compared with $337.8 million or $1.45 per share for the prior year period. For full-year 2014, the numbers got distorted because of a poor Q4 performance. The revenue for fiscal 2014 grew by 7 percent and the Non-GAAP earnings by 5 percent (including the dilutive impact of Fusion-io acquisition).As I mentioned above, the supply constraint in the quarter hit Sandisk's overall performance, especially the retail SSD segment. The contribution of retail to overall revenue stood at 31 percent, as compared to 38 percent in the prior year period. Owing to the unplanned maintenance at company's Yokkaichi fab facility and lower yield on a memory dye (production component), the output fell below the expected level. The below-mentioned excerpt from the earnings transcript highlights the damage to retail SSD's performance because of limited supply of products.The management estimates that the first half of fiscal 2015 will be spent in recovering from the headwinds caused due to supply constraints. Lower revenue contribution by the retail SSD segment also hampered the overall margins because the retail segment products get higher margins than the commercial SSD segment. To add to these woes, Sandisk also cited the loss of a big customer in the client SSD segment, who moved away from company's SSD solutions. In my opinion though, these are temporary challenges. The bright side here is that the challenges have been caused by company's internal and controllable processes. As such, the probability of recovery from such headwinds is comparatively greater when compared to the macro level challenges, which are generally not within full control of an enterprise.The outlookBesides the fact that the company estimates its retail SSD division to start growing as expected from the second half of 2015, the outlook looks quite acceptable. The CEO of Sandisk, Sanjay Mehrotra, has expressed high confidence in enterprise and embedded solutions to become the key drivers of revenue growth in fiscal 2015. Even in the fourth quarter, both of these segments exhibited strong performance. For embedded solutions, the increase in adoption of Sandisk's X3 solutions at major OEM customers is a positive news as it will generate greater gains in coming quarters. However, it is significant for investors to note that an increase in the volume of embedded solutions might negatively impact the blended margins. This is because, embedded solutions also offer lower margins as compared to other segments.CFO Judy Bruner has estimated that the company will return to profitability ratio of 25 to 30 percent of revenue in the second half of 2015. In addition to that, he has also expressed his intent to spend at least 100 percent of 2015 free cash flow on their capital return program. I would take his word for it because, the data shows that the capital return program of the company equaled 103 percent of Sandisk's FCF of $1.5 billion, in 2014. Under the said program, the company spend 235 million in dividends and repurchased a whopping 14.3 million shares.Final wordsUndoubtedly, Sandisk has strong fundamentals, but the current challenges have hampered growth on the top and bottom lines. However, these are short-term challenges that would subside after a while. Investors should look at the bright side of Sandisk's earnings report to discover the immense potential in company's SSD products, both commercial and retail. If there is a reasonable pullback in the share price (the decline in AH trading suggests there could be), it would create a comparatively lucrative entry point, which investors should not miss.Note: The US markets were closed for trading at the time of writing."

(SNDK) provided a business update that missed analysts' consensus. As a result, SanDisk's stock dropped 13.88% on the same day and another 3.08% on January 13. Since its peak price of $106.00, on December 08, the stock has fallen 23.6%. However, since the beginning of 2014, SNDK's stock has gained 14.8% while the S&P 500 Index has increased 9.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 11.6%.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.In its business update, the company estimates total revenue to be approximately $1.73 billion, lower than the previously forecasted revenue range of $1.80 billion to $1.85 billion. The lower revenue was primarily due to weaker than expected sales of retail and iNAND products. Non-GAAP gross margin for the fourth fiscal quarter is expected to be approximately 45% compared to the previously guided range of 47% to 49%.iNAND products are embedded chips sold to Samsung, Lenovo, Huawei, and others, but not Apple to which it sells ""custom embedded chips"" which are lower-margin. Declining tablet growth and softer sales of Samsung's and others' non-Apple smartphones in emerging markets weighed on sales of embedded iNAND mobile-device chips. Although sales of Apple iPhones have been very strong, SanDisk's shift to the lower-margin chips negatively impacted margins.In my opinion, investors' reaction to the news has been exaggerated, and the current price provides an especially good opportunity to buy the stock at a relatively cheap price.Although there is a temporary glut of NAND memories in the market, SanDisk will benefit from favorable market conditions for NAND memories for the long term. One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the high demand for smartphones across the globe. Apple users are upgrading to iPhones with more storage capacity, and emerging device makers embed more SanDisk chips into future phones. In addition, continued growth in flash demand from cloud-service data farms and the ongoing transition away from HDDs and toward SSDs in client PC and server markets will contribute to the growth in the demand for NAND Flash Memory. In my opinion, there is significant upside potential for SanDisk.SanDisk will report its fourth quarter 2014 financial results on January 21. According to thirty one analysts' average estimate, the company is expected to post a profit of $1.30 a share, a 24% decline from its actual earnings for the same quarter a year ago. The highest estimate is for a profit of $1.71 a share while the lowest is for a profit of $1.15 a share. Over the last 30 days, there were25 down revisions and one up revision. Although the fourth quarter estimate results might disappoint investors, I believe that long-term prospects of the company remain bright.In previous quarters, SanDisk has shown a significant earnings per share surprise in each one of the last four quarters as shown in the table below.Data: Yahoo Finance - Analyst EstimatesValuationSanDisk's ttm Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is pretty low at 7.86, and its long-term PEG Ratio is very low at 0.63, the second lowest among all S&P 500 tech stocks, only Avago Technologies (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a lower long-term PEG Ratio. See my article about AVGO.Source: Portfolio123The PEG ratio - price/earnings to growth ratio - is a widely used indicator of a stock's potential value. It is favored by many investors over the P/E ratio because it also accounts for growth. A lower PEG means that the stock is more undervalued.Moreover, SNDK's Margins and Return on Capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median and the S&P 500 median as shown in the tables below.Source: Portfolio123ConclusionAlthough SanDisk's preannouncement was disappointing, and there is a temporary glut of NAND memories in the market, long-term market conditions for the NAND memories are favorable. In my view, after the retreat in its stock price, it is now an excellent opportunity for a long-term investment in SNDK's stock at a relatively cheap price. SanDisk has compelling valuation metrics and very strong earnings growth prospects. Its Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is very low at 7.86, and its PEG ratio is extremely low at 0.63. Furthermore, the company demonstrated significant improvement in its profitability during the last four quarters. All these factors bring me to the conclusion that SNDK stock is a smart long-term investment."
2828216,24663,2015-01-18T16:29:35-05:00,"A recovery in PC shipments is now evident.Rather than picking which PC-related stock will benefit, it's better to own a large piece of a PC-related industry.STX and WDC are great choices with their HDD market share and investments outside of PCs.","Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) fourth quarter report tells investors a lot of things, with one being that PC shipments continue to recover. In the second and third quarters, investors saw flashes of a potential PC recovery, but with Intel noting a 6% increase in volume in its PC CPU division during its last quarter, it is becoming even more apparent that moderate growth is here to stay. Not to mention, Gartner's recent estimate that global PC shipments increased 1% further adds to the notion of a recovery. Due to this performance, companies Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) might very well have a lot to gain.Why Seagate and Western Digital? The simple answer is because both have complete exposure to the PC market along with a growing presence in other markets that have performed quite well in recent years. One thing investors must consider is that strong performance in the PC space is not yet widespread. The strength of the industry can be traced back to commercial PCs, notebooks and Chromebooks, with consumer PCs finally starting to show some balance after steep multi-year declines in shipments. As a result, volatility and unpredictable sales are often associated with today's PC-related marketplace.This fact makes investments in the space risky. For example, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) controls nearly 20% of the PC space, but is its 20% outperforming or underperforming the broader industry? This is the question that must be answered when looking at big PC-related companies. Another example is the strength of Intel's business and the poor performance of AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Examples like this can be found throughout the industry, where one competitor performs well and the other lags, and then it reverses.That said, hard disk drives (HDDs) are a high-margin business and a necessary storage requirement for PCs, and Western Digital and Seagate Technology own about 85% of the market combined. That gives investors near total exposure to the PC space by holding two different stocks, which might be the best way to play the recovery in PCs.A perfect illustration of why it is wise to own both Western Digital and Seagate in a portfolio can be seen in their market share performance over the last year. From January 2013 through July 2014 Seagate's share of the HDD market fell from 43% to 39%. In the same period, Western Digital's rose from 43.6% to 45.7%.This increase in share for Western Digital is a likely result of its leading presence with enterprise drives. During its last quarter Western Digital shipped over seven million enterprise drives, an increase of nearly threefold from the same period three years ago. Meanwhile, Seagate has made larger investments in non-PC applications over the last couple years, affecting its HDD market share, but also growing its emerging businesses with SSDs and other storage products.Albeit, Seagate Technology continues to hold a strong grasp on the consumer side of HDDs, and also in data centers. During its most recent quarter, Seagate's market share rose to 40% while Western Digital's declined to 44%. While some attribute Seagate's strong performance to its launch of the first ever 8TB drive and other high-performance HDDs, the point is that future market share performance of one company or the other is hard to predict, if not impossible.Regardless, for investors who own one stock or the other, the volatility that comes with quarter-to-quarter market share between Seagate and Western Digital must be considered as an influence to the respective stock price. Instead of trying to predict which company might gain more market share from quarter-to-quarter, the best idea is likely to invest in both, and gain exposure to the overwhelming majority of the HDD market as PC sales continue to stabilize and grow.All things considered, there is one final reason that both Western Digital and Seagate Technology are good investments as plays on the PC. That is their innate ability to evolve and reward shareholders for their patience. Six years ago, the overwhelming majority of Western Digital and Seagate's revenue came from PC applications, or HDDs sold for PC use; well over 85%. But, with desktop shipments falling by roughly 25% over the last three years, both companies have had to become more creative to counter those losses.Today, nearly half of Seagate's shipments come from non-PC applications, and almost 40% for Western Digital. This shows that Seagate and Western Digital are no longer dependent on a strong PC market to survive. However, with a combined 85% share of the HDD market, both companies would certainly thrive in a market with strong PC shipments. As a result, investors should really like both companies, not just one, but both as a way to gain exposure to nearly all of the HDD market. At 11 and 12 times forward earnings, respectively, Seagate and Western Digital present a value investment opportunity not often seen in today's market. Two stocks ready to surge in a strong PC environment, but that can still thrive without continued PC gains due to smart investments and diversification. Hence, Seagate plus Western Digital is a wise, safe and potentially lucrative investment combination long-term."
2819276,31441,2015-01-14T04:07:26-05:00,"SanDisk warned fourth quarter revenue would be at least 6% below previous estimates.
        Weaker sales occurred in the retail channel and in iNAND products (from 24% - 32% of revenue).
        Industry chatter suggests Samsung's crumbling smartphone sales left it with excess NAND supply, which it dumped onto the market.
        Declining pricing power and gross margins are not expected to abate any time soon. Investors should avoid SanDisk.","Monday SanDisk (SNDK) warned its fourth quarter revenue would come in less than expected, sparking concerns that the supply/demand dynamics in the smartphone chip supply market has been disrupted. The stock is off over 16% to $81 per share since that time. The company estimates total revenue of $1.73 billion - 6% less than the $1.85 billion previously forecasted and the $1.84 billion analysts were expecting. The lower revenue was primarily due to weaker sales of retail and iNAND products. The company also said fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be approximately 45% compared to previous guidance of 47% to 49%.iNAND Revenue Weakness Is AlarmingiNAND products mainly consists of flash memory for tablet and smartphone manufacturers. The warning of iNAND is particularly sobering given the fact that in 2014 the sales of smartphones and tablets continued to grow and with it, demand for more storage capacity from consumers. It begs the question, ""If SanDisk cannot grow iNAND revenue when demand for storage is increasing, what happens when demand is tamped down?""Samsung NAND Supply Increase At Fault?Falling NAND prices may be the result of increased supply at Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF). According to statista, Samsung is the leading NAND flash memory manufacturer with 30% market share, followed by Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY) (23%), SanDisk (19%) and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) (12%). However, Samsung's smartphone operations have been crumbling due to competitive pressures from the likes of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Xiaomi and Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGY). Since Samsung also supplies NAND products to its smartphone division, sagging smartphone sales may have created excess supply of NAND which Samsung dumped onto the market. According to the Firstadopter Column:If Samsung continues to over-estimate demand for its smartphones, it may consistently end up with a glut of NAND products, further compressing prices. Secondly, as Apple continues to take share away from Samsung in smartphones, it gives Apple additional leverage over NAND suppliers. I described such Apple Overhang in my previous article:That said, the margin compression for SanDisk and other NAND manufacturers may not abate any time soon.Avoid SanDiskThe two areas of revenue weakness are iNAND products and the retail segment. SanDisk's marketing materials imply that iNAND embedded flash drives are used in smartphones and tablets. According to the company's quarterly metric data, 24% of Q3 2014 revenue came from embedded products. Secondly, about 32% came from the retail segment, implying that from 24% - 32% of the company's revenue could be negatively impacted by the declining revenue and margins. The following charts illustrate the company's revenue mix at Q3 2014:Revenue By ProductRevenue By ChannelConclusionSanDisk's revenue weakness and margin compression will most likely impact 24% - 32% of revenue. Secondly, I don't expect the poor pricing environment to abate anytime soon. Investors should continue to avoid SanDisk.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

2810295,21702,2015-01-10T17:08:33-05:00,WDC is a cash cow that reported FCF of $667 million in Q1 FY15 and a net cash position of over $3.2 billion ($13.33/share).The full integration of the HGST division this year will lead to estimated annual cost savings of ~$500 million.The company could earn $9/share in FY15 for a forward P/E=12 and yields 1.5%.WDC is a BUY with a $130 price target for 2015 and is an excellent long-term core technology holding.,"Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is a leading designer and manufacturer of hard disk drives (""HDD"") and digital storage solutions. The company sells HDDs, networking equipment, and home entertainment products under the WD, HGST (Hitachi Global Storage Technologies), and G-Technology brands. WDC's products are found in enterprise and cloud data centers, client servers, consumer electronics, and home and business offices. WDC has a ~45% market share and has demonstrated an ability to deliver consistent and strong financial returns. As a result, the company has amassed $3.2 billion in net cash ($13.33/share). EBITDA grew 20% yoy and the company is buying back shares. WDC is a BUY and should hit $130/share over the next 12 months (+20%). The company pays out a 1.5% dividend and prospects for dividend growth are excellent.One reason WDC is thriving is thanks to a near duopoly in the HDD market. After Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) bought Samsung Electronics' hard drive division in 2011, Western Digital acquired Hitachi's hard drive business in 2012 for $4.5 billion. As a result, WDC and Seagate dominate the HDD market with both companies owning a near 45% share.Let's begin an analysis of WDC by looking at the company's latest quarterly results and seeing how it has been able to build up such a large pile of cash.Q1 2015 EarningsQ1 FY15 earnings were released on October 28th, 2014 for the quarter ended October 3, 2014. The Q1 financial statement indicates a solidly profitable quarter with relatively flat yoy revenue and gross profit:Diluted net income per share was down 14% primarily due to an increase in total operating expenses - R&D expenditures were up $36 million and SG&A was up a whopping 67%. Had SG&A simply remained flat, EPS would have been $0.36/share higher. The higher SG&A is largely the result of the company's HGST subsidiary. More on that later.From the Q1 FY15 EPS press release, we learned the company bought back 2.2 million shares at a cost of $223 million, which works out to an average price of $101.36/share (the stock closed yesterday at $108). On Oct. 15, the company paid a $0.40 per common share dividend. The yield is 1.5%.From the Q1 quarterly fact sheet, WDC's unit shipments were up modestly to 64.7 million and its HDD market share ticked up to ~44%. Gross margins have been relatively stable at 28-29% for many quarters since the HGST deal in 2012:The company ended Q1 with $5.16 billion in cash and cash equivalents - with a net cash position of over $3.2 billion ($13.33 per diluted share). Free cash flow for Q1 was very strong at $667 million - up 21% over the prior quarter's FCF of $552 million. The company has $923 million left on its existing shareholder repurchase plan. At the current price, that equates to ~8.6 million shares, or roughly 3.6% of the total diluted share count.Other significant notes from the quarterly fact sheet:Lastly, but perhaps most significantly of all, EBITDA for FY14 grew to $3.035 billion - up 21% over FY13's $2.499 billion.Now let's take a look at the important HGST division.Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST)HGST has a long and storied history as a technology leader in the HDD market going back to the IBM 3340 mainframe in the 1970s. According to a September 9, 2014 HGST presentation by WDC, some notable industry ""firsts"" include:Today, HGST is shipping the ULTRASTAR 7K6000 - a 6TB 3.5"" 2 million hour MTBF HDD for the mainstream enterprise and cloud data market. It is the world's first helium filled and sealed 6 TB HDD. Recently, WDC announced the highest capacity HDD drive in the world and is also sampling a 10TB helium sealed 3.5"" HDD cold storage solution, another industry first.HGST also provides solid state drives (""SSD"") and rack based large scale storage systems (>10 Petabytes per rack) for data centers. WDC has a strategic technology relationship with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which will keep it on the leading edge of SSD technology. In December, note that WDC & HGST recently announced the purchase of Skyera, a developer of solid-state storage systems for scale-out cloud and enterprise data centers. News of the acquisition was bullishly received for the intellectual talent Skyera brings to HGST with its flash engineering capabilities. Brean Capital's Ananda Baruah said the deal is ""very strategic in nature"" and that Western Digital has amassed quite a collection of flash technology:Clearly, HGST has been an innovative technology leader in the HDD market and provides scalable solutions from market top-to-bottom. The company is also making swift technological in-roads in the fast growing large-scale SSD market. There is just one problem...When WDC acquired HGST in 2012, China's Ministry of Commerce (""MOFCOM"") required WDC to submit a detailed operating plan to keep R&D, marketing, and production separate and to insure manufacturing would be kept at existing production facilities for a period of 24 months after the acquisition. As a result, WDC could realize HGST generated revenues, but for all intents and purposes, HGST was a separate entity. That was 34 months ago. Along the way, MOFCOM identified two ""non-compliance"" issues with the origination agreement, which caused integration delays.The good news came last month when WDC announced it had successfully resolved two non-compliance matters with MOFCOM as part of its ongoing and constructive dialogue with the agency. The company said while it cannot predict whether or when the agency will lift the hold separate condition, MOFCOM has indicated to the company that it is now ""fully focused on considering Western Digital's application to lift the restriction.""Upside PotentialThe MOFCOM announcement was significant in that once integration of the two companies is approved, WDC will be able to reap significant cost savings. An analyst in this Barron's article suggests cost savings of >$400 million with a 20% boost in EPS. This is why I highlighted the SG&A line item in the Q1 EPS report (see above). A Forbes article last month suggested the savings could be more on the order of ~$600 million. The average of the two analysts is for ~$500 million in cost savings, which equates to an EPS boost of over $2.00/share. Considering WDC earned $6.68/share for FY14, the company could earn close to $9/share this year if the restrictions are lifted in Q1. If we put a P/E=15 on those earnings, we get a stock price of $135. While I do believe indications are strong that the separation restriction will be lifted this year, I will back off that price target some due to lack of visibility in the exact timing. My PT is $130.Even if MOFCOM doesn't move soon, WDC still has a very bright future. Digital data is the currency of the new economy. As shown earlier, WDC is leading the market in new state-of-the-art products. The company has a plethora of new market niches to tap. Just to name a few: set-top boxes for next-gen TV, DVRs, automotive entertainment systems, security and surveillance systems, gaming consoles, and of course the cloud and enterprise data.The growth in storage demand is expected to keep accelerating (see chart below). When you combine this robust market growth, with a duopoly participant holding a 45% market share, you get a very bullish future.Source: IDC as shown in December presentation.In my first article on the company (WDC: I Spy An Opportunity) in July of 2013, I discussed the bullish catalyst of the NSA's storage requirements for its eavesdropping programs. The stock was at $67.53 at the time and I put a BUY recommendation on shares with PT of $100. The stock closed yesterday at ~$108. Shortly after that article, I questioned the bullish consensus that IBM (NYSE:IBM) was going to be a big winner in large scale storage solutions (IBM: The Best Investment In Metadata Storage Solutions) and suggested that WDC would continue to outperform IBM:We now know that IBM's pain was WDC's gain (see stock price comparison at right). Of course there are many reasons that IBM has been performing so poorly in comparison to WDC, but storage systems is certainly surely one of them. For IBM's Q3 earnings, System Storage revenues were actually down -6%. Of all the strategic moves IBM has made over the years trying to reinvent itself, selling its HDD business to Hitachi in 2003 was likely its biggest blunder in my opinion.This interesting Forbes article (Cycle Computing Pushes The Boundaries Of Computation Scale) shows the power of WDC's storage systems. This is the type of technology we would routinely see IBM involved in, but instead - now it is WDC.Shareholder Returns CommitmentBut back to the upside potential in WDC - specifically, shareholder returns. Note in the Seeking Alpha Q1 conference call transcript Western Digital CEO & President Stephen Milligan reiterated the company's capital allocation policy:With FCF of $2.19 billion in FY14, this bodes well for shareholders going forward, with 50% being ~$1.1 billion that should go to shareholders. The current annual dividend of $1.60/share amounts to only $384 million. If we add in the remaining (current) share buyback program ($923 million), we're just about square with management's commitment. However, note if the 50% geared to shareholders was split 50/50 between dividends and buybacks, the dividend rate would be more on the order of $2.30/share, versus today's $1.60. As the share price rises as it has been, one would think management would tend to direct more of the FCF to dividends, and a $2.30/share dividend based on the 50/50 split would equate to a 40% increase in the dividend over today's $1.60. And of course if the HGST integration does yield cost savings of ~$500 million, that's another ~$1/share that should feed through to shareholders (i.e. 50% would be $250 million and there are 240 million diluted shares outstanding).Plus, remember, WDC already has over $3.2 billion ($13/share) in net cash. The bottom line here is that current annual FCF, cash on hand, and capital efficiencies once WDC is allowed to integrate HGST, will lead to significant increases in the shareholder returns going forward - ideally more as dividends. However, even if management keeps the current over-emphasis on share buybacks, that will boost per share EPS. Regardless, 2015 appears set-up for significant upgrades in both the dividend and share buyback plans.RisksRisks to my recommendation and PT are a general slowdown in the world economy, lower personal computer unit growth, and slower adoption of HDDs. However, one look at the latest quarterly numbers show PC units are actually increasing - surprising those expecting tablets to take over the world. Of course, tablets also need storage and WDC's SDD drives will penetrate that market as well. Regardless, one reason cited for the growth in PC unit shipments in 2014 was Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) decision to stop supporting Windows XP. This worked to the advantage of companies like WDC and Intel, which both performed strongly last year, as the PC user base using XP upgraded their machines. Gartner recently estimated PC units will continue to grow in 2015 (up 1%) while the tablet sales growth rates continues to slow. So PC units will continue to provide a strong foundation for WDC as it focuses more on higher margin, large scale storage systems for enterprise solutions, cloud data centers, and entertainment.The biggest risk to my outlook for WDC would be market disappointment of a potential announcement from MOFCOM suggesting longer than expected delays to the integration or additional ""non conformance"" issues. In that case, shares could easily fall ~10-15%.Upside risks include an integration announcement and/or expansion of the P/E due to accelerating digital storage solutions demand. Expansion of the P/E combined with HGST integration cost savings and WDC's continued solid quarterly financials, with perhaps a significant boost in the dividend, could lead the stock to ~$140-150 in 2015.Summary & ConclusionsWDC enjoys sharing a fast growing market for digital storage devices with only one other company, both of which have a relatively equal 45% market share. WDC's HGST division has a long and storied history as an innovative technology leader in the HDD market. Full integration of HGST into the WDC fold could lead to annual cost savings of ~$500 million, or ~$2/share. As a result, 2015 EPS should grow to ~$9/share. At yesterday's close of $108, that is a forward P/E of only 12 for a company that grew EBITDA by 21% last year. In addition, the company is simply a cash cow with FCF of $667 million in Q1 FY and over $3.2 billion in net cash ($13.33/share). The company is shareholder friendly with a commitment to return 50% of FCF to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks. Add it all together and WDC is a technology leader that could turn into a great long-term dividend growth stock. The potential of the full integration of HGST is very likely to happen soon and is a powerful catalyst for significant annual cost savings and EPS growth on the order of 20%. The company has $923 million left on its existing share repurchase plan and currently yields 1.5%.WDC is a BUY with a $130 PT."
2746255,76475,2014-12-11T13:30:05-05:00,"SanDisk operational performance has been gradually improving since its historic $2 billion loss of 2008.SanDisk issued soft revenue guidance for the current fiscal year which spooked investors and took a hit on its shares.The long-term outlook for the company, however, remains good due to the company’s strong position in the rapidly growing SSD market and higher NAND chip demand.","SanDisk's (SNDK) operational performance has improved considerably ever since its 2008 nadir when the company posted a shocking $2 billion loss. Its recovery has not been smooth, however. The company has had numerous ups and downs, but the general long-term trend has been positive. The volatility in the company's performance is reflected in its share performance. The shares peaked in 2006 at around $60 before plunging to just $7 in 2008 following the record loss. Despite being on a roller coaster in the current year, SanDisk shares have been standout performers. The shares sold off by close to 20% in mid-July after the company issued weak revenue guidance for the year. The shares have, however, recovered quite nicely and are up 48% year-to-date. SanDisk shares exhibit so much volatility partly due to the unusually high percentage of institutional ownership of the shares - 96.5%.I, however, remain optimistic about the company's long-term prospects guided by the following factors:SSD GrowthSanDisk is the 3rd largest SSD vendor after Samsung and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC). According to Gartner, the company's SSD revenue quadrupled in 2013 to reach $1.17 billion in 2013, or 19% of the company's overall revenue.Source: The RegisterDuring the first half of the current fiscal year, SanDisk's SSD revenue grew even further and now accounts for 29% of the company's revenue. The best part of the SSD growth is that it has had a positive impact on the company's gross margin. SanDisk's gross margin improved 1320 basis points from 33.3% in fiscal 2013 to 46.5% in fiscal 2014. Although the company does not reveal the margins on its SSD products, it appears as if the improvement is attributable to the healthy SSD growth.Research firm HIS iSupply predicts that the SSD market will see 40% growth in 2014 and 2015, which is good news for SanDisk.The only reason why the margin expansion has not reflected on its bottom line is because of the company's operating expenses and growth that has greatly outpaced sales growth. R&D expenses grew 21.5% year-on-year to $223.3 million during the third quarter of the current fiscal year, while selling and marketing expenses were up 54.2% to $11.4 million. Meanwhile, revenue grew 7% during the quarter.The diversification into SSDs has two main positive impacts on SanDisk. First off, the company no longer has to rely too heavily on a single customer for a big chunk of its revenue. Previously, SanDisk derived approximately 20% of its revenue from selling NAND chips to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). With a new revenue stream contributing almost 30% of its topline, SanDisk is in a better position to hedge its bets by compensating the cyclicality of both businesses with growth in one business when the other is not doing too well. The second positive impact is the gross margin expansion I have demonstrated above.Better SSD ProductsSanDisk's SSDs sport better vertical integration than those of its main competitors. The company bought out SMART Storage in June 2013 and this gives it a headstart in FlashDIMM. FlashDimm features even lower latency than PCIe cards, and has been slated to become the next big thing in the flash landscape. SanDisk will unveil its FlashDIMM products in 2015.Intel has an impressive line of SSD products to its name including Pro 2500 and P3000 PCIe flash cards that use an NVMe interface with capacities of up to 2TB. The company launched an impressive family of PCIe cards at Computex this year. The chip giant, however, does not seem to be keen on moving up the flash stack and is instead focusing more energy on developing flash DIMMs.Meanwhile, Micron's (NASDAQ:MU) SSD strategy seems to be cramming PCIe flash components into finished products. The industry trend on the other hand favors vertical integration.Higher Demand for Flash Memory in Mobile PhonesApple's decision to double flash memory in iPhone 6 has resulted in its competitors Samsung and HTC to follow suit. Apple increased NAND storage for the iPhone 6 to 64GB and 128GB for iPhone 6 Plus, double the flash allocation for the previous generation. This marked the first time Apple increased the flash storage of its mid-end iPhones since 2009. iPhone 6 has been racking up huge sales due to pent up demand after lackluster demand for iPhone 5S/5C.The move has compelled some its competitors to follow suit in a bid to remain competitive. Samsung is expected to unveil a new Galaxy S6 with more flash memory in March of next year. The NAND industry where SanDisk belongs will likely see higher demand and better prices for NAND chips.Additionally, SanDisk plans to launch its 3D NAND chips in 2015 and ramp up production in 2016.Bottom LineSanDisk has managed to establish itself as a respectable SSD player in the space of just two years. This will help the company balance the cyclicality of its NAND business. Meanwhile, the move by leading smartphone manufacturers including Apple and Samsung to increase their flash storage will lead to tighter supply of the chips and better prices."
2745815,34001,2014-12-10T11:14:06-05:00,"Number of exabytes (1 exabyte = 1 million gigabytes) used in cloud computing and enterprise data is set to overtake usage in personal and small business data by 2020.Hardware and storage industry has outperformed the S&P 500 by 65% over the past five years, and 22% over the past three years.WDC making strategic acquisitions to increase its share of the flash memory market.","With the increase in cloud computing and big data analytics by business, the future looks bright for manufacturers of data-farm equipment. In particular, there is an increasing need for storage that is both denser in its form factor and more efficient in its use of power. The companies that are poised to benefit most from this in the long term are those that have the ability to manufacture in volume and able to pivot from fabricating hard disk drives to fabricating hybrid drives (for the short term) and completely solid state drives (for the long term).Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is a well-known hard drive manufacturer that has yet to take a commanding market share in the small but growing solid state market. However, with recent acquisitions, it looks like it is making a stronger push into the market.In 2013, WDC made three major acquisitions. The first acquisition was Velobit-creator of proprietary software that decreases latency and increases efficiency of both the storage media and the processor. This could play a key role in decreasing power usage of solid state media manufactured by WDC.WDC also acquired sTec, one of the first providers of flash memory solutions for enterprises. This company was acquired primarily for its engineering talent (close to 900 engineers) and its patent portfolio consisting of more than 100 flash memory based patents.The most recent of the three acquisitions was Virident Systems, a major producer of flash storage for cloud computing. This acquisition also will provide WDC with a talented team of engineers familiar with PCIe-based flash storage solutions used in extremely low latency applications such as high frequency trading.Western Digital also has solid fundamentals to support its investments in what is a fairly new market. Over the last five years, it has traded PE ratios of between 3.5 and 16.4, with the upper end being slightly higher than the upper end of its closest competitor, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX). Both companies also trade at similar Price/Free Cash Flow ratios (WDC = 11.33, STX = 11.68). The most important difference in the fundamentals of the two companies is in the Price/Book ratio, where WDC has a strong edge. WDC trades at approximately 2.80 times its book value, while STX trades at approximately 7.30 times its book value.Western Digital currently has earnings of $6.68 per share and has had an overall upward trend in both EPS and revenues for the past ten years. WDC management has been paying a dividend since Q3 of 2012, with a most recent yield of 1.5%.According to the latest investor presentation, Western Digital projects that the enterprise market for storage (cloud-based) will overtake the personal market by 2020.This, along with its strategic investments in the solid state market make WDC a good candidate for a long-term position.Technical analysis can be useful for determining a good time to open a position in the short term, but shows mixed signals in this case. There is a very clear upward trend based on the moving averages, however the RSI shows the stock is currently overbought. The MACD is above the signal line and volume seems constant. There was a recent downward spike when Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) stated there would be lower than expected sales for the entire sector, though the price quickly recovered. For long-term investors, a short-term entry point may not make a large difference in expected returns."

In the first three quarters of 2014, SSD revenues grew by 65% over the prior year period to $1.4 billion. The company witnessed weak demand for non-SSD embedded storage products in the first half of the year, but the trend reversed as demand for custom embedded storage picked up in Q3. Despite the increase in demand for custom embedded storage products in Q3, the division as a whole saw revenues decline by over 15% in the first three quarters compared to the year-ago period at just over $1 billion. Growing SSD product sales and the profitability of these storage products helped SanDisk’s stock to rise by nearly 50% since the beginning of the year. Below we take a look at SanDisk’s three largest segments by revenue, our forecasts for these divisions and the trends driving growth.We have a $93 price estimate for SanDisk’s stock, which is slightly lower than the current market price.Solid State Drives And Enterprise StorageSanDisk’s SSD revenues include consolidated revenues generated by SSD sales for both the enterprise and consumer markets. Enterprise SSDs consist of high-end enterprise-class SSDs used mostly in data centers, while client SSDs include embedded/internal SSD storage in tablets, smartphones and computers. According to our estimates, the Solid State Drive segment is SanDisk’s most valuable division, making up over 36% of the company’s net value. This has also been the fastest growing segment within the company, with year-to-date revenues nearly 65% higher than the year-ago period at $1.4 billion. [1] In addition to fueling SanDisk’s top line growth, this division also adds to the company’s overall profitability as SSDs are high-margin products. The industry-wide transition from traditional hard drive storage to solid state drives led to strong demand for SanDisk’s product offerings, especially for enterprise-grade products. As a result, SanDisk’s management mentioned in its Q3 earnings that the company is now in a position to generate $1 billion in revenues from enterprise SSD sales in 2015 – one year ahead of schedule. [2]Furthermore, SanDisk acquired PCIe connected SSD supplier Fusion-io for $1.1 billion in June to bolster its enterprise SSD offerings. Management expects the acquisition to start being accretive to its earnings from mid-2015, which should help SanDisk overtake its nearest rivals in the enterprise SSD market. With PCIe flash storage under its belt, management believes that the company now has the “broadest portfolio of enterprise and consumer flash solutions” in the storage industry. As a result, we forecast SanDisk’s share in the enterprise market to jump from 10.8% in 2014 to over 13% in 2015.Embedded Storage And Key Growth DriversSanDisk is one of the largest global manufacturers of NAND flash products, which are used as embedded storage in smartphones, tablets and other consumer electronic devices. The embedded storage segment makes up approximately 12% of SanDisk’s value, according to our estimates. Embedded storage products (not including embedded solid-state drives) generated more than a quarter of SanDisk’s overall revenues of $6.2 billion in 2013. The contribution of embedded storage has declined to about 20% this year, with year-to-date revenues generated by embedded storage declining by almost 15% y-o-y to just over $1 billion. [1]According to SanDisk’s estimates, its total addressable market (NYSE:TAM) for smartphone, tablet and other portable device storage is expected to grow from over $12 billion in 2013 to nearly $18 billion by 2020. The growth in the number of smartphones and tablets sold worldwide should contribute positively to SanDisk’s embedded storage division as all portable electronic devices use built-in storage in some form. Although the smartphone market is a mature segment in developed countries, the number of smartphones in use is expected to increase from around 2 billion currently to around 6 billion by 2020. [3] Increasing smartphone penetration in regions such as Asia Pacific is likely to boost sales numbers for embedded storage products. However, much of the growth in Asia and other developing economies is expected to come from lower-cost smartphone manufacturers. [4] As a result, this could lead to a reduction in average selling prices per gigabyte for storage companies despite improving sales numbers.On the other hand, high-end smartphones and tablets sold by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) (also one of SanDisk’s largest OEM customers) should help boost sales owing to its product refresh in late 2014. The smartphone giant launched the new iPhone and iPad in Q4, and announced the new Apple Watch, which all use the latest storage options. The introduction of these products is expected to bring in significant revenues for storage manufacturers. As a result, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) started producing its 6 gigabyte LPDDR3 mobile DRAM chip on a mass scale and competing chip manufacturers SK Hynix and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) invested in increasing their manufacturing capacities to address the expected surge in demand. The added competition and increased demand for embedded storage is likely to help reduce average selling prices and compress margins for manufacturers. Despite an expected decline in average selling prices for NAND flash per gigabyte in the coming years, the company expects its total addressable market to grow at a CAGR of nearly 10% in the next few years. We forecast SanDisk’s share in this market to be 12-13% through the end of our forecast period. Consequently, we expect embedded storage to generate over $2 billion in revenues for SanDisk by the end of the decade.Removable StorageSanDisk is most widely known for its removable storage products, which include USB flash drives, SD and micro SD external storage cards for smartphones and tablets in addition to removable storage cards for cameras and other imaging devices. According to our estimates, the removable storage division is SanDisk’s second most valuable segment, contributing about 18% of its total value. This division witnessed sustained demand for storage products during the year, with revenues flat over the prior year 9-month period at just over $1.9 billion. Despite flat revenues over 2013 levels, the contribution of removable storage to net revenues declined from 43% of overall revenues last year to about 39% this year. [1] The company announced the launch of its wireless storage drives – the Connect Wireless Media Drive and Connect Wireless Flash Drive – in December last year and introduced its 128GB Ultra MicroSDXC memory card in March. The 128 GB micro SD card was SanDisk’s first capacity upgrade in a microSD card in over three years. Scaling up the capacity of the existing microSD cards from 64GB to 128GB was a difficult task, as the small dimensions of a standard card offered hardly any scope for expansion. This was evidenced by the fact that it took almost three years to come up with a technology to double the existing capacity; capacity per card has now increased a thousand-fold from 128 megabytes (NASDAQ:MB) cards in 2004 to 128 GB now. Furthermore, the company introduced iXpand flash drives in November as a storage option for Apple iPhones and iPads using the lightning connector. Although the introduction of new products and the upgraded product range should help SanDisk post strong sales numbers, we currently forecast the removable storage division to generate revenues of over $2.5 billion in 2015 – nearly flat over this year – due to an expected decline in average selling prices.Disclosure: None."

        The market is implying 4.59% in annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, which is significantly less than the growth the company has seen in recent years.","Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) has consistently beat analyst estimates for earnings lately, which makes many investors intrigued. However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that investors must take emotion out of the equation, as the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how Western Digital Corporation fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.WDC data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 5/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 5/5Key Data:Balance Sheet - September 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryWDC Dividend data by YChartsWestern Digital does fairly well in the ModernGraham model, and is suitable for Enterprising Investors. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the short dividend history and the high PB ratio, while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns. As a result, Enterprising Investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to that valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $3.71 in 2011 to an estimated $6.26 for 2015. This is a strong level of demonstrated growth which is well above the market's implied estimate of 4.59% annual earnings growth over the next 7-10 years. Here, the historical growth in EPSmg over the last five years is around 13.8% per year. The ModernGraham valuation model reduces the historical growth to a more conservative figure, assuming that some slowdown will occur. A significant slowdown would have to occur to justify a price as low as the market is demonstrating. Therefore, the model returns an estimate of intrinsic value well above the current price, indicating the company is significantly undervalued at the present time.Be sure to check out previous ModernGraham valuations of Western Digital Corporation for greater perspective!"
2734695,23479,2014-12-05T13:35:27-05:00,,"Hard drive manufacturers Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) face an uphill battle in attempting to sustain sales of traditional rotating-disk drives in the coming years. Since the introduction of flash-based memory chips, there have been constant talks about how long it will be before hard disk drives eventually become obsolete. NAND-flash based storage, or solid state drives (SSD), have numerous advantages over rotating-disk drives, ranging from the sheer speed of read/write operations, low latency in data access, relatively low power consumption, as well as lighter and more durable drives with a greater resistance to mechanical shock. So why hasn't there been an industry-wide switch to solid state drives already?It all comes down to the price. Traditional storage drives currently cost around 7 to 8 cents per usable gigabyte, whereas even the best-priced SSDs cost over $0.40 per usable gigabyte. However, it is interesting to note that SSD prices have been falling drastically in the last few years as demand has picked up. Prices are likely to continue to drop in the coming years, thereby posing a major threat to hard drive makers such as Seagate and Western Digital. In this article we take a look at the presence of NAND-flash chip makers in the SSD market and how the drop in SSD prices could impact them. How Costly Are SSDs Really?In dollar terms, solid state drives are over 5 times more expensive than hard disk drives (HDD) on average, as mentioned earlier. However, there are two points of note here. First, SSD prices are falling at a significantly higher rate than HDDs. [1] Although this does not imply that SSDs could become cheaper than HDDs anytime soon, it should certainly make purchasing a solid state drive more justifiable. Secondly and more importantly, SSDs aren't all that expensive if the price per gigabyte per second is measured - a metric which could be a more comprehensive point of comparison of cost vs. performance. For calculating this metric, the cost to bandwidth ratio, or the sequential read speed (in gigabytes/second), is used against the price of the drive to arrive at price per GB per second.According to data compiled by Enterprise Storage Forum using mid-2014 prices, the price for SSDs varied from $1,000 to $5,000 per GB per second depending the make and configuration of the drives. This figure was obtained for a number of SSDs from prominent manufacturers such as Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Toshiba, SanDisk (SNDK), Seagate, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Kingston. Comparatively, the price per GB per second for Seagate's enterprise grade hard drives stood at around $1,200 per GB per second. [2] By that metric, SSDs are not as comparatively expensive as they appear on a simple price per GB comparison.How Seagate And Competitors Line Up On SSD SalesSamsung leads the pack of SSD manufacturers with a commanding 28.5% share in the SSD market in 2013, according to a Gartner report. [3] Its share went up from 23.2% in 2012 to generating $3.1 billion in the $11 billion total market in 2013. Samsung has maintained a 28% share in in the first half of 2014 as well, making it the clear leader in the segment. Next in line was Intel with a 13.7% share in 2013. The chip maker has lost share in 2014 thus far, losing out to SanDisk and Toshiba during the year. Intel recently announced an agreement with Micron to produce 3D-NAND chips starting in 2015, which should help it compete better with SanDisk and Toshiba. [4] SanDisk had an 11.7% market share in 2013, up from just 5% in the previous year. SanDisk's volume share has also risen to over 23% of the unit sales in 2014 due to a combination of factors ranging from the Fusion-io acquisition, its agreement with Toshiba to co-manufacture 3D-NAND and OEM agreements with large customers such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to produce flash memory for their products. [5] Other manufacturers such as Toshiba and Micron had mid-single digit market shares in the segment in 2013.Although Seagate offers solid state drives for both enterprise use as well as embedded in personal computers and laptops, and a range of branded solid state drives which it sells via its retail channel, its share in the SSD market is significantly lower than competitors. Both Seagate and Western Digital have often downplayed the importance of pure SSDs in the past and focused on either hybrid drives that use flash-based storage as cache memory riding on top of a HDD or alternates to SSDs such as ethernet-connected drives or helium-filled storage drives. It wasn't until mid-2013 that Seagate announced its 600 series pure solid state drive in the consumer market. [6] Because they entered the arena much later, Western Digital and Seagate are dwarfed by Samsung, Intel and SanDisk (after acquiring Fusion-io) in worldwide SSD sales, as the chart below illustrates (Gartner data). [7]Gartner Data via The RegisterAn interesting point to note here is that all top SSD sellers own (or co-own in the case of SanDisk and Toshiba) NAND flash manufacturing capacities. As a result, when Seagate acquired Samsung's hard drive business back in 2011, there was an agreement between the two that allowed Seagate to source NAND chips from Samsung. Seagate currently has a sourcing agreement with both Samsung and Toshiba for NAND-flash chips. Furthermore, Seagate's $450 million acquisition of LSI's SandForce PCI Express (PCIe) business was an indicator that Seagate was finally getting serious about the pure SSD business.What To Expect From SeagateIn the coming quarter, Seagate expects consolidated revenues to be 5% higher than the prior year quarter at $3.7 billion, with its $374 million Xyratex acquisition expected to contribute nearly $200 million to net revenues during the quarter. Moreover, the LSI-flash acquisition also should start contributing meaningfully to the company's top line. However, it is evident that the SSD market is not even close to the near duopoly enjoyed by Seagate and Western Digital in the hard drive business. With LSI's SandForce business under its belt, Seagate now has the SSD controller technology it previously lacked. Seagate has an early advantage in PCIe storage, which is currently a niche domain. The chart below shows Seagate's presence in the enterprise SSD market. [7]Gartner Data via The RegisterSeagate still has a long way to go in the non-enterprise SSD market segment, particularly for PC and laptops. Additionally, the company continues to push for hybrid drives for PC and notebooks rather than pure SSDs. As a result we forecast Seagate's PC storage drive price per unit to decline at a CAGR of 3% through the end of our forecast period. We also forecast Seagate's laptop storage drive per unit to decline at a similar rate through our forecast period. The growing adoption of SSDs could drive ASP per drive higher and boost revenues. If Seagate's price per hard drive for both laptops and PCs stay at or near current levels through the end of the decade, it could imply a 5% upside to our $58 price estimate for Seagate, which is about 10% lower than the current market price. You can modify the interactive charts below to gauge the impact changes in the price per storage unit for Seagate's PC and laptop divisions will have on our price estimate for the company.Disclosure: No positions."
2722185,62493,2014-12-01T15:52:12-05:00,SanDisk and Micron are depending on sub 20nm planar nodes to achieve low NAND costs during 2016-2017.Micron's 16nm tech node promises to help the company generate significantly higher NAND GMs.We assess the likely economic impact of SanDisk's strategy to produce the 15nm planar shrink and delay 3D introduction until 2016.,"Investors in Micron (NASDAQ:MU) have been fixated on the top line over the course of the last year, as we have followed with great interest the industry consolidation that occurred in the DRAM business with Micron's acquisition of Elpida. And quite properly, as the premise of the consolidation was that company revenues and profits would now be more buoyant given the pricing power that would come with that consolidation. That indeed has proven to be the case, and though many are impatient to see revenues rise faster than they have to date, they also are pleased by the margins the company has been able to wring out of its relatively high cost DRAM bits.More problematic for Micron is the NAND business, which constitutes roughly one-third of its bit output. This business has a margin problem, punching far beneath its weight with gross margins in the low to mid- twenty percent range. Analysts and investors have demanded a fix for this business and have been assured by the company that one is on the way. The recent UBS concall offers a good summary of the problem and the fix by Kip Bedard, Micron's VP of Investor Relations, and is well worth your time to review it. The bulk of the plan can be summarized in one acronym - TLC. More TLC (triple level cell) in more devices, offered in more channels of sale. Another important aspect of the solution is development of more and better controllers, a development that will allow Micron to offer a more diverse and differentiated set of products into more market segments. All this is good and will undoubtedly help.There is another component of the fix that is often mentioned and that is more Micron production of its 16nm NAND technology. It is to that aspect of the Micron plan that I now want to turn. Let's hear from Kip at the UBS conference:Numerous other comments by the company on other occasions expand on this statement to make it clear that the company thinks they have the lowest cost memory in production with their 16nm node. Initially sampled in mid 2013 with production shipments beginning late in that same year, Micron has ramped this tech node relatively slowly, with the overall share of Micron NAND bits being shipped today roughly 20% of its total NAND production, according to Bedard in this same UBS call. The implication for costs is clear - as Micron increases its bit share of 16nm production, it will have an increasing cost advantage over other competitors, and this of course will constitute an additional gross margin advantage over time.But will it? Is that assertion true? If so, how big of an advantage will it be? Obviously, Mehrotra of SanDisk doesn't think so, but what's the real story? This article will address that question and its implications for both Micron and SanDisk, Micron's arguably best-in-class competitor in the NAND business. Which company is right? Let's find out. In order to assess this question we are - unfortunately - going to have to dive into the weeds surrounding semiconductor costing. In order to do that we need to step back and take a look at the strategy the various MIPO players have pursued with regard to tech node design and engineering. I'll try to make this as painless as possible so hang on and let's get started.I was once told everything important happens at the edges. Beginnings, endings - these events are important edges, and nothing in the tech world is bigger than the approaching end of Moore's Law. Against this backdrop, the titans of NAND memory have been summoned to the top of the mountain and come back down with three different strategies to deal successfully with this monumental edge event.Upon one thing these ferocious competitors all agree: 3D and something other than floating gate is the future of NAND. With the latest planar shrinks leaving less than 20 electrons with which to manipulate state information, we're not at the absolute end of shrinking circuitry but we can sure see it from here. So we're going vertical and that decision allows the designers to back off to much less demanding lithography and still increase the total die bits by layering multiple iterations of their design.So everybody has pretty much agreed on the macro solution. The big question though, is, how exactly, and when? However and whenever they do it, all the MIPO companies are agreed on one thing: the slog to 3D nirvana is going to be expensive, long and risky. Leaving aside design for now, the question of when looms large over the strategic landscape. This being the case, the question of how much gas is left in the planar tank is very important. Like NASCAR teams assessing their last fuel stop strategy, this question of when is potentially a game changer. Get it right and your chances of taking the race are extremely good - get it wrong and you're toast. (Well, maybe just badly burned - our comfortable oligopolistic control of capacity limits somewhat the ferocity of the downside consequences.)All of our MIPO competitors have chosen different strategies. Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) pitted first, disdaining a shrink beyond their 22nm planar workhorse node and is now introducing their second-generation ""V-NAND"" product. Micron pitted next after introducing the 16nm planar product that will eventually be replaced by their 3D product. SK Hynix went third, but has announced a 16nm process that is slowly coming into production. The Hynix story is complicated by the fact that they are being sued by Toshiba for allegedly stealing Toshiba/SanDisk's advanced NAND technology. Finally, Toshiba/SanDisk will pit last, staying on the track to produce the smallest planar shrink in production today - their 15nm node that is just now going into production.No question about it, SanDisk has made a big bet on planar, and they are counting on the 15nm node to give them cost primacy over the course of at least the next two years - time enough to take the checkered flag on the planar race before the next race - the 3D sweepstakes. Micron is making a smaller but no less consequential bet on planar with their 16nm node - they have started on their 3D ramp earlier but they too are clear regarding the cost, time, and difficulty of the 3D migration. We'll look at their 3D choices in the next article, but for now let's take a hard look at who's right about advanced planar node costing.To better understand the cost consequences of the two companies' decisions, let's consider the production economics of planar NAND. Bits come on dinner-plate sized wafers whose standard width is 300mm, which means it has an area of a little more than 70,000 mm2 (70,686 mm2, to be exact). This wafer is then subdivided into die, which are the ""chips"" that comprise the memory product. These die come in standard bit capacities. In the current planar process node generation, the capacity is 128GB (MLC). Depending on the size of the die, the wafer contains more or less of these die. Once we know the number of die, we can multiply that number by the capacity of that die and then we will know how many bits have been produced on that wafer. Big fabs these days can produce as many as 100k wafers per month (NYSE:WPM), but however many WPM the fab produces, the real challenge of the technology is to produce these bit containing wafers as efficiently as possible, which means that the more bits that can be stuffed on a wafer, the better. This concept is called bit density. If a producer is to have a cost advantage, it helps greatly to have a bit density advantage with its dominant process node, in this case the 16nm node that Bedard references in his comments.Even with a bit density advantage, however, there are many potential slips between the lip and the cup. The manufacturing process that produces these bits is hideously complex, containing many process steps, all of which must be executed flawlessly, and all of which are subject to defects that can ruin the final product. That being the case, it doesn't matter how good your bit density is if the die on the wafer are defective. Die that are defective can't be repaired, thus the concept of ""yield,"" which is the ratio of good die to the total on the wafer. Yields early in the process node implementation can be bad so over time the key is to improve the yield to maximize the output of the fab. This leads us to the concept of the ""learning curve,"" which is a semiconductor industry invention that posits that yields improve over time in a predictable way with every process node advance. All this is a long way of saying that all things are never equal in the semiconductor memory business. Having a bit density advantage is nice but is not determinative. The real key is how fast the company climbs the learning curve to high yields.In the good old days, it was easier to know the answer to the yield question. Moore's Law dictated a metronomic cadence to the bit density race, with tech node advances doubling bit density every two years and the learning curve being relatively predictable. The IP requirements for starting and running a NAND or a DRAM plant weren't particularly onerous, so many companies could invest and ride the Moore's Law train at approximately the same rate as all the other companies, which meant that the production economics of all the companies was pretty much the same.Those days are gone. In the rarified air of sub 20-nanometer lithography these days tech node advances now require many more process steps. Because of the increased amount of fab tools and machines that must be acquired to execute those process steps, fabs must be commensurately bigger to contain all the equipment needed in order to maintain wafer output. (Indeed, the new 3D process at Micron is expected to reduce total wafer output by up to 40% in the same fab floor space.) All this means that each new generation has a much more complex manufacturing process.This would seem to present a daunting prospect to the MIPO companies but apparently not so much for SanDisk. Let's hear from Dr. Shiva Sivram, the SVP of Technology at SanDisk, regarding their success handling these complexities:-SanDisk 2014 Annual Analysts Meeting Presentation - Slide 93Dr. Sivram doesn't show their projected ""1Z"" node learning curve but when he says that ""1Z"" promises to ramp faster than their enhanced 19nm node ""1Y,"" I think his assertion deserves to be taken at face value. What could this mean for SanDisk's and Micron's bottom line? Let's get granular.Here is a simplified cost model for a fab process.If we know all these numbers we can derive the cost of production, generally expressed as $/Gbit for NAND. The problem, of course, is that SanDisk and Micron jealously guard this data and are loathe placing it in the public domain. Ergo, we need to work from whatever data we can glean and try to infer the rest. Let's compile what we know.Let's take a look at Anandtech's analysis of the leading NAND processes from a die size and bit density perspective.Source - Anandtech.com Aug 22, 2014 - here(Note: The die size estimate for the upcoming Micron 32L 3D product of 130 mm2 is mine and will be used to illustrate a possible cost scenario that fits the available known data in a subsequent article. Micron, to my knowledge, has published no size data on the upcoming 3D product die size.)Clearly, SanDisk's 15nm process node has a significant design advantage over Micron's 16nm process. For the sake of this exercise, I'm going to assume that each company bears the same wafer and direct processing costs, those being $150 per wafer and $200, respectively. You may have a quibble with direct cost assumption but I think it's valid since each company is basically running a similar planar process. If one were a 3D process and the other planar, the assumption wouldn't be valid. I'm also going to assume a testing cost and yield that is similar for each company for the same reason. Another simplifying assumption I'm making is all R&D costs for the processes are expensed so there is no need to layer onto the cost some portion of capitalized R&D.Now let's dive into truly deep and murky water for the big assumption: depreciation expense, which is a function of Cap/Ex. Both SanDisk and Micron follow generally similar policies in this area with FABs being written off over 10 - 30 years, tooling written off over 5 - 7, and software 3 - 5 (Micron 10-K - page 52). To illustrate the consequences of these policies, let's assume a new 100k wpm fab being constructed with a total cost of $5B being allocated 20% ($1B) to the Fab/clean room shell and 80% ($4B) to the tooling required for production. Net result, $900m a year in depreciation expense spread over the prime-time productive phase of the tech node that is lengthening out but probably not more than three years. Ramping up the tech node in a new facility would take at least two years during which we have no production and then there's the learning curve which means that even if we get to say 90% yields we may start in year one with 60% yields (or worse!) and all this doesn't take into account that we didn't build a new fab and we are developing and ramping up another tech node and reusing as much tooling as possible from the last node so we really didn't buy $4B of new tooling… but you get the idea. Good luck to anybody trying to do the cost-accounting forensics on this. All we can do is try as best we can to extrapolate from their published depreciation expense and go from there if we want to at least try to get a notion of the relative cost of their processes.SanDisk reported $419m of depreciation expense through Q3 of this year, an annual run rate of roughly $600m for the year. They have announced that they will be spending approximately 10-15% of their annual revenues on Cap/Ex as a part of their Long-Term Financial Plan announced in this year's Analyst Conference, so I'm going to assume a mid-point of 12.5%, or $875 million spend on depreciation in 2015. They are ramping spending on their 3D ""BiCs"" node so I'm going to prorate the spending 75% to the 1Z node for a total of $656m depreciation load on their 15nm node cost. Their announced capacity is 208k wpm, so this implies 60% of their production in the 1Z node would amount to a production level of 125k wpm. Yields will be assumed to be 95%.Micron reported $2.103B in depreciation expense in 2014, which includes investments in DRAM and NAND. Since DRAM is two-thirds of Micron's total bit production, allocating the proportion of spending to NAND would seem rather straightforward. This assumption would be wrong. Because of the unique production strategy of Micron that relies on a partnership with Inotera for a large proportion of its DRAM production, Micron is not responsible for Cap/Ex in that relationship. This means that NAND investments are actually greater than 33% but we're going to be generous and ignore that fact and assume that NAND production is responsible for only one-third of their announced depreciation, which would be roughly $700m per year. With an announced Cap/Ex spend of $800m in NAND in 2015, we will assume an additional $160m/per month of depreciation for a total run rate in 2015 of $876m. This spending is buying 200k wpm of total NAND production. If 16nm capacity reaches 60% of production in 2015 that amounts to 120k wpm. 95% yields are assumed. Using these admittedly rough-hewn assumptions, here is what we get.Let's pause for a moment here to consider what we are seeing. According to these set of assumptions, SanDisk's decision to forgo a 2015 3D launch will provide the company with a 40+% cost advantage over the Micron 16nm offering. Is it that big right now? Almost surely not, because the SanDisk ""1Y"" A19nm part has a bit density only 6% higher than the competitive Micron 20nm process, not to mention that Micron is finally starting to get a little volume (20%) going in the 16nm process and should be further along the learning curve. Let's put this in perspective. Even with what may be only a slight cost advantage now SanDisk is producing almost twice the gross margin of Micron. What will be the result as we advance through 2015, with SanDisk's cost advantage increasing every day as the company drives toward high yields and the 60% output ratio target?Clearly, if the new advanced planar node from Micron is good news for Micron's abysmal NAND margins, the ""1Z"" node for SanDisk is a New York City ticker tape parade of joy for its already best-in-class gross margins. Admittedly, we've got a boatload of challengeable assumptions in the analysis above. I have seen one other estimate of the probable cost per Gbit (Jim Handy - Objective Analysis, 10/14/2014) of the 16nm node for Micron and that estimate came in at .026, though he clearly had a different set of assumptions in play with a total wafer cost of $1,600. (All you EEs out there please critique these assumptions and help me perfect the model - I'd love to hear your input.)Another thing that gives me a little confidence in the number is a test of the imputed cost against real world SSD pricing. Let's look at one example - in this case a 256GB high performance MLC SSD drive from each supplier. Here's how the numbers come out:(Note: Cntrl includes DRAM and IP @ 15%, Enclosure, Packaging & Logistics @7%)So here's an example of SanDisk offering this new drive through a distribution channel like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), where margin requirements are lower than what an OEM such as Dell or EMC would accept. In this case, SanDisk can make a 65% gross margin and still offer to Amazon an opportunity to sell this high performance 256GB drive for a price under $100 with a 33%-plus margin.Here's the Micron offering if we accept the assumptions above:(Note: Cntrl, Enclosure, Packaging and Logistics costs assumed same as SanDisk)Clearly, even at 50% gross margins, the 16nm tech node is not a viable offering compared to SanDisk's. Today's Crucial.com price on an MX100 256GB drive is $116.99, providing Micron with a 47% gross margin on an imputed cost of $62.09. I have thought for some time that Micron's aggressive MX100 pricing was intended to sacrifice some profit in order to regain some consumer and OEM mind share, and the cost we have derived fits that strategy very well.All things considered, given the published data that we can use to correlate our imputed costing, there are good reasons to believe that this scenario is credible for both companies. And why not? Both are offering low Cap/Ex planar shrinks reusing as much of the previous generation tooling as possible. Neither has involved building out additional Fab space. Basically, SanDisk has leveraged a superior design and higher volume against slightly lower Cap/Ex expense because of their ability to laser-focus on NAND with no DRAM distractions.Can the SanDisk cost advantage really be that great? Clearly, the total NAND cost picture is much more complex than depicted above because of the differing product mixes of the two companies. Both are committed to servicing customers with older generations of chips, so neither will ever be shipping solely one process generation, not to mention the fact that Micron offers NOR. In the previous process generation, the 20nm 128GB MLC die for Micron and the ""A"" 19nm 64GB generation for SanDisk, SanDisk holds only a 6% raw die cost advantage (based on bit density). To add to the difficulties we face, while SanDisk has been very transparent about their process mix trajectory, Micron has been loath to give any indication beyond the broadest generalities.Even so, given these ratios it is clear that SanDisk has a strong cost advantage over Micron in NAND in the two dominant technology nodes that will be in production in 2015 and it is very likely to extend that cost advantage for the 2016 year depending on how fast Micron ramps their 3D process. With the Samsung V-NAND process being as costly as it is rumored to be and their dominant planar node being 22nm, SanDisk also has a strong cost lead over Samsung as well. SK Hynix, just starting their 16nm ramp is also well behind, which leaves Toshiba/SanDisk as the undisputed cost leader in the NAND business, and by a considerable margin.How big is this advantage? SanDisk's (Judy Bruner - CFO) own estimate as of their recent (November 12) concall is that they will be at 60% of their total production in the 15nm process well before the end of 2015, with the balance being the 1Y 19nm. As of the RBC concall on August 11, Micron is currently serving up 20% of their total bits in the 16nm node and has given no guidance that I am aware of for their 2015 target. Given all the variables at play in the calculations, it is difficult to fully assess the overall cost impact in 2015 for the two companies. It all comes down to execution and yields. I personally am inclined to give SanDisk the benefit of the doubt - they will rapidly ramp the 15nm process and that rapid ramp will provide them with a cost advantage in 2015 over the last two quarters. It is in 2016 that the story changes for certain. With both companies presumably at full production of their leading planar nodes (assumed to be 60%), SanDisk's lower-cost 15nm process will provide them with a decisive cost advantage in their planar offerings, possibly as high as 30% overall.Bottom line, the evidence of SanDisk's bit density advantage leads me to conclude that this is no idle boast by Messrs.' Sivram and Mehrotra. SanDisk and their R&D/production partner Toshiba have a cost advantage that is locked in for the 2015 (2nd half) and 2016 calendar years. As we go into 2017, Micron and the other MIPO competitors will have another chance to overturn SanDisk's dominant position but given all that we have been told about the difficulty of rapidly climbing the learning curve in 3D technology it must be considered doubtful that they will be able to accomplish it. I will address the likely impact of Micron's new 3D process in the next article. I was surprised by what I found and I think you will be as well. Bottom line, Micron's 3D product may well be the dominant 3D process node of the future but the future may not get here fast enough to threaten SanDisk's strong cost advantage in NAND until late in 2017.If this scenario is true, should Micron investors be unduly concerned about Micron's second place cost position in NAND? In my opinion: no, not as long as the company executes its TLC and controller development roadmap on schedule. After all, Micron has been lagging in the cost area in DRAM as well, but that has not kept them from generating higher gross margins. SanDisk is getting out of the client SSD drive business as fast as it can, and Samsung's only real advantage over Micron is in the TLC product. Once that gap is closed by mid-2015, Micron should be able to take the relatively profitable (35-45% GM) business from Samsung and that alone could boost Micron's overall NAND margins by 50%. With continuing success in DRAM the overall business should show strong gross margin growth through 2017. So no, no need to cry for your Micron investment. Now in fact is a good time to add to your position.The other real takeaway for me from this analysis is how strong SanDisk is now, and how much stronger they will be over the intermediate term. Their overall cost advantage vis-à-vis the industry is likely to accelerate in 2015 and 2016. That, combined with their continuing strong development of very high margin enterprise offerings through the next three years, means that their current 49-50% GM could well expand beyond the TFM's 50% guidance percent range. More on that in the next article.Long SanDisk and Micron, and adding to the position."

Watch for updates on capacity expansion efforts.This report represents the first issue of the Memory Tracker research series, which will monitor memory prices, guidance from the key players, and other memory developments.In this first edition of the series we are including a correlation analysis to assist new memory investors in determining how MU or SNDK exposure would complement an existing portfolio.","Recent decline in NAND prices not a primary concern for SanDisk's long-term performance.NAND Flash spot prices have fallen for four consecutive weeks, with 64GB prices down 2.2% this week or 6.8% month over month. 32GB prices closed the week down 3.5% or 7.2% month over month. Memory card prices also fell this week with 16GB, 8GB and 4GB cards all down more than 2.5% this week. Overall, we believe that the decrease in NAND flash prices have been largely in-line with market expectations as supply growth continues to expand and production cost per bit falls. In September, Micron disclosed its forecast for NAND price declines to be in the low to mid-single digits this quarter, which is consistent with the recent spot price moves.Source: DRAMexchange, SanDisk's earnings call 10/16/14, and Micron's earnings call 9/25/14.Despite the continued decline in NAND Flash prices we remain bullish on SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) as we believe the company's recent investments will result in an earnings boost this quarter. The fourth quarter will be the first time a full quarter of Fusion-io earnings are included in the company's results which will have a positive impact on the enterprise segment and show SanDisk's expanding product capabilities in enterprise SATA solutions. In 3Q14 SanDisk shipped the first order of its ULLtraDIMM high performance SSD to a leading server OEM and won additional qualifications with Huaweii and Super Micro Computer. The ramp of these orders and conversion of qualifications will be another driver for enterprise SSD. We expect 4Q14 results to show SanDisk has been firing on all cylinders this quarter. Additionally, we expect a favorable update on capacity expansion efforts. Our current price target for SanDisk is $100 based on a 14.3x multiple to our 2015 EPS estimate of $7.00. Please refer to our previous SanDisk article for details of our earnings model and valuation methodology here.DRAM prices down slightly with just a few weeks remaining in Micron's fiscal quarter endSpot DRAM prices were down slightly this week with 4GB 1600 MHz prices down 0.2% and 2GB prices down 0.3%. Overall DRAM pricing has held up well over the past few weeks. However, with Micron's (NASDAQ: MU) fiscal quarter close approaching quickly, the company's bit ASP forecast of low single digit increases may not be reached. We do not anticipate any significant impact of the spot price fluctuations on current quarter earnings as the majority of pricing has been locked-in at long-term contract rates. However, monitoring spot changes does give a view on price trends as spot prices converge to contract prices over time. Our current price target for Micron is $40 based on a 9.5x multiple to our 2015 EPS estimate of $4.22. Please refer to our previous Micron article for details of our earnings model and valuation methodology here.Source: DRAMexchangeLong-term memory supply and demand should remain balancedThe primary memory players have echoed the same overall forecast for the memory market calling for a balanced supply-demand environment through 2015. On the NAND side the market is expecting supply growth of 30% to 40% for 2015 and demand to grow in-line with supply. We believe the key trends to watch with regard to flash demand are the increasing average capacity in smartphones, increasing penetration of SSD flash memory in PCs, and increasing enterprise demand driven by big data analytics requirements in data centers.DRAM supply growth is expected to be a bit more contained than NAND due to capital equipment cost limitation. However, expectations for growth remain in the double-digit range with industry bit growth expectations of approximately 20% in 2015. Similar to NAND, DRAM demand is expected to grow in line with supply. Overall we believe demand elasticity has declined over the past few quarters, which supports a robust growth environment. We expect the decline in the PC market has bottomed. However, we expect growth to continue to be driven by the enterprise server segment with the adoption of DDR4 in 2015, and continued growth in the mobile market. Despite the current favorable trends, a large-scale production expansion project, other than the current projects underway, could quickly derail the balance and result in sharp price declines. For this reason, we will be tracking prices and the strategic moves made by the key players closely.Source: Micron's F4Q14 earnings call 9/25/14, SanDisk's 3Q14 earnings call 10/16/14, SK Hynix' 3Q14 earnings call 10/23/14, Samsung Electronics' 3Q14 earnings call 10/30/14.Upcoming memory catalystsMost of the memory players reported results in late October, so the primary catalyst for the memory market over the next few weeks will likely be Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) Investor Forum on Monday. We expect Samsung will give an update on capacity expansion projects which could result in volatility for Micron and SanDisk's shares. One important point to note is that Micron is now trading at the high-end of its six-month average forward PE ratio range at 9x the consensus 2015 EPS estimate of $2.69. We have seen in the past that Micron's price is susceptible to sharp price declines at this valuation level when negative news is released. Investors concerned with short-term price fluctuations should consider purchasing put options to hedge their exposure to Micron for Samsung's meeting on Monday. With volatility off its recent highs put options for Micron are reasonably priced for an inexpensive one-day insurance policy against a significant announcement from Samsung.Correlation analysis: Should you add memory to your portfolio?To determine which assets have the lowest correlation with memory we regressed the weekly returns for Micron and SanDisk shares against the returns for Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) which track various sectors and asset classes. The tables below show the resulting correlations. For this analysis 10 years of observations were used where available. For funds without 10 years of observations, weekly returns since the fund's inception were used. All regressions in the table are statistically significant at the 99% confidence interval using t-stats and p-values to test the null hypothesis that a statistical relation does not exist. The null hypothesis was rejected for each, meaning the relationship between the variables is in fact statistically different from zero, which allows us to use the resulting correlation to determine which asset combinations provide the best opportunity to minimize unsystematic risk. The only exceptions were the mortgage backed security fund and Micron shares which has a statistically significant relationship at the 95% confidence interval, and the gold ETF which does not have a statistically significant relationship with either stock (abbreviated in the chart as NSS or Not Statistically Significant).The results show that Micron has a strong correlation to the technology sector, as we would expect, with 38% of the variation in weekly returns explained by changes in the XLK ETF. Micron has a lower correlation to utilities, healthcare and energy. Therefore, investors with higher allocations to these sectors would benefit most from the addition of Micron to their portfolio.In terms of asset classes Micron has a relatively low correlation to fixed income, particularly Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS), commodities and emerging market equity.SanDisk's correlations are similar to Micron's with a strong correlation to the technology and consumer discretionary sectors. Investors with heavy exposure to these sectors would not benefit as much from the addition of SanDisk shares; however, the low correlation with utilities, healthcare, commodities, fixed income, and emerging markets make SanDisk shares a strong complement to these assets.The bottom lineWe believe the favorable long-term trends in the memory market and low correlations with other asset classes make memory investments an important part of a well-balanced portfolio. Overall, the recent declines in NAND Flash prices are not a major concern for SanDisk investors. On the DRAM side, we believe Micron is in a favorable position to benefit from a balanced supply-demand environment despite facing short-term headline volatility risk.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

2767155,65113,2014-12-18T17:30:34-05:00,"Using a 20% annual rate of growth in dividends and earnings per share, I forecast a five-year price target of $147 for SanDisk.With SanDisk having increased dividends in 2014 and greatly increasing free cash flow to $1.65B, I believe the company is in a great position to increase dividends.Given SanDisk has beaten earnings estimates for 10 quarters running, coupled with projected increase in sales from NAND and SSD technology sources, I believe this company will grow earnings robustly.","SanDisk (SNDK) has been one of the best performing stocks on the S&P 500 this year, with a one-year return of almost 50%. In particular, SanDisk's innovation in the area of NAND flash memory devices has provided the company with great opportunities in the area of cloud storage, with the company reporting that the CAGR (compound annual growth rate) for this market is expected to come in at approximately 8% annually through to 2016. Additionally, SSD (Solid State Drive) revenue grew by 170% in 2013, which accounted for 19% of the company's revenue in that year. SanDisk has established a track record of strong sales and earnings, and I believe that SanDisk has great long-term prospects. Using the Dividend Discount Model, I forecast a price target of $147 for the company based on a projected 20% growth in both dividends and earnings per share.Context of AssumptionsIn terms of SanDisk's cash position, 2013 arguably marked a turning point for SanDisk's cash position and increased its capacity to return cash to shareholders. For instance, we can see that while free cash flow was on a downward trend to $41.88M in 2012, the company's free cash flow increased to a level of $1.65B in 2013. While financing and investing cash flow have been in the red, net operating cash flow proved strong, increasing by over 250% to $1.86B in 2013.Source: MarketwatchIn terms of industry demand for NAND flash memory technology, SanDisk grew its revenue in this area by 22% in contrast to the industry growth rate of 17%. As previously mentioned, SDD revenue grew by 170% in 2013. Moreover, I expect sales to continue to grow for SDD technology given greater cost efficiency compared to HDD-based systems.Source: SanDisk Credit Suisse Technology Conference 2014In addition, in August of this year the company recently raised its dividend by 33% to $0.30 from a level of $0.225. With the large growth in free cash flow and the introduction of dividends, I am optimistic that SanDisk will continue to grow dividends over the next five-year period. For this reason, I estimate that dividends will continue to grow at 20% annually.In terms of earnings, the company is performing quite well, having beaten analyst expectations for the past 10 quarters running, along with beating earnings for every year since 2009.Source: CNBCFor these reasons, I believe that earnings will continue to grow robustly, and the company appears to be on target to meet, if not exceed the EPS target of $5.82 for 2014. This would represent a 10% growth rate increase. However, it is my view that the company has the potential to increase earnings at a faster pace in future years given forecasted increased growth in NAND Flash Memory and SDD technology. For this reason, I revise this estimate upwards and forecast that EPS will in fact grow at an annual rate of 20% over the next five years. In this regard, my estimate of 20% growth in DPS and EPS is highly contingent on robust growth in the aforementioned product categories.Dividend Discount ModelUsing a 20% growth rate in DPS, a 20% growth rate in EPS and a 7% discount rate (used as a traditionally accepted long-term rate of return on the S&P 500), I forecast that SanDisk has a five-year price target of $147, which represents a 48% upside from the current price of $99.03, or a 9.76% annual rate of return, as illustrated below.Source: Business Insider/Goldman SachsSource: Author's CalculationsCaveatsAs mentioned, the outlook for SanDisk is broadly positive given projected increasing sales for NAND and SDD technologies. However, the dividend discount model reveals that a high growth rate in the 20% range is necessary to yield significant return. For instance, suppose that DPS and EPS growth were to be revised downwards to 10%:Sources: Author's CalculationsWe can see that at a 10% growth rate, there is a negligible upside to $104.83, which represents just over a negligible 1% rate of return per year. While I expect that SanDisk will grow dividends and earnings robustly over the next five years due to projected increasing sales of NAND and SDD technologies, the above analysis demonstrates that growth rates would need to reach within the range of 20% for significant returns to be yielded. Should sales not meet expectations, a modest growth rate will likely not deliver significant returns.ConclusionIn conclusion, the outlook for the semiconductors industry, and the newer forms of technology pioneered by SanDisk, gives me reason to believe that the company has significant upside. Moreover, given that SanDisk's P/E ratio trades at 16.4x, a discount to the 21.2x ratio of the semiconductor industry overall, I would argue that the stock is undervalued and is a buy at the current price. Nevertheless, there are high expectations on SanDisk to deliver strong sales in the coming years and for this to be translated into solid growth in earnings and dividends. Should this not transpire, there is a risk of little upside for the stock and the aforementioned price target may not be reached."
2650135,24663,2014-11-07T12:04:12-05:00,"WDC has performed better than STX over last 16 months.In the past, STX drives were considered inferior to WDC in performance.Last quarter, STX unveiled data that might make it a better investment of the two stocks.","Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX) are considered by many on Wall Street to be equals. Combined, they control roughly 85% of the hard disk drive (HDD) space. These are storage disks used in PCs, laptops, DVRs, and to back up the cloud. Over the last couple years, Western Digital has emerged as the superior HDD company, but in the third quarter, we learned something new that might very well change the balance of power.Each and every quarter, both Western Digital and Seagate announce two key pieces of data buried within their company slides. The first is the estimated size of the overall HDD market. For the most part, both Western Digital and Seagate's numbers are similar, give or take two million shipments. The second, and more importantly, is each company's respective share of the high-margin HDD market. Check out how these two companies have performed since January 2013:As you can see, Western Digital did well at stealing market share from Seagate over a 16-month span. While there are no specific reasons for Western Digital's recent success, my personal opinion is that Seagate's products became inferior.Earlier this year, a very public Backblaze study found that only 73.5% of Seagate drives were still alive and functional after 36 months. The same study found a 94.8% and 96.9% 36-month survival rate for Western Digital and Hitachi drives. As a result of Western Digital's success, its company's valuation has appreciated at a much faster pace than Seagate Technology, as seen below.STX Market Cap data by YChartsThat said, in the third quarter, investors witnessed something that hasn't been seen in quite some time. Seagate pegged its HDD market share at 40%, and its overall revenue rose 8.3% year-over-year to $3.78 billion. Meanwhile, Western Digital's market share took an enormous step back, with its market share falling to 44% in its last quarter.Albeit there is still a large gap between Western Digital and Seagate's market share, but it is at least encouraging that Seagate showed an ability to steal share from Western Digital. Granted, much of that share gain might have to do with Seagate being the first company to ship an 8 TB drive, which could theoretically store about 1,600 movies, and is likely popular with large data centers. However, the fact that Seagate could create such a drive ahead of Western Digital is in itself a reflection of innovation, yet something else to be encouraged about.With all things considered, it might now be a good time to invest in Seagate Technology. The stock trades at just 11 times forward earnings, slightly cheaper than Western Digital at 11.5, and considering that both companies have near equal distribution channels and manufacturing capabilities, it seems practical that Seagate has more share to gain than Western Digital, looking ahead. Therefore, with Seagate having more drive options and having made good investments in alternative storage devices, its third-quarter market share growth might just be a good indication to buy Seagate over Western Digital."
2602705,74705,2014-10-29T02:46:36-04:00,Expect top-line growth to be driven by enterprise demand in 2015.Margins should benefit from favorable sales shift with Solid State Drive product roll-outs.We see more than 13% upside with downside risk floored by share repurchase program and strong dividend yield.,"After two tough quarters SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) shares are trading 18% below this year's peak price of $107.83. We believe the issues identified this quarter including lower-than-expected revenue and higher operating costs from the Fusion-io solid-state storage products are short-term in nature. We expect demand for NAND Flash to outpace supply growth driven by big data analytics and cloud computing. SanDisk guided 2015 supply expansion to 5% reflects the increased capital intensity of supply expansion faced by the entire memory market.Besides enterprise expansion, there is evidence that we are entering a stage of increased consumer capacity demand. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has raised the maximum embedded storage for the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus to 64 and 128 GB respectively. SanDisk is the low-cost producer in the NAND memory market with the highest gross profit margin; therefore we believe SanDisk is best positioned to benefit from this favorable environment. The fact that SanDisk has not had any significant gross margin expansion since June of 2013 is likely priced into shares at this level (demonstrated in the EPS sensitivity below).SanDisk's profit margins should benefit from the shift in sales mix to more Enterprise Storage with SAS and SATA Solid State Drive products as the company continues to execute on its past acquisitions of Pliant Technology and SMART Storage Systems. Additionally, gross margins will get a boost from favorable USD to JPY exchange rates which have kept wafer costs down.The Consensus View for SanDiskThe consensus estimate for revenue in 2015 predicts a 12.1% growth rate to just over $7.5B. Using the $6.57 consensus EPS, our model estimates an implied consensus gross and operating margin of 48.5% and 27.5% respectively. The average analyst price target for SanDisk is $109 which equates to a forward price earnings ratio of 16.6x the 2015 EPS consensus estimate.Source: Historic data from company filings. Future revenue/EPS based on consensus estimates.The IRG® ViewBased on the factors described above, we believe that an upside case is more likely with a 2015 revenue growth rate of between 12% and 13.5% versus the consensus of 12.1% (Source: Thompson Reuters). We believe the product mix improvements and lower wafer costs will result in a gross margin between 49% and 49.5%. Incorporating these estimates into our earnings model, we expect SanDisk's 2015 EPS to be in the $6.75 to $7.00 range, and shares to reach $100 (up from our previous target of $94) based on the 6-month average price earnings ratio of 14.3x.Source: P/E ratio calculated based on 2015 consensus EPS from Thompson ReutersRisks to our thesisWe believe the primary risks to a long position in SanDisk shares include the following:1. Increase in competitor supply could lead to pricing pressure: We believe the likelihood of meaningful supply additions over the next year is low given the high barriers to entry for new capacity which is driven by the high cost of the equipment required to produce memory chips.2. Capital intensity of capacity expansion could limit SanDisk's future growth: We think there is a moderate probability that increases in capital intensity could impact SanDisk's results through higher fixed costs. However, since the entire industry faces the same risk we expect the impact of higher capital expenditures would be mitigated by an offset in pricing, if in fact the market is supply constrained and demand continues to increase.3. Competitors could introduce 3D NAND solutions ahead of SanDisk: This risk is difficult to quantify since SanDisk and other competitors are working on 3D NAND separately and there has been limited details released on 3D NAND progress. Since the technology is new we have no visibility on which competitor will have the breakthrough first and what the improvements will be from a yield stand point. We must also consider the impact the additional production will have on NAND Flash memory pricing as a whole, which is not possible to determine; However, it is an area that should be considered, and when it becomes apparent that the technology will be successful and can be scaled, we will adjust our earnings model to reflect the impact.Short interest monitorWe monitor short interest as changes in short-interest can be an indication of changes in market outlook for share valuation and short covering can lead to sharp price fluctuations upon the disclosure of new information.

2631285,54082,2014-11-03T11:24:18-05:00,SanDisk reported both its earnings and revenue a little short of analysts estimates.The company has lowered its estimates for the future which is a big reason of concern for investors.The company's superior performance in NAND Flash memory and a portfolio of big clients should help it in delivering in the long run.,"Memory chip maker SanDisk (SNDK) reported its earnings last Thursday, which left investors in two minds. The company generated a profit of $1.09 per share in the third quarter on revenue of $1.75 billion. Analysts had expected SanDisk to generate $1.33 per share on $1.77 billion in revenue.Going forward, the company expects its revenue to be between $1.80 billion and $1.85 billion in the fourth quarter while the analysts' estimate has been $1.88 billion. Lower guidance as compared to analysts' estimates might have been the reason some investors sold their shares in after-hours trading, giving the stock another correction of 7%.Why Profits Reduced?SanDisk 's sales grew 5% q-o-q but its profits shrinked as margins faced pressure. The company's operating expenses grew which affected its earnings. R&D expense grew 21.5% to $223.3 million, selling and marketing expenses rose by 54.2% to $111.4 million and general and administrative costs were up by 22.1% to $60.0 million.Further, the gross margins were down by some 250 basis points as amortization charges were nearly three times compared to last year at over $28 million, pressuring margins to some extent. SanDisk also incurred $25.0 million in restructuring charges and took $83.2 million in impairment and acquisition-related charges, impacting GAAP earnings.The Current StrengthThe current strength of SanDisk's revenue comes from the uptrend in the market demand for NAND flash memory and the trend is expected to continue for the time being. Further, going by what Sanjay Mehrotra, the president and CEO of SanDisk said, ""Demand for NAND flash continues to be strong across mobile, client and enterprise, where SanDisk's innovations are creating significant opportunities.""The uptrend in NAND flash memory has helped SanDisk investors as it helped the company's stock price rise about 28% year to date. However, SanDisk's bottom line is presently being increased by an upsurge but a downturn might affect profitability.Is a cyclical uptrend a reason of caution for investors of SanDisk or does the company have a lot more potential to deliver?Let's Find OutSanDisk provides internal memory for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other smartphone companies, and it is all set to benefit from Apple's decision to enhance the embedded storage in their iPhone to 64GB and 128GB. This should lead other smartphone makers to start increasing their embedded storage capacity, helping the company sell more iNAND-embedded flash units. This should help the company's performance as its embedded memory revenue was down 16% in the quarter.SanDisk also has a robust position in the flash memory market and Apple is using its chips. Further, it even has flash memory patents from which it collects royalties. Although SanDisk has a cyclical business, going forward it can benefit from the transition in the enterprise market from hard-disk drives to faster flash storage. Currently, due to higher costs of flash, several companies are using a combination of hard drives and flash drives to boost memory speeds. However, as this technology gets a little economical and the demand for better speed devices increases, SanDisk should benefit from the rising demand.SanDisk's revenue from its SSD is growing continuously. In third quarter 2013, SSD revenue comprised around 20% of the company's total revenue, which has increased to 27% in the last quarter. Further, According to IHS Technology data, SSD should deliver strong growth going forward and it expects SSD shipments to increase 50% this year and reach the mark of 190 million units in 2017.Smartphone memory is definitely the growth sector, but SanDisk's management believes PC memory can deliver too. As per FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi, the release of Windows 10 can possibly drive PC sales next year. If the prediction is true, then consumer PCs will start adopting more SanDisk SSD memory.What's More?SanDisk's management expects to start the commercial shipment of its new 15-nanometer technology in the current quarter, with a considerable production hitting the market in the first quarter of 2015. SanDisk CEO Mehrotra believes that its 15 nm technology node, powered by X2 and X3 architectures, will be the most economical memory technology in the industry in 2015, which can serve product applications from consumer to enterprise. Expanding in a new low-cost technology helps SanDisk to proffer a number of chips to various customers and to diversify its supply chain.At the end of the quarter, SanDisk had a cash balance around $5.15 billion including short-term investments and marketable securities. The company has debt of $2.05 billion, which makes its net cash position of around $3.1 billion to finance its projects and raise debt from the market. Further, with a forward PE of 14 times and a PEG ratio of 0.85 the company has good potential for growth.Final ThoughtsThe memory business might be facing some cyclical ups and downs, but SanDisk is in good shape to benefit from dual SSD expansion in the commercial and enterprise markets. The company's long-term prospects regarding its flash memory looks promising. Although this development may take some time to deliver the company's current revenue growth shows that it's on the right track."
2575035,25120,2014-10-20T10:53:23-04:00,"SanDisk's third quarter results show continued margin pressure, as growth slows down.The outlook for the current fourth quarter does not bode much better.As such I remain cautious despite a recent correction, strong balance sheet and appealing valuation.","Investors in SanDisk (SNDK) were not pleased at all with the company's third quarter results and soft outlook for the current quarter.The soft outlook triggered another small correction, as shares have given up roughly a quarter of their value since the highs of the past summer. As such I can see the relative appeal, but do think that current levels are no great opportunity yet given the heightened long-term risks to the business model. This is despite the excellent long-term growth and strong cash holdings of the business.Third Quarter HighlightsSanDisk posted third quarter sales of $1.75 billion, a 7.5% increase compared to the year before. Analysts anticipated sales to increase a little further to $1.76 billion.Despite the growth in topline sales, earnings were under pressure. Net earnings were down by 5.1% to $262.7 million as diluted earnings fell by nine cents to $1.09 per share.Based on non-GAAP earnings, earnings came in at $1.45 per share thereby beating consensus estimates by twelve cents.Looking Into The NumbersThe reported sales growth was still healthy, as margins have faced some pressure.Reported gross margins of 46.8% of sales were down by some 250 basis points compared to the year before as amortization charges nearly tripled to a little over $28 million, pressuring margins to some extent.At the same time operating expense growth was strong which of course is a bad thing for earnings. R&D expense growth of 21.5% to $223.3 million has outpaced sales growth to a great extent as other items grew quickly as well. Selling and marketing expenses rose by 54.2% to $111.4 million as general and administrative costs were up by 22.1% to $60.0 million.The company incurred $25.0 million in restructuring charges this quarter while the company took $83.2 million in impairment and acquisition-related charges, impacting GAAP earnings.Disappointing GuidanceFor the current fourth quarter, SanDisk anticipates sales to come in between $1.80 and $1.85 billion which looks rather soft compared to consensus estimates calling for sales of $1.87 billion. At the midpoint of the range, sales growth is anticipated to slow down to 5.6% on an annual basis.Margins for the quarter are seen between 47% and 49%, as analysts anticipated gross margins of 48.6% of sales.Fair Valuation, Strong Balance SheetAt the end of the quarter, SanDisk held an impressive cash balance of some $5.15 billion including short-term investments and marketable securities. Against these cash holdings stood some $2.05 billion in debt, resulting in a net cash position of around $3.1 billion.With nearly 241 million shares outstanding, which currently trade around $83 per share, equity in the business is valued at around $20.0 billion. This values operating assets of the company at some $16.9 billion, after subtracting the net cash holdings.On a trailing basis revenues of the business have now come in at a little more than $6.7 billion, with earnings reported just north of $1.1 billion. This values operating assets around 2.5 times annual sales and 15-16 times annual earnings.Strong GrowthSanDisk has shown real impressive growth over the past decade, with revenues more than tripling from $1.8 billion in 2004 to $6.7 billion on a trailing basis.Profitability of the business has increased significantly as well, although earnings have been very volatile following a huge $2 billion loss in 2008. At the same time the outstanding share base has increased by roughly a quarter over this time period, although the net cash holdings of the period have risen over time.Volatile but growing operational performance is reflected in the share price performance of the company. Shares peaked around $60 in 2006 to fall to levels of just $7 in 2008 amidst the crisis following the multi-billion losses. Since that moment shares have steadily risen, increasing to highs of $109 as recent as July of this year.This year has seen very strong momentum as shares started the year at just around $70 per share. Following the highs of this summer shares have fallen by nearly a quarter to $83 per share, for still healthy gains year to date.Final ThoughtsInvestors in SanDisk were not pleased at all with the performance over the quarter as sales growth is slowing down while costs are increasing rapidly, being an unhealthy development for anticipated earnings growth.Fortunately for shareholders operating margins remain very impressive as the company holds a very comfortable net cash position as well. That being said there are major risks when investing in SanDisk as well including the cyclicality of the business and a huge impact from potential overcapacity in the industry.Perhaps the biggest risk are changes in technology, making the business potentially obsolete in the long run, even as the company continues to foresee great days ahead for NAND technology.Back in June, when the company announced the $1.2 billion acquisition of Fusion-io, I last checked out the prospects for SanDisk with the company making a big shift into enterprise SSDs. At the time I displayed real caution with shares trading at around $100 per share at the time.While the strong growth warrants a premium valuation, the cyclical nature and concerns about the long-term viability of the business poses a risk. As such I'm very hesitant to pay a 15 times earnings multiple for operating assets currently given the risks which outweigh the potential returns in my eyes. A 12 times multiple translates into a $70 entry target, as there are plenty of alternatives around on the stock market showing healthy growth at market equivalent multiples currently."

The company reported $1.45 EPS and revenue of $1.75 billion after hours on Thursday. Analysts were looking for $1.33 EPS and $1.77 billion in revenue.Despite the bottom line beat, SanDisk shares fell about 5% in after hours trading on Thursday. They closed down 5.06% at $80.99 when after hours trading wrapped up Thursday afternoon. That closing price is off the stocks lows, as it was down as low as 7% after hours.On Friday, to end the week, the stock steadied itself and closed at $82.80.Heading into this report, analysts had been bullish on SanDisk:The company posted a higher gross profit of $817 million, as compared to the $802 million it posted last year.SNDK Price data by YChartsOver the last year, SanDisk has seen its shares rocket from below $65 to as high as $107. Since then, the memory maker's stock has fallen off and is back around levels it was at during April of this year. With the broader markets looking a bit skeptical and uneasy, it's not likely they're going to give SanDisk much leeway into the new week.You can read a copy of SanDisk's conference call transcript here.The Peel's Feel:SanDisk pays a small dividend (forward yield 1.40%) would should put it on the radar screen of those looking to move out of small caps and into stocks that offer a dividend. We know that this is the strategy that we're employing currently, and one of the reasons that SanDisk is on our watch list.The other reason SanDisk find itself on our watch list is due to the company's conservative forward valuation, combined with the fact that they are the ""name brand"" leaders in what they do. If you're going out to buy a memory stick or any type of flash memory and want the top notch item, you're buying the SanDisk product.SNDK PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsOur forward P/E calculations for SanDisk put the number between 13-15. The company has a price to sales ratio of 2.86 and a price/book ratio of 2.74. With a book value around $31/share and $2.30 billion cash on hand, this is hardly a company that is over-levered and out of its league. We're going to consider any further dips buying opportunities and we'll continue to watch SanDisk.We've rated SanDisk RIPE (NYSEARCA:HOLD), but we're keeping the company on our watch screen. This dip, if it continues, could present an opportunity to pick up SanDisk on the cheap. Under $75/share and we'll likely be buyers."

        Gross margins declined Y/Y from 49% to 47% due a suspected Apple overhang.
        I rate the stock a hold.","SanDisk (SNDK) reported Q3 earnings after-hours on Thursday and overall, the results were positive. The company recorded revenue of $1.75 billion and net income of $263 million, or $1.09 per share. Revenue was up 7% both Y/Y and sequentially. However, it fell shy of the $1.77 billion analysts were expecting. The market was unimpressed as the stock fell 5% after-hours to $81 per share. Based on Thursday's close, the stock trades at 18x net income through last 12 months ended September 30, 2014.EarningsThe company's gross margin of 47% was below the 49% achieved in the year ago period. Despite the so-called favorable supply/demand dynamics in NAND, SanDisk's gross margins are being compressed. The company has a list of high-valued customers that it sets separate pricing for. Management mentioned that one customer in particular, represents about 20% of revenue. The company did not mention the customer by name, but all signs point to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). In Q2 2014 SanDisk sold Apple NAND flash and SSDs at a lower margin in order to appease the tech giant.Q3 results also included $25 million of restructuring costs which hurt EBITDA. EBITDA margin declined to 31% from 32% in the year earlier period. Net income of $263 million was down 5% annually and 4% sequentially.Impact On Semiconductor CompaniesSome investors in the semiconductor space dismissed Microchip Technology's (NASDAQ:MCHP) recent warning on earnings, and that a correction in the entire semiconductor space was pending. Unlike MicroChip which makes semiconductors for appliances, SanDisk's growth is based on sales for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. That said, the market was looking to SanDisk's results to dispel the rhetoric from MicroChip. It did not. NAND competitor Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) also traded down after-hours on the SanDisk report.ConclusionSanDisk's revenue miss and decline in earnings Y/Y caused a 5% sell-off in the stock after-hours. Price increases from favorable supply/demand dynamics in NAND have not materialized due to a suspected Apple overhang. In fact, the company's gross margins declined Y/Y. I rate the stock a hold."

To remain one step ahead of its competitors SanDisk also introduced the 512GB SanDisk Extreme Pro SDXC UHS-I card, the world's highest capacity full-sized SD memory card. The demand for flash memory storage is likely to increase at a fast pace because 4K ultra HD video resolution requires enormous amounts of memory and SanDisk has prepared itself to take advantage of this situation as more devices capable of recording 4K video become available.SanDisk's earnings growth is impressive and the company is able to boost its profit margins through its solid product portfolio and strong market position. SanDisk has shown decent revenue and earnings growth and for the third quarter the company expects to generate $1.68 billion to $1.73 billion in revenue. In the second quarter of 2014, SanDisk's revenue grew 11% and EPS increased 16% year-over-year. The strong pricing environment in the NAND flash market will support EPS in the coming quarters.Strong Market Position and Growth in NAND FlashThe storage industry is changing rapidly with advancements in semiconductor technology. The traditional hard disks based on magnetic storage are being replaced by solid state drives based on flash memory. There are multiple advantages for flash memory including lower power consumption due to non-moving parts that make flash memory an attractive source for storage. The flash memory market is set to grow at a rapid pace as storage requirements increase. According to a Marketwatch report, the global flash memory market increased from $28.4 billion in 2012 to $30.1 billion in 2013 reflecting a growth rate of around 6%. The market for flash memory is expected to grow at a CAGR of 7.8% over the next five-year period and will be valued at $43.9 billion by the end of 2018.Source: marketwatch.comThe technological advancements in the smartphone and tablet industry coupled with the growing use of cloud computing plays a vital role in the growth of the flash memory market. SanDisk is a pioneer in the flash memory industry and has emerged as one of the top players. In the second quarter of 2014, SanDisk was in third place holding a 19% share of the NAND flash memory market. In each quarter there is a slight variation in ranking between SanDisk and Toshiba for second place.SanDisk is strengthening its position and the company is acquiring more assets each year. A year ago SanDisk acquired Smart Storage Systems, an enterprise grade SATA and SAS SSD storage system developer, in a $307 million deal. This year SanDisk acquired Fusion-io for $1.1 billion and this deal is expected to close in the third quarter of 2014. SanDisk is also pursuing a joint venture with Toshiba to develop 15nm NAND flash process technology. Toshiba is constructing the New Fab 2 to secure space to convert Toshiba and SanDisk's current 2D NAND capacity to 3D NAND - this technology is expected to be ready for production in 2016. Through its well-equipped position SanDisk will continue its double-digit EPS growth.Global market share of NAND flash memory, Source: StatistaEnterprise SSDThe rapid growth and consumption of data in cloud computing data centers requires network architecture that can enable real time analytics and provide low latency. SanDisk serves this market with its enterprise SSDs and enterprise software solution. SanDisk is positioning itself by acquiring more assets to benefit from the expected growth in the enterprise SSD market. The enterprise SSD market is expected to double from $4 billion in 2013 to $8 billion in 2017.SanDisk expects to generate more than $1 billion revenue from this business by the end of fiscal year 2015. Combined client and enterprise SSD sales accounted for 28% of its 2014 first-quarter revenue of $1.51 billion versus 20% in the fourth quarter of 2013.According to EE Times, SanDisk is the fourth biggest player in the enterprise SSD industry and has a 13% market share. Going forward, its market share will further improve as the company is expanding through acquisitions and introducing more innovative SSD solutions. As technology advances, the price per GB is declining and resultantly the enterprise SSD market is gaining traction in cloud storage and data centers. SanDisk's decision to acquire Smart Storage systems was a smart move through which the company expanded its SAS SSD portfolio and also started capturing a share in the SATA SSD market.A few months ago, SanDisk introduced its high-end and enthusiast class SSD Extreme Pro which offers the best SATA 3 performance. To further enhance its product portfolio SanDisk launched ULLtraDIMM, an ultra-low-latency SSD in the enterprise SSD category. Enterprise SSD is a strong growth market and the stable pricing environment creates a vital opportunity for SanDisk to boost its revenue and profit margins.SanDisk also introduced its first TLC memory equipped Ultra ll series SSD to focus on the mainstream consumer market. SanDisk's new products and the advancement of technology including next generation 3D NAND technology will allow the company to show strong earnings growth.Final WordsSource: YchartsSanDisk's forward price to earnings is 15.4 times while the S&P 500 Index's forward price to earnings is 17.5 times. A few days ago analysts at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) upgraded SanDisk's shares and now they have a target price of $115, up from $110. Over one year SanDisk's shares have surged 67.85% and outperformed the S&P 500 Index. SanDisk is attractive at this price because this stock has the potential to provide decent returns in the future. The company also is pursuing a capital return program which involves quarterly dividend payments and additional share repurchase of $2.5 billion. July 2013 SanDisk made its first quarterly dividend payment of $0.225 per share and recently the company increased the quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share reflecting an increase of more than 33%. SanDisk's free cash flows to revenue ratio of 24.80% allows it to increase the quarterly dividend and the number of repurchased shares."
2532075,23471,2014-09-30T14:56:24-04:00,"WDC is suitable for both Defensive Investors and Enterprising Investors following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is fairly valued at the present time.The market is implying 4.67% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years.","In the last year, Western Digital Corporation's (NASDAQ:WDC) price has gone up by over 50%, well above the increase seen in the market as a whole. As a result, many investors may be turned off by the company, assuming that if the price rises by that much so quickly, it is bound to be over-bought. However, the Intelligent Investor does not consider the market's movements when determining whether a company is under- or overvalued, but rather conducts a fundamental analysis to determine the intrinsic value of the company. Only then should the investor look at the market's pricing, and only in order to compare the current price to the intrinsic value. Here is a look at how Western Digital Corporation fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham, and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company or by reviewing 5 More Undervalued Companies for the Defensive Investor. By using the ModernGraham method one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.WDC data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 6/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 5/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - 6/30/2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryWDC Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:Western Digital appears to be a solid opportunity for purchasing a great company at a good price. The Defensive Investor has few concerns, and in fact is only disappointed by the company's short dividend history. The Enterprising Investor is likewise situated, and has no initial concerns. Over the last ten years, the company has seen its EPS grow from an average of $1.72 to an average of $5.75, indicating a high level of long-term growth that pleases the Defensive Investor.Overall, the company is rated as fairly valued by the ModernGraham model, which looks primarily at the company's growth in EPSmg (normalized earnings). EPSmg has gone from $3.75 in 2010 to $5.41 for 2014, leading to an average growth of nearly 8.9% each year. The valuation model utilizes a built-in safety margin by reducing that growth rate to 6.65% in order to forecast growth over the next 7-10 years, and that rate is above the market's current forecast of only 4.67%. Based on the ModernGraham forecast for growth, the model returns an estimate of intrinsic value of $117.92, which falls within a margin of safety relative to the current price of around $96.50. Value investors are therefore encouraged to proceed with further research to determine whether Western Digital is suitable for their own individual portfolios.Be sure to check out previous ModernGraham valuations of Western Digital Corporation for better perspective."

That said, it is great for top line growth to be a part of Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) supply chain. Apple is leaving scorched earth in its wake with its wildly successful iPhone 6 and pending launch of the iPad. However, that relationship can be a double-edge sword as suppliers tend to bend over backwards to appease Apple. In Q2 2014 Susquehanna Capital detailed how SanDisk got bullied by Apple into selling the tech giant NAND flash and SSDs at a lower margin:SanDisk A Harbinger For Semiconductors?Last week Microchip Technology (NASDAQ:MCHP) spooked the market when it warned its quarterly earnings would be disappointing, and a correction for the entire semiconductor market was pending. Some dismissed the warning as issues germane to Microchip which makes chips for appliances and has exposure to China. The sell-off in stocks of companies in the Apple supply chain may have been unwarranted; now all eyes are on SanDisk. If it reports a strong quarter then other semiconductors may trade up. If not, then investors may heed Microchip's warning of a correction for all semiconductor companies.ConclusionI expect SanDisk to report another strong quarter of double-digit revenue growth. Its bottom line growth may be tamped down due to margin compression from trying to appease Apple. I rate the stock a hold."
2556795,25120,2014-10-13T07:51:51-04:00,"Western Digital receives an upgrade from Jefferies citing multiple reasons to be optimistic.I see the value and the strong long-term track record, but have worries about lack of current growth and potential changes in the long-term business model.Consequently I am not joining the bullish thesis, standing on the sidelines for now.","Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) saw its shares fall on Friday despite being upgraded by analysts at Jefferies. The upgrade failed to lift shares as stocks in general and technology stocks in particular sold off following a warning from Microchip (NASDAQ:MCHP).While I can understand the reasons why Jefferies is bullish, I have doubts about the long-term impact of technological changes and have noted the large momentum seen already in recent years. These are reasons for me to remain cautious.Jefferies Is BullishAnalyst James Kisner who has been employed by Jefferies initiated his rating on Western Digital with a buy rating which has been accompanied by a $124 price target, suggesting roughly 35-40% upside from current levels.Within the IT hardware space, the company is favored given its robust storage growth in both public and private clouds. Kisner furthermore likes the past deal activity which has ""seeded"" growth opportunities in flash based storage. The improving fundamentals of the wider PC industry and an ""embedded"" call option on regulatory approval from China for the company to integrate its subsidiary in the country. That potential move could be accretive to 2015's earnings by some 15% according to Kisner.The overall confidence of CIOs in trends like big data and cloud should benefit the business of Western Digital as well as other HDD and SSD vendors like Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX).For this year, earnings for Western Digital are seen at $8.32 per share, anticipated to improve towards $9.00 per share next year.Recent TrendsBack in September, Western Digital presented itself at a press and analyst briefing. The company stresses key trends, which affect the company and environment in which it operates including the shift from traditional data centers to the cloud, disk storage towards flash-based storage and a shift to open API.The increased capturing of data thanks to trends such as connected devices should allow for annualized growth of around 40% between 2013 and 2020, with growth in data anticipated to be tenfold over this time period. The better usage of data is crucial for organizations to reach and cater to customers effectively, thereby boosting both productivity as well as profitability of the business customers. This is as Western Digital anticipates 25 billion connected devices as soon as the year 2015.To make the best of all this data, it is crucial to have great storage in which you can efficiently access the data.Recapping The End Of Last YearBack in July, Western Digital reported its fourth quarter results. The company posted fourth quarter sales of $3.65 billion, which marks a 2.1% decrease compared to the comparable period a year earlier.Reported earnings came in at $317 million versus a $265 million loss reported the year before on the back of a $681 million in arbitration charge. Full year sales for the past year totaled $15.1 billion as net earnings came in a little above $1.6 billion.With some 241 million shares outstanding, which currently trade around $90 per share, equity in the business is valued at $21.7 billion. The company holds some $5.1 billion in cash and equivalents as the debt position of $2.4 billion results in a net cash position of some $2.7 billion. This values operating assets at around $19 billion, or 1.3 times sales and roughly 12 times earnings.Long-Term Growth, Current StagnationWestern Digital has posted impressive growth over the past decade although recent revenue trends have not been so encouraging. Over the past, decade the company has more than four-folded sales from roughly $3.6 billion in 2005 to more than $15 billion on a trailing basis. This translates into annual growth of around 15%, although it should be said that sales fell little over 1% on an annual basis last year.In terms of profits, the improvement in earnings was even more pronounced although it should be said that reported earnings of $1.6 billion over the past year have been aided by an effective tax rate of less than 8%. One thing to mention, investors have seen some 10% dilution of the outstanding share base over this decade, limiting growth on a per share basis somewhat compared to headline numbers. In contrast to the dilution, the company has slowly built up a comfortable net cash position of some $2.7 billion, a sizable amount by all accounts.Final ThoughtsThe excellent long-term growth trajectory of Western Digital has mostly been priced into the shares since the start of 2013, even as growth was slowing down and even turned negative.From 2005 to 2012, shares traded in a wide and volatile $10-$40 trading range. Since the start of 2013, when the company started to pay out dividends, shares have risen some 150% to highs of little over a $100 per share this year, after which shares have corrected to current levels around $90 per share.As such, we are left in a difficult scenario. Looking at the simple metrics, we have a very attractive investment, which yields 1.8%, trades at just 12 times earnings and holds nearly $3 billion net in cash. On the other hand, growth has turned negative, despite the huge growth prospects amidst concerns about average selling prices and changes in technology, despite the excellent growth track record as discussed above.Yet the real risk in my eyes results from the momentum witnessed over the past two or three years, which has far outpaced real operational growth, thereby resulting in higher valuation multiples. This does leave real downside potential if multiples revert or contract on the back of disappointing growth.Back in December of last year, when shares traded around the $75-$80 mark, I last checked out the prospects for the company. I ended up concluding to be cautious given the momentum witnessed in the preceding period in combination with the cyclicality of the industry. This was despite the positive trends, which at the time were already apparent.I reiterate that cautious stance today. While the valuation is apparent, long-term changing business circumstances could make it a risky investment after all."

Embedded storage products (not including embedded solid-state drives) generated more than a quarter of SanDisk’s overall revenues of $6.2 billion in 2013. According to SanDisk’s estimates, its total addressable market (TAM) for smartphone, tablet and other portable device storage is expected to grow from over $12 billion in 2013 to nearly $18 billion by 2020. Below we take a look at the products included in this division and key trends affecting growth.Embedded Storage Products and Key Growth DriversNAND products are rewritable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content even when the power is turned off. NAND is ideal for mass-storage devices due to its fast erase and write times, high storage density and a relatively low cost per gigabyte compared to other solid-state memory. SanDisk’s flash memory cards segment, which primarily sells flash storage for smartphones and feature phones, makes up approximately 17% of its value, according to our estimates.The growth in the number of smartphones and tablets sold worldwide should contribute positively to SanDisk’s embedded storage division as all portable electronic devices use in-built storage in some form. Although the smartphone market is a mature segment in developed countries, the number of smartphones in use is expected to increase from around 2 billion currently to around 6 billion by 2020. Increasing smartphone penetration in regions such as Asia Pacific is likely to boost sales numbers for embedded storage products. However, much of the growth in Asia and other developing economies is expected to come from lower-cost smartphone manufacturers. As a result, this could lead to a reduction in average selling prices per gigabyte for storage companies despite improving sales numbers.On the other end of the spectrum, high-end smartphones and tablets that use the latest technology are expected to bring in significant revenues for storage manufacturers. According to a recent estimate by Computer World, smartphone giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is likely to significantly increase its worldwide consumption of mobile DRAM. Apple is currently the world’s largest user of mobile DRAM, consuming 16.5% of the industry wide production. This is expected to jump to 25% of the overall production by 2015 as Apple launched the new iPhone in September and is expected to release the new iPad and wearable device Apple Watch in the coming months. As a result Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) has started producing its 6 gigabyte LPDDR3 mobile DRAM chip on a mass scale. Moreover, competing chip manufacturers SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) have invested in increasing their manufacture capacities and are expected to scale up production capacity to address the expected surge in demand by next year.We expect much of SanDisk’s unit sales growth of embedded storage products over the next few years to come from the increasing number of portable electronics devices. Despite an expected decline in average selling prices for NAND flash per gigabyte in the coming years, the company expects its addressable market to grow at a CAGR of nearly 10% in the next few years. We forecast SanDisk’s share in this market to be 12-13% through the end of our forecast period. Consequently, we expect embedded storage to generate over $2 billion in revenues for SanDisk by the end of the decade.Disclosure: No positions"

(SNDK) stock is down 23.9% from its 52-week high of $108.77 of July 17. Thus, in my opinion, it is now an excellent opportunity for long-term investment in SNDK's stock at a cheap price. SanDisk will continue to benefit from favorable market conditions for NAND memory and especially for the SSD drive for the long term. Although supply allocation remains an issue, In my view, it is a much better situation than weak demand. SanDisk has compelling valuation metrics and very strong earnings growth prospects. Its PEG ratio is extremely low at 0.80. Furthermore, SanDisk has shown a significant earnings per share surprise in each one of the last four quarters, and the company demonstrated significant improvement in its profitability.The companySanDisk Corporation is a global leader in flash storage solutions. SanDisk designs, develops, manufactures and markets data storage products that are used in various consumer electronics products. The company was founded in 1988 and is headquartered in Milpitas, California.Valuation MetricsThe table below presents the valuation metrics of SNDK. The data were taken from Yahoo Finance and finviz.com.SanDisk's valuation metrics are very good. The forward P/E is very low at 12.58 and the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is also very low at 7.86. Additionally, the PEG ratio is very low at 0.80. The PEG Ratio - price/earnings to growth ratio is a widely used indicator of a stock's potential value. It is favored by many investors over the P/E ratio because it also accounts for growth. A lower PEG means that the stock is more undervalued.Latest Quarter ResultsOn October 16, SanDisk reported its third quarter 2014 financial results which beat EPS expectations by $0.12 (9.0%) and slightly missed the Street's consensus on revenues.Third quarter revenue of $1.75 billion increased 7 percent on a year-over-year basis and increased 7 percent sequentially. On a non-GAAP basis, third quarter net income was $336 million, or $1.45 per share, compared to net income of $371 million, or $1.59 per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 and net income of $329 million, or $1.41 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2014.In the report, Sanjay Mehrotra, president and chief executive officer of SanDisk, said:Competitors and Group ComparisonA comparison of key fundamental data between SanDisk and its main competitors is shown in the table below.Source: Yahoo Finance, finviz.comSanDisk has the lowest debt to equity ratio among the stocks in the group, and it is the only one that pays some dividend. However, its valuation metrics are not as good as those of MU.Most of SanDisk's Margins and Return on Capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median and the S&P 500 median, as shown in the tables below.Source: Portfolio123Dividend and Share RepurchaseOn July 31, 2013, SanDisk announced that it has expanded its capital return program with the initiation of a quarterly dividend and the authorization of $2.5 billion of additional stock repurchases. The company will complete part of this stock repurchase through a $1.0 billion Accelerated Share Repurchase agreement. SanDisk implemented a dividend on July 31, 2013, and made its first quarterly payment of $0.225 per common share in 3Q13.The forward annual dividend yield is at 1.45% and the payout ratio is only 17.8%.Since the company generates lots of cash, has a low debt and the payout ratio is extremely low, there is an excellent chance that the company will continue to raise its dividend payment.Technical AnalysisThe charts below give some technical analysis information.Chart: finviz.comThe SNDK stock price is 11.35% below its 20-day simple moving average, 13.30% below its 50-day simple moving average and 5.57% below its 200-day simple moving average. That indicates a short-term, mid-term and a long-term downtrend.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.The weekly MACD histogram, a particularly valuable indicator by technicians, is negative at -2.36 and descending, which is a bearish signal (a rising MACD histogram and crossing the zero line from below is considered an extremely bullish signal). The RSI oscillator is at 38.03 which does not indicate overbought or oversold conditions.Analyst OpinionMany analysts are covering SNDK stock, and most of them recommend it. Among the 34 analysts 11 rate it as a Strong Buy, 15 rate it as a Buy, and eight analysts rate it as a Hold.TipRanks is a website that ranks experts (analysts and bloggers) according to their performance. According to TipRanks, among the analysts covering SNDK stock there are 23 analysts who have the four or five star rating, 18 of them recommend the stock, and five analysts have a Hold rating on the stock.Source: TipRanksIs SanDisk's performance improving?In order to give an answer to this question, I decided to compare SanDisk's latest trailing 12 months' values of six relevant parameters to their previous trailing 12 months' values and to the five years' average values. The results are shown in the table below. The data were taken from Portfolio123.All trailing 12 month values of the Margins parameters and the Return on Capital parameters were above the previous 12 month values, and above the five-year average.In my opinion, these results demonstrate significant improvement in the profitability of the company.Major DevelopmentsIn its latest quarter analyst conference call, SanDisk decreased its fourth quarter revenue forecast to slightly below the pre-reporting consensus of $1.88 billion. The company expects revenue for the current quarter to be short due to lower revenue from Fusion-io. SanDisk forecast $1.80 billion to $1.85 billion for Q4, up 5.6% from Q4 2013. While lower than the consensus, it is still about six percent growth year-over-year.On July 23, SanDisk announced that it has completed the previously announced acquisition of Fusion-io, a leading developer of flash-based PCIe hardware and software solutions that enhance application performance in enterprise and hyperscale datacenters. Under the terms of the agreement, SanDisk completed the acquisition for $11.25 per share for the outstanding shares of Fusion-io, and assumed unvested, in-the-money equity awards, for a total aggregate value of approximately $1.1 billion, net of cash assumed.Since FIO's products are complementary to those of SanDisk, I believe that the acquisition will contribute to SanDisk's growth. According to SanDisk, Fusion-io will accelerate SNDK's efforts to enable the flash-transformed data center, helping companies better manage increasingly heavy data workloads at a lower total cost of ownership.Also in the analysts' conference call, Sanjay Mehrotra said:The demand for SanDisk's products has been so high that the company cannot meet every customer request. The company is allocating supply based on considerations such as customer loyalty, order size, margin potential and other issues. In my opinion, although supply allocation remains an issue, it is a much better situation than weak demand.SanDisk will benefit from favorable market conditions for NAND memory for the long term. According to TechNavio's analyst forecast, the Global Mobile NAND Flash Memory market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18.8 percent over the period 2013-2018. One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the high demand for smartphones across the globe. TechNavio is a leading technology research and advisory company. In addition, continued growth in flash demand from cloud-service data farms and ongoing transition away from HDDs and toward SSDs in client PC and server markets will contribute to the growth in the demand for NAND Flash Memory.In my view, demand for NAND Flash Memory will increase even more as a result of Apple's decision to increase the embedded storage in its new iPhone to 64-gigabyte and 128-gigabyte respectively. Eventually, other producers will follow Apple by increasing the storage capacities in their respective smartphones.SanDisk has shown a significant earnings per share surprise in each one of the last four quarters, as shown in the table below.Data: Yahoo Finance - Analyst EstimatesIn my opinion, the fact that the company succeeds to beat analyst expectations quarter after quarter by a considerable margin demonstrates the strength of its business, and there is a good chance that SanDisk will continue to surprise by reporting better than estimated results also in the future.Although SNDK's stock is down 23.9% from its 52-week high of $108.77 of July 17, it is up 17.4% year to date. That compared to a 2.1% gain of the S&P 500 index and 2.0% rise of the Nasdaq Composite Index at the same period. Moreover, since the beginning of 2013, SNDK's stock has recorded an impressive gain of 90.3%, while the S&P 500 index has increased 32.3% and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 41.0%.ConclusionAs a global leader in flash storage solutions, SanDisk will continue to benefit from favorable market conditions for NAND memory for the long term. SanDisk has compelling valuation metrics and very strong earnings growth prospects. Its PEG ratio is extremely low at 0.80. SanDisk has shown a significant earnings per share surprise in each one of the last four quarters, and the company demonstrated significant improvement in its profitability. All these factors bring me to the conclusion that SNDK's stock is an excellent buy right now."

The wireless drive allows eight devices to simultaneously connect to it without the use of network hubs or routers. This feature sets the drive apart from personal cloud drives, and is targeted to accommodate connectivity needs of small teams and even families.Companies such as Kingston (KYST), SanDisk (SNDK) and even Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) have already made their presence felt in the wireless storage market. In its March quarter, the company's results looked dismal, where it reported a 4% year-on-year decline in shipments of branded products. The shipments dropped to 6.27 million units. But by June, owing to an increase in the demand for personal storage units, these shipments recovered and grew by 13% year-on-year to approximately 6 million. The company anticipates that its products' sales will further improve in the quarters to come, especially after it has launched its wireless drive to compete with other competing products in the market.The Financial ResultsWestern Digital Corp. announced its fourth-quarter results for the fiscal year ended June 27, 2014. For the quarter, revenues amounted to $3.7 billion, whereas net income recorded was $317 million (earnings per share of $1.32). The company was able to beat the consensus revenue estimate of $3.57 billion for the quarter. The company has shown some improvement in its results relative to last year. In the year-ago quarter, revenues were recorded as $3.7 billion, whereas the company incurred a net loss of $265 million (earnings per share of $1.12).The fiscal year's results were also announced. The revenues of the company reported a decline from $15.4 billion during fiscal year 2013 to $15.1 billion. However, the company was able to increase net income from $980 million (earnings per share of $3.98) during the last year to $1.6 billion (earnings per share of $6.68) in the current fiscal year.During the results announcement, president and CEO of Western Digital, Steve Milligan said:He also added:When discussing the future prospects of the company, Milligan was reported saying:Analyst ratings of the sharesA number of research firms have been commenting on Western Digital Corp.'s shares and their ratings. Zacks analysts have continued to rate the company's share as ""neutral"", and have set the target price at $107 per share.Analysts of Susquehanna, on the other hand, raised the target price of the shares to $133 per share, whereas their previous target was for $130 per share. They have rated the stock as a ""positive"".Citigroup rated the company's share as a ""buy"", and have also raised the target stock price from the previous forecast of $100 per to $116 per share.Fourteen research analysts for equities have issued ""buy"" ratings for the company's stocks, whereas two have reiterated the rating to ""hold"" the stock. The overall consensus for the stock is a ""buy"", with the average target price of $110.79.ConclusionBased on all the facts and figures stated above, the share seems to be an attractive investment for shareholders at the moment. The company reported some strong earnings for its second quarter and for its fiscal year 2014, with some drastic improvements. The launch of its new Wireless Drive is anticipated to lead to an increase in the revenues of the company in the future quarters, especially if it able to build its position in the market and compete with rival products, as it is differentiated in some aspects and features.The fact that the analysts have also issued a consensus rating of ""buy"" for the company's shares shows that it has strong fundamentals upon which it is building up and trying to expand and grow itself as a strong storage company. This was confirmed during the press release of the earnings call by Steve Milligan, where he states that the company intends on introducing more innovative and leading storage devices and solutions for its investors in the future.Overall, the average target price issued by analysts shows that the stock is a worthwhile investment and prices are expected to increase in the future, given that the company has the potential to grow. Investors should definitely consider buying shares of this company, as better results are expected during the next fiscal year as well."
2464835,60321,2014-09-02T10:17:14-04:00,Micron is a better memory investment over SanDisk because it's better diversified and will continue to steal SSD market share from SanDisk.Micron's position as the 3rd largest NAND provider in the world will continue to support and feed Micron's SSD organic growth and market share gains.Micron continues to focus on shareholder value by reducing dilutive convertible shares by using operating cash flow and by issuing senior notes to refinance the company's debt.,"Original Publication Date: July 31, 2014 by Matt Margolis via PTT Research FORENSICSMicron (NASDAQ:MU) was my most volatile investment for several years. The company was repositioning itself for the long term in a memory industry that was shaking out unsustainable players. Over the past year, however, the company's share price and financial performance have been on autopilot. Shares of Micron have risen from under $15 to almost $35 over the last 12 months. Micron has transformed itself into a sustainably profitable company with an improving cash position. Micron primarily operates in two very mature markets (DRAM and NAND) as well as the very competitive solid-state drive (SSD) market.Micron Continues to Focus on Shareholder ValueDuring the first three quarters of FY 2014, Micron used 83% of its free operating cash flow to eliminate dilutive convertible shares. On July 23rd, it announced a $1.15B offering of 5.5% senior notes due in 2025. The primary use of the debt is to ""extinguish its obligations with respect to its 1.875% convertible senior notes due 2031.""The senior notes constitute a straight debt offering. The proceeds are being used to buy back convertible debt. Convertible debt eventually converts into shares, so the buyback of convertibles reduces shareholder dilution. It also protects Micron's cash. The alternatives were 1) for Micron to continue buying back convertible debt with cash in the open market, which would have become more and more expensive as Micron shares increased in value, and 2) to allow the convertible debt to convert to shares at the end of its term, resulting in dilution of the value of the shares you and I own. Instead Micron chose to issue straight debt and settle a large chunk of convertible debt, buying out the convertibles at today's market price. I personally applaud Micron's decision to eliminate as much convertible debt as possible right away.Shares of Memory Provider SanDisk (SNDK) are Down 14% since July 16thImage SourceMicron's peer SanDisk reported Q2 2014 results on July 16. Its shares have since fallen 14%. Micron also took a small hit because the market interpreted SanDisk's earnings as reflective of weakness in the NAND market. Shares of MU have since rebounded, while shares of SanDisk have stabilized but have failed to recover.Even after its 14% tumble, SanDisk trades at a much higher P/E than Micron - 20X versus 14X. I have watched SNDK and MU trade in sync over the past three months. I believe investors now realize which company has better prospects, and I will tell you why.Update as of August 23rd: Shares of SanDisk are still off 9% since July 16th while Micron is only down 3% from its 52-week high.Image SourceDRAM, NAND and Solid-State DrivesSanDisk's primary sources of revenue are SSDs (40%), removable storage (29%) and embedded flash (NAND) storage. SanDisk held the #3 spot in SSD in 2013, primarily driven by the company's acquisition of Fusion-io.Micron is the #2 supplier of DRAM, following Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and leading Hynix (OTC:HXSCF). These three control 80% of the market.Micron is the #3 supplier of NAND, behind Samsung and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF). Again, the combined market share of the top 3 players is 80%.Micron is the #4 supplier of SSDs, behind Samsung, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and SanDisk. The combined market share of the top 3 players is 54%. Micron's leap from #8 in 2012 to #4 in 2013 was propelled by organic growth (i.e., without the aid of an acquisition such as SanDisk's).The main reason I prefer shares of Micron to SanDisk is that 40% of SanDisk's revenue comes from SSDs. SSD is by far the most competitive memory sector. Micron already controls a top 3 spot in both DRAM and NAND marketplaces, in which the top 3 control 80% of revenue. The top 3 players account for only 54% of the SSD market, however. If you include #4 (Micron) and #5, the top players still control only 66% of the market. This leaves plenty of room for consolidation, possibly at SanDisk's expense. Micron, meanwhile, is taking market share in the SSD space.Better Investment: Micron or SanDisk?Image SourceSSD industry revenue reached $10.9B in 2013. According to the IDC chart below, the growth trend is expected to continue over the next several years. Micron continues to aggressively grow sales by marketing Micron-branded SSDs. Keep in mind that Micron is the world's #3 supplier of NAND, a key component in SSDs. It thus controls a crucial piece of its own supply chain. SanDisk, by contrast, co-owns NAND fabs with Toshiba. Its NAND supply is thus susceptible to compromise. Controlling its own NAND inventory improves Micron's ability to market and sell its SSD products.The SSD market will likely continue to consolidate for the next several years. Eventually it will probably resemble the NAND and DRAM markets, with the top 3 players controlling more than 80%. As the NAND and DRAM markets consolidated, Micron emerged as one of the top 3 players. I believe Micron's strong balance sheet and proven survival skills will win a place on the SSD winner's podium when everything is said and done. I currently maintain a $61 price target for shares of Micron and rate the company a strong buy.Prepare for ""Big Data"" ExplosionData consumption and growth is just beginning to ramp. Sensors made by InvenSense (NYSE:INVN) and others will gather and store information about our habits and environment.

Total SSD revenue in fiscal 2013 stood at $10.99 billion, a 53.1% growth compared to 2012 revenue of $7.2 billion. SanDisk (SNDK) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are leading the way here, doing much better than traditional storage leaders Western Digital and Seagate Technology.Gartner released the figures for leading worldwide SSD vendors in June that showed SanDisk's SSD revenue in 2013 almost quadrupled compared to 2012 sales, to reach $1.17 billion, or 19% of 2013 revenue. The company's overall revenue grew 22% year-over-year to $6.17 billion, a big improvement compared to fiscal 2012 when it declined 11%. SanDisks's gross margin jumped from 33.3% in fiscal 2012 to 46.5% in fiscal 2013.In the first half of fiscal 2014, SanDisk's SSD revenue accounted for 29% of its overall revenue, a big improvement from 19% of revenue in fiscal 2013. Although it's not clear what the gross margin of SanDisk's SSD products is, it appears as if strong growth in this sector is what's largely responsible for the company's vastly improved overall gross margin. SanDisk raised its gross margin outlook for fiscal 2014 from 45%-48% to 47%-49%, citing a ''better product mix.''After taking a temporary dip in 2012, SanDisk's revenues and profits have been improving.SanDisk Is the Best Bet to become Top Dog in Enterprise FlashSanDisk looks like the best bet to become the top enterprise flash vendor. The company has a thriving enterprise flash business and bought Fusion-io in May to bolster its PCIe card hardware presence. Additionally, SanDisk partnered with Toshiba in flash foundry. But perhaps the best reason why SanDisk remains the best way to play the SSD sector is because it simply has better vertical integration than other flash vendors. SanDisk bought SMART Storage in June of last year, giving it a strong presence in FlashDIMM. FlashDIMMs put flash closer to the CPU than even PCIe, and sport a lower latency.Flash vertical integration stackSanDisk's much-awaited ULLtraDIMM (flash-on-a-DDR3 DIMM) will be used alongside DRAM DIMMS, and could hit the market in 2015. ULLtraDIMM sports lower latency than PCIe flash. Additionally, SanDisk expects to commence production 3D NAND chips in 2015, and significantly ramp up production in 2016.ULLtraDIMM vs PCIe flash latency.Note: Blue lines represent PCIe flash latencies while Red lines represent ULLtraDIMM latencies.No real competitionSanDisk faces a bit of competition from Intel and Micron in the SSD sector. However, none of these companies, including Intel, looks likely to provide any serious competition for SanDisk in the near future.Intel has a line of SSDs suitable for both notebooks and datacenters. These include products such as Pro 2500. HGST, a Western Digital Company, acts as Intel's OEM for some of its SSD products. Intel also has P3000 PCIe flash cards that utilize NVMe interface with a capacity that goes up to 2TB. But Intel presently looks more interested in flash DIMMs and has not demonstrated serious intent on moving up the flash stack.Intel had a pretty solid year in fiscal 2013 as far as SSD sales go. The chip maker's SSD revenue grew 35% to $1.45 billion, higher than SanDisk's $1.17 billion SSD revenue. Unlike SanDisk, Intel's gross margin, however, contracted by 230 basis points over the period due to the diluting effect of its other poorly performing businesses. Intel has a much larger revenue base than SanDisk ($52.7 billion vs. $6.17 billion 2013 revenue). Intel's SSD revenue would have to make up at least 10% of its overall revenue for the sector to begin having a tangible impact on the company's gross margin. It would take about 5 years for that to become a reality at the current growth rate. This makes it a much less ideal way to play the sector.Micron has a big and impressive SSD presence. The company's SSD strategy might, however, not work very well in the future. Micron's SSD strategy currently seems limited to cramming components and PCIe flash software into finished products. This might not bode well for the company in an industry that seems to be moving rapidly toward vertical integration.Overall, SanDisk remains the best way to play the SSD sector. The company's shares have started recovering from the massive July selloff after the company issued weaker-than-expected revenue guidance. But all indications are that they still have plenty of room to run. The company's fundamentals remain sound, making it a good buy."
2396075,64163,2014-08-07T13:51:27-04:00,"Analysis and valuation of SanDisk results it in being a weak buy.The company has seen consistent increases in revenue and remains at the top of its industry with strong margins.SanDisk is introducing a new 15nm process, the most advanced process in the industry.","SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) belongs to the data storage devices industry, and designs and manufactures NAND-based storage products for enterprises and consumers. Its products range from microSD, embedded storage, to SSD, and most of its revenue is generated from the removable segment, which includes cards, USB flash drives and A/V players. After analyzing the security, SanDisk's score comes out to be 1.94, a weak buy.(Click to enlarge)Qualitative Analysis (1.5)Outlook: Significant themes in technology include the rapid expansion of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, as well as the growth of the Internet of Things industry. These two themes will drive the growth of SanDisk's NAND-based storage products, as NAND flash memory serves as a critical component in their design. In addition, a growing trend in the PC market is the shift towards faster, better-performing SSDs over mechanical disks. If this trend continues to hold true, and technological advances and discoveries allow the price of SSDs to fall, SanDisk should be poised to capture the future growth.There are three major factors to look out for in technology: total addressable market, growth rates, and technological edges. NAND demand is currently outpacing supply as a result of mobile and the IoT, and because of this, analysts expect the total addressable market for NAND to grow at a CAGR of 10% until 2017. Moreover, total hardware spending in the industry has seen a very steady climb over the past four years, which is worth noting. SanDisk is also already an industry leader, as it is a supplier to numerous manufacturers and its client and enterprise SSD products are qualified by well-known OEMs. In April, the company also announced that it is introducing 15nm technology, the most cutting-edge NAND flash process in the entire world. Senior VP Dr. Siva Sivarim states,Porter's Five Forces:Threat of New Entrants - Weak. Manufacturing in technology is incredibly capital intensive, and the need to create fabrication facilities and spend money on R&D in order to remain competitive keeps away new companies from entering.Threat of Substitutes - High. There is already much competition within the industry, and the continued growth of online storage is something to be weary of.Bargaining Power of Suppliers - Weak. As with many other manufacturers, SanDisk has multiple small suppliers, allowing it to keep the bargaining power of any one supplier to a minimum.Bargaining Power of Buyers - Moderate. Similar to the previous point, there are multiple small buyers. However, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) represents over 20% of its customers, allowing it to have huge leverage over the company.Rivalry within the Industry - High. There is constant pressure on manufacturers to come up with cutting-edge products making the industry very volatile and prone to change.MD&A 2013 10-K: In FY 2013, SanDisk saw a 20.9% increase in revenue largely due to the increased sales of its client and enterprise SSD products as well as its embedded memory products for mobile devices. Revenue grew in all geographic regions, but the largest increase came from the Asia-Pacific region, where the company was indirectly aided by mobile networks such as China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) opening up its markets to new phones. Additionally, the company's gross margin increased by 70% due to favorable industry supply/demand and a successful mix of enterprise SSD products and high-performance retail products. In the 10-K, the company stated that its biggest investment was its decision to invest into a vertically integrated business model by purchasing a majority of its supply through Flash Ventures. This business model will help the company to reduce its costs, improve the quality of its products, and assist logistics.Q2 Earnings and Conference Call (July 2014): SanDisk announced an 11% YOY increase in Q2 revenue to $1.63 billion. Net income increased 4.58% YOY to $274 million. The company attributes these successes, again, to the growth of its SSD segments and its retail products. In the 2013 10-K, SanDisk stated that its priority going forward is its SSD line, and the Q2 results show strong signs of that as SSD solutions made up 29% of Q2 revenue compared to only 16% in the previous year. During the quarter, the company introduced five new products, including the industry's first 4TB SSD, a new 1TB SSD with the industry's first 10-year warranty, and an embedded flash memory solution for low and mid-end phones in emerging markets.Ratio AnalysisCompetitor's Ratios (3) - SanDisk does not have any huge divergences compared to its competition, as a majority of its ratios are in line or only slightly better/worse than their respective peer medians. Although the company posts a slightly higher PE ratio compared to its peers, its PB ratio of 2.85 is lower than the peer median of 3.61, showing that it may be trading at a discount. In addition, the company has higher margins compared to its competition, although profitability ratios such as ROA, ROIC and ROE are slightly worse than their medians.Ratios Overtime (2) - The company has an upward trend in almost all of its ratios, and its key ratios and profitability ratios are undoubtedly growing because of the company's performance in its key segments. It is worthwhile to note, however, that compared to previous years, the company has started to increase its use of leverage. Though, this could be due to larger R&D expenses in the industry as well as new acquisitions such as its planned takeover of Fusion-io.Tobin's Q Ratio (4) - According to the Tobin's Q ratio, SanDisk is overvalued at 1.84 because the value of its stock is more expensive than the cost of replacing its assets. The ratio also is above the peer median of 1.67. However, this measure does not hold a huge weight in the valuation due to being a simplistic measure.R&D to Net Sales (1.5) - R&D to Net Sales is a useful measure in the technology industry because it helps investors understand how effectively a company utilizes its R&D expenses in order to generate sales. Compared to the peer median of 19.67, SanDisk has a value of 12.03, which can be interpreted to mean that the company is doing well, as it has seen consistent increases in revenues and sales while maintaining stability in its R&D expenses.PEG Ratio (1) - With a low PEG ratio, investors can capture future earnings growth for a low price. SanDisk's PEG ratio is currently at a very low 0.89 compared to the peer median of 1.66, meaning that it is undervalued in this sense.Put/Call Ratio (1) - With a put/call ratio of 0.19, the number of investors who believe that the price of SanDisk will fall in the future is only a fifth of the number of investors who believe that it will rise. This is an extremely bullish signal for the stock. Despite this, it is interesting to note that short interest has picked up over the past month.Technical AnalysisShort Interest (3) - With short interest at 6.25% of all outstanding shares, this value is relatively low for SanDisk compared to other companies in the technology industry. However, short interest has picked up over the past month and is on a steady upward trend. This could be due to investor sentiment regarding the company's lowered guidance for the upcoming quarters.MACD (4) - MACD is currently well below the signal line, indicating that the stock has experienced strong downward momentum in its price. It should be noted that it has recently leveled out and is looking to trend up, meaning that it should soon see an increase in its positive momentum.Bollinger Bands (1.5) - When short interest hits the lower bound, it is interpreted that a security may be oversold and presents itself to be a good buying opportunity. Using two standard deviations, SanDisk is currently near that point.ValuationDCF (1) - Utilizing DCF analysis on large-cap hardware companies such as SanDisk works effectively because at this point in their development, they seek out quality earnings. The assumption for sales growth is based on the company's guidance taken from its 2013 10-K, and it is moderately high as SanDisk plays a vital role in supplying the needs of the industry for flash memory in mobile devices and the Internet of Things. Also, with SSDs becoming more prevalent solutions for data storage in hardware, the company is expected to capture that growth. In FY 2013, the company's EBIT margin came out to be 27.80%, representing an upward trend over the course of two years. The DCF, however, uses a slightly more conservative measure of 20.00% projected out for each of the future years. Capital expenditures can become difficult to predict in the industry, so the DCF uses a modest 1.00% CapEx/Sales to model the company's history. The base case predicts SanDisk's value per share to be 102.13, a 10.97% premium. The bull case predicts 110.63 (highly undervalued) and the bear case predicts 80.54 (overvalued). Note: The DCF uses at-the-surface data taken from the financial statements in FactSet.CAPM Alpha (4) - Using a three-year data set of weekly returns from 2011 to 2013, the CAPM regression model yielded an intercept of -0.1497, meaning that SanDisk returned 14.97% below expectations each week during that time frame.Fama-French Alpha (2) - Fama-French is more sophisticated than CAPM in the sense that it is a three-factor model. Fama-French regression comes out with an intercept of 0.0559, meaning that SanDisk returned 5.59% above expectations each week. The SMB intercept is -0.6171, indicating that the stock has a fairly strong negative correlation with small-cap securities. The HML intercept also is negative, but comes out to -0.1468. These values may be because SanDisk, as well as many other companies in the technology industry, are showing growth due to new industry trends.Regression - Performing a P/E regression shows that SanDisk is highly undervalued, although the astronomical predicted share price should not be taken to heart. The ROE Decomp also indicates that the stock is undervalued. Performing a P/B regression, however, shows that the stock is currently trading above its fair value. The EV/EBITDA regression shows that the company's predicted ratio is higher than its current value. For the custom factor regression, operating margin was used. In the industry, operating margin is a key measure because high margins show that a company has a technological edge. This is why in technology, there are numerous articles speculating on gross margins and related measures such as Build of Materials breakdowns. Using the custom factor regression, SanDisk is shown to be trading at a discount.ConclusionEspecially with the hit SanDisk took over the past month, the company is a clear buying opportunity for investors looking for exposure to the data storage industry. SanDisk is set to capitalize on ongoing industry trends and the company's valuation indicates that it is undervalued at its current price point.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

In fact, its relative strength index (RSI) technical indicator is indicating overbought conditions. Since the beginning of 2013, WDC's stock has gained an astounding 137%. Nevertheless, in my opinion, WDC's stock still has plenty of room to move up. I believe that Western Digital will continue to benefit from a robust demand in gaming and an increase demand for PCs. In fact, the company anticipates better demand in the second half of calendar 2014. Western Digital has very good valuation metrics and solid earnings growth prospects; its Enterprise Value-to-EBITDA ratio is very low at 6.57. In addition, Western Digital is generating strong free cash flows and returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback and increasing dividend payments.The CompanyWestern Digital Corp. engages in the design, development, manufacture and sale of memory devices, most notably hard disk drives, for the PC, server, and consumer device markets. The company was founded in 1970 and is headquartered in Irvine, California.Valuation MetricsThe table below presents the valuation metrics of WDC, the data were taken from Yahoo Finance and finviz.com.Western Digital's valuation metrics are very good; the trailing P/E is at 15.10, the forward P/E is very low at 11.39, and the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is also very low at 6.57.According to James P. O'Shaughnessy, the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is the best-performing single value factor. In his impressive book ""What Works on Wall Street"", Mr. O'Shaughnessy demonstrates that 46 years back-testing, from 1963 to 2009, have shown that companies with the lowest EV/ EBITDA ratio have given the best return. Mr. O'Shaughnessy explains that EV/ EBITDA is a better way to assess value-that is, how cheap or expensive it is-than looking at the P/E ratio alone. The EV/ EBITDA is neutral to a company's capital structure and capital expenditures. Stocks that have very high debt levels often have low P/E ratios, but this does not necessarily mean that they are cheap in relation to other securities.Latest Quarter ResultsOn July 30, Western Digital reported its fourth-quarter and fiscal year 2014 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.11 (6.30%), and beat Street's estimates on revenues.For the fourth quarter, the company reported revenue of $3.7 billion and net income of $317 million, or $1.32 per share. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $445 million or $1.85 per share. In the year-ago quarter, the company reported revenue of $3.7 billion, a net loss of $265 million, or $1.12 per share. Non-GAAP net income in the year-ago quarter was $477 million, or $1.96 per share.In the report, Steve Milligan, president and chief executive officer said:Dividend and Share RepurchaseWestern Digital has been paying uninterrupted dividends since 2012. The forward annual dividend yield is at 1.59%, and the payout ratio is only 16%.WDC Dividend data by YChartsSince the company generates lots of cash (ttm price-to-free-cash-flow is only 12.29), and the payout ratio is very low, there is a good chance that the company will continue to raise its dividend payment.The company generated $713 million in cash from operations during the June quarter, ending with total cash and cash equivalents of $4.8 billion. During the June quarter, the company utilized $272 million to repurchase 3.2 million shares of common stock. The company generated $2.8 billion in cash from operations during the fiscal year and it utilized $1.1 billion for dividends and share repurchases.Competitors and Group ComparisonA comparison of key fundamental data between Western Digital and its main competitors is shown in the table below.Western Digital has the lowest EV/EBITDA ratio among the stocks in the group, and the second highest dividend yield. However, its PEG ratio is higher than that of STX and EMC.Western Digital's Efficiency and Return on Capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median and the S&P 500 median, as shown in the table below.Source: Portfolio123RankingAccording to Portfolio123's ""Momentum Value"" powerful ranking system, WDC's stock is ranked third among all S&P 500 tech stocks, only Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) are ranked higher (see my article about STX). The ""Momentum Value"" ranking system is quite complex, and it is taking into account many factors like; average yield, price to book value, trailing P/E, price to sales, return on equity, sales growth and relative strength, as shown in the Portfolio123's chart below.Back-testing over fifteen years has proved that this ranking system is very useful.Technical AnalysisThe charts below give some technical analysis information.Chart: finviz.comThe WDC stock price is 0.19% above its 20-day simple moving average, 4.32% above its 50-day simple moving average, and 16.21% above its 200-day simple moving average. That indicate a strong uptrend.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.The weekly MACD histogram, a particularly valuable indicator by technicians, is at 0.46 and descending, which is a bearish signal (a rising MACD histogram that is crossing the zero line from below is considered an extremely bullish signal). The RSI oscillator is at 71.14, which indicate overbought conditions.Analyst OpinionMany analysts are covering the stock, and most of them recommend it. Among the twenty-six analysts, seven rate it as a Strong Buy, thirteen rate it as a Buy, five rate it as a Hold, and one analyst rates it as an Underperform.TipRanks is a website that ranks experts (analysts and bloggers) according to their performance. According to TipRanks, among the analysts covering WDC stock there are ten analysts who have the four or five star rating, nine of them recommend the stock, and one top analyst rates it as a Hold.On July 31, RBC Capital Markets analyst Amit Daryanani maintained his outperform rating on Western Digital stock and raised his price target to 105 from 100. According to Mr. Daryanani, Western Digital is expected to see a rebound in enterprise sales and continued improvement in the PC market and synergies as past acquisitions are integrated into the business.Source: TipRanksMajor DevelopmentsAccording to Western Digital, it has seen continued robust demand in gaming and stronger-than-expected demand in notebook PCs. CEO Steve Milligan stated that WDC anticipates better demand in the second half of calendar 2014. The better outlook reflects the improving outlook in PCs as well as anticipated growth in the capacity enterprise space. According to the company, based on its unit shipments, WDC's fiscal 4Q14 hard disk drive (HDD) market share was 45.7%, compared with 45.1% a year earlier and 44.1% in fiscal 3Q14.Source: Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2014 Quarterly Fact SheetIn my opinion, Western Digital will benefit from an increase demand for PCs, that trend was also affirmed by industry research firm Gartner. In a press release from July 09, Gartner said that after eight quarters of declining shipments, worldwide PC shipments experienced flat growth in the second quarter of 2014. According to preliminary results by Gartner, worldwide PC shipments totaled 75.8 million units in the second quarter of 2014, a 0.1% increase from the second quarter of 2013.Western Digital has been able to show an earnings per share surprise in each one of the last four quarters, as shown in the table below.Data: Yahoo Finance - Analyst EstimatesIn my opinion, the fact that the company succeeds to beat analyst expectations quarter after quarter demonstrates the strength of its business, and there is a good chance that Western Digital will continue to surprise by reporting better than estimate results also in the future.WDC's stock has significantly outperformed the market this year and in 2013. Since the start of the year, WDC's stock has gained 20.2% while the S&P 500 index has risen 6.7%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has increased 7.9%. Moreover, since the beginning of 2013 WDC's stock has recorded an astounding gain of 137.3%, while the S&P 500 index has increased 38.3%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 49.3%. Nevertheless, considering its compelling valuation metrics and solid earnings growth prospects, the stock, in my opinion, is not expensive.ConclusionI believe that Western Digital will continue to benefit from a robust demand in gaming and an increase demand for PCs. In fact, the company anticipates better demand in the second half of calendar 2014.

2395135,20411,2014-08-07T11:29:59-04:00,SNDK has an EPS growth rate over 30%.SNDK has a PE multiple of about 15x.The stock looks inexpensive on that basis.,"A couple weeks ago when SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) began to decline from longer-term resistance, I told investors that were interested in buying the stock to wait until the stock tested longer term support. In addition, I told traders that were interested in making money from the stock that short opportunities existed and they should target longer term support as that is defined in our real time trading report for SNDK as a level to cover those short positions.Anyone who was paying attention to that recommendation now recognizes that SanDisk has tested longer term support and the stock has not only stabilized, but it looks much better than it did a few weeks ago. So long as longer term support remains intact we should expect the stock to trade back towards longer term resistance levels in its established trading channel.On a fundamental basis, SanDisk actually looks relatively cheap, and if the company continues to grow earnings at a rate even close to recent earnings growth rates, investors will begin to consider the stock as a value play because its PE multiple is currently lower than its growth rate.Using a PEG ratio analysis to define valuation, SanDisk currently trades with a PEG ratio of 0.49. That leaves room for multiple expansion, but that would also require some stability from the market itself.Overall, because SanDisk has tested longer term support buy signals have surfaced; fundamentally, the company looks relatively cheap on a valuation basis, but the only thing that makes us money in the stock market is price so there is a condition to this otherwise positive observation.Risk controls must be implemented because the market itself does not look healthy. If SanDisk breaks below longer term support, investors should sell and walk away.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: By Thomas H.

2346765,69175,2014-07-28T06:41:12-04:00,ULLtraDIMM SSDs will strengthen SanDisk's market position in the enterprise segment.ULLtraDIMM drives are currently the fastest enterprise-scale SSDs.Revenue contribution to grow significantly over the coming years.,"SanDisk (NASDAQ: SNDK) has been the longstanding and leading disrupter in the digital storage industry since its inception. The pure-play flash memory manufacturer, earlier this year, made headlines when it unveiled its ULLtraDIMM solid-state drives, or SSDs. And this new product launch, similar to its previous successful ones, appears well positioned to fast track the chipmaker's growth going forward.Dominant technologiesIt's worth noting that a computing processor knows nothing about an SSD interface. It requires a controller that helps both the devices to communicate with each other, so that digital information can be shared in the form of bits.Investors should note that the mass-popular SATA interface doesn't offer the fastest data transfer rates or access latencies. In fact, SATA controllers can create a latency overhead of 1µ second due to their design issues. For this reason, SATA drives aren't generally equipped in high-performance computing machines.The SAS interface, similar to the SATA bus, also uses a serial interface. But where SATA drives have a maximum spin-speed of 7200 rpm, SAS drives offer a much faster spin of about 15,000 rpm. Plus, their controllers can simultaneously access multiple drives, making them much faster than their SATA-based counterparts.The PCIe interface, however, is the fastest amongst its mentioned peers. Using software drivers, a computing processor is directly able to communicate with PCIe-based drives. This lowers the disk latency, but its software drivers consume about 50% of CPU resources. Therefore, none of the mentioned technologies offer seamless data transfer without drawbacks.Rapid flashSanDisk's entry into the field of DIMM-compatible SSDs, with its ULLtraDIMM drives, was one of the most notable developments in the NAND industry this year. These modules are designed to work on idle DRAM slots, which connects the NAND module directly with the CPU without needing any driver support.Consequently, SanDisk's ULLtraDIMM drives sport an industry-wide low write-latency of 5µ seconds. This is about 800 times faster than conventional hard drives, and about 10 times faster than established and enterprise-preferred PCIe-based SSDs - something that proves particularly useful in CPU and disk intensive tasks like high frequency trading, or online transaction processing.RBC estimates that the penetration rate of DIMM-dedicated SSDs will reach 10% during 2015. And SanDisk, currently the only publicly listed mature NAND manufacturer to offer this revolutionary technology, will be one of the few suppliers of this technology - something that will allow it to charge a premium.RBC projects that ULLtraDIMM SSDs will boost SanDisk's 2015 EPS by about $3- which is about 263% higher than its overall fiscal year 2014 EPS.Industry-wide landscapeThis next-gen technology already has a major buyer. IBM (NYSE: IBM), one of the leading high-performance server manufacturers, has signed-up with SanDisk to equip these speedy drives in its X6 servers. This highlights IBM's continued efforts to retain its market share in the high-margin and high-performance server segment.Market realist notes that Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is the largest manufacturer of enterprise-scale SSDs. The company, however, currently has no plans to venture into the DIMM-dedicated SSDs. If the demand for these drives picks up rapidly going forward, Intel might consider entering the segment. By then, however, SanDisk would've established its market position and perhaps even fixed known bugs with these next-gen memory modules.Foolish final thoughtsNeedless to say, if equipment manufacturers follow IBM's footsteps and equip ULLtraDIMM drives in their top-tier servers, SanDisk's market position will further strengthen. This would propel SanDisk's growth going forward, as RBC's earnings projections estimate.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2325285,56962,2014-07-21T03:49:25-04:00,"SanDisk reported an 11% year over year increase in revenues and a 10% increase in net income for the second quarter.
        SanDisk increased the quarterly per share dividend to $0.30 which will be effective in the third quarter.
        Recently SanDisk announced the expiration of the HSR waiting period for the proposed acquisition of Fusion-IO.","SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), the global leader in flash storage solutions, released better than expected earnings results for the second quarter of fiscal year 2014. The lucrative solid state drive ""SSD"" market had robust growth and solid margins helped SanDisk in generate $1.63 billion revenues with 11% year over year and 8% sequential growth. The revenue growth came with record quarterly revenue generation from both enterprise and client SSD. SanDisk has made significant progress in its SSD business and its SSD solutions contributed 29% of the second quarter revenues compared to 16% in the second quarter of 2013. SanDisk's growing focus on high-end SSD helped to offset the volatile prices for memory chips, boosting the company's stellar results, and taking the stock price to its highest level.The favorable pricing movements and the company's cost-cutting efforts helped the margins to expand to 48% in the second quarter from 47% a year earlier. However this margin expansion was not good enough to match the industry's average margins and could hurt future profitability. For the quarter net income increased 10% to $329 million, or $1.41 per share, compared to $299 million, or $1.22 per share in the second quarter of 2013. SanDisk may not be the company for dividend seekers; however, the company somehow started taking care of investors and it has increased its quarterly per share dividend to $0.30 or 33% for the third quarter of fiscal year 2014. Going forward if the company keeps its growth pace then it is valid to expect that SanDisk will also keep increasing its dividend to enhance investors' returns.Source: Earnings ReleaseFocus On Solid State DriveIn the last couple of years SanDisk has repositioned itself as an enterprise storage provider rather than a removable storage manufacturer. The enterprise SSD market is growing rapidly and will continue to grow at a rapid pace at least for the next five years. SanDisk made significant improvements and its SSD revenues in 2013 almost quadrupled compared to 2012's sales reaching $1.17 billion or 19% of 2013 revenues. Overall the SSD market grew 53.1% in 2013 to $10.99 billion. Looking at SanDisk's quarterly results, it is clear that the company's strong SSD sales will continue to have a major impact on the top and bottom-line growth. This is the reason why SanDisk has tried to shift major revenue proportion from SSD solutions in the last few quarters.Source: Company PresentationNew Product LineIn the second quarter, SanDisk introduced innovative products to strengthen its portfolio. To target enterprise SSD, the company introduced Optimus MAX SAS SSD, the industry's first 4-terabyte SAS SSD and Lightning Ultra Gen. II 12Gb/s SAS high-endurance SSD. In client SSD, SanDisk introduced SanDisk Extreme PRO a high-performance client SSD with up to 1-terabyte of capacity. For mobile it introduced iNAND Standard, an embedded flash drive solution for entry-level tablets and smartphones in China and other high-growth markets to benefit from the market's growth potential. Beyond 2015, SanDisk's new ULLtraDIMM SSD enterprise-class, ultra-low latency, memory channel storage solution has the potential to further increase its market share in the high-end enterprise SSD space.Proposed Acquisition of Fusion-io (NYSE:FIO)Recently SanDisk announced the expiration of the HSR waiting period for the proposed acquisition of Fusion-IO and this satisfies one of the conditions to close the tender offer. Back in the mid-June SanDisk announced it would buy Fusion-IO in a cash deal of approximately $1.1 billion. Under the terms of agreement, SanDisk would buy all outstanding shares of Fusion-IO for $11.25 per share which implies a 20% premium to market price.The deal will be finalized during the third quarter of fiscal year 2014. Fusion-IO's revenues in fiscal year 2013 were $432 million reflecting growth of 20% year over year.. Similar growth in the current fiscal year would yield revenues of $518 million thus adding about 28% to SanDisk's 2014 SSD revenue at the company's current SSD revenue growth rate.SanDisk is looking forward to strengthening its SSD business because this acquisition will add over 7000 worldwide customers. Fusion-IO is the dominant vendor in the PCIe SSD market which shipped 531,000 units during 2013. This will further strengthen SanDisk's position in the storage market as PCIe-based SSDs are in high demand among enterprises dealing in online transaction processing and data warehousing. The synergies from this acquisition will help SanDisk to emerge as a major player in the fast growing SSD and flash memory market, thus lending greater stability and growth to its revenue stream.ConclusionThe company's performance has improved drastically in the last few quarters which lifted the share price higher. Moreover SanDisk delivered surprising earnings results in the last four quarters to beat analysts' estimates at an average rate of 18.75%; this is a very impressive performance. The positive earnings revision for the third quarter is well justified and it is highly likely that the company will beat those estimates. Also the company's margin expanded due to a mix of high-margin embedded and client and enterprise class SSD solution and products. Moreover, SanDisk is witnessing an increase in the demand of its SSD products which will boost its top line. The decline in cost per gigabyte and increase in average selling price per gigabyte is also an opportunity for SanDisk.SanDisk is a fairly valued stock and it is trading at a forward price to earnings multiple of 16.1 times in comparison to the S&P 500's PE of 17.4 times. In the next five years, SanDisk's earnings per share are expected to grow by high double-digits of 18.75% which is a very impressive growth rate. Because of the company' new acquisition, continuing growth in the SSD business and new product line, analysts have assigned an average target price of $112.28 which will give rise to an upside potential of 15% to its current price of $97.62.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Gemstone Equity Research research analyst.

2571175,25791,2014-10-17T15:40:50-04:00,,"This report is effective October 16, 2014 and uses the limited information available as of that day to analyze company performance. Please refer to the other reports on CapitalCube for more detailed and up to date company analysis.SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) just reported its preliminary financial results for the quarter ended Sept. 30 based on which we provide a unique corporate earnings release based analysis of its performance. Our analysis focuses on the company's performance for the same quarterly period on a year-on-year basis (unless stated otherwise). This earnings release follows the earnings announcements from the following peers of SanDisk Corporation - Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Highlights: Revenue Growth Versus Earnings Growth: Companies sometimes focus on growing their top-line (sales or revenues) more than their bottom line - i.e. earnings or net income. Investors should look at revenue growth to understand a company's ability to grow its market share, and earnings growth to look at the company's ability to generate returns. Comparing revenue growth to earnings growth helps understand a couple of items: (1) A company's focus on gaining market share vs. generating profits and (2) How additive or dilutive the revenue performance has been to earnings. SNDK-US's year-on-year change in top line compared to the same period last year of 7.47% is better than its change in earnings which was -5.13% - suggesting perhaps that the company's focus is on the top line at the expense of bottom line earnings. But more critically, this top line performance is among the lowest thus far in its sector - inviting the potential of loss in market share as well this period. Also, for comparison purposes, revenues changed by 6.88% and earnings by -4.12% compared to the immediate last quarter.Earnings Growth Trend: The company's year-on-year decline in earnings has been influenced by the following factors: (1) Decline in gross margins from 56.59% to 54.92% and (2) issues with cost controls. As a result, operating margins (EBITDA margins) went from 37.99% to 32.31% in this period. For comparison, gross margins were 55.09% and EBITDA margins 34.20% in the immediate last quarter.Gross Margin Trend: Companies sometimes trade off for improvements in revenues and margins by extending friendlier terms to customers and vendors. One quick way to check against such activity is to compare the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is quite possible that the company's performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply a prop up using the balance sheet. The company's decline in gross margins is offset by some improvements on the balance sheet side - working capital management shows progress. The company's working capital days have gone down to 124.82 from 166.36 for the same period last year and suggests that the gross margin decline is not altogether bad.Operating Cash Flow Growth Versus Earnings Growth: Companies often post earnings numbers that are influenced by non-cash activities. One way to gauge the quality of the declared earnings number is to judge the deviation in the growth in earnings from the growth in operating cash flows. In general, an earnings growth rate that is higher compared to the operating cash flow growth implies a higher proportion of non-operating and even one-time activities - such activities are typically not sustainable over long periods. SNDK-US's year-on-year change in operating cash flow of 53.68% is better than its change in earnings suggesting that the company might have been able to declare a higher earnings number. But, this change in operating cash flow is less than average among the declared results thus far in its peer group.Unusual Items: The company's decline in earnings has been influenced by the following factors: (1) Decline in EBIT margins from 31.32% to 23.63% and (2) unusual items that decreased pretax margins from 24.83% to 21.35%.EPS Growth Compared To Earnings Growth: SNDK-US's year-on-year change in Earnings per Share (EPS) of -7.63% is less than its change in earnings of -5.13%. This lower EPS growth suggests a likely larger dilution in the company's shares this period. However, on the positive side, this change in earnings is better than average among the declared results thus far in its peer group suggesting that the company is gaining more ground in generating profits in this group.Supporting Data: The table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and other relevant metrics:Company Profile: SanDisk Corp. designs, develops, markets and manufactures flash storage card products used in a wide variety of consumer electronics products.

2348885,25047,2014-07-28T14:43:05-04:00,"There are many interesting tech companies which Warren Buffett doesn't touch.I show why one such company, SanDisk, seemingly very profitable and not very expensive, is still avoided by Warren Buffett.The problem has to do both with cyclicality and the risk of obsolescence. I show one example which could put SanDisk at risk in the not so distant future.","SanDisk (NSNDK) is a nice, profitable company. On top of that, with the massive adoption of smartphones and tablets, flash memory has seen tremendous demand. It's thus not much of a surprise that SanDisk stock did magnificently over the last 5 years.So why does Warren Buffett not buy into companies like these where the favorable trends are so obvious and strong? There are two main reasons.First, these companies are usually cyclicalsDemand for memory might be ever-growing except in rare, deep, recessions. But the provisioning of capacity to build this memory is not very granular. The factories are huge and the product is commoditized and sold on specifications.This means that when the product gets very profitable, new capacity usually emerges in large chunks, and the market quickly goes from undersupplied and firm to oversupplied and chaotic.That's not necessarily the case today, though it might be at some point in the future when the smartphone market matures. Still, the very situation is a bit alien to Warren Buffett, and it makes things hard for investors since when these companies are the most profitable and with the lowest valuation multiples is usually when they're the most dangerous.Second, you can be obsolesced quicklyMore importantly for Warren Buffett, he likes to look at his companies and be able to tell that they'll be around decades into the future. Merge this persistence with secular growth and a fair to cheap valuation when you buy, and it's hard to do badly.Such characteristic, however, is not present in tech companies like SanDisk. You cannot be sure that SanDisk will be around 20 years from now. It's easy to show how for instance take this Engadget article, ""Future phones could house a terabyte of storage"":If this RRAM fulfills its promises, the kind of memory SanDisk produces will instantly be obsolesced. Furthermore, in the chaos which would follow, several new memory producers would emerge, and someone else would have the intellectual property to this new RRAM. It is likely that such a technological development would see SanDisk as a victim.So there you have it, even a few years into the future there's massive technological risk for companies like SanDisk. This alone drives away Warren Buffett from them. And it ought to lead sensible investors to require much lower earnings multiples as well, given the risk. Yet, at present SanDisk trades for 13.8 times 2015 earnings estimates.ConclusionWhile many might find SanDisk interesting as an investment, its intrinsic qualities will forever keep investors like Warren Buffett away. Both its cyclicality and technological risks are potentially massive.If I were to be long SanDisk, I'd keep an eye on the RRAM development. It looks like a potential asteroid if it comes to fruition.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2324275,22018,2014-07-19T06:21:59-04:00,"After the retreat in its stock price, it is now an excellent opportunity for a long-term investment in SNDK's stock at a reasonable price.SanDisk will benefit from favorable market conditions for the NAND memories in the long term.SNDK has compelling valuation metrics and very strong earnings growth prospects. SNDK's stock is ranked second among all S&P 500 tech stocks according to Portfolio123's ""Balanced4"" powerful ranking system.","Although SanDisk Corp. (NASDAQ:SNDK) reported on July 16 financial results that topped analysts' expectations, its stock fell 13.56% in the next trading day, mainly due to a moderate third-quarter revenue guidance. In order to support NAND pricing, SanDisk and other major Flash Memory manufacturers have restrained capacity additions. Therefore, SanDisk will probably meet capacity shortages in the next few quarters.In my opinion, after the retreat in its stock price, it is now an excellent opportunity for a long-term investment in SNDK's stock at a reasonable price. SNDK's stock still has plenty of room to move up, because it has compelling valuation metrics and very strong earnings growth prospects, and because of favorable market conditions for the NAND memories and especially for the SSD drive in the long term.The companySanDisk Corporation is a global leader in flash storage solutions. SanDisk designs, develops, manufactures, and markets data storage products that are used in various consumer electronics products. The company was founded in 1988 and is headquartered in Milpitas, California.Valuation MetricsThe table below presents the valuation metrics of SNDK, the data were taken from Yahoo Finance and finviz.com.SanDisk's valuation metrics are very good; the trailing P/E is at 19.64, and the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is very low at 8.68. According to Yahoo Finance, SNDK's next financial year forward P/E is low at 14.36 and the average annual earnings growth estimates for the next 5 years is very high at 18.75%, these give a very low PEG ratio of 0.77. The PEG Ratio - price/earnings to growth ratio is a widely used indicator of a stock's potential value. It is favored by many investors over the P/E ratio because it also accounts for growth. A lower PEG means that the stock is more undervalued.Latest Quarter ResultsOn July 16, SanDisk reported its second-quarter 2014 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.02 (1.40%) and beat on revenues.Second quarter revenue of $1.63 billion increased 11 percent on a year-over-year basis and increased 8 percent sequentially. On a GAAP basis, second quarter net income was $274 million, or $1.14 per share, compared to net income of $262 million, or $1.06 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 and $269 million, or $1.14 per share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. On a non-GAAP basis, second quarter net income was $329 million, or $1.41 per share, compared to net income of $299 million, or $1.22 per share, in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 and net income of $330 million, or $1.44 per share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2014.In the report, Sanjay Mehrotra, president and chief executive officer of SanDisk said:Competitors and Group ComparisonA comparison of key fundamental data between SanDisk and its main competitors is shown in the table below.Source: Yahoo Finance, finviz.comSanDisk has the lowest debt to equity ratio among the stocks in the group, and it is the only one that pay some dividend. However, its valuation metrics are not as good as those of MU.SanDisk's Return on Capital parameters have been much better than its industry median, its sector median and the S&P 500 median, as shown in the table below.Source: Portfolio123Dividend and Share RepurchaseOn July 31, 2013, SanDisk announced that it has expanded its capital return program with the initiation of a quarterly dividend and the authorization of $2.5 billion of additional stock repurchases. The company will complete part of this stock repurchase through a $1.0 billion Accelerated Share Repurchase agreement. SanDisk implemented a dividend on July 31, 2013 and made its first quarterly payment of $0.225 per common share in 3Q13.The forward annual dividend yield is at 0.90% and the payout ratio is only 13.6%.Since the company generates lots of cash, has a low debt and the payout ratio is extremely low, there is an excellent chance that the company will continue to raise its dividend payment.Technical AnalysisThe charts below give some technical analysis information.Chart: finviz.comThe SNDK stock price is 8.91% below its 20-day simple moving average, 4.15% below its 50-day simple moving average and 20.13% above its 200-day simple moving average. That indicates a short-term and a mid-term downtrend, and a long-term uptrend.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.The weekly MACD histogram, a particularly valuable indicator by technicians, is at 0.42 and descending, which is a bearish signal (a rising MACD histogram and crossing the zero line from below is considered an extremely bullish signal). The RSI oscillator is at 58.26 which do not indicate overbought or oversold conditions.RankingAccording to Portfolio123's ""Balanced4"" powerful ranking system SNDK's stock is ranked second among all S&P 500 tech stocks; only Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) has a higher ranking (see my SA article about STX). The ""Balanced4"" ranking system is quite complex, and it is taking into account many factors like; EPS consistency, technical analysis, valuation, profitability ratios and dividend information. Back-testing over fifteen years has proved that this ranking system is very useful.Source: Portfolio123Analyst OpinionMany analysts are covering the SNDK's stock and most of them recommend it. Among the 30 analysts 10 rate it as a Strong Buy, 12 rate it as a Buy, and 8 analysts rate it as a Hold.TipRanks is a website that ranks experts (analysts and bloggers) according to their performance. According to TipRanks, among the analysts covering SNDK stock there are 23 analysts who have the four or five star rating, 17 of them recommend the stock, and six analysts have a Hold rating on the stock.On July 17, Wedbush's analyst Betsy Van Hees maintained an Outperform rating on SanDisk with a $105 price target following SNDK's strong 2Q14 results. I consider Ms. Van Hees' analysis very valuable, since she has 5-Star rating from TipRanks for the accuracy of her previous calls.Source: TipRanksMajor DevelopmentsOn June 16, SanDisk announced a definitive agreement to acquire Fusion-io (NYSE:FIO), a leading developer of flash-based PCIe hardware and software solutions that enhance application performance in enterprise and hyperscale datacenters. The acquisition will be an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $1.1 billion, net of cash assumed.Since FIO's products are complementary to those of SanDisk, I believe that the acquisition will contribute to SanDisk's growth. According to SanDisk, Fusion-io will accelerate SNDK's efforts to enable the flash-transformed data center, helping companies better manage increasingly heavy data workloads at a lower total cost of ownership.SanDisk will benefit from favorable market conditions for the NAND memories for the long term. According to TechNavio's analysts' forecast, the Global Mobile NAND Flash Memory market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 18.8 percent over the period 2013-2018. One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the high demand for smartphones across the globe. TechNavio is a leading technology research and advisory company. In addition, continued growth in flash demand from cloud-service data farms and ongoing transition away from HDDs and toward SSDs in client PC and server markets will contribute to the growth in the demand for NAND Flash Memory.ConclusionAs a global leader in flash storage solutions, SanDisk will benefit from favorable market conditions for the NAND memories in the long term. SanDisk has compelling valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects; it has an extremely low PEG ratio of 0.77. Furthermore, SNDK's stock is ranked second among all S&P 500 tech stocks according to Portfolio123's ""Balanced4"" powerful ranking system. All these factors bring me to the conclusion that SNDK's stock is an excellent Buy right now.Disclosure: The author is long SNDK.

2323255,31441,2014-07-18T13:43:20-04:00,The mobile device market has been a boon to SanDisk and Micron.Having Apple as a major client has been beneficial for top line growth.The drawback is that gross margins may become compressed if Apple decides to flex more of its industry muscle.,"Source: Anchor's Anti-Bullying Message Via Mashable.comEarlier this week SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK) shot the lights out on it Q2 earnings. The company's Q2 revenue of $1.63 billion increased 11 percent on a year-over-year basis and increased 8 percent sequentially. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $329 million, or $1.41 per share, compared to net income of $262 million or $1.06 per share for Q2 2013. Its earnings actually exceeded analysts' expectations of $1.39 per share. However, the company's double digit revenue growth was somewhat muted by its decline in gross margin year-over-year. My previous article described the cause of the decline:I assumed the gross margin decline would eventually correct itself; however, we found out later it was driven by SanDisk's attempt to please Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) - one of its largest clients. According to Susquehanna Capital, SanDisk made a strategic decision to supply Apple with a significant volume of NAND flash and SSDs at a lower margin:With the emergence of mobile products, sales of embedded and removable NAND flash solutions for the mobile market have grown to represent the lion's share of the company's revenue. That said, a ""partnering arrangement"" with a company like Apple who can drive continued growth of mobile devices may be warranted. The following chart displays SanDisk's historical financial performance:Micron TechnologyMicron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a major competitor of SanDisk in NAND flash drives. With its recent acquisition of Elpida, a Japanese corporation, in 2013, Micron also has significant exposure to Apple. According to Russ Fischer, Micron may have acquired Elpida because of Elpida's relationship with Apple in the mobile DRAM segment:Micron's performance pre-Elpida and post-Elpida, is a point of contention. Lack of growth post-acquisition was the reason the stock sold off after Micron's Q3 earnings report:Below are the historical financial results for Micron:Micron In The ""Show Me Phase""Micron is currently at an inflection point when it comes to its expected earnings growth rate and how that translates to an appropriate price-to-earnings ratio. It is too early to tell how the company will perform post-Elpida, and management did not offer guidance on the Q3 earnings call. I raised these issues and more when I attempted to value the company via a ""bottoms-up"" analysis. In my opinion, Micron is in the ""show me"" phase - it does not deserve a high earnings multiple until it delivers double-digit earnings growth. On the article, Pump The Brakes: Micron Is Worth $18-$22 Per Share I was harangued by longs for applying an 8x - 10x multiple to Micron's run-rate earnings:Through mid-day July 18th, the company has a market capitalization of $35.8 billion or 18x last 12 months earnings through May 2014 (""LTM0514). With an enterprise value of $39.9 billion (includes long-term debt of $4.1 billion), the company trades at about 3.7 times LTM0514 revenue and 2.5x run-rate revenue (last two quarters annualized). Over the next week or so I will sharpen my pencil on Micron's valuation and better estimate the value of its net operating losses, come up with appropriate tax rate and settle the price-to-earnings multiple debate. I understand that longs have been waiting with bated breath.Apple ... Friend or Foe?Apple is the 800 pound gorilla of mobile devices and after its announced partnership with International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) to transform enterprise mobility, it may enhance its position. As recently as 2013 Apple was responsible for as much as 13% of Micron's sales. To give you a feel for how much power Apple wields, for May 2014 it was the top smartphone OEM in the U.S. with a 42% market share.Apple did not become one of the largest public-traded companies in the U.S. no reason. Companies get excited when becoming an Apple supplier, but once a supplier gets to a certain size in sales, there is always the risk that Apple will squeeze the supplier's margins. It reminds me of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in that respect.ConclusionApple is both friend and foe to SanDisk and Micron. It will be a boon to their top line growth as the mobile device market continues to grow. However, they may experience compression in gross margin if Apple decides to wield its power as one of their major clients. SanDisk experienced this phenomenon in its most recent earnings report. Whether Micron reports a similar impact on its gross margin when Q4 results are announced remains to be seen.Disclosure: The author is short SNDK.

2353425,20411,2014-07-29T14:03:27-04:00,SNDK has excellent EPS growth rates.It actually has interesting valuation metrics as well.But the stock price is falling and price is what makes us money.,"Long-term fundamental observations suggest that SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) has been through a series of earnings growth peaks and valleys since 2010, and most recently a peak in earnings growth seems to have come. Earnings growth has been decelerating, and that would be a major concern if the PE multiple reflected the growth rate from the recent peak, but the PE multiple is much lower than that, suggesting that there may actually be value in shares of SNDK after the stock finds legs again.SanDisk has been selected as the Stock of the Week by Stock Traders Daily this week. SanDisk has recently come under pressure after releasing earnings that did not satisfy Wall Street. According to our observations, the company is still growing, but it may have more room to decline before investors should take action.In our yearly EPS growth chart below, we compare trailing 12-month data on a YOY basis to determine yearly trailing 12-month EPS growth, and from this fundamental observation we can see that SNDK recently was growing EPS by over 100%. Since then, the EPS yearly growth rates have declined to just over 30%, so the company has been growing at a slower pace. The important takeaway is that the company is still growing EPS, just not as fast as before.In addition, fundamentally, the PEG ratio for SNDK given the current P/E and the Current Growth rate is 0.54. Its PEG ratio is less than 1, suggesting that this may even be a value play, and that could make it an option for investors who are looking for growth in securities that may not reflect exaggerated expectations. SNDK is not trading with ridiculous multiples right now, near 15x, and that's actually below its current growth rate.The problem is that the stock has begun to decline, and no one wants to try to catch a falling knife. Technically, there are still no buy signals for SNDK at this time.According to our real time trading report for SNDK, the stock recently broke below midterm support and it is heading down towards longer term support, but it is not quite there yet. Our Stock of the Week call offered a strategy for SNDK this week, and the trade is to short near former levels of midterm support, which have been broken and are now converted into resistance, and target longer term support.The stock appears to be in the process of declining to longer term support, and that could be a very good thing for those investors who are looking to match solid fundamentals (valuation) with a technical buy signal. Although our trade this week is to short the stock, if SNDK tests longer term support investors should take notice. That may be your buy signal.That analysis is for investors, because investors care quite a bit about valuation and EPS growth trends, at least they should, but ultimately price is what makes us money in the stock market, and the selection of SNDK as the Stock of the Week this week was based in large part on the technicals.Because the fundamentals do look interesting, especially with a Current PEG of 0.54, SNDK could be a buy for longer term investors at longer term support as well.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: By Thomas H. Kee Jr. for Stock Traders Daily and neither receive compensation for writing this article from the publicly traded companies listed herein.Additional disclosure: SNDK is recommended as a short at midterm resistance levels this week."

Second quarter revenue of $1.63 billion increased 11 percent on a year-over-year basis and increased 8 percent sequentially. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $329 million, or $1.41 per share, compared to net income of $262 million or $1.06 per share for Q2 2013.

According to management, the margin decline was caused by the following, [i] increased mix of custom embedded solution and [ii] blended price per gigabyte decline was 16%, but cost per gigabyte decline was only 12%. Earnings per share was also aided by a decline of 2.7 million shares outstanding due to share buybacks.

Revenue for Q3 2014 was up 72% versus Q3 2013. The company earned $0.79 per share during the quarter, beating analysts' expectation of $0.70 per share. However, the stock traded down after-hours. Since the company's results were flat versus Q2 2014, the market questioned Micron's outlook going forward. In my previous article, I explained the ""Micron conundrum"":ConclusionSanDisk's Q2 earnings exceeded analysts' expectations. However, its gross margin on a non-GAAP basis declined year-over-year. On a GAAP basis, its gross profit margin and EBITDA margin were flat - unbecoming for a growth stock. The market has high expectations for semiconductor manufacturers like SanDisk and Micron.

2322265,25120,2014-07-18T04:50:28-04:00,"SanDisk reports second quarter earnings which are in line with expectations.Analysts are worried about a weak third quarter sales outlook as SanDisk aims to avoid oversupply which could pressure margins.Despite the soft sales outlook, margins are also seen under continued pressure.As such the 15% sell-off can be justified, especially as shares are still up by a third this year.","SanDisk (SNDK) reported inline results for the second quarter, yet a disappointing outlook for the remainder of the year triggered a fierce sell-off in a general weak market.Shares of the company had seen incredible momentum in recent months in anticipation of the earnings release. This has pushed up expectations for the earnings report too much, and SanDisk's outlook was too disappointing to avoid a fierce sell-off.Highlights For The Second QuarterSanDisk reported second quarter revenues of $1.63 billion which represents 11% growth on an annual basis, while revenues are up 8% from the seasonably weaker first quarter. The topline results were slightly better than analysts have been anticipating, with consensus estimates standing at $1.60 billion.GAAP earnings came in at $274 million, up merely $5 million from last year. Thanks to sizable share repurchases, earnings per share growth was much more impressive. Reported earnings of $1.14 per share rose by eight cents.On a non-GAAP accounting method earnings rose to $1.41 per share which was two pennies above consensus estimates.Key Trends During The QuarterCEO Sanjay Mehrotra was happy with the results especially with the performance of SSDs. These sales now make up 29% of total sales compared to 16% last year.While reported topline sales growth was still solid, SanDisk did experience some margin pressure. Actually the firm managed to boost gross margins by about 70 basis points to 46.5% of sales, while notably operating expenses crept up.Operating income was down by 110 basis points to 25.5% of sales as operating costs rose sharply. The increase in costs was seen amidst all cost categories, with R&D, sales and marketing as well as general and administrative expense growth all outpacing reported revenue growth.ValuationSanDisk has a very strong financial position. On top of the nearly $2.7 billion in cash and short term investments, it holds another $3.6 billion in long term marketable securities. Subtracting the $2.2 billion in convertible debt outstanding, still yields in a comfortable $4 billion net cash position.On a trailing basis, SanDisk has now reported revenues of $6.5 billion on which it net earned about $1.15 billion.Factoring in the big losses following the earnings release, shares are valued at around $21 billion currently. This values operating assets at roughly $17 billion, after subtracting the net cash position held by the business. As such equity is valued at 2.6 times sales and 14-15 times trailing earnings.Strong Performance, But What Does The Future Hold?Over the past decade, SanDisk has aggressively and profitably expanded its operations. Revenues have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of close to 15% per year, boosting revenues from $1.8 billion in 2004 towards $6.5 billion on a trailing basis.With exception of a big loss in 2008 driven by one-time issues, earnings have grown rapidly as well, surpassing the billion mark in the meantime. At the same time, the total dilution of about 20% was limited over the time frame, resulting in rapid growth on a per-share basis.Yet it is very hard to achieve these results going forwards driven by pricing pressure and the increased size of the firm. For the third quarter, things are not looking so good. Sales for the quarter are seen between $1.68 and $1.73 billion, suggesting year-on-year growth is slowing down to 5% at the midpoint of the range. Analysts were looking for sales of $1.74 billion.It appears that the company has deliberately held back on production to avoid oversupply which could crush margins. In the conference call management admitted that demand is not the issue, the weaker third quarter guidance stems from not having enough inventory to meet demand.Not only is the sales guidance a bit soft, analysts are worried about margin pressure as well. This most likely results from SanDisk supplying to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which given its superior position can likely demand favorable prices. As such average selling prices are declining quicker than costs, putting pressure on gross margins.Takeaway For (Potential) InvestorsBack in June of this year, I last checked out the prospects for investors in SanDisk following the acquisition of Fusion-Io, which gave the company a stronger position in the SSD market.I liked the strategic nature of the deal and the ""timing"" of the acquisition with SanDisk acquiring shares at a 70% discount from Fusion-Io's all-time highs. The $1.1 billion deal allows SanDisk to gain a greater foothold in the SSD market which the company expects to grow from $5 billion in 2013 to about $8 billion by 2015.Shares started the year around $70 and have simply seen too much momentum. Since the middle of April shares have risen from $75 to highs of $109, for returns exceeding 40% without seeing any meaningful correction until now.While a double-digit correction to $95 per share seems very dramatic, I certainly believe that this correction should be seen in consideration with the huge gains being made over the past few months. This is as expectations have simply risen too much, too quickly.While the risk-reward position has improved following the news, shares still trade at elevated levels, and I don't necessarily believe that current levels are a great entry opportunity.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2356065,80135,2014-07-30T00:16:00-04:00,Weak guidance amid supply issues initiated a sell-off resulting in 13% valuation drop.SanDisk is expected to grow in line with industry growth as capacity issue will be eliminated by mid-2015.Sell-off is an opportunity that entails growth potential of around 20%.Valuation reveals price target of $109.,"SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ: SNDK) was the worst stock market performer during the day that followed its earnings report. The stock lost around 13% of its value in just one day. Investors ignored the revenue and the EPS beat as the company gave weak guidance for the next quarter. A relatively lower margin was also not welcomed by the investor. Hence, the stock tumbled. But this seems to be an opportunity to extract capital benefit because of favorable industry growth prospects, technology leadership and market leadership of SanDisk. The fact that fundamentals are quite healthy, and SanDisk is trading rather cheaply on PE basis, adds to the reasons why this stock holds capital appreciation potential. Detailed analysis of catalysts along with the thesis follows.Business summarySanDisk belongs to the data storage devices industry. It designs, manufactures and sells NAND based storage products for enterprises and consumers. Products of the company range from microSD, embedded storage to SSD. The company generates most of its revenue from removable segment. Removable segment, including products such as cards, USB flash drives and audio/video players, contributed 43% towards the revenue during year ended 2013. However, the concentration is shifting towards SSD segment lately. This trend is positive for SanDisk as enterprise and consumer SSD market is expected to grow in coming years.Recent guidanceIn the second-quarter results, SanDisk provided guidance for third-quarter 2014. It expects revenue to be in the range of $1.675-$1.725 billion as compared to the consensus estimate of $1.735 billion. Gross margin is expected to be in the range of 47%-49% as compared to 48% in Q2 and 51% in Q1. Slightly weak revenue guidance can be explained by supply constraints of SanDisk. The company increased its capacity by a mere 5% during the year. Cautious cost control may be the reason behind it. On margin front, embedded segment revenue increased in previous few quarters. Apple, a 20% customer (2013), is ramping up iPhone 6. Analysts believe that iPhone has a relatively low-margin revenue due to pricing power of Apple. According to Wedbush analyst, Betsy Van Hees, the weak outlook is ""more attributed to the pricing power that Apple has."" Investors were quite optimistic because of Apple's iPhone 6 ramp-up. But, that was not going to be a high-margin business because of Apple's position in price negotiations. Investors overreacted to weak guidance situation and the stock lost 13% of its value in one day. Anyhow, embedded will always drive the margin down in future either because of powerful customers or because of emerging market growth. But, the point is, enterprise and client SSD will drive growth and margin of the company going forward. Things are not bad for SanDisk. Apart from that, lower guidance on revenue and margin doesn't materially affect the valuation of the company (details in valuation segment). And, I believe the sell-off was not justified. SanDisk is an established NAND storage player, and it will most probably grow in line with the growth of the industry.Industry prospects and SanDiskGrowth of smartphones, tablets, and IoT will drive the growth of NAND based storage. Moreover, the overwhelming need to store and access data frequently places NAND based storage in the driving seat for growth amid its superior performance over mechanical disks. There are favorable indicators in the NAND industry. Demand is currently exceeding supply. NAND total addressable market is expected to grow at CAGR of 10% until 2017; as evident from the above presented chart. There are also some challenges. Scaling and cost benefits are not seen beyond 15nm, and hence the industry is moving towards 3D NAND; Samsung being the first mover. Despite the rise of 3D NAND, 2D will remain mainstream for the next few years due to high costs associated with the 3D NAND technology.Why SanDisk?SanDisk is going to benefit from the growth of the industry because of its established position and leading edge technology. In embedded segment, SanDisk is the supplier to leading smartphone manufacturer i.e. Apple. In client SSD, the company's products are qualified by top 10 OEMs. On enterprise SSD front, six out of seven enterprise storage vendors qualified SanDisk's products. The company recently won 2TB optimus SAS SSD tier one enterprise storage player OEM, probably Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC), qualification. So, SanDisk seems to be a very established NAND storage player.Secondly, the company is leading in process technology. The company is now transitioning to 15nm process, which is by far the most advance node as far as storage manufacturing is concerned. We have seen Intel lead the semiconductor industry by keeping the lead in node process technology. Same holds true for SanDisk if it manages to keep up. Note that Samsung holds the lead in 3D NAND but it is too early to choose winners in 3D department as the technology is in its infancy. Furthermore, the supply problem will be resolved next year as the company is building a new manufacturing facility in Malaysia. So, apart from risk posed by Samsung's 3D NAND in the long run, SanDisk seems to have no problem in the short term because of its superior 2D NAND technology and established relationships with OEMs and enterprise clients.Financial performance and investment valueIt can easily be assumed that weak guidance is a justification for such deep discounted valuation. This is not the case for SanDisk. The company along with the industry is set to grow in coming years. The guidance may be weak but yet it incorporates a growth of 4.6%. The point being, growth is not halted even when the guidance is on the low side. Revenue and EPS are expected to grow in future. See the chart that follows:The chart incorporates low-side revenue estimates to reflect lower guidance and margin pressure going forward. It can be seen that growth is still instilled in revenue. However, this is a very pessimistic revenue projection, which SanDisk will surpass. The point to mention this graph is that growth is not going to halt despite lower guidance.Now, to a more important point; even if SanDisk just matches low-side earnings estimates going forward, it will remain attractive on a PE basis. Earnings estimates are as follows:Industry average PE is around 22.40, while SanDisk's PE ttm is around 19.25. The stock will be a cheap preposition at current price as forward PE is below industry average. Note that these EPS estimates are based on low-side earnings. Industry is set to grow at CAGR of 10%, and Yahoo Finance and Reuters mention EPS growth of 25% per annum for the next five years. So, the estimates are on an extreme low-side. Therefore, despite weak guidance, SanDisk is a value proposition for equity investor.ValuationAssumptionsThe price target reveals that SanDisk has potential to grow by 18%. Several factors will contribute toward achieving or surpassing this target including:Final thoughtsSanDisk is an attractive investment option despite weak guidance for the next quarter. In fact, the guidance itself created this capital appreciation opportunity. SanDisk will reward its investors to the tune of 20%. The stock is a definitely a buy.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2317715,31441,2014-07-16T10:50:42-04:00,"SanDisk is expected to announce 2Q earnings today.The company is experiencing double digit revenue growth quarter-over-quarter, while achieving meaningful gains in EBITDA margin.If it repeats its past performance for 2Q 2014, it will exceed analysts' earnings expectations of $1.39 per share for the quarter.","SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK) is a global leader in NAND flash storage solutions. NAND flash products are electronically re-writeable semiconductor memory devices that retain content when power is turned off. NAND flash-based storage devices are utilized in mobile phones, computers, and industrial and automotive applications. This product group also includes removable storage devices, such as USB and Flash memory cards.Historically, flash memory cards for USB drives and imaging devices represented the majority of SanDisk's revenue. With the emergence of mobile products- smartphones and tablets - sales of embedded and removable NAND flash solutions for the mobile market have grown to represent the lion's share of revenue. Below is the company's historical operating performance:RevenueEBITDAValuationAt a market capitalization of $23.9 billion, SanDisk trades at about 20.9x LTM0314 net income. The company also has an enterprise value of $25.1 billion, which equates to 11.3x LTM0314 EBITDA. These multiples are attractive given the top line growth spurred by mobile device revenue and the potential for EBITDA expansion due to economies of scale.Analysts' ExpectationsSanDisk announces earnings for 2Q 2014 today. The average analyst estimate is $1.39 per share, an increase of about 15% over 2Q 2013 actual results. The company's Q1 2014 net income of $269 million represents a 69% increase above Q1 2013 net income of $166 million. If SanDisk comes close to repeating this performance for Q2 2014, it will shoot the lights out like its competitor, Micron Technology Inc.

Under the terms of the agreement, SanDisk will buy all outstanding shares of Fusion-io for $11.25 per share – a 20% premium to the market price. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the third quarter. SanDisk is looking to beef up its enterprise storage offerings, as Fusion-io specializes in solid-state storage systems. Fusion-io has over 7,000 worldwide customers and generated over $400 million in revenues in its fiscal 2013.Flash Storage Solutions Provider Fusion-io is a storage hardware and software systems manufacturer that provides flash-based storage solutions to enterprise clients including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The company provides storage products such as flash hardware that accelerates the performance of servers and applications, as well as hybrid flash arrays that support virtual machines (VMs). Fusion-io also provides application solutions that enhance the performance of hypervisor and virtual desktop deployments from leading virtualization providers such as VMware (NYSE:VMW) and Citrix (NASDAQ:CTXS). Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak serves as chief scientist at Fusion-io.The Seagate-Avago deal left Fusion-io in a very vulnerable position. Fusion-io’s stock price rose last year when Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) acquired Virident, as there were rumors that Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) would react by acquiring Fusion-io. With Seagate acquiring LSI’s flash business from Avago Technology (NASDAQ:AVGO), Fusion-io was left to compete with storage giants – Seagate, Western Digital and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) – rather than being acquired by one of them. Fusion-io’s stock price was over $11 in March but declined to $8 in May. Since that time, the company’s stock hovered in the $8-8.50 range until SanDisk made the announcement to acquire Fusion-io.Acquisition And Its Impact SanDisk’s solid state drive (SSD) sales have consistently increased in the last couple of years, with the revenue contribution of SSDs increasing from 9% of net revenues in 2012 to about 19% in 2013. The revenue contribution of SSDs (which includes enterprise storage products and embedded storage for mobile devices) further grew to 28% of net revenues in Q1 2014. Competing storage manufacturers such as Western Digital have also reported an increase in enterprise SSD revenues in eight consecutive quarters prior to its most recent quarter. In the last couple of years, SanDisk has tried to position itself as an enterprise storage provider rather than a manufacturer of removable storage cards for cameras and smartphones. SSDs have significantly higher margins than removable memory chips and USB drives, which is the reason why solid state drives contribute more value to the manufacturer than memory cards and USB drives.According to SanDisk’s management, the company will have the “broadest enterprise flash solution portfolio” in the industry with Fusion-io products and solutions in its offering. The growth in digital HD content worldwide has led enterprise storage shipments to grow due to demand from data centers. Flash-based storage is increasingly becoming popular with these data centers due to a low cost of ownership, durable storage and faster access (read/write speeds) than traditional storage platforms. Fusion-io has products with large flash cache storage, which makes streaming, storing and reading data much faster. SanDisk is propagating the idea of all-flash data centers, which would help clients manage heavy data workloads with low capital expenses. Fusion-io fits in perfectly with this vision by providing the necessary technology and range of solutions required for the transformation.Though Fusion-io has more than doubled its revenues from its fiscal 2011 to 2013, the company made a net loss in two of these three years. With SanDisk’s worldwide network and channel partners (boosted by its partnership with Avnet), it can integrate Fusion-io’s technology with its products and cater to a significantly larger customer base than what Fusion-io could manage. Additionally, Fusion-io will stop sourcing its storage chips from Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) once the acquisition is complete. This would provide an added benefit to SanDisk via its chip manufacturing channel. We currently forecast SanDisk’s share of SSD gigabytes to increase to almost 12% by the end of our forecast period. The Fusion-io acquisition could help the company increase its share on the back of increased software-defined storage offerings. If the company’s SSD market share increases to about 15% by the end of our forecast period, it could imply a 7%-8% upside to our $86 price estimate for SanDisk.Disclosure: No positions."

Its major customers are Apple  and Facebook (44% of revenue).Now, with the Enterprise SSD market expected to grow from $3B to about $8B by 2017, and considering Fusion-io's blue-chip customer base, SanDisk is technically landing a bargain.","SanDisk Corporation (SNDK), the California-based storage devices company, announced on June 16, 2014, that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Fusion-io Inc. (NYSE:FIO), the solid state based input output solutions provider used in enterprise data centers.SanDisk will buy all outstanding shares of Fusion-io at a price of $11.25 each, totaling to a deal value of $1.1 billion. Fusion-io's stock opened 23% up on June 16, 2014, due to the buy-out announcement, while SanDisk Corporation's stock was also up 3.5% post acquisition announcement the following day. However, Fusion-io shares are now down to about $11.26 a share, which is close to the offer price.In general, Fusion-io shareholders could have cashed in to profit on the event-driven rally following the announcement of the merger, as the stock is now evening to the offer price. On the other hand, SanDisk shareholders are now anticipating what would likely change the picture of the company in the SSD and Flash memory market as it seeks to dominate the industry in the coming years.So why exactly is this deal so important to SanDisk?Fusion-io's top-notch clientele and product offeringFusion-io's core business is developing solid-state based memory and iO solutions for enterprise databases. Its major customers are Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) (44% of revenue).While for some this appears to be a dangerous over-reliance on a few companies for a significant chunk of revenues, this also provides SanDisk with an access to blue-chip customers in the Enterprise SSD market.Furthermore, once the merger is completed, the product mix will include SanDisk's own products and portfolio of clients thereby hedging the risk of over-reliance.Fusion-io's other offerings include PCIe storage and ioControl, which have high growth potential in the near term as a solid state alternative to current platforms (Nimble, Nutanix).Fusion-io's product mix will enrich SanDisk with IP portfolio in enterprise storage technology, which SanDisk can market to its enterprise customers using its vertically integrated structure and worldwide reach.Therefore, the merger is not merely a matter of adding up units, but also outlines a clear strategy that could result in notable revenue and operational synergies.The price paid (21% Premium) appears cheap in the long termSanDisk, which has a cash balance of ~ 1 billion and reserves worth ~ 7 billion, will make the buy-out entirely by cash. The offer price of $11.25 per share offers a premium of ~21% to the closing price of June 13, 2014. Following the tender offer announcement, the price of Fusion-io surged to $11.36 on the close of June 16, 2014.The company's 21% purchase of Fusion-io will hit the books soon, but the benefits are not expected to begin trickling in until 2016. SanDisk has announced that the tender offer will be complete by Q3 2014.The purchase of Fusion-io (market cap: $1.23 bn) is attractive for SanDisk (market cap: $20 bn) due to cheap valuation of Fusion-io, whose book value had reduced to ~$5 per share following its poor results in CY2014. The acquisition values Fusion-io at about 2.4x in forward P/S, based on the 2015 estimates.Now, with the Enterprise SSD market expected to grow from $3B to about $8b by 2017, and considering Fusion-io's blue chip customer base, SanDisk is technically landing a bargain, which aligns well with its long-term strategy.SanDisk reported a 125% increase in EPS to $5.35 in FY2013 beating Street estimates. In 2014, the company envisages higher volumes in retail storage devices and continued strong demand in mobile phone sales.This means that a good company is about to become great, as it seeks to cement its position in a market that promises substantial growth over the next three years.SanDisk, which is currently fifth in the Enterprise SSD market, is planning to become the largest player by 2017 and the acquisition of Fusion-io, which is one of the top five players in the enterprise SSD market, will greatly enable SanDisk to achieve its 2017 market share target.In addition, SanDisk's UltraDIMM platform for servers can add flash capability to traditional PCIe platform (which is Fusion-io's product). The addition of PCIe IP from this acquisition will help SanDisk sell UltraDIMM to existing PCIe customers with improved capability.Good does not come without a few obstaclesSanDisk's share price has increased 53% since January 2014 following better-than-expected results in 2013 and Q1 2014. The announcement of the Acquisition of Fusion-io could not have come at a better time, as the stock has since continued with its rally. There are significant positives associated with this deal, all be it, for the long-term investor.Now, as noted, the 21% premium on the price paid to acquire Fusion-io appears to be cheap based on the long-term benefits associated with the deal. The IP portfolio acquired a big chunk of enterprise customers of Fusion-io and should provide revenue synergies in the long term, especially in the Flash Memory and SSD markets.The company forecasts to begin booking the benefits from FY2016 onwards, which means patience would be critical in assessing the sensibility of the acquisition.The tender offer completion and regulatory approval are slated to happen at some point before the end of the year, while at the same time, some investigations are already underway regarding the deal.Some also are questioning the pricing of the deal, suggesting that it may not be in the best interest of Fusion shareholders. This in a way seems to be backing the argument that SanDisk could be landing a bargain acquisition.Is SanDisk really getting a bargain?Fusion-io traded at about $9.30 per share before the acquisition. At this point, the shares had plunged 22.5% from a high of about $12 reached on March 12.Now, upon the announcement of the deal, the stock rallied to trade at about $11.36 per share. Therefore, based on the pre-acquisition price of $9.30, the deal looks fair.However, consider the fact that on March 12, shares of Fusion-io traded at about $12.00 per share. From this perspective, one could argue that Fusion-io shares could have potentially recovered to trade close to the $12.00 per share reported in March, in which case it would mean, Fusion-io shareholders have been cheated, thereby rendering the acquisition a bargain.Therefore, the plunge from $12.00 to $9.30 appears to have made SanDisk's offer of $11.25 per share appear to be an attractive premium, but in real sense, this is a discount price compared to Fusion's valuation of about 3 prior to the acquisition. In other words, SanDisk struck the deal at the right time for its shareholders.Also notice that Fusion-io had already resumed upward trend just before the deal, rallying from a low of about $7.90 to about $9.28, this indicates that the stock was recovering, and could have potentially gained even higher, assuming that this uptrend had nothing to do with the deal.This is perhaps the reason why some Fusion-io shareholders may feel cheated in the end.ConclusionWhile SanDisk arguably appears to have landed a bargain in acquiring Fusion-io, the real value is based on long-term revenue synergies. The inevitable dominance of the SSD market is crucial in justifying SanDisk's acquisition of Fusion-io.The industry remains attractive, which means competition is rife. Therefore, Fusion-io appears to be a magnificent addition to SanDisk's product mix, and sets it well for long-term success in the market.Nonetheless, successful integration of Fusion-io business into SanDisk will have to be closely watched for sustaining the long-term up-trend in the stock.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Our yearly earnings growth chart below demonstrates that growth trend. In this chart we compare trailing 12 month data on an annual basis to determine yearly growth rates. For example, we calculate the trailing 12 month data from this quarter and compare it to the trailing 12 month data from the same quarter of the previous year to determine yearly growth rates for earnings.For SanDisk, the company saw a trough in earnings growth trends in the first quarter of 2013, and since then earnings have been growing rapidly. Almost like clockwork, the stock also responded nicely to the change in earnings growth trends. The stock has accelerated as earnings growth accelerated and at current levels SanDisk trades at 22 times earnings.Interestingly, although this is higher than the multiple for the market itself, SanDisk has been growing much faster than the market and higher PE multiples are therefore warranted. The only concern comes from that observation of growth back in 2013. The stock responded quite nicely to the shift in growth trends from the trough, but according to our earnings growth chart a reversal from a recent peak in earnings growth may also be taking place. If that is true and the stock responds to slower earnings growth like it did to accelerated earnings growth back in 2013 it could be a precursor.For traders, our real time trading report for SNDK suggests that the company is poised to test its longer term resistance level, so there is additional upside according to our report, but only modest upside potential until resistance is tested. In fact, if resistance is tested we would then expect the stock to turn lower and fall all the way to the longer term support level identified in our report.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: By Thomas H.

2316215,23479,2014-07-15T16:52:57-04:00,"SanDisk Corporation is scheduled to announce its second quarter earnings on July 16.SanDisk has given a revenue guidance range of $1.5 billion-1.62 billion for the current quarter.SanDisk recently announced its intention to acquire flash storage solutions provider Fusion-io for $1.1 billion, which could be completed by the end of the third quarter.The acquisition could help the company outperform its revenue guidance of $6.4 billion-$6.8 billion for the full year.","SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK) is scheduled to announce its second quarter earnings on July 16. On the back of strong Q1 results, the company posted slightly higher revenues than the upper end of its guidance of $1.5 billion. SanDisk has given a revenue guidance range of $1.5 billion-1.62 billion for the current quarter. SanDisk recently announced its intention to acquire flash storage solutions provider Fusion-io for $1.1 billion, which could be completed by the end of the third quarter. The acquisition could help the company outperform its revenue guidance of $6.4 billion-$6.8 billion for the full year.SanDisk has witnessed a change in its revenue mix in recent years, with the contribution of solid state drive (SSD) sales increasing from 9% of net revenues in 2012 to over 19% in 2013. This trend has continued in 2014, with 28% of net Q1 revenues coming from SSD product sales. Consequently, SanDisk has consistently posted improved margins due to an increasing mix of high-margin enterprise-class and client SSDs. The company’s non-GAAP gross margins stood at 51% in Q1 – its highest ever in the first quarter – owing to strong SSD sales, especially enterprise-class SSDs. The company could revise its gross margin expectation from 45% for the full year if the increasing mix of SSDs further improves margins in Q2.Solid State Drives to Continue Growth SanDisk generated 28% of its revenues from SSDs in last quarter. Comparatively, the contribution of these high-margin SSDs was 19% in 2013. With user data increasingly moving to the cloud, storage demand from data centers is increasing. Since SSDs provide efficient storage through higher Input/Output per Second (IOPS) and low latency, they are increasingly becoming a preferred option for enterprises. Over the next few quarters, the company expects the contribution of SSDs to stay at nearly Q1 levels due to the expected growth in enterprise storage demand and its new products. Although the Fusion-io acquisition could help SanDisk overtake its nearest rivals in the enterprise SSD market, the company could continue to face stiff competition from major storage providers such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Samsung (PINK:SSNLF).Fusion-io, Software-Defined Storage and New Trends SanDisk’s Fusion-io acquisition makes sense for the company on two fronts. Firstly, SanDisk will have the “broadest enterprise flash solution portfolio” in the industry with Fusion-io products added to its portfolio. Fusion-io’s hardware, which helps accelerate performance and innovative flash caching solutions, should help SanDisk further contribute to the growing SSD division. Secondly, SanDisk mentioned that Fusion-io will now source its chips from SanDisk rather than competitor Samsung, which is likely to provide a boost to SanDisk’s wafers and components division.SanDisk upgraded its Flashsoft software in Q4 last year with the intention of capitalizing on the growing demand for software-defined storage. The software for enterprise storage solutions uses host-based caching for VMware’s (NYSE:VMW) vSphere environments. This means that Flashsoft software enables a standard SSD to be used as a high-speed caching memory for enterprise-level storage devices. The memory drive acting as cache increases its IOPS, which improves performance and reduces latency. With such flexibility, SanDisk aims to capture the attention of IT departments that are contemplating the switch to flash arrays. Although flash arrays are gaining traction in the industry, switching to arrays is still costly. This new market could provide long term growth opportunities to SanDisk.In May, SanDisk announced its deal with Toshiba to produce 3-D NAND Chips. Both companies agreed to convert their existing joint facility in Japan to produce 3-D NAND chips from 2016. As the storage densities of presently available chips near the end of their physical limitations to store more data, 3-D chips could be the next big things as they can store up to 16 times more data than planar or 2-D chips. Over the next five years, SanDisk and Toshiba intend to capitalize on the growth expected in 3-D technology and compete with rival Samsung, who already has the first mover advantage.Disclosure: No positions."
2226963,36021,2014-05-20T01:51:55-04:00,A comparison of two strong memory companies.SanDisk has some weaknesses that might not be easily overcome.Micron's weaknesses will get fixed in the near future.,"This will be some attempt at analyzing the operational strengths and weaknesses of these two fine memory companies. I will miss something; that's what the comments section is for.SanDisk (SNDK) positives:1. SanDisk is NAND only. At times, specialization in a product category is a definite advantage.2. SanDisk generates 12% of its revenue as license and royalties on NAND flash technology. Since royalty revenue is virtually cost free, about 35% of operating profit comes from royalty revenue. After tax earnings are about 37% from royalties.3. About 40% of SanDisk revenue is in the retail sector for such things as thumb drives and SD memory cards.4. Toshiba is the manufacturing partner for SanDisk. Toshiba is the sole surviving Japanese memory manufacturer. Since the 1970s, Toshiba has had a reputation as an exceptionally competent semiconductor manufacturer.SanDisk negatives:1. SanDisk is NAND only. Specialization is a two-edged sword. Not having a full line of memory products can leave a supplier open to package leveraging by competitors. SanDisk is unable to move NAND production to DRAM if the market requires it.2. Royalties: License and royalty revenue are based on patents. Patents expire and these patents are getting long in the tooth. Therefore, 37% of net earnings are at risk.3. Expansion of production facilities will be time consuming and highly visible.Micron (NASDAQ:MU) positives:1. Broad supplier of various memory technologies. Can move production back and forth between DRAM and NAND. Can supply a complete package of product to key customers.2. Micron (and IMFT) are the only NAND manufacturers that do not pay royalties to SanDisk.3. At nearly three times the size of SanDisk, Micron has the advantage of scale.4. Micron has a globally diversified manufacturing base. Remember the Hynix fire?5. Micron has Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for a technology and manufacturing partner. The IMFT (Intel Micron Flash Technologies) joint venture is a huge and flexible resource for both Intel and Micron.6. Micron is in production with the smallest 2D NAND geometry node (16nm)Micron negatives:1. Micron is a step behind Samsung and Hynix in DRAM technology. Micron is still on the 30nm node, but expects to move to 25 and 20 nm during 2014.2. Micron is about a billion dollars smaller than SanDisk in NAND memory.3. Micron is lagging SanDisk in SSD shipments. Micron was busy buying Elpida while SanDisk was buying third-party SSD companies.Given the above, my personal favorite of these two great companies is Micron by a large margin.The reason that Micron is the only NAND supplier to not pay royalties to SanDisk is that all the Micron NAND operations began as Intel business units and Intel and SanDisk signed a flash memory patent cross license back in 1995.Depending on the source, NAND based solid state drives are growing at least at a 50% compound annual rate at the expense of HDDs (Hard Disk Drives). There is no question that the memory companies will need more NAND fab capacity in the near future.Now here's the gotcha about that. All other NAND manufacturers will have to spend $5 billion plus for new fabs and wait 2-3 years for output. Micron, through IMFT, will likely have access to the surplus Intel fabs. When the conversion to 14nm is complete at Intel, there should be several, fully-depreciated, but still modern, 22nm fabs available for the IMFT joint venture.Let me guess that an excess 22nm Intel fab capable of 80K NAND WSPM should be depreciated down to land and building or about $1 billion. If this fab were moved to IMFT, Micron would pay $500 million to Intel (via IMFT) for the fab and another $500 million ($1 billion total, $500 million from Intel) to re-fit it for memory. The end result is that Micron would have $1 billion in a fab valued (to re-produce) at $2.5 billion. That would result in 40% of the depreciation of building new. For Intel's share, the new depreciable cost would be $500 million or 20% of the depreciation expense of building new.According to DRAMeXchange, asset depreciation for memory manufacturers is 40-50% of the total cost to produce these parts. In the above magical move, Intel becomes the industry's low cost NAND producer with only about 8-10% depreciation and Micron becomes the second to the lowest cost producer at 16-20% depreciation. Does this cost structure push 3D NAND back even further?So, in summary, this year Micron will fix their position in DRAM to become competitive in scale and cost to Samsung.Sometime in the future Micron be able to bring on additional NAND capacity faster and at lower cost than any competitor as the demand for SSDs grows. Both of these moves add multiple billions of dollars in revenue to Micron's already annualized $16 billion sales.There is still a double in Micron, but it won't be easy on the nerves. If roller coasters make you sick find another 100% sure-thing gainer.Good Luck.Disclosure: I am long MU, INTC. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

2250723,66313,2014-06-03T10:39:23-04:00,SanDisk's record run over the past 17 months leaves little or no room for the fundamentals to waver.A closer look at historical data reveals SanDisk's current price per share is rich in valuation.Considering a few alternative price-to-earnings scenarios shows SanDisk's price target could be much lower.,"SanDisk's (SNDK) current valuation relative to fundamentals could be setting up a sell/short opportunity, should ANY current expectations fall short.A Historic Run For SanDisk CorporationOver the course of 2013, SanDisk's stock price rose 57.67% to over $70 per share. During that same year, SanDisk's revenues grew 22% and its operating margin came in at 25%. During 2014, SanDisk's price per share has enjoyed another 39% to the upside, reaching over $96 per share (as of June 2, 2014).During the first quarter of 2014, revenues came in at $1.51 billion, down 12% sequentially, but still up from $1.34 billion same quarter last year. This decline in revenues is attributed to a seasonally slow quarter for the flash memory maker. Equally impressive were the gross margins, coming in at 49.7%.So, what's the problem? In short, a closer look behind the numbers reveals a stock price reflecting little or no risk to achieving perfection going forward. In fact, based upon our research, the downside may soon be much more attractive than further price appreciation.Valuation by the NumbersAlthough recent analyst upgrades attempt to justify higher share prices, we caution investors SanDisk's current value may be priced to perfection going forward. The table below shows several valuation ratios, and suggests SanDisk could be considerably overvalued.* Data as of 5/30/2014Virtually every metric shows the valuations are stretched. SanDisk's current ratios demonstrate elevated levels when compared to industry averages, 5-year historical values, and even S&P 500 corporate data. Perhaps these ratios have created an irrational exuberance toward future expectations.Annual earnings estimates for 2014 average $6.24 a share, giving SanDisk a growth rate of approximately 44%. Using this average estimate, SanDisk's forward PE ratio is 14.4. While that number may seem achievable, considerations for a number of outlying risks may not be accounted for. In other words, the current price per share assumes virtually zero adverse effects from changes among SanDisk competitors, as well as any deterioration in flash memory pricing.Risks for ConsiderationGiven the fact the NAND flash memory industry is commodity-like in nature, SanDisk competes against numerous companies with significant scale, most notably Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Micron (NASDAQ:MU), and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF). Should pricing wars heat up, SanDisk's gross margins would certainly be in jeopardy. In fact, early evidence suggests competition within the NAND market could soon tilt supply in a way that would ultimately drop prices up to 20%, and even negatively impact demand. This scenario would be very similar to the environment in 2012.Although numerous analysts have recently upgraded price targets exceeding $110 per share, we believe current price levels have created a ""big risk-little reward"" scenario. Insiders seem to agree. They have been net sellers of the stock all year, and have increased in numbers during April and May (Vickers Stock Research). Institutions have also been reducing their position with net selling.Bottom LineConsidering SanDisk five-year average price to earnings ratio of 15.9 (see previous table for averages) and current earnings estimates of $6.24 a share for 2014, we believe SanDisk would be fully valued at $100 per share (if not overvalued). This would also assume the industry environment and growth expectations are either met or exceeded.Given the increased competition and scale among manufacturers, we believe price wars and technological evolution over coming quarters will put pressure on memory prices, ultimately reducing earnings per share for SanDisk to a range between $5.25-$5.35/share. Therefore, using a PE multiple of 15.9, we target fair value around $84/share.We are not the only research group coming to this conclusion. S&P Capital IQ currently has SanDisk's 12-month price target at $86/share. And according to Argus Research Company's April 21st report on SanDisk, the price target for April of 2015 was set at $92/share (even with a Buy rating).In closing, we recommend stockholders sell shares at current levels, or at least hedge their positions with long-term puts. Should SanDisk go north of hundred dollars per share, we would certainly consider a short position in the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in SNDK over the next 72 hours.

2227223,56962,2014-05-20T05:19:45-04:00,"SanDisk Corp. was recently upgraded by Raymond James from outperform to strong buy. The firm raised its price target on SanDisk’s stock from $90 to $115 indicating handsome upside potential.SanDisk projects the Total Addressable Market ""TAM"" for NAND Flash will grow at a CAGR of around 8% from 2013 to 2016 due to an increase in data required for.The company has also recently reached an agreement with Arrow Electronics Inc. to expand distribution of flash storage solutions to new regions worldwide.SanDisk’s board of directors has recently approved a 33% increase in the company’s quarterly dividend payment to $0.30 per share ($1.20 per share on an annual basis).","SanDisk Corp. (SNDK), the leading designer, developer, and manufacturer of data storage solutions such as flash memory, proprietary controller and firmware technologies, was recently upgraded by Raymond James to strong buy from outperform. The firm raised its price target to $115 from $90 while the stock is currently trading at around $90.93. ISI Group has also upgraded SanDisk from neutral to strong buy. Analyst C.J. Muse has also boosted his price target on SanDisk from $87 to $110. Therefore, in this article I will analyze SanDisk as an investment opportunity and discuss some of the factors that are likely to drive the stock higher.Growing SSD Demand and Improvement in Bottom LineSanDisk received a sign of approbation from some analysts following its annual analyst day meeting at the beginning of May 2014. During the meeting the company was able to convince analysts regarding its expectations to serve in the leading position with respect to capitalizing on the growing Solid State Drive ""SSD"" market. SanDisk projects the Total Addressable Market ""TAM"" for NAND Flash will grow at a CAGR of around 8% from 2013 to 2016 (see graph below).Source: SNDK Raymond James 35th Annual Conference PresentationAccording to David West, vice president of semiconductor marketing and engineering for Arrow Electronics Inc. (NYSE:ARW), users from all fields ranging from transportation, healthcare, mobile devices to other commercial markets are distinguishing the noteworthy performance, reliability, and cost-saving benefits of flash storage.Raymond James also anticipates that the trend for solid-state drives is impressive enough and will continue growing in the coming periods. The firm noted that the 3D NAND industry cycle will be lengthier than historical patterns and SanDisk has a longer-term mix shift on the road to higher value enterprise SSDs and 2D NAND cost advantages.According to IHS, SSDs are expected to grasp over one-third of the PC storage solutions market by 2017. The total global shipments of SSDs in PCs are predicted to grow by a factor of seven rising from 31 million units in 2012 to 227 million units by 2017. This growth will be made as SSDs become more significant to PC makers and other buyers due to lower cost as SSDs have the NAND flash memory present at the core of the storage devices. ISI Group also acknowledged the fact that the enterprise storage demand is picking up. This will drive growth in the date to be stored but at a lower cost. The analyst also expects that SanDisk has an evident path to cost improvements on planar NAND as the supply and demand for NAND is anticipated to remain in balance till 2015. The design of NAND flash memory chips connected in a series bear a resemblance to a NAND gate. This allows the series connection to use less space than a corresponding connection, reducing the cost of NAND flash drives.Additionally, as SanDisk purchases all of its NAND flash supply from the company's venture relationships with Toshiba Corporation (OTCPK:TOSBF) the company's gross profit margins are susceptible to USD/JPY exchange rate. The weakening of JPY against USD favorably impacts the company's gross margins. According to Scotiabank's report on foreign exchange outlook issued recently in May 2014, the bank forecast JPY to depreciate against USD in 2014 and 2015. The bank expects the Bank of Japan to ultimately turn towards further stimulus that will drive USD/JPY to 109 by the end of 2014.Marketing ExpansionSanDisk and Arrow Electronics, Inc. has recently agreed to jointly market commercial flash storage solutions around the globe. Arrow Electronics is a leading global technology distributor. It has agreed to expand its distribution agreement to embrace new regions and a broader portfolio of SanDisk solutions for the mobile and industrial sectors. This expanded partnership is aimed to address the growing demand for flash storage around the globe. Arrow Electronics will offer a wide-ranging variety of SanDisk commercial flash storage solutions to its more than 100,000 wide-reaching customers.This new global partnership will facilitate SanDisk's leveraging of Arrow Electronics' global distribution model and engineering resources. This will support an ease for system architects and design engineers to alter their systems with SanDisk flash technology. According to Henri Richard, senior vice president of Worldwide Commercial Sales and Support at SanDisk, Arrow Electronics' strong distribution network and customer-centric services will be in tandem with SanDisk's commitment of providing trusted, next-generation flash storage solutions to the mobile and industrial sectors around the globe.As a result of this agreement, Arrow Electronics will become part of the fast-growing SanDisk Commercial Business Channel. This channel will offer clients and enterprise-grade SSDs and embedded flash computing products via channel partners around the globe and is likely to record more growth in the coming years.Dividend Hike, Q1 FY 2014 Results and Final TakeConfident in the future prospects of its business, SanDisk has recently publicized that its board of directors has approved a 33% increase in the company's quarterly dividend payment to $0.30 per share ($1.20 per share on an annual basis). This scheduled increase will be applied for dividends declared the beginning in Q3 FY 2014 one year after the dividend program was instigated.SanDisk reported its Q1 FY 2014 results in the previous month. The company disclosed that its Q1 EPS of $1.44 beat the analysts' estimate of $1.25 by $0.19. The company's revenue for Q1 FY 2014 came in at $1.51 billion also beating the consensus estimate of $1.49 billion. The 61% growth in the company's SSD revenue and strong retail performance drove the growth in the company's top and bottom lines. In Q1 FY 2013, the company reported an EPS of $0.84 on revenues of $1.34 billion.The company appears to be well-positioned to take advantage of the growing SSD market. The SSD market with NAND flash memory will continue experiencing growth in the coming years due to the increase in data needed to be stored at lower costs. Moreover, the company is putting efforts into expanding its distribution channels to capitalize on the growth prospects from the far-reaching international markets. In addition to availing cost benefits from the use of less expensive NAND flash memory, SanDisk's bottom line will also benefit from the weak JPY in the coming periods. The company purchases NAND technology mainly from a supplier based in Japan. These factors point toward the upcoming growth in the company's top and bottom lines. The analysts are also optimistic for the future prospects of the company. Combining the upcoming improvement in the company's performance and position with an increase in cash returns to be made by the company to its shareholders this stock is a good buy with a handsome upside potential.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Gemstone Equity Research research analyst.

2223293,62493,2014-05-16T15:37:07-04:00,"The company is executing well - a strong Q1 2014 builds off a stellar 2013.The strategy to dominate the Enterprise Market is paying off with high margins and strong revenue growth.SanDisk's ""Target Financial Model"" significantly raises the bar for investor communication.","It will hardly be a surprise to SA readers of my previous post on SanDisk (SNDK) when I say that I was eagerly looking forward to their annual investor's day presentation. The day did not disappoint. Broadcast in HD video, the company featured CEO Sanjay Mehrotra and four of his senior-most lieutenants in four hours of presentations and an hour of Q&A with the assembled audience. It was an impressive ensemble performance that delivered a message that investors in the company, the industry, and indeed the other MIPO companies that compete with SanDisk will want to pay close attention to. This was indeed ""must-see"" (web) TV.For those of you who are just now considering an investment in SanDisk, the company is the only pure-play NAND provider, one of the six principal companies worldwide that market NAND ""flash"" memory. Through its joint venture with Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY), the two companies share R&D and manufacturing and in combination possess a formidable IP position in NAND technology. Despite SanDisk's relatively small wafer capacity (approximately 216k wafers per month rising to 233k per month this year) that ranks last in the industry, it has consistently outperformed its larger competitors in terms of gross margin, operating margin, and free cash flow as a percent of revenue. (This last year (2013) the numbers in those three areas were: 47%, 29%, and 28%, respectively.) To say they had a good year last year would be a grave understatement, so there was ample reason for the SanDisk executive management team to be in an expansive mood as they addressed the assembled investors.In past years, a blow-out performance like they had in 2013 would not have necessarily been any reason for investors to be optimistic about repeating the performance. After all, SanDisk had similar (excellent) years in 2010 and 2011 that were followed by a disastrous 2012, where industry over-supply and hiccups in their retail-heavy strategy lead to a big drop in revenues, profits, and cash flow. Last year saw the emergence of a new strategy that started bearing fruit, and it is to that strategy that we now turn to consider the company's prospects going forward. Fortunately for us, SanDisk did a great job of addressing this strategy in their presentations.Let's skip to the punch line: SanDisk is now a MARKETING company whose main focus is to offer high-value NAND SOLUTIONS for the ENTERPRISE MARKET. Sanjay Mehrotra's opening remarks made this point brilliantly, and Henri Richard (SVP, WW Commercial Sales & Support) really drove the point home. Folks familiar with SanDisk's history will immediately note the big difference in emphasis because their retail business line used to dominate the company in terms of revenue and profit. No longer. Retail going forward will be a declining share of SanDisk's future revenues and profits. Still important, of course, but the main opportunities for SanDisk are in the data center and with OEMs, where TAM (Total Addressable Market) is growing daily as new applications and new suppliers open up opportunities for the company.Let's take the last first. A new class of OEMs has arisen in China, and SanDisk grew revenue with them last year 7x over the previous year from $65m to $425m, with that result being fully 25% of 2013 embedded category product sales. 2014 promises to be even stronger. Embedded product is less profitable than the enterprise business, but given the growth, SanDisk has to be a player and they are. Now for the really exciting category, SSDs. SanDisk is now the #2 supplier in market share, growing their client SSD revenues 3x last year from $307m to $922m. Considering they just started offering SSDs in FY 2010, this is a remarkable performance. They are qualified in all of the top ten PC OEMs, and this business will continue to be on a strong growth trajectory as the SSD attach rate for notebooks rises from 15% to 39% in the business segment and 10% to 21% in the consumer segment over the next four years.But even better than these great numbers is the potential in the Enterprise. Why? Because profits are so much stronger in this segment than in any other. Revenue growth isn't bad either. Sales in 2013 were 2.5x the previous year, and at $267m for 2013 are projected to grow to $1B in 2016. The next year after that Mehrotra is projecting a #1 market share. Considering that SanDisk is the smallest of the NAND suppliers in production and is projecting bit grow below the rest of the industry, this is quite a claim. I think that they can achieve that goal and, even better, that they are significantly underestimating the size of the market they will dominate.Here's why. Bottom line, the use cases for NAND in the enterprise are growing rapidly, and the economics of these use cases, these applications if you will, offer the customer a slam dunk justification for the investment in NAND over HDD and DRAM. Currently, the estimates for Enterprise TAM are heavily influenced by an analyst community that has been slow to grasp the paradigmatic shift that is overturning (""disrupting"" in MBA speak) the conventional wisdom of the ""storage"" market. (Amazing, I know, but true.) John Scaramuzzo, SVP GM of Enterprise Storage Solutions, followed Richard at the Investor's meeting and offered compelling evidence that this is the case.His case in a nutshell:The particulars of the SanDisk brief are brilliantly addressed by Scaramuzzo, so I won't go into them here other than to highlight a couple of the use cases that they document with TCA and TCO metrics. The first is a ""virtual desktop consolidation"" example in which the decision metrics are faster IOPS (input/output operations per second) and $/transaction. The documented result of a conversion to NAND -- a 57% reduction in TCA for servers and DRAM in a 10k virtual machine deployment where NAND with SanDisk proprietary software replaces 50 physical servers and their embedded DRAM. Example #2, a database management system that requires 100TB of storage and greater than 150K IOPS where SSDs replace HDDs and the $ per IOPS drops from $1.98 to $.07 (this is not a misprint!). (I encourage interested investors to either read the slides or view his presentation.)The takeaway for investors from a financial perspective is clear. Enterprise Market revenue, which was in 2013 estimated to be $3.5B, is projected to grow to $8B by 2017, and SanDisk is positioned to gain the lion's share of this market as the #1 provider. A second takeaway is one that SanDisk didn't make explicitly, but I believe made implicitly in their 2013 Investor's Conference. TAM estimates, which they have based on industry analyst views, are too low -- way too low, and especially in enterprise solutions. SanDisk thinks that the majority of the HDD market and a good portion of the DRAM market will be in play by 2017, a number that they position as ""addressable."" How big is that number? Try $44B. This market, in which HDDs will be replaced by high performance SSDs, iNAND™, software and other embedded NAND product is SanDisk's sweet spot and any increase in TAM there will flow in great proportion to the company's bottom line.Personally, I believe they will be more right than the analysts for two reasons. First, in the enterprise market the innate conservatism of mainframe facility IT managers is being challenged by the new ""cloud"" economics. Once the word gets out on the compelling economic case for the ""flash-enabled enterprise,"" the NAND rush will begin. Current TAM data is just not modeling this behavior. Second, prices are not going to be declining so much, which means that more revenue and bottom line profit is going to be captured from the bit growth that the industry is producing. Quite simply, there is no reason for SanDisk to be offering product at 50% margins when 60% is attainable. Crazy, I know.New rule. There is no crying in Oligopoly*.While there is so much more in this day's content that is worth commenting on, I will close with Judy Bruner's (EVP, CFO and CAO) presentation. In this she not only concisely outlines the recent company performance in 2013, she also presents what she calls the ""Target Financial Model,"" which communicates with superb transparency and lucidity the metric standard to which SanDisk should be held to by its investors. (Micron's investors should be warned at this point that viewing of this material will lead to potentially fatal increases in blood pressure and/or severe depression…).This is the new TFM:Several items deserve our attention. Note that the revenue growth is very conservative, ranging from 10%-15% in the years 2015 and beyond. This, I believe, is a direct expression of SanDisk's desire to be as transparent as possible while leaving them plenty of upside. UPOD. The same is true in the GM area, where they have raised their guidance from 47%-49% to 45%-51%.Of much bigger import is the increase in sales and marketing expense from 5% to 6%. This is very good news indeed, because it means that they are taking marketing seriously. This is where slideware becomes reality. The second major takeaway is CAP-EX, which is climbing from 14% last year to 30% a year going forward. No surprises here. Sanjay Mehrotra and his counterparts at the other suppliers have been talking about the tech node transitions becoming more and more expensive as time goes on, and the Target Financial Model now reflects that reality. Operating margin and free cash flow remain steady over the forecasting period at very good levels.This TFM, if executed, will result in SanDisk being a $10.3B/year business with more than $3B of operating margin over the next four years. All good -- excellent in fact -- but I'm not buying it. They are going to beat these numbers going forward, surprising and delighting customers and investors along the way.One element of caution regarding SanDisk requires watching, and that is the reaction of OEMs, some of them very large (e.g., IBM (NYSE:IBM)), who are highly motivated to succeed in this Enterprise environment. While my personal view is that the logic of vertical integration makes the economics difficult for solution providers other than NAND manufacturers, the very fact that this market is relatively insensitive to NAND pricing per se means that there will be something of an umbrella effect that will allow a motivated OEM to survive and perhaps even prosper, especially with a name that is practically synonymous with the Enterprise like IBM. Add HP (NYSE:HPQ), Dell, EMC (EMC), and a host of smaller players, and we're going to see quite a free-for-all in this space over the next few years.In conclusion: SanDisk has the strategy, the executive leadership, and the moment. The last element we have not talked about, but it remains the strategic lever on which all else depends. Consolidation has occurred in the industry. At long last, irresponsible state-financed capital is no longer funding competitors. Moore's law is slowing down; the barriers to entry in the industry are large and getting larger as tech node transitions become more capital intensive and time-consuming. Memory that used to be considered a commodity is now extensively customized, specialized for the application, and tailored to individual customer's engineering requirements. Overall NAND demand is surging and supply growth is constrained. Pricing leverage is tending to favor the suppliers. In this favorable environment, many strategies can produce good profits for member firms. One company, however, has the best plan to serve up high margin NAND product and delight the customer at the same time by delivering compelling value and quantifiable bottom-line solutions, and that is SanDisk.So when you read the next analyst claiming that a new fab will inevitably change the competitive environment in the semi-conductor memory space and that the bad old days of over-supply are just around the corner, ask yourself the following questions:If the answer to any of those questions is no, then take a deep breath and remember: there is no crying in oligopoly.* Long the industry; long SanDisk, long Micron.Notes:* If you are a supplier!* All statistics in this article based on SanDisk slides, which reference both SanDisk and industry analyst data.Disclosure: I am long SNDK.

(NASDAQ:WDC), a leading electronic storage provider, posted solid fiscal third-quarter results that were boosted by sales of its non-PC drives. While weakness in the PC segment and lower average selling prices weighed on results, sales of Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One, which include drives provided by WDC, helped the firm maintain roughly flat revenues relative to the year-ago period.Looking forward, fourth-quarter results are expected to be in line with the annual trend of slightly down revenues. Shareholders will benefit from the reduced share count. And most importantly, the company's strong product offerings and pipeline suggest that weakness in the PC market will be cushioned. Also, solid strategic acquisitions as a result of excellent cash management have left the firm on remarkable financial footing, relative to competitors.Based on the fundamentals of the firm, WDC is about 20% undervalued, but caution is warranted as broader market trends may extend the period of convergence to the intrinsic value.Recent DevelopmentsAnalyst's NoteWestern Digital Corp. is a global provider of products and services that empower people to create, manage, experience and preserve digital content. WDC designs and manufactures storage devices, networking equipment, and home entertainment products.WDC has a strong product pipeline, relative to Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), that consist of appealing, to enterprises and consumers, storage devices. The TCO advantages, provided by the company's helium-based drives, are appealing to enterprises. Also, relative to prior periods, the PC refresh cycle is considerably slower because of the introduction of smartphones, tablets, and cloud computing; consequently, while there may be near-term shifts in consumer preference of form factor, traditional compute will remain the dominate form factor for managing workflow.Fiscal third-quarter results were solid. Revenues are on track to coming in about $100-200 million below my full-year estimate of $15.2 billion. The profitability margins are roughly in line with my expectations. With that said, given all of the adjustments, the diluted EPS forecast increased from $6.26 to $6.89. The updated forecast is located in the above table.The liquidity remained ample, and the solvency position appears solid. There was a slight increase in leverage, which given the low interest rate environment is beneficial to equity investors because it lowers the total cost of capital. Looking forward, management will continue to invest in expanding plant capacity and in strategic acquisitions. Additionally, the growth of retained earnings and shareholders' equity over the past few years have been excellent.Cash flow provided by operations is tracking below my forecast. The difference is mostly attributable to less cash collected from accounts receivable. Last year, there was a $665 million decrease in accounts receivable, and this year there is a $12 million decrease. That's something that I will examine when fiscal fourth-quarter results are released. Capital expenditure is also running below my forecast. But share repurchases and dividend payments are tracking in line with my expectations.For the full year, PC unit shipments are expected to decline to 157 million from 162 million with non-PC units increasing by 6 million to 86 million. Also, the average selling price is expected to decline to $59. Total units are expected to be flat for the full year relative to the prior year. With that stated, WDC is expected to earn more than its cost of capital for the full year. Including the weakness in the PC market, I'm bullish on the fundamentals of the business. As an additional note, WDC appears to have extraordinary talent in the right positions.General RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in WDC.Portfolio & ValuationThe impulse wave of primary degree is going to give way to a corrective wave of primary degree. The bearish divergence of intermediate degree suggests the rally may be nearing an end. I'd watch for a flat corrective wave, which may have already started with the higher high in April being part of the correction.Based on the updated fundamentals, Western Digital is undervalued. The base case intrinsic value increased from $93.80 to $103.38 per share. The increase is attributable to the increased EPS forecast. Using my current estimate for 2015 earnings, the intrinsic value is about $100 per share. Consequently, this dip should be used to accumulate shares.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2249393,23479,2014-06-02T16:35:46-04:00,"Every year, the advancement of technology has led chip makers to accommodate more data on chips while simultaneously shrinking their  physical size.3-D technology stacks the chips vertically in an array, unlike planar NAND technology where the chips are arranged like a grid.The SanDisk-Toshiba chips will hit the market significantly later than competitors Samsung, Hynix and Micron because of the company's continued focus on small size chips and 2-D technology.","After Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) rolled out the first 3-D storage chips in 2013, storage chip manufacturers SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCF) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) (partnered with IBM) revealed their plans to develop and mass-produce their own 3-D chips. Last week, SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) announced their joint decision to produce 3-D chips on a mass scale. SanDisk has been focused on expanding its planar (or 2-D) technology with the launch of the new 15 nanometer chips in April. However, the constant reduction in process node sizes of conventional chips has made lithographic work more complex. Additionally, the gain in storage capacity doesn’t necessarily justify the massive cost involved in developing the technology, as smaller node sizes (<20 nanometers) begin to lose efficiency. 3-D NAND chips aim to combat these problems with vertically stacked chips rather than planar arrangement in conventional chips.Why 3-D?Every year, the advancement of technology has led chip makers to accommodate more data on chips while simultaneously shrinking their physical size. But reducing the size of process nodes further from the commonly used 20 or 19 nanometers to 10 nanometers has proved challenging and has affected the performance of these chips. Although the idea of 10 nanometer process nodes hasn’t been completely ousted, it is likely that different cell design methods gain popularity among manufacturers. In addition to becoming a very challenging task, the cost involved to further reduce the size of process nodes may outweigh the storage space/capacity gained.The 3-D card involves a new technology that aims to solve that problem; 3-D technology stacks the chips vertically in an array, unlike planar NAND technology where the chips are arranged like a grid. Moreover, 3-D chips do not require extremely precise lithography, which makes them cheaper to produce than advanced planar NAND chips. Samsung claims to produce V-NAND (or Vertical-NAND) chips which are 2-10 times more durable and reliable than planar NAND chips. Additionally, these chips provide twice the scalability of the current 20-nanometer planar NAND flash. Furthermore, Samsung’s 3-D solid state drives (SSD) consume 20% less power than planar multi-level cell NAND-based drives.Where SanDisk Stands On 3-DSanDisk and Toshiba entered into an agreement, where Toshiba will demolish its existing Fab 2 manufacturing plant in Japan and build a new wafer facility which will produce 3-D chips. The deal is reportedly worth 500 billion yen ($4.84 billion). Toshiba will cover the initial 40 billion yen ($390 million) in expenses of converting the existing facility into a new one and SanDisk will then later invest in the facility. The new facility is scheduled to be completed by 2015 and production could start by early 2016.The SanDisk-Toshiba chips will hit the market significantly later than competitors Samsung (2013), Hynix (early 2014) and Micron (2014). The main reason for this time lag is SanDisk’s continued focus on small size (<19 nanometer) chips and 2-D technology. Experts believe that it is not a question of if, but when the 3-D chips will replace the existing technology.The added durability, lower cost of production and increased scalability suggests that 3-D or vertically stacked chips could be the future of storage blocks, although it will be a few years before the technology becomes mainstream. Initially, the V-NAND offered by Samsung had nearly the same storage density as a corresponding conventional planar NAND. But with the increase in demand, the density gap has increased significantly. Samsung plans to invest a further $4 billion in its chip manufacturing division through March 2015, giving it a significant head start in this area.The mass production of 3-D chips could have long term benefits for SanDisk, as the demand for data is only going to continue to increase. With the kind of scalability offered by 3-D technology, it seems like it could ultimately replace the conventional planar technology. A possible downside for SanDisk could be if the 3-D chips produced by Samsung and Hynix gain popularity before SanDisk-Toshiba even begin production. Given the very limited market presence of 3-D chips right now, it's difficult to predict how soon the market adopts the new chips. However, in the long run, storage chip manufacturers are likely to rely heavily on vertical stacking.If 3-D chips gain traction from next year and become more widely adopted in internal storage of smartphones, wearable portable devices and laptops, it could lead to a reduction in SSD prices. If SSD prices fall to about 40 cents per GB, it could cut into SanDisk’s margins. We currently forecast SanDisk’s margins to remain flat over current values. A conservative reduction in gross margins by 2-3% in both the flash cards and enterprise storage division from 2014 through 2016 could lead to a 3% downside to our $86 price estimate for SanDisk.Disclosure: No positions Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

2271903,25120,2014-06-17T05:50:00-04:00,"SanDisk announces the acquisition of Fusion-io, boosting the presence in the attractive enterprise SSD market.The company is able to acquire the troubled Fusion-io at relatively attractive prices, with shares trading down 70% from their highs.I am cautious after its runaway momentum, despite the fair valuation, growth prospects and strong financial position.","SanDisk (SNDK) was one of the participants in this version of merger Monday, announcing the acquisition of Fusion-io, thereby boosting its presence in the enterprise SSD market.The strategic deal makes great sense, as SanDisk is able to buy the problematic company at a modest premium, with shares of Fusion-Io trading with losses greater than 70% from the highs set around $40 in 2011.Yet, after the runaway momentum, I am a bit cautious for SanDisk, despite a fair valuation, strong track record and solid financial position.The Deal HighlightsSanDisk announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Fusion-io (NYSE:FIO). The company will acquire the developer of flash-based PCIe hardware and software solutions which enhances the performance of applications in a $1.2 billion all-cash transaction.Net of cash held by Fusion-io, SanDisk will pay $1.1 billion for the company, or $11.25 per share in cash. The offer marks a 21% premium over Friday's closing price, and implies a premium of about $200 million in actual dollar terms.The deal has been approved by the board of directors of both companies, and is expected to close in the third quarter of SanDisk's fiscal year. The deal is expected to be accretive to non-GAAP earnings in the second half of 2015.Strategic RationaleWith the acquisition of Fusion-io, SanDisk is able to accelerate efforts to enable the flash-transformed data center, allowing companies to better manage their heavy data workloads at a lower total cost of ownership.The $1.1 billion deal can easily be paid out of SanDisk's comfortable cash balances. The transaction values Fusion-io at approximately 2.8 times trailing annual revenues of $387 million. Note that the company posted a $104 million loss over the past trailing year.Recent Investor DayBack in May, SanDisk held its investor presentation. Various secular trends are expected to drive the need for NAND flash in the future. Some of these supporting trends are buzzwords like Big Data, cloud computing, social networks, analytics, smart devices and Internet of Things, among others.The usage of NAND comes at a lower total cost of ownership, while it delivers instant and real-time results. It furthermore requires less power, cooling and space, while it is flexible to configure.Between 2013 and 2017, SanDisk anticipates the total addressable market for enterprise solid-state drives to increase by more than $5 billion to little over $8 billion.The total addressable market, including client SSDs, embedded and removables, is expected to grow by some $12 billion to $41 billion. This just shows that the vast majority of incremental growth is expected to occur in enterprise SSDs. It is exactly this market on which Fusion-io has focused itself.Valuing SanDiskSanDisk ended the first quarter with $2.81 billion in cash, equivalents and marketable securities. The company holds another $3.51 billion in long-term marketable securities, resulting in net ""cash"" holdings of $6.32 billion. The company has $2.01 billion in total convertible debt outstanding, resulting in a $4.31 billion net cash position.For the current year, SanDisk anticipates revenues to come in between $6.4 and $6.8 billion. Non-GAAP operating margins of 27% to 31% are similar to the 29% margins reported last year. Earnings are seen around $1.2 billion on a GAAP basis.Shares rose to levels above the $100 mark following the announcement of the acquisition, valuing SanDisk around $23 billion at $102 per share. This values operating assets at close to $19 billion, which values operating assets at 2.9 times annual revenues and 15-16 times annual earnings.SanDisk pays a quarterly dividend of $0.225 per share for an annual dividend yield of 0.9%.Momentum ContinuesOn the back of the announced deal, shares have risen another 3%, taking out new highs above the $100 mark. The reported $1.1 billion deal tag is very modest, representing roughly 5% of SanDisk's own market valuation, while the deal will add roughly 6% in annual revenues.On the back of this year's momentum and deals being announced in the industry, shares have risen sharply in recent times. So far in 2014, shares are up by 44%, after shares have risen about 73% compared to last year.The valuation at 15-16 times earnings seems fair given the rock-solid balance sheet, the overall high valuation of the stock market and the impressive track record over the past decade. Between 2004 and 2013, SanDisk has grown its revenues at an annual rate of roughly 15% per annum. Earnings have grown at pace as well, while total dilution of 20% over the entire time frame has been limited.The latest deal is of greater importance than simply adding some revenues. With Fusion-io, SanDisk gains a stronger foothold in data centers, the fast-growing segment of the market. These flash-memory based chips are faster and cheaper than conventional chips to be used by firms. The company will compete in the market with the likes of EMC Corp. (EMC) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), as well as new entrants, which could pressure margins in the future.Given the strong momentum, I am a bit cautious, despite an excellent deal, a strong track record, a fair valuation and a strong balance sheet. I will remain on the sidelines but reevaluate my stance on serious corrections.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2183973,23479,2014-05-01T17:24:02-04:00,,"Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) announced its Q3 FY 2014 earnings on April 30, reporting a mild 1.5% year-on-year decline in net revenues. The company’s gross margins increased by 44 basis points over the year ago quarter to 28.6%, driven by a 2% reduction in costs. Reported net revenues of $3.7 billion were in line with the company’s guidance, with margins and earnings per share exceeding guidance. Going forward, the company expects its revenues to be around $3.5 billion, which would be a 6% y-o-y decline. However, the company expects gross margins to improve slightly due to an improving product mix. We have a $94 price estimate for WDC’s stock, which is about 5% higher than the current market price.In line with our expectations, the company’s PC storage and branded product sales declined by about 4% each over the prior year quarter to about 38.4 million units and 6.2 million units, respectively. These declines were offset by a continued surge in consumer electronics unit shipments. Consumer electronics product sales grew by more than 30% year-on-year (y-o-y) to 8.5 million units during the quarter, with the growth mainly coming from storage drives used in gaming consoles. Contrary to our expectations, enterprise units sold by the company were flat over the previous year quarter at 7.1 million units – a disappointing result considering the more than 25% growth in numbers last year.Consumer Electronics Storage Drives Continue To SurgeWestern Digital has sold almost 17.4 million consumer electronics storage drives in the last two quarters combined. Comparatively, the company sold less than 13 million drives in the year ago period. The surge in these product sales was mainly driven by the recently launched fast-selling gaming consoles – Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Xbox One and the Sony (NYSE:SNE) PlayStation 4, which use 500 GB 2.5” form-factor storage disks. Both Microsoft and Sony refreshed their product lines with these new consoles after almost eight years, due to which the storage company faced strong demand for the storage drives integrated with the consoles. Going forward, the company expects consumer electronics storage product sales to remain high as it is likely that the Xbox One and the PS4 continue to sell strongly in the coming quarters, boosting WDC’s consumer electronics channel. Disappointing Numbers For Enterprise Storage And Branded Products Western Digital sold 24 million enterprise storage units in 2012, which grew to over 30 million units in the calendar year 2013. Moreover, the enterprise storage segment was boosted by $457 million of enterprise SSD sales in 2013, up from only $224 million in 2012. However, the company managed to sell only 7.1 million enterprise storage units in the quarter – a 1% decline compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the revenue generated by enterprise SSD sales sequentially declined for the first time in the last eight quarters. Although the enterprise SSD revenues grew by over 30% y-o-y to $134 million, they were flat if the contribution of the newly acquired sTec and Virident is excluded. Given the growing demand for enterprise SSD storage units, the company expects growth in enterprise units to pick up in the latter half of 2014.Western Digital witnessed strong demand for its My Cloud personal cloud range of drives during the quarter, which the company expects to continue in the long run (see WDC Launches Personal Cloud). However, the company’s revenues and units sold for the branded division as a whole were down year-over-year. The company attributed the decline in revenues to an increasing mix of cheaper 2.5″ drives compared to the 3.5″ drives, and lower unit sales with competitor Toshiba grabbing some market share. Unsurprisingly, Western Digital’s major competitor Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) also lost share to Toshiba this quarter, as pointed out by the latter’s management in its earnings call recently.Disclosure: No positions."
2152113,62493,2014-04-21T16:03:30-04:00,"SanDisk's premium pricing strategy is working - 51% gross margins will increase over the next few years.SanDisk's strategy and execution in the enterprise market promises to drive increased revenues, profits, and shareholder value.The Enterprise market for NAND is extremely undervalued by present industry models, and as TAM grows, SanDisk will capture the dominant share.","Sumit Sadana - SanDisk, Exec VP of R&D and Chief Strategy Officer, Investor Day 2013Since the dawn of the tech age, there has been one constant that industry execs and investors could rely on: namely, that no matter how big a market may be and how entrenched the current leaders are in that market, there is always the threat of an innovative competitor entering it with a new product that provides a compelling value equation that ""disrupts"" the current market, and over time changes the competitive landscape. Clayton Christensen is credited with coining the term ""disruptive innovation"" in 1995 for the general business market, but tech industry paragons such as Gordon Moore have used the term since the 60s. Since then, the term has been used, abused, and misused so much that smart investors should be wary when encountering it in a marketing presentation. All that said, when a credible source employs the term ""disruptive,"" it demands a closer look. SanDisk (SNDK) and its partner Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSYY), which owns much of the foundation IP in the NAND area, is one such credible source.So why would flash memory utilization in the enterprise qualify for this term? Consider the following two slides, presented last May at the SanDisk Investor Day by Tom Rampone, Sr. VP and GM of Storage Group: The first slide illustrates a use-case of a transaction-oriented DB of 3.1 TB that requires 81k transaction through-put. Note the dollar per transaction metric for three solutions to the same problem. As an IT executive, would you find the opportunity to reduce your TCO (Total Cost of Ownership) for this service by a factor of anywhere from 17 to 5 to 1 to be a compelling one? Of course you would. One further question, as you consider the payback from the SanDisk solution of a flash cache coupled with its proprietary ""Flash-Soft"" Software, would you be concerned about the relative price of the SanDisk NAND bits that are coupled as a part of the solution?Now, I'm going to make a rash assumption that you feel that the answer to the question is obvious. Especially when floor space and power consumption are enormous and increasingly costly aspects of your operations budget. When Sadana (see quote above) said ""the biggest disruptive force,"" he wasn't simply being dramatic. Think for a brief minute about the implications to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) of losing 15 - in the most extreme example - server seats! NAND in the enterprise is going to really shake up the industry, and IT managers are going to love every minute of it. Therein is the key to SanDisk's fabulous future: one that will see the company accelerate revenue growth, gross margin increases, and earnings and cash flow per share expansion through at least the balance of this decade. The second slide shows why.Note the ""$44B"" number represented as ""upside"" to the current TAM. $44B represents the TAM (Total Addressable Market) expansion for the three use-cases for which SanDisk has identified excellent Flash enabled solutions from its current estimate of $7.8B total enterprise TAM in 2016. ""Upside"" indeed! Getting excited? I hope so, because SanDisk is executing superbly on the ""premium pricing, high value-add"" strategy it laid out in 2013, the fruits of which we have just seen announced in it Q1 2014 earning conference call. This strategy depends almost exclusively on SanDisk winning in the enterprise market. This quarter's results show us that the strategy is paying off. What does SanDisk CEO Sanjay Mehrotra have to say about it?- Seeking Alpha transcript, SanDisk Q1 earnings conference call - Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO SanDiskI won't dwell on the excellent Q1 results, which have been amply covered in other articles. What's really important about this strong Q1 (a seasonally weak quarter!) are two things. The first is growth in the enterprise, including corporate and ""hyperscale"" (think Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or FaceBook (NASDAQ:FB)).- Seeking Alpha transcript, SanDisk Q1 earnings conference call - Sanjay Mehrotra, CEO SanDiskThe second vital factor in SanDisk's growth is the discipline to pursue their production strategy with focus and rigor. Once again, let's hear from Mehrotra:Seeking Alpha transcript, SanDisk Q1 earnings conference callSound familiar? Production restraint among the four members of the industry oligopoly is a key aspect of their future success, and Mehrotra has been one of the chief disciples of this strategy. He has consistently voiced the intention of leading SanDisk to gains in revenue share outpacing gains in bit share, and he has been good to his word. Q1 revenue bits as reported in the conference call were up only 20% YOY. So what happened to costs and prices? Costs were down 23% YOY with prices down only 7%. That's a 16% swing for all you folks scoring this at home. The reason? A portfolio mix heavier on enterprise sales and lighter on custom embedded sales, which tend to be big OEM smartphone and tablet contracts (e.g., Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)) sold at lower ""quantity discount"" margins.The net result of these two factors results in a new equation for operating in the NAND business: USBODP = increasing EPS and industry revenue/profit share. What's USBODP, you ask? Try ""Under Supply (NASDAQ:BITS) and Over Deliver (profits)."" This strategy, when combined with a relentless focus on higher margin enterprise business, promises to produce results sure to please shareholders.Conclusion: SanDisk is executing on the strategy that its competitors are (mostly) just talking about. It benefits from a simpler business model that eschews DRAM to focus solely on NAND. This undoubtedly helps. Another aspect of its business model that works in its favor is its ""Fab"" light model, which concentrates on industry leading NAND IP along with sales/marketing and lets Toshiba handle the manufacturing. How good is SanDisk in IP? In 2013, it booked slightly over $400M in licensing sales to its Korean competitors SK Hynix (OTC:HXSCL) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF). (Micron (NASDAQ:MU) avoids paying this toll because of the joint venture with Intel, which has ownership of the Intel/SanDisk cross licensing agreement.)SanDisk, in my opinion, is the class act in the NAND business. From a quality of management perspective, the company stands alone. If you're really interested in this industry, please find the time to listen to the recent earnings calls of SanDisk and Micron. Do an A/B comparison and consider what you are hearing. One is crisp, detailed, sure-footed - in sum, confidence inspiring. The other - well, let's just say it's not any of that. I realize this is hardly an original thought if you have been tracking the commentary on this industry on Seeking Alpha, but it is worth emphasizing. (Do I like SanDisk as a stock better than Micron? In a word, NO. I own both and will continue to stay long. Just imagine how good Micron could be when its management matures to approach SanDisk's level. This is a topic that deserves more development, and I will return to it.) Meanwhile, take another look at SanDisk's earnings release and check out Rampone's Investor Day presentation on the impact of NAND in the data center. You'll be very impressed by both, and understand why SanDisk is likely to continue to outperform.Disclosure: I am long SNDK, MU. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Here's what investors expect from Western Digital on Wednesday.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see Estimates and Interactive Features for Western Digital)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Western Digital to report $1.88 EPS and $3.731B revenue while the current Estimize.com consensus from 11 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is $1.96 EPS and $3.771B in revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting Western Digital to beat Wall Street's expectations by a considerable margin on both EPS and revenue.Over the past six quarters, the consensus from Estimize.com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Western Digital's EPS and revenue in every single quarter. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students and non-professional investors, Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69.5% of the time, but more importantly, it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case, we are seeing a moderate to large differential between the two groups' expectations on Western Digital's earnings.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from $1.87 to $2.17 EPS and from $3.736B to $3.850B in revenues. This quarter we're seeing a wide range of estimates on Western Digital's EPS and moderate range of revenue predictions.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A wider distribution of estimates signals less agreement in the market, which could mean greater volatility post earnings.This quarter, the Wall Street EPS consensus slipped from $1.89 to $1.88 while the Estimize consensus fell from a high of $2.02 to $1.96. Meanwhile, Wall Street raised its revenue consensus from $3.695B to $3.731B while the Estimize consensus also increased from $3.762 to $3.771B. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and upward analyst revenue revisions going into an earnings report are often a bullish indicator. Here the Wall Street consensus was flat going into the report while we saw slightly rising analyst revenue expectations from the Estimize community alongside a slightly declining EPS consensus.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is turbinecity who projects $1.92 EPS and $3.747B in revenue. turbinecity was our Winter 2014 season winner and is ranked 3rd overall among over 4,300 contributing analysts. Over the past 2 years, turbinecity has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 59% and 54% of the time, respectively, throughout over 2,000 estimates. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research, which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case, turbinecity is making a bullish call expecting Western Digital to beat even the Estimize community's expectations on both EPS and revenue.Western Digital's stock has pretty much just been on a straight climb up over the past couple of years, as it has outperformed expectations from both Wall Street and the buy side for 8 quarters in a row. Revenue and earnings have both been quite flat over the past few quarters and EPS and revenue are expected to come in slightly below last year's numbers on Wednesday. But the buy side as represented by the Estimize.com community still expects Western Digital to beat the Wall Street consensus by 8 cents per share in EPS and $40 million in sales.Disclosure: None."
2173743,23479,2014-04-29T15:34:03-04:00,,"Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) is scheduled to announce its Q3 FY 2014 earnings on April 30. The hard disk manufacturer witnessed 4% year-over-year (y-o-y) growth in its revenues in the second fiscal quarter due to increased product sales of its enterprise and consumer electronic units. Non-PC hard disk units shipped by the company increased by 17% y-o-y during the last quarter due to a 36% increase in consumer electronics units and a 17% increase in enterprise units. [1]The company’s gross margins improved by over a percentage point to 28.7% compared to the prior year quarter due the high profitability of enterprise storage units. [2] Going forward, the company has given a full year gross margin guidance range of around 27%-32%. Management mentioned that it is witnessing some seasonality in its quarterly results, which had been somewhat masked previously due to events in the past few years such as the Thailand floods and the Japan earthquake, which affected the company’s manufacturing and sales. For the March quarter, the company expects net revenues to sequentially decline by about 7% to $3.7 billion. However, margins could improve with the growing demand for enterprise storage products and solid state drives (SSDs).We have a $93 price estimate for WDC’s stock, which is about 5% higher than the current market price.Consumer Electronics Could Counter SeasonalityWestern Digital typically sells fewer consumer electronics products in the December and March quarters. Although more customers prefer the holiday season (the December quarter) for buying in the U.S. and Europe, more than 55% of the revenues are generated by sales in Asia-Pacific, where consumer trends are different. Contrary to this seasonal trend, Western Digital witnessed a surge in sales in the consumer electronics segment in the last quarter, which it partially attributed to recently launched fast-selling gaming consoles by Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Sony, which use 500 GB 2.5” form-factor storage disks. [3] Since Microsoft and Sony refreshed their product lines with these new consoles after 7-8 years, it is likely that the Xbox One and the PS4 continue to sell strongly in the coming quarters, boosting WDC’s consumer electronics channel.The company also witnessed strong demand for its My Cloud personal cloud range of drives. Although sales of these drives are likely to be seasonally lower than the previous quarter, the strong customer response for the personal cloud could be a strong positive in the long run (see WDC Launches Personal Cloud).Enterprise Storage To Continue GrowthWestern Digital sold 24 million enterprise storage units in 2012, which grew to over 30 million units in the calendar year 2013. Moreover, the enterprise storage unit was boosted by $457 million of enterprise SSD sales in 2013, up from only $224 million in 2012. Given the growing demand for enterprise SSD storage units, we expect the surge in enterprise units to continue in 2014, albeit at a slower rate than the 2013 run rate. The increasing mix of high-margin SSDs in enterprise storage is also likely to help the company further improve its margins.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

2188643,48501,2014-05-03T03:33:24-04:00,"First-quarter revenues came in below my forecast, but the EPS outlook is better-than-expected.The intrinsic value estimate is $81 per share.The shares are in a bull market of intermediate and primary degree.","SanDisk Corporation (SNDK), the flash memory manufacturer, reported solid first-quarter earnings. The results came in below my forecast on soft gigabyte prices. The company's solid-state drive segment reported excellent results, which is at least partly attributable to the strong product pipeline. Looking forward, the company could report revenue growth of about 10% for the full year, but EPS growth should be stellar on the impact of share repurchases.The company should report solid results from its SSD and embedded segments during the fiscal year, but the removable segment could weigh on the results of operations. Removable is less attractive to consumers in the age of cloud stage. Falling ASPs are a key risk to the outlook for the calendar year.For now, shares of SanDisk are overvalued as strong financial performance, an excellent product pipeline, and share repurchases have driven shares above their intrinsic value ($81).Recent DevelopmentsAnalyst's NoteSanDisk Corporation is a global leader in flash storage solutions. SNDK sells chips to device makers of smartphones, cameras, and other mobile devices. Also, SNDK is increasingly using NAND chips in its own branded solid-state drives, which are sold directly to companies and consumers. While they remain significantly more expensive than mechanical hard drives, SSDs are gaining popularity in data centers and consumer laptops because of their increased efficiency.Thinking about the business and industry, it is getting cheaper for SanDisk to produce, which is attributable to economies of scale and favorable currency movements. During 2013, there were circumstances that helped firm prices during the year, but generally it appears supply and commoditization are outstripping demand with the consequence of reduced ASPs. Lastly, growth in SSD solutions could be masking weakness in removable. (When was the last time that you purchased removable memory?) While the scale of my survey was limited, I think the results are indicative of reality; removable has a place but embedded and SSD are SNDK's future. A non-attributed quote referring to removable memory, ""That's old school; cloud storage….""Revenues are forecasted to come in below my original estimate as the ASP/gigabyte decline partially offsets gigabytes growth. My initial forecast was for 16.7% revenue growth to $7 billion, but I am lowering my estimate to 11% revenue growth or $6.85 billion. Readers should note that the industry is prone to sharp declines in ASP/gigabyte, and consequently the revenue forecast could be revised lower. The profitability profile for 2014 is better than I originally expected and the share count lower, and thus my diluted EPS forecast now calls for 43% growth to $6.20. Above is the table with the revised estimates. Additionally, the core-operating margin is trending higher.There was a decline in liquidity during the first quarter, as $840 million of convertible debt became current. But the liquidity appears ample, and the solvency position seems solid. There could be an increase in debt of $160 million or more during the calendar year. Also, accounts receivable has picked up substantially since the recession with the recent pace of increase slowing. After years of allowing relative fixed capital to decline, management has recently emphasized fixed capital investment, which could be a positive sign. Lastly, management hasn't been ""active"" on the acquisition front; this could be an area that is utilized later if organic growth begins to falter. Overall, the balance sheet looks solid, but I question the ROI of the long-term marketable securities relative to alternative options.Cash flow from operations is running below my forecast of $2.06 billion. There was a decrease in the non-cash charges during the first quarter, but most of the difference between my forecast and the run rate is attributable to changes in working capital. So I'll see how that plays out before I adjust my forecast. The latest expectation is $2.06 billion of free cash flow to equity for the full year.Including the updated operating and financial intelligence, SNDK is expected to generate a net operating profit that is greater than its cost of capital in 2014. The key risk to the outlook for this year is the price of memory.General RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in SanDisk.Valuation and PortfolioSNDK is in a bull market of intermediate and primary degree. The health of the primary trend appears to be excellent. Consequently, while the trend may appear to be long-in-the-tooth, it seems likely to continue.Based on the fundamentals of the firm, the base case intrinsic value of SNDK shares is $81.28, which means that the shares are currently overvalued. The absolute values of the forward multiplier valuations aren't pricey (13 times earnings), but there is the risk that the fundamentals of the firm are peaking. Additionally, the memory device supplier is trading at an EV-to-2014-NI (net income) of 13.50.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2143393,23479,2014-04-15T17:10:38-04:00,,"SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) is scheduled to announce its Q1 2014 earnings on April 16. In the last quarter, the company met its guided revenue midpoint of $1.73 billion, and we expect the company to stay within its expected revenue range of $1.425-$1.5 billion in Q1. The company posted healthier margins and a higher net income in 2013 compared to 2012, primarily due to a better mix of high-margin enterprise-class solid-state drives (SSDs) over embedded and client SSDs. Looking ahead, the company expects gross margins to be around 48% for the quarter while it expects gross margins for the full year to be similar to last year’s at around 45%. A weak Yen during the previous quarter resulted in a 6% reduction in production costs, since the company sources many products from Japan. The company could witness further benefits in Q1, as exchange rates have been lower than the company’s anticipated figures.Enterprise-Class Solid State Drives To Continue To Drive PerformanceSanDisk generated more than 20% of its revenues from enterprise SSDs in Q4. Comparatively, the contribution of these high-margin SSDs was less than 10% in Q4 2012. With user data increasingly moving to the cloud, storage demand from data centers is increasing. Since SSDs provide efficient storage through higher Input/Output per Second (IOPS) and low latency, they are increasingly becoming the preferred option for enterprises.Over the next few quarters, the company expects the contribution of SSDs to go up to around a quarter of its net revenues due to the expected growth in enterprise storage demand and its new products. If the company meets its expected target, it would provide a substantial boost to earnings, which we have incorporated in our current model. Although the company could face stiff competition from major storage providers such as Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) entering the enterprise SSD market, we expect the company to continue its strong growth in the enterprise-SSD arena.Virtualization Of Flash And The Future Of Software-Defined StorageSanDisk upgraded its Flashsoft software in the last quarter with the intention of targeting the growing demand for software-defined storage. The software for enterprise storage solutions uses host-based caching for VMware’s (NYSE:VMW) vSphere environments. This means that Flashsoft software enables a standard SSD to be used as a high-speed caching memory for enterprise-level storage devices. The memory drive acting as cache increases its IOPS, which improves performance and reduces latency. With such flexibility, SanDisk aims to capture the attention of IT departments that are contemplating the switch to flash arrays. Although flash arrays are gaining traction in the industry, switching to arrays is still costly. However, this is a new market for SanDisk and we expect long-term growth to come from software-defined storage.The Yen FactorAccording to SanDisk’s management, the low cost of sales in 2013 was primarily driven by the declining yen as the company sources many products from Japan. Moreover, management expects the yen devaluation to give a slight boost to bottom line figures in the next quarter as well. However, due to the unpredictable nature of the conversion rate, the company has hedged approximately one-third of its Yen exposure.We have a $75 price estimate for SanDisk’s stock, which is in line with the current market price.Disclosure: No positions"

Portfolio123 has a powerful ranking system which allows the user to create complex formulas according to many different criteria. They also have highly useful several groups of pre-built ranking systems, I used one of them the ""Balanced4"" in this article.The ""Balanced4"" ranking system is quite complex, and it is taking into account many factors like; EPS consistency, technical analysis, valuation, profitability ratios and dividend information, as shown in the Portfolio123's chart below.In order to find out how such a ranking formula would have performed during the last 15 years, I ran a back-test, which is available by the Portfolio123's screener. For the back-test, I took all the 7,014 stocks in the Portfolio123's database.The back-test results are shown in the chart below. For the back-test, I divided the 7,014 companies into fifty groups according to their ranking. The chart clearly shows that the average annual return has a very significant positive correlation to the ""Balanced4"" rank. The highest ranked group with the ranking score of 98-100, which is shown by the dark blue column in the chart, has given by far the best return, an average annual return of about 23%, while the average annual return of the S&P 500 index during the same period was about 2.5% (the red column at the left part of the chart). Also, the second and the third group (scored: 96-98 and 94-96) have given superior returns. This brings me to the conclusion that the ranking system is very useful.After running the ""Balanced4"" ranking system on all the S&P 500 tech stocks which pay a dividend with a higher than 1% yield, on April 18, I discovered the twenty best dividend stocks, which are shown in the chart below. In this article, I analyze the first stock of the list SanDisk Corp. (SNDK).SanDiskAfter beating analysts' expectations in its first-quarter 2014 earnings report, SanDisk's stock surged 9.41% on April 17, the day after the announcement. Nevertheless, in my opinion, SanDisk's stock is still a long-term investment opportunity right now. My favorite sectors for my own investments are the basic materials and the tech sector, perhaps because I find it more appealing to research companies from these sectors. I am always looking for a combination of value and growth stocks, and if the company also pays a dividend it is even better, one such a company is SanDisk.SanDisk Corporation is a global leader in flash memory storage solutions with a strong history of innovation that has been successfully commercialized. Flash storage technology allows digital information to be stored in a durable, compact format that retains the data even after the power has been switched off. The company is also a major supplier of solid state drive, or SSD, solutions for client computing platforms and enterprise data centers, and removable and embedded memory products for mobile devices, cameras and other devices. SSD does much the same job functionally as a hard disk drive HDD, but instead of a magnetic coating on top of platters, the data is stored on interconnected flash memory chips that retain the data even when there's no power present.SanDisk announced its first-quarter earnings report on April 16, which beat EPS expectations by $0.18 (14.30%) and beat on revenues. The company delivered record first quarter results, driven by 61 percent growth in its SSD revenue and strong retail performance. First quarter revenue of $1.51 billion increased 13 percent on a year-over-year basis and decreased 12 percent sequentially. On a non-GAAP basis, first quarter net income was $330 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, compared to net income of $207 million, or $0.84 per diluted share, in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and net income of $390 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.Now let's look at the numbers, SanDisk has recorded strong revenue and EPS growth during the last five years. The average annual sales growth for the past five years was high at 13%, and the average annual EPS growth for the past five years was very high at 20%. According to Yahoo Finance, SanDisk's next financial year forward P/E is at 12.99, and the average annual earnings growth estimates for the next five years is at 12.50%, these give a low PEG ratio of 1.04. The PEG Ratio - price/earnings to growth ratio is a widely used indicator of a stock's potential value. It is favored by many investors over the P/E ratio because it also accounts for growth. A lower PEG means that the stock is more undervalued. Furthermore, SanDisk is generating a lot of cash; its ttm price to free cash flow of 12.08 is among the lowest of all S&P 500 tech stocks. Many investors prefer using free cash flow instead of net income to measure a company's financial performance because free cash flow is more difficult to manipulate. Free cash flow is the operating cash flow minus capital expenditure.The company continues to deliver large sums of cash back to shareholders. On July 31, 2013, SanDisk announced that it has expanded its capital return program with the initiation of a quarterly dividend and the authorization of $2.5 billion of additional stock repurchases. SanDisk has not paid dividends before, and although the forward annual dividend yield of 1.20% is modest, it represents only 10% of the company net earnings, allowing SanDisk enough cash to continue investing to increase the SSD product portfolio and strengthen enterprise go-to-market strategies.ConclusionSanDisk has recorded strong revenue and EPS growth, and it has compelling valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects. Furthermore, SanDisk returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback and by dividend payments. The company benefits from its leading position within the accelerating transition from hard disk drive to solid state drive. During the latest quarter, SanDisk continued to increase the revenue contribution from SSDs, which rose to around 28% of revenue. Most growth in SSD continues to come from enterprise SSD. CEO Mehrotra noted that enterprise storage solutions, including SSD, are expected to be SanDisk's fastest-growing category in 2014.All these factors lead me to the conclusion that SNDK stock is a smart long-term investment.Disclosure: I am long SNDK.

2148253,23479,2014-04-17T16:24:30-04:00,,"SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) announced its Q1 2014 earnings on April 16. The company generated net revenues of $1.51 billion on the back of strong enterprise and client solid state drive (SSD) sales, exceeding the upper end of its revenue guidance. Despite outperforming for the quarter, management expects the company to stay within its previously expected revenue range of $6.4-$6.8 billion for the full year. In line with our expectations, the company posted healthier margins in the quarter owing to a greater-than-anticipated mix of the more profitable enterprise-class SSDs. The growing mix of SSDs compared to embedded and removable flash storage in the last few quarters has resulted in consistent quarter-over-quarter margin improvement for the company. SanDisk’s non-GAAP margins for the quarter stood at an impressive 51% – over 10% higher than Q1 2013.Looking ahead, the company has given revised guidance for its gross margins in the 47%-49% range for the full year. The average Yen rate was in line with SanDisk’s expectations, at about 99 Yen per U.S. Dollar during the quarter. The company believes it could witness further benefits in production costs in Q2, since it expects the favorable Yen exchange rate to continue in the coming quarter. However, due to the unpredictable nature of the conversion rate, the company has hedged approximately one-third of its Yen exposure.We have a revised $77 price estimate for SanDisk’s stock, which is slightly higher than the current market price.Enterprise SSDs Drive Revenues, Improved MarginsSanDisk generated almost 20% of its net revenues from SSD sales in 2013, and had estimated that the revenue mix of SSDs would increase to around 25% in 2014. However, the mix of solid-state drives grew more than expected and generated around 28% of the company’s net revenues for the quarter. Over the next few quarters, we expect the contribution of SSDs to go stay in a similar range and have revised our forecast to reflect this. If the company meets its expected target, it would provide a boost to the company’s earnings, owing to the higher margins of SSD products.SanDisk attributed much of the growth in the SSD sales to its software-as-a-service ((SaaS)) portfolio. SanDisk upgraded its FlashSoft software in the last quarter to cater to the growing demand for software-defined storage. The software for enterprise storage solutions uses host-based caching for VMware’s (NYSE:VMW) vSphere environments, meaning that FlashSoft software enables a standard SSD to be used as high-speed caching memory for enterprise-level storage devices. The memory drive acting as cache increases its IOPS, which improves performance and reduces latency. Going forward, enterprise customers are likely to increase the adoption of the FlashSoft software layer, which should continue to drive SanDisk’s enterprise-class SSD revenues.Margins To Decline Slightly As The Year ProgressesGoing forward, the company expects the product mix of embedded storage products to gradually pick up in the coming quarters. The company expects the demand for embedded products, which include storage attached host system boards in portable devices such as smartphones and tablets, to increase in the latter half of the year as the iNAND solutions have just begun to gain momentum. However, management stated that the company has seen higher demand for custom embedded solutions compared to its multi-chip package (MCP) iNAND – which could bring down overall margins for the company, since customized embedded solutions have comparatively lower margins. The growth in sales of custom embedded solutions could slightly offset the margin improvement as a result of high SSD sales, due to which the company estimates that its overall gross margins could sequentially drop in the latter half of 2014 to bring the annual average to about 47%-49%.Disclosure: No positions"

As a result, Enterprising Investors following the ModernGraham approach based on Benjamin Graham's methods should feel comfortable proceeding with further research into the company. As for a valuation, the company appears to be significantly undervalued despite the recent rise in the market price. The company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $3.75 in 2010 to an estimated $5.79 for 2014, a level of demonstrated growth that surpasses the market's implied estimate of 3.46% earnings growth. This leads the ModernGraham valuation model to return an estimate of intrinsic value that is well above a margin of safety relative to the current price.Disclaimer: The author did not hold a position in Western Digital Corp. or any of the other companies listed in this article at the time of publication and had no intention of changing that position within the next 72 hours."
2105823,54222,2014-03-24T14:08:04-04:00,Western Digital is performing better than Seagate with solid earnings growth and market share gains.Western Digital’s acquisitions look promising and should deliver long-term value.Rapid growth in SSDs and enterprise storage are catalysts for Western Digital.,"It looks like Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is stealing a march on its arch-enemy Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX). The first evidence of this fact can be seen in the share price performance of the two companies. While Seagate is down more than 10% this year, Western Digital has inched up slightly to the tune of 2.62%. Even the recent results of both companies show that Western Digital is performing better than Seagate, which is why it could be a better choice for investors in the long run.Western Digital: Outperforming Seagate and moreWestern Digital's quarterly profit rose 28% year-over-year and beat Wall Street estimates, driven by sales of higher-margin data storage products to enterprise customers and gaming console makers. Comparatively, Seagate's performance in the previous quarter was nothing to write home about as the company's revenue fell almost 4% year-over-year while earnings dropped 13%.Moreover, Western Digital is quite positive about its unique position in the storage ecosystem, enabling a broad-based perspective on several changes that are underway. It serves very large markets followed by strong data growth prospects. Strategically, it is very well positioned to play a leadership role by innovating and collaborating with its customers to define the future digital data landscape. Also, the total addressable market for Western Digital seems to be growing, driven by seasonal demand on the back of strength in gaming and branded products.But then, Western Digital had to cut its revenue outlook for the first quarter. Management said that the industry's total addressable market for hard drives in the ongoing quarter was lower than expected as a result of weak demand and inventory rebalancing.Long-term movesWestern Digital has made some impressive moves of late that should help it profit in the long run. The $3.4 billion acquisition of Hitachi's hard-disk-drive operations has benefited WDC. The company also recovered healthily from suspended operations in Thailand due to flooding that damaged its facilities. Western Digital has been bringing more production back online. In addition, its supply partners and strategic customers have enabled Western Digital to make substantial progress in partially restoring its operations in Thailand.Western Digital also announced the completion of the acquisition of Virident Systems, a provider of server-side flash storage for virtualization, database, cloud computing and webscale applications. Virident will be integrated into HGST, a wholly owned subsidiary of Western Digital. The acquisition is based on HGST's strategy to address the rapidly changing needs of enterprise customers by delivering intelligent storage solutions that maximize application performance by leveraging the tightly coupled server, storage and network resources of converged datacenter infrastructures.Moreover, Western Digital has also completed the acquisition of sTec, an early innovator in enterprise solid-state drives ((SSDs)). sTec will also be integrated into HGST, a wholly owned subsidiary of Western Digital, and should help the company profit from the growing adoption of solid state drives.Western Digital continues to see robust growth due to storage demand. The company saw volume increases in both PC and non-PC businesses on a year-over-year basis. Western Digital ended up shipping a total of 60.2 million hard drives in the previous quarter, a solid jump over the 44.2 million units it moved in the year-ago quarter.The increase in demand for high definition (HD) content, such as HD DVD and Blu-Ray, should drive demand for high capacity disk-drive solutions. As more consumers are turning to external drives to increase their existing storage capacities to create and share HD content, Western Digital should see a boost in its addressable market.ConclusionIt is quite evident that Western Digital is a better pick than Seagate in the storage space. The company reported solid earnings growth in the previous quarter as we saw above, and this makes it a steal at just 20 times trailing earnings. The continued growth in data storage and key acquisitions should enable Western Digital to perform well in the future, making it an intriguing investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2099133,48501,2014-03-20T03:29:39-04:00,The estimated intrinsic value is $93.80 per share.WDC has a strong product pipeline.The technicals remain long-term bullish.,"Shares of Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC), the electronic data storage device manufacturer, declined moderately following fiscal second quarter results that beat expectations but third-quarter guidance that disappointed investors.Despite the relatively weak guidance, WDC remains well positioned in the electronic data storage industry following substantial investments in SSDs. Also, the firm's product pipeline is amongst the best in the industry with the My Cloud EX2, Touro S mobile, Ultrastar C15K600, Ultrastar He6, and WD Black. But the firm lacks an embedded solution for mobile devices. That said, WDC is expected to gain share in enterprise SSD and maintain a substantial share of the HDD market.Considered in aggregate, the outlook for WDC is bullish and there is substantial confidence in the near $94 per share intrinsic value estimate.Recent DevelopmentsBusiness SummaryWestern Digital Corp. is a global provider of products and services that empower people to create, manage, experience and preserve digital content. WDC designs and manufactures storage devices, networking equipment, and home entertainment products.According to data from IDC and WDC, Exabytes are expected to grow at a CAGR of 34% through 2020. Consequently, WDC's industry has a tailwind with WDC well positioned in personal storage, client, and enterprise systems.For 2014, I expect revenue to be roughly flat as the PC market continues to adversely impact performance. The improvement in operating income and net income during the year emanates from a $681M charge during fiscal 2013. For fiscal 2015, I expect revenue to increase 5% as conditions in the PC market improve on enhanced PC product offerings and increased sales of SSDs. Also, WDC's and HGST's products pipelines are amongst the best in the industry, which should positively impact financial performance.This graphic shows the SDD market growing at an 18.75% CAGR through 2017. That will obviously have a positive impact on WDC's financial performance. Most of the impact will be in fiscal 2016-2018.Management decreased the level of cash from excessive to ample, in my opinion. Also, the leadership of the firm decided to increase the use of financial leverage to about 20% of total capital. Management could increase financial leverage, if necessary.Cash flow from operating activities is forecasted to be roughly flat this year, for the third consecutive year. But CFO is expected to increase to almost $3.6B in fiscal 2015. Free cash flow is expected to increase substantially in fiscal 2015. Also, cash returned to shareholders could exceed $1B this year before reaching $1.4B in fiscal 2015.WDC started investing in SDD in 2008 and those investments should start to pay material dividends in the coming years. The company has made several key acquisitions in the enterprise SDD space, which gives WDC a leg up on some of its competitors. Also, if Chinese regulators clear the completion of the HGST deal, investors will benefit from the synergies. The aforementioned is in combination with what I consider to be one of the best product pipelines in the industry. The outlook for WDC is favorable throughout the rest of fiscal 2014 and through 2015.Portfolio & ValuationWDC is in a bear market of intermediate degree and a bull market of primary degree. The share price is expected to continue to consolidate through the rest of the first quarter and through at least part of the second quarter.A fundamentals-based capitalized cash flows model was used to derive the intrinsic value of WDC. Based on the base case inputs, the intrinsic value is 9.5% above the current share price. The model is based on fiscal 2014 inputs. At the base case intrinsic value, WDC would be trading at 15 times fiscal-2014 earnings.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2096763,56202,2014-03-19T03:30:40-04:00,"Seagate’s revenue and earnings are declining, but Western Digital posted robust growth in the previous quarter.Weakness in the cloud business is not a good sign for Seagate.A head-to-head comparison between Seagate and Western Digital shows the latter to be a better investment option.","Storage company Seagate Technology's (NASDAQ:STX) shares have fallen from grace after a terrific run in 2013. As sales of PCs slow down and competition from Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) rises, Seagate is having a tough time impressing investors. Its revenue is declining and earnings are also moving south now. Hence, should investors consider dumping Seagate and look at a better option such as Western Digital? Let's check.Weakness in the businessSeagate's growth in the cloud storage business is slowing down, and this was the reason behind the company's weak performance. Seagate is also seeing an increase in expenses in areas such as products for mobile devices and servers, plus declining sales of personal computers that use its products are another headwind.However, Seagate is strategically investing in its product portfolio and enhance its vertically-integrated manufacturing capabilities to effectively capitalize on the cloud, mobile, and open source storage trends that are being fueled by data growth. Strong cash flow, combined with the execution of capital allocation strategy, reflects that Seagate is on the right track of its goal of returning 70% of its operating cash flow to shareholders this fiscal year.But then, the fall in sales of personal computers has negatively affected the revenue of Seagate. Global PC shipments fell 10% last year. A shift in consumer focus from personal computers to smartphones and hand held devices has resulted in huge losses for Seagate. However, the company's management states that Seagate has benefited as people buy portable disk drives to back up data stored on tablets and smartphones. Hence, it is advisable for investors to think twice before investing in the stock.Looking ahead, Seagate is planning to buy fellow data-storage company Xyratex for about $374 million to expand its business in enterprise data storage systems. The acquisition is expected to add between $500 million and $600 million to Seagate's revenue in 2015. In addition, Seagate is tapping into the growing demand for products that help store data in the cloud and is reducing its dependence on personal computer hard drives as consumers shift to smartphones and tablets.Comparing with Western DigitalBut, investors should note that Seagate's rival Western Digital reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit, driven by sales of higher-margin data storage products. Seagate posted a 3% year-over-year decline in drive unit shipments to 56.6 million, or 40% of the addressable market. In comparison, Western Digital's revenue was up in the previous quarter on a year-over-year basis while earnings jumped an impressive 28%. Moreover, if we compare the stats of both companies, Western Digital comes out on top.Source: Yahoo! FinanceReferring to the above table, we come to a conclusion that Western Digital is pretty impressive on the charts. The company is posting growth on both revenue and earnings, and this could benefit investors in the long run.ConclusionSeagate is under pressure due to weakness in its cloud business and the slowdown in the PC market. Also, from an investment perspective, we see that it is not a better buy than Western Digital. So, investors should consider selling Seagate and instead invest in Western Digital.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2094183,48501,2014-03-18T03:45:16-04:00,The 16 times forward EPS value estimate is not taxing.The increasing demand for mobile and SSDs should act as a tailwind.The technicals are bullish and in a minor downtrend.,"SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) reported strong 2013 results that were driven by sales of its embedded and SSD offerings. Revenue increased 22% in 2013 and is forecasted to increase 13.5% in 2014. The cost structure continued to improve on technological advancements as well as operating expenditure discipline.Investors are likely to benefit from the firm's transition to 1Y and eventually to 1Z technology. Also, the increasing use of SSDs in client as well as server is likely to continue to act as a tailwind for SNDK. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) represents a substantial portion of SNDK's revenue and is likely to maintain a dominant position in mobile computing throughout 2014 and 2015. Consequently, the outlook for sales of iNAND (used in mobile devices) offerings is bullish.Management has done a fantastic job of improving the company's cost structure, which increased the value estimate. Also, strong growth from a change in consumer preferences adds to confidence in the intrinsic value estimate. Thus, it is likely that SNDK will reach the $81 per share, or 16 times forward EPS, intrinsic value estimate.Recent DevelopmentsBusiness SummarySanDisk Corporation is a global leader in flash storage solutions. SNDK sells chips to device makers of smartphones, cameras, and other mobile devices. Also, SNDK is increasingly using NAND chips in its own branded solid-state drives, which are sold directly to companies and consumers. While they remain significantly more expensive than mechanical hard drives, SSDs are gaining popularity in data centers and consumer laptops because of their increased efficiency.The NAND industry is fragmented with several companies offering similar products. Some of the competitors in the industry are larger and have greater resources than SNDK. Overall, suppliers of NAND have limited pricing power. Also, the threat of substitute products should weigh on profitability, as consumers utilize cloud-computing solutions, which sometimes replace the need for in-device memory. Lastly, the demand for data storage solutions is increasing as businesses and consumers store an increasing quantity of data electronically.After increasing 22% in 2013, revenue is forecasted to increase 13.5% in 2014 on strong demand for SSDs and embedded solutions. Profitability margins are forecasted to increase in the current calendar year on cost reductions and a contribution from higher margin retail products. Diluted EPS is forecasted to grow 16.6% on a reduction of diluted shares and increased net income.While cash flow from operations is expected to increase 12.7% in calendar 2014, free cash flow is forecasted to decline on higher capital expenditure. The decline of free cash flow will limit share repurchases during the calendar year, which are forecasted to decline. The dividend is forecasted to increase to $0.25 per share/quarter.The solvency position is solid and there was ample liquidity at the end of 2013. The effective cost of debt has been trending lower as SNDK increased debt-to-capital. While the financial leverage ratio is forecasted to increase at the end of 2014, the solvency position is forecasted to remain solid.Embedded and SSD sales are expected to drive revenue growth in fiscal 2014. The expectation is for continued strength in client and enterprise SSD as well as continued demand for iNAND and iNAND MCP on increasing global mobile device sales. The industry growth rate should keep ASPs per gigabyte relatively firm during the calendar year. Consequently, flat to slightly down ASPs times increasing units equals higher revenue, and the improving consolidated cost structure means margin expansion with EPS growing faster than sales. Additionally, share repurchases should at least offset dilution resulting in a higher share price.RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in SanDisk.Portfolio & ValuationSNDK is in a bull market of primary and intermediate term degree. The shares are trading just off of the most recent high, which would be a dip to buy depending on the investment time horizon. Nonetheless, I expect traders to accumulate shares and SNDK to push towards $80 per share.An average measure of profitability was used to determine the base case intrinsic value. The optimistic valuation implies that the more recent profitability is sustainable, and the pessimistic valuation implies a return to lower levels of profitability. The forecast is for above-average growth and above-average risk. The base case value is an 11% premium to the current market price, which is not too demanding, based on the forward multiplier model valuations.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2106093,23479,2014-03-24T15:44:51-04:00,,"SanDisk Corporation (SNDK), widely recognized for its removable flash storage products, has switched its focus towards developing enterprise-class flash storage products. This comes as a result of increasing demand for solid-state flash-based storage solutions. According to our estimates, the company’s solid-state drive (SSD) division constitutes about 30% of the company’s valuation, primarily due to the high profitability of SSDs and the anticipated growth in the division.With software-defined storage beginning to gain traction, storage companies are developing their products so that they can be integrated on virtualization platforms. Major storage providers such as EMC (EMC) and NetApp (NASDAQ:NTAP) have introduced software layers on their flash arrays that not only enable the storage devices to be accessed via cloud, but also enable users to virtualize other storage systems. Despite high inputs/outputs per second (IOPS) storage solutions offered by storage providers in the market, users often face bottlenecks in the storage architecture that effectively reduce the read/write capabilities of high-end storage products or increase latency. In the last quarter, SanDisk rolled out an upgraded version of SanDisk Flashsoft, its software layer that intends to eliminate these storage bottlenecks and maximize utilization of software-defined storage.We have a $75 price estimate for SanDisk’s stock, which is in line with the current market price.On traditional virtualization platforms, a single physical server hosts various virtual machines (VMs) that share all hardware resources, including storage drives. The main disadvantage of using this approach becomes apparent when certain applications use up more resources than anticipated within the space of a common physical server. This hinders the performance of applications on other VMs connected to the same server. Although IT departments across companies try to ensure a fair distribution of resources according to applications, there can be unanticipated outliers or workload spikes that can disrupt high IOPS usage or increase latency. The bottlenecks caused by such disruptions can be countered with a flash hypervisor, or a software layer, that sits on top of the virtualization platform and redistributes flash resources to the VMs.Currently, the only way to obtain higher IOPS on traditional Storage-Attached Network (SAN) platforms is to add more hard drives to the existing storage racks to achieve the throughput levels. This makes virtualized flash especially beneficial for traditional data centers because it optimizes memory allocation and eliminates the need of investing on additional hardware. Although scaling up has becoming cheaper and easier with the introduction of all-flash arrays, investing in hardware is certainly more expensive than adding a software layer.SanDisk FlashsoftSanDisk Flashsoft, the software for enterprise storage solutions, uses host-based caching for VMware’s (NYSE:VMW) WvSphere environments. This means that Flashsoft software enables a standard SSD to be used as a high-speed caching memory for enterprise-level storage devices. The memory drive acting as cache increases its IOPS, which improves performance and reduces latency. With such flexibility, SanDisk aims to capture the attention of IT departments that are contemplating the switch to flash-arrays. Although flash-arrays are gaining traction in the industry, switching to arrays is still costly.If customers were to decide to switch from traditional storage platforms to a flash arrays, they would first back up all existing data and applications. They would then restore the data and reconfigure applications on the new platform. Additionally, it is unlikely that shifting to a newer platform would be a 100% shift at once. Therefore, during data migration there is effort involved in prioritizing the shift of applications/data to the faster platform and retaining less frequented data on the original platform. Customers can avoid all that effort if they use the Flashsoft software layer instead, where only a minimal initial configuration is required to get started. The company’s latest Flashsoft 3.2 is available for both Windows and Linux platforms.On the virtualization front, Flashsoft supports all VMware vSphere features, including vMotion, VMware High Availability (HA) and vSphere Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS). On the back end of storage, Flashsoft is compatible across all available data storage infrastructures irrespective of make (EMC, NetApp, Hitachi) or connectivity (SATA, SAS or PCIe). [1] Additionally, it supports all guest operating systems in the virtual machines, giving the software full flexibility. At the end of last year, SanDisk announced that VMware has certified its enterprise-class solid-state drives, which are available in Dell’s (NYSE:DELL) Poweredge servers, as a supported flash layer that can be used with VMware Virtual SAN. [2] According to Forrester Research, Flashsoft software would cost slightly over $130,000 (including software maintenance) over a three-year period, whereas IT costs can be reduced by up to $400,000 by deploying the software solution. [3]Although the solution offered by SanDisk provides an ease of usage and a cheaper alternative to flash arrays, it has certain disadvantages that may hamper its long term growth prospects. Firstly, the performance boosts offered by the Flashsoft software are only effective in reading data. The writing of data is predominantly associated with the back end (storage drive side of data centers), which is unlikely to be affected by a performance boost or optimization of memory allocation. [4] Secondly, using a simple SSD as cache memory reduces the read-time or latency of frequently accessed data, which gets moved to the cache memory for faster access. Therefore, there may not be a similar improvement in performance when dealing with infrequently accessed data. We believe it is likely that the adoption of Flashsoft software layer provides only a near-term benefit for SanDisk.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
2026541,56822,2014-02-17T17:03:24-05:00,,"SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) comes off as a not too prominent a name when we discuss Fortune 500 companies or those that have outperformed the S&P 500 index by a wide margin. The company averages $6.2 billion in annual sales from storage drives and is a good choice to include in one's portfolio due to the promising total return it offers as seen from its operational history and strategic choices. The stock trades at $72 and has appreciated more than 40% year to date.The QuarterSource: Earnings ReleaseBefore we discuss how solid state drives will lead the future let us have a look at what the company did in its last quarter. In the recent quarter that ended last month, SanDisk's revenue jumped 12% year-over-year to $1.73 billion owing to higher gigabytes sold (13%) in comparison to price decline (2%). The company has been able to snatch a greater market share in the retail arena that contributed toward its 18% year-over-year increase in retail revenue due to higher mobile cards (USB and SSD sales). Rapid innovation and delivery of products with faster transfer rates has enabled the retail segment maintain its 38% proportion of the company's total revenue.Commercial revenue has grown 8% year-over-year making up nearly a billion of the company's revenue. The year-over-year commercial growth was driven by a strong increase in Solid State Drive sales to both client and enterprises which was partially offset by a decline in mobile revenue. SSD accounts for the major sale component of the company and on an annual basis, has experienced a 170% increase since 2012.With regards to costs, it is wise to look at them from a sequential basis. This is because the technology industry is quickly evolving and once prices decline they tend to stay there. The company's gross margin increased 80 bps to 50.9% this quarter due to higher utilization of the company's X3 model, better currency translation and lower cost per GB (6%).Operating expenses were bombarded with increments such as higher R&D, $6 million seasonal expenses and bonuses paid that temporarily affected net income. At the end, diluted EPS increased 23% to $1.45 owing to higher revenue and partially benefiting from share repurchases that brought the denominator down.All in all, SanDisk's higher revenue and profit were justified by its increasing market share, declining costs of production owing to newer models being introduced, and better currency translation.The FutureSSDs will Continue Pushing Top Line GrowthSource: TrefisThe SSD industry is in an aggressive expansion mode fueled by lower prices, their increased usage in thin laptops and Ultrabooks as well as in enterprise storage systems. With regards to enterprise solutions though cloud storage that is on the rise today may negatively impact the demand for internal storage in the future it will be the most important factor in the growth of enterprise SSD sales. As more user data moves to cloud storage, servers will be needed to support the higher IOPS and thus will require more efficient storage than currently installed HDDs.SSDs are a substitute for the common hard drives that are presently used and are gaining momentum because they are portable and provide faster transfer rates. According to a market research firm, shipments of SSD rose 82% last year. On the other hand, the shipments of mechanical hard drives fell 5% with optical drive shipments shares falling by more than 12%.As more companies move toward Big Data and adopt solutions to extract meaningful value from it they will be in need of storage solutions that are capable of being fast enough to handle real time operations. Since disk based storage (HDD) possesses hardware limitations on speed chiefly due to physical disks rotating inside them SSDs will prove to be a more feasible option.SSDs are Too Costly Now but May Be More Affordable in the FutureSSDs are costly replacements for disk storage systems of enterprises at the moment but they are still presently being used to make arrays that form the Tier 0 (or cache) of enterprises storage systems. As more disk storage system vendors use flash based arrays for cache the demand for enterprise SSDs will increase in the future.This year it is predicted that the SSD market will grow by 50%. Within three years SSD shipments will top 190 million units. We can count on this to bring top line growth for SanDisk as it puts SSD as a top priority in its product portfolio and has invested heavily in its production.Beating the crowdIn 2013, SanDisk spent $1.6 billion in share repurchases and paid nearly $100 million as dividends. In total, the company's 2013 return of cash to investors was 98% of free cash flow. This is expected of a company that is able to generate revenue growth of 12.3% as its three-year average with a debt to equity of 0.1 surpassing the industry's revenue growth and D/E of 9% and 0.3, respectively.It would be fair to admit that SanDisk is exposed to risks that are inherent in the industry in which it operates. However, a glimpse of the strategy by the company such as its partnership with Toshiba for the construction of the phase two shell of the Fab 5 joint venture wafer fabrication facility that is expected to be completed by the middle of this year showcases how SanDisk plans to give the competition a hard time.Fab 5 possesses earthquake absorbing structures and is being designed to minimize environmental impacts that will prevent sensitive data loss and could become a part of a solid product for the company in the future. Innovations such as these and strong SSD demand make me sure of the future of the company. Therefore, I believe SanDisk is undervalued and presents itself as a good opportunity for investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2105433,57152,2014-03-24T11:58:15-04:00,A growth company is all set to achieve higher growth.Solid State Drive (SSD) continues to bring significant growth due to rising demand for mobile products.SSD will outperform HDD due to its higher performance and better data efficiency.Apple’s upcoming iPhone 6 may help the company to achieve higher growth.,"SanDisk (SNDK) designs, develops, and manufactures diversified data storage products using flash memory, controller, firmware, and software technologies. Its products include SSDs, embedded products, removable cards, universal serial bus (USB, drives), wireless media drives, digital media players, and wafers and components. Its embedded flash products are used in mobile phones, tablets, computing platforms, imaging devices, and many other products. In addition, its removable cards are used in a wide range of consumer electronics devices such as mobile phones, tablets, digital cameras, gaming devices and PCs.The company operates in an industry characterized by rapid technology transitions and evolving end-user markets for NAND flash. With the emergence of mobile products including smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices, company's sales of embedded and removable NAND flash solutions for the mobile market grew to represent the largest percentage of its revenue, and it continues to see growth in smartphone and tablet adoption as well as in the average capacity of its embedded and removable products used in these mobile products.Over the past two years the company has seen significant growth in its client SSD and enterprise SSD solutions and I believe that over the next few years the largest growth areas for NAND flash will be SSD solutions in the client computing and enterprise data center markets.Financial HighlightsSanDisk's success is mainly attributable to strong client and enterprise SSD sales, strength in retail businesses, and favorable supply demand metrics. This is the reason why the company's total revenues for fiscal year 2013 of $6.17 billion increased 22% from $5.05 billion in fiscal year 2012. The increase in fiscal year 2013's revenues reflected an increase in the number of gigabytes sold with no change in the average selling price per gigabyte.Source: Annual Report 2013A Y/Y 22% increase in commercial revenue was primarily related to increased sales of client and enterprise SSD products and embedded memory products for mobile devices. Similarly, a Y/Y 23% increase in retail revenue was primarily related to increased sales of cards for mobile devices, USB drives, and SSDs.Gross margin increased in fiscal year 2013 to a record high of 46.5%, compared to 33.3% in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to a favorable industry supply and demand environment coupled with a higher product mix of enterprise SSD products and high-performance retail products. These factors led to no year-over-year change in its average selling price per gigabyte, while its cost per gigabyte declined by 20%. Cost declines in fiscal year 2013 were derived from its increased mix of 19 nanometer wafers, lower depreciation costs for fab equipment, and weakening of the Japanese yen compared to the U.S. dollar. Net income for fiscal year 2013 was $1.27 billion or $5.31 per diluted share compared to $582 million or $2.38 per diluted share in fiscal year 2012.Competitive StrengthThe company has a strong portfolio of patents that help it to stay competitive in such a diverse and highly competitive market. As of the end of fiscal year 2013 the company had rights to more than 2,600 U.S. patents and more than 2,100 foreign patents. In addition, the company had more than 1,100 patent applications pending in the U.S. and had foreign counterparts pending on many of the applications in multiple jurisdictions.The company also has patent license agreements with many companies including SK Hynix Semiconductor (OTC:HXSCL), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Hitachi Ltd. (OTCPK:HTHIY), Renesas Electronics Corporation (NYSEMKT:NEN), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Sony Corporation (NYSE:SNE) and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF). In the three years ended December 29 2013, the company has generated $1.13 billion in revenues from license and royalty agreements.Future OutlookMobile products account for almost half of SanDisk's overall revenues and Apple is one of the primary drivers of revenue in this segment. According to Fool contributor Adam Levy, Apple accounted for around one fourth of SanDisk's revenue in the third quarter of 2013. SanDisk supplied flash memory for the iPhone 5 and it looks like it has gained further ground with the latest iPhones as evident in the bump in revenue and earnings. Many analysts, including Brain Marshall are very optimistic regarding the upcoming model of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 6. This upcoming revolutionary product could boost SanDisk's prospects. Brain Marshall believes that new iPhone 6 could add over $3 in EPS in the second half of 2014. He also believes that the iPhone 6 will be launched as 2 new models this year, one with a 4.7"" screen and the other with a 5.5"" screen. The company's strong standing with Apple makes it well-positioned to gain from the next iPhone(s) later this year. Moreover, Apple's China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) deal can provide a further push to the company as analysts expect this venture to help Apple add around 15 million to 30 million units this year.The company closed out last year with record-high revenue and the enterprise SSD segment enjoyed a dramatic expansion. The fourth quarter last year was a particularly strong period for computer-related SSDs with shipments of around 12 million units that increased year-end revenues to $6.8 billion. By 2017, PC SSD industry revenue of $22.6 billion will come close to narrowing the gap with PC HDD revenue of $23.5 billion. The SSD space includes the cache SSD segment where NAND flash is used alongside a hard disk drive as well as a separate segment in which NAND flash is embedded on top of an HDD in an integrated and hybrid form factor.AnalysisAccording to the company's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2013 results, SSD product revenue set another quarterly record and represented 19% of its annual revenue. I believe that the increasing growth in SSD will substantially increase the company's revenues along with its market share.Source: Annual Report 2013According to Trendfocus, SanDisk's market share is currently at 16.8%, positioning it at second place after Samsung (31.3%). As mentioned above, overall SSD product revenues for 2013 was $6.8 billion and is expected to grow to $22.6 billion by the end of 2017. As per the given market share the company's SSD revenues for 2013 were $1.14 billion and quite similar to company's actual SSD revenues of $1.17 billion. I believe that the growth in SSD along with its strong bond with Apple will help the company to boost its market share. Moreover, an increase in overall SSD will also boost the company's SSD revenues. The table above shows the growth in overall SSD revenues will also increase the company's SSD revenues.Looking at the company's currently shares outstanding 225.51 million shares company's current revenue per share of its SSD product seems quite substantial at 5.07 per share. Company's share repurchase program of $150 million is assumed constant for the forecasting period. If the industry grows as expected, along with its market share, the revenue per share will increase substantially over the years and will add substantial value to the company's bottom line as the company is heavily focused on reducing its costs.As part of its efforts to continuously reduce the cost of NAND flash, the company is currently focused on transitioning its products to 19 nanometer and 1Ynanometer technologies and it plans to transition to 1Z nanometer technology beginning in late 2014 and throughout the 2015 time frame. Its 1Ynanometer and subsequent technology nodes have increased manufacturing equipment requirements and this has reduced the cost reduction benefits obtainable through these technologies compared with previous technology node transitions.ConclusionAfter recording strong revenue and EPS growth the company is heading towards strong earnings growth backed by SSD growth and the launch of the iPhone 6. The company benefits from its leading position within the accelerating transition from hard disk drives to solid state drives. Furthermore, SanDisk returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback and dividend payments. Besides that the company has 8.83% free cash flow yields with EBITDA poised to grow in 2014 allowing for substantial returns of capital to shareholders that will improve ROE going forward. I believe that SanDisk presents itself as an attractive opportunity for investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by APEX Financial Consultants.

I am always looking for a combination of value and growth stocks, and if the company also pays a dividend it is even better. One such a company is SanDisk Corp. (SNDK), which its stock, in my opinion, is a remarkably promising long term investment.SanDisk Corporation is a global leader in flash memory storage solutions with a strong history of innovation that has been successfully commercialized. Flash storage technology allows digital information to be stored in a durable, compact format that retains the data even after the power has been switched off. The company is also a major supplier of solid state drive, or SSD, solutions for client computing platforms and enterprise data centers, and removable and embedded memory products for mobile devices, cameras and other devices. SSD does much the same job functionally as a hard disk drive HDD, but instead of a magnetic coating on top of platters, the data is stored on interconnected flash memory chips that retain the data even when there's no power present.SanDisk announced its fourth-quarter fiscal 2013 earnings report on January 22, which beat EPS expectations by $0.15 and beat on revenues. SanDisk's success was mainly attributable to strong client and enterprise SSD sales, strength in retail businesses and favorable supply demand metrics. Fourth quarter revenue of $1.73 billion increased 12 percent on a year-over-year basis and increased 6 percent sequentially. Total revenue for fiscal 2013 of $6.17 billion increased 22 percent from $5.05 billion in fiscal 2012. On a non-GAAP basis, fourth quarter net income was $390 million, or $1.71 per diluted share, compared to net income of $257 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and net income of $371 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Net income for fiscal 2013 was $1.27 billion, or $5.31 per diluted share, compared to $582 million, or $2.38 per diluted share in fiscal 2012.Now let's look at the numbers, SanDisk has recorded strong revenue and EPS growth during the last five years. The average annual sales growth for the past five years was high at 13%, and the average annual EPS growth for the past five years was very high at 20%. According to Yahoo Finance, SanDisk's next financial year forward P/E is at 11.13, and the average annual earnings growth estimates for the next five years is at 12.50%, these give a very low PEG ratio of 0.89, one of the lowest among S&P 500 tech stocks. The PEG Ratio - price/earnings to growth ratio is a widely used indicator of a stock's potential value. It is favored by many investors over the P/E ratio because it also accounts for growth. A lower PEG means that the stock is more undervalued. Furthermore, SanDisk is generating a lot of cash; its ttm price to free cash flow of 10 is among the lowest of all S&P 500 tech stocks. Many investors prefer using free cash flow instead of net income to measure a company's financial performance because free cash flow is more difficult to manipulate. Free cash flow is the operating cash flow minus capital expenditure.The company continues to deliver large sums of cash back to shareholders. On July 31, 2013, SanDisk announced that it has expanded its capital return program with the initiation of a quarterly dividend and the authorization of $2.5 billion of additional stock repurchases. SanDisk has not paid dividends before, and although the forward annual dividend yield of 1.31% is modest, it represents only 10% of the company net earnings, allowing SanDisk enough cash to continue investing to increase the SSD product portfolio and strengthen enterprise go-to-market strategies.ConclusionSanDisk has recorded strong revenue and EPS growth, and it has compelling valuation metrics and strong earnings growth prospects. Furthermore, SanDisk returns value to its shareholders by stock buyback and by dividend payments. The company benefits from its leading position within the accelerating transition from hard disk drive to solid state drive. During the latest quarter, SanDisk continued to increase the revenue contribution from SSDs, which rose to 21% of revenue. Most growth in SSD continues to come from enterprise SSD. CEO Mehrotra noted that enterprise storage solutions, including SSD, are expected to be SanDisk's fastest-growing category in 2014.All these factors lead me to the conclusion that SNDK stock is a smart long-term investment.Disclosure: I am long SNDK.

1998281,25047,2014-02-06T05:23:18-05:00,,"When it comes to financials, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) look pretty similar. In the last quarter WDC shipped 63.1 million HDDs at an ASP of $60 for revenue of $3.97 billion and operating profit of $478 million. STX, for its part, shipped 56.6 million units at an ASP of $62 for revenue of $3.53 billion and operating profit of $508 million (Source: WDC presentation; STX presentation).For this, WDC gets a market capitalization of $19.6 billion and a forward P/E of 9.7 times earnings (for the year ending in June 2015). STX has a market capitalization of $16.4 billion and trades at a forward P/E of 8.8 times (for the year ending in June 2015). Both companies also have similar revenue growth expectations for the year ending in June 2015 as well, with revenues expected to grow slightly more than 1% over that timeframe.These companies are thus very evenly matched, WDC is only slightly more expensive and both sell a commodity product, hard drives.While I am not going into the merits of investing in the hard drive business, I will however say something: There's a powerful reason to favor WDC over STX.The reasonA couple of weeks ago, online backup provider Backblaze published a study on HDD failure rates. Backblaze had already published similar studies in the past, but this time Backblaze actually separated failures by brand.And therein lies the problem. Seagate drives saw much larger failure rates than either Western Digital or Hitachi.This tremendous difference might have been influenced by the use of retail drives or even the positioning of the drives. But still, this is the info that exists, and such info is likely to inform HDD buyers in the next few quarters.As such, one would either expect volume or price pressure to affect Seagate. Since ASPs are very similar between STX and WDC, it's highly likely that HDD buyers will favor WDC (or Hitachi) drives at nearly the same price. So either STX accepts lower volume without affecting its prices, or STX will be forced to sell at a discount to make up for its perceived lower reliability.Both of these consequences would affect STX's revenues and/or operating profits. It might also amount to nothing, but given the very close valuation the risk is enough to warrant favoring WDC over STX.Seagate had no reaction to this study, no press releases were issued refuting its conclusions. As I said it was possible to ascribe the reliability problems to such factors as the fact that retail drives were used or the position they were mounted in. Still, what remains is the fact that this study was seen by many buyers and might influence their buying decisions in the next few quarters.ConclusionIn a very visible study, Backblaze identified significant reliability problems with STX HDDs. This is likely to drive either STX volumes down, or to force STX to sell at a discount. Due to this, and since STX trades at a very similar valuation to WDC, it makes more sense to hold WDC, without this obvious problem, than to hold STX, with this obvious problem.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1984581,48501,2014-01-31T10:50:52-05:00,,"Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) reported strong fiscal second quarter results as revenues increased 4.4% sequentially. Second quarter results were driven by accretive enterprise and consumer electronics shipments. That is a trend that is likely to continue in the current quarter.Management is forecasting revenues of $3.65-$3.75 billion and gross margin of 29.5% for the current quarter. This would be a 7.5% revenues decline sequentially. Revenues would be flat y/y.With WDC benefiting from SSD shipments and increasing demand for electronic data storage solutions, a P/B of 2.32 isn't pricey. The P/B level of 2.91 is the distribution level. The underlying business is healthy, but share price may catch a cold from the broader market. Additionally, Asia may suffer a slowdown if conditions in China worsen, which could adversely impact WDC's results of operations.Recent DevelopmentsBusiness SummaryWestern Digital Corp. is a global provider of products and services that empower people to create, manage, experience and preserve digital content. WDC designs and manufactures storage devices, networking equipment, and home entertainment products.Revenues in the fiscal second quarter increased 4.4% sequentially, which followed a 2% sequential increase in the first quarter. The gross profit margin was flat sequentially in the second quarter, but a significant increase in SG&A expenditure reduced the operating margin from 14.2% to 12%. Net income declined 13% sequentially and the net profit margin in the second quarter was 11%. Additionally, EPS declined 13.7% sequentially.The TAM increased in the second quarter to 142.2M from 140.2M, as WDC's HDD share remained flat at about 44%. HDD ASPs increased from $58 to $60 sequentially but were down from $62 the prior year. HDD ASPs have trended lower since mid-2012.WDC's sales were boosted by its design wins in the Xbox One and PS4 gaming consoles. The impact from the new consoles should be accretive to sales during a large part of calendar 2014. Also, I expect a spike in sales during the calendar Q4 2014 as the price points on the new consoles may decline.Enterprise and consumer electronics were relative bright spots during the quarter. Unit shipments of enterprise and consumer electronics increased 17% and 36% y/y, respectively. Branded products increased 14% sequentially on WD My Cloud. This comes as the PC market stabilizes.Growth in SSD usage is expected to be significant in the coming years. Gartner estimates that there will be 72,000 petabytes of SSDs by 2017, which is up from about 5,800 in 2012. WDC is positioning itself to benefit from this industry trend.The company reported an economic loss in the fiscal second quarter. This does not agree with my analysis. My equity charge is $2.54 per share for the next twelve months and WDC should easily earn my cost of equity. Management probably uses a higher discount rate.In terms of liquidity at the end of 2013, the cash ratio was 1 and the current ratio was 1.79. Net cash at the end of the quarter was $2.315B. Total debt to equity was 0.27 and financial leverage was 1.78. Overall, the liquidity and solvency positions appear solid.The receivables turnover ratio, on an annualized basis, was 8.11 during the December quarter. The inventory turnover ratio was 8.76. Overall, the activity of the firm was healthy. Additionally, the estimated return on equity is 20%.RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in WDC.Valuation & Portfolio ManagementThe increase in the share price of WDC is in large part attributable to broad economic trends. While the company has made several key strategic acquisitions and formed key partnerships, the increase in the market-based valuation is mostly attributable to economic growth, loose monetary policy, and investor's demand for shares. This is in contrast to increases in share prices that are primarily based on company specific factors. Potential WDC investors could get an excellent opportunity to accumulate shares at a lower price point than the current share price of $83.91.There isn't much of a diversification benefit from investing in WDC, relative to the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY). The correlation since 2009 is 0.88. Since 2011, the correlation is 0.96. And since 2013, the correlation is 0.97. All three correlations are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level, relative to zero correlation.Thus, variations in the share price of the S&P 500 explain a substantial amount of the variations in the share price of WDC. Since 2009, the portion of the variation in the share price of WDC explained by the share price of the S&P 500 ranged from 77% to 94%. Consequently, forecasts for the share price of WDC should include forecasts for the broader market.Is WDC likely to outperform the broader market? My model says, ""yes."" I place the chance of outperformance at 60%. Granted, that outperformance could mean WDC declines less than the broader market.Including the recently released results, WDC is trading at 2.32 times book value. Factoring in the fundamentals of the company, WDC should not be trading at a substantial premium to the market. The market is priced at 2.6 times book. The WDC justified P/B is 2.44 with the distribution level at 2.91 and the accumulation level at 2.15.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company has manufacturing facilities in China and Japan. SanDisk is well known for its design, development, and manufacturing of flash memory storage. SanDisk's product portfolio includes solid-state drives and caching software for laptops, PCs and enterprise applications; USB flash drives, memory cards for smartphones and cameras; embedded flash drives for mobile phones and tablets, USB flash drives; and other flash-based products.Financial Performance HighlightsSanDisk performed very well for the fourth quarter and full year of 2013. The revenues for 2013 increased quite impressively by 22% to $6.18 billion compared to $5.05 billion in 2012. For the fourth quarter the revenues were $1.73 billion reflecting a YOY increase of 12%, however the non-GAAP net income of $390 million increased significantly by 52%. The diluted earnings per share of $1.45 increased from per share earnings of $0.87 in the fourth quarter of 2012. The revenues from iNAND and MCP iNAND due to rapid adaptation in entry-level and mid-level mobiles contributed towards total growth. Additionally, SanDisk's revenues from retail channels represented 38% of the fourth quarter revenues and increased 18% year over year driven by growth in USBs, SSDs and memory chips. For the fourth quarter client and SSD sales increased sequentially to account for 21% of total revenues. The enterprise SSD did well with new record revenues in the fourth quarter and strong customer adaptation of lightning SAS drives.SanDisk has cash and short-term investments worth $2.91 billion compared to $2.04 billion in the previous quarter and for dividend-seeking investors that would be satisfactory. The company generated $616.8 million in cash from operating activities compared to $382.4 million from the previous quarter. SanDisk repurchased stocks worth $150 million and paid dividends amounting to $50.6 million.ULLtarDIMM SSD and iNAND Extreme Would Perform Well for SanDiskThe explosive growth and consumption of data in cloud computing and data centers is increasingly requiring network architectures to build products that can enable low latency while providing fast and reliable access to information. SanDisk serves this segment with its enterprise SSD and enterprise software products. SanDisk has recently introduced its new solid state drive aimed at the enterprise server market boosting ultra-low latency for quicker applications response. SanDisk has developed the ULLtarDIMM SSD in partnership with Diablo Technologies by embedding flash technology into the DRAM memory channel. It is available in 200GB and 400GB capacities. The storage solution uses the DIMM form factor and offers scalability without impacting latency making it ideal for high-frequency trading, transaction processing, virtualization, and cloud computing. As SanDisk continues to innovate its SSD product line brighter chances are emerging for the company to grow and this addition would help the company to further boost its earnings.Tablets and ultrabooks have certain requirements for manufacturers and technology suppliers, such as instant functionality, durability, and low-power consumption. Because of these requirements, flash memory has become the main storage technology for these computing devices. SanDisk supplies embedded flash drives and removable memory cards to virtually every major tablet and ultrabook manufacturer.Flash memory has become an essential component in smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices due to its large capacity storage, market price point, and low power consumption with no moving parts. SanDisk provides embedded flash drives and removable memory cards to almost every major smartphone and tablet maker. Recently at Mobile World Congress SanDisk has announced iNAND extreme embedded flash drive for android smartphones and tablets. As the demand for high-performance smartphones and tablets with 64-bit chipset increases the iNAND extreme embedded flash drive will be the ideal option for robust mobile photography as well as video and gaming applications. This flash drive would become a part of smartphones and tablets by mid 2014 and would deliver growing sales for SanDisk.SanDisk's First Ultra MicroSDXC 128GBAt Mobile World Congress 2014, SanDisk introduced the first ever high-performance 128GB ultra microSDXC memory card thereby strengthening its solid state drive portfolio. Since the high-end smartphones and tablets market is growing rapidly storage requirement is also increasing. Up until now memory card storage was limited to 64GB. The ultra microSDXC card is expected to be the ideal experience for android smartphones and tablets by enhancing overall memory capacity and performance. It will give users the enhanced capacity to capture videos, photos, songs and documents without being worried about storage capacity shortage. SanDisk believes that the drive is capable of delivering a device with high speed, and energy efficient features. SanDisk's decision to market this memory card through BestBuy.com and Amazon.com will be an immediate advantage to the company. It can be expected that SanDisk's microSD card will be very popular and the company's sales volume will grow significantly.The following graph shows NAND flash demand dynamics and supply dynamics.Source: dramexchangeTrendForce predicts that SSD NAND Flash consumption will increase from 13% to 25% in 2014. The growth is likely to be higher than the existing demand for other NAND Flash products. Thus I expect that SanDisk has the potential to secure a 10% to 12% revenue share by 2014. The company expects to continue investing to increase the SSD product portfolio and strengthen its enterprise market strategies. The company expects to increase its wafer capacity by approximately 5%. Moreover, the company expects to return 70% of the free cash flows generated through share repurchases as part of its capital return strategy. The total SSD market is poised for considerable growth and SanDisk is perfectly positioned to gain benefits. I would suggest investors consider SanDisk for their portfolios.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by a Blackstone Equity Research research analyst.

SanDisk is an American multinational corporation that designs and manufactures flash storage solutions and software for mobile phones, cameras and solid state drives. Flash-memory storage is strategic for these devices because it can be manufactured to take up less space, performs more reliably, and requires less power than traditional hard drives. The fact that flash memory storage requires less power than hard drives is advantageous for mobile devices, in which battery life is an essential and scrutinized metric. Over the past 6 quarters SanDisk has met or exceeded the Wall Street consensus in each quarter, this time around the buy-side thinks things might be different.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see All Estimates for SanDisk)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for SanDisk to report $1.58 EPS and $1.704B revenue while our current consensus from 26 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is $1.53 EPS and $1.701B revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by our communtiy is expecting SanDisk to miss the Wall Street consensus on both profit and revenue.The magnitude of the difference between Wall Street's and our consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case we are seeing a large difference between the 2 groups’ forecasts.Over the past 4 quarters our consensus has been more accurate on SanDisk for both EPS and revenue. After 4 quarters in a row of predicting SanDisk to beat Wall Street’s forecast, this quarter our community is bucking that trend and expecting SNDK to come up short.By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non professional investors, we have created a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market’s actual expectations. It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from us than from the Wall Street consensus. This means that even if SanDisk only reports in line with Wall Street, we would still expect to see the stock price go up relative to the market because SanDisk has beaten the Buy-Side’s expectations. For more information about expected post earnings drift and quantitative research on the data check out estimize.com/api .The distribution of estimates published by our analysts range from $1.39 to $1.65 EPS and $1.650B to $1.760B in revenues. This quarter we’re seeing a moderate distribution of estimates compared to previous quarters.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A larger distribution of estimates signaling the potential for greater volatility post earnings, a smaller vice versa.This quarter we saw significant upward analyst estimate revisions on SanDisk. The Wall Street profit consensus increased from $1.42 to $1.58 while our profit forecast surged from $1.40 to $1.53. The Wall Street revenue consensus shot up from $1.662B to $1.704B. Our revenue consensus also skyrocketed from $1.510B to $1.701B at the end of the quarter. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy, and a rapid increase in the community consensus going into the report is often a bullish indicator. The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is Nils1975 who projects $1.64 EPS and $1.705B in revenue. In the Winter 2014 season, Nils175 is currently ranked as the 16th best analyst and is ranked 13th overall among over 3,450 contributing analysts. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case the highest rated analyst is expecting SanDisk to report slightly ahead of Wall Street on revenue, but way above on profit.While our analysts are expecting SanDisk to miss the Wall Street consensus, the surging analyst revisions are a positive indicator. Because the stock price movement of a company after announcing profit is more highly correlated to our benchmark than to Wall Street, we could see SNDK beat our consensus, miss Wall Street's, and you could still expect the stock price to drift upward relative to the broader market over the next 3 days."
1958071,53482,2014-01-21T17:13:05-05:00,,"In my most recent article, I talked about a rule based investment strategy that ranked Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as one of the strongest investment opportunities out of companies with a market cap over $15bn.In this article, I continue the series and present another investment opportunity in the form of flash storage provider, SanDisk Corp. (SNDK).Twenty rulesI will not go into too much detail about the rules used for this analysis since I have talked about them in two previous articles.It is enough to say that the approach is based on 20 rules that have been shown to produce 20+% returns over a period of nearly 20 years.The rules are a mix of quantitative and qualitative factors, and each rule (if satisfied) is given a score of 1. Higher scores indicate better investment opportunities, with stocks scoring over 10 considered to be interesting. Stocks under 10 should be ignored.Stock analysisTo start the analysis I ran a test on over 4000 US stocks using a stock screener that was tuned to filter out companies that did not meet my criteria.From over 4000 stocks, I was left with only 3 stocks with market caps over $15bn that met my criteria: Apple (AAPL), Constellation Brands (NYSE:STZ) and SanDisk.I then exported the data into Excel and used company data to fill in the missing blanks.You can see how SanDisk scored and what factors were used below:ResultsAs you can see from the table, SanDisk scored very highly using the rule based system and this sets it apart from the majority of its peers.SanDisk failed on only three accounts; it has not filed a dividend for each of the last five years, its dividend yield is lower than 2% and more than 3% of total shares issued were in options.This is a negative for shareholders since we do not want earnings or the value of dividends to be diluted by more shares. (A look at the annual reports does show that options outstanding has been in a downward trend for the last three years, however.)Regarding SanDisk's dividend policy it is also of interest to investors that the company instigated its first ever dividend program in July last year.Macro viewSanDisk Corp. scored highly on the basis of promising valuation statistics and previous performance, which have been found to be the best indicators for future growth. (The rules based strategy has been responsible for 23% annual gains since 1997 and 40% annually in the Australian share market over the last 5 years).In keeping with rule number three, SanDisk operates in a sector that is likely to grow substantially over the next 5 years.Flash storage for smartphones, tablets and PCs is strong, driven by the uptake of SSDs and NAND flash which is expected to grow by 13.3% in 2014 according to Trendforce.The uptake of SanDisk's SSDs and embedded memory products have helped maintain strong growth and the company now derives around 13% of revenue from its key customer, Apple.With a new iPhone around the corner and news of Chinese preorders on the iPhone 5s exceeding 1 million units, SanDisk is likely to be a benefactor of what could potentially be another 15-20 million iPhones in production.Cloud riskOne risk factor, however, is that the rise of cloud computing could dent SanDisk's role as chief storage provider. That may be true but it is some way off, as shipments on laptops, PCs and smartphones, which utilize SSD technology testify.More importantly, SSDs are likely to be utilized in many cloud storage solutions, which could negate any downside from the move away from local memory.Furthermore, SanDisk products are already used in many of the world's largest data centers, meaning the company is also a good play on the trend for 'big data'.ConclusionIrrespective of any opinion on the future of flash memory, the continued uptake of SSDs or the prospects for more iPhone sales, the fundamentals indicate that SanDisk is a high quality company with watertight financials.SanDisk had an excellent 2013 and its stock currently sits at all time record highs. Even so, it is still cheaply priced for prudent investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in SNDK, over the next 72 hours.

1923341,39301,2013-12-31T14:36:54-05:00,,"Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) could be one of the most compelling investment opportunities going into its fiscal 2014 year. Investors should however consider the risks when investing in high beta technology names.Data storage is a rapidly growing industry and even with downward pricing pressure reducing the cost per GB, the company offsets this negative impact by selling a large volume of data. Going forward data storage is expected to grow at high enough of compound annual growth rates to merit a long-term investment from a momentum/growth perspective.Fundamental AnalysisI'm going to start by focusing on financial statement analysis. But to do that properly, I'd start by looking at the financial statement below.Source: Western DigitalOver the past three years, Western Digital has been able to increase revenue at a 17.24% CAGR (compound annual growth rate). Cost of revenue has increased 12.41% CAGR (3-years), which implies that per year, costs have been able to increase at a lower rate than revenues, which implies that Western Digital has been able to reduce production costs as a percentage of revenue per year. However, operating expenses have increased by 45.28% CAGR per year (3-years), which implies that the company has been increasing R&D/SG&A/Compensation related expenses, in order to drive significant revenue growth. Operating expenditures only represented 20% of revenues in the 2013 fiscal year. This means that even though operating expenditure is increasing at a much higher rate than revenues, the operating expenditure is still a small proportion of costs, and can be reduced or maintained in order to drive even further net income growth in future fiscal years.Net income has grown by 10.52% over the past 3-years. Net income could have grown at a much higher rate, but because the company has increased R&D expenditure from $1 billion to $1.57 billion between fiscal year 2012 and 2013, the company hasn't been able to drive meaningful earnings improvements. This is likely to change in the foreseeable future.Source: Yahoo! FinanceCurrently Western Digital Corporation has the second largest market capitalization when compared to peers. It also has the second highest number of employees, and I can only imagine this to have been driven by the rising R&D and SG&A spending between FY 2012 and FY 2013. The company has the third highest revenue amongst peers, but at the same time it's a more focused play on data storage than Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) or EMC (EMC). Also, because Western Digital is now offering cloud services (infrastructure as a service), perhaps it could have a couple more investment years ahead of it, forcing investors to value the company based on its ability to grow sales then cut on expenses in future years to generate EPS growth.Currently Western Digital has the second highest gross margins amongst peers. Considering Western Digital sells both discrete and non-discrete drives this should come as no surprise to investors. For those who don't know what discrete is: it's selling drives to end consumers for personal storage. Non-discrete is selling drives to the data center (central storage). There may be many variations to this definition of data storage, but that's the one that has made the most sense to me.EMC has higher gross margin, because it's primarily engaged in cloud virtualization. Also, EMC offers storage solutions that are specifically dedicated to data centers or intense computing applications giving it higher gross margins when compared to Western Digital. However, as a general cloud vendor it seems that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services is pulling ahead, as it has solutions for all forms of cloud (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS).Currently Western Digital generates the third most net income amongst its peers. Western Digital fell behind Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX) in this specific category, because it spends more on R&D and SG&A than Seagate. This can also be substantiated with Western Digital having the second lowest operating margins when compared to peers.However, when it comes to valuation metrics, Western Digital has the highest P/E ratio and it has the second highest P/S ratio, which implies that investors have high expectations for Western Digital. Usually a stock has a higher P/E multiple because the stock will generate above average earnings growth against sector peers or the broader market. Investors pay more for higher growth opportunities in general.Technical analysisCurrently Western Digital has been able to exhibit fairly consistent share price appreciation, and has been able to beat the broader market return and even the NASDAQ over the past year. Currently Western Digital is 100.76% off of its 52-week low, and most investors would be very cautious of chasing a stock when considering the sheer amount of price appreciation the stock has already exhibited.Source: FreeStockChartsPurely examining the technical analysis, the stock could have a bit of trouble breaking above the upper-trend-line. It's still in an up-trend, however, so from a timing standpoint the one thing that investors should probably avoid is trying to buy above the trend line. Long-term investors shouldn't bother to attempt timing the stock as it's probably most practical/effective to just dollar cost average using monthly contributions into the position.The stock is trading above the 20, 50, and 200-day moving averages and the volume is trending lower. The falling volume is indicative of share accumulation. The sustained actions above the moving averages indicate that the stock is in a strong up-trend.Industry, earnings, price forecastsThe usage of data is growing at a 34% CAGR, and is expected to sustain this exponential growth between the 2013 and 2020 period. This gives investors high rates of growth for a protracted period of timing making it an appealing long-term investment position.Source: Western DigitalWestern Digital is turning more of its focus to the SSD (solid state drive) enterprise market. It is expected to grow at a fairly exponential rate between 2013 and 2017.Source: Western DigitalCurrently the enterprise SSD total addressable market (TAM) is $3.2 billion. By 2017 this market is expected to grow to around $7.2 billion and it's hoping to maintain its current 18% market share. However, Western Digital doesn't necessarily provide insights on future market share. So I'm willing to assume it can at least capture 25% to 30% of the enterprise SSD market and it will generate around $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion from SSD drives alone. Solid state drives have higher power usage efficiency and given enough time datacenters can recoup the higher per/GB costs from the energy savings alone.Note: EPS figures up until 2013 are GAAP based, however EPS figures from 2014 onwards are Non-GAAP making the historical non-congruent to projected figures.For fiscal year 2014, I expect the earnings per share figure to grow from $8.53 to $10.17 (both non-GAAP). I expect earnings between fiscal year 2013 and 2014 to grow by 19.22%. This type of earnings growth would depend heavily on both high revenue growth, sustained improvement of gross margin, and a moderate reduction of operating expenditures. Between fiscal year 2014 and 2015, I expect the EPS figure to grow by 13.5%, because the company may attempt another investment year. However, the long-term EPS growth I have estimated between 2016 and 2019 is 16.53% per year. Acceleration of growth should eventually occur as product development reaches maturation and scale is built into the operation.In the most optimistic scenario I expect the share price to appreciate from $97 to $231 per share. The very broad range is due to the heavily undervalued nature of data storage plays from both a historical and non-historical standpoint. That being the case, I give a mid-point value of $134 per share for 2014, which implies that the stock may be able to appreciate by an additional 61.7% from current levels. I have already assumed the best case scenario for EPS, so it's extremely unlikely that the stock will reach the upper bound price level of $231. However, if it does… well I should think about building further redundancies into my long-term forecasts.I think that data storage will remain a compelling play going forward. The worst that may happen is that the stock only appreciates from $82.82 per share to $97 per share, generating returns of 17.11% for calendar year 2014. Those kinds of returns aren't bad, and should be sufficient to beat the S&P 500 or the Dow Component.However, over the long-term assuming a 2019 mid-point of $313.50, investors may be able to generate returns of 24.84% per year on a CAGR basis (assuming the investor buys the stock today). This means that at least over the long haul, investors are going to beat the market every year for the next six years, assuming EPS and revenues continue to trend higher.ConclusionI believe that data storage is a hotly contested space that investors should keep their eyes on. Hopefully Western Digital lowers its operating expenditure and generates continued cost efficiencies from production. Assuming that's the case, earnings should be able to beat analyst expectations in the 2014 fiscal year.Since data consumption is expected to grow at such a high rate, I believe that investors have heavily underappreciated the momentum from Western Digital's core business. Assuming the business runs out of ways to invest its capital, the company could always turn to share buybacks to drive meaningful EPS growth.By now you should know how I feel, but I'll say it anyway. Western Digital is a compelling investment opportunity and I give it a buy recommendation for 2014.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1958671,32001,2014-01-22T00:27:07-05:00,,"One of our best performing stocks from mid-2012 forward, SanDisk (SNDK) reports its calendar Q4 13 results after the bell on Wednesday night, January 22, 2014.Analyst consensus is expecting $1.57 in earnings per share (EPS) on $1.7 billion in revenue for expected year-over-year growth of 19% and 10% respectively.If 2014 analyst consensus is sustained, current estimates are for $6.73 billion in revenues and $5.81 in earnings per share, for expected year-over-year growth of 9% and 12%, respectively. (The easy earnings comparisons from late 2012 and early 2013 are now over.)Since its dip into the low $30s in mid-2012, SNDK has benefited from 2 very important tailwinds:1.) A weaker yen, which has really helped drive gross margins. Every 10% depreciation in the yen typically is worth 400 bps of additional margin to SNDK (with a limit of course);2.) Due to a ""constrained"" supply environment, bit pricing has been very strong: typically SNDK grows megabytes mid teens y/y, with some weakness in pricing driven by ASP declines. For the last 4 quarters, SNDK's ASPs have grown -3%, +5%, +2%, and +7% respectively. Last quarter, the 3% drop caught my eye since (supposedly) the fundamentals around supply remain strong. For comparison, during 2012's collapse its ASPs fell 22% and 18% in the March and June quarters of 2012;This company is uber-cyclical, and although sell-side analysts have been talking about the continued discipline around supply coming back online, the fact is that when it does, numbers get cut in a hurry and investors can give up a lot of alpha.Technically SNDK's all-time high was $78-$79 back in January, 2006. The ensuing few years were quite painful.We trimmed 25% of our SNDK position that we wrote about here after the July '13 report, and then again here.Peak gross margin for SNDK in late '05, early '06 was 45%, and then again the gross margin hit 52% in 2010, although the stock price never followed.Last quarter, SNDK printed a 50% gross margin, and as long as I've followed the company and the fundamentals, establishing positions at these gross margin heights was a bad idea.We have a 1.5% position in SNDK, down from 4%-5% last summer, and we may or may not sell before Wednesday night's earnings report.Trading at 11(x) cash-flow the valuation on the stock isn't completely unreasonable, but that is typically the case with cyclicals: they must be sold when the valuation looks cheap, and bought when there are no earnings and cash flow is thin.Our internal model values SNDK currently at $95 per share, but the same model had a $31 intrinsic value estimate for SNDK in March, 2012, one quarter following, or 90 days after the same model assigned a $54 intrinsic value estimate, and right before earnings fell out of bed. The sector supply conditions changed that quickly from December, 2011 to March, 2012.Morningstar doesn't assign an intrinsic value estimate to SNDK, which tells you how fast the supply conditions can change.This is a great company with a great management team, but SNDK is in a sector where conditions can change dramatically and quickly.We are close to exiting the position. Just not sure when we sell the final position. Most analysts are saying ""it is different this time"" and that there is supply discipline around bit supply. That could be the case, but how often does this end badly?Be careful out there, and thanks for reading.Disclosure: I am long SNDK. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

In 2013 SanDisk had a great year with its stock price up over 50%. As a possible investment, I would like to take a deeper look at the fundamental characteristics. As noted in my first article I place heavy emphasis on the cash flow of a company. Ultimately, the free cash flow will be returned to investors through future dividends, stock repurchase arrangements and other company investments. Typically, I would like to analyze the correlation between revenue, operating cash flow, capital expenditure and free cash flow.As of 1/17/14 SNDK is trading at $73.69. Over the course of the past year their sales have risen 27% and operating cash flow has risen 198%. The operating and free cash flows increased dramatically between the third quarter 2012 and the first quarter 2013. Cash flows have leveled off during the second and third quarters of the year.However, this was about the same time that SanDisk initiated a dividend and announced an increase to their share repurchase program. Both of these factors were a great return for investors. Since inception of the share repurchase program SNDK bought $673MM worth of stock. As of last quarter, SNDK still has $2B available for repurchasing shares. Such financial investments provide insight to the company's guidance. Clearly, management has a positive outlook for the company. Additionally, even with the dividend and stock repurchases, SNDK had a quarter over quarter increase in free cash flow. Such an increase could be a sign of their efficiency in converting sales to cash and return to investors.Other FundamentalsGenerally, I prefer a company to pay a dividend greater than 2%. Currently, SanDisk is paying a 1.22% dividend. However, 2013 was the first year that SanDisk paid a dividend. Such strong free cash flows would correlate to future increases in the dividend paid. SanDisk also has a strong current ratio of 3.31, which is particularly strong for the industry. Also, it has a profit margin of 17.04%, which is also aligned with the industry.ConclusionEven with the 2013 appreciation, I would still consider SNDK a buy. The stock is fairly valued at 11.5x its cash flow. Management has made great efforts to feed the appetite of the investors. There is still room for this stock to run and long-term investors will see much return.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1918411,21523,2013-12-27T12:22:20-05:00,,"If there is one trend in electronics over the past 10-15 years that towers above all other, it is mobility. Starting with PDAs in the late 1990s, the portability trend has expanded through a huge number of categories, starting with MP3 players like the iPod and continuing into GPS devices, smartphones, tablets, electronic book readers, ultra-thin and low power notebooks, wearable fitness trackers, etc. In fact, I'm willing to wager that you or someone in your family received some kind of portable electronic device as a holiday gift this year. Mobile electronic devices have become ubiquitous in our world.One of the core technologies that make this possible is flash memory storage. Flash has many advantages over traditional mechanical hard drive storage. Flash is more durable (minor drops and bumps usually won't damage it), requires less power (important for battery operated devices), can be manufactured in much smaller and unique form factors (important for slim/light devices), and have faster read access times (making the device feel faster).With these advantages, along with falling prices and the continuing move to mobile, a pure play flash stock selling at a price cheap enough to be screened by Magic Formula® Investing should be an interesting investment candidate.SanDisk (SNDK) - A Pure Play on FlashSanDisk is one of the only pure plays on flash in the market. SanDisk breaks its sales into two channels. The Retail channel is flash storage cards/sticks for smartphones, digital cameras, and the like (about 37% of sales). The Commercial channel includes embedded flash solutions for OEM customers and solid state drives, or SSDs, that replace traditional hard drives in newer PCs. SanDisk has moved aggressively into Enterprise SSDs with the purchase of SMART Storage Systems a few months ago. SSDs now represent about 20% of revenues, from just 10% a year ago.Revenue growth is a highlight of an investment in SNDK. The company has grown the top line at a compound annual rate of 13% over the past five years, and over 20% over the last several quarters. Bit supply growth in 2013 has been about 20%, and is expected to be about 30% next year. Make no mistake, the move to flash storage will continue to be a secular trend in electronics.Another thing I like is SanDisk's move toward embedded flash and SSD solutions instead of relying on retail card sales. Cards are off-the-shelf items that consumers often purchase based on price instead of brand. Embedded solutions are designed into products and often have at least 1 year of sales, in addition to establishing OEM relationships that lead to repeat business. They are also less price sensitive - it is remarkable that SanDisk has recently been able to increase price-per-gigabyte (by 12%) while continuing its historical ability to reduce cost-per-gigabyte (by 19%). These factors should both improve the base gross margins for the company while easing some of its historical volatility. Speaking of which...Flash - A Commodity with Volatile Supply/Demand DynamicsFlash memory is a commodity. SanDisk has a lot of big, established competition, including Hynix, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Samsung, Toshiba and other smaller, generic producers. There is nothing special or rare about it - the only limit to supply are what semiconductor fabs can produce.Given this fact, and the fact that consumer electronics is a cyclical industry, flash supply and demand balance is very tenuous. Frantic production to catch up to demand often leads to dramatic over-supply when the CE market cools off. One needs only to look at SanDisk's financials to see this. The company swung from a $917 dollar operations loss in 2008 to a $1.5 billion dollar profit in 2011, and which was then cut in half to just a $700 million profit the following year.SanDisk right now is in a good supply/demand market. Sales are growing at 25%, and gross margins are at the high end of the company's 30-50% range. But we always need to plan for the next pothole in the road, which history shows us is not too far in the future.Is SanDisk A Buy?SanDisk should continue growing revenues, and the transition into embedded and SSDs is favorable. Additionally, the company just recently started paying a dividend (a skimpy 1.3% yield), and aggressively buying back shares ($1 billion in Q3 alone). The EBIT/EV earnings yield of 11.3% and cash yield of over 10% both look really attractive for this kind of growth. So is SanDisk a buy?The answer is a solid ""maybe."" Forecasting about 140% growth in free cash flow for 2013, followed by 10-15% growth from there, with an inevitable 50% pothole like 2012 along the way, I see SanDisk worth about $79 per share. That's about 13% of upside to the current price. While I'm slapping the ""positive"" opinion on the stock, 13% is not enough margin-of-safety to recommend it, especially in such a volatile industry.It is a reasonable opinion that SanDisk's business changes could soften bumps in the road going forward, and an argument could be made for a more aggressive growth assumption. SanDisk is a difficult stock to lock down a price for, and there are a wide range of potential outcomes here.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1967361,48501,2014-01-25T05:15:04-05:00,,"SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) reported solid fourth-quarter results with mid-single digit sequential revenue growth. This came on the back of strong solid-state drive sales and strong demand from the retail channel for memory products. Additionally, the profitability profile improved during the quarter.Management is calling for high-single digit revenue growth during the first quarter with full-year revenues between $6.4 billion and $6.8 billion. SanDisk should benefit from a healthy supply/demand balance in the NAND flash memory space in the coming quarters. But management believes that ASPs will be slightly softer in calendar 2014 than the prior year.Overall, the improvement of the profitability profile, the excess liquidity, and the valuation suggest SNDK still has a considerable amount of upside potential. In my opinion, SNDK should be valued at a premium, 3 times book, to the market.Recent DevelopmentsBusiness SummarySanDisk Corporation is a global leader in flash storage solutions. SNDK sells chips to device makers of smartphones, cameras, and other mobile devices. Also, SNDK is increasingly using NAND chips in its own branded solid-state drives, which are sold directly to companies and consumers. While they remain significantly more expensive than mechanical hard drives, SSDs are gaining popularity in data centers and consumer laptops because of their increased efficiency.The SSD product revenue performance was impressive and represented 19% of annual revenue. This came on the back of next generation mobile and enterprise data storage solutions. But management expects memory chip prices to fall more this year than in 2013. Additionally, as SSDs become a larger portion of the company, earnings should become less volatile.During the fourth quarter revenues increased 12% relative to the year-ago quarter, which was accompanied by a cost structure that enabled margin expansion. The operating margin expanded from 22% to 29.4% of revenues. Diluted EPS increased 66.7% relative to the year-ago quarter and 22.9% sequentially.The annual financial performance was also impressive with revenue increasing 22%, which was accompanied by margin expansion. Operating income more than doubled as the operating margin expanded from 13.8% to 25.3%. Diluted EPS increased 156%. The financial performance justifies price-based valuation multiple expansion.At the end of the calendar year, the cash ratio was 2.36, and the current ratio was 3.78. There was excess liquidity, which can be used for share repurchases or dividends. The financial leverage ratio was 1.51, which was partly attributable to a substantial amount of long-term marketable securities. Management should either return capital to investors or use the capital for strategic acquisitions, because there was ~$6 billion of cash on the balance sheet.Cash flow from operations increased from $530 million to an unsustainable $1.86 billion. There were $101 million of dividends paid during the year with $1.6 billion of share repurchases. So, in my opinion, the dividend will ramp at a rapid pace over the next few years. Capital expenditure was in the $200 million to $500 million range the past two years with free cash flow of $1.65 billion during this fiscal year.Management expects revenues of $1.45 billion to $1.52 billion for the first quarter, and $6.4 billion to $6.8 billion for the full year. First quarter 2013 revenues were $1.34 billion with a GAAP gross margin of 40%. The guidance represents 8% revenue growth at the low end.RisksThis section does not discuss all risks related to an investment in SanDisk.Valuation Portfolio Management(From a technicals perspective, it appears that SNDK is heading towards being in a trader's market. But the share price can keep going higher as the intermediate-term and primary-term trends are towards higher prices. That said, throwbacks to the 50-week or 200-day simple moving averages are dips to buy; more aggressive investors would use throwbacks to the 50-day SMA.Relative to the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY), there isn't much of a diversification benefit from investing in SNDK. The correlation since 2009 is 0.90. That drops to 0.81 since 2011. And since 2013, the correlation is 0.95. There is a strong linear relationship between the share price of SNDK and the S&P 500.Should we include forecasts for the broader market into our return expectations for SNDK? Since 2009, fluctuations in the share price of the S&P 500 explained 81% of the variations of the share price of SNDK. That number drops to 66% since 2011, and is 90% since 2013. So, forecasts for the share price of SNDK should include forecasts for the S&P 500.I employ 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month price targets. The price targets are $64.05, $67.25, and $71.68, respectively. At $72 per share, SNDK is trading above trend, which suggests a period of underperformance is likely in the coming months.Is SNDK likely to underperform the market in the coming months? Using my proprietary model, SNDK doesn't appear likely to underperform the market. I place the chance of outperformance at 60%. But the share price of both could decline with SNDK declining less than the broader market.The fundamentals of the company suggest that it should be valued above the market multiple. But SNDK trades at 2.5 times book while the market trades at 2.6 times book. The valuation suggests that the share price has upside potential; conservatively, I would price SNDK at 3 times book.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1889751,48501,2013-12-10T15:45:53-05:00,,"Western Digital Corporation (""Western"") (NASDAQ:WDC) is up almost 10% since my October report, but there is still room for further gains. For right now, I think $85 per share is the intrinsic value based on forecasted fundamentals. On a price/book basis, 2.44 is justified.WDC data by YChartsLooking at my last report, I am dissatisfied with my valuation of Western. I think the 5-year average valuations reflect an unconsolidated industry. In this report, I use the forecasted fundamentals to incorporate industry consolidation. Also, I use the P/B ratio as the appropriate valuation metric as EPS is volatile.I think Western's valuation will continue to benefit from industry consolidation, but the secular headwinds from mobile and cloud should keep a lid on the valuation. I'm going to continue to monitor the company's profitability. But for right now, I'm bullish on Western.Recent DevelopmentsOn October 17, 2013, Western acquired Virident Systems, Inc., a provider of server-side flash storage solutions for virtualization, database, cloud computing and webscale applications; the company continues to enhance its competitive position in flash storage.Fundamental AnalysisFrom a business perspective, the industry consolidation could be driving the valuations. Also, Western is investing heavily in NAND technology. Those are both positive for the valuations and the market is correct in bidding up the valuations of the company. Additionally, the hard drive industry is strong relative to the PC market with management forecasting flat revenues in the fiscal second quarter.During the fiscal first quarter, sales of enterprise SSDs increased 51% relative to the year-ago quarter. I expect SSDs to be a growth area in fiscal 2014. Also, I think non-PC sales will become a larger portion of totaled revenues, which should approximately offset weakness in PC; the PC market should stabilize in fiscal 2014/2015.The net revenue y/y decline in the fiscal first quarter is attributable to the competitive pricing pressure and the change in product mix. I think those two factors could continue to hinder net revenue growth. But as non-PC sales becomes a larger portion of revenues and the PC market stabilizes, the ASP impact on net revenues should decline. Consequently, I think we could see net revenue growth in fiscal 2015 and/or fiscal 2016.WDC Return on Equity (TTM) data by YChartsI'm worried about the declining return on assets, equity, and invested capital, and asset turnover. This could be a sign of a maturing company, competitive pressures, or both. I'm leaning towards maturing company, but I'll pay careful attention to the competitive environment. Additionally, Western is becoming less efficient.Looking forward, there are a couple significant risks to the results of operations. Mobile computing presents a risk as smartphones and tablets do not possess HDDs. Also, cloud computing presents a risk to the results of operations as electronic data storage becomes more efficient. These are secular headwinds within the industry that Western's management will have to effectively combat.Relative to the storage industry, Western is one of the better investment opportunities, by revenues growth.ValuationI'm going to use price/book value to assess the relative valuation. EPS is highly variable; consequently, I think P/B is a more appropriate model. Also, shareholders' equity is roughly equal to liquid assets. But the share repurchases may distort the historical comparisons. Relative to P/E, I prefer the P/B value model for this valuation. Western is trading modestly below my intrinsic value estimate.The book value per share is $34.97 and the market price per share is $78.97. Thus, the P/B is 2.258. To measure the sensitivity of value to a goodwill writedown, I will calculate the tangible P/B, assuming $0 of goodwill. The tangible P/B is 3.005; P/B increased 33%.I examined also the off-balance sheet assets and liabilities and the composition of financial assets and liabilities. As of September 27, 2013, there were no off-balance sheet liabilities disclosed. Also, most of the financial assets are measured at fair value without the need for significant estimates by management. Thus, I think that shareholders' equity closely represents net assets.Previously, I valued Western Digital using the 5-year average valuations; the result was an intrinsic value of $44.90 per share. In this valuation, I will try to incorporate the shifts in the industry.WDC Price to Book Value data by YChartsI estimated a range of potential justified P/B value ratios using the 5-year median ROE of 15.96%. I view Western as having a sustainable growth rate between 3.5% and 4%; consequently, the justified P/B is 2.44. I would accumulate below 2.15 and distribute at 2.91. So, Western is around intrinsic value, but there is some room for upside.Using the method of comparables, Western is around its intrinsic value, but it is slightly below the intrinsic value. The industry P/B is 2.5 and the P/B of the S&P 500 is 2.5. There is room for upside.I think that forecasting the fundamentals of the P/B ratio is a more appropriate valuation metric as the 5-year average valuations do not reflect current operations accurately.I'm going to assume that the book value per share remains constant. The previous trade would now have a stop loss at about the break-even level. If the price rises to the $85 per share level, the P/B ratio would be at the 2.4 level. This would be an ROI of about 18%, excluding commissions.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1894351,55482,2013-12-12T08:29:32-05:00,,"Flash memory maker SanDisk (SNDK) has had a terrific year so far with shares up around 60%. Driven by increased adoption of solid-state drives ((SSDs)), embedded memory products, and the presence of key customers such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), SanDisk's revenue and margins have improved considerably. The stock is now trading close to its 52-week high, but it hasn't run out of fuel yet.Solid performanceIt wasn't surprising when SanDisk posted terrific third-quarter numbers last month. Revenue and earnings topped consensus estimates, while outlook was impressive as well. SanDisk's revenue was up 28% from the year-ago period. Gross margin growth was even more impressive. SanDisk saw its non-GAAP gross margin improve to 50.1% in the quarter, a massive improvement from 31% in the year-ago quarter.SanDisk was able to achieve robust growth as it saw higher sales of its higher margin products. The company was able to strengthen its position in client and enterprise SSDs (partly due to its acquisition of SMART Storage Systems), and it also bolstered its retail channel in both developed and emerging markets.Solid movesSanDisk's 19-nanometer client SSDs, which were rolled out recently, are also gaining traction and the product has gained qualification at all the major PC makers. Moreover, SanDisk's enterprise SSDs have now gained qualification at six of the top seven original equipment manufacturers ((OEMs)).In addition, SanDisk is of the opinion that its acquisition of SMART Storage will help it scale up its enterprise SSD product architecture substantially. As such, management claims that SanDisk will be able to deliver more features, better performance, and greater reliability to its enterprise customers in the future.SanDisk is expecting rapid growth in its SSD business. The company believes that it will be able to exceed its growth target from this segment this year, and make up 25% of overall revenue in the next fiscal year.Great prospectsMobile product sales, which account for almost half of SanDisk's revenue, have also been going strong. The company's iNAND embedded flash offering has gained traction at mid- and low-tier smartphone makers. This is an important market. For example, the sub-$200 smartphone market is growing at a rapid pace, and this led research firm IDC to increase its mobile phone shipment growth forecast for 2013 to 7.3% from 5.8% earlier.Gartner is also of the opinion that mid-tier smartphones will be in good demand in mature markets while the low-end smartphones are gaining traction in the emerging markets. On the premium front, it is Apple that's aiding SanDisk's growth. According to Reuters, Apple accounted for 13% of SanDisk's revenue last year and was its biggest customer, and the launch of the latest iPhones acted as tailwinds.Sales of the iPhone 5s have been strong and helped Apple become the top smartphone seller in the U.S. in September, according to Counterpoint Research (via The Guardian). According to the firm, Apple was able to sell 4.8 million phones in the U.S. in just 10 days of September, grabbing 38% share of the market. The iPhone 5s was the top-selling device, followed by Samsung's Galaxy S4, while the cheaper iPhone 5c occupied the third spot.The momentum is expected to continue as Apple releases the devices in more countries. Apple recently rolled out the iPhone in 35 more countries across the globe. Also, it is being reported that sales of the iPhone 5c, which were slowing down earlier, are now catching up to the iPhone 5s. The 5c was being outsold by the premium 5s by a multiple of 3x in the U.S., as reported by Localytics. However, that ratio is now down to 1.9x, which bodes well for component suppliers.Hence, higher sales of the iPhone should continue driving SanDisk's top line. But that's not all. SanDisk had started supplying SSDs to Apple for the retina MacBook Pro earlier this year, which means that the company has room apart from iPhones to grow its business at Apple.Moving on, SanDisk expects that new technology trends will drive the need for storage. According to CEO Sanjay Mehrotra, ""...the introduction of 4K and 120 frames per second video capability, increasing adoption of burst mode in mobile devices and recent offerings from content providers that drive more usage of local storage are trends which bode well for the average capacity increases in smartphones.""Potential risksAn investment in SanDisk is not without risks. However, according to Equity Dimensions, the growth of cloud storage technology could be a threat for SanDisk.The cloud storage technology equips users and businesses with the flexibility of storing data and accessing it at their convenience. It is believed that cloud storage technology might pose a threat to the potential growth of flash memory consumption. In addition, the expected growth of 20%-25% in flash memory, according to Equity Dimensions, is lower than the historical growth rate as a result of cloud storage services such as iCloud and Dropbox.The growth in these services could hurt flash memory consumption in the future. But a potential upside might come in the form of higher sales of solid-state drives which are finding use in cloud storage.ConclusionThus, SanDisk seems pretty well-positioned to benefit from growth in storage and mobile computing.Moreover, despite its good run up this year, the stock is still not expensive. Its trailing P/E ratio of 18 is slightly below the industry average, while a forward P/E of just below 12 indicates that earnings growth is expected in the future. Also, the fact that SanDisk sports a dividend yield of 1.30% is an added attraction. Finally, given the company's prospects, one can count on the stock to reach new highs going forward.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1873271,34001,2013-12-03T08:32:20-05:00,,"Over the past few years, we've seen a fast escalation of interest in companies that manage big data and provide cloud storage and backup capabilities. While companies such as Carbonite (NASDAQ:CARB), IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) certainly make great investments on their own, investors have overlooked a key component of the future of the technologies they provide. Their increasing need for reliable storage will most directly affect hard disk drive (HDD) manufacturers.When it comes to the hard drive space, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) dominate the discussion--and for a good reason. These two companies are solid investments with great fundamentals and large investments in research and development. Not surprisingly, I will spend some time covering these two giants of the industry in this series, as well as some of the less-visible companies such as Fusion-io (NYSE:FIO) and OCZ Technology (NASDAQ:OCZ).However, I'd like to begin the series by analyzing the current revenue leader for solid state technology: SanDisk (SNDK). For this reason, I'll focus on SanDisk for the first part of this series.Before we get into the business fundamentals, it's important to recognize what solid state technology is and why it's the future of data storage. A solid state drive (SSD) is a hard drive with no moving parts, to put it simply. They provide three main advantages over normal drives that are still using spinning platters:Large businesses with data farms are mainly interested in SSDs because of their low power usage and low latency. Several technology blogs have reported that companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and Dropbox have already begun migrating to hybrid datafarms, using hard drives and solid state drives simultaneously for speed and cost effectiveness. As the world's thirst for big data increases, so will demand for solid state storage.Businesses aren't the only ones taking note of SSD technology, however. As these drives are becoming more affordable, mainstream consumers are beginning to take note. Computer manufacturers are beginning to offer SSDs as an upgrade feature in their products. In fact, as we'll see throughout this series, retail sales of solid state drives have seen immense growth, with some companies such as SanDisk, reporting a 200% increase in SSD sales over 2012 (Source: Q3 Earnings Call).There's no question that hard drives will be replaced by solid state drives eventually, just as LCD screens replaced clunky old CRT monitors. The question is, where can investors turn to take advantage of the changing market conditions?SanDiskSanDisk is a natural starting point for this series because they are the current leader in retail revenue in the flash storage industry. Consumers are familiar with the brand name because of their prevalence in the flash drive market, and this prevalence seems to be transferred well to larger forms of solid state storage. Revenue streams have been growing consistently over recent quarters, led by a 200% growth in SSD solutions according to their 2013 Stockholder Meeting Presentation:While OEM storage revenues are dwindling, it's important to note that SSD sales comprised 20% of the quarterly retail revenue for SanDisk (according to the Q3 Earnings Call) and they are rapidly growing.SanDisk is also focused on increasing its exposure to enterprise clients with its focus on complete vertical integration. They produce all hardware memory products, as well as the necessary management software for their use, in-house. This reduces cost and increases efficiency. Their recent acquisition of SMART Storage System also gives them access to the proprietary Guardian Technology which allows for better SSD management, leading to a longer lasting drive.During the Q3 earnings release, Sanjay Mehrotra (CEO), stated that they are ramping up research and investments for drives capable of serving special needs customers. For example, they are accelerating investment in ULLtraDIMM, a product aimed towards low latency uses such as high frequency trading. At the recent Flash Memory conference in Needham, MA, SanDisk revealed the difference in latency between the fastest group of SSDs currently available (PCIe SSDs) and their ULLtraDIMM interface:PCIe vs ULLtraDIMMThere's no question that SanDisk realizes the future of storage is the SSD market. They've pointed out in their guidance of 2014 that they expect 25% of their revenue to come from solid state storage. They've also stated that they expect a 2-6% growth in revenues quarter over quarter (between $1.65 billion and $1.725 billion) to finish the year beating 2013 guidance estimates.Investors should take note that SanDisk also made their first-ever dividend payment for Q2, and they have announced a dividend of $0.22 per share for Q3. In fact, their major expenditures in the most recent quarter included a dividend payment ($51 million), a share buyback ($1 billion) and the acquisition of Smart Technologies ($304 million), all good signs for a long-term investor. Most of the fundamentals for SanDisk make it a very desirable stock, and not surprisingly, institutional ownership is up significantly for 2013.While it's great to see increasing revenues, sales, and profits, SanDisk has a few red flags that investors should be aware of. One of the key red flags is that SanDisk seems to be expensive compared to other companies in its industry when looking at key ratios:All ratios except for price to free-cash-flow show a company trading at a premium to its industry. It's up to the investor to decide if it's presence as the market leader and innovator in the flash storage space are worth the premium. However, if an investor should decide to buy in, technical analysis shows that we may be seeing a temporary pullback.SanDisk ChartThe price has moved below the 20-day moving average, however the 20-day moving average is above the 50-day moving average for now. The RSI indicator is straddling its mid-line, as is the Ultimate oscillator. The MACD seems to show a slowing down of the upward trend so apprehensive investors may wait to see if the trend has changed or if this is simply a correction. For investors interested in more customization, SanDisk options contracts are available.It should be noted that technical analysis was simply used to gauge for a short-term pullback in price--it is NOT a tool that should be used to determine if a company is worth investing in for the long term.NOTE: While Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Samsung have both made significant strides in solid state technologies, I will not cover them in this series because of their inherent diversity of products and because their flagship products are in markets other than data storage. There are many more companies that produce solid state drives, however I limited my search to only include companies whose primary industry is hard drive manufacturing. I also limited my search to companies which are publicly traded on a US exchange.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in SNDK over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1862141,23479,2013-11-25T15:21:25-05:00,,"Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST), owned by Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC), started shipping its 6 terabyte (TB) Helium-filled storage drive, Ultrastar He6, earlier this month. According to HGST, the Helium drive consumes less power than both regular hard disk drives (HDDs) and solid state drives (SSDs), while requiring lower physical space. Enterprises with large data storage could see this as a viable option because these drives provide high efficiency storage while reducing the overall cost of ownership.The combined storage units shipped for PCs, laptops, smartphones, tablets, TVs, DVRs and enterprises was around 550 million units in 2012. According to an IHS iSuppli estimate, the number of Helium drive units shipped could reach around 100 million units in 2016. [1] The helium-filled drive could become a key driver for storage industry sales, especially in the enterprise segment, even if its sales don’t reach this optimistic estimate.We have a $72 price estimate for Western Digital, which is slightly below the current market price.What Are Helium-filled Disk Drives?Hard disk drives have spinning disks inside them that rotate at very high speeds (~5000RPM) during the course of their usage. The air inside the disks creates turbulence, causing a lot of heat to be generated. These new drives are sealed with helium in them instead of air. Helium, being seven times lighter than air, doesn’t cause as much turbulence. This allows the rotating discs to go up to 10,000 RPM without overheating. The Ultrastar He6 can, therefore, provide high input-output per second (IOPS) without losing efficiency, which is generally caused due to overheating.With considerably reduced turbulence inside the drive, the rotating disks can be packed closer by up to 50%, giving these storage drives a higher storage capacity than a regular disk drive of the same size. HGST built the Ultrastar He6 on the regular 3.5-inch form factor but with a storage capacity of 6TB compared to the standard capacity of 4TB to highlight this space effectiveness. Hitachi’s press release indicates that Helium drives can be submersed in water because they are sealed to trap Helium inside. This reduces the cooling costs even further since big data centers can simply use water for cooling the storage drives without having to use expensive cooling techniques.Helium Drive Market Size Solid State Drives, unlike regular HDDs or Helium-filled drives, have no moving mechanical parts since they are made up of integrated circuit (IC) assemblies. The use of electronic interfaces instead of mechanical components ensures less latency, low access time in reading or writing data and more resistance to physical shock compared to traditional drives. However, SSDs are much more expensive than traditional HDDs. Prices of HDDs have fallen considerably over the last few years and continue to do so, especially due to declining PC sales (Enterprise Market Lends Support To Seagate Amid Declining PC Sales). The average price of HDDs is around 5 cents per gigabyte (GB) and is on a decline. Comparatively, SSD prices, after an initial decline, have stabilized to around 70-80 cents per GB over the last few months.WDC hasn’t revealed the pricing of Helium drives yet, but we expect them to be cheaper than SSD, potentially in the 40-50 cents per GB range. In addition, the industry average capacity per unit shipped is ~800 GB. Since the average capacity per unit for enterprise storage is usually higher than that of the overall industry, we assume an average capacity per unit of 1,000 GB for the former. As already mentioned, the total units shipped could touch 100 million by 2016, but we’ll assume a conservative figure of 50 million.Based on these assumptions, the total Helium drive market could touch $20 billion by 2016 (i.e. 40 cents multiplied by 1,000 GB multiplied by 50 million units). Since Western Digital has a first mover advantage, it could grab a significant portion of the market.Enterprise Market TargetedThe Helium-filled drive will appeal to enterprise clients since it specifically addresses their concerns such as cooling costs, power consumption for data storage and storage density. Major companies like HP (NYSE:HPQ), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Huawei Unified Storage, Cerner (NASDAQ:CERN), Green Revolution Cooling and Code42 have been working with HGST, testing the product in its nascent stages.

1881171,48501,2013-12-05T17:49:40-05:00,,"I'm looking for demand for NAND flash solutions to continue to drive SanDisk's (SNDK) earnings growth. Specifically, the industry is forecasted to increase 50% between 2012 and 2016. I think demand for tablet, smartphone, and solid-state drive offerings will slow towards the end of the decade. Consequently, I view SanDisk as having a secular valuation tailwind.In the near term, SanDisk could underperform earnings expectations as the Street is forecasting 8.4% EPS growth in calendar 2014 after 207% EPS growth in calendar 2013. These would be excellent buying opportunities so long as the fundamental story remains intact. SanDisk operates in a volatile, competitive industry, which is subject to short-lasting fluctuations.SNDK PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsI think the current intrinsic value is $80.28 per share as the justified P/E ratio is 14.26, and the forward EPS is $5.63; I'm remaining bullish on SanDisk.Recent DevelopmentsFundamental AnalysisFrom 2008 to 2012, flash grew from a $13 billion industry to a $26 billion industry and is expected to grow to $38 billion in 2016. Within the flash market, SanDisk faces competition from Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) who is offering 3D NAND in 2014, which SanDisk plans to offer in 2015 and/or 2016. Additionally, SanDisk competes with EMC Corporation (EMC), Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC), Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX), Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP). Given the amount of competitors in the industry, the volatile supply and demand dynamic within the industry significantly impacts SanDisk's profitability.SNDK Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsRelative to those firms, SanDisk is a competitive investment from a profitability and growth rate perspective. Unadjusted, SanDisk has the third highest revenues growth rate. This could be a consequence of the firm's increased reliance on revenues from Asia and original equipment manufacturers (""OEM""). Or the decreased reliance on revenues from the U.S. and retailers. I view OEMs and Asia as attractive growth opportunities for SanDisk.For the sake of simplicity, the flash market is growing and SanDisk is competitive in the industry; this should drive earnings and intrinsic value growth. If there is weakness in the financial performance, I could view it as transient.ValuationTo value the common equity shares of SanDisk, I will use the multiplier models; I will use the S&P 500 and SanDisk's five-year average valuations as comparisons. At an intrinsic value of $80.28 per share, SanDisk is undervalued.SNDK data by YChartsAccording to The Fed Model, the justified P/E for the S&P 500 is 35.34. The forward P/E for the S&P 500 is 16.5. Thus, The Fed Model suggests that the S&P 500 is currently undervalued by 114%, which means I'm not comparing SanDisk to an overvalued asset. I estimate that SanDisk is trading at 12 times next twelve months earnings, which means that SanDisk is 37.5% undervalued relative to the S&P 500 on a forward basis.SanDisk's higher trailing twelve months P/E valuation relative to SanDisk's 5-year average valuation is partly attributable to a decline in the financial risks SanDisk equity investors face. Also, changes in the business mix to a higher growth and value composition of revenues explains part of the premium valuation. Consequently, I'm subjectively adjusting the 5-year average P/E valuation up by 15% to 14.26.Wall Street analysts are forecasting EPS of $5.22 for calendar 2013, which is 207% above 2012 EPS as 2012's Q2 was remarkably weak. The median 2014 EPS forecast is $5.66. Thus, the next twelve months median EPS forecast is $5.63. On a forward basis, I'm valuing shares of SanDisk using this model at $80.28, which is 1,900 basis points above the current share price.There are a couple of ways to look at the EPS forecasts. Bears might say that the EPS forecasts have increased substantially, which leaves less room for SanDisk to surprise to the upside. And bulls might respond that EPS growth inline with estimates would still produce an intrinsic value well above the market price. I'm going to take the bullish side of the argument as I believe the valuation has a secular tailwind.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1910311,23479,2013-12-20T16:11:23-05:00,,"Over the last few years, storage companies have witnessed a surge in sales from Solid State Drives (SSDs), with market leaders Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) generating improved revenues from these high-margin drives.The industry-wide shift is justified by a growing need for higher efficiency, longer-lasting drives and lower power consumption. Despite better performance, SSDs are unlikely to completely cannibalize traditional hard disk drives (HDDs), mainly because of the huge price gap between the two. [1] In an attempt to deliver economical substitutes to more expensive SSDs, Western Digital recently announced the launch of its Helium-filled drive and Seagate looks to explore the option of Shingled Magnetic Recording drives. WDC’s launch of its dual drive, the Black2, highlights a similar trend.Below we take a look at the viability of the dual drive and how it will affect our $72 price estimate for the companySolid State Drives Solid state drives have integrated circuit units that store data, unlike regular hard disk drives that have a rotating disk and a moving read/write head making them more prone to damage under physical shock. In addition, it is much faster to access and transfer data on the integrated circuit storage compared to a conventional rotating disk. The absence of moving parts also ensures that no noise is generated while using SSDs. Consequently, solid state drives consume less power than regular hard drives. All these reasons make SSDs a logical choice for replacing the traditional hard disk drives.Primary storage for tablets and smartphones requires drives that are fast, efficient and consume much less space. SSD flash drives are therefore ideal for portable handheld devices although they are much more expensive than traditional HDDs. Burgeoning sales of mobile devices, where SSDs are a priority, have helped shore up demand for solid state drives.Why Are Alternatives To SSDs Required?The main reason to introduce an alternative to SSDs is that they are sometimes too expensive for laptops and PCs. While smartphones and tablets do not really have an option given the portability concerns, non-mobile devices can generally do without an all-SSD option to keep manufacturing costs lower. Considering the comparatively lower margins, laptops and PCs are generally more sensitive to high-cost storage options than mobile devices. For example, while Apple commands margins of 30-40% on the 9.7″ iPad and 50-60% on the iPhone 5, the Macbook line has margins in the range of 20-30%.In this context, it is important to note that while solid state drives for both PCs and laptops cost around 80 cents per GB, regular HDDs are priced at anywhere between 7-8 cents per GB. [2] Even though the price per GB for both solid state drives and hard disk drives has declined over the years, the price differential between the two is likely to remain.Furthermore, the number of laptop and PC units shipped have shown a slight decline since the iPad was introduced in 2010. The widespread popularity of tablets and smartphones has caused a reduced dependence on PCs and laptops. SSDs are not expected to become cheaper than traditional hard disks, and a reduction in laptop and PC demand has seen storage drive manufacturers look for cost-effective alternatives.The Dual Drive – Best Of Both WorldsThe recently launched Western Digital Black 2 dual-drive has elements of both solid state drives as well as standard hard drives. The dual drive has a 120GB solid state drive and a separate 1TB hard drive. [3] This coupling gives end-users the discretion to store data in their preferred drive. Data that needs to be accessed frequently, or large files that need to be accessed at once, can be stored in the SSD. For example, installing the operating system on the SSD reduces the boot time and heavy games, programs and high definition content runs without lags. Smaller files such as work files, music and photos or data that isn’t very frequently accessed can be stored on the regular hard disk instead of the SSD.However, these drives should not be confused with the solid state hybrid drives (SSHD) launched by Western Digital, Seagate and Toshiba earlier this year. Those SSHDs make use of solid state memory only as cache memory for the device and use a regular hard disk as storage. There is no dedicated solid state storage space like in the dual drive. While this makes the SSHD faster for access than regular HDDs, there is no major advantage in reading or accessing bulk data. [4]Market Opportunity For Western DigitalThe Black2, with a combined storage of more than 1,100GB, is priced at $300, which is roughly the same price as a Seagate 240GB SDD for laptops. The pricing gives WDC an edge over all solid state drives because end-users get more space, higher flexibility for data storage and better performance for the same investment.The dual drive could become popular with the target customer base of programmers, gamers and video editors – basically users that have a large data storage requirement but still require high speed access. Subsequently, the Black2 could result in a slowdown in the rate of adoption of pure SSDs. [5] We also expect the dual drives to become more popular than hybrid drives considering the added benefits of the dual storage option.However, it is difficult to assess the direct impact that dual drives will have on WDC’s valuation because the product is new in the market. While the Black2 should indeed help WDC grow its production of laptop and PC HDD units, the drives could also cannibalize the company’s pure HDD sales and in the process increase the average selling price per unit of HDDs. Western Digital should experience first-mover’s advantage for the dual drive until competition moves in. A 3-4% increase in market share of PC and laptop HDD segment in the long run and even a conservative 5% increase in the overall average price per unit of laptop and PC HDDs could lead to a 3% upside to our price estimate.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
1881871,25120,2013-12-06T07:32:02-05:00,,"Investors in Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) saw a boost on Wednesday after analysts at Morgan Stanley issued a bullish research report on the firm.While I agree that Western Digital is attractive at current valuation multiples, given its solid strategy and strong historical performance, I would be a bit more cautious. The solid momentum so far this year, combined with the cyclical nature of the industry make a correction always among the possibilities.As such I continue to be optimistic about the long term prospects, yet I would be more cautious in the short to medium term.Morgan Stanley Continues To Be PositiveAnalyst Katy Huberty at Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) upgraded her rating on Western Digital from ""Equal-Weight"" to ""Overweight"". At the same time, Huberty reiterated her $85 price target, suggesting some 12-13% upside from Tuesday's levels.Huberty notes that cloud computing adoption accelerates faster than expected. As a result of these developments, Western Digital offers a better risk/reward ratio at current levels than previously anticipated. Given the very strong momentum so far this year, it seems to me that the market already largely priced in these developments.ValuationWestern Digital opened its books for the first quarter of the fiscal 2014 at the end of October. The company ended the quarter with $4.87 billion in cash and equivalents. Total debt stood at $2.17 billion, resulting in a net cash position of $2.7 billion.First quarter revenues came in at $3.80 billion, down 5.7% on the year before. Net earnings came in at $495 million, down 4.6% compared to the same period in the fiscal 2013. Note that last year's first quarter was very strong on the back of the floodings in Thailand.Trading around $77.50 per share, the market values Western Digital at $18.3 billion. This values operating assets of the firm at $15.6 billion, equivalent to 1.0 times annual revenues for the fiscal 2013 and 16 times annual earnings. Note that hefty charges in the fourth quarter resulted in depressed earnings. Excluding these charges, the company trades around 10 times annual earnings.Western Digital currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 1.5%.Some Historical PerspectiveLong-term investors in Western Digital have seen great returns. Shares have steadily risen from levels around $7 per share in 2004 to highs of $40 in 2008. Shares fell back to lows of $10 later that year but quickly recovered to levels around $40 per share.After witnessing very solid returns so far this year, with shares trading up over 80% year to date, shares are currently trading at all time highs just below $80 per share.Between the fiscal year of 2010 and 2013, Western Digital has increased its annual revenues by a cumulative 55% to $15.4 billion. Earnings have been volatile and came in between $700 million and $1.6 billion in recent years.Investment ThesisWestern Digital has done very well in recent times, despite the decline in the personal computer market. While hard disk drive demand is down, demand for hard drive by cloud storage firms continues to be very solid.As a result, the total addressable market in terms of units has declined in recent months, yet Western Digital has boosted its market share from 30% to 45% since 2010. While technology firms are typically plagued by lower average selling prices going forwards, the demand for high end devices resulted in average selling prices of $58 over the past quarter, thereby being relatively stable.Back in September, I last took a look at the prospects for the firm. I concluded that long term appeal remains after the company announced another strategic acquisition. At the time, Western Digital bought Virident Systems for $685 million in cash, boosting its presence in the SSD market. Note that this marked the third acquisition of Western Digital in just three months time.The deal shows the company's commitment to the solid state drive market, as well as its intentions to bolster growth and secure its competitive position. The strong financial position, strong strategic actions and appealing valuation, made me optimistic at the time. Ever since, shares have risen another 20% to current levels approaching $78 per share.While the current circumstances look very appealing, I would hold off on initiating a long position at current levels. Given the solid momentum so far this year and the cyclical nature of the industry, I would remain a little bit more cautious than analysts at Morgan Stanley.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The stock is up 69% YTD and trading near the 52-week high. Is WDC still a buy after such a big run?Hard disk drive technology has dramatically improved over the past decade, enabling these drives to hold ever-larger amounts of data. However, disk drives are being replaced by flash drives, which have no moving parts, consume less power and are much smaller. A much better fit for today's smartphones, tablet computers, and laptop computers. Western Digital acquired three flash drive companies over the past five months, Virident, sTec and VeloBit.During the most recent quarter, Western Digital shipped 62.6 million hard drives at an average selling price of $58. Although the reported shipment was up from $59.9 million sequentially, it was up only marginally from the same quarter a year earlier with a shipment of $62.5 million. However, the average selling price for the quarter was down from $60 million in the previous quarter, and $62 million in the year-ago quarter. More than half of the quarter's revenues came from non-PC applications, while the company reported $106 million in revenue contribution from the Enterprise Solid State Drive segment, which increased from $104 million in the previous quarter and $70 million contributed in the year-ago quarter. Shares of WDC are still trading below long-term resistance, even after moving up over 13% in the last three months, based on the real-time trading report published by Stock Traders Daily.The move into the Solid State Drive space puts Western Digital up against bigger competition like Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) and SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK) Western Digital continues to manufacturer the older hard disk drives along with the newer hybrid drives and Solid State Drives. The Virident acquisition cost Western Digital 685 million in cash, but Virident makes the fast growing PCIe card, which is expected to grow at 31% annually over the next three years. Speaking of growth, Virident as a company saw its revenue increase by 200% on a year-to-year basis. Virident helped high profile companies like LinkedIn Corp (NYSE:LNKD) fine tune their service by allowing users to better identify people they should follow and provided analysis that delivered a better customer experience.Completion of the sTec acquisition follows company's recent purchase of VeloBit, an advanced SSD caching software company, and now the acquisition of Virident, an innovative provider of server-side flash storage solutions. Collectively these strategic moves help expand Western Digital's presence in the Enterprise Solid State space.The recent acquisitions that the company made should better position the company to focus on its non-PC related revenues. The future looks strong for Western Digital with growing demand for higher priced, lower storage Solid State Drives. However, competition is will be more difficult and it may take some time to transition all the parts from recent acquisitions into one. The stock is up over 160% in the last two years, and smart money will be watching the price. The stock is getting closer to a test of long-term resistance. According to rule, we are sellers at resistance, and as long as the stock remains below resistance, we expect lower levels and a test of support. Based on the real-time trading report published by Stock Traders Daily, WDC is a sell/short at resistance, with risk controls in place if resistance breaks higher.Stock Traders Daily has been providing comprehensive market analysis and correlated trading strategies since January, 2000, the virtual peak of the Internet Bubble.

1831992,54342,2013-11-12T11:05:46-05:00,,"In the last one year, there has been a considerable appreciation in the price of the shares of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). The price has doubled in a year on account of consistent profits and improved gross margin. Western Digital has been riding on the sale of hard drives that has been picking up in the past decade.Figure: Movement in the share price of Western Digital in the last one yearUnfortunately, the storage industry is seeing a massive change of late and this could very well depreciate the profitability of the company. This becomes quite an intricate situation for investors interested in the share, as the performance of the company has been extraordinary in the past year but a serious threat from the flash storage industry has the potential to reverse the upswing in the following months. The company has managed to keep pace with the demands of the market by targeting companies specializing in the flash technology and a lot will depend on how the new acquisitions perform in determining the one-year equity market return of Western Digital.Interpreting The Quarterly ResultsWestern Digital in the recent quarter reported revenue of $3.8 billion and a net income of $495 million, or $2.05 per share for its first fiscal quarter that ended on September 27, 2013. While revenue was considerably reduced by 5% from a year ago, net income was higher by 4.85% on account of sales of high-margin products. The projections in the core business of Western may not be very promising considering the fact that the company shipped only 62.6 million hard drives compared to the 62.5 million units a year ago.Figure: Volume (in units) and market share (in %) of Western Digital since Q2'10The figure above ratifies the fact that the hard drive storage market has been flat since Q4'12. Western Digital has been maintaining consistency in the volume and market share but it cannot rely on high margin sales of the same set of products in this segment if it wants to deliver profits that are in tune with its past. As the sale of personal computers continues to decline, it is inevitable that the company will look to gradually replace its hard disk business with higher-margin storage products and fast-growing cloud storage firms. This has been the recent strategy for the company as it looks for possible targets that are into the flash drive segment. Such a strategy not only diversifies the business of this company but it also enables Western Digital to tap into a high growing, lucrative but competitive market.What The Latest Acquisitions Have In Store?While it would be almost impossible to replicate the dream run in the bourse, investors might be wary of the recent acquisitions that Western Digital is banking heavily upon. Five months down the lane, the company has acquired three companies in the flash drive industry. These are Virident, sTec and VeloBit and they have shown tremendous potential in the past. Take the case of Virident that saw its revenue rise by 200% in a year and if the demand for PCIe cards grows in tune with the projected 31% mark, there could be further improvements in the gross margins for Western from this new product line. sTec on the other hand has not been able to perform too well but there could be a complete turnaround for the company as Western Digital forays its baby-steps into the lucrative solid state drives market.A very common feature for these companies has been their recent upsurge on account of the alteration in computing patterns right away from Personal Computers to laptops and smartphones to tablets. As long as these industries thrive, the recent mergers of Western Digital should not face any sort of problem in delivering the anticipated outcome. These acquisitions may be the sole factor upon which the investors can pin their hope on if they want to see this company replicate yet again their one year ascent on the stock market.A Year From NowWestern Digital is trading at $70.23 which is very close to its 52-week high. Since the share price has doubled in one year, it is expected that unless the company delivers extraordinary profits, the share price may cool in the coming months. High dependence on the sale of hard disk drives (a market in which it commands around 46%) may also dampen the bottom line considering the fact that the demand in this segment has not been promising. Inorganic growth from its acquisitions is also subject to various risks. Companies like sTec, Inc. have been operating in lucrative segments but have fallen prey to intense competition. Its revenue has been dwindling since 2011 and has already halved in the first quarter this year from a year earlier. While Western Digital is expecting to turn around the fortunes of this company, any wrong strategy may backfire. The following year should see the company in a transition phase as it looks to diversify its product portfolio and reduce its dependency on the disk drives. A lot will depend on the smartphone industry that will fuel the need for flash based technologies that the acquisitions of Western cater to. For investors expecting returns to the tune of what it delivered in a year would be too optimistic an assumption considering the stagnation in the chip industry and the emergence of new players seeking to intensify the competition.The Wise MoveThe next few months could see the stock remain at its current level and an earnings missing could see a steep drop in the share price. While upward movement has limited scope on account of an overheated price, the cooling effect may be more pronounced. Investors still seeking opportunities may want to understand the storage industry and the product class of Western Digital in order to understand the long-term implications of the strategies adopted by the company. Unfortunately, the technology sector is fraught with volatility and the possibility of new products from competitors makes long-term returns a very risky bet.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Analysts at EurEx Consulting.

1764992,48501,2013-10-23T14:43:47-04:00,,"Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) is reporting fiscal first quarter earnings in the coming days. That said, since the last time I wrote about Western Digital, the share price has increased. I still think the valuations are pricey for long-term investors, but there is a trade to be made.From a business perspective, the industry consolidation could be driving the valuations. Also, Western is investing heavily in NAND technology. Those are both positive for the valuations and the market is correct in bidding up the valuations of the company. But, at this point, I would not put money to work long term in Western Digital.I think this is more of a trade. There may be a throwback at some point in the coming days or weeks. The play here is to use a minor correction to get long with a trailing stop loss starting at the $62 level. Besides the always present risks, the asset-specific risk is of a disappointing earnings report that leads to a sell off below the $64 per share level.I'm attempting to profit from industry consolidation and technological advancement without risking too much capital if I'm wrong and the stock is overvalued. This may not be a one-and-done trade; it may be a bullish campaign. I would like this to be a one quarter ROI story, but it'll probably be a two or three quarters investment. The worst case scenario is that I'm going to have to stick with this trade, assuming the fundamentals remain intact, for a year to three years.In this report, there is a section on the relative performance, recent events, valuations and portfolio management of Western Digital. Micron Technologies (NASDAQ:MU), SanDisk (SNDK) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) are used as peer company comparisons.Relative PerformanceNear term, the share price of Western Digital could continue to trade to the upside as the recent relative performance has lagged the other electronic storage device manufacturers. In technical terms, the share price of the Irvine, California,-based Western Digital Corporation is breaking out to the upside.Recent DevelopmentThe industry is consolidating and shifting to new technologies. This could be positively impacting the valuations, which may be shifting to new sustainable levels. Consequently, I do not want to risk a long-term investment on a stock that looks reasonably priced on an absolute basis but looks expensive on a relative basis.ValuationsIn this section, I will use the multiplier models to value the common equity shares of Western Digital. Previously, I used a combination of the multiplier models and discounted cash flows. The equity remains overvalued.Using the five-year average valuations, Western Digital Corporation's intrinsic value is $44.90. So, Western Digital is overvalued according to this model, but is it asset specific or is the industry trading at pricey valuations?WDC PE Ratio TTM data by YChartsSeagate, SanDisk and Micron are also pricey using the five-year average valuation model. The current valuations could reflect a perceived change in the fundamentals of the businesses; that change in perception could be justified or it could be another instance of investor mis-perception.If you look at Western Digital's valuations on a time-series basis, those valuations also suggest overvaluation. On an absolute basis, 18 times earnings and 2 times book is not exorbitant.The industry valuations may be partly attributable to industry consolidation. Based on this analysis and previous analysis, Western Digital Corporation is too aggressively priced for investors. But, traders using excellent portfolio and risk management skills may find Western to be an attractive long-equity trade.Portfolio ManagementIn this section, I will examine the technicals and the return distribution. Also, I will present the 52-week share price forecast. At the end is the answer to the question, how do I trade Western Digital?WDC data by YChartsWestern Digital is in a bull market of intermediate-term degree following an intermediate-term bear market; the intermediate term bull market is part of a bull market of primary degree. The intermediate term bull market is not showing any obvious signs of weakening; in other words, there is confirmation. The share price should have additional upside.In terms of the return distribution, it is favorable for investors. The compound monthly growth rate is 2.5%. Also, the skewness is positive and the distribution is not leptokurtic.The 52-week price forecast is $57, which means that the share price is trading above trend. In other words, there is potential for a bear market of primary degree.But, given that the intermediate-term uptrend could be in its early stages, getting bullish on a minor correction is the play. The initial trailing stop loss level is $62.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1720252,54502,2013-09-30T07:44:10-04:00,,"The storage market is growing and companies that are at the forefront of this industry have witnessed rapid growth. Flash Memory Drives & Solid State Drives (NYSE:SSD) are witnessing huge demand due to their application in various devices and cloud storage.SanDisk (SNDK) is one of the leading manufacturers and suppliers of flash memory storage drives. The company reported its second-quarter earnings in July and recorded revenue of $1.48 billion, which was up an impressive 43% from last year.The burgeoning demand for SanDisk's products and the increase in price of its micro SD cards contributed to the rise in margins. Most mobile phone manufacturers now provide a card slot in their devices, leading to increased demand for memory cards. Customers looking to store more data have led to the growth of micro SD cards, pushing up demand in the process.SanDisk has a diverse product portfolio of embedded solutions. Its products are used in various devices like smartphones, tablets, digital cameras, etc. It is also one of the leading providers of USB flash drives and solid state drives. SSDs are seeing good demand due to their application in data centers and servers.SanDisk is looking to bolster its position in this segment and it recently acquired Smart Storage for $307 million. This acquisition will improve SanDisk's position in the enterprise storage solutions market for SSDs. SanDisk will also be providing solutions to a wider spectrum of customers as it will be able to tap a larger market in enterprise SATA products.The future is brightSanDisk is looking to make the most of the SSD market. The cloud market is driving SSD demand through data centers and servers. As mentioned earlier, SanDisk's acquisition of Smart Storage will be a key factor in driving sales in this segment. In the SSD market, SanDisk estimates growth of 25% in 2014 and the company has positioned itself well to execute this growth through its latest acquisition.Even analysts are quite optimistic about the company's growth. SanDisk's earnings are estimated to grow at a CAGR of 25% for the next five years. Hence, at a trailing P/E of just under 21 and with a dividend yield of 1.5%, SanDisk looks like a solid investment proposition.Competitors - Sony and SamsungSony's in-house development can be a concern:Sony (NYSE:SNE) is one company capable of challenging SanDisk on various fronts. Sony has a diverse product portfolio and is the leading competitor of SandDisk in flash memory storage devices.Sony Mobile, a subsidiary of Sony, has significantly contributed to the sales growth of the company. Sony is confident of its MP&C (Mobile products and Communication) division's prospects. The reason behind this is simple as in the first quarter, this segment recorded impressive revenue growth of 36.2% as compared to the year-ago quarter.In recent years, Sony has released various models of premium smartphones which did not have any external storage slots. This hindered sales of companies such as SanDisk that manufacture storage memory. The integration of storage devices helped Sony increase its margins and boost its own in-house demand.After its recent success in smartphones, Sony further plans to expand its portfolio with more smartphones and tablets. This means that there will be higher in house consumption of memory cards at Sony and take some wind out of SanDisk's sales.Samsung making moves:Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) is one of the leading manufacturers of smartphones and is also the global leader in the memory business. Despite Apple being its competitor in the smartphone segment, it still pays Samsung a substantial amount every year for various components (processors and memories).Smartphone components manufactured by Samsung generate sizable revenue for the company. Samsung's memory product portfolio mainly comprises of NAND flash memory chips and SSDs.In July 2013, it revealed 840 EVO, a high performance SATA-based SSD which can store up to 1TB of data. For integration into the 840 EVO, Samsung started manufacturing 10-nanometer 128 GB NAND flash memories in April 2013. This is the industry's most compact high performance memory, used by the 840 EVO.TakeawayEven though the PC market is fading, SSDs are a bright spot in the storage market. According to IHS, the SSD market is forecasted to be worth $10.9 billion by the end of 2013. With a CAGR of 34.7% estimated between 2011 and 2016, the SSD market could reach $21 billion in revenue by 2015.The following factors are driving SSD growth:1. SSDs replacing HDDs in new generation Notebooks and Ultrabooks. 2. Price erosion of NAND has made SSDs more affordable and hence leading to higher demand.3. Big data requirement in data centers is also driving SSD growth.SanDisk is well-positioned in this market through its product innovations and acquisitions. The company is also trading at an inexpensive trailing P/E multiple and analysts are expecting solid growth going forward. Hence, SanDisk looks like a good bet at current prices.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1708542,24607,2013-09-23T12:21:02-04:00,,"Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) are in a highly competitive and mature segment of the technology industry. Their main products, hard disk drives, sold to original equipment manufacturers, are characterized by unstable and unpredictable product demand; rapid technological changes and product obsoleteness; rapid imitation and market saturation; price and margin erosion; and a constant threat from alternative products. Nonetheless, the two companies have survived and thrived. And Wall Street has taken notice, as the stocks of both companies have outpaced the S&P500 by a wide margin. How did they do it?By acquiring ailing and genuine competitors; and by forging collaborations with customers and competitors.Acquiring ailing competitors allowed both companies to amass the right scale and market share fending off price erosion. meanwhile, the acquisition of genuine competitors allowed them both to expand into emerging market segments. Seagate Technology, for instance, acquired Conner Peripherals in 1996, Maxtor in 2006, and Samsung's hard drive business in 2011. Western Digital acquired Read-Rite Corporation (2003), Komag (2007), Hitachi Global Technologies in (2011), and Virident Systems (2013).That's how the two companies managed to amass a near 87 percent of the market, with combined revenues of $30 billion dollars; and to expand into storage industries like flash memory, an emerging market segment of the disk drive industry.List of AcquisitionsSource: Corporate reportsMarket Shares for HDSource: Backupworks.comSeagate's And Western Digital's FinancialsSource: Finance.yahoo.comThe second strategy employed by both Seagate and Western Digital was forging collaboration with customers and competitors for the promotion of storage products. In 2008, for instance, Seagate forged a collaboration agreement with HarmanBecker for Automotive Media Server Applications Using D.A.V.E.(NYSE:TM) Technology. In 2012, Seagate announced a cloud storage business alliance to target engineering and marketing at cloud. In 2013, Western Digital forged a collaboration agreement with SanDisk to develop hybrid disk drives, known as SSHDs-a fast-moving market. In the same year, Seagate, HGST, Toshiba and Western Digital team up to form The Storage Products Association (NYSE:SPA) to promote hard drive technology.Which stock is a better bet for the future?It is hard to decide, as the two companies display similar financials and market shares. Nonetheless, I would bet on Western Digital, as it is better positioned to benefit from the fast-growing flash memory disk market.A few words of caution: Winning through acquisitions and collaborations has its own limits. Acquisitions may become increasing expensive, while collaborations may turn sour. That's why I would be very careful in investing in the two stocks, especially after the strong run up in the last twelve months.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1750712,55232,2013-10-17T10:06:47-04:00,,"SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) is a well known global leader in the manufacturer and sale of flash and solid state hard drives and memory storage devices, is competing capably with market darling Micron Technologies (NASDAQ:MU), and recently collaborated with Toshiba to build a $4 billion dollar plant in Yokkaichi, Japan. The company has seen 52-week highs coming into this earnings season, with a $62 price tag pushing the upper bound of the envelope. Investors will be interested by the amount of support the stock has seen, as large volume has developed a solid base ahead of the Q3 earnings report slated to come after markets closed yesterday. The technicals are in place for a large upside, and the corporate guidance has already raised estimates once this year. All of this information begs the question: with a SanDisk earnings report in the offing, is this company a buy?Corporate ColorThe company has a diverse product line, with multiple partnerships in the development and promotion of a series of microchips and flash drives, and now wireless flash devices, and has seen strong demand for the solid state drives it has recently brought to market. Furthermore, management seems to be making other quality decisions with the announcement of a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase plan for the current quarter, and an additional $2.5 billion in share buybacks over time, as well as announcing the offering of a $0.225 dividend, further increasing the value of SNDK to its shareholders.Technical ClarityThe fundamental support for the company can be seen in its chart, most notably the number of times the price level has tested that $63 range and then fallen to below $60. Recently a reaction to the report of a fire at a plant owned by Chinese semiconductor manufacturer Hynix boosted the price mildly, and volume for the trades after the incident have been strong as the RSI hasn't dropped below 50 this month. This case for strong support above the $60 level suggests that a new floor has been established for this stock price, and any positive news will push the company's valuation higher.A History of Underselling SuccessThe company has a history of beating earnings as well, having done so the past 3 quarters by an average of 30%. This says two things about SanDisk corporate guidance: primarily that it undersells the company's ability to perform, and secondarily, that management has a history of providing upside surprises in the earnings reports. This combination of features leads and investor to believe that there is a roughly 1 in 3 chance that SanDisk WON'T beat the estimates provided by the market for its Q3 performance. This also equates to a total revenue of somewhere between $1.7 and $1.83 billion, which will drive the corporate valuation to somewhere around the $72 price level. This assessment is in line with the price target for the firm from multiple analysts who value it somewhere in the 16.8 to 17 billion range, or $70 to $75 on a per share basis.The answer is clearly a resounding yes, as there appears to be constant support in both the retail market and technical aspects of the stock price. This possibility of strong movement, potentially 20% to the upside in the near term, will come on the heels of corporate earnings and production increases, making SanDisk a buy, even in the wake of its recent highs.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in SNDK over the next 72 hours.

1739472,55382,2013-10-10T16:03:34-04:00,,"Since the HDD industry consolidated back in 2011-2012 when Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) acquired Hitachi GST and Seagate Technologies PLC (NASDAQ:STX) acquired Samsung's HDD business, the industry landscape has changed significantly. After the 2011 floods in Thailand that severely damaged HDD manufacturing facilities, prices of hard disk drives rose dramatically. Many claimed that inflated prices would plunge when capacity was brought back online, but they didn't. A de-facto duopoly had been formed and neither WD nor Seagate wanted to slash prices. And yet, a weakness of PC sales harmed the HDD TAM and consequently the duopoly revenues.The TAM was hurt so much that now WDC ships almost the same amount of drives it shipped in Q3-2011, before it acquired Hitachi. Although PC sales are plunging, exponential growth of data spurs new data centers that have massive storage needs. Let's take a look at WD and Seagate shipment data for the past 11 quarters.While unit shipments are stagnant, gross margins and ASP are much higher these days thanks to the help of the HDD duopoly.Although the market took some time to react to this fundamental change in the industry both companies' stock has risen more than 160% for Seagate and more than a 100% for Western Digital since January 2012. Both companies trade at a P/E of less than 10 on their pro-forma earnings. With all the information about the exponential growth of data, why aren't these companies valued with at least a P/E of 15? The answer is simple. Realized growth. As a rough rule of thumb, a PEG ratio of 1 means a company's growth is valued fairly. The big exposure to PCs and the lack of exposure to the mobile markets anchors the companies' revenues and profits in a close to constant level, thus the market values those companies at a lower P/E ratio.Where's the Growth?A lot was said about the so called ""death of HDDs"" and ""the rise of SSDs."" While I think the PC market will never go back to what it was in the past, it is way too early to talk about the death of the HDD. The price difference between a SSD GB and a HDD GB makes data center builders prefer HDDs for anything that isn't mission-critical. Most of the data we create becomes ""cold data,"" which means that most of it will never be accessed again. Yes, that forgotten video you made about your cat that is stored on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) servers just doesn't justify being stored on flash.WD and Seagate have both claimed over the past year that the near-mid term future lies in SSHDD or hybrid HDDs that use a small amount of flash, mainly for cache purposes with an HDD, thus gaining the speed advantage from the NAND and the cheap capacity advantage from the HDD. In the past few months we witnessed a flow of news about the prospects of hybrid HDDs in tablets. Even Seagate CEO Steve Luczo was heard talking about these prospects in the past few months.Seagate even demoed a tablet carrying an HDD. Before I'll move on with this article I want to comment about those who regularly claim that 500GB is just too much for you. As time passes, our minds can't perceive the amount of data we will need to store in the future. At one time in the not so distant past, everybody thought that 5MB was much more than anyone would ever need. I guess that 10-15 years ago even you thought that 5GB was way too much for you. Think about that again. I want to demonstrate the logic for the use of HDDs in tablets and then try to estimate the impact on WD and Seagate's business performance and financials.Does It Make Sense?Today we consumers suffer the most from the use of SSDs in tablets. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other tablet market leaders make a lot of profit from selling us small amounts of storage for a ridiculous price premium.The math shows us we pay $100 for the first 16GB addition (the default model is 16GB), and another $100 for an addition of 32GB more. The BOM shows us it costs the manufacturer, in this case Apple, about $16 to put in the tablet another 16GB, or just over $1 per GB. We pay for each extra GB (from the 16th GB to the 32nd GB) about $6.25 that comes up to more than 83% in gross margin on the storage part of the tablet, definitely a good business for the manufacturers. What is the alternative? Here it is.For $89 OEMs can build a tablet with 500GB of capacity. A tablet manufacturer can now lower its cost per GB to $0.18. Then, the manufacturer can charge us consumers about $0.36 per GB and still get 50% of gross margin on the storage part of the tablet while increasing the value proposition a lot, which can fuel volume sales. This is a strategy I believe many tablet manufacturers that want to take market share will adopt. This is what you can store on 500GB.I believe we will start seeing high storage capacity tablets hitting the shelves in the near future. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is launching the Surface 2 and Surface 2 Pro with up to 512GB of flash on October 29th. Yes you read it right, 512GB of flash. The Surface 2 Pro with 64GB is priced at $899 and the same tablet carrying 512GB of flash is priced at $1799 or $900 more. Those who'll buy the 512GB Surface 2 Pro will pay about $2 per extra GB (from the 64th GB to the 512GB). Manufacturers like Samsung, for example, which sells the Samsung Tab 3 for $299 with 16GB of storage, could use the 5mm SSHDD and offer a similar tablet with 500GB of storage for $459. A price point that I think will appeal to most ""storage hungry"" consumers.For those of you that are interested in comparing the performance of this 5 mm SSHDD to an SSD can read here.What is the Impact on TAM?The adoption of HDDs by the tablet industry could be a game changer for both WD and Seagate. I assume both companies will share the market for tablet HDDs at a 50/50 split. Also, I assume this big storage capacity tablet market will start as a niche and slowly take over the entire tablet market as the standard. Let's take a look at the PC and tablet markets' shipments forecast.To get a clear picture, I did a side by side market size comparison.Assumptions: PC HDD prices will decline 5% y/y and tablet HDD prices will remain stable. Tablet HDDS will have a 10% market share of the total tablet market in 2014 and will increase gradually.ConclusionIf the tablet story unfolds like I demonstrated both Western Digital and Seagate could experience growth in the next few years. The PC trend coupled with the future tablet business could support healthy growth, especially if you bring enterprise HDDs into the equation. With WD and Seagate valued at a P/E of less than 10 on their last annualized quarter pro-forma earnings, I think both stocks might have significant upside. Of course, we need to closely monitor this developing story. Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1729182,48501,2013-10-04T11:51:13-04:00,,"SanDisk Corporation (SNDK), the maker of electronic data storage equipment, is trading near its 52-week high. The company has a market capitalization of roughly $15 billion and is up about 42% year-to-date. The last time that I wrote about SanDisk, I said the range to get bullish on shares is the $47-$57 range. The share price dipped below $55 and is now trading at $61.54. So, assuming that $57 was the purchase price, the investor would be up about 8% in just under a quarter. Moving on, SanDisk recently reported fiscal second quarter earnings.SanDisk reported excellent second quarter earnings on strong top-line growth. The company also re-paid debt during the period. Relative to my forecast, SanDisk reported slightly better than expected revenue, and the operating margin was higher than my conservative estimate. Consequently, I'm going to increase my forecast for this fiscal year.I think 2013 revenue should be in the $5.8 billion to $6.2 billion range with operating income in the $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion range and net income in the $600 million to $900 million range.I remain bullish on the common equity shares of SanDisk. The stop loss level is now the $57 per share level. In this report, I'm going to analyze a peer group's asset utilization, financial performance and valuations.Asset UtilizationAsset utilization metrics measure a company's operating efficiency. I'm going to measure the operating efficiency of Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Seagate (STX) and SanDisk. All four of the firms are roughly the same size, and they compete in the data storage industry. I'll examine the company's operating efficiency separately and compare the company's operating efficiency.SanDisk is becoming less efficient by almost every metric, but its inventory management has improved. Western Digital is also becoming more inefficient. Seagate was heading toward becoming more inefficient but was able to increase efficiency in 2012. Micron was able to increase efficiency, overall, but the company has become less efficient recently.Overall, Seagate is the most efficient company followed by Western Digital Corporation. Micron is third and SanDisk is the least efficient company. In terms of customer credit, SanDisk has the highest receivables turnover, which could mean that SanDisk has the most strict credit policy. I believe that Seagate and Western Digital have less strict credit policies, based on knowledge of the customers of the companies.Seagate may not be carrying enough inventory and could benefit from loosening the credit terms offered to customers. Micron and SanDisk probably have slower moving inventory. Western Digital is efficiently managing its inventory. Western and Seagate are more efficient in terms of assets.Overall, Western Digital is the best performing in terms of asset utilization, but Micron and Seagate are the companies showing improvement. SanDisk, the focus company, could improve its asset utilization as it continues to expand rapidly. I would be bullish on SanDisk, Micron and Western Digital based on this analysis.Financial Performance AnalysisIn this section, I'm going to analyze the historic financial performance of Micron, Seagate, Western Digital and SanDisk. I'll examine the relative profitabilities, growth rates and productive capacity relative to revenue. At the end, I will reach a conclusion based on the data.In terms of size, Western Digital and Seagate are the largest by revenue, and SanDisk is the smallest by revenue. But, SanDisk is the most profitable and Micron is the least profitable. The companies sell different products, but for investment purposes, I would favor SanDisk's profitability. Micron's ability to generate operating profit is inconsistent. Western Digital and Seagate are also investment candidates based on profitability.I'm going to use the 10-year revenue and EPS growth rates to compare the companies. SanDisk and Western Digital are the fastest growing companies. Seagate is growing in the high-single, low-teens range. It is worth noting that SanDisk's growth rate is slowing, but the growth rate remains bullish for the valuations.SanDisk has the least productive capacity, and Micron has the most productive capacity. Relative to revenue, SanDisk and Seagate are generating a substantial amount of revenue relative to productive capacity. Micron needs to do a much better job of generating revenue from its resources. SanDisk has done an excellent job of generating revenue without over investing in production equipment.The historic profitability, growth rate and productive capacity to revenue generation are bullish for the valuations of SanDisk.ValuationsI'm going to use a few models to value the common equity shares of SanDisk. One model estimates what the market is paying for the growth of the firm, and the second model is the multiplier model. SanDisk is growing in the 20+% range.Now, we'll discuss how the market is pricing the growth opportunities of the firms. The market is pricing the most growth into the share price of SanDisk. Western Digital and Seagate have roughly equal amounts of growth priced into their share prices, but Western Digital does have slightly more growth priced into its share price. Investors are demanding more compensation for holding shares of Seagate. Said differently, equity is expensive for Seagate. The cost of equity capital is roughly the same for SanDisk and Western Digital. Overall, I would say that those are fair assessments, but I would require a slightly higher required return for holding shares of SanDisk relative to Western because of the size difference. The SanDisk justified PE using this metric is 16.96. SanDisk has a forward PE of 11.7.The market is paying the highest premium for the sales and earnings of SanDisk, because SanDisk has the highest growth rate. Seagate has the lowest growth rate and deserves the lowest multiples. Western should be trading at a higher sales and price multiple. Given the growth forecast, shares of SanDisk are pretty reasonably priced in the market.The valuations don't suggest that shares of SanDisk are overvalued.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1653882,25245,2013-08-23T11:27:50-04:00,,"Is the PC dead or is there one more battle left in it? Is the mobile growing, slowing or flat? A number of such past trends with long runways have now become controversial. One that is not controversial is the transition from traditional storage to Flash memory. The old storage model was 'I want data to live forever'. That's been replaced with ""I want data to live long enough to run an analytics business over it"". Long enough (e.g. for Twitter or other social networking data) is not forever. And if forever data takes a long time to retrieve and analyze, then 'faster and somewhat flawed' storage is vastly better than perfect and slow (especially with redundant storage'). Ergo, the flash memory opportunity.So how does one play the flash disrupts storage phenomenon? If you're a gambler - you can play it thru hot young startups such as Fusion-IO (NYSE:FIO) or wait for the next big thing startup (e.g. Violin Memory) to go IPO. Those are options if you want to bet big and are willing to lose everything. What if you want to ride the trend, but with a margin of safety. In that case, you have a choice amongst memory players who have skin in the flash storage game - Sandisk (SNDK), Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).To me the preferred choice is someone with a large enough market cap, enough ""skin in the game"", and a history of winning. Here's a few reasons why that pick is Sandisk :Skin in the Game. Solid-state disks (flash storage) isn't just another market to Sandisk. It is the growth market, one they expect to be 40% of their business by 2016. And as the figure right after that shows, it's already in explosive growth mode.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Reasonable Valuation. Enterprise value to EBITDA is one of several metrics for valuation. On that dimension, Sandisk does quite well. Samsung is a formidable competitor and the first to 3-D NAND memory, but again is a conglomerate with fingers in many pies. Intel is cheap, but a company with numerous issues and diluted focus and about the same EV/EBITDA as Sandisk. That leaves us with Micron vs. Sandisk, and if you look a long-term chart, you see that there is no period in which you were at an advantage to pick Micron over Sandisk.(Click to enlarge)Few warts and hidden skeletons. Samsung is a great flash memory competitor, but its mobile business is a big unknown. They're great, but have they peaked there? Intel is a higher dividend (one they didn't raise by the way), but their largest market is dying, and their mobile forays are bigger news when they're announced than when they are executed. Sandisk has no such problems. They are in businesses that are deeply cyclical, but have innovated their way out of cycles better than their competitors.Downside Support. Downside support for a tech stock during summer is a relative term, and particularly so in an inflated market. Sandisk is trading at a P/E of 11, and with a newly instated dividend of 1.6%. The dividend is less than 20% of earnings, and therefore has room to grow quickly.I estimate that the combination of reasonable P/E, a Zacks strong buy rating, and a moderate dividend give it a downside in the low 50's and an upside in the mid 70s. Importantly, with tech stocks - a trend is your friend, and Sandisk is riding a trend that has legs to it. As always, take this as considered input and do your own due diligence as well.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1837382,46721,2013-11-13T15:39:51-05:00,,"In my last post, I outlined at a high level an investment case for Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC). I continue to believe that it remains undervalued despite a 69% rally in its share price over the last 12 months, as both the business itself and the industry in which it operates is misunderstood by investors generally. I believe a conservative estimate of the intrinsic value of the business is between $21 billion - $25 billion, compared to its present market capitalisation of approx. $16.9 billion, representing upside of between 23% - 52%. In this post, I set out a detailed fundamental business and valuation analysis for WDC, which I believe justifies my estimate of intrinsic value.1. Executive SummaryWestern Digital Corporation (""WDC"" or the ""Company"") is currently priced at approx. $71 per share in the market, giving a total equity value for the business of approx. $16.9 billion.I conservatively estimate intrinsic value for the entire Company to be in the range of $21 billion - $25 billion, or $86 - $106 per share, based on a detailed fundamental analysis of the business, its industry, management and future prospects.My investment approach for equities is to acquire fractional ownership in businesses at a price that affords me a satisfactory margin of safety to mitigate against error, imprecision, bad luck or the vicissitudes of the stock market. I therefore look to pay prices that approximate no more than two-thirds of a conservative estimate of intrinsic value for an entire business or company.On this basis, my analysis leads me to conclude that WDC is a Buy at $63 or less per share, being a 33% discount to the mid-point of my estimated range for intrinsic value, of $23 billion. I believe that buying into the business at this price level should afford me a satisfactory margin of safety.2. Investment Thesis & CatalystsDespite the significant rise in its share price over the last 12 months, WDC remains undervalued in the market versus a conservative estimate of its intrinsic value. This undervaluation is attributable to a misunderstanding of both the Company and the data storage industry by investors. Essentially, WDC has suffered from a double-fear of obsolescence:· Firstly, it suffers from the perception that it is primarily a PC-related business, having historically been a major manufacturer of hard disk drives (HDDs) for the PC market, and so is part of the ""Death of the PC"" narrative that has gained traction with the rise of smartphones, tablets and cloud computing· Secondly, HDDs themselves have come to be viewed as a storage medium destined for obsolescence with the increased adoption of Solid State Drives (SSDs) that use NAND flash memory and which offer improved performance over HDDsThis perception of both WDC and data storage technology is in fact overly simplistic, flawed, and constitutes a clear misunderstanding of both the Company and the data storage market itself, for the following reasons:· Non-PC related business now accounts for approx. 50% of WDC's revenues, and following the intelligent strategic acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST), it has significant exposure to the higher margin enterprise storage segment of the market· Secondly, WDC has and continues to develop a growing SSD presence, with 5 SSD-related acquisitions (SiliconSystems, HGST, STEC, VeloBit and Virident) since 2009, as well as having a strategic investment in a pure-play, high-growth SSD business, Skyera.· These acquisitions are evidence that management is transitioning the business from being a traditional HDD manufacturer to a HDD/SSD solutions business, recognizing that both storage mediums have a role in the continued growth of digital content and consequent storage requirements· Therefore WDC is not simply a HDD business, and indicates intelligent capital allocation by management to enhance its data storage offering, gain exposure to the high-growth SSD/tablet computing market and thereby combat any potential obsolescence risk facing traditional HDD storage.· Additionally, the threat of obsolescence facing HDD is overstated, as not all data needs to be stored in SSD form and not every device requires the rapid access times that SSDs permit. While ultrabooks, smartphones and tablets now use SSD storage, the majority of data continues to be stored on HDD (70% of all exabytes in 2013 according to WDC), rather than SSD, flash memory and other storage mediums. This is likely to remain the case, due to two factors - continued data growth and the cost-benefit of HDD versus other mediums. At present, SSDs remain 8x - 10x more expensive than HDDs, and the continued rapid growth in digital content means that HDD remains the most economic and appropriate medium to meet storage requirements arising from continuous data growth· Digital content continues to growth at an exponential rate, and is perhaps one of the great secular growth stories of our time - digital content growth and the corresponding growth in storage requirements are forecast to have a CAGR of between 30% - 50% over the next 5 - 7 years according to various industry and market reports. The data storage business is therefore one with favourable long-term prospects, which bodes well for WDC· The above facts appear to have been lost within the clamor for all things smart/tablet-computing related in recent times however, leading to a flawed assessment of WDC and hence its undervaluation in the market· WDC is a fundamentally strong business with excellent management and an excellent performance track record - over the last 10 years it has achieved consistent growth in revenues and free cash flow using minimal debt, and generated consistently high returns on capital in an intensively competitive and commoditized industry, to the point where it now has the leading market share in the HDD segment· All of this creates an attractive investment opportunity; the catalyst for the full value of WDC's business to be realised is the market's eventual recognition of two key factors: (1) at the broader industry level, digital content will continue to grow at an exponential rate, which will require storage, which will be met by HDD, SSD and other storage mediums that will complement each other and the nature of data to be stored, and (2) WDC has proven itself to be the best in class operator, with an excellent business that now offers multiple storage solutions catering to all major areas of storage demand3. Company Overview & HistoryWDC is a developer and manufacturer of data storage devices, networking equipment and home entertainment products serving all primary data storage markets- enterprise and cloud data centers, client (PC) market, consumer electronics, data backup, internet and other emerging markets such as automotive and home and small office networking.Historically, WDC's principal products have been hard disk drives, but in recent years, WDC has expanded into other storage products including solid-state drives, home entertainment and networking products and software applications for smartphones and tablets.WDC was originally founded in 1970 as a specialized semiconductor manufacturer, and entered the storage industry in 1988. In that time it has grown by both innovation and acquisition to become the leading HDD manufacturer in terms of market share and sales today. In 2012, WDC acquired HGST, allowing it to surpass competitor Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) as the leading HDD manufacturer, and crucially expanding its enterprise storage offering. HGST develops advanced hard drives for enterprise, cloud, personal computing, consumer electronics, enterprise-class solid state drives and external storage solutions. WDC is headquartered in Irvine, California, with additional offices and facilities in the US, Europe, Asia and Brazil.In 2013, WDC made two further significant acquisitions, with the purchases of sTec, Inc., an established provider of enterprise storage class and solid-state drives in June, and of Virident Systems Inc. in September. Virident is a provider of ""flash"" storage solutions for the enterprise storage market segment. Both acquisitions are intended to boost WDC's presence in enterprise and SSD, key growth segments within the data storage market.For the most recent financial year to 30 June 2013, WDC reported sales of $15.4 billion, net income of $1.7 billion and free cash flow of $2.2 billion. WDC is a constituent company of the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ 100, and is listed on the NASDAQ.Its share price has increased approx. 69% in the last 12 months (S&P 500: 24%), and 526% over the last 5 years (S&P: 96%).The company has grown revenues, net income and free cash flow at CAGRs of 19.7%, 22.3% and 32.6% over the last 10 years respectively, while delivering average returns on invested capital in excess of 40% over the same period. Over the same time horizon, the Company's market cap has increased at a CAGR of approximately 27.5%, or 8.9x, from $1.9 billion to $16.9 billion.4. Data Storage Industry OverviewIn broad terms, the data storage industry comprises three main categories of businesses: (1) information infrastructure businesses, (2) hard disk drive (HDD) manufacturers and (3) solid-state drive (SSD) and flash technology memory manufacturers. Major players in each category at present include:The information infrastructure companies provide data storage solutions primarily to large-scale, enterprise class customers including businesses, government agencies and data centers. Information infrastructure companies provide both hardware and software products, including storage array systems, back-up, recovery and archiving solutions, security and encryption applications, data management systems, big data applications, cloud storage services and platforms and consulting services. Products such as storage arrays use both HDD and SSD drives as components.HDD companies have traditionally produced hard drives for consumers and businesses, supplying PC Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) such as Dell (NYSE:DELL) and Hewlett-Packard with internal disk drives for desktop and notebook computers, external hard drives for consumers and storage solutions for businesses and enterprise-class customers.SSD manufacturers develop and supply hard drives using SSD/flash storage technology. SSDs use flash technology and have numerous performance advantages over HDDs, including faster data recovery, greater energy efficiency, no noise, are light-weight and use less moving parts. SSDs have replaced HDDs in certain applications, such as in mission-critical enterprise applications and smart/mobile computer devices, including smartphones, tablets and ultrabooks.However over the last 5 years, the HDD industry has consolidated significantly, and with the two remaining independent HDD manufacturers WDC and STX transitioning into SSD manufacturers as well.Data Storage Technology - HDDs vs. SSDsHDD companies such as WDC have traditionally manufactured hard disk drives (HDDs) that use rotating magnetic disks to store and allow fast access to data. A HDD consists of one or more rigid, rapidly rotating discs or platters with magnetic heads. The storage capacity of a hard drive is determined by the number of disks and each disk's areal density (that is, the amount of data that can be stored on a given area of surface on a storage medium). Since their introduction by IBM in 1956, HDDs have been the dominant secondary storage medium in computing (as opposed to primary storage, being the CPU), and have maintained this position into the present with continued technological improvements. Despite the introduction of solid state drives using newer flash memory technology, HDDs remain the primary storage medium for digital content today, with the total addressable market (TAM) for HDDs in 2012 estimated to be approx. 592 million units shipped, compared with approx. 39 million SSD units shipped, according to IHS, the analytics firm. SSD shipments are now forecast to increase to 83 million units in 2013, and to 239 million units by 2016.In recent years, SSDs have become primary competing technology to HDDs. SSDs use non-volatile, semiconductor technology known as NAND flash memory, rather than magnetic discs, to store and allow fast access to data without any moving parts. With SSDs, data is stored on NAND memory chips, which do not require power to retain data. Compared to HDDs, SSDs offer greater performance, being faster in terms of access time, are less susceptible to physical shock, produce no noise, and are more energy efficient. While SSDs offer greater performance, HDDs offer greater capacity at present, due to the higher cost and limited supply of NAND.A recent innovation is the hybrid drive, which is seen as a cost-efficient compromise between HDD and SSD. Hybrid drives combine the higher performance of NAND flash memory as used in SSDs with the greater storage capacity of a magnetic HDD. This combination allows better pricing and so provides a more cost-effective solution than a pure SSD, while providing sufficient capacity to meet storage needs.At present, HDDs remain the dominant medium however, primarily due to lower cost, wider availability and higher capacity compared with SSD/flash-based storage devices. At present, SSDs are approximately 8x - 10x the cost of HDDs on a per-gigabyte of storage basis. The higher cost is attributable to both the higher cost of development and production of flash chips versus magnetic discs, and to frequent supply constraints for NAND flash memory. Flash memory is used exclusively in smartphones and tablet computer devices, meaning a significant and continuously growing demand for NAND chips as these devices have gained in popularity. Moreover, demand for NAND flash memory for SSD storage at the enterprise end of the market (i.e. servers and other data centre equipment) has also increased dramatically, leading to a limited supply of NAND. Within the SSD segment, major competitors to WDC such as Micron, Samsung, Toshiba and SanDisk manufacture their own NAND chips for their SSDs, giving them an advantage over WDC (and STX) which currently has to purchase NAND from third parties. However, WDC and SanDisk announced in May 2013 that both companies were collaborating to manufacture hybrid drives, which will benefit WDC by giving it access to a steady NAND supply via this partnership with SanDisk.In time, the cost of SSD storage is predicted to decline and converge with that of HDDs, due to expected technological improvements and increased. It has been predicted that SSDs will eventually replace HDDs to the point of near or even total obsolescence (similar to CDs replacing cassettes tapes for example), once cost declines sufficiently. Therefore the advent of mobile computing (including smartphone and tablets), SSD technology is perceived as the data storage medium of the future, as such devices use SSDs due to their greater speed and lighter, more compact and non-volatile form factor.However, it is important to consider that given the continued growth in digital content in areas such as Big Data and cloud and mobile computing in the context of supply constraints and higher relative cost for SSD production, it is likely that HDDs will continue to be the dominant data storage medium for the foreseeable future. Another consideration that is often overlooked in the excitement generated in relation to all things smartphone and tablet-related, is the fact that not all data actually requires SSD storage, as not every device requires rapid access to data. For example, while a tablet computer will use an SSD drive, the data, which is consumed on it, will be stored in the cloud, i.e. on an enterprise server in a data centre, which will most likely use HDDs for their capacity and lower cost. Therefore it is far from certain that SSDs will fully replace HDDs. At present, the price of SSDs is declining, but not at a rate sufficient enough to totally replace HDD from an economic perspective, particularly given the on-going rate of data content creation.Data Storage Demand TrendsThe shift to mobile computing and the emergence of Big Data are the two major demand trends impacting the data storage industry and are secular in nature. With mobile computing, more and more data is being consumed via mobile devices, as evidenced by the declines in PC shipments (10.9% YoY in Q2 2013 according to Gartner). All data consumed and produced via mobile devices is invariably accessed and stored via cloud computing, which means that data is ultimately stored on enterprise-class HDDs or SSDs in a data centre.Similarly, given its scale and complexity, Big Data has enormous enterprise-class storage requirements. Big Data covers huge volumes of complex structured and unstructured data across the entire data spectrum including videos uploaded to YouTube, digital movies on HD-TVs, banking data processed at ATMs, security footage at airports, subatomic collisions recorded by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, voice-calls made over digital phone lines, medical records and numerous other kinds of other digital content.Both of these trends have created a huge and ever-growing demand for enterprise-class storage solutions, which will continue to be the biggest driver of demand for data storage devices. As such, data storage, and the enterprise-class segment in particular is a secular, high-growth story for the foreseeable future.Consolidation and TransitionThe hard drive manufacturing end of the storage industry (i.e. HDD and SSD) is intensely competitive with HDD and SSD suppliers competing for sales to a small number of major customers. As a product hard drives are highly substitutable, and therefore there are limited barriers to prevent existing competitors from offering similar products. As per WDC's 2012 annual report:The commoditized nature of the industry has led to significant consolidation within the industry to a point where only three strong manufacturers now remain.While the SSD industry segment remains somewhat fragmented with a number of private and mid-cap manufacturers competing with the three dominant players in Samsung (31% market share), SanDisk (17%) and Toshiba (9%), the HDD industry is effectively now a duopoly between WDC and Seagate. Since 2007, the HDD industry has consolidated from 8 major manufacturers to just three major manufacturers today. The most significant phase of this consolidation wave occurred in 2012 when WDC acquired HGST (which in turn was formerly part of IBM), while Seagate acquired Samsung's HDD business, reducing the industry to the current duopoly between WDC (44.5% market share) and Seagate (41.5%), with Toshiba trailing in third place (~13%). WDC's acquisition of HGST was notable in that it gave WDC, traditionally a PC OEM supplier, greater exposure to the high margin enterprise storage market segment, and thereby to cloud and large-scale enterprise storage customers, the highest growth segment within the industry. Prior to this, Seagate had a stronger enterprise-class presence.The consolidation within the HDD industry has also meant that margins have improved. The HDD industry, along with many supply chain companies to the computing and data storage industries were impacted by severe flooding in Thailand in October 2011, where many industry manufacturing facilities are located. The floods resulted in temporary suspension of operations and a drop in margins to sub-20%. Prior to these floods, HDD gross margins averaged 20% over the period from 2003 to 2010. The post-flood recovery in the industry combined with the consolidation to an effective duopoly has meant that gross margins have increased and been maintained by both WDC and Seagate to a 28% - 30% range in 2012 and 2013, with both companies targeting a 27% - 32% gross margin range going forward.By contrast, SSD margins have tended to be significantly higher than HDD historically, with pure-play SSD companies such as sTec, SanDisk, Fusion-io and OCZ achieving gross margins in the 30% - 50% range over the last 5 years. Additionally, enterprise storage drive gross margins tend to be approx. double those for desktop and laptop PCs.Given the increased adoption of SSD technology in recent times, the big three HDD manufacturers have moved to transition from traditional HDD businesses into both HDD and SSD manufacturers, developing SSD solutions internally through R&D, development of hybrid drives combining both technologies, and by strategically acquiring SSD businesses to augment their data storage offering.5. Data Storage Business ProspectsDespite historically being a commoditized industry, the trend of consolidation has resulted in the survival of only the strongest companies in this industry. Coupling this with the ongoing secular growth in data creation, analysis and consumption, the data storage business is one with very favourable business prospects.At a high level, particular ""megatrends"" expected to drive increasing storage requirements for the foreseeable future include the storing of human genome data for the world's approx. 7 billion people, all social media content, personal consumer data and Big Data. More specifically, the following factors are expected to be key growth drivers for the industry in the future:· Rapid growth in creation, sharing and distribution of digital content via social networking platforms, email, high resolution images, high definition video content, movie/tv/music streaming services, electronic data from businesses, and large data files· Continued advances in online/network infrastructure and accessibility, including wireless/broadband access, cloud computing, local networking, smart/internet television, increased bandwidth, facilitating improved data access, hosting and distribution· Rapid growth in consumption of digital content due to mobile and tablet computing devices, smartphones, DVRs, gaming consoles, set-top boxes and media equipment, motor vehicles· Continued need for data protection and digital content back-up· Advances and tailoring in storage technology due to technological improvements in terms of capacity, performance, power requirements/efficiency· Adoption of different storage architectures and solutions to meet specific storage requirementsEach of the above factors will drive continually increasing demand for data storage devices as the ever-growing body of digital content globally will require increased capacity to store, manage, access, back-up and distribute this content.Unabated data growth outlookThe standard metric for measuring data storage in the industry is the exabyte, which is 1 billion gigabytes. To put this in context, according to an IDC paper sponsored by EMC, 161 exabytes of data were created in 2006, which approximated ""3 million times the amount of information contained in all the books ever written."" IDC published a study in December 2012, The Digital Universe in 2020: Big Data, Bigger Data Shadows, and the Biggest Growth in the Far East, which reported that from 2005 to 2020, the digital universe will grow by a factor of 300, from 130 exabytes to 40,000 exabytes, or 40 trillion gigabytes (more than 5,200 gigabytes for every man, woman, and child in 2020). From now until 2020, the digital universe will about double every two years. Furthermore, IDC found that the proliferation of devices such as PCs and smartphones worldwide, increased Internet access within emerging markets and the boost in data from machines such as surveillance cameras or smart meters has contributed to the doubling of the digital universe within the past two years alone. In April 2013, IDC produced a further report, stating that Big Data is fuelling enterprise demand for increased data storage, a market that IDC forecasts to increase at a 53 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through to 2016.These findings also square with WDC and Seagate's own business outlooks - WDC stated in their conference call for the March 2013 quarter that ""We believe digital data growth will continue unabated for the foreseeable future with total exabyte shift growing from 600 exabytes in 2012 to at least 5,900 exabytes by 2020, representing a 33% compounded annual growth rate."" Similarly, Seagate management stated on their March 2013 conference call that ""the growth trajectory of data-driven in part by cloud of mobile applications has our industry on pace to close to 500 exabytes of storage and is advancing at a rate which is more than two times greater than expected areal density growth rate,"" meaning in simple terms that the data is growing at more than two times the expected HDD capacity growth rate. Finally, Toshiba, the third major HDD player indicated in January 2013 that the volume of data generated globally has been increasing by over 40% annually, while Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) estimated that worldwide cloud traffic will grow at an annual rate of 45%. By 2017, 48% of the global population will be online, up from 32% at present according to Cisco's Visual Networking Index forecast from May 2013, meaning that the number of devices and connections can only grow. All of this suggests that evermore creation and consumption of digital content.At this point then, based on the views of both the manufacturers themselves and independent industry research, it is reasonable to conclude that data storage is a growth industry with positive business prospects. Perhaps it could be argued on the basis of the above that only three things are certain in life now - death, taxes and continued data growth; data growth is a simple function of time and technology - digital content will only ever grow, and not diminish with the passage of time, as more and more people use devices to create and consume countless types of digital content that will require storage, while data itself is never ""uncreated"". Data storage must therefore be considered a secular growth story.HDD and SSD segment growthWithin the general data storage industry outlook, what of the growth prospects for the competing technologies of HDDs and SSDs themselves?With regard to HDDs, WDC's Investor Presentation for June 2013 projects that over 75% of exabytes in 2020 (or 4,425 exabytes) will be stored on HDDs. This expectation is based on the relative supply, capacity and cost advantages relative to SSDs, enabling HDD to dominate as the most cost effective mass storage medium, primarily in the enterprise storage segment. Referring again to WDC's March 2013 quarter conference call, CEO Stephen Milligan stated that management expected a longer-term unit growth for HDDs of 3%. How does this compare to independent industry forecasts though? In Q1 of 2013, Gartner forecast HDD unit CAGR of 2.4% to 2017, while a May 2013 report from IHS forecasts a HDD CAGR of -2.9% to 2017. However, other industry reports outline a more robust outlook. TechNavio's report, Global Hard Disk Drive Market 2011-2015 forecasts that the global HDD market will grow at a CAGR of 8.1% to 2015, primarily driven by demand from the enterprise segment. In addition, IDC published a report in April 2012, Worldwide Hard Disk Drive 2012-2016 Forecast: The Industry Hits the Reset Button, forecasting a HDD unit CAGR of 9.6% to 2016. On balance then WDC management forecasts would appear conservative.While the outlook for HDDs is decidedly modest, the outlook for SSDs by contrast is universally bullish. IHS forecast SSD unit shipments to grow at a CAGR of 63% to 2016, with PCs alone to grow at a CAGR of 48% to 2017. Similarly, IDC in January 2012 forecast SSD to grow at a CAGR of 51.5% to 2015, attributable to lower prices per gigabyte, increased use of hybrid drives and increased enterprise adoption of SSD storage to complement HDD solutions. In terms of market share, SSDs are forecast to increase market share from 6% to 36% in the PC storage market alone by 2017 according to IHS, with HDD market share for PC storage declining to 64% from 94%. More recently, a study by IDC indicates that revenues from SSDs are expected to reach $7 billion in 2017 from the approximately $2.5 billion estimated for 2012, implying a CAGR of 23%.Overall then, despite the bleak outlook for PCs, digital content growth is expected to drive continued data storage demand, primarily in the enterprise storage segment. On balance the outlook for HDDs is low to modest growth, with very strong growth forecast for SSDs. As the dominant HDD manufacturer in the PC segment, with a growing enterprise storage presence and a nascent SSD business line, WDC would appear to have favourable prospects itself, operating in this high-growth industry.6. Business ModelWDC operates a global business through two independent subsidiaries due to regulatory requirements-Western Digital (WD) and HGST. Within these subsidiaries, WDC has three brands - WD , HGST and G-Technology (both HGST)WDC has four distinct business segments, as follows:1. Enterprise2. Client Compute3. Consumer Electronics4. Branded Products1. Enterprise - Enterprise storage devices require the greatest capabilities and reliability, and consist of high performance and capacity hard drives and solid-state drives. These are used in multiple types of enterprise data-centers, and provide storage solutions for a range of cloud and corporate applications. Within data-centers, these drives are typically used in workstations, computer servers and storage systems. This class of drives is the most highly engineered product line in the storage industry.The Enterprise segment also consists of solid-state drives for use in embedded applications, such as network communications and industrial, medical, military and aerospace applications, all of which require high durability and long life cycles.2. Client Compute (Desktop & Notebook PCs) - Client storage devices consist of internal hard drives and solid-state drives for desktop and mobile (Notebook) PCs.3. Consumer Electronics (CE) - CE devices include hard drives used in digital video recorders (DVRs), game consoles and security video recording systems.4. Branded Products - include external storage devices for PCs and home and small office networks, USB drives, and media players for television/home theatre systems.Revenue % by business segment for last 5 years by number of hard drive units shipped is as follows:Historically, the majority of revenues have been generated by the Client Compute (PC) segment, with CE and Branded Products segments remaining relatively stable.Per the company's recently filed 10-K for the financial year to June 2013, 50% of revenue was derived from non-Compute (PC) markets, including enterprise drives, solid-state drives, CE products and branded products, up from 36% in FY12. This is significant and indicates that with half of all revenues now generated from the non-PC segments, WDC is becoming less a PC-oriented business, and transitioning to an enterprise, cloud and SSD-oriented data storage business. As such, WDC has significant exposure to, and is participating in the higher-growth data-storage markets of the future. This is something that to date has not been fully understood by investors. This transition is something that has been actively managed by management over the last 8 years as the overall revenue mix has shifted significantly away from traditional PC HDDs to non-PC related segments:The Enterprise segment has been the fastest growing segment for WDC, with units shipped growing at a CAGR of 45% over the period shown. WDC's acquisition of HGST allowed them to gain a stronger foothold in the enterprise market, with IDC ranking HGST as one of the Top 5 external data storage providers in the world in 2011 behind, EMC, IBM, HP and NetApp. Furthermore, the recently announced acquisition of sTec in June 2013 increases WDC's exposure to the high growth enterprise and SSD storage market segments. sTec is an enterprise-class SSD storage business, whose customers include IBM and EMC. WDC's acquisition (for $340 million in cash) of STEC therefore further leverages WDC to the high growth end of the data storage market. Similarly, the post-2013 year-end acquisition of Virident in September 2013 enhances WDC's enterprise-SSD offering, with Virident being a leading flash storage provider to the enterprise segment. Virident's customers include EMC, LinkedIn and Micron. Prior to the acquisition, Virident stated that it expected 2013 revenues to increase 140% from 2012 levels, and expects to triple its customer base by 2014. Finally, WDC announced a strategic collaboration with competitor SanDisk to manufacture hybrid drives in May 2013. This is a significant development, and indicates that hybrid drives represent a significant revenue opportunity for WDC, given that SanDisk, a leading SSD/flash storage manufacturer, has sought to enter the nascent hybrid space.[Note the analysis above and below excludes any results for recent acquisitions sTec and Virident].CustomersWDC's customers include PC and Mac providers, storage subsystem suppliers, and Internet and social media infrastructure players. WDC sell products to OEMs, distributors, resellers and consumers. The chart below breaks down revenue by customer type over the period:OEMs have traditionally been the largest customer segment. These include companies such as Dell, HP and Lenovo (OTCPK:LNVGF). The Distributor segment includes technology wholesalers including Avnet (NASDAQ:AVT), Ingram Micro (NYSE:IM) and numerous others. Retailers include major retailers and include computer superstores, online retailers and electronic stores. Retail sales are also made via the WDC website.Historically, Dell and HP have been the largest customers of WDC, however no individual customer has generally accounted for more than 10%-11% of revenues. During the last three financial years (FY11 - FY13) sales to WDC's top 10 customers accounted for approx. 48% on average. [Note the above analysis excludes any results for recent acquisitions sTec and Virident].Geographic spread:In terms of geographical spread, the majority of WDC's customers have been in Asia, followed by a generally even distribution between the Americas and EMEA regions historically, as shown below:The concentration of customers in Asia is attributable to the fact that both WDC's manufacturing facilities and those of its larger customers (e.g. OEMs such as Dell) are located in Asia. For this reason, a large proportion of revenues are generated in this region.Manufacturing operations are based in California and in Asia, in particular China, Malaysia and Thailand.MarginsGross margins for HDDs are currently in the 28-32% range, but historically have averaged approx. 20% prior to 2011. In late 2011, severe flooding in Thailand resulted in the temporary closing of approx. 45% of the HDD industry's assembly capacity and a significant part of the associated supply chain. This caused component shortages, leading to a significant undersupply for HDDs. This resulted in higher HDD prices in the first half of 2012, boosting margins for WDC and Seagate to approx. 30%. In addition, WDC's acquisition of HGST and major competitor Seagate's acquisition of Samsung's HDD business consolidated the HDD market from 5 companies to 3 (Toshiba being the only other HDD manufacturer) in 2012. The resultant duopoly between WDC and Seagate has allowed both companies to maintain gross margins at post-flood levels to date (28% - 30%), with both companies targeting a 27% - 32% gross margin range going forward.SSD margins for the pure-play SSD companies such as STEC, SanDisk, Fusion-io and OCZ have historically been in the 30% - 50% range over the last 5 years, while enterprise storage drive gross margins tend to be double or more those of desktop and laptop PCs (approx. 40% based on pre-flood PC HDD margins).7. Financial OverviewSummary financial performance for WDC for the preceding 10-year period is as follows:8. Competitive AdvantageWDC's business exhibits a number of characteristics that indicate it has built up a competitive advantage within its industry:Lowest cost operator in commoditised industryIn a commoditized industry, the strongest company is usually the lowest cost producer. Looking at the HDD industry over the last 10 years, WDC has managed to maintain a lower cost basis as measured by operating expenses as a % of revenue (excluding R&D, impairment charges, restructuring costs and other exceptional items), as shown below:Comparing WDC to its most directly comparable competitor Seagate, WDC has maintained an average 1.2% better OpEx cost differential over the 10-year period. Including R&D within this measure, the relative performance is even stronger in WDC's favour, with WDC averaging 10.4% over the 10-year period, compared with Seagate's 13.9%.In terms of gross margin, having historically lagged Seagate by approx. 4% on average, WDC overtook STX in FY13, the year in which it gained the largest market share, indicating a change in competitive dynamics within the industry and helped by the HGST acquisition improving the revenue mix with increased exposure to the higher margin enterprise drive segment. (FY13 is the first year to include a full year of HGST results within WDC reported results):Over the last 10 years, WDC's gross margin has trended consistently upwards as it became the dominant player in the HDD industry, to the point where it is now the stronger half of the duopoly with STX and should benefit from pricing power to sustain its target margins of 28-32%. Furthermore, its transition to a higher margin enterprise and SSD business should also help support its margins, where pure play SSD businesses have historically achieved margins in the 30% - 50% range.Dominant HDD manufacturerWDC has consistently grown its market share to the point where it has become the dominant player in a consolidated industry with the largest market share:As of July 2013, WDC has approx. a 45% market share, gaining 10.9% at the expense of Seagate and Toshiba YoY. This gain in market share is primarily attributable to the HGST acquisition, with FY13 including full year results for HGST for the first time after the acquisition closed in 2012. Given that it is the lowest cost producer with the largest market share in a fully consolidated industry it is unlikely that a competitor would be able to step in and undermine WDC going forward, providing a barrier to entry to the industry that should protect WDC's position.Cash Generating AbilityWDC has consistently been the most cash generative hard drive manufacturer historically, as measured by both cash conversion cycle (CCC) and free-cash flow (FCF) margin:In terms of CCC, WDC has historically converted sales to cash at a faster rate than STX, with a modestly negative cycle on average, compared with STX, which has had a modestly positive cycle. Both companies' CCCs increased over the prior year, attributable to more timely repayments to creditors on average. However, the longer-term track record indicates that WDC has demonstrated superior management of its CCC.In terms of assessing free-cash flow margin (being free cash flow/revenue %), WDC again has the superior record:The consistent upward trend in FCF margin also indicates that WDC has built a competitive advantage in being able to generate true, cash earnings. While in FY13 STX has a slightly higher margin, WDC has delivered a less volatile, steadily rising FCF margin over a 10-year time frame, with an average FCF margin of 9%, compared with STX's 8%. Generally, any business that can achieve a 5% margin with consistency is a cash cow-type business, and while both WDC and STX qualify in this regard, WDC's record is that it's a bit superior in generating true cash earnings. Since the last major round of consolidation within the HDD industry occurred in 2011, on average 14% of every dollar in sales made by WDC has translated into FCF, compared with 12.4% for STX over the same period.LeverageHistorically, WDC has maintained the strongest balance sheet in the industry, as measured by debt-to-total-capital:In each of the last 10 years, WDC has maintained a net cash position, with a modest amount of debt, while STX has been moderately to significantly leveraged, with a net debt position in 6 of the last 7 years, again indicating WDC possesses a competitive advantage within the industry. WDC has been able to grow and generate cash earnings without the use of significant leverage.Return on CapitalWarren Buffett has espoused that companies generating consistent returns on equity (with little-to-no debt) of greater than 15% typically have a sustainable competitive advantage. Given the differing capital structures between WDC and STX, it is more meaningful to compare return on capital between WDC and STX, rather than simple ROE to assess any sustainable competitive advantage.I consider return on capital from two perspectives, and my preferred measures are Buffett's Return on Unleveraged Net Tangible Assets (ROUNTA), which excludes goodwill and Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), inclusive of goodwill. As Buffett stated:On this basis, ROUNTA is perhaps the best indicator of a company's true return on capital invested in operations, as it reflects both debt and equity capital, and excludes goodwill and other intangible assets, which may reflect arbitrary historic decisions (such as acquisition premiums paid) that may not reflect the economic reality of a business. Additionally, I look at ROIC, which again includes debt and equity capital, but I include goodwill to assess management's capital allocation decisions in the past, as it reflects prices paid for acquired entities or assets, which is relevant in the context of the acquisitions by WDC in the context of a consolidated industry. My ROIC also excludes cash, unlike ROUNTA, on the basis, that WDC as a highly cash generative business with a very short CCC and historically a neutral to negative working capital cycle, has a significant amount of cash on hand and so one could argue is not ""invested"" in operational assets which generate its FCF. Finally, I must qualify here however that I use FCF as proxy for owner earnings, or true, cash earnings to the owner of a business for the ""return"" measure, rather than accounting earnings, which do not always reflect economic reality.Both measures indicate the persistence of a competitive advantage or economic moat in Buffett parlance, despite the commoditized nature of the industry in which WDC operates, as ROUNTA for most recent full financial year is 30% (vs. 10-year average of 25%) and ROIC is 33% (10-Year average is 44%)Both measures demonstrate that the Company has consistently delivered rates of return on capital significantly in excess of average market rates of return. Compared to STX however, WDC returns, while high, have lagged STX on average (using ROUNTA):STX's higher returns have been attributable to STX historically having greater exposure to the higher margin enterprise segment. However, WDC's return profile has been significantly less volatile and unpredictable compared with STX. Additionally, the acquisitions of HGST, sTec and Virident, all higher margin enterprise and SSD focused businesses, should help WDC maintain and improve its returns on capital going forward.Commoditized industry and investment propositionWhile WDC operates in a commoditized industry, I do not believe this disqualifies WDC from being a good investment. Commodity-type businesses are usually characterized by all or some of the following:· Low gross margins· Low returns on capital· Absence of brand loyalty· Presence of multiple competitors/operators· Excess production capacity versus demand· Erratic profitsI believe WDC counters each of the above characteristics as follows:On the basis of the above, WDC demonstrates that it is an attractive investment proposition with favourable prospects, despite the commoditized nature of its industry.Competitive Advantage - Overall Assessment using SWOT analysisOn balance, it appears that the strengths and opportunities for WDC's business outweigh the weaknesses and threats facing it.9. Management ability and integrity:In assessing management performance, I examine 4 areas:· Returns on capital· Capital allocation· Remuneration· Insider holdingsReturns on capital: as Buffett stated in his 1979 shareholders' letter, the primary test of managerial economic performance is the achievement of a high earnings rate on equity capital employed (without undue leverage, accounting gimmickry etc). The ROUNTA and ROIC analysis provided above clearly demonstrates that WDC's management have acted as effective stewards of the business for its owners, the shareholders. Consistently high returns on capital, in excess of average market rates of return, without any meaningful leverage, indicate that management have and continue to be highly capable managers of the business.Capital allocation: there are three primary areas in which an assessment of WDC management's allocation of capital should concern itself in my view: (1) M&A, (2) share repurchases and dividend policy, and (3) retention of earnings compared to increase in market value.Firstly, I believe management have intelligently allocated capital historically by the businesses they have acquired or invested in. As outlined above, the enterprise and cloud segments are the high growth segments within the data storage industry, while SSD-oriented technology is the higher growth technology trend going forward. WDC management have clearly understood these aspects of their business, and continue to transition the business in this regard away from the traditional PC-reliant HDD model, without a decline in profitability or employing excessive leverage. The most notable capital allocation decision from management over the previous 10 years has been the acquisition of HGST. HGST was acquired for $4.3 billion, or approx. 5x EBITDA, a relatively modest multiple, and resulted in WDC becoming the dominant HDD manufacturer with the greatest market share, surpassing STX, while also giving it significantly increased exposure to the high margin enterprise and SSD ends of the market. To finance the acquisition, WDC assumed $2.3 billion of debt, but still remained in a net cash position given its significant cash generation at the time. The rationale for assuming the additional debt was to lower its cost of capital as interest rates were declining at the time, and to avoid tax that would have arisen should it have used its own cash reserves - approx. 65% of the Company's cash is held overseas, and would have subject to tax were it to have been repatriated to the US parent company to fund the transaction. Further evidence of intelligent capital allocation has been WDC's acquisition of STEC for $340 million in cash in June 2013 (not included in 2013 financial results). STEC is primarily an enterprise-oriented SSD manufacturer, and has been a top 10 SSD manufacturer for the last 5-6 years, although it has suffered from poor management, particularly in relation to sales and marketing, both areas of strength for WDC. WDC has effectively paid a relatively low price of $340 million (versus its own FCF of $2 billion+) for STEC's strategically valuable enterprise-SSD technology and IP, again indicating an intelligent allocation of capital. So this again demonstrates management's intention to continue to transition the business towards the higher growth (and margin) data storage segments. WDC has also made a number of other smaller, strategically significant investments this year, including investing $51 million in Skyera, which develops energy-efficient storage systems with SSDs, and the acquisition of Velobit, which develops SSD optimization software, for an undisclosed amount. Most recently, WDC announced the acquisition of Virident Inc., for $685 million in September 2013, a provider of server-side flash storage solutions, one of the fastest growing segments in enterprise and cloud computing. While this transaction is estimated to value Virident at 6x sales, and therefore ostensibly not cheap, this was a strategically important and complementary acquisition which should enhance WDC's offering to the higher margin enterprise/SSD segment, and it must also be noted that Virident is on course for YoY sales growth of 140% in 2013, and is estimated to be growing at twice the rate of growth for the $4 billion server-side flash storage market segment. In my view, these acquisitions all constitute intelligent capital allocation decisions, with management employing relatively modest amounts of capital to acquire strategically important assets that increase the company's exposure to the high growth, high margin market segments.Secondly, in 2012 WDC announced two significant programs to return cash to shareholders during FY13, as part of a plan to return 50% of its FCF to shareholders, via a share repurchase programme and initiating a dividend. The Company repurchased 19 million shares at an average price of approx. $44 per share during FY13, significantly below my conservative estimate of intrinsic value for the business, thereby constituting an intelligent capital allocation decision by management. The share repurchase programme also has capacity to buy back a further $1.9 billion worth of shares through to 2017, and so will continue to create shareholder value at current prices. WDC also initiated a dividend during FY13, with a $240 million dividend declared for FY13 (and $181 million of this paid at year-end), representing a dividend yield of 1.6% based on the year-end market cap.While some may argue the institution of a dividend indicates that the Company has run out of ideas in terms of internal re-investment opportunities, I would argue this is not the case - WDC simply does not require all the cash it now generates to maintain and to continue to grow operations, and so the decision to return some cash to shareholders via a dividend indicates a clear recognition of shareholders' interests. Over time, I would expect the dividend to continue to grow at a sustainable level, given the Company's cash generating ability.My final assessment of management capability is again best articulated by Buffett, who in his 1984 shareholders' letter, stated ""that for every dollar retained by the corporation, at least one dollar of market value will be created for owners. This will happen only if the capital retained produces incremental earnings equal to, or above, those generally available to investors."" So how does WDC perform under this criteria? Quite well, based on a 5-year track record as espoused by Buffett himself. The table below summarizes this track record:As the analysis above shows, retained earnings of $4.9 billion over the 5-year period from 2009 to 2013 produced a $5.9 billion increase in market value (with minimal leverage). Furthermore, the result is even better if one were to assess the above using year-end market capitalisation figures, as WDC's market cap at 31 July 2013 was approx. $15.4 billion, meaning the same $4.9 billion in earnings retained over the period produced an increase of $9.8 billion in market value.In each regard, WDC management has demonstrated a consistent track record of prudently allocating capital, having delivered consistently high returns on capital, intelligently selecting strategic acquisitions without paying excessively for them, and delivering at least a $1.20 increase in market value for every dollar retained in the business.Management remuneration: given that WDC has historically been a highly cash generative business that has reached a dominant position as part of an industry duopoly, it is worthwhile examining how management have paid themselves. Have management steadily paid themselves more and more as the business has grown to its current position? Are there any indications of overly generous insider remuneration levels at the expense of the owners of the business? It does not appear so. The analysis below sets out the total remuneration for ""named executive officers"" of the company, that is the CEO, CFO, President, and various divisional head officers for a 5-year period from 2008 to 2012 (2013 not filed as of writing):Total compensation amounts outlined above comprise salary, bonus, stock awards, options awards, non-equity incentive plan compensation and other compensation disclosed. As the analysis shows, remuneration levels have remained broadly stable, averaging at 0.24% of revenues over the 5-year period. In 2012, remuneration levels were significantly higher than prior years due to the retirement of John F. Coyne as CEO, which triggered automatic vesting of stock options previously awarded to him, amounting to $6.3 million. Excluding this, total remuneration would have represented 0.26% of revenues. On this basis, it does not appear that WDC management have been drawing excessive remuneration from the company at the expense of shareholders.10. ValuationI have appraised WDC using two primary valuation methodologies:· DCF· EV/FCF multipleCompanies in the data storage industry tend to exhibit strong cash generation, with shorter cash conversion cycles than businesses operating in other industries. On this basis, free cash flow based methodologies are the most appropriate for valuing WDC. Both methods involve the conservative estimation of future FCF for WDC, which I outline below:Assumptions· Revenue split between Compute and Non-Compute in 2013 was 50%/50%; Compute revenues assumed to decline by 12% YoY from FY14 - FY17 - Gartner reported in June 2013 that worldwide PC shipments decline 11% YoY to June 2013, therefore analysis assumes this negative trend for PCs and consequently PC HDD units will continue. I believe this is extremely prudent given that IHS forecast that HDD storage will remain the prevailing medium in terms of market share for PC storage by 2017, at 64%, while WDC management projects that over 75% of exabytes in 2020 (or 4,425 exabytes) will be stored on HDDs.· Compute gross margin assumed to revert to pre-Thailand flood level of approximately 18% (note 2012 and 2013 margins were approx. 28%, so prudently assume decline in HDD margins given increased expected adoption of SSD, despite likely pricing power for WDC given duopoly with STX)· Non-Compute revenues (comprising non-PC related revenue streams of enterprise HDD, SSD, CE and Branded Products) leveraged to cloud computing, big data and consumers are assumed to increase by 15% per annum from FY14 through to FY17; I believe this projected growth rate is very reasonable, being below projected CAGR for general exabyte storage from 2012 to 2020 of 33% according to WDC as well as below the projected growth in SSD, ranging between 23% and 63% CAGR according to various industry analyst reports from IHS and IDC· Non-Compute gross margins are assumed to be maintained at 33%, based on current margin range achieved by both WDC and STX and in line 5-year average margins achieved by enterprise and SSD storage providers such as SanDisk, STEC and Fusion-io.· Overall I assume revenues are projected to grow at 5.9% CAGR over the next 5 years in my model, which I believe is extremely conservative in the context of the growth outlook for data storage and WDC's track record (10-year CAGR of 19.7%)· Opex assumed to represent 15% of revenues going forward, in line with 2013 and 2012 levels, but above pre-2013 5-year average of 10.9%, to reflect likely increased R&D spend requirement going forward given advances in SSD technology and WDC's increased exposure to this segment· Depreciation & Amortisation is assumed to be 7.6% of revenues, based on 2013 and 2012 levels, reflecting steady rate post-HGST acquisition· No incremental working capital requirement is assumed based on 2011-2013 trend· Capex is assumed at 6.9% based on 2011-2013 trend, and approximates depreciation. This is also in line with capex rates for other storage businesses, including pure enterprise and SSD providers; therefore no incremental capex is assumed to be required for WDC as it furthers transition from a traditional HDD manufacturer to HDD and enterprise and SSD- business· Resulting free cash flow margin from these projections ranges from 12% - 15%, in line with WDC's 5-year historic range of 9.2% - 18.8%; therefore I conclude these projections to be reasonable· As a sense check, my projected CAGR for revenues and free cash flow appear reasonable at 5.8% and 12.1% respectively, versus WDC's historic 10-year track record of 19.7% and 32.6% respectivelyI believe the above analysis presents a conservative estimate of WDC's sustainable free cash flow or earnings power for valuing the business.DCF Valuation:The above DCF valuation analysis assumes the following:· Discounting using mid-year convention at a rate of 15%, being my required after-tax rate of return on my investments; terminal growth rate assumed to be 2%· Deduction of total debt per most recent 10-Q filing for the quarter ended 30 September 2013· Deduction of pension-underfunded balance, operating lease obligations and Seagate litigation settlement as disclosed per 31 July 2013 year-end 10-K and most recent 10-Q filing· Add back of $4.5 billion, being my estimate of excess cash (vs. gross cash balance of $4.8 billion per 10-Q at 30 September 2013)· Implied valuation of $22 billion, or $93 per share on a fully diluted basis (242 million shares per 10-Q at 30 September 2013)EV/FCF valuationThe above EV/FCF valuation analysis assumes the following:· Sustainable FCF of $2.4 billion as per projections outlined above· Multiple range of 8x - 10x used, given quality of cash earnings and growth prospects, with WDC having a dominant HDD position and strong growth outlook for its nascent SSD business· Additionally, upper range of 10x multiple is further supported by market valuations for relevant comparable businesses in the data storage industry at present:· Excluding outliers highlighted, an 8.0x - 10x EV/FCF multiple appears reasonable for a business of WDC's quality and prospects. This implies a valuation for WDC's equity of $21 billion - $26 billion or $86 - $106 per share on a fully diluted basis (242 million shares per 10-Q at 30 September 2013)11. RisksI believe the following represent the primary risks to my appraisal of WDC:Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in WDC over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1638802,48501,2013-08-15T14:42:36-04:00,,"Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) is a global developer and manufacturer of electronic storage products. The company offers a range of products which include hard disk drives, solid state drives, and solid state hybrid drives. Western's management used the cash from operations to invest in acquisitions that should improve the firm's results of operations, such as the acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd., HGST.The electronic storage industry is cyclical and benefits from expansionary monetary policy. That, expansionary monetary policy, and key strategic acquisitions have helped Western's share price increase almost 100% since December of 2012. The company's historic returns have beaten the S&P 500 by a wide margin, which could suggest a period of underperformance may be coming.That said, I think the company's results of operations in fiscal 2013 will be adversely impacted by declining PC sales; that will act as a headwind to already extended valuations. But, declining PC sales could be offset by strength in the Enterprise and Non-Compute segments as well as new offerings in the mobile space.I think the management of Western's cash flow is providing it with a competitive advantage to rival Seagate (NASDAQ:STX). But, based on my models, the common equity shares are overvalued, and I can't put money to work long the stock unless it declines 20+% -- assuming the valuation stays the same.RisksRecent DevelopmentsBusiness ProfileWestern Digital is an industry-leading developer and manufacturer of storage products that enable people to create, manage, experience and preserve digital content. The company designs and makes storage devices, networking equipment and home entertainment products under the WD, HGST and G-Technology brands. Western serves each of the primary markets addressing storage opportunities -- enterprise and cloud data centers, client, consumer electronics, backup, the Internet and other emerging markets such as automotive and home and small office networking.Western's principal products are hard drives, which use one or more rotating magnetic disks to store and allow fast access to data. Hard drives are today's primary storage medium for digital content. Further, hard drives are used in desktop and notebook computers, multiple types of data centers including private and public cloud data centers, home entertainment equipment and stand-alone consumer storage devices. Western also offers solid-state drives, home entertainment and networking products and applications for network backup, smart phones and tablets.The company mainly sells its products in Asia and its distribution channel is primarily comprised of OEMs, but includes distributors and retailers.There are three main operating segments: Compute, Non-Compute, and Enterprise. Most of the unit shipments are generated from the Compute segment, with Non-Compute representing the second largest segment.During the quarter ended March 29, 2013, 45% of Western's revenue came from sales to its top 10 customers. Those customers have bargaining power as they have a multiple suppliers to select from and therefore the company lacks pricing power and the ability to pass increases in costs along to customers.Western Digital purchases supplies from a limited number of suppliers. Thus, its suppliers have bargaining power, which could result in a higher cost of revenues and a lower gross margin and cash flow from operations. Also, shareholders' equity and EPS wouldn't increase as much as it would if the company's suppliers didn't have bargaining power.Consumers traditionally have stored their data on their PC, often supplemented with personal external storage devices. Most businesses also include similar local storage as a primary or secondary storage location. This storage is typically provided by hard disk drives. Over the last few years, cloud computing has emerged whereby applications and data are hosted, accessed and processed through a third-party provider over a broadband Internet connection, potentially reducing or eliminating the need for, among other things, significant storage inside the accessing computer. Cloud computing poses significant potential downside risks to Western Digital's results of operations.Also, Western's customers' storage needs could be satisfied at lower prices with lower capacity hard drives or solid-state storage products that the company does not offer, thereby decreasing Western's revenue or putting the company at a disadvantage to competing storage technologies. As a result, even with increasing aggregate demand for digital storage, if Western fails to anticipate or respond timely to developments in the demand for storage, its ASPs could decline, which could adversely affect operating results.SSDs have no moving mechanical components. This distinguishes them from traditional electromechanical magnetic disks such as hard disk drives [HDDs] or floppy disks, which contain spinning disks and movable read/write heads. Compared with electromechanical disks, SSDs are typically more resistant to physical shock, run more quietly, have lower access time, and less latency. However, while the price of SSDs has continued to decline, SSDs are still about 7 to 8 times more expensive per unit of storage than HDDs.Hybrid drives or solid state hybrid drives [SSHD] combine the features of SSDs and HDDs in the same unit, containing a large hard disk drive and an SSD cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data. These devices may offer near-SSD performance for many applications.Most of the advantages of solid-state drives over traditional hard drives are due to their ability to access data completely electronically instead of electromechanically, resulting in superior transfer speeds and mechanical ruggedness. On the other hand, hard disk drives offer significantly higher capacity for their price.SSDs have faster start-up times, random access times, read latency times, and data transfer rates than HDDs. Also, SSDs can tolerate higher temperatures and use substantially less power.There continues to be a rapid growth in devices that do not contain a hard drive, such as tablet computers and smart phones. As tablet computers and smart phones provide many of the same capabilities as PCs, they have displaced or materially affected, and may continue to displace or materially affect, the demand for PCs. That could cause demand for Western's products to decrease.Western Digital acquired Hitachi Global Storage Technologies Holdings Pte. Ltd., HGST, from Hitachi Ltd. for $4.7 billion. HGST is a developer and manufacturer of storage devices. Goodwill represented 38% of the purchase price, a fair amount compared to other acquisitions.Financial Performance ForecastThe acquisition of HGST added $3.1 billion to net revenue in fiscal 2012; absent the acquisition, net revenue would have declined to $9.4 billion from $9.5 billion in fiscal 2011 and $9.85 billion in fiscal 2010. Revenue in fiscal 2013 increased to $15.35 billion from $12.48 billion in fiscal 2012. Fiscal 2012 includes only half a year of HGST operating results; fiscal 2013 includes a full year of HGST operating results. In an attempt to compare apples to apples, revenue declined from $4.75 billion in fiscal fourth quarter of 2012 to $3.73 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2013; I expected declining revenues as hard drive sales decline on softer demand. The increase in revenue because of the acquisition masks the weakness in demand for the firm's products. But, industry consolidation is a positive for valuations longer term as consolidation could increase pricing power.The impact of the acquisition makes it more challenging to model this company's results for fiscal 2014. That said, I think there will be continued weakness in desktop and notebook sales; but, I think consumer electronics and branded enterprise could show strength. Overall, I think revenue could decline 3% to 5%; that would put fiscal 2014 revenue between $14.58 billion and $14.89 billion.Relative to fiscal 2013, I think the operating margin will contract from 15.7% to 13%, which is slightly below the low end of the company's guidance. But, I think the net income margin stays roughly the same at about 11%. Consequently, I am looking for operating income in the $1.9 billion to $1.94 billion range and net income in the $1.6 billion to $1.64 billion range.The financial performance in fiscal 2014 should act as a headwind to the valuations. That said, Western Digital is liquid and solvent. The company keeps a larger cash pile than rival Seagate, which I think is better for the long-term prospects of the company. For example, Western was able to spend $4.7 billion acquiring HGST, which was accretive to operations. In terms of cash management, I think Western has the competitive advantage.ValuationsI'm going to use discounted cash flows and multipliers to value the common equity shares of Western Digital. In fiscal 2013, the company paid $1.00 of dividends; I think the payout ratio is on the low side. Thus, I am modeling a 25% percent increase in the fiscal 2014 dividend to $1.25/share.Discounted cash flow models are sensitive to changes in the assumptions. Given the facts surrounding this company, I think the most reasonable estimate of intrinsic value using discounted cash flows is $62.50.Moving on to the justified value, I estimate the justified price/earnings ratio as 10. Currently, the price/earnings ratio is 9.92. Thus, the intrinsic value using this metric is $68.85.Now, I will use the historic multiplier model valuations to value the common equity shares. Using the price/earnings ratio, the intrinsic value is $58.77. The intrinsic value using the price/book ratio is $53.92 and is $54.64, using the price/sales ratio. The intrinsic value using the price/cash flow ratio is $55.49. Consequently, the average intrinsic value using this model is $55.71.The average intrinsic value of the three models and the intrinsic value of the common equity shares of Western Digital Corporation is $62.35. Western Digital Corporation is overvalued by 9.5%. I would use a 20+% decline in the share price to accumulate shares, $54.64 or less.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The purchase brings the company's total tab on spending in the fast-growing market to more than $1bn.Earlier this year, Western Digital agreed to pay $340m for flash drive vendor STEC, as well as an undisclosed amount for VeloBit, an early-stage maker of software for boosting the performance of flash drives. That's on top of the $4.25bn it spent in early 2011 on Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, a deal that was driven in part to help Western Digital get into the enterprise flash market.Virident brings Western Digital PCIe flash cards (essentially flash drives that are used for high-performance applications) and related software. Virident is an early-stage company and Western Digital doesn't expect it to be accretive until 2015. Subscribers to The 451 M&A KnowledgeBase can see our full record and estimates of Virident's revenue.The sinking cost of flash and rising demand for faster storage is leading to a growing market for enterprise flash at the expense of traditional hard disk. According to TheInfoPro, a service of 451 Research, 17% of IT departments plan to increase their spending on flash memory in servers (Virident's specialty), up from just 8% that planned to do so in 2012.Western Digital has been far more aggressive than its competition in the flash sector. For instance, SanDisk launched itself into the flash disk market two years ago with the $327m reach for Pliant Technology and, more recently, the $307m pickup of another flash disk provider, SMART Storage Systems. Western Digital's main rival, Seagate, has yet to ink a deal in flash. However, it did make a $40m investment in Virident earlier this year.Recent deals by disk drive companiesSource: The 451 M&A KnowledgeBaseDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1682392,25120,2013-09-09T16:44:17-04:00,,"Shares of Western Digital (WDC) hardly moved on the news of yet another deal to bolster its presence in the enterprise SSD market.The third acquisition within three months' time underscores Western Digital's commitment to the enterprise SSD market to bolster future growth, its competitive position, and the offerings in the software market.The solid financial position, appealing valuation, and commitment to create future shareholder value makes me optimistic about the long-term prospects of the firm.The DealWestern Digital announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement under which it will acquire Virident Systems.Western Digital will pay $685 million in cash for the provider of server-side flash storage solutions.Virident focuses on technology for the enterprise and cloud-computing industry. Virident's offerings provide customers with server-side flash storage, which accelerates virtualization, database and cloud-computing solutions. Key in all this is the FlashMAX II product.With the deal, Western Digital and is subsidiary Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST), will boost the presence in the enterprise SSD market. The market for enterprise SSDs is expected to nearly triple between 2012 and 2017, growing towards $7 billion in 2017.Combined with Virident, HGST can increase go-market times and boost the value of its offerings to customers. The increasing storage demand and capacity boost the importance of intelligent storage solutions. The 175 employees of the Virident, which was founded as recently as 2006, will become part of HSGT. CEO Steve Milligan commented on the rationale behind the deal:The deal is of a highly strategic nature, and will not add meaningfully to earnings and revenues in the short term, although Western Digital believes the deal will add to non-GAAP earnings in 2015.The deal is subject to normal closing conditions, including regulatory review, and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2013. Early strategic investors in Virident include Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC).ValuationWestern Digital ended its fiscal year of 2013 with $4.31 billion in cash and equivalents. The company operates with $1.95 billion in total debt, for a net cash position of around $2.36 billion.Annual revenues for the year came in at $15.35 billion, up 23.0% on the year before. Net income rose slightly to $1.7 billion, coming in at $6.75 per share.Trading around $65 per share, the market values Western Digital at $15.5 billion, valuing operating assets of the firm at $13.2 billion. This values operating assets of the firm at 0.85 times annual revenues and 7-8 times annual earnings.Western Digital pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, for an annual dividend yield of 1.5%.Some Historical PerspectiveThe long-term performance of Western Digital has been a success story. Over the past decade, shares have almost 10-folded from levels around $7 in 2004, to highs of $70 in recent weeks.As a matter of fact, shares have returned some 55% in 2013 alone, as operating performance kept improving. Between the fiscal year of 2010 and 2013, revenues rose by a cumulative 56% to $15.4 billion.Investment ThesisWestern Digital continues to commit to solid-state drives, as it battles with Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) to be a leader in the fast growing market for SSDs used in servers. Crucial in all these developments is the blurring of functions and integration of database applications, processing and actual storage.Western Digital, which is focused on hard disk-drive markets has shifted its focus to faster and more energy efficient solid-sate drives to combat the slowing PC market.The rumors about further consolidation in the market has pushed up shares of competitor Fusion-IO (NYSE:FIO) by almost 25% in Monday's trading session.Analysts expect that the company will be acquired by Seagate, which is left out after missing out on Virident. Seagate already publicly announced its intentions in the field. Western Digital admitted on the conference call that there were other bidders involved for the company.Back in June, when Western Digital announced the acquisition of troubled SSD producer STEC for $340 million, I last took a look at the company's prospects. Ever since, shares have risen from $60 to highs of $70, currently trading at $65 per share. Just like that deal with STEC, it is not about the current revenues or earnings, which the companies contribute. Rather it is the promising build up of a fast growing division, driving future revenue and earnings growth.These deals are of a highly strategic nature, as Western Digital has already spent a combined $1 billion to acquire STEC and Virident. The fact that this second deal takes place within three months of STEC just shows the commitment the company has made. In the meantime, the company acquired privately held VeloBit as well, for an undisclosed sum.I applaud management's strategy. The company is willing to invest 5% of its market capitalization in another promising firm to built an anchor for future growth. For the full year of 2013, the Enterprise SSD business generated annual revenues of $355 million. The move away from hardware into software, might boost valuation multiples along the road as well.Yet the company holds sufficient cash to finance these deals, still operating with a solid net cash position following the deal. Solid operating cash flows continue to provide a source of cash to be deployed in the meantime.The overall valuation remains appealing enough despite an almost 10% run up over the past three months, and year-to-date returns of 55%. I remain cautiously optimistic given the solid state of finances, the appealing valuation at 8 times last year's earnings despite the cyclical nature of the business, and management's commitment to bolster the strategic foundation of the firm.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1546662,48501,2013-07-12T13:52:33-04:00,,"SanDisk (SNDK) is coming off of a year of poor financial performance. But, the stock price has done very well over the last several months. The company is introducing new products and this year should be better from a financial performance perspective.With that said, it seems as though the market priced in the better performance for this year as valuations are near peaks. That said, I expect continued strong performance this year with some potential weakness, or buying opportunities, later in the year. The share price has performed so well that it may be difficult for SanDisk to beat the already high expectations; that could provide some buying opportunities.Consequently, a dip to the $47-$57 range would provide an excellent opportunity to get long shares of SanDisk. SanDisk remains well positioned to benefit from increasing data consumption and storage.Recent DevelopmentsSanDisk announced the SanDisk Extreme microSDHC and microSDXC UHS-I memory cards, which are designed for smartphones, tablets and cameras. The 64GB microSDXC UHS-I memory card is the world's fastest with up to 80MB/sec read and up to 50MB/sec write speeds.The company also announced three USB flash drives, the SanDisk Ultra USB 3.0, Cruzer Orbit, and Cruzer Force USB flash drives. The SanDisk Ultra USB 3.0 flash drive transfers files up to four times faster than regular USB 2.0 drives. The Cruzer Orbit USB flash drive offers an easy and convenient way to store, transfer and share data in 360-degree swivel design. The Cruzer Force USB is built with a durable metal casing.SanDisk announced an agreement to acquire SMART Storage Systems, a developer of enterprise solid state drives based on the SATA and SAS storage protocols. SanDisk is paying about $307 to acquire SMART Storage Systems. The deal is expected to close in August, 2013. This acquisition enables SanDisk to address a $1.6 billion market opportunity in enterprise SATA products, and complements SanDisk's SAS product portfolio. The impact of this acquisition is expected to be slightly dilutive to SanDisk's non-GAAP earnings per share in the second half of 2013 and become accretive to earnings in 2014.SanDisk expanded its solid state drive [SSD] portfolio with the addition of three new models (SanDisk Extreme II SSD, SanDisk U110 SSD, and SanDisk X110 SSD). The SanDisk Extreme II SSD improves the performance of notebook computers and desktops. The other two SSDs improve the performance of ultra-thin notebooks and tablets.None of the recent developments is too exciting; they are product upgrades.Segment AnalysisThere are two main sources of revenue: product revenue, and license and royalty revenue. There is also revenue that comes from commercial and revenue from retail. I provide forecasts for all four of these divisions.I'm forecasting revenue from commercial to be slightly stronger than FY 2012. Revenue should be in the $2.9 billion to $3.3 billion range. Revenue in FY 2012 was $2.83 billion. Revenue in the second quarter should be between $700 million and $850 million.Revenue from retail should increase relative to fiscal year 2012. I'm expecting revenue in the $1.85 billion to $2 billion range. Fiscal year 2012 revenue was $1.85 billion. Revenue in the second quarter should be $450 million to $550 million.Product revenue should be in the $4.75 billion to $5.3 billion range in fiscal 2013. License and royalty revenue should be roughly flat at $374 million.Thus, SanDisk should report a good year relative to 2012, but probably below the fiscal 2011 level.Consolidated's Forecast & ValuationsIn terms of the second quarter, I am looking for revenue in the $1.15 billion to $1.4 billion range; revenue in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 was $1.03 billion. Operating income is challenging to predict; so, I am going to use a conservative operating margin. Operating income should be in the $184 million to $280 million range. Net income should be in the $103.5 million to $168 million range.I'm expecting consolidated revenue in the $5.12 billion to $5.67 billion range in fiscal 2013. Operating income should be in the $819 million to $1.14 billion range. Net income should be in the $461 million to $680 million range. All three measures of profitability should be above their 2012 comparisons.The share count is trending higher; thus, the pace of earnings growth needs to outpace the pace of share count growth, which generally is happening.Relative to its 5-year average, SanDisk is overvalued. The same can be said for the comparison with the S&P 500 and on a time series basis. So, SanDisk is overvalued.The market seems to have priced in the improved prospects for SanDisk relative to the prior year.Share Price ForecastThe uptrend lifting the share price is pretty strong. Consequently, I believe the top will be in place at roughly the $70 level. But, I will model the $63 level and the $70 level for potential entry zones. Granted, SanDisk could face a decline of primary degree.From the $63 level, the entry range would be $47-$53.50. From the $70 level, the entry range would be $52.50-$59.50. The financial performance should act as a tailwind to valuations.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1552072,23479,2013-07-17T05:12:07-04:00,,"SanDisk Corporation (NASDAQ:SNDK), a leader in flash memory storage solutions, is set to release its Q2 Fiscal 2013 earnings on Wednesday, July 17. We expect the company to post double-digit growth on a year-over-year basis, mainly on the back of SSD products. A significant depreciation in the Japanese yen should also result in a substantial improvement in its gross and operating margins. In Q1 earnings, we saw signs of NAND price stabilization and a sequential improvement in average selling price (ASP) for the second consecutive quarter. We will be closely watching Q2 earnings to see how well this trend continues to benefit the company.In Q1 fiscal 2013 earnings, the company beat market expectations with total revenues of $1.34 billion, an 11% increase on a year-over-year basis. Operating income surged over 32% to cross $2.5 billion. Below we take a look at key trends impacting SanDisk during Q2.NAND Flash Prices StabilizingWhile the demand for NAND flash has been rapidly growing in line with smartphones sales, a major drag on SanDisk's profitability over the last year has been a decline in NAND flash prices. However, there have been signs of some improvements in the NAND flash industry pricing as a whole due to favorable demand / supply scenario. A large number of NAND flash manufacturers have kept cutting capital expenditures over the past couple of months, which has helped bring stability to NAND flash prices. In Q1 2013 earnings, while the ASP declined 18% on a y-o-y basis, the company reported a sequential price increase of 2%. This was on top of a 7% price increase in Q4 2012. We will be closely watching what SanDisk's management has to say about NAND flash prices to better understand how it fared compared with its competitors. In Q1, SanDisk's ASPs improved when compared with a slight decline witnessed by its competitor Micron (NASDAQ:MU).SSD Will Be The Major Growth DriverSanDisk's SSD sales contribution to company's total revenues jumped significantly in Q1. It now makes up approximately 20% of the total revenues, up from 10% in the Q4 Fiscal 2012. We expect the division to continue to register rapid growth as SSDs seem to be taking over traditional hard drives as the primary form of storage on laptops and enterprise servers. The key for SanDisk in this segment is enterprise SSD demand, which is being fueled by the movement towards the cloud. Cloud servers need fast hard drives to locate consumer data quickly, and SSDs are the best options for enterprise servers at present. The company now supplies SSDs to 10 leading PC OEMs. These partnerships with OEMs should help the company establish an even stronger foothold in a growing industry.Yen Weakness To Continue To Boost MarginsSanDisk reported solid gross margin growth in the last quarter and we expect this trend to continue due to continued depreciation in Japanese yen (JPY). SanDisk's yen-based wafer purchases constitute close to two-thirds of its cost of sales, and weakness in JPY makes SanDisk's yen-based wafer purchases cheaper. It is worth noting that the company's yen exchange rate in its cost of sales was approximately 90 JPY per dollar in Q4 2012 and around 95 JPY in Q1 2013. Yen has fallen since then to cross 100 JPY per dollar. These wafer purchases are reflected in cost of sales with approximately a 3-month lag.

These drives are used everywhere digital information and content is found: in mobile devices; in business and personal computers; in external storage devices; in the digital video recorder in your home; and in sophisticated medical, military, aerospace, automotive, manufacturing and telecommunications systems. Customers range from the individual consumer (like you) to the largest corporations to big government.In a July 2, 2013 presentation, Western Digital shared its view of the coming boom in digital data. The company predicts a 34% compound annual growth rate through 2020:As can be seen by the slide, the largest growth is expected to be in the Enterprise Systems and Client market segments. So we are talking ""cloud"" and ""big data"" here. According to market data shown in the presentation, these two market segments are dominated by HDDs today and are expected, along with SSDs, to dominate the market in 2020.Megatrends driving the growth in digital storage requirements are in fields as diverse as human genome data, social media, consumer, and content digitization of old media (paper, film, CDs, etc). With recent revelations about eavesdropping by the National Security Administration (""NSA"") and cyber-theft by the Chinese, it is clear big governments will be storing huge quantities of ""metadata."" One of the slides in the WDC presentation says the NSA's ""Boundless Informant"" tool enabled it to view 3 billion pieces of intelligence in a 30-day period on its US network, and 97 billion pieces worldwide as of March 2013.The NSA's Utah Data Center in Bluffdale, UtahA recent article on Fox News reported that the NSA's new Utah Data center is a 1.5 million square foot building filled with super-computers designed to store massive amounts of information gathered from phone calls, emails, and online activity. James Bamford, the author of several books on the NSA and who last year wrote about the Utah center in Wired magazine, says it will be the central depository for everything the NSA intercepts -- in effect, functioning as the agency's ""cloud."" Bamford believes the facility will be able to hold a so-called yottabyte of information, the largest measurement computer scientists have. A yottabyte is equal to 500 quintillion pages of text.These very large ""metadata"" storage requirements are likely to be satisfied with storage devices like those in WDC's multi-disk helium filled HDD product line. Take the UltraStart 7K3000, for instance. This drive is a 5-platter platform with the following specs:What else could a 24x7x365 enterprise-class application ask for out of a storage device? Answer: more storage! With the smaller footprint of this product, the company says it is now possible to achieve a colossal 1.8 PB (petabyte) of storage in the footprint of a standard 19-inch enterprise storage rack by stacking ten 4U, 60-bay enclosures.It's clear the world's digital data storage requirements are growing at a phenomenal rate. It's also clear Western Digital has the products to satisfy the requirements of the demand for data storage. But will these fundamentals push the stock up? In a word: Yes.CompetitionThere are basically two large HDD companies left: Western Digital merged with Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (the origin of WDC's ""HGST"" product line) last year, and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) merged with Samsung Electronics' HDD business in 2011. Toshiba is still hanging on, but in my opinion is a tier-2 player. In addition to acquiring their competitors, the hard drive manufacturers have been acquiring companies along the supply chain, such as companies that produce components of the drives. Basically, WDC and Seagate own this market.When it comes to something like the NSA, most all government programs require second sourcing of components. Hard drives manufactured by different competitors are highly substitutable. As a result, I believe WDC and STX will roughly share this market opportunity.HDD makers often compete on the basis of price, quality, reliability, performance and storage capacity. As technology advances, storage density and drive speed (performance) continue to increase. Like any technology, this often results in price erosion of older models. So the industry is characterized by times of intense pricing pressure followed by new technological innovations and margin expansion. But with the consolidation of the last 2 years, Western Digital and Seagate have basically reduced the field from four major players to two. This reduces WDC's historical competitive threat and, I believe, overall margin pressure.Financial PerformanceAccording to the company's 2012 annual report, net revenue was $12.5 billion for 2012 -- an increase of 31% from 2011. Operations from HGST contributed $3.1 billion in net revenue. Enterprise unit shipments rose 60% from 10 to 16 million. Not surprisingly, there followed a $17 increase in ASP from $45 to $62. For the year, net income was $1.6 billion -- up 12.9% year-over-year. Gross margins were close to 30%.2012's financial performance was exceptional considering the industry's hard drive shipments decreased from 657 to 599 million units. This reflected flood-related supply constraints in Thailand and a consumer transition away from PCs to tablets (""SSD"" instead of ""HDD"") and smartphones. However, according to the annual report, WDC captured an amazing 45% of the total HDD market.Cash flow from operations grew substantially in 2012 as a result of the HGST takeover:As did shareholder equity:RisksThe risks going forward include a weakening world economy, a more rapid decline in PC shipments without a corresponding increase in shipments for tablets, enterprise and client shipments, as well as competition resulting in a decline in ASPs. Also, as a result of the HGST acquisition, net cash was reduced by 2/3 in 2012 and long-term debt at fiscal year end was $1.95 billion. The company will need a firm market over the next 12 months to bring debt-to-equity back to more a more normal ratio.In addition to these risks, the HDD and SDD markets are highly technical fields. The mobile market has increased the demand for smaller, thinner, lighter, and quieter high performance storage products. All this much be achieved with a highly reliable product line along with a steady reduction in cost per storage unit. As a result, WDC must fund a robust R&D budget:That said, I believe the huge uptick in R&D spending in 2012 reflected the HGST acquisition. I would expect redundancies and synergies across the two R&D engineering operations will allow the company to trim costs and return to a more normal year-over-year increase.WDC data by YChartsCurrent ValuationAccording to Yahoo finance, WDC currently has a P/E=8.5 and trailing twelve month earnings of $7.93. It pays a dividend of $1/share and currently yields 1.5%.S&P estimates WDC will earn $8.30 for fiscal year 2013, $7.62 in 2014, and $7.58 in 2015. Analysts' concerns over pricing pressure and lackluster end demand for HDD products will, they say, constrain earnings for the foreseeable future. I disagree. While I will concede the PC market will continue to contract, I think we will see a move to higher margin HDD products in the enterprise and client markets as a result of the phenomenal growth in metadata applications from private industry and governments. This market growth, combined with WDC's 45% market share (according to the annual report), could enable WDC to earn $10/share in 2015. Why? Because I expect WDC will continue to see expanded ASPs similar to what was experienced in 2012. I also believe there will be some R&D duplications rung out of WDC's R&D operations -- and these savings will move to the bottom line. In addition, I expect P/E expansion as the market realizes and factors in the phenomenal growth rate in worldwide storage requirements. With a P/E of 10 and $10/share earnings, WDC could hit $100/share by 2015.Summary And ConclusionWestern Digital Corporation is a market leader in the HDD market. Due to industry consolidation over the past two years, WDC and Seagate are now the two major players. Due to the interoperability of HDDs, most corporations and governments will second source their storage units in order to reduce mission critical storage risks. Assuming continued engineering and manufacturing execution, this means WDC and STX will basically share the majority of the fast growing digital data storage market, a market expected to grow at a 30%+ compound annual growth rate until the year 2020. As a result, shares in WDC will see an expansion in both earnings and valuation metrics. The company could earn $10/share by 2015 and the market could easily expand the P/E to 10, resulting in a $100 share price.For those investors willing to assume the risks discussed in this article, WDC is a Buy.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in WDC over the next 72 hours.

1541132,32001,2013-07-09T16:25:12-04:00,,"SanDisk (SNDK) reports its 2nd-quarter, 2013 financial results after the bell on Wednesday, July 17. Analyst consensus is looking for $0.92 in earnings per share [EPS] on $1.392 billion in revenue for expected year-over-year growth of 300% and 35% respectively.EPS and revenue estimates continue to be revised higher for SNDK since the April 13, earnings release.It was the first and 2nd quarters of 2012, where the wheels really came off the cart for SNDK, as inventory swelled, flash memory pricing collapsed, and gross margin plummeted from 43% in 4th-quarter 2011, to 33% in 1st-quarter 2012, to 27% in the 2nd-quarter 2012.No question SNDK is hitting on all cylinders currently, with the big difference being that managements of both SNDK and Micron (NASDAQ:MU) are saying ""it's different this time"" in terms of production capacity being boosted, which is what causes these horrific cycles in the NAND and DRAM memory markets.As our best-performing stock in Q1 13, up 25% and with SNDK up again 12% in the 2nd quarter of 2013, we recently took the opportunity to sell half of our position.To be frank, I've been burned on the semiconductor cycle before with the stock, as EPS is uber-volatile on pricing and production swings, so even though we believe management to some extent that the capacity and pricing cycle could last longer this upswing, why get greedy when we had anywhere between a 40% to 80% in the stock off 2012's lows near $30.There are several positives to SNDK as it sits today near $60:Valuation: after EPS fell 50% in 2012, EPS growth in 2013 is currently expected at +72%, which leaves a blended growth rate of 23% between the two years. EPS growth for 2014 and 2015 is expected to slow to mid teens, as revenue growth is expected at +15%, 10% and 10% the next three years.Trading at 14(x) cash-flow and 13(x) the expected 2013 estimate, the real struggle I have always had with the stock is, ""what are core or peak earnings"" for SNDK?We modeled the company since 1995, and tracked revenue and EPS since then and using current 2013 - 2015 forward estimates as well as historical estimates over the last 20 years, the ""average"" EPS for SNDK is $3 per share.Personally I think ""core"" EPS (i.e earnings power) is closer to $4 per share, so with a 10(x) multiple, the stock could be thought to be fairly valued at $40, undervalued at $30 and overvalued at $50.Now, what if this capacity and pricing cycle is different? What if MU and SNDK are right and less capacity will be brought online in late 2013, and what if pricing stays firm? SNDK's current forward 4-quarter EPS estimate is $4.25, so if $5 is peak earnings for this cycle, then the stock could trade to $70 - $75 on a 15(x) multiple of peak earnings, and if $6 is peak earnings for this cycle then the stock could make a run at $79 or the January, 2006 high.Technicals: since we last updated readers on SNDK, the stock has traded above its $53 January, 2012 high, and seems to be consolidating in the high $50s - low $60s in July. To make a run at the high $70s high from early 2006, SNDK investors would have to hear about strong 2nd-half guidance for 2013.Conclusion: we halved our position as we think a lot of good news is currently in SNDK's stock price, but we also kept half to see if the favorable conditions can continue into the 2nd half of 2013.This is a remarkably volatile stock in a remarkably tough sector.Guidance and how the stock reacts following earnings next week will be key to what we do with the remainder of our position. We expect a very strong 2nd-quarter earnings report for SNDK, but we also wonder how much is in the stock.Disclosure: I am long SNDK, MU.

1522432,25120,2013-06-26T11:54:01-04:00,,"Shares of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) are trading with losses of up to 3% in Monday's trading session amidst the general market sell-off, after the company announced the strategic acquisition of STEC (NASDAQ:STEC).The strategic deal underlies Western Digital's strategy to diversify its operations and reinforce its position within solid state drives (SSDs).The DealWestern Digital announced that it has entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Western Digital's HGST unit will acquire STEC for $6.85 per share in cash.In total, Western Digital will spend $340 million to acquire the early innovator in enterprise solid state drives. Excluding the net cash position of STEC, the enterprise value comes in at just $207 million. The deal represents an 88% premium compared to STEC's closing price of $3.59 on Friday.With the acquisition, HGST accelerates its participation of enterprise SSDs. The deal has no implications to the joint development program with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), as Western continues to deliver SAS-based SSD products with the firm.STEC has seen a dramatic year in 2012 as revenues fell by 45% to $168.3 million. The company reported a $103.2 million loss compared to a $25.1 million profit a year earlier. Operating with $132 million in cash and equivalents, and not having any debt outstanding, operating assets are valued at $207 million. This values the company at roughly 1.2 times annual revenues.The board of directions of STEC and a special committee of independent directors have already unanimously approved the deal. Directors and executive officers have already voted in favor of the proposed deal.The deal is subject to normal closing conditions, and is expected to close in the third or fourth quarter of 2013.ValuationWestern Digital ended its third quarter with $4.06 billion in cash and equivalents. The company operates with $2.01 billion in total debt, for a solid net cash position of just above the $2 billion mark.For the year ending in June 2012, Western Digital generated revenues of $12.5 billion, up 30% on the year before. Net income more than doubled to $1.61 billion in the meantime.For the first nine months of its fiscal 2013, the company has reported a 50% increase in revenues, coming in at $11.6 billion. Net earnings rose by 44% to $1.25 billion. Full year revenues are expected to come in a touch above $15 billion, while earnings could come in around $1.6-$1.7 billion.Trading around $59 per share, the market values Western Digital at around $14 billion. This values operating assets of the firm at $12.0 billion, equivalent to 0.8 times expected annual revenues for 2013 and 7-8 times annual earnings.Western Digital currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share for an annual dividend yield of 1.7%.Some Historical PerspectiveWestern Digital has created a lot of value over the past decade for its shareholders. Shares steadily rose from lows of $7 in 2004 to peak at $40 in 2008 before falling back towards $10 later that year amidst the financial crisis.From that point in time shares have recovered, trading in a steady $25-$45 trading range, before breaking out to highs of $65 earlier this year.Between its fiscal 2009 and 2012, Western Digital has increased its annual revenues by two-thirds towards $12.5 billion. Net income more than tripled to $1.61 billion in the meantime.Investment ThesisA deal like the one with STEC is just a drop in the bucket for a firm the size of Western Digital. The $168 million in annual revenues could increase 2013's revenues by just a percent, while it does have a small negative impact on earnings.While the company pays a generous premium for the troubled company, the actual amounts regarding the deal are rather modest. The transaction is of a highly strategic nature. STEC's shares, which peaked at $40 in 2009, have fallen ever since on the back of being outpaced by competition and insider trading scandals. The latest quarterly results reveal that revenues just totaled $22 million for the past quarter, implying that revenues could fall another 50% on an annual basis.As such, Western Digital is purely buying the firm for the technology in an attempt to boost its position as a top player in the solid-state drive industry. STEC is one of the oldest makers of solid state drives, which are faster and more reliable, compared to traditional hard drives. Yet STEC has seen increased competition from Western Digital itself, but also from Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Fusion-io (NYSE:FIO).As CEO Milligan notes, the deal is a building block as SSDs become increasingly more important to the company within the storage industry. Western Digital continues to diversify away from personal computer sales into short-term data storage, heavily used by mobile device users.All in all the deal is just a modest addition, and is certainly no deal changer for Western. While growth is slowing down, the valuation is quite appealing amidst a rock-solid balance sheet and decent profitability. As the growth slowdown could weigh on shares going forward, the overall valuation appears appealing enough to be cautiously optimistic regarding Western Digital's medium to long-term prospects.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1505742,50151,2013-06-17T12:25:27-04:00,,"I have previously briefly covered Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) as a portion of my dividend portfolio for the strong-stomached. STX has had a huge run since the beginning of the year, with an appreciation of 44% YTD, a forward P/E of 7.3, and a dividend yield of 3.2%. It's been a great addition to the portfolio, but there have been several articles written in the last month that more than adequately cover the company's outlook. Instead of beating a dead horse, with this article I am interested in comparing Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate in an effort to identify which company is the better value.YTD Performance (Click to enlarge)(google.com/finance)Both companies have had a great six months with WDC having appreciated a bit more with a 50% return. Both companies are pledging and performing buybacks and dividend payments that match 100% of FCF for the year. This means that WDC is committing 2.4 billion and has a buyback yield of 16% and STX is committing 3.3 billion and has a buyback yield of 21%.(Click to enlarge)PriceSeagate's price to book value has appreciated significantly more over the last three years than Western Digital, which still remains below the average for the S+P 500. This would be more concerning if the increase in price was not supported by increasing earnings over the same time period, but both companies have maintained relatively low P/E ratios as prices have increased.(Click to enlarge)FCF and Fair ValueSeagate has maintained a higher FCF in the last two years and considering that the hard drive market is highly consolidated and pretty stable, both companies should be able to maintain this type of FCF for the near future. Using the analyst estimates for FY 2013 EPS of 5.29 and 8.33 for Seagate and Western Digital respectively and their current P/E ratios of 7 and 8.1, I calculate a fair value of 37.19 and 67.47.(Click to enlarge)ROIC versus DebtLooking at the companies balance sheets, Seagate has a weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC) of 7.6 versus Western Digital's WACC of 4.6. This indicates that Seagate has used more financing in order to grow the business in the past than Western digital has. That being said, Seagate's Return on Invested Capital of 37.2% is much greater than Western Digital's 18.9% indicating that is has maintained a higher return for the capital that is has invested even though it has had to take on some debt to finance it. Both companies have pretty decent balance sheets without a huge amount of debt and have debt/equity ratios of 0.75 for Seagate and 0.21 for Western Digital. Western Digital carries less long term debt while maintaining a reasonable ROIC. Seagate carries more long term debt, but has a higher ROIC and is working on retiring it's higher interest long term debt and has recently completed a tender offer for the 7.75% interest senior notes due in 2018.Concerns about Dwindling PC SalesThere are concerns about dwindling PC sales putting downward pressure on earnings for both of these companies. I think these worries are a bit overblown as demand for data storage continues to increase as more information is stored remotely and video and graphics become increasingly accessed across multiple platforms, not just by desktop PCs. This type of remote storage typically requires multiple backups of all stored data, usually 3 times over and this takes serious storage that can only be provided currently by large hard drives. Solid state drives will increasingly become a legitimate option for tablets and laptops as their capacity increases, but for mass storage of data, there currently is not a better solution than multiple large hard disk drives. In whatever way the industry shifts, it will be a significant hurdle for both companies and they have taken steps to address developing technologies through strategic acquisitions of La Cie and HGST.OverallBetween these two companies, Western Digital represents the better value at current price levels. Typically I would be drawn to Seagate's higher FCF and larger percentage of return of value to shareholders, but the price has appreciated so greatly that until it drops a bit or earnings support further appreciation I will not be purchasing at these levels. Seagate is maintaining a higher ROIC, but has taken on some debt in order to do so and is now working to eliminate it. As they further clean up their balance sheet, they should see more appreciation in the stock price and have more opportunities for strategic acquisitions. Western Digital has not had as significant an increase in P/BV over this time period, has a cleaner balance sheet even though ROIC is a bit lower and still looks to have the earnings to support some additional upside from here. Don't get me wrong, I think both companies will do well in the near future, but as a whole picture, Western Digital is a better value at current price levels.Disclosure: I am long STX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

1600302,46721,2013-08-02T16:21:18-04:00,,"After a three-month hiatus due to work commitments, I am back with a post on a business I've been looking at for quite some time (and more recently kicking myself over).In my previous post ""Thoughts on investment selection in a richly priced market"" I discussed the category of investments that I call ""Quality Value,"" which I defined as companies with similar characteristics to those that Warrant Buffett sought out in the post-Buffett Partnership phase of his career. To recap I believe that Quality-Value opportunities essentially combine the prudent, value-focused principles of Graham with the more forward-looking growth-oriented concepts espoused by Philip Fisher in Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits. Citing the example of Buffett's investment in Coca-Cola in 1998, in such opportunities, the value resides in the quality of the business, namely its consistency in terms of returns on capital and its favorable long-term prospects, which enables the Quality Value candidate company to grow (or compound) in value over time. As such, a Quality Value investment involves purchasing a business at a price that represents an attractive discount to a conservative estimate of its intrinsic value.With this definition in mind, I believe that Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC), a $15.5 billion market cap hard-disk drive (HDD) manufacturer is a potential Quality Value investment. It has consistently appeared on my personal Quality Value stock screen for quite some time. When I first started looking at it some 14 months ago, it was priced at $30 - $32 per share, or a market cap of about $8 billion.So I've been kicking myself in recent months on account of WDC's run-up in share price. The chart below perhaps best illustrates why I should be kicking myself (very hard) at the moment:June 2012 - July 2013 WDC share priceA 120% increase in share price for an S&P 500 constituent in the space of 14 months is pretty spectacular, even in the current, abnormal QE-juiced market. In hindsight, it was clearly an undervalued business and should have been an obvious buy. For reasons I will outline below, it was then, and remains now a strong business, in a sector with favorable business prospects.Before getting into the present situation with regard to WDC, context is useful here first: 14 months ago when it appeared on my Quality Value screen, its $30 - $32 share price implied a EV/FCF multiple of 4.0x - 4.5x, a net cash position and a 10-year track record of consistent double digit growth in revenues, net income, free cash flow and consistently high returns on unleveraged net tangible assets (10-year average to 2012 of 27.2%). Flipping the then multiple around it implied a FCF yield (on EV) of c. 21%! My take at that time was that the business was clearly undervalued, and erroneously priced for obsolescence, with a payback of 4 -5 years, with no residual or terminal value to the investment - for the (at the time) second largest HDD manufacturer in the world in a field of about 5-6 competitors. I really wish I had taken a position. Why didn't I buy? Personal circumstances meant a lack of any funds at the time to make a meaningful investment unfortunately. So I've missed out, right? Possibly not.Reading Whitney Tilson's presentation at the Value Investing Congress from last May, his point on the three most dangerous words in investing being ""I missed it"" particularly resonated with me. His exact point went as follows:This point has given me cause to re-evaluate WDC at its present price of approximately $66 per share, and ask that key question of whether it is still an exceptionally attractive investment, i.e. is it available for purchase with a margin of safety below a conservative estimate of intrinsic value?Without getting into a detailed financial analysis and valuation of the business (I will be posting a detailed investment case separately in due course), my conservative estimate of intrinsic value for WDC is a range of $85 - $105 per share, or in market cap terms (to consider the scale of the entire business rather than just per share values which can be open to manipulation), I believe it is a $20 billion - $25 billion company, versus its present $15.5 billion market cap. Some might say this is a broad range, but as Buffett has said about intrinsic value, when he buys a business he never knows exactly what its intrinsic value is, he just knows that its intrinsic value is well in excess of the price that he pays.Why is it undervalued?When I looked at WDC at 4.0x - 4.5x FCF some 14 months ago, it's price was depressed due to two primary factors in my view:Both of these factors were clear signs of a flawed assessment by investors as to the true value of WDC. The first factor, the Thailand floods, were a temporary adverse event, not a permanent one - the floods did not change the fundamental operations and prospects of WDC's business. Revenues, net income and free cash flow all rebounded after the floods, to the point that WDC (aided by the intelligent acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies or HGST, at a time when all data storage businesses were depressed) is now the dominant HDD manufacturer, having overtaken Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) in 2013.The second factor of Apple/tablet-mania was a classic case of WDC falling heavily into the out-of-favor bin, due to the post-PC narrative that prevailed as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) rose to prominence and tablets started to cannibalize PC sales. While there is no disputing that PC volumes have declined sharply as tablets have soared, this viewpoint of WDC as being in the wrong place and time in terms of both the device trend (tablets vs. PCs) and the technology trend (SSD vs. HDD) was misinformed and erroneous.In terms of the device trend, while PC units may be declining, more tablets mean more data creation, which has to be stored somewhere, i.e. the cloud. And where is cloud data stored? On large enterprise data storage platforms. Which WDC has exposure to.In terms of the technology trend, WDC also at that time had already started to invest in SSD (since 2009 in fact), and its enterprise storage business had started to grow (again bolstered by the HGST acquisition). Moreover, not all data needs to be stored on SSD - SSD offers higher performance, essential for rapid access, but this is not necessary for all data. Additionally, the cost of SSD is significantly greater than HDD storage solutions to the point that SSD for many consumers (business and individuals) simply does not make economic sense. And with the exponential growth in digital content, HDD remains a reliable and the cost-efficient solution for most storage needs.But investors actually did not actually understand any of these factors, and instead got caught up in the short-term noise in terms of both the temporary and longer-term factors that impact WDC's business and the data storage market more generally.But that was then and this is now - what is the use of reviewing what happened 14 months ago and investors' flawed judgment of the company and its prospects then? To learn from such mistakes and lost opportunities of course.Now back to the present situation. After a 120% rally, is WDC still undervalued? And if so why? And what is the catalyst for a re-rating of the business towards my estimate of intrinsic value for the company?I believe it remains undervalued, based on my conservative estimate of intrinsic value of between $20 billion - $25 billion as indicated above, which approximates 10x - 12x maintainable free cash flow. This is also supported by DCF analysis (to be made available in a subsequent post) using a 15% discount rate (Buffett's stated after-tax targeted return). Its present market cap of $15.5 billion values it at 7.4x maintainable free cash flow, and implies a 30% - 60% discount to intrinsic value.So if intrinsic value is $20 billion+, why is WDC still undervalued by the market?It comes down to investors still not understanding WDC's business and it prospects. Essentially, WDC suffers from a double-fear of obsolescence:These perceptions of both WDC and data storage technology are in fact overly simplistic, flawed, and constitute a real misunderstanding of both the company and the data storage market itself, for the following reasons:The above facts appear to have been lost within the clamor for all things smart/tablet-computing related in recent times however, leading to the erroneous judgment that the risk of obsolescence will be too great for WDC to overcome, hence its low valuation. All of this therefore creates an attractive investment opportunity.So with positive prospects, a strong business and intrinsic value of $85+ a share, what is the catalyst that will move the current share price to converge with intrinsic value?The catalyst for value-price convergence is a re-pricing of the company by investors in recognition of two key factors: (1) at the broader industry level, digital content will continue to grow at an exponential rate and which will require storage, with the additional realization that the PC will not die and that SSD is not necessarily the appropriate storage medium for all data, and (2) WDC has proven itself to be the best in class operator, with an excellent business that already offers multiple storage solutions that cater to all major areas of storage demand. At its present market cap, WDC offers a FCF yield of 14.1%. Once investors fully appreciate this, I believe WDC will be re-rated towards its intrinsic value range of $20 billion - $25 billion.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in WDC over the next 72 hours.

The independent manufacturers are entirely focused on manufacturing hard disk drives (HDDs) and the captive manufacturers like Hitachi (OTC:HICTF), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) are diversified companies with a hard drive division. The most important difference between the two is that captive competitors may sell hard drives at break even profit or even at a loss when it can bundle drives with other more profitable components, such as computer memory. This makes competition especially intense and sometimes irrational for independent manufacturers like Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ:WDC).Due to the similarities in market share and business focus, Seagate and Western Digital are chief rivals in the market. The two companies' offerings cover 97% and 90% of the market respectively and both companies produce desktop, mobile, enterprise, and consumer electronics products, and sell mainly to OEMs. Thus, many of the same market forces such as seasonal changes in sales and commoditization of PCs affect the two companies in the same ways.Solid State Devices (SSDs)The position of both these companies is threatened by the new rising competitor of hard drives: The flash memory-based solid state devices. Unlike hard drives, flash memory are solid state, so they contain no moving mechanical parts, use less power, are smaller and less likely to break. These advantages make flash memory very attractive for use in portable devices such as digital music players, cameras and laptops. SSDs still have a few limitations and problems but these limitations are being gradually overcome with technological advances. So although hard drives are still the dominant storage device, SSDs represents an impending threat to Seagate's and Western's business. Following the International Data Corporation (IDC), sales of SSDs will continue to rise every year until 2015.""2011 was a record year for the worldwide SSD market, with revenue more than doubling year over year due to strong SSD shipment growth in the enterprise and client segments,"" said Jeff Janukowicz, research director, Solid State Storage and Hard Disk Drive Components at IDC.The SSD industry revenue was of $5 billion in 2011, a more than double increase (105%) over the $2.4 billion of 2010.It will be very important to see how both data storage companies handle the upcoming of SSDs and integrate it into their business models. This article will focus on their approach on SSD so far.Seagate on SSDSeagate's position in the development of the SSD market up to now has been that of a follower of, investor in, and integrator of 3rd party SSD IP rather than an originator of leading SSD technologies. Seagate's highest rank to date in the top SSD companies list was #11 in Q1 2011.Seagate was a comparatively late entrant to the SSD market launching its first SSDs in December 2009. But Seagate was already corporately aware of SSDs - having launched an unsuccessful lawsuit aimed at STEC (now taken over by Western Digital Corp) the year before.But the main question is: Why didn't Seagate's dominance in the hard drive market translate into an early dominance in SSDs too?Well, Seagate misunderstood the potential size of the SSD market opportunity - and didn't think it was important enough compared to other business opportunities in hard drives.In January 2011, Seagate finally offered to the world a hard hitting rebuttal to the SSD-taking-over-the-world view in an economics focused paper which argued that the reason hard drives would remain the dominant storage technology was because - the company reassured us - it would cost far too much for the SSD market to invest enough resources into replacing hard drives.But this was not true, if users would start to see unbeatable business advantages from SSDs then the necessary investments would be made to support the larger SSD ecosystem.When Seagate did begin to realize that the SSD market wasn't going to go away - the SSD market had already grown too complicated for Seagate to understand what was going on and Seagate was in no position to entertain the idea of becoming a credible technology leader.It's likely that a root cause of Seagate's wrong footedness in SSDs in the 2003 to 2011 years was due to the company's management mistakenly viewing SSDs as just an expensive specialized form of hard drive. Seen from that perspective, hybrid drives and co-existence look like a better solution than they do from a pure SSD perspective.As Seagate didn't develop an adequate SSD IP set of its own - the company's first SSD products relied heavily on 3rd party IP from LSI (NYSE:LSI) and SandForce. However after LSI's acquisition of SandForce in January 2012 it soon became clear that LSI was perfectly capable of getting storage OEM customers such as EMC (EMC) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) on its own. It didn't need Seagate as a route into the SSD market.More recently - 2012 and 2013 - Seagate has therefore been pursuing the only realistic options left to latecomers in the SSD market - acquisition, licensing 3rd party IP and badge engineering.These recent steps are positive moves - either of which - if followed through - could improve Seagate's position within the SSD world.Only recently (May 2013) Seagate really ""impressed"" the SSD market by selling 'The Seagate 600 SSD' and 'The Seagate 600 SSD Pro'. The Seagate 600 SSD is the company's first mainstream 2.5-inch SSD. It has capacities up to 480GB and some versions are just 5mm thick, which means they are perfect for ultrabooks. Prices differ from $109.99 to $454.99 depending on the retailer, capacity and thickness you choose.Western Digital Corporation on SSDWDC on the other hand, also is a late entrant of the market and has recently decided to buy sTec Inc. (NASDAQ:STEC) for $340 million in cash as it also wants to expand its presence in the enterprise solid-state drive market. WDC's CEO said that solid state storage will continue to play an increasingly strategic role in the future of WDC and that this acquisition is again one more building block in his strategy to capitalize on the dramatic changes within the storage industry by investing in SSDs and other high-growth storage products.WDC started its SSD strategy in 2009 by the acquisition of SiliconSystems and really became significant with the 2011 acquisition of Hitachi GST, giving WDC market dominance in SAS SSDs. sTec brings WDC further enterprise SSD strength from its solid design capabilities and a high-performance product portfolio to boost WDC presence in the enterprise SSD market. The sTec acquisition will solidify WDC's position in SSDs while potentially giving Hitachi GST more control over its SSD architecture.Conclusion on SSDsSSD is a very competitive and complex set of markets. Even pure SSD companies [like Sandisk (SNDK), Micron (MU) and Fusion-io (FIO)] - which don't have other distractions - have a tough enough time understanding what's the right way to go with products and markets. Even though Seagate and Western Digital Corp.haven't done a lot of effort, they still haven't convinced me that they take SSDs as seriously as they should.Looking ahead at the challenges and opportunities posed by the SSD market for Seagate and Western Digital Corp.- I think that having to share management time and investment resources between the mutually different interests of solid state and magnetic drive product lines will lead to tensions and conflicts for resources in which the corporate ""compromise solutions"" aren't always going to be the same as the best of class solutions which the SSD market expects.The acquisition of sTec is good news for WDC's shareholders as this acquisition was a necessary and logical step in the right direction. For the first quarter of 2013, Seagate and Western stood respectively 15th and 22th on the ""Top SSD companies"" list. Which made very clear that Western was still lagging behind in the SSD market and had to do something to make the gap a little closer.Both companies should realize that in the modern era of SSDs - the only thing which can beat an SSD in the market - is another - better SSD. In that context - knowing how to design and build the best or cheapest hard drives - and having routes to market for hard drives is - frankly - irrelevant.General conclusionEven though Seagate is (currently) better positioned in the HDD and SSD market, has a higher dividend yield and is more profitable than Western Digital Corp., I'd buy nor Seagate nor Western Digital Corp. today. Both stocks have gone up too much on a year to date basis (WDC went +104% and STX +79%) and I feel that investors are too optimistic about the things these companies have done to prepare themselves for the SSD threat. Further acquisitions and efforts are needed to ensure their position in the market and to ensure long-term EPS growth for shareholders in the future. I have a strong feeling Western Digital Corp.will benefit a lot from its acquisition of sTec (which was standing third in the list of the ""Top SSD companies"") and I'm curious whether or not Seagate will react actively or passively. For now I just feel that it is too early to make an investment decision yet.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

[1] The move comes as the storage device maker catches up with its largest competitor Seagate  (NASDAQ:STX) to tap the expected surge in demand of SSHDs. Below we  discuss how the deal could benefit Western Digital going forward.We have a $64 price estimate for Western Digital, a slight premium to the current market price. Western Digital’s stock has risen over 30% this year. Demand For Hybrid Drives Are Expected To Surge SSDs have a few advantages over conventional HDDs as these drives  allow for faster  data  access  and are very thin compared to HDDs.  However, SSDs are currently much  more    expensive  per GB than HDDs,   leading to  slow adoption of SSDs as   primary memory  components in  drives. On  average,  SSDs   are at least twice as     expensive as   regular HDDs and  this  cost   differential is causing       price-conscious retail consumers to stick to devices with HDDs. In  addition, while developing and expanding cloud    infrastructures,  capacity generally matters more than speed for most enterprises. For the  next couple of years, SSD production costs are likely to remain high,  which will continue to act as a barrier to any huge pick up in SSD  demand. However, new hybrid drives (a combination of SSD and HDD) are  gaining traction as they have   performance  and  size  comparable to  SSD drives while  being relatively   cheaper.PC and notebook demand is expected to revive in the second half of 2013 [2]  as consumers who have been delaying  purchases due  to macroeconomic  conditions could start  spending more as the economy recovers. In  addition, the growth in cloud  computing  and network attached storage  is  boosting storage demand from  enterprises (read Western Digital’s Robust Growth And Outlook Support $64 Value).  These factors, coupled with an increase in SSHD options as more  manufacturers enter the market, will lead to substantially higher demand  for SSHDs in the next few years. Western Digital is trying to tap this  expected boom in demand as it prepares to launch the world’s thinnest  (2.5-inch) hybrid drives. [1]How SanDisk Can Help Western Digital?One of the primary components of SSD is NAND, a type of flash memory,  the supply of which can be rather sporadic. Electronics giants like  Apple and Samsung are the major buyers due to NAND’s use in smartphone  and tablets. Further, with various manufacturers announcing cuts in NAND  production, the market could witness supply constraints in the near  term. [3]  This is where Western Digital can gain from the deal with SanDisk as  overall NAND demand is expected to increase by 45% in 2013 mainly due to  rising sales of smartphones and tablets. [4]Initially, SSHDs are expected to target  mostly original equipment  manufacturers (OEMs). Should rapid demand from smartphones and tablet  sales outpace NAND supply, this could interrupt the production of SSHDs.  Restarting idle NAND supply or adding additional capacity takes time  and the supply would likely come into the market with a lag. This in  turn could hurt OEMs’ production of PCs and notebooks.Therefore, OEMs  would  likely prefer to buy SSHDs from a  manufacturer that is relatively insulated from potential supply issues.  SanDisk has a joint venture with Toshiba for NAND production getting  49%  of the total production. Therefore, by tying up with SanDisk,  Western Digital will gain access to a steady NAND supply. This could  help Western Digital make more progress in the hybrid drive market  despite Seagate’s first mover advantage.Disclosure: No positions."

However, I believe the rally represents a selling opportunity for investors currently long both names and a possible short opportunity for more aggressive investors.STX data by YChartsValuation Not The Main ProblemDespite the massive rally in share price, currently, both STX and WDC trade at single digit PE ratios. In the past, both stocks have traded at higher multiples. However, I believe both STX and WDC are value traps.STX Forward PE Ratio data by YChartsOver the years, due to cheap valuation, both STX and WDC have been talked about as possible private equity buyout targets. Perhaps, when both STX and WDC were trading below 5 times forward earnings, as recently as early 2013, a deal made sense. However, with both STX and WDC trading closer to 10 times forward earnings I believe a buyout is less likely.Chanos Short ThesisNoted investor Jim Chanos has recently turned bearish on the entire industry including STX and WDC in particular. In short, here is the Chanos thesis:As I have previously noted, Jim Chanos is someone worth listening to. That is not to say that I think investors should follow Chanos into every trade. For example, I do not agree with Chanos's view on Dell. However, I do agree with what he is saying about STX and WDC.Insider SellingDespite trading at single digit PE ratios, insiders have been aggressively selling both STX and WDC into the rally. Without question, this is a negative. To me, these large sales suggest that insiders do not believe the future is good for STX and WDC as they are selling at low valuations. In addition to the large number and size of stocks sales in both STX and WDC over the past six months there have been no insider purchases of stock.Einhorn Reduces STX StakeNoted hedge fund investor David Einhorn bought STX shares in 2011 around $16 per share. However, more recently, Einhorn has started selling shares. As I said before, investors should never solely make decisions based on what other ""famous"" investors are doing. That being said, Einhorn's selling should be viewed as a negative.Conclusion & Action PlanFor the reasons discussed above, I am bearish on both STX and WDC. There are a variety of ways for investors to express this thesis:Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in STX over the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1465751,36021,2013-05-28T20:23:27-04:00,,"Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and SanDisk (SNDK) are two US based manufacturers of semiconductor memory devices.Micron is a broad line manufacturer of DRAM, NAND flash, and NOR flash memory, while SanDisk make only NAND flash memory through a joint venture with Toshiba of Japan.Both companies produce high level memory system solutions, both make SSDs (Solid State Drives), both make camera and cellphone memory micro cards and both make the ubiquitous UBS ""thumb"" drives. Micron also uses some of their DRAM capacity to make DRAM modules used in PCs and other computing equipment.SanDisk's primary business is NAND based solution products and only sells NAND at the component level when they have extra parts that can't be sold in finished products. The company is committed to take about 35% of the output of the Toshiba fabs; Toshiba markets the 65% balance of the output primarily as components.Micron is the mirror image of the above model; Micron sells primarily component level memory chips, but the company is becoming a large and growing factor in SSDs and the other memory end products.Micron is involved in a joint venture with Intel that had spawned a 100,000 wafer start per month, state of the art NAND manufacturing facility located in Singapore. Micron and Intel have co-operated in the development of the Hybrid Memory Cube that was named the EE Times memory product of the year.The Micron/Intel joint venture began as a NAND only arrangement and was modified in February of 2012 to include the development of emerging memory technology.In recent earnings presentations, both companies have advised the investing community that while they expect ""tight"" supply of NAND memory going forward, neither company is planning any new manufacturing capacity. The reason cited by both companies is, ""3D NAND is close enough on the horizon that we don't want to spend the money on 2D equipment and have to re-spend on 3D equipment. Neither company gave any specifics on when either of them could be in production with 3D NAND. I find this position strange and unprecedented in the semiconductor industry for reasons I will cover later.SanDisk makes only NAND, is selling all they can and is planning no capacity additions. Current sales are about $5.2 billion per year.Micron makes a variety of memory which allows them to alter their DRAM/NAND capacity profile. The company is in the final stages of acquiring Elpida Memories of Japan at a fraction of the replacement cost. According to Mark Adams, President of Micron, the combined companies will have sales of $16 billion (12 min point). Elpida provides Micron an important missing link in the memory business; mobile DRAM used in smartphones. Actually it is a twofer since now Elpida can get the NAND chips from Micron that go into the multi-chip packages in all those smartphones. SanDisk/Toshiba have to buy mobile DRAM on the open market for inclusion in MCPs.The point of all of this is that we have two quite comparable companies selling identical products into the same market. Therefore, it would seem reasonable that the two companies should have a comparable value in terms of price to sales ratio.The problem with this view is that we have a stable SanDisk (no path to growth, but stable.) On the other hand we have a pre-Elpida Micron and a post-Elpida Micron to consider.Here's how that looks:I am making some assumptions about the Post-Elpida Micron, such as the company, with the recent 100% price increase in DRAM prices and the rumored profitability turn-around of Elpida should earn similar margins to SanDisk. After the closing of the Elpida deal, both companies should grow at about the same rate, maybe 10% per year. My handy-dandy valuation formula would value both companies at about 2.4 time's sales. SanDisk at about $52/share and Post-Elpida Micron at about $38.So, the conclusion is that SanDisk will do a little downward price adjustment and Post-Elpida Micron will more than triple. I think I know what the right thing to do is.Now, about that no-new-capacity-for-NAND thing. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is releasing the new, very power efficient Haswell CPU family at Computex during the week of June 3, 2013. The Haswell is all about light, thin, and long battery life. Most people buying a Haswell based PC will want to use a Solid State Drive instead of a power hog, slow, heavy HDD. SSDs are made from NAND flash memory. In an unimaginably bad PC market, Intel will still sell 300 million mostly Haswell chips in the next twelve month period. If only one third of those chips sold required SSDs, the industry would have to thumb up about 1.2 billion 128Gb NAND chips. That number converts to about 4.8 million NAND wafers. That is about four times the output of the huge NAND fab built in Singapore by Micron and Intel. Everything I read says the NAND memory supply/demand is in approximate balance today.So, the big, huge, giant question is, ""Where is all the NAND going to come from?""This is big problem and someone isn't showing us all their cards, but however this is solved, Post-Elpida Micron, as the world's largest merchant market supplier of memory, and SanDisk/Toshiba will be right in the middle of it. My personal favorite of the two, by a wide margin, is Micron.Disclosure: I am long MU, INTC. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1541632,25120,2013-07-10T05:58:59-04:00,,"Shareholders in SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) have seen very healthy returns so far in 2013. Last week, SanDisk announced the strategic acquisition of SMART Storage Systems, in an attempt to fortify its position in the enterprise market. After the strong share price performance so far in 2013, shares offer little appeal at the moment, despite the modest valuation and the expected operational improvements for the year. The recent strong momentum in average selling prices is inflating the current prospects,in my opinion.The DealSanDisk announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire SMART Storage Systems. The company will pay $307 million in cash and equity-based incentive awards for the developer of enterprise solid state drives (SSDs).The leader in flash memory storage solutions will buy the company from investment funds tied to Silver Lake. The 250 employees of SMART will join SanDisk following completion of the deal. SMART's SATA and SAS enterprise SSD offerings, including its Guardian Technology solutions, extend the endurance of NAND flash memory while improving reliability.SMART Storage Systems generated revenues of $25 million over its past quarter which ended in May, 2013. While the company is rapidly growing, the transaction will be slightly dilutive to SanDisk's non-GAAP earnings per share in the second half of 2013. Shareholders should expect some accretion to occur to 2014's earnings.A simple extrapolation of the revenues being generated over the past quarter shows that SMART Storage Systems could surpass the $100 million revenue mark for the full year. This values the company at roughly 3 times annual revenues. The deal has already been approved by the board of directors of both companies and is expected to close as early as August of this year.ValuationSanDisk ended its first quarter of 2013 with $3.31 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments. The company furthermore holds $2.88 billion in long-term marketable securities. SanDisk holds $1.72 billion in convertible debt, for a solid net cash position of around $4.5 billion.Last year, SanDisk generated annual revenues of $5.05 billion, down 10.8% on the year before. Net income more than halved to $417.4 million. The company did manage to grow first quarter revenues for 2013, which rose by 11.2% to $1.34 billion. Trading around $60 per share, the market values SanDisk at $14.7 billion. Excluding the solid net cash position of the firm, operating assets are valued just above the $10 billion mark. This values the company at roughly 2 times annual revenues and 24-25 times last year's earnings. Despite the solid cash position, SanDisk does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveDespite the struggles over the past year, shares of SanDisk trade at multi-year highs. Shares rose from merely $20 in 2004 to peak in their seventies by the start of 2006. Shares fell hard during the financial crisis, to lows of $5 in 2008. Shares gradually recovered to levels around $60 at the moment.Shares have already risen by almost 40% so far in 2013. This move is on the back of the operational improvements in recent quarters, driven by a recovery in average selling prices. First quarter average selling prices fell 18% on the year, but were actually up 2% on the quarter before. This marked the first time in the company's history that average selling prices have risen two quarters in a row.Between 2009 and 2012, SanDisk managed to increase its annual revenues by more than 40% to $5.05 billion, despite a weaker full year of 2012. Net income stagnated around the $417 million mark.Investment ThesisIt is not just SanDisk which is looking for bargains in the SSD field. Back in June, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) announced the acquisition of troubled STEC (NASDAQ:STEC). Similar to the deal which Western Digital made, the acquisition of SMART is just a drop in the bucket for SanDisk, adding merely 2% in annual revenues. The price tag, at roughly 3 times annual revenues, represents a significant premium compared to SanDisk's own valuation at 2 times annual revenues, based on the valuation of its operating assets. Yet the deal is of a highly strategic nature in an attempt to improve its product offerings across the entire company, in which the technology of SMART can be crucial.The deal will furthermore aid SanDisk to reduce its reliance on consumer sales, shifting towards the enterprise market. While the strong growth in smartphones will continue to drive growth in the medium-term future, long-term threats are emerging on the back of cloud offerings which make local storage memory less relevant. A whole range of apps based on cloud-based offerings allow smartphone users to make more pictures, movies and store more music without necessarily increasing the memory of their mobile device.For now, SanDisk is on track to generate annual revenues of $5.60-$5.75 billion for the full year of 2013, marking another record year. As earnings could approach the $1 billion mark, operating assets are valued around 1.8 times annual revenues and 10 times earnings.Despite the record results, the strong cash balances, and the modest valuation, I remain on the sidelines. The strong momentum, driven by recent strength in average selling prices, have propelled shares higher this year. This leaves little room to the upside in the immediate term, in my opinion.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1477391,23479,2013-06-03T14:23:39-04:00,,"SanDisk (SNDK) is one of the leading designers and manufacturers of NAND flash storage solutions. NAND products are re-writeable, non-volatile semiconductor memory devices that retain content even when the power is turned off. NAND is ideal for mass-storage devices due to its fast erase and write times, high density, and low cost per bit relative to other solid-state memory. SanDisk's flash memory cards segment, which primarily sells flash storage for smartphones and feature phones, is the company's biggest division and makes up approximately 25% of its value.We think that much of SanDisk's unit sales growth over the next few years will come from the robust sales growth of smartphones, which is a key driver within the flash memory card division. However, we forecast the average selling price for NAND flash per gto continue declining, albeit at a slower pace, for the rest of our forecast period. Below we take a look at key trends affecting this division.Rapid Growth in Smartphones Sales to Drive NAND DemandSince the launch of the iPhone in 2007 followed by the introduction of Android, the smartphone market has seen rapid growth. In addition to communication, smartphones have enabled people to perform more tasks comfortably anytime, anywhere. With a huge number of apps being designed for every small task imaginable, smartphones have truly changed the way of life. The number of smartphones sold globally increased from 120 million in 2007 to nearly 660 million in 2012, witnessing 40% yearly growth in units sold. The share of smartphones in the global mobile market (around 1.8 billion devices each year) has increased to 40% in 2012 from sub-10% in 2007.The trend is expected to continue going forward with demand coming from low penetration in emerging markets including China, Brazil, and India. Worldwide smartphone sales are projected to cross 900 million units this year to surpass feature-phone sales. By the end of 2017, over 1.5 billion smartphones are expected to be shipped worldwide, or about two-thirds of the global mobile market. The rapid rise in global shipments for smartphones will be the key growth driver in the flash storage industry.We are witnessing strong NAND content growth in smartphones. As the quality of media content improves with higher resolution pictures and high definition videos, the demand for more local storage capacity will grow. Furthermore, the growing use of applications (especially for productivity) in smartphones is increasing the need for greater local storage on devices. We therefore expect the average capacity of flash memory in smartphones to grow by almost 20%-25%, a bit slower than the historical growth. This is due to the growing threat from cloud storage services like iCloud, Dropbox, etc., that make local memory storage more or less irrelevant for accessing data.Average Selling Prices to DeclineReacting to the rapid rise in sales of smartphones and tablets coupled with the anticipated shift toward ultrabooks and SSDs, many chip manufactures ramped up their production capacities. However, the growth in ultrabooks and SSDs did not meet initial expectations, which led to a supply glut in the NAND memory market. The excess supply coupled with the current macroeconomic headwinds further drove down NAND prices that were continuously declining on account of intense competition among chipmakers. We estimate that average selling prices per gigabyte for flash memory declined from around $3 in 2008 to around $0.50 in 2012.As technology improvements lower costs, we expect this trend to continue and forecast ASPs to decline to around $0.05 per GB by 2019. The three-bits-per-cell (or X3) technology results in lower costs and increases capacity of memory chips by allowing higher density of data to be stored on the same amount of silicon. On its investor day meet held earlier this month, SanDisk announced its next-generation process technology which is expected to further reduce costs.However, the pace of price declines should be slower than that witnessed over the last couple of years. The demand/supply gap is closing with many suppliers cutting their capacities. Toshiba Corp., Japan's leading chipmaker and a SanDisk partner, has cut its production of flash memory chips by as high as 30% on account of industry oversupply. The company has a share of close to 30% of the global NAND flash market. Additionally, the current scenario in the memory industry has forced many small players to shut down, leading to the much-needed market consolidation. This has taken some excess capacity off the market.Disclosure: No positions."

After all, the stock is up 49% year to date and 112% over the past 12 months. Such dramatic gains might lead some to believe that the stock has run out of steam.Such thinking, however, ignores the fundamentals of the company. WDC is more profitable than ever and remains significantly undervalued.High ProfitabilityAs I wrote last year, cloud computing is a good thing for WDC as it will increase the overall demand for storage. I highlight WDC because of its top quintile return on invested capital (ROIC) of 40% and the intelligent capital allocation capabilities exhibited by its management team to achieve that high an ROIC. In an industry with high growth potential, capital allocation is critical to creating shareholder value.It is hard to find a better example of intelligent capital allocation than WDC's acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST) in 2012. I am often critical of ""earnings accretive"" acquisitions because they show misleading earnings growth, but WDC created real value with HGST.Many companies are guilty of overpaying for cash flows, shelling out billions of dollars for relatively small profits and reducing ROIC. WDC, on the other hand, increased its ROIC from 22% in fiscal year 2011 to 40% in 2012. WDC more than doubled its after-tax profit (NOPAT) while increasing average invested capital by less than 50%. Even better, this highly profitable acquisition was completed without wrecking the balance sheet, as WDC still has more excess cash than debt.High ROIC acquisitions are especially shareholder-friendly when they result in new cutting-edge products. WDC just unveiled and shipped the thinnest (7mm) 1 terabyte hard drive ever.Attractive ValuationEven with the stock trading near its all-time high, WDC remains remarkably cheap. The stock has a price-to-economic-book-value ratio of 0.6, implying that the market expects WDC's NOPAT to permanently decline by 40%. The no-growth value of this business is over $100/share.Figure 1: Stock Price Looking Up at No-Growth ValueSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Back in December I wrote that WDC is highly undervalued at anything below $70/share, and I'm sticking by that statement. Investors that missed WDC's 50% gain this year need not beat themselves up. At ~$63.80/share, WDC has plenty of room to keep going up.Institutional investors aren't recognizing the value in WDC, as there are no ETFs or mutual funds with sufficient liquidity that allocate significantly to WDC and earn an Attractive or better rating. No wonder so many active managers underperform.The only way to get this stock is to buy it directly -- and you don't have to pay any management fees.Sam McBride contributed to this article.Disclosure: I am long WDC.

1408811,32001,2013-05-07T11:20:20-04:00,,"SanDisk (SNDK) holds an Investor Day tomorrow, Wednesday, May 8th, so the company could be out with a press release as soon as this evening or perhaps tomorrow. With SNDK reporting Q1 '13 earnings recently, there is likely to be very little new incremental news, although the stock is down after earnings from a high of $58.92 on April 11th, trading as low as $51.18 on May 1, which probably defines its trading range for now.SanDisk beat on Q1 '13 revenues by 3%, beat on Q1 '13 EPS by 6% and guided higher for the 2nd quarter, only to see the stock get crushed. I think the selling after earnings was more a function of the monster 25% run the stock had in the first quarter, as it laps very weak comparisons for 2012, through the 2nd quarter.SanDisk is a tough stock to own: we've been caught a number of times the last few years holding for too long, and getting caught in a downside draft as supply swelled and pricing tanked, crushing earnings, as was the case for the first 6 months of 2012.In the April conference call, SNDK management noted that it thought neither Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) or Micron (NASDAQ:MU) would add to capacity in 2013, which is definitely a positive since it will sustain the current supply / demand and pricing strength being seen in the sector.My question as an investor / portfolio manager is, ""what are peak earnings for SanDisk ?"" given the favorable supply / demand and pricing environment, and how long can it continue? For 2013, current consensus is looking for $4.10 per share, which is still less than the $4.65 EPS from 2011 (which at that time was a high print), but is 25% higher than the $3.30 2013 consensus estimate from one year ago.SSD's are a new market for SNDK and will help drive additional revenue growth as SNDK continues to gain share in SSD's, but my experience with the stock / company since the late 1990's is that these new markets get increasingly commoditized quickly, and SNDK might not be able to get to the same peak gross margins it did in September, 2010, with a 52% gross margin and a 37% operating margin.Our spreadsheet for SNDK goes all the way back to the late 1990's and most times SNDK's gross margin peaked between 48% - 50% and operating margin peaked at 34% - 35%. Since the late 1990's, over 58 quarters, the gross margin has averaged 33% over the 58 quarters.Using the 2015 current consensus revenue estimate of $7 billion(approximately), and a net profit margin of 15%, peak earnings could get to $7 per share. With just a 12% profit margin, peak earnings are $3.50, with one problem being that ""shares outstanding"" continue to grow, rather than shrink, as the capex requirement of a semiconductor, as capex as a % of revenues have gyrated between 2% and 8% the last 4 years, thus SNDK management can't (or won't) repurchase stock, and slowly seems to be diluting shareholders.This is a tough business model: heavy capex requirements, supply that comes on quickly, commoditized end markets and steep operating leverage, shares outstanding which are growing slowly, all seems to result in gradually lower margins making for nervous investors, me included. SanDisk continues to lap very easy comp's through the 2nd quarter, 2013, and the weak yen is really helping gross margin.Our internal valuation model puts an intrinsic value on SNDK of $66 per share currently. Morningstar doesn't rate the shares currently. We remain a nervous long for now, as the 2nd quarter earnings, revenue growth and margins will tell us much. I don't anticipate holding the shares much beyond 2013, but that can change quickly, and it could change either way. Currently, I do think the SanDisk Investor Day will be a net positive with a weaker yen, better pricing, and SSD's still a positive end-market.Disclosure: I am long SNDK, MU.

1441241,45851,2013-05-16T15:11:41-04:00,,"There's no doubt that we now live in the post-personal computer era. Gone are the days when consumer computing technology was dominated by desktop computers. Today, anyone armed with a smartphone or tablet - and soon, wearable computers - has the capacity to create the sort of rich media that once necessitated a much larger, not to mention more expensive, device. Moreover, such devices finally deliver on a promise made by PCs in the 80s - the ability to connect with other users in a timely, effortless and seamless fashion.It is therefore not surprising that PC sales were surpassed by smartphone sales in 2011 while tablets are expected to achieve the same distinction some time in 2013.One of the less highlighted - but equally important - developments over the past decade has been the miniaturization of storage: devices no larger than a nail now have the capacity to carry all the information contained in encyclopedias, all the music in someone's collection or personal photo archive. Absent this development, the ability of device makers such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to deliver the kind of attractively slim, portable device that has enabled the post-PC era to take off would have been severely limited - and perhaps we would still be living in the PC era.Which is why it's not surprising that the makers of such devices have seen their stocks rocket in the year thus far: Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and its competitors Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and SanDisk (SNDK) have each seen their stocks rise by over 30%, as the chart below illustrates. Such returns are more than double that of the S&P 500 in the same time frame.Chart: Western Digital vs. Peers & The S&P 500Source: YChartsAs we mentioned in our earlier article on Seagate, there has been a subtle shift in the post-PC era: smartphones and tablets, not being quite like PCs, are actually shipping with less on-device storage these days. Cloud services take advantage of fast mobile broadband to stream media to portable devices, mitigating users' need to carry their digital libraries with them. At the same time, the popularity and ubiquity of such services allows device makers to continue to shift devices without being hampered by the design and cost considerations related to providing ample portable storage. It also makes such devices easier to pitch to carriers: a greater reliance on mobile data means more revenue per subscriber, particularly since carriers have shifted away from unlimited data plans.Rather than signaling the end of the party for storage makers, this only shifts the demand for storage away from consumers to the many enterprises providing cloud services: in short, the punchbowl is still there, there are just different sippers.In our view, Western Digital, which has been taking advantage of the new paradigm, has the upper hand and investors would do well to have this stock in their portfolios. Here's why:Better Earnings ProspectsWestern Digital has beaten expectations by an average of 18% in each of the past four quarters. The same cannot be said for Seagate, its closest competitor, which missed estimates in two of its past four quarters. At the same time, while both Seagate and Western Digital are coming from periods of fast earnings growth (both having averaged over 25% EPS growth over the past five years), Western Digital is actually expected to continue growing its earnings - albeit at a far slower rate - whereas Seagate is expected to see its earnings contract over the next five years.This is already evident in their most recent quarters: Western Digital grew its revenues by 24%, whereas Seagate's contracted by nearly the same magnitude. More importantly, Western Digital's revenue is expected to surpass Seagate's by nearly $1 billion in their fiscal years ending June 2013 - and that gap is forecast to persist the following year when both companies are anticipated to see overall revenue contraction.Regardless, both companies' earnings growth rates will trail that of their industry peer group over the next five years, but that should be unsurprising given their industry-leading positions and the contraction of storage shipments due to longer PC refresh cycles (ironically aided and abetted by smartphones and tablets) and the ongoing realignment of the storage market. Still, Western Digital looks likely to end up on top: it is expected to have as much as 45% market share in 2013, 2 percentage points greater than Seagate's.Moreover, Western Digital has stepped up its capital spending in the past five years; it can reasonably anticipate a payoff for these investments down the line, even if it has to pay for these investments with up-front depreciation costs.Solid Valuation And FundamentalsWestern Digital is currently trading at 7.3x trailing earnings - less than half the 18.2x earnings of its industry peers. That's to be expected given the anticipated slowdown in its earnings momentum but it is a bit higher than Seagate's 6.4x earnings. We argue that a bit of a premium is warranted considering Western Digital's industry-leading position and also because, on a forward basis, Western Digital gets cheaper. Based on their five-year forward EPS growth projections, everything else being equal, Western Digital will be trading at just 6.5x whereas Seagate will be at 7.8x - a complete reversal of the current paradigm.It would also give Western Digital a 23% valuation discount to its Industry's five-year forward earnings ratio of 8.4x. In short, the industry leader is cheap even on a forward earnings basis.Other valuation metrics also provide the same conclusion. For instance, on a price-to-sales basis, Western Digital is trading at less than a year's revenues - 0.84x - compared to its industry's 1.6x. Seagate is actually priced a little bit higher at 0.94x revenues. Meanwhile, both Western Digital's price-to-book value and price-to-free cash flow multiples are at least 27% lower than its industry peers.All this and Western Digital is actually relatively generous to its investors, paying a dividend yield of 1.7%, which is more than the 0.8% yield of its industry peer group, though quite a bit lower than the 3.8% yield of Seagate.That being said, there's a good reason Western Digital isn't as generous to investors: it's been reinvesting its cash into its operations. As mentioned, Western Digital has increased its capital spending significantly: its five-year capital spending growth rate is at 38.5%, nearly triple its industry's level and far greater than Seagate's, which has not been increasing its capital spending during the same period.What this means is that investors have more to look forward to from Western Digital: its investments are likely to begin paying off in the next five years, which suggests that there could be an upside against forward estimates. Indeed, Western Digital's management has shown that it can be very effective: in the past year, its net income margin has been at 12.2%, compared with break-even for the storage industry as a whole (as well as the S&P 500). More pertinently, over the past five years, Western Digital's return on investment has been a stellar 18.7%, which is more than double its industry's measure and 56% better than Seagate's.ConclusionThere is no doubt that storage is a critical component of the Post-PC era and, given Western Digital's continued excellence in the field, it can likewise serve as a critical component of investors' portfolios. Currently, Western Digital rests above its one-year consensus price target of $57.79 but we believe that this is not cause for alarm and that, in the event of a summer swoon, investors would do well to purchase the stock on dips of 5 to 15% in anticipation of seeing the stock somewhere between $65 and $70 by year's end.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in WDC over the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: Black Coral Research, Inc. is a team of writers who provide unique perspective to help inspire investors.

1429971,43401,2013-05-13T11:46:19-04:00,,"All data and information in this article is either from the companies' SEC filings or S&P stock reports.I recently funded some retirement accounts and have since been looking for an investment to park the cash in. Unfortunately, I haven't had much luck finding something that I feel confident will do well at current prices. As Warren Buffett says, an investment opportunity should ""hit you over the head"" and I haven't gotten that feeling lately. So, it was exciting when my screener brought up Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate Technology PCL (NASDAQ:STX). Both companies are leaders in the internal and external electronic storage device industry. Chances are, if you've ever needed some extra storage space for your computer files, music or photos, you've come across them in your search for a good, durable hard drive. Yet, the valuation on these stocks seems shockingly low. WDC is trading at a P/E of ~7, while its P/B is 1.66 and STX, Western Digital's biggest competitor, which is trading at a P/E of ~ 5.5 and a P/B of 5.2. The question is, why are both companies trading at such low multiples and will either one be a good investment for the long-term.Quick ComparisonThe following is a quick comparison of WDC's and STX's pertinent information and ratios. FY 2011 both experienced flooding in their Thailand facilities, which is why they both had weak revenue and earnings in that year.When looking at the financial statements for STX and WDC, one can quickly see a big difference. (Per share data is calculated based on current amount of shares outstanding.)AcquisitionsIn the last few years both WDC and STX had major acquisitions:Future & UncertaintiesWestern Digital and Seagate's main business product are hard drive disks (HDD), which are commonly found in computers, laptops, servers and other traditional computing devices. However, such drives aren't found in tablets, smartphones or other handheld devices, which use solid state drives (SSD).SSDs are smaller, use less power and are less prone to break if dropped. However, they are more expensive to manufacture, although the costs are coming down quickly. On the other hand, HDDs are cheaper to manufacture and, although they use more power and are more prone to breaking due to their moving mechanical parts, they are the storage of choice for cloud computing and high data uses. (See Wikipedia)Both Seagate and WDC feel that hard drive disks are still the best place for their enterprises to be at this time. However, with consumers moving to mobile, WD and Seagate may be caught flat-footed. This is why analysts are giving these companies a ""sell"" rating. They see the need for SSDs growing while the need for HDDs falls. This will cause slower growth and lower profits for both Seagate and WD. It should be noted that both companies have made acquisitions that put them into the SSD market, however, it still remains a relatively small part of both companies.ValuationWhen valuing a company, the hardest part is what Warren Buffett refers to as the ""what-will-they-do-with-the-money"" factor. This is to say that we, as (small) investors, have no say in what management will do with assets and cash they currently have or will earn as time goes by. Yet, it is this factor that is most important when valuing a company. Therefore, we must try to come to a figure that represents the true value of the shares based on what the future holds.It's clear from their financial statements that, Seagate has, in the past, enjoyed better earnings power compared to Western Digital. In this respect, their leverage has served them well. However, as FY 2009 shows, this can be to their detriment in bad times - STX reported a $3 billion dollar loss on $9.8 billion in revenue. WD, on the other hand, reported profits of $454 million on $7.45 billion in revenue in the same year.If analysts are correct on expectations of the future, STX will most likely have a harder time due to its higher leverage. However, I wouldn't be too concerned, in FY 2012 operating earnings were 12.90x interest. Even according to analysts' dire expectations of the future STX should make enough to cover the interest charge with a wide margin.It's doubtful that WDC and STX will have as bad a future as S&P analysts suggest. In fact the ""fair value"" given to WDC by S&P analysts is $69, 18% higher than its current price, even as they give a ""sell"" rating on the stock. This is because they see the stock declining over the next 12 months. However, over the long-term they feel that the stock is worth more than it's currently selling atIt should also be noted that during a WDC conference on Wednesday April 24, 2013, management mentioned:Although I don't know what percentage of STX's revenue came from non-PC related business, I would not be surprised if it was in line with WDC's. However, it is clear that both companies are taking steps to move away from PCs.For the aforementioned reasons, I think it's reasonable to value these companies at an enterprise value of 10 times EBIT. When calculating this figure, it is preferable to use average earnings of, say, the last 5 years. This includes the recession years, which should give us an idea of how to value these shares in an economic downturn, especially STX. We will also base values on EV, which means that 10 times EBIT will equal a hypothetical EV that we would be willing to pay. Based on this EV, we will be able to calculate backwards to what we think the equity of the company is worth. However, since both companies have made major acquisitions that greatly impact their businesses, an average of the last 5 years may not be a great indicator of what the future earnings power of either company may be. Therefore, we will also take FY 2012's earnings and use a multiple of 8. We can then use the average of these two valuations to come to a conclusion about what we think the shares are worth.To do this calculation we will take the hypothetical EV (EBIT x 10) and add back in the excess cash and deduct the value of the companies' debt and be left with an amount that we feel is what the equity is worth. We then divide this by the amount of shares currently outstanding, arriving at the price per share that we would be willing to pay.While the above calculation tells us what the shares of each company are worth at this time, Benjamin Graham warns us that we must always add in a ""margin-of-safety."" As such, investors should only be willing to buy these stocks at prices lower than the amount we calculated above.Therefore, although both stocks are currently priced with low P/E ratios, investors should realize that they are not getting a bargain or as deep a discount as they may think. Although I do think that these stocks will do well over the long-term, they do not seem priced low enough for an investor that is looking for value.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1385101,23479,2013-04-30T13:49:38-04:00,,"Western Digital  (NASDAQ:WDC) announced its Q3 FY 2013 earnings on April 24. It ended  the  quarter on a strong note and beat market expectations as revenues  grew by over 25% on a year-over-year (y-o-y) basis to $3.8 billion. [1]  Growing overall storage demand continued to drive the revenue growth.  The storage company saw volume increase in both PC and non-PC businesses  on a y-o-y basis, as it shipped a total of 60.2 million hard  drives, a  huge jump  over the 44.2 million it shipped in the same period a  year  ago. Revenues also got a boost from a 35% y-o-y increase in average  capacity per drive, to 810 gigabytes (GB). [2]  A less than expected decline in average   selling prices also lent  support. Average selling price (NYSE:ASP) per hard drive was $61 in the  quarter, down from $68 a  year ago, but  close to last quarter’s ASP of  $62.While gross margin declined to nearly 28% from around 31% a year ago,  the positive thing was that it was higher than the last quarter despite  a slight decline in average selling price. This was due to better mix  of products and cost improvements. Western Digital generated over $500  million in free cash flow even as it spent nearly $400 million and $190  million towards R&D and capital expenditures, respectively. This  resulted into an increase in its net cash (after subtracting debt from  available cash), which surpassed the $2 billion mark. The storage  company expects Q4 FY 2013 revenues in the range of $3.55 billion to  $3.65  billion, due to a flat-to-slightly down total available market,  coupled with a seasonal change in the business mix.After strong results, Western Digital’s stock touched new highs of $58 before retreating. We have updated our price estimate of Western Digital to $64, to reflect earnings.  Storage Requirement Soaring With Growing High Definition Digital Content, Cloud Computing And Remote Storage ServicesThe   increasing demand for high  definition    (HD) content for  media  consumption and rich   formats such  as HD DVD and Blu-Ray  continue to  drive demand for high  capacity  disk    drive solutions in  the end-user  market. More consumers  are  turning  to external drives  to increase  their     existing storage  capacities to  create and share  HD content. While PC sales are declining due to consumer softness in  mature markets    (the U.S. and Western Europe), slowing demand from  emerging markets and    IT spending cuts amidst weak macroeconomic  environment, the growing demand from  increasing tablet and smartphones  is more than offsetting the decline. Tablet and  smartphone users also  consume more  digital content like  online video   streaming, email and   music, and are driving storage  requirements. They are increasingly  becoming dependent on network  attached     storage while tablets with  USB ports are seeing greater  adoption of   external  drives for   additional  storage capacity.Remote storage is becoming a standard for most   enterprises and has   even gained traction with retail customers for services like iCloud,   Dropbox, Skydrive and Google Drive. More   businesses  are deploying  cloud computing environments in an effort to   pool  resources    and  cut costs. Owing to aforementioned factors, the revenue contribution of  Western Digital’s non-PC related  business is expected to grow    from  35% FY 2008 to more   than   50% in FY 2013.Western Digital Well Placed To Tap The Market In its Enterprise business, we believe Western Digital is placed to  tap the growing storage demand. Currently, hard disk drives (HDD) offer a   more cost-efficient  alternative to solid state drives (SSD), making  them a more suitable     option for developing and expanding cloud   infrastructures, as capacity     matters more than speed. Western   Digital is a leader in the  enterprise HDD space and already has several      high performance  products to offer. The storage company is  also  developing  new  helium filled drives,       which once widely launched, are expected to provide it a   significant     advantage over competitors. These drives consume  up      to 23% less power while allowing for a nearly 40% jump in  capacity.However, in the long run, SSD production costs are likely to go down         significantly  due to an improvement in   technology. This will       lead to a  decline in  the average selling price   per  gigabyte  (GB)      for SSDs, and cause SSDs to replace HDDs. To not get left  behind, Western Digital has been   focusing on enterprise SSDs as well.  The company acquired Hitachi GST (HGST) in  2012,  which brought a range  of enterprise SAS SSD product lines. A few days  back, HGST launched  the industry’s first 12Gb/s SAS SSD. Further, HGST  is working on the  high-end  PCI Express (PCIe) SSD product line. PCIe  SSDs are much  faster than SAS  SSDs, as SAS connect to the host computer   through  host adapters that in turn  connect to the PCIe interface. With  increasing demand for speedier access, PCIe SSDs are expected to see  higher growth going forward.On the retail side, we think Western Digital is taking the right  steps with its equal focus on SSDs   and hybrid storage drives. We  expect hybrid SSDs to gain more popularity in the near  term, as they   have performance  and  size  comparable to SSD drives while being   relatively cheaper. Western Digital’s wafer-thin 5mm hybrid drive is  designed for   use in hybrid laptops and    ultrabooks. [3]  Further, the company is continuously working   on development of SSDs  for  retail consumers, which will help it in the   long term.Disclosure: No positions."
1356411,23479,2013-04-21T05:26:03-04:00,,"Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC), one of the leading providers of electronic data storage products, has also seen its stock rise by more than 25% at one point this year to touch an all-time high of $53.75. Favorable trends for the overall storage sector can be accredited for this broad-based rally in the sector. Increasing demand for rich formats such as HD for media consumption is leading to growth in demand for high capacity disk drive solutions. In addition, the growth in cloud computing demand is boosting high capacity storage demand from enterprises.Below we take a detailed look at key trends, how Western Digital is addressing them and how this relates to our price estimate of $61.50.Remote storage is becoming a standard for most enterprises and has even gained traction with retail customers with services like iCloud, Dropbox, Skydrive and Google Drive. Further, more businesses are deploying cloud computing environments in an effort to pool resources and cut costs. Currently, hard disk drives (HDD) offer a more cost-efficient alternative to solid state drives (SSD), making them a more suitable option for developing and expanding cloud infrastructures, as capacity matters more than speed. Western Digital is a leader in the enterprise HDD space and already has several high performance products to offer. Further, the storage company is developing new helium filled drives, which once widely launched, are expected to provide it a significant advantage over competitors. These drives consume up to 23% less power while allowing for a nearly 40% jump in capacity.However, going forward SSD production costs are likely to go down significantly due to an improvement in technology, which should lead to a decline in the average selling price per gigabyte (GB) for SSDs. To keep up with the trend, Western Digital has been focusing on enterprise SSDs. The company acquired Hitachi GST in 2012, which brought a range of enterprise SSD product lines. [1] A few days back, HGST announced the industry's first 12Gb/s SAS SSD. [2] Further, HGST is working on the high-end PCI Express (PCIe) SSD product line. Mass storage interfaces like SATA and SAS connect to the host computer through host adapters that in turn connect to the PCIe interface; PCIe SSDs are much faster than SAS SSDs.PC, Tablet & Laptop Storage: Hybrid And Solid State Drives Are Key to GrowthMost leading laptop manufacturers are offering laptops with a hybrid HDD-SSD primary memory and high-end, high-performance laptops with complete SSD memory. These drives allow for faster data access compared with HDD. However, SSDs are currently much more expensive per GB than HDDs, leading to slow adoption of SSDs as primary memory components. On average, SSDs are at least twice as expensive as regular HDDs and this cost differential is still causing price-conscious customers and enterprises to look at HDDs. Therefore, we expect hybrid SSDs to gain more popularity in the near term as they have performance and size comparable to SSD drives while being relatively cheaper.However, in the long term SSD will be the key to growth. We estimate that tablet sales will outstrip notebook and netbook sales by the end of our forecast period. Tablet computers use solid state memory chips as their primary storage memory. The increasing popularity of tablet computers will lead to a surge in the SSD space. Further, as discussed previously, SSD costs are expected to come down going forward which should also boost the demand for SSDs.We believe Western Digital is taking the right steps with its equal focus on SSDs and hybrid storage drives. Its wafer-thin 5mm hybrid drive designed for use in hybrid laptops and ultrabooks gives the company an edge over HDD makers as well as SSD makers. [3] Further, the company is continuously working on development of SSDs for retail consumers, which will help it in the long term. This is one reason why we estimate a higher value for its PC, tablet and laptop storage unit over comparable players like Seagate.Growth In High Definition Digital Content Drives Storage RequirementThe high growth rate of digital content is driving the need for high capacity storage to aggregate, host, distribute, manage, back up and use digital content. The need to access rich data and content is being driven by a highly mobile and increasingly connected user base. The traditional enterprise and client compute markets will continue to demand high capacity storage solutions and will be best served by hard disk drives where manufacturers compete on their ability to deliver cost effective, reliable and energy efficient mass storage devices. The increasing demand for HD content for media consumption and rich formats such as HD DVD and Blu-Ray will drive demand for high capacity disk drive solutions in the end-user market.According to Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), global cloud traffic is going to grow at an annual rate of 45% and reach 4.3 zettabytes (1 zettabyte is equal to about 1 quadrillion GB) by 2016, while global data center traffic will grow to 6.6 zettabytes. [4] Nearly 20% of this data will be accounted for by online video streaming, email and music. Western Digital is leveraging this end-user content creating phenomenon with value added products such as DVR backups and wireless backup networks. The list also includes media storage devices designed to connect easily with different media sources such as TV's, radios and gaming consoles.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
1360351,31461,2013-04-23T03:34:37-04:00,,"SanDisk (SNDK) reported its Q1 revenue ended in March rose 11% y-o-y and 13% q-o-q to $1.34 billion. The company delivered an EPS of 84 cents against analysts' expectations of 79 cents. Overall the results have been impressive. SanDisk's CEO said:SanDisk is an emerging player in the SSD (solid state drive) game. The company's SSD sales made up approximately 10% of its total revenues in 2012. In this article I will dig deeper into SanDisk's long-term prospects in SSDs, while offering an analysis on SanDisk's relative valuation.SSDs: SanDisk's New Growth Catalyst?SanDisk's combined sales of Client and Enterprise SSDs tripled y-o-y in the most recent quarter, according to the company management. In the client market, SanDisk has begun shipment of new 19-nanometer SSDs to the retail and B2B channels. SanDisk expects it will continue to gain share and momentum in this market.SanDisk says it's well positioned to benefit from 5x5 caching and standalone SSDs, both of which are supplied to the vast majority of leading PC OEMs. Its Enterprise SSDs also posted strong y-o-y and sequential growth, setting a second consecutive record for quarterly revenue.""In the first quarter, for the first time, the majority of our Enterprise SSD revenue was derived using captive memory supply,"" CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said. ""These products are built with our 24-nanometer memory, and we expect to launch our next-generation SaaS and PCIe SSDs manufactured on our 19-nanometer technology in the second half of this year.""SSDs vs. Hybrids vs. HDDsAlthough SSDs are the newest forms of secondary storage, they've not yet gone mainstream. Hybrid drives are more popular, particularly in the consumer market, because of their cost effectiveness.It's well known that Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), SanDisk's no. 1 competitor in the secondary storage market, has been manufacturing its third generation 2.5-inch Momentus XT hybrid drive for quite some time. A hybrid 5mm drive is a very good fit for Ultrabooks and tablets, offering near-SSD speed and 500GB or more capacity at substantially less than SSD prices. Moreover, Seagate has begun to ship the world's first 4TB hard drives that feature 1TB platters. Seagate says that the four platter design is one that allows for the highest performance possible, while doubling capacity and reducing cost.Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), another player in this niche market, recently unveiled its new hybrid solid state technology known as SSHD at the CES this year. The new tech features the speed of a decent SSD, but the capacity that a mechanical HDD would feature. On top of that, Western Digital owned HGST (formerly Hitachi Global Storage Technology, but now a division of Western Digital) has recently brought out a new line of 12Gb/s SAS SSDs based on MLC flash. These are a part of the company's UltraStar line products. Whereas HGST's first-generation UltraStar SAS SSDs used SLC flash, the new SSDs are based on 25nm MLC flash but offer the same warranties as HGST's prior generation, according to a new report by The SSD Guy.SanDisk's Relative ValuationSNDK Return on Invested Capital data by YChartsSanDisk's ROIC stands at 5.78%, compared to Seagate's 51.44% and Western Digital's 23.11%. Against this, SanDisk is getting a PE of 27.24, compared to Seagate's 4.526 and Western Digital's 5.958. Since SanDisk is an established player in the smartphones game, which is a high growth market, SanDisk enjoys such an astronomically higher relative valuation.It's clear that the SSD market will take time to mature. Meanwhile, SanDisk will face fierce competition not only in the SSD market, but in the smartphones and tablets market as well. I don't think SanDisk's economic moat justifies its rich valuation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1370621,22263,2013-04-25T10:59:59-04:00,,"On 24th April Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) reported revenue of $3.8 billion, hard-drive shipments of 60.2 million and net income of $391 million, or $1.60 per share for its third fiscal quarter ended Mar. 29, 2013. On a non-GAAP basis, net income was $514 million or $2.10 per share. This handily beat street consensus of revenue of $3.6 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $1.77, an earnings beat of 18.6%.These results are all the more impressive in light of the recent negative news flow on the Personal Computing front, where market-research firm IDC estimated that PC sales are forecast to register a vertiginous decline of nearly 14% in the first quarter from a year earlier. IDC said it was the worst quarterly drop for PC shipments since it started tracking the data in 1994.As outlined in my Seeking Alpha article a year ago, the Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Industry has benefited from a fundamental change in the supply dynamics, and this change has not yet been fully digested by the stock market. (See Western Digital Hitachi Merger A Huge Positive For The Former, which summarizes the rapid consolidation in the industry and the better capacity discipline that is the result.) As WDC hovers around all-time highs in what was historically a deeply cyclical industry, I believe there is still ample room for the shares to run.(Click to enlarge)The basis of my buy recommendation is twofold: WDC is NOT hostage to the deteriorating outlook of Personal Computers; a rerating (i.e. a P/E or cashflow expansion in multiple) that reflects the reduced cyclicality of the industry.WDC is much more than PC'sAny reader who believes in the death of the laptop/desktop (as he squints at this article on his smartphone or elegantly sips cappuccino whilst browsing on his tablet) should review the earnings call transcript of WDC's conference call.One of the most important statements made was by the CFO, Wolfgang Nicki:To repeat, the majority of HDDs that WDC sells end up in gadgets other than the desktop and laptop. One must remember that the proliferation of devices, the explosion of data/photos/videos that is being created will, almost inevitably, end up being stored on a HDD, be it an external drive in your home or an enterprise server in the cloud.As for the well-publicized ""death of the hard-drive to be replaced by flash,"" this argument is simply groundless: for capacity starting at 100 gigabytes and going up, flash memory is still more expensive by a factor of 3 or greater, rendering it uneconomic in all but the most elitist devices. Furthermore, in response to the growing presence of tablets (most of which currently have flash-based memory), WDC has just launched a new ultra-thin 5 millimeter HDD, (Western Digital Ships World's First 5mm Laptop HDD And Hybrid Variant) which is very likely to find itself in the innards of the next generation of tablets. From the earnings call linked above, the CEO, Stephen Milligan states:The Rerating ArgumentSo what kind of valuation would you give a company that has reasserted its central role in the rapidly changing technology landscape? A company whose product is the storage bedrock of the information highway, whose past was plagued by a wild cyclicality in earnings, but whose future suggests a stable outlook in margins, coupled with a gently rising trajectory in volumes.The stars are aligned for a rerating in WDC's valuation.Let's start with their operating cashflow ($3 billion for the year, or $750 million per quarter) and take off capital expenditure, $800 million for the year, (as stated in the conference call linked above, i.e. the regular expenditure after the 2010 Thai floods). This gives a figure of $2.2 billion as post-capex operating cashflow in a year.The table below outlines a list of cashflow multiples and the resulting valuation, after taking account of the net cash on their balance sheet ($2.3 billion).Despite WDC shares currently being at an all-time high, the upside is still very compelling. In fact, even after the major recent run, the company is still currently valued at a bargain basement multiple of 5X cashflow.To put this into some perspective, the recent buyout offer for Dell (NYSE:DELL) - whose fortunes are far more entwined with the PC - is being made at a multiple between 9-10 times. In my opinion there are few opportunities as glaring as the one above. I hope the private equity group Silver Lake Partners (which is involved in the Dell buyout with the founder Michael Dell and who curiously enough, have once already been involved in a buyout of STX, floating it subsequently at a massive profit) are taking note…WDC is no longer a PC component supplier, it's a play on digital storage. And it's a BuyDisclosure: I am long WDC. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1349071,24105,2013-04-17T16:48:11-04:00,,"I wrote an article about Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) this past December 17 when STX (now $34.80) was trading at $27.68 and WDC (now $51.18) was trading at $37.78. Several people have asked whether I still like them at current market prices; the answer is an emphatic, ""yes."" As I have said before, I would buy both of them to cover any risk that one or the other steals market share from its prime competitor. Because the two of them combined now control over 90% of the disk drive market, this strategy eliminates one important source of risk.STX and WDC are similar in many ways: they each have a fiscal year which ends at the end of June, they each have recently acquired a large competitor (STX acquired Samsung's operations in late 2011; WDC acquired Hitachi's operations in March 2012) , they each have strong balance sheets, and they each are trading at very low multiples to earnings and cash flow. The table below provides Monday's closing price, current dividend yield, net balance sheet cash per share, trailing twelve months earnings per share and price earnings ratio (based on trailing twelve months earnings). Stock prices and current yields are derived from Yahoo Financial; earnings and balance sheet information is derived from each company's filings with the SEC.As you can see, each of these companies is throwing off a lot of cash, and the cash output has continued nicely into fiscal 2013. The two companies have followed different strategies in deploying the cash which continues to gush over the transom each month. STX has emphasized share repurchases while WDC has built up balance sheet cash. WDC management has committed to devoting 50% of cash flow to a combination of dividends and share repurchases going forward so that more repurchases are likely to materialize.For each company, fiscal 2013 started last July and, as of the financial statements released for the quarter ending December 2012, we were halfway through the fiscal year. The table below provides the dollar amount of share repurchases and the percentage reduction in share count over the first 6 months of fiscal 2013 based on each company's SEC filings and share count information on each company's website.STX was much more aggressive on the repurchase front and reduced its share count considerably in a short period of time. WDC was more conservative and has built up balance sheet cash, which, as noted above, is likely to be targeted at repurchases going forward.Although many investors are lukewarm toward share repurchases and - at the same time - are enthusiastic about dividend increases, it is important to understand the relationship between the two. Share repurchases reduce share count, and thereby make future dividend increases less expensive. Buying shares back when a company's stock is trading at a cheap price is a great way to set the stage for generous dividend increases in the future.The coming quarterly reports of each company should be interesting. STX paid extra dividends in December in anticipation of the tax law change and skipped first quarter dividends (which were essentially prepaid in December). That means that STX likely had extra cash in the most recent quarter; it will be interesting to see how it was deployed.The next few quarters will tell us a lot about WDC and STX. The quarter ending March 31, 2013, will be the first quarter in which we will be able to see a meaningful year over year comparison of STX, including the Samsung acquisition. For WDC, we will have to wait until the quarter ending June 30, 2013, for similar year over year comparison of WDC including the Hitachi acquisition. We are also now operating in a market with much less competition than we have had in the past, and it will be interesting to see how prices hold up.The negative thesis on WDC and STX has generally been that they are each tied to the PC market and that the decline in PC sales will be devastating to them. On the other hand, there is significant evidence that they will profit from the ever expanding need for cheap storage at data centers. In this regard, WDC has increased enterprise sales from 1.7 million units to 6.6 million units on a year over year quarterly basis as of the last quarter (based on information on its most recent quarterly earnings report filed with the SEC). The financial impacts of these changes are likely to be revealed in the next several quarters.WDC and STX are now priced for the worst possible expectations in terms of income and cash flow. Pundits have been predicting the demise of these companies for a very long time, and they just keep cranking out cash flow. At this point, the purchase of these two stocks offers one of the better risk reward trade offs in the market today.Disclosure: I am long STX, WDC.

1354601,23479,2013-04-19T12:42:51-04:00,,"Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC), one of the leading providers of electronic data  storage products, has also seen its stock rise by more than 25% at one point this  year to touch an all-time high of $53.75. Favorable trends for the overall storage sector can be credited for this broad-based rally in the sector. Increasing demand for rich formats  such as  HD for media consumption is leading to growth in demand for  high  capacity disk drive solutions. In addition, growth in cloud  computing  demand is boosting high capacity storage demand from  enterprises.Below  we take a detailed look at key trends and the way Western Digital is addressing them.Enterprise Business To Ride On Demand From Cloud Computing And Remote Storage Remote storage is becoming a standard for most     enterprises and  has even gained traction with retail customers with   services like  iCloud,  Dropbox, Skydrive and Google Drive. Further, more   businesses  are deploying cloud computing environments in an effort to   pool  resources    and cut costs. Currently, hard disk drives (HDD) offer a  more cost-efficient alternative to solid state drives (SSD), making them a more suitable    option for developing and expanding cloud  infrastructures, as capacity    matters more than speed. Western  Digital is a leader in the enterprise HDD space and already has several     high performance products to offer. Further, the storage company is  developing  new  helium filled drives,     which once widely launched, are expected to provide it a significant     advantage over competitors. These drives consume  up    to 23% less power while allowing for a nearly 40% jump in  capacity.However,  going forward SSD production costs are likely to go down       significantly  due to an improvement in   technology, which  should     lead to a  decline in  the average selling price   per  gigabyte (GB)     for SSDs. To keep up with the trend, Western Digital has been  focusing on enterprise SSDs. The company acquired Hitachi GST in  2012, which brought a range of enterprise SSD product lines. [1] A few days  back, HGST announced the industry’s first 12Gb/s SAS SSD. [2] Further, HGST  is working on the high-end PCI Express (PCIe) SSD product line. Mass  storage interfaces like SATA and SAS connect to the host computer  through host adapters that in turn connect to the PCIe interface; PCIe  SSDs are much faster than SAS SSDs.PC, Tablet & Laptop Storage: Hybrid And Solid State Drives Are Key to Growth  Most leading laptop manufacturers are offering laptops  with   a   hybrid HDD-SSD primary memory and high-end, high-performance    laptops  with  complete SSD memory. These drives allow for faster  data  access compared with HDD. However, SSDs are currently much  more    expensive per GB than HDDs,  leading to slow adoption of SSDs as   primary memory components. On  average, SSDs   are at least twice as     expensive as regular HDDs and  this cost   differential is still causing     price-conscious customers  and enterprises   to look at HDDs.  Therefore, we expect hybrid SSDs to gain more popularity in the near  term as they have performance  and  size  comparable to SSD drives while being relatively cheaper.However, in the long term SSD will be the key to growth. We estimate  that tablet sales will   outstrip  notebook   and   netbook  sales  by  the end of our forecast   period. Tablet  computers  use  solid  state memory chips as their   primary      storage  memory. The  increasing  popularity of tablet    computers will lead to a surge in   the SSD space. Further, as discussed previously, SSD costs are  expected to come down going forward which should also boost the demand for  SSDs.We believe Western Digital is taking the right steps with its equal focus on SSDs and hybrid storage drives. Its wafer-thin 5mm hybrid drive designed for use in hybrid laptops and    ultrabooks gives    the company an edge over HDD makers as well   as SSD makers.  [3] Further, the company is continuously working on development of SSDs for  retail consumers, which will help it in the long term. This is  one reason why we estimate a higher value   for its PC, tablet  and  laptop storage unit over comparable players  like  Seagate.Growth In High Definition Digital Content Drives Storage RequirementThe high growth rate of digital content is driving the need for high     capacity storage to aggregate, host, distribute, manage, back up and   use   digital content. The need to access rich data and content is  being    driven by a highly mobile and increasingly connected user base.  The    traditional enterprise and client compute markets will continue  to    demand high capacity storage solutions and will be best served by  hard    disk drives where manufacturers compete on their ability to  deliver cost    effective, reliable and energy efficient mass storage  devices. The    increasing demand for HD content for media consumption  and rich formats  such as HD DVD and Blu-Ray will drive demand for high  capacity disk    drive solutions in the end-user market.According to Cisco, global cloud traffic is going to grow at an annual rate   of 45% and reach   4.3 zettabytes (1 zettabyte is equal to about 1   quadrillion GB) by 2016, while global data center traffic will grow to    6.6  zettabytes. [4] Nearly 20% of this data will be accounted for by   online  video  streaming, email and music. Western Digital is leveraging  this  end-user  content  creating phenomenon with value added products  such   as DVR backups and wireless backup networks. The list also  includes   media storage  devices designed to connect easily with  different media   sources such as  TV’s, radios and gaming consoles. Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
1340451,32001,2013-04-15T00:15:13-04:00,,"We never like to be hyperbolic for the Seeking Alpha readership since we assume that readers want somewhat measured and analytical commentary about the various markets and securities, but when Sandisk (SNDK) reports their q1 '13 financial results after the bell on April 17th, 2013, we full expect to see a blow-out quarter from the NAND flash manufacturer, with some gas in the tank for the rest of 2013.SNDK was our best performing stock in client accounts in Q1 '13, up about 25%, which was only a recovery from the 2nd quarter of 2012, when SNDK was our worst performing stock, falling from $50 to the low $30s between early April and late June in 2012.The issue in Q2 '12 was very weak NAND pricing and a strong yen, both of which crushed gross margins, as SNDK's gross margin fell from 43% in q4 '12 to 33% in q1 '12 to 27% in Q2 '12, as the confluence of excess supply, weak pricing and the stronger yen, wreaked havoc on SNDK.Today, those early 2012 headwinds are now becoming tailwinds, as we have stable NAND pricing, and a much weaker yen, and we expect the Q1 and Q2 2013 quarters to show a sharp recovery in gross margins and earnings per share.That being said, there is a lot of bullish sentiment around the stock, which is making us nervous as we head into Wednesday's, April 17th, 2013 earnings report after the bell.Analyst consensus is looking for $0.78 on $1.3 billion in revenues for expected year-over-year growth of 24% and 7% respectively. However it is the 2nd and 3rd calendar quarters of 2013 where we really get the easy compares against the collapse of NAND flash prices last year, not to mention the weak bit growth.Here is how this year's estimates compare to last year's equivalent quarter:The bottom row is SNDK's actual EPS by quarter in 2012.The 3rd row is SNDK's estimated EPS by quarter for 2013.The 2nd row is the expected y/y growth this year.My question as a portfolio manager is how much of the expected good results and easy compares are already in the stock price ?Here is SNDK's recent EPS history:*Source: ThomsonReuters dataAs the reader can quickly see, SNDK's earnings are notoriously volatile, and earnings and profitability can change quickly for the flash maker.* Source: ThomsonReuters dataAfter the debacle during the summer of 2012, EPS estimates bottomed in the July, August period and began to work higher, but readers should note how fast estimates fell off the table in early 2012. Note the rapid decline in the 2013 and 2014 estimate.The point is, the competitive environment changes quickly for SNDK.What is SNDK's peak earnings per share capability? As the reader can see at one point in late 2011, analyst consensus was looking for $8.78 per share, but today, I think analysts are shell-shocked after 2012, and may only think SNDK is capable of earning $6 per share in ideal conditions.We've modeled the stock as far back as the late 1990s and one thing that has struck me is that - like a lot of cyclical stocks - when the stock looks the cheapest from an earnings and cash-flow perspective is when you want to be selling rather than buying the name.Peak gross margin was 52% in September, 2010, versus 40% last quarter, but expect that metric to improve markedly with the weak yen the last two quarters.There are a lot of positives around SNDK's fundamental story currently:We have a full position in the stock, but might look to be trimming as we move through the summer of 2013. Peak earnings power is still a big question mark: if it is $6 per share if SNDK can expand margins materially, then the stock might have all the good news discounted in its price currently.I think the key metric to watch over the next few months will be NAND flash pricing and SNDK's comments about non-captive supply.If SNDK can earn $8 per share, then we could have more material price appreciation ahead.At 22(x) cash-flow currently, know what you own and don't overstay your welcome.Disclosure: I am long SNDK.

1367781,39791,2013-04-24T16:14:15-04:00,,"Sandisk (SNDK) is one of the biggest memory companies in the world with a dominating presence in NAND memory. The company is a vertically integrated memory producer that is present in all parts of the NAND memory supply chain from chip production to retail sales. Sandisk also has one of the strongest patent portfolios in the technology industry, with over 4,400 patents. The technology industry is increasingly using NAND memory, which is improving the investment case for SNDK. The shift towards mobile devices has increased the demand for flash memory tremendously. With the PC industry also starting to use more NAND memory, the upward trend for SNDK is set to continue. NAND memory prices have increased by ~30% in the last few months, even as demand is set to outpace supply growth. Samsung (OTC:SSNGY), which is the world's largest producer of NAND memory, is seeking to source supplies from Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) for its new S4 smartphone. SNDK's stock has fallen after the recent quarterly results, giving an opportunity for investors to invest in the stock.Why I like Sandisk1) Industry Consolidation - The memory industry has seen the exit of numerous companies in the last couple of decades, and only 4 companies with meaningful capacities are left. In DRAM, there are only three big companies, of which two are Korean (Samsung, Hynix) while the other one is American (Micron (NASDAQ:MU)). In NAND, the market is dominated by Sandisk - Toshiba and Samsung with Micron and Hynix having minor capacities. The number of companies in the memory industry has continued to decline since the 1990s with the exit of Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) and most of the Japanese conglomerates. The last few years have been even more brutal for the industry with the bankruptcy/ takeover of some of the biggest remaining players like Spansion, Qimonda and Elpida.2) Memory Market is on a cyclical upswing - The memory industry goes through periodic up and down cycles. After a tough last two years, the memory market seems to be on a strong upswing with both DRAM and NAND prices rising. The sales of tablets and smartphones are surging, leading to a growing demand for flash memory which is used by these computing devices. 3) Enterprise and Consumer Solid State Drive [SSD] Adoption - Sandisk is one of the biggest players in the SSD industry, and is growing strongly as consumers and enterprises increase their adoption of solid state memory products. SNDK's sales to this segment more than tripled in the current quarter.4) Beneficiary of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) - Samsung rivalry - Apple has a very awkward relationship with Samsung. Samsung is Apple's biggest competitor in smartphones and tablets, while at the same time, is Apple's biggest component supplier. Apple is already trying to shift its application processors from Samsung to TSMC (NYSE:TSM). Currently Toshiba-Sandisk is the only major supplier of NAND memory apart from Samsung. Micron is more of a DRAM player rather than a NAND supplier.5) NAND prices are going up - NAND memory prices have been going up sharply in the last 6 months, as major suppliers are not building capacity fast enough to meet demand. The memory industry is seeing more discipline due to fewer players. The price increase for NAND memory chips have climbed by 6-12% in April6) NAND Memory shortage - Sandisk-Toshiba is the world's second largest NAND memory producer and will benefit from the increasing adoption of Solid State Drives in consumer devices. The increasing demand for tablets and smartphones is boosting the demand for NAND memory. The prices for NAND are already up in Q412. Samsung is reportedly buying memory from its competitors due to the memory shortage.7) One of the largest spenders on NAND memory - There are not many companies that have the capacity to build semiconductor fabs that cost $4-5 billion these days. Sandisk along with Toshiba are amongst the top 10 semiconductor spenders in the world. Both the companies invest exclusively on building NAND fabs unlike Samsung, Hynix and Micron, which spend money on both NAND and DRAM memory.8) Patent Power - Sandisk has one of the most powerful patent portfolios in the technology industry. The quality of SanDisk's patents is ranked ahead of industry heavyweights like Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). IEEE Spectrum has ranked Sandisk at No.4 in its patent portfolio scorecard.SNDK made over $100 million from royalties and patent license in the current quarter.9) Strong Balance Sheet and Cash Flows - Sandisk increased its gross cash and marketable securities in Q1 by almost $500 million to nearly $6.2 billion, bringing net cash to over $4.2 billion. The company generates a significant amount of revenue from patents. These are very high quality revenues which go directly to the bottom line without any major corresponding costs. The company will keep generating strong free cash flows as long as the NAND memory industry keeps growing. With IDC projecting strong growth in tablet and smartphone shipments in the next 5 years, SNDK should keep growing at a rapid pace.10) Margin Improvement - Sandisk's gross margins have been improving in the last few years, and they are expected to reach 43% (midpoint of 42-44% guidance) in 2013, as the company rapidly reduces costs. The company is already moving production to the 19 nm process node from 24 nm node and plans to move to the 1Y node by the end of the year. The company is expanding bit capacity through productivity improvements.Risksa) Stock Performance - Sandisk has climbed from ~$5 during the depths of the Lehman crisis to ~$52 now, driven by the company's improving performance. The stock now trades at 10% below its all time peak of ~$58 reached in early 2013.b) Supply growth constrained - Sandisk is limiting increase in NAND memory capacity to keep pricing in check. The stock fell after the recent quarterly results, as analysts were disappointed that the company was not increasing capacity. Management said that SNDK's bit growth capacity will be 30-40% lower than the growth expected for the broader industry in 2013. However, I view this development as a positive one because it shows the memory industry is becoming more intelligent and disciplined. During the previous peaks, memory companies would go overboard in their capacity expansion leading to huge losses during downturns.c) Technology Risk - The reduction in process geometries which leads to cost reduction and bit growth is becoming more complex and capital intensive. The shift from the 19 nm process node to 1Y node and 1Z node is expected to be highly capital intensive. The technology roadmap towards 3D memory technology is also hazy at this point of time. Other competitors in the semiconductor industry like Intel , Samsung and TSMC are much larger and spend more on R&D. If SNDK fails to keep up with technology developments, then it might get priced out of the memory industry.ValuationSNDK is not expensive with a P/S and P/B ratio of 2.5x and 1.7x respectively, with a forward P/E of ~12x. The company has seen a rapid growth in sales and earnings in the last 5 years, but valuation multiples are still cheap. The recent pullback in stock price provides a good opportunity for investors to get into a secular growth story.SummaryI think that Sandisk will continue to benefit from the technology industry shift towards mobile devices. The consolidation of the memory industry is helping reduce the cyclical nature of the industry. Sandisk is one of the strongest memory companies with a strong patent portfolio and presence across all parts of the memory supply chain. Sandisk also has a strong presence in Solid State Drives which are seeing increasing adoption by Enterprises and retail consumers. The usage of SSDs will keep expanding in the next 5 years, which should benefit Sandisk. I think that investors should look to start building a position in SanDisk, taking advantage of the recent stock pullback.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

It is a pioneer in NAND technologies and holds many key patents. Its stock has recovered well after June last year, when it fell from around $50 to $30 in just two months. Since then it has been following an upward trend. The company announced its quarterly earnings recently in which its revenue grew by more than 11% year-on-year while it reported an EPS of $0.84 against an estimate of $0.79. The retail channels produced year-over-year revenue growth of 34%. This performance was much better than the consensus estimate.I see 5 good reasons why this stock looks like a buy to me. Let me enumerate them -SSD growthIn Q1 2013, SSD products contributed 20 percent of the total sales for the company. This was a 200% increase over last year same quarter. The combined sales of Client and Enterprise solid state devices tripled year-on-year. The company expects the SSD share in revenues to increase to 25% of the total sales in 2014.According to a report, the market for enterprise SSDs will grow from 3,82,000 units in 2011, to 3.9 million units in 2016, representing average annual growth forecast of 59%. This will increase the SSD revenues from $582 million in 2011, to $3.5 billion in 2016, an average annual rate of 43%. This growth will be driven by SSD price decline, HDD substitution and internet growth. The two graphics below further substantiates the point.If the company is able to capture a substantial market share of cloud based enterprise SSD, it will lead to an increase in the upside potential of the stock.Stabilization of ASP per gigabyte of flash memoryThe average selling price per gigabyte of flash memory has declined from $3 in 2008 to around $0.50 in 2012. This is further expected to come down in the future, but the rate of decline might slow down. This is because a lot of manufacturers might cut flash memory production in the coming years. This will reduce the gap between supply and demand, leading to a slowdown in the fall in prices. This will help the company in focusing on capturing more market share, rather than worrying about the continuous fall in prices, further increasing the upside potential.Flash memory market shareThe graph below is an indication of the market share of SanDisk in the flash memory segment over the years.The market share of the company fell from around 40% in 2011 to 30% in 2012. This was because of the entrance of many new players in the market (like Seagate). The company has made efforts to defend its market share by striking a deal with some OEMs (like NVIDIA) and is expected to regain its market share in the near future due to its extensive ties with the leading OEMs.Surge in tablet and smartphone demandDue to current trends in the demand of tablet and smartphones around the world, specially emerging countries, the company is set to increase its SSD sales in the years to come. Also as a majority of these devices have card slots, the company is expected to increase its sales of SanDisk Ultra mobile cards.Yen effectWeakening of yen will further help the company in increasing its gross profit. The company recently stated in its quarterly earnings conference call that a 10% movement in the yen to dollar exchange rate will increase the gross margins of the company by 300 basis points. This will ultimately lead to a higher net income and thus higher valuation.ConclusionThe trailing P/E ratio of the company is much higher than the industry average, but its forward P/E ratio is a bit lower. This indicates an expected increase in the EPS of the company. The growth forecast in EPS for the next five years is higher than the semiconductor industry. This means currently the stock might be a little overvalued and has little short-term gain potential.But over a period of the next two years, the five factors mentioned above will drive the growth of the company. The company has raised its estimated revenues from $5.6 billion to $5.75 billion next year. Gross margins are also expected to increase from 41% to 43%. Investors might buy the stock when it reaches around $50 and hold it for a sufficient period of time to get considerable returns.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1352401,35521,2013-04-18T15:38:07-04:00,,"SanDisk Corporation (SNDK), with a market cap of $13.48B, is a global leader in the NAND flash memory market. SanDisk designs, develops and manufactures data storage solutions in a range of form factors using its flash memory, controller and firmware technologies. SanDisk's management is expecting a healthy supply/demand balance this year and has raised its 2013 revenue target and given a forecast for June-quarter revenue that beat analysts' expectations. As reported by Bloomberg, SanDisk is limiting increases in output from its factories and expects enough demand to keep prices healthy this year.Q1, 2013 ResultStrong SSD GrowthThe highlights for Q1, 2013 was the revenue from SSD product, which grew over 200% on a year-over-year basis. Global retail channels also showed strength and produced 34% revenue growth as compare to the last year.Increasing Retail MixAs I described last quarter, the company is now reporting the channel mix of revenue as retail and commercial. The commercial channel includes OEM customers, B2B customers, direct enterprise customers and licensees. The total Q1 revenue was 62% commercial and 38% retail, reflecting a year-over-year mix shift toward retail of 6 percentage point driven by strong growth in that channel.Increasing MarginThe non-GAAP gross margin increased from 39.9% in Q4 to 40.5% in Q1. The product gross margin remained about the same sequentially, with the license and royalty revenue driving the sequential increase in total gross margin. Both ASP per gigabyte and cost per gigabyte increased 2% sequentially, with the increase in both metrics driven largely by product mix.Increasing Cash Position and Cash FlowOn the balance sheet, gross cash and marketable securities increased in Q1 by almost $500M to nearly $6.2B, bringing net cash to over $4.2B. The inventory balance decreased modestly in Q1 as the company is supply-constrained in several areas. Operating cash flow was $474M, highest Q1 record. $54M of repayments was received from the joint ventures while $48M was spent on the property and equipment during Q1.Analysts' Call and EstimatesAnalysts currently have a mean target price of $58.78 for SNDK, suggesting 5.49% upside potential based on the closing price of $55.72 as of April 17, 2013. Analysts, on average, are estimating an EPS of $3.84 with revenue of $5.63B, which is 11.40% higher than 2012. For 2014, analysts are projecting an EPS of $4.35 with revenue of $6.19B, which is 9.90% higher than 2013.Fundamentally, SNDK's key stats will be compared to its peers in the industry of data storage, including Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC).Source: MorningstarDespite the lower revenue growth and margins comparing to hard-disk-drive manufacturing, SanDisk's SSDs are eating into HDD sales. Thus, SanDisk enjoys a much higher P/E as compared to STX and WDC. Further, a quick comparison will be reviewed between SNDK and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), a global manufacturer and marketer of DRAM, NAND Flash memory and other semiconductor components, as well as the averages for the industry of semiconductor memory.Source: MorningstarSanDisk has achieved a much higher margins and ROE as compared to MU and the industry average. SanDisk also has a higher revenue growth as compared to the industry average. From the valuation perspective, SanDisk remains undervalued with its Forward P/E of 13.4, which is lower than MU and the industry average.Technically, SNDK continues to be on the long-term uptrend since mid-November, 2012. However, in the near-term, SNDK is approaching its long-term uptrend support, as seen from the chart below.(Click to enlarge)Source: Finviz.comBottom LineSanDisk is playing smart and safe by controlling its output, thus to achieve a favorable market price. SNDK remains a solid holding as it continues to improve its balance sheet and increase its cash flow while successfully grow its SSD market and increase its retail channels. However, investors need to be aware that SNDK is still facing commodity like and cyclical natures of flash memory market. For bullish investors, a credit put option spread of July 20, 2013 $42/$45 put can be reviewed to gain some upside credit premium or to acquire SNDK shares at a price below $45 upon options expiration.Note: Investors and traders are recommended to do their own due diligence and research before making any trading/investing decisions.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in SNDK over the next 72 hours.

1345321,30301,2013-04-16T15:06:02-04:00,,"SanDisk (SNDK) was originally scheduled to be play on Friday, April 12, 2013 for a long trade ahead of earnings this week. Monika Garg at Pacific Crest Securities and Sidney Ho at Nomura Securities both said they recommend owning shares of the stock ahead of an expected earnings beat and raised guidance from the company. However, with the stock having already broken to new highs, much of our statistical edge for a trade ahead of the news is gone and we removed the stock from our play list.(Click to enlarge)Yet, as Dean Grumlose at Stifel Nicholaus said, the company still has tailwinds. One tailwind is the Japanese yen, which has dropped approximately 10% since the last time SanDisk reported results. Dan Niles at AlphaOne Capital said this alone should add 4% to SanDisk's gross margins. The company's guidance for the first quarter was for revenue of $1.225 billion to $1.30 billion with gross margins of 36% to 40%. Throw in operating expenses of $225 million and a tax rate of 28% for the quarter, we calculate a range of $0.64 to $0.87 per share. The consensus earnings estimate is right in the middle of this range at $0.75 per share. Bump the gross margin range up by 2% to 4% with the move in the Yen, and we get a range of $0.71 to $1.02. This puts upside room to the Earnings Whisper ® number of $0.89 per share.This is without factoring in the upside potential for the top line. Demand for NAND memory has been growing at the same time wafer supply has been limited, thus pushing NAND prices higher. Mehdi Hosseini at Susquehanna Financial said this has led to positive checks throughout the quarter. Thus, there is upside risk to estimates even without factoring in the decline in the Yen... and the same upside exists to the company's 2013 guidance and fiscal year estimates.The company's guidance was for revenue of $5.3 billion to $5.6 billion, gross margins of 39% to 43%, and operating expenses of $1.05 billion, and a tax rate of 30.5%. By our math, this puts earnings at $2.89 to $3.87 per share. The consensus earnings estimate has ticked higher throughout the quarter from $3.51 to $3.84 per share. Adding the margin upside due to the decline in the Yen, we get a range of $3.20 to $4.50 per share. So the consensus estimate is already at the mid-point of this range, but analysts get there using revenue above the company's guidance with $5.63 billion. As we've pointed out several times in the past, it is statistically positive for stock prices ahead and through a company's earnings release when analysts have estimates above the company's guidance. Using the consensus revenue estimates and the revised gross margins due to the move in the Yen, we get a mid-point of $4.06 per share.These expectations are important because, while an earnings miss has a significant negative impact on the stock, there has been little net movement from a simple beat of the consensus estimates for SanDisk in the past. Since 2005, when the company has beat the consensus earnings estimate it has meant almost nothing. On average, when the company beats the consensus estimate, the stock has gapped higher by only 0.05%, then traded down 1.20% and remained in the red for a week before starting to see some recovery. Not coincidently, there has only been one time in the past 15 years that the company beat consensus estimates but missed the Earnings Whisper ® number and the stock still gapped higher on the news. So, the ideal trade for a short after the news on a whisper miss hasn't been available too often for a stock that has averaged a 12.1% move on earnings. On the other hand, there have been 18 times when the company beat the Earnings Whisper ® number and the stock has averaged a gap higher of 3.89% on the news. On a gap higher this quarter though, we need the stock to hold above $59 to confirm additional upside.SanDisk is scheduled to report earnings after the market closes on Wednesday, April 17, 2013 with a conference call at 5:00 PM ETDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in SNDK over the next 72 hours.

1339401,34821,2013-04-14T04:18:48-04:00,,"That wonderful time is upon us. Four times each year we enjoy the excitement of possible huge successes as our favorite companies release their quarterly results and give us a hint at what's to come down the road. For some of us stock market junkies, it's a little like having Christmas four times a year. Every morning we tip-toe down to our computer to see what goodies have come our way since yesterday's market close.Last week I wrote an article about the first company with weekly options to announce in April, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) (How To Play The JPMorgan Earnings Announcement). Even though the company exceeded expectations by a wide margin, the stock fell slightly after the announcement and the option positions I proposed racked up nice double-digit gains after commissions. Once again, expectations played a more important role in what the stock price did than the actual numbers announced by the company.Let's check out some interesting numbers for the big companies who announce next week (source of Whisper Number, Option Volatility and Average Change - EarningsWhispers.com):The highlighted numbers are the percentage change expected in the stock by the implied volatility (IV) of the options and the Average Change is the historic absolute change after earnings compiled by WhispersNumbers.com. The final column is the difference between IV of the May and April option numbers. The greater this number, the greater the incentive to sell April option premiums while it is so high. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and SanDisk (SNDK), and to a lesser degree, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), offer the greatest opportunities for collecting expensive option premiums through calendar or diagonal spreads.Maybe the most interesting figures for option traders are the percentage change that option prices are predicting by their volatility and the Average Change that has historically taken place after earnings. Option prices for Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and GOOG are predicting almost double the percentage changes in the stock that historically have occurred, suggesting that calendar spreads (at strikes both above and below the stock price) might be the best bet for those two companies.For some inexplicable (at least to me) reason, IV of April options (24) for BAX is less than IV of the May options (30) even though they announce earnings just before the April options expire. Since expectations seem to be low for this stock, an outright buy of April 70 calls would seem to be a great move if you were bullish on the stock - they can almost be bought at their intrinsic value (a highly unusual situation just prior to earnings).For stock buyers, earnings season can bring nice gains if you can figure out in advance if expectations are unusually high (or low) prior to the announcement. History has shown time after time that the level of expectations is far more important than the actual numbers. How many times have we seen a company exceed expectations on earnings, revenues, margins, and guidance, and then watch the stock fall after the good news is out? It is the most frustrating of all investing experiences, and it surely has happened to everyone who has been in the market for more than a couple of calendar quarters.So what does the table say about expectations? Whisper numbers are higher than expectations for all seven companies, but they exceed expectations by a huge amount for SNDK - the whisper number is 18.7% higher than expectations, the stock has moved higher by a large margin over the last week and month, and it is currently trading at a 52-week high. I think there is an excellent chance that SNDK will trade lower after Wednesday's after-close announcement, but I would wait until late in the day to sell it short because it might continue its upward climb early in the week.For option players, SNDK's exceptionally high expectation level suggests that it would a good time to buy a put. Buying puts would be a better bet than placing option spreads because option prices are much lower than historical post-earnings fluctuations. However, if the outright purchase of a put is too scary, a good bet might be to buy a May 57.5 put and sell an April 55 put (cost for the diagonal spread, $1.63). This spread would make money if the stock stayed flat or fell by any amount. (I plan to do this trade in my personal account.)Expectations also seem particularly high for GS (whisper numbers are 9.4% above expectations and the stock climbed more than the S&P 500 last week) although it is trading slightly lower than it was month ago. In my opinion, GS could be a short sale candidate late in the day on Monday, although not as compelling as the short sale of SNDK on Wednesday afternoon. Since April option prices are predicting almost double the average stock price move that has taken place historically, it would be best to sell those options rather than buying them. An ideal spread in my opinion would be a calendar spread at a strike below the stock price - this would have a maximum gain if the stock fell to that strike after the announcement.The company with the third highest level of expectations is Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), (whisper numbers are 7.1% above expectations) but the stock rose less than the market last week, and has fallen by 5.5% over the last month. Bottom line, there does not seem to be as strong a reason to short MS prior to the announcement.It is interesting to note that the stock price for every company on the list moved higher last week in advance of the earnings week, but this must be viewed in the context of the entire market for the week - SPY rose 2.3% so the last four companies on the list rose by less than that, indicating that perhaps expectations have lowered for those companies.Relatively low expectations seem to be in place for Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB), BAX, and GOOG. All three have whisper numbers barely above expectations, and rose only about half as much as the market did last week. If any of the companies on this list make big upward moves after announcing next week, these three might be the ones to do it.Earnings season is upon us, and what stock prices for the above seven companies do next week after announcements could very well be precursors to what the market in general does over the next few months. It will be exciting to watch the action.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in SNDK over the next 72 hours.

1330881,22787,2013-04-10T15:57:01-04:00,,"One of the hallmarks of a strong bull market is the rotation of ""smart money"" to new sectors and the emergence of new leadership as a subsequent market up-leg begins. For investors who believe this bull market still has legs, we would urge you to consider tech-stalwart SanDisk Corp. (SNDK). After consolidating for the past three years, SanDisk appears ready to begin another significant move. While we do not expect the same meteoric rises as 2003, when it increased from $8 to $40, or 2008, when the stock moved from $10 to $50, a number of new data points suggest that what began as a flirtation for the Street in December of last year, could develop into a two-three more quarter affair.As IPI dug into the SanDisk story over the past few weeks, we were struck by the number of bullish trends now converging upon the company at once. Most notably, NAND pricing has been very strong. According to DRAMeXchange, a research division of TrendForce, NAND manufacturers have been restricting supplies toward their channel market clients. Prices of low density MLC and TLC products have each gone up more than 10% due to surging demand from the smartphone, tablet and ultrabook markets. Since the Chinese New Year (February 10th) through the first half of March, pricing increased by 20% for 16GB MLCs, 32 GB MLCs, and for 32GB TLCs. Investors can take note of the dramatically improved pricing trends here:And here:The strong demand for NAND seen in the company's typically weak first quarter is one reason why we expect SanDisk to report a nice beat when it reports Q2 earnings on April 17th. In turn, analysts' forward estimates and price targets should also move higher for the stock.In addition to firm pricing for NAND, SanDisk is benefiting from increased sales of its solid-state drive (SSD) product lines. The company has been consistently innovating and improving its SSD products and customers have responded in kind. For instance, in June of 2012, SNDK introduced two new enterprise memory express products, the Lightning PCIe SSD and the SCSI Express. Developing first generation products like this should help bolster SanDisk's position as an SSD market leader and lead to continued gains in market share in the upcoming quarters. Moreover, SanDisk has not simply rested on its laurels. The company continues to innovate and bring new SSD products to market. In January of this year, SNDK introduced the cost-effective Ultra Plus/X110 and U100 SSD lines, for the budget-minded consumer/PC maker, which should go a long way towards making the SSD more ubiquitous in new desktops, notebooks and tablets. Of note, the U100 SSD was recently included in the new ASUS Transformer Book.As SanDisk's SSD sales have ramped, this product group has grown into a meaningful portion of total revenues as well. In Q4 2012, SanDisk reported that SSD sales accounted for $150 million or 10% of the company's overall revenues versus $50 million in Q4 2011. During its January earnings conference call, management also added that they expected SSD revenue to increase sequentially in Q1 2013 in both dollar terms and as an overall percentage of total revenue. Looking ahead to 2014, SanDisk anticipates SSD's percentage of total sales to grow to 25%. Such comments, coupled with the higher margins of the SSD product line, are another reason why we expect a solid beat in earnings on April 17th. With SSDs alone approaching $160-$170 million in Q1 revenues, the consensus estimate of $0.77 on $1.3 billion in sales seems too conservative.During the company's Q4 earnings call, SNDK's management also highlighted how their newly expanded embedded portfolio has experienced record-breaking sales:This is yet another significant reason why we believe a significant beat is on the way in Q1 for SanDisk.Looking ahead, investors should keep in mind that SanDisk is unhedged against the falling yen for the second half of 2013. Considering that 60% of its COGS are denominated in the Japanese currency, this sets the stage for higher gross margins in the back half of the year. This should translate into further bullish guidance for the next few quarters.The Street Begins To Cuddle Up To SanDiskNot surprisingly, the Street has begun to cuddle up closer to SanDisk, awarding the company 6 upgrades and estimate increases over the past six weeks. We believe this is just the first wave of analyst upgrades and price target increases. For now, here is a quick summary of the recent upgrades on SanDisk:RBC was the first in what has become an extended streak of upgrades and positive coverage for SNDK. On February 26th, after meeting with SNDK's CFO, RBC analysts released a note saying they felt Q1 would be strong for several reasons. First, they noted oversupply concerns failed to materialize, saying this was the most important development, followed by a strong yen. Also, the analysts noted that in the long term they believe SNDK could outperform its 20-24 % target operating margin.On March 8th, Argus raised their price target for SNDK from $58 to $65. Similar to RBC, Argus focused on the supply/demand environment in NAND (something most analysts have noted), as being favorable to SNDK. Argus also concluded that SNDK's margins were subject to favorable trends for a number of reasons including NAND pricing and the depreciating yen. They also added the increased revenues derived from SSDs would be favorable for overall margins, given the product line's higher margins.Macquarie initiated coverage on SNDK with an outperform rating and a price target of $65.00 on March 12th. Like many of the analysts, Macquarie noted that near-term supply looks constrained, though they noted additional supply could begin to come online in the second half of the year. They also stressed that demand drivers, including the increasing prevalence of smartphones, remain healthy. Finally, they wrote that rising NAND prices as well as the depreciating yen should lead to gross margin expansion. Macquarie also selected SNDK as its top pick in the US memory semiconductor sector.On March 13th, Morgan Stanley followed with its own positive coverage. Morgan raised estimates to a street high $0.93 per share, a significant increase from its previous call for $0.76 per share, which was already high but much closer to consensus. The new estimates reflect what MS believes is stronger pricing thus far this quarter and a favorable supply environment. Like other analysts, Morgan Stanley noted the weaker yen as a likely cause of significant outperformance, specifically citing the weakening currency as a potential factor in outperformance for the second half of the year. As such, Morgan Stanley raised its price target from $55 to $60 per share.On March 17th, Sterne Agee raised its Q1 earnings estimates from $0.71 to $0.76 per share. Citing the same bullish catalysts as previous months' upgrades, SA also noted that spot shortages of USB-Flash cards could further contribute to the strong earnings report. Sterne Agee raised their price target from $52 to $60 per share, reflecting their increased estimates.Most recently, on April 8th, Nomura Equity Research reiterated its Buy rating on SanDisk, raising its price target from $55 to $60. Nomura cited the weakness in the yen, the transition from the low-margin memory card business to the higher-margin SSD segment, and the upcoming launch of the new iPhone, all as bullish factors for the stock. Nomura commented:Taken together, these recent analyst upgrades and Buy ratings clearly show the Street's affair with SanDisk is much more than a passing fancy. Even with the recent pullback in the indices and the weakness in the semiconductor group, SanDisk has demonstrated strong relative strength. Observe how the stock has recently broken out of its three year consolidation and appears poised to move towards $75 and perhaps beyond.SNDK 7 Year ChartSource: Yahoo! FinanceRisks:There are a number of risks regarding our thesis on SanDisk. If NAND prices were to weaken or supply constraints prove to be looser than analysts' projections or if the yen were to begin to strengthen, any of these factors would weaken our bullish outlook. Without a big earnings beat, SNDK would probably pull back to its 150-day SMA, currently at approximately $46.40. One final macro consideration: with SNDK operating in the highly cyclical semiconductor sector, if the global economy were to weaken further, premium products such as SSDs could experience a protracted decline in demand.Conclusion:While there are a number of risks to the SanDisk story, our research points to a convergence of bullish trends, which combined, could result in $6 in earnings power for 2014. Should we prove to be correct, our near-term price target over the next quarter is the mid-$60s. By the fall, as analysts raise their forward price estimates, SanDisk's P/E multiple should expand, propelling the stock to $75 and perhaps all-time highs. In summary, the stage has been set for an affair to remember for SanDisk shareholders.Disclosure: I am long SNDK. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1230251,23479,2013-02-27T14:38:31-05:00,,"Quick Take SanDisk’s (SNDK) stock has risen over 10% during 2013 so far primarily on the encouraging results it posted for Q4 2012. We think that the stock’s ascent is justified primarily due to the growth posted in the solid state drive (SSD) division, which makes up approximately 15% of the firm’s value. This division will be a key factor for future growth because SanDisk’s relationships with industry leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), anticipated reduction in SSD prices and impact of cloud storage on enterprise SSD sales will ensure that its SSD revenues grow at a rapid pace in the coming years.See our complete analysis of SanDisk hereSSDs Estimated to Be 25% of Revenues by 2014According to the company’s management, SanDisk’s SSD sales made up approximately 10% of its total revenues in 2012. Revenues more than doubled to $458 million in 2012 from approximately $198 million in 2011. Additionally, management forecasts that SSDs will make up approximately 25% of the company’s total revenues by 2014.Overall, we are encouraged to see that SanDisk was able to capitalize on a secular industry trend by more than doubling its SSD revenues. The company supplies SSDs to 10 leading PC OEMs, which should help it gain market share. We estimate that SanDisk’s market share in SSDs was approximately 4% in 2012, and we expect this figure to increase to approximately 10% by the end of our forecast period.  If these OEM relationships help SanDisk increase its market share to 20%, we would see almost 20% upside to our price estimate for SanDisk.Technology Improvements to Reduce CostsOne of the key factors holding back the wide adoption of SSDs is its high costs relative to regular hard disk drives (HDD). On average, SSDs are at least twice as expensive as regular HDDs and this cost differential is still causing price conscious customers and enterprises to prefer HDDs to SSDs.However, as memory production costs go down due to an improvement in technology, these savings will be passed on to the customers. Consequently, this will lead to a decline in the average selling price per gigabyte for SSDs, eventually minimizing cost savings that customers generate by preferring HDDs over SSDs.Cloud Storage Risk OverestimatedOne concern however is the impact that cloud storage will have on SanDisk’s SSD business given that cloud storage will reduce the need for local storage solutions. While this risk is pertinent to SanDisk’s PC SSD business, we think the overall impact on SSD revenues will be minimal.If cloud storage becomes the primary mode of storage for customers, the need for storage will shift from local PC/tablet/mobile to cloud servers. The key point is that regardless of where the data is stored, the need to store data will always exist.

Devices like mobile phones and tablets are known for having no moving parts at all - no hard drive sales there.With chip drives, called Solid State Drives or SSDs, now poised to move into the data center, because they deliver data much faster than a hard drive can, and with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) having moved to a ""hybrid"" drive - combining chips and disk - for its Macintosh line, Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) have made the smart move into making such hybrids standard.While Western Digital has just begun shipping hybrids, in 500 MB and 1 terabyte sizes - to its OEM customers, Seagate says it is committing fully to the new technology, dropping its most popular disk-only drives from the consumer line and committing fully to what it now calls Solid State Hybrid Drives or SSHDs.The question for investors is, how far can this ""can't beat 'em, better join 'em"" strategy take these companies?Fact is both are already near their peaks, in terms of price. STX is currently trading at $32.40, 17% higher than its price of a year ago. WDC, at $48 and is up 25% year-over-year.To many, it makes no long-term sense. If chip-based memory is the coming thing, why are the hard drive makers drawing a big bid? It could be high short interest - Western Digital is one of the most-shorted stocks on the street. It could also be the continuing take-over rumors around Seagate- none of which have come true.Both companies are heavily favored by institutions. Both companies draw three, four and five star ratings from major ratings groups. Samsung holds a big stake in Seagate, about 10%, and Hitachi holds a similar-sized stake in Western Digital.Still, these are products that are coming to the end of their useful life, as even their makers are admitting with this latest tweak. While Western Digital is now the 19th largest maker of SSDs, the successor technology, and Seagate is 22nd. Their best routes to growth in this sector may lie in buying one of the existing SSD players, like troubled OCZ (NASDAQ:OCZ). But even there it's hard to see a long-term future - the big memory chip players are starting to make their own drives, and would surely squeeze out such a play over time.So, with SSDs taking over, with even these two hard drive leaders admitting it with the move to hybrids, how long can they maintain these high valuations? Only as long as they can keep churning out profits. Seagate sports a 3.7% yield and a PE lower than that of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) while WDC has a lower yield but higher earnings multiple.The bottom line is that these are what I call harvesting stocks. They are harvesting profits in their technology space as that space slowly withers away. The move to hybrids is proof of how their time is passing. If you want to play here, go for the yield, but be prepared to jump at short notice.These companies are paying you to own them. When they can no longer pay, the bottom will drop out. And their latest moves show that time is coming. It's too early to recommend a short, but that time is coming.Disclosure: I am long AAPL.

1121331,23479,2013-01-18T18:06:18-05:00,,"SanDisk Corporation (SNDK), a leader in flash memory storage solutions, is set to release its Q4 2012 earnings Wednesday, January 23. The company reported revenues of $1.3 billion in Q3, which was a 10% decline year-over-year, but a 23% increase on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Overall, we think that SanDisk has positioned itself well in an industry that is struggling due to oversupply.We saw signs of NAND price stabilization in SanDisk’s Q3 earnings, and will be closely watching whether or not this trend has continued during Q4. Additionally, we will watch SanDisk’s market share in the Solid State Drive (SSD) market, because this product line will be the key to the company’s growth going forward.NAND Flash Prices StabilizingA major drag on SanDisk’s profitability over the last year has been a decline in NAND flash prices. However, the company was less affected by these declines in Q3 2012, as it reported sequential price declines of only 8% for the quarter, compared to 20% for Q2 2012. We think that this trend will continue, as large NAND flash manufacturers have kept cutting capital expenditures over the past quarter, which over the long term, should help bring stability to NAND flash prices.We are confident of this prediction because one of SanDisk’s competitors, Micron (NASDAQ:MU), reported that there was a 5% increase in the average selling price of NAND flash towards the latter part of fourth quarter. However, the company still maintains that it is difficult to forecast the future trend in prices. We will be closely watching what SanDisk’s management has to say about NAND flash prices to better understand how it fared during the quarter.SSD Will Be A Big Driver Of GrowthWe currently estimate that SanDisk’s Solid State Drive (SSD) segment makes up approximately 10% of its total value. During the company’s Q3 earnings call, management stated that the division generated close to 10% of SanDisk’s total revenues, which is a big increase from the make up in 2011, which was around 1% of total revenues.We think that this division will be a big driver of growth going forward, mainly because SSDs seem to be taking over traditional hard drives as the primary form of storage on laptops and enterprise servers. The key for SanDisk in this segment will be enterprise SSD demand, which is being fueled by the movement towards the cloud. Cloud servers need fast hard drives to locate consumer data quickly, and SSDs are the best options for enterprise servers at present. Therefore, we will be closely watching for a change in SanDisk’s market share in the SSD market during this quarter's earnings announcement. This is important, because if SanDisk is able to capture approximately 18% of the SSD market, it would cause around 10% upside to our price estimate.We currently have a $50 price estimate for SanDisk, which is approximately 8% above the current market price.See our complete analysis of SanDisk hereDisclosure: No positions."
1124591,27221,2013-01-22T11:22:27-05:00,,"SanDisk (SNDK) is one of the leaders in flash storage technology, a market that has extensive untapped potential as the computing market transitions away from PC's and laptops to tablets and other mobile devices such as smartphones. Because of this incredible growth potential, as well as the very cheap valuation of the company's shares, I believe SanDisk is worth a serious look.SanDisk's shareholders have been rewarded nicely since the 2008 lows resulting from the general panic in the market. When any company that had any weakness whatsoever was trading at a ridiculous price, SanDisk was no exception, hitting a low of $5.07, which was less than half of the net asset value at the time. Since then, shares have rebounded over 855% to the current level of $48.46 as of this writing.SanDisk focuses its efforts in three categories: mobile phones, consumer and computing. The company's microSD and Memory Stick Micro product lines are top selling removable storage devices for mobile phones, and storage demands continue to increase as video storage and downloading becomes more prevalent on smartphones. The consumer segment focuses on flash products for gaming systems, cameras, and GPS systems.The computing segment is possibly the most recognizable, with SanDisk's line of USB flash drives. Additionally, the company is developing Solid State Drives (SSDs) for the computing market. While I believe it is unlikely that SSDs will replace traditional hard disk drives in PCs and traditional laptops on a wide scale, with the trend toward tablet computing (tablets use solid state storage), ultrabooks and smartphones; demand for SSDs should grow accordingly.Combined with all of the growth potential for SSD devices, my most compelling reason to be bullish on SNDK is simple valuation. SanDisk currently trades at a relatively high 23.9 times the consensus of $2.03. The company is expected to report on Wednesday that it earned in 2012, however this valuation is more than justified. First, the same consensus estimates call for earnings to grow to $3.51 and $4.16 in 2013 and 2014, respectively, more than doubling in the next two years. So, SNDK trades at 11.6 times 2014 earnings, which sounds a lot better. To make the stock look even more attractive, SanDisk has over $15 in net cash per share, including long-term securities. When you back this out of the share price, SanDisk trades at 16.5 times current earnings and just eight times 2014's earnings, a great valuation for the amount of growth projected.So, what should investors hope SNDK should do over the next few years? The company has traded at an average multiple of 13.5 times forward earnings over the past four years. So, using the 2014 consensus (which I actually consider a bit conservative), that gives me a one-year target price of $56.16, or 15.9% upside over current levels.As my frequent readers know, my favorite way to play undervalued stocks is with conservative LEAPS spreads, so I'll suggest one here. Using the January 2014 leaps, I want to buy the $45 call for $8.75 and sell the $55 call for $4.10 for a net cost of $4.65. Maximum profit on this trade is $5.35, or 115% is achieved if SNDK is over $55 at expiration, which is less than our target price. One of my favorite aspects of this trade is that it makes money as long as SNDK is over $49.65 at expiration, just 2.5% above the current share price. Given the extreme growth potential for solid state and flash devices, I believe this trade has a very favorable risk/reward ratio that could reward an ambitious investor. If you are a bit more conservative, the $40/50 spread costs $5.85, and provides much more downside protection, making money with SNDK anywhere above $45.85.Regardless of which spread you use, or even if you simply buy shares, SanDisk investors should be handsomely rewarded as the tablet and smartphone markets grow and demand for its products explodes right along with it.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1116271,32001,2013-01-16T17:30:13-05:00,,"Although Sandisk (SNDK) will report alongside Apple after the bell on January 23rd, all eyes will be on Apple, which hopefully won't over-shadow what we expect to be a decent 4th quarter and a better 2013 for the NAND Flash and SSD producer.Analyst consensus for Q4 '12 for SNDK is expecting $0.73 in earnings per share (EPS) on $1.27 billion in revenue for year-over-year (y/y) declines of 44% and 3% respectively.Revenue and eps estimates for the 4th quarter have been stable since October.2012 was a tough year for SNDK: Gross margin declined from its peak of 43% - 44% in late 2011, to just 27% in the 2nd quarter of 2012. It was the first quarter 2012 where SNDK really got walloped on both an excess supply of NAND and weaker-than-expected demand, and subsequently issued horrid guidance for the business, which crushed the stock and drove it from $50 in early 2012 to $30 by late summer.The stock was down 10% - 12% in calendar 2012.Q3 '12 was a better quarter for SNDK as gross margin bounced back towards 10%, and higher average selling prices (ASPs) resulted in a 41% upside surprise of $0.48 per share versus the $0.34 estimate.As it stands currently, the full-year '12 is expected to generate a little over $2 per share and $5 billion in revenue for expected declines this full year of 11% and 57%.However, that is now in the rear-view mirror and SNDK faces those very easy comparisons in the first half of 2013. Here are some other bright spots for the coming year:1.) On the Q1 '12 call, despite the horrid guidance, SNDK announced they were supplying all smartphone makers as of the end of Q1 '12, which meant that finally SNDK was in the Apple supply chain. I suspect that will show up this quarter for SNDK, and they could even benefit from the low-end iPhone, should it happen;2.) Japan and the yen: a strong yen, or a 5% strengthening in the yen was thought to cost SNDK 200 bp's - 300 bp's in gross margin, as noted on a call in early 2011. In early January, '12, the dollar hit a two-year high against the yen, after Japanese Prime Minister Abe pushed for aggressive monetary easing in Japan. While the dollar strengthening/yen weakness has come in a hurry, it could help SNDK's Q4 2012, and more importantly be another tailwind in 2013.3.) SSD - A new product line for SNDK, solid state drives are now 10% of SNDK's total revenue with more growth ahead;ASP's are a big deal for SNDK's earnings growth. In a report dated October 19th, 2012, out of PiperJaffrey, the analyst noted that a 5% swing in ASP's for SNDK can impact eps 20%. Here is the history of both how growth and ASP's have evolved for SNDK since 2009:As the reader can quickly see, the pricing pressure in technology and NAND flash (and really all of semiconductors) puts a lot of pressure on profitability, so even flat pricing with volume growth can really add delta to SNDK's earnings per share, which is what we are expecting in Q4 '12 and then in early '13.The first half of 2013 should be good for SNDK. Current Q1 '13 earnings and revenue estimates are looking for $0.67 and $1.37 billion for year-over-year growth of 3% and 13%, respectively.The key is the very weak compares from the first half of 2012.According to the attached chart, the stock is up about 10% from the October '12 earnings report, and is technically not overbought on the weekly.SNDK's valuation is tricky, given the volatility around earnings. This is a stock that had a $4.78 ""forward 4-quarter eps"" estimate in October '11 following the 3rd quarter earnings report, only to see earnings get crushed 6 months later.With the weakening yen, and the SSD's not to mention SNDK now being part of the Apple supply chain, I think the stock could trade into the high $50s in the next 6 months, if we get the margin expansion.The current 2013 eps estimate of $3.51 might get revised up to $5 per share this year, with the above tailwinds. Given SNDK's history, it isn't out of the question.SNDK was probably our worst performing holding in the first half of 2012, and didn't help our performance at all. We are expecting to get some of that back in the first half of 2013.Disclosure: I am long SNDK, AAPL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

On Dec. 31, 2012, Sterne Agee reiterated a ""buy"" rating on SNDK with a $51.00 price target.Analysts, on average, are estimating an EPS of $0.73 with revenue of $1.53B for the current quarter ending in December, 2012. Analysts are also predicting an EPS of $2.03 with revenue of $5.04B for fiscal 2012. For 2013, analysts are projecting an EPS of $3.51 with revenue of $6.03B, which is 19.70% higher than 2012, as seen from the table below.Source: Yahoo FinanceKey Stats and ValuationSNDK has an enterprise value of $9.98B and a market cap of $10.91B. SNDK currently has a total cash of $2.60B and an operating cash flow of $423.78M with a levered free cash flow of -100.90M, ttm. By using the data obtained from Morningstar, SNDK's key stats can be compared to its competitors in the data storage industry, including Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU). SNDK has a higher revenue growth (3 year average) of 19.1, as compared to the industry average of 14.4. SNDK has lower operating margin of 15.5%, ttm, and net margin of 9.5%, ttm, comparing to the industry averages of 16.3% and 13.0%, ttm, respectively. SNDK has a lower ROE of 7.0, as compared to average of 19.2. SNDK has a lower debt-to-equity of 0.1, comparing to the average of 1.3.SNDK currently has a P/E of 22.9, which is higher than the industry average of 11.9 and SNDK's 5 year average of 11.7. SNDK has a forward P/E of 12.8, which is lower than S&P 500's average of 14.2. SNDK has a PEG ratio of 1.4.Technically AnalysisSNDK closed at $45.11 with 0.40% loss on Tuesday. SNDK had been trading in the range of $30.99-$53.08 in the past 52 weeks. SNDK has a beta of 1.80. The MACD (12, 26, 9) indicator had been showing a bullish sign since Nov. 28, 2012 and the MACD difference slightly diverged yesterday. The momentum indicator, RSI (14), is showing a strong momentum at 63.55. SNDK is currently trading above its 50-day MA of $42.18 and 200-day MA of $ 40.54. The next resistance is $45.96, the R1 pivot point, followed by $48.42, the R2 pivot point, as seen from the chart below.Source: StockCharts.comOptions StrategyWhile SNDK has a strong technology position, SanDisk will be affected by the commodity-like and cyclical natures of the flash memory market. Although the current P/E is higher than the industry average, the forward P/E is undervalued compared to S&P 500. For bullish investors, a credit put options strategy is reviewed for investors to acquire the SNDK's stock at a better entry price while gaining some upside potential.The maximum profit is $0.55, and the maximum risk/margin requirement is $1.45 ($2.00 loss - $0.55 credit received). If SNDK closes above $40.00 on April 20, 2013, 37.93% return on margin will be gained. If SNDK falls below $40.00 upon options expiration, SNDK's stock will be acquired at $39.45, which is 12.55% lower than the current price of $45.11.Note: All prices are quoted from the closing of January 8, 2013 and all calculations are before fees and expenses.

1069261,24105,2012-12-17T16:32:29-05:00,,"Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) are among the most unloved of the despised tech sector (justifying the ""ugly sisters"" label). The stocks are trading at ridiculously low price earnings multiples, which imply that they are on the verge of going out of business. What is interesting about these two companies is that, partly through acquisitions, they have each grown to a similar size. The two of them now dominate the hard disk drive industry, with a third smaller competitor (Toshiba) tagging along. This duopoly plus a small fry pattern seems to characterize a number of industries and, once this market structure is attained, it seems to stabilize and be hard to change. WDC and STX are similar in other ways. They both have fiscal years ending at the end of June (June 29 this past year) which makes comparisons easier. They both recently acquired a large competitor (STX acquired the hard disk drive operations of Samsung: WDC acquired the hard disk drive operations of Hitachi). In each case this greatly increased capacity and sales volume. They each have been targeting some acquisitions upstream to better control input costs.Anyhow, the table below provides per share data based on the full fiscal year ending this past June. The net cash and share count data are based on the most recent financial reports (for the quarter ending September, 2012) filed with the SEC. The other data is based on the annual reports for the fiscal year ending June 29, 2012, as filed with the SEC.WDC has elected to use cash flow to pay down debt and build up balance sheet cash while STX has been more aggressive buying back stock and paying dividends. They each have plenty of cash flow for all of these purposes so it will be interesting to see what they do with their cash in the next couple of years. STX recently bought a large competitor by issuing a lot of stock and they have already bought back more than enough stock to offset the extra issuance. STX's price earnings ratio based on the last full fiscal year is an amazing 4.1. In fairness, it is universally acknowledged that fiscal 2012 was somewhat of an anomaly because of shortages and high prices for disk drives created by idiosyncratic circumstances and that this level of earnings is not sustainable. The table below provides consensus projected total revenue and earnings per share for the two companies for the present fiscal year (the year ending June, 2013, and the fiscal year ending June, 2014 from Yahoo Finance.STX is certainly headed for a decline, but the consensus decline would still leave it trading at a little more than five times earnings. WDC is a bit larger and - because of its net balance sheet cash - actually has a lower Enterprise Value (WDC=$7.79B; STX=$10.94B). But. of course, STX has a much more generous dividend. You may hear investors debate the comparative merits of these two stocks. I think it is a silly debate and that an investor who is not so pessimistic about the sector's future prospects that he believes the low PEs are justified should just buy them both. By doing so, an investor minimizes competitive risk (the risk that WDC or STX will gain a big market share and margin advantage over the other) and can make a ""bet"" solely based on his view of whether the pricing is overly pessimistic given the prospects of the sector.So the real issue is the fate of this sub-industry. The conventional wisdom is that the industry's fate is inexorably tied to the PC and that PC's are in decline as users switch to tablets which will not need hard disk drives. So, these valuations reflect the consensus ""Short the PC!"" sentiment which is very strong in the market right now. On the other hand, there are external storage needs for hard disk drives that seem to be growing and conventional storage is still cheaper than flash memory. WDC and STX are also in the solid state drive and hybrid drive markets as well. Consensus projections do not seem to foreshadow dire financial results and the normal decline one might see in margins and prices with lower demand may not materialize due to the recent changes in market structure. It will be interesting to see how the duopoly works out. Will the companies pile up huge cash hoards in order to deter one another from aggressive price action the same way incumbent Congressman raise lots of campaign money to deter primary opposition? More importantly, will the other demands for external storage assure a relatively ""soft"" landing?In that regard, I have been hearing that the disk drive business is about to come to an ignominious and financially disastrous end for a number of years now and it appears that a number of smart investors as well as the consensus of analysts believe that a ""soft"" landing is more likely. It is sure nice not to have to count on growth in order to have one's investment thesis pay off and, with the above numbers, all you really need is a slow, rather than a fast, decline. Quarterly financial reports should be carefully analyzed for directional trends in revenue and margin and to determine each company's strategy for deploying free cash flow (share repurchases, build up of balance sheet cash, debt retirement, etc.). Based on current prices, I am long both of these. Of course, these stocks shouldn't sell for 15 times earnings, but 5 times earnings is just a little too cheap.Disclosure: I am long STX, WDC.

1035791,23479,2012-11-29T12:57:50-05:00,,"SanDisk’s (SNDK) stock has taken a hit over the past month, falling more than 10% from $45 to $40 levels currently. This downward movement has widened the gap between the market price and our $50 price estimate, undermining our valuation by approximately 25%.In our opinion, the decline in the market price is unwarranted since SanDisk is well-positioned to supply the smartphone and solid state drive (SSD) markets, both of which are expected to grow rapidly over our forecast period. Additionally, the stabilization in NAND prices, whose fall caused a year-over-year revenue decline for SanDisk during the last few quarters, will help the company grow its top-line going forward.  See our complete analysis of SanDisk hereQ3 Encouraging While SanDisk has struggled to post year-over-year growth during this calendar year, we think it is still in a strong position to deliver revenue growth in the coming years. What we found encouraging during the company’s recent quarterly results was that it posted a 23% increase in revenue on a sequential basis, creating a strong foundation for an increase going forward.Smartphone Market to Grow RapidlyOverall, we think that growth in the number of smartphones sold will be key for SanDisk. Gartner estimates that smartphone shipments grew at a rapid 46% year-over-year during the third quarter, maintaining a long run of rapid growth which is likely to continue over the next few years.What is especially encouraging is that SanDisk was able to increase its market share during the year despite operating in the highly competitive mobile flash storage industry. We think a strong brand name will help the company maintain and increase its market share in the next few years, setting it up to get a bigger share of the growing smartphone flash storage market.It is, however, worth noting that smartphone sales depend on a stable macroeconomic environment. Many emerging economies don’t have a two-year upgrade cycles as in the US, and if these economies slow, we could see a decline in overall smartphone sales.Flash Prices StabilizingOne of the key reasons that SanDisk is struggling to maintain year-over-year revenue growth is oversupply of NAND flash memory, which has heavily impacted the firm’s top-line. However, these trends seem to be changing as recent data from SanDisk and overall industry supply cuts indicate that NAND prices are stabilizing.For example,  SanDisk reported a sequential flash price decline of only 8% in Q3 compared to almost 20% in Q2. We think that these trends could continue and create upside to the Trefis price estimate. We currently expect the average selling price (ASP) per gigabyte (GB) of flash memory will fall rapidly to $0.01 by the end of our forecast period (from $0.50 now), but if flash memory prices fall only to $0.03 by 2019, we would see upside of 10% to the Trefis price estimate. You can use our tool below to assess the impact of a change in ASP per GB of flash storage on SanDisk’s value.Another key point is that SanDisk’s NAND price declines were relatively muted compared with competitor Micron (NASDAQ:MU). This is encouraging since it indicates that the company’s management has done a good job in minimizing the effect of NAND price declines. The high quality management is likely to give SanDisk a competitive edge as it fights to maintain its large presence in the flash industry.SSDs to Drive GrowthWhile the average selling price per gigabyte for SSD is much higher than that for a traditional hard drive, the drives are cheaper to run, use less power, are more reliable and compact. SSDs have another advantage in that they can process information faster and manage more operations per second compared to legacy drives. In our opinion, these factors will result in a higher demand for SSDs (especially since ASPs fall over the long term) as more enterprises shift to flash storage with cloud-based applications becoming more data-intensive.We currently have a $50 price estimate for SanDisk, which is approximately 25% above the current market price.Disclosure: No positions"
1046461,24157,2012-12-05T10:53:57-05:00,,"Contrary to public opinion, the long-term implications of cloud computing on the storage and computing businesses are very positive. Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is highly undervalued at anything below $70/share as this company stands to benefit more from cloud computing than it will suffer.Not since the United States developed a national power grid for the delivery of electricity have we seen a movement as impactful to our daily lives as cloud computing may be. The national power grid effectively opened access to electricity to the entire country. And since that time have we seen a decline in the amount of electricity consumed or the number of devices that consume electricity? Not at all. In retrospect, the national power grid removed the bottleneck of proximity to the use of electricity as it allowed people and businesses most anywhere to access electricity in almost unlimited amounts.Cloud computing does the same for the storage and analysis of data as the power grid did for electricity.As my great friend Brad Little of Capgemini explains, we should look at cloud computing services like a public utility for the cheap provision of storage and computing capacity. His analogy to the power grid resonates well as he explains the enormous benefits of the scale of centralizing cloud computing services.First, the speed and cheapness of getting data storage and computing capacity from the major cloud providers makes building one's own impractical. Armed with a credit card and a few minutes, businesses can add unheard of levels of data storage and computing capacity. That beats the pants off the time and resources required to procure, build out and manage one's own data center.The biggest myth about cloud providers is the lack of security compared to managing one's own data. That's like saying that Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) has worse security in its stores than most have in their homes. In reality, the cloud providers have the best, most cutting edge security because the scale of their operations allows them to (1) afford the best security, (2) gain more experience and expertise with security issues and (3) make security a major priority because it is core to their business.In other words, cloud providers can offer businesses more security than they can afford on their own.Figure 1: Return On Invested Capital Averages 38% Since 2004Sources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsSo, what does this mean for Western Digital's business? It means that cloud services will unlock currently unforeseen demand for data storage and computing. By making the storage so cheap and the computing speeds so fast while also providing best-in-market security, cloud services open a brave new world in data and analytics.Currently, most businesses have more data than they know what to do with. Most businesses are only scratching the surface of the analytical potential of all the data that enterprise software solutions like SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) provide. The more businesses learn how to use their data, the more analytics they will apply, the results of which produce more data, which, in turn, will be analyzed. And the cycle continues.That means the demand for storage and computing capacity will grow, not decline, in the future. And WDC is well-positioned to benefit from that growth. With a top-quintile return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) in 2012 at 40%, WDC is one of the most profitable businesses in its industry. Only Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) at 44.5% and Synaptics (NASDAQ:SYNA) at 42% have higher ROICs. A high ROIC means that WDC is positioned to turn growth into profits at a high rate. It also means the business is managed intelligently, has an impressive ability to innovate and a focus on shareholder value creation. From an operational perspective, it is hard to ask for much more.ValuationThe valuation of WDC is also compelling.First, I want to point out that putting data and computing power in the cloud does not obviate the need for storage and computing capacity. It only moves it from a fragmented customer base to a more concentrated customer base, namely the cloud service providers.Concentration of the customer base is going to hurt WDC's margins, no doubt, as large-scale buyers demand lower prices than smaller scale buyers such as consumers or small businesses.Consequently, I do not expect WDC's ROIC to remain at 40%, but neither does stock price. Indeed, WDC's current valuation (~$34/ share) implies its ROIC will drop from 40% to 12% and never rise from that level. In terms of after-tax cash flows (NOPAT), the current stock price implies they will permanently decline by 70%. Essentially, the market price suggests that WDC will just about go out of business.Market expectations are unduly pessimistic. The stock is too cheap.Figure 2 plots a comparison of the WDC stock to its economic book value (EBV), which is currently $105/share. The current EBV is the value of the stock if its NOPAT never grows beyond its 2012 level. I'd say that is a rather healthy margin of safety.Figure 2: WDC Is Trading at a 70% Discount To Its No-Growth ValueSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsWDC gets my Attractive rating because of its rising profitability and cheap valuation. The risk/reward of this stock is also compelling because of its 2.2% dividend.Relevant ETFs and Mutual FundsMy regular readers know that I also cover 400+ ETFs and 7000+ mutual funds, and I like to point out the ETFs and mutual funds that allocate most to the stocks I recommend to buy or sell.For WDC, there are only two mutual funds (and zero ETFs) that allocate significantly to WDC and get an Attractive or better rating: (1) Aston Funds: ASTON/Cornerstone Large Cap Value Fund (OTCPK:AVIX) and (MUTF:RVALX) and (2) Oak Associates Funds: Red Oak Technology Select Fund (MUTF:ROGSX).

991541,32101,2012-11-08T15:12:14-05:00,,"Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) reported another good earnings release last week -- yet the shares still trade at the pessimistically valued PE of 4.79. It is clear that a significant portion of the market still suspects that Western Digital's future will not be as bright as its recent past.The Near Term Future And The Long Term FutureIt is true, unfortunately, that Western Digital's margins are bound to decline. As I first noted in my article on August 30th, 2012, since the 1980's the hard disc drive (""HDD"") industry has developed with a two year product cycles. This gives the industry a two year trend of rising and falling gross profit margins. This can be roughly seen below:WDC Profit Margin Quarterly data by YChartsSo here we are, at the top of such a cycle. Of course, the cycle has been sufficiently disrupted from any normal course due to last year's flooding in Thailand. Further, ASPs have generally been on a decline and the major disruptions of the supply chain have caused ASPs to increase to levels not seen since 2004:(Source: Western Digital's 10-Q, dated September 2012, p. 22)The ASP above of $62 can be assumed to decline in the long run, back first to 2011 levels, and eventually below.Therefore, in the near term, we can expect a continue boon for the industry -- which has basically been consolidated between Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital. (See my article on Western Digital's side of the duopoly here, and my article on Seagate's side here.)In the long-term, we can expect ASPs to decline. Also, in the long-run, we can expect increased competition from advances in solid state drives. But for now, however, solid state drives (""SSD"") don't appear to be fully cost efficient for the average user (more comments on this below).Further, and as noted in the operating results above, Western Digital's sales mix has gone increasingly to 'enterprise' -- which can be taken to mean servers and cloud. As the media reiterate to us, those are considered the growth areas of tech.ValuationWestern Digital -- and its rival Seagate -- are still undervalued by the market. There has been, I believe, undue pessimism on the future of HDD's generally -- which, coincidentally, means and undue optimism on SSDs. The optimism, in my opinion, is because some believe that consumers move continuously toward the ""technologically perfect."" But it seems to this author that economics and human purchases move rather towards the ""economically perfect."" That is, SSDs are too expensive and the added functionality, at least for now, is not worth the additional cost to many average users.Let us take a look at Western Digital's free-cash-flow [1]:WDC Free Cash Flow TTM data by YChartsOne can see the monstrous climb in free-cash-flow, from under $1 billion at the end of 2011, to over $2.76 billion in the last 12 months. That huge FCF equates, as one can see above, to a staggering FCF yield of a 30.9%. All this extra cash means, of course, that Western Digital is able to do things with it. For instance, for the first quarter they repurchased shares -- which, given that the shares are undervalued, will have a multiplying effect on intrinsic value per share:(Source: Western Digital 10-Q, dated September 2012, p. 6)ConclusionWith such a deeply undervalued stock, when compared to its current cash flow generating abilities, one has to believe that others really do not see a continuously bright future for Western Digital. To that, we agree. But, we think, the degrees with which it will be less good, will still represent a satisfactory return. For instance, if free-cash-flow dropped by half, the yield would be 15% at today's prices -- which, of course, is still an attractive yield.The future will not be as bright as the past 12 month period, but it will not be as bad as current share prices suggest. Western Digital, after all, is the biggest player and is one half of the HDD duopoly.Notes:Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

939351,24178,2012-10-22T15:34:13-04:00,,"Shares of Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) were sold for investors accounts on August 13th, 2012 at $44. As of close of market on Friday Oct. 19th, the shares were being traded for a mere 34.88. A decline of a full $9.12 or almost 21% in barely 9 weeks. Is the value of the company really less than it was, when the shares recently traded at $44?Recently the opportunity to go traveling presented itself again, and couldn't be passed up. This time, the trip would include Switzerland and parts of Italy. For a change the cell phone camera was left behind in favor of a new Canon (NYSE:CAJ) T4i. Canon is a remarkable company that produces remarkable products and that incidentally (its stock) is also on sale. This device, like so many others generated exponentially more data / media than its predecessor. There was a sense of guilt splurging on a new camera, but after returning triple digits to investors for some time, perhaps it could be forgiven (especially since no fee or commission had ever been charged, although the profits for this handful of individual investors had already climbed into the millions).Human nature can be curious. When Amvona was building its photo equipment and online business, great care was taken to keep everything confidential - despite this the ideas were often copied and the strategies that Amvona pioneered in those days can still be found on in other businesses large and small to this day.When Amvona was resurrected as a site that publishes (amongst other things) securities analysis as a means to discern sound investments virtually all of the ideas (that time permitted) were published and made freely available to the public. More than two years later, and despite consistent triple digit returns, hardly anyone seemed to notice or care. Even intelligent businessmen, with under-performing portfolios, but who are otherwise successful have turned down help (offered entirely for free), and although an abundance of evidence exists, cast doubt on the entire operation. From this a great lesson regarding human nature (and parenthetically) the markets has been learned - that is, you can show people to the truth (supported by all the data and evidence in the world), and often it is still rejected, particularly if it threatens an existing world view.Getting back to the T4i - it's a whole new camera, the 18 Megapixel CMOS sensor is incredible, as its the ability to shoot multiple images at great speed - when this is paired to the radically faster i/o speeds of the latest flash cards a new meaning arises from the term ""data storage.""Upon returning home it seemed there must be over a thousand (high res.) images on that tiny card. When the images were transferred to the hard drive on the desktop there were actually over 2200 (representing 12 days of travel).Is there a misunderstanding?Generally it seems the market feels that somehow SSD's will replace HDD's. This is not correct, at least for the time being. They are at the very least complimentary - indeed the more high capacity, high speed SSD's which come into existence, the greater the need for HDD's. SSD's are temporal storage for data that is intended to remain in perpetuity, but if this media is to be truly ""stored"", it will be for the foreseeable future on mechanical hard drives. However it is not enough to recognize the complimentary nature of SSD's and HDD's, but also to understand the long term changing dynamics of data storage and retrieval, particularly as it relates to three concepts:1. The creation and growth of Cold Storage (e.g. Amazon Glacier)2. The long tail of data storage (mathematical eventualities)3. The potential in data which is not yet stored.One type of media storage is dying, it is called ""Tape,"" and it will be widely replaced for archival storage purposes, but not by SSD's which are altogether unnecessary for such an application. HDD's have a much lower cost per GB than tape, yet much faster access times. Therefore, drives specifically designed for this purpose, needless to say, have the potential to capture ""Exabytes"" of existing market share from tape.Jay Parikh, VP of infrastructure engineering at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) recently made comments which appear to support the HDD over Tape thesis, although his comments were subtle, and difficult to interpret given how he delicately circumvents the issue, nonetheless they appear to mean that HDD's might well be preferable in next compute challenge - to quote:Even if the message is not clear, one thing is certain, in order to avoid a potential medical emergency Jay ought to avoid Chinese food at all costs.People scoff. The hard disk as we know it is ""old school,"" and it's death has been predicted for a long time. SSD's are cool, small fast, etc., companies that make them even have cool names like ""SanDisk"" (SNDK), companies that don't have boring names like ""Western Digital"" which sounds like it's from the transistor era (It is). However, the market may be misunderstanding the relationship of the two.For example many types of engines have emerged since the dawn of powered flight, the progress is astonishing. However, the basic shape of an airfoil (the very thing which produces lift) has not changed nearly as much, nor the idea of how to control the air which flows over its surface (what the Wright brothers initially called ""wing warping"" and later became ""ailerons""). The basic function of lift and control some hundred years later is still intact. The hard drive is somewhat newer, and although greatly improved, the basic concept is still intact because it works.For this reason, even exciting new companies, with far greater premiums on their market price, are endeavoring to find new ways to work with the HDD - for example, Prinevile, Oregon (amongst other towns) will soon have close to one million sq. feet of cold storage space dedicated to the HDD as indicated in the following:To be clear the reference is to a ""hard-disk storage server,"" not an SSD storage server.Facebook even after its epic stock price decline still trades at a P/E ratio of 65 and a P/B ratio of 3.05. With the above article it is evident that at least part of the billions raised from the victims of the FB IPO will be used to build large storage facilities for Hard Drives - and even though the storage may be in a way ""free"" to the end user, the drives are not free to FB or any other operator endeavor to build such a facility - of which there are many.There was one other part of the article that seemed to have at least minor importance, namely:It is interesting to consider what might happen if an article or two was published that spoke of millions of square feet of storage space being built to house SSD's, and that companies building these facilities were going to require two back-up copies of everything (on SSD's of course) - and in fact that whole new types of servers would be built specifically for these SSD's - what would happen to companies such as SanDisk and their stock price (which is already trading at roughly 3x the forward P/E of WDC, although WDC is more profitable)?The market appears to like what is ""technologically exciting"" much more than what is ""financially exciting"" (WDC has better margins that SNDK for instance), even though few probably appreciate just how sophisticated these devices are. According to Pantelis Alexopoulos, executive the director of Singapore's Data Storage Institute:Boeing 747s are still being produced with hundred year old technology (see above). That having been said, even modern jets have more than two primary suppliers - the same cannot be said of HDD's.Although it might at first seem a bit of a revelation, apparently there is over 4 times more content created than is actually stored on digital media. According to WDC, capturing only 5% of this ""unstored data"" would equal all of the Exabytes shipped on enterprise disk and tape combined (See Driving Datacenter Change: Storage Opportunities in the Cloud [Mike Cordano September 13th, 2012] )It is worth contemplating if perhaps the greatest market opportunities (not to be confused with rate of growth) in storage are not in the smallest and fastest (e.g. PCIe solutions - High performance SSD / NVM, etc.), but rather these so called ""Cold Storage"" Solutions with their commensurate low cost per TB and TCO advantages. That having been said, it seems also more than likely that WDC will pursue both ends of the spectrum aggressively although they are not equal.It does not take much calculus to understand that the faster a high performance memory card functions, the greater the number of low end drives are ultimately needed. The relationship is hardly adversarial, in fact it is more than complimentary, it could even be said that the high performance SSD card ""needs"" the HDD for its very existence. In other words, there would be limits on its speed, if there were nowhere to store all of the media over the long term at a very low cost. This is a significant and fundamental paradigm shift in the very nature of how data is stored and utilized.Even if images from a family trip to Europe are just of average quality, they will still be viewed many times on Facebook or other photo sharing sites - but not for very long. After a matter of days, they will be all but forgotten in the online world that has become our collective consciousness. That is to say, content on social media sites is characterized by high media access when it is at first new, then dramatically lower accesses as it ages even slightly. This is the very nature of the new world we live in, content may have great breadth and even depth, but at once is met by the short attention span of a changing society. However, the HDD's the media is ultimately stored on (unlike the SSD it is created on) will never be completely idle, because the content remains, and must be available at any time for access.It is good if a technology company makes its first priority financial performance. Many technology companies with brilliant ideas have failed because there is a certain romance, even seduction to pure technology, it burns in the mind of the true technologist - like true innovators, these folks struggle to build successful enterprises. However, WDC is not run by a true technologist (although they employ thousands), they are run by guys interested first and foremost in sound management and superior capital allocation - and to that end, there is no management team greater in technology or otherwise.Consider for a moment the fact that both FCF and GM% over the last ten years have increased in tandem, despite intermittent declines (as the current instance) in the price of the shares. In fact, prior to the HGST acquisition WDC's gross margins averaged 18-23%, however the company now projects margins in the range of 27-32%, an increase of about 50%. The earrings announcements and guides provided since March (when the transaction closed), seem to prove the new altered, and higher margin business model. Given that OPEX, CAPEX and the Tax Rate are set to remain about the same, it seems WDC has entered a new phase of profitability.How does he know?WDC indicated at their September 13, 2012 investor conference that the company expected the TAM to be 140 M units - so it is not correct to say that this is what ""Analyst Joe Yoo thinks"" but more correctly, this is what ""Analyst Joe Yoo learned."" And it is not that they ""could"" but rather, that they ""will"" ship ~140 M units.With the formalities out of the way, it is curious how Joe Yoo could possibly know that ""Windows 8 will 'largely be a non-event…' ""If he is correct, then it can be inferred that Mr. Yoo is in fact more insightful and perhaps intelligent than a plenitude of CEOs who have invested heavily in the success of Windows 8. It's possible he is. However if one often changes opinions, engages in sudden upgrades and downgrades, and generally appears to go with the prevailing ""spirit of the times"" there are possibilities other than intelligence and the gift of foresight.It is always possible that one fears moving against the crowd, and prefers the comfort found in numbers - in the multitude. However, is it not always the crowd who lose on Wall Street? When in the history of the stock exchanges did the majority win? Wealth could not be created for the few if this were to occur. It is easy to say ""the PC is dead"" or ""Windows 8 is no good"" - after all who is not doing that? It is hard to actually critically analyze companies and historical performance - and to ask the opposite question in the later instance - who is doing that?Microsoft has never enjoyed the popularity in the minds of consumers that say Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Krispy Kreme Donuts (KKD) has. Despite this by every financial metric, it is a force to be reckoned with.A few questions were raised about the opinion of analysts in the Amvona Article Silver Platters, Annie Oakley and ""The Sidelines"" published on May 1st, 2012. It is hard to find websites that accurately track the wisdom of analyst opinions - this must be by design, so going back and reading the above article was enlightening, because it kept the temporal nature of these sort of comments in a historical perspective.At the time the article was published back in May the concern was over the future of HDD pricing and its supposed erosion - which did not materialize. Now the thesis seems more difficult to prophesy - the outcome of Windows 8, even before it launches.As late as May 9th, Citi had a ""buy"" rating on the shares of WDC. In the five months that followed the delta in Price Target issues by the firm have equated to around 10 B in value - or more (by about 20%) than the market cap. of the whole company as of the writing of this article.The Amvona earnings FQ1 13 estimate for the record is between $2.85 and $2.95 per share (unlike previous articles, it's a rough back of the envelope estimated) - while acknowledging the possibility that the company could miss even on consensus ($2.45-2.55) - it is not acknowledged or accepted that the company should thus be rated a sell. Also if forced to bet, it seems reasonable that Windows 8 will do just fine.If speculating on the success or failure of Win8 is not enough, hiding in plain sight is this fact:According to the company the Total Addressable Market (TAM) is set to decline by roughly 10.8% in the current quarter but the related revenue only by about half as much.According to Wolfgang Nickl, CFO Western Digital:The word ""assume"" is interesting in the context of market share. It is used often through the investor presentation when references are used to market share. The question is what prevents the company from taking further market share? Visits to retailers have affirmed to incredibly important points regarding WDC's consumer business:1. The Company has more shelf-space than the competition.2. The Company's products have a superior look and feel (presentation)3. The Company appears to have far greater pricing power.Further with regards to the share repo:These guys are smart. In the prior quarter (Q4 F12) they spent about 600 M on share repurchases, that is to say when the shares were often in the low 30's. However in the current quarter, when the shares were often above 40, they spent a mere 150 M. Now the shares are back in the early 30's, and one has to wonder how busy the company's broker is. The company claims the share repurchases are ""linear."" If so, this is the finest ""linear"" repurchasing ever, because it synchronizes beautifully with the company's stock price performance (which has been anything but linear) - and unlike so many other public companies with share repo's, the company is actually buying at highly favorable prices, which is extremely beneficial to ongoing owners, who benefit every time the share price goes down.And on the Dividend:The fact that WDC presently has the ability / authorization to take back 25% of the entire concern should be startling to sellers of the stock because it could mean the company might be taken private or be acquired.If neither of the above happened, the dividend will attract dividend investors and funds focused only on companies that pay a dividend (i.e. the stock is now attractive to both value-oriented and income / dividend investors). These facts, along with the realization that the HDD is already decoupled from the traditional PC food chain, may well be the catalyst that releases the share price to more normal valuation ratios.Continue to Part 2Disclosure: I am long WDC.

It reported revenues of $1.54 billion, a 2% decline on a year-over-year basis, but a 21% increase on a sequential basis. [1] Looking at these results, we think that the company did a good job to position itself for growth in 2013. Particularly, we are encouraged by the progress the firm made with its SSD segment, which again made up 10% of total revenues during the quarter. We think that the SSD division will be a big driver of growth going forward, and management expects revenues from this segment to hit 25% of total revenues by 2014.See our full analysis on SanDiskSSD’s Estimated to Be 25% of Revenues by 2014At present, SanDisk’s SSD sales make up approximately 10% of the company’s total revenues. We are encouraged to see that SanDisk was able to capitalize on a secular trend in this industry. The company now supplies SSD’s to 10 leading PC OEM’s which should drive SanDisk’s revenues even if PC sales decline. These new partnerships with OEM’s should help the company establish an even stronger foothold in a growing industry, which will ensure that SanDisk’s SSD revenues continue to grow rapidly.Yen Weakness Will Help 2013 Gross MarginsSanDisk reported solid gross margin growth during the quarter. The metric improved t0 40% from 30% quarter-over-quarter. The increase was driven by the improvement in cost of sales and an improvement in average selling prices. However, it is worth noting that the company’s Yen exchange rate in its cost of sales was approximately 79 JPY per dollar and the Yen has fallen since to around 90 JPY per dollar.SanDisk’s Yen based wafer purchases are reflected in cost of sales with approximately a 3-month lag. This means that its gross margins will be helped by continued Yen weakness for at least the next two to three quarters. If the Yen stays at these levels for the whole year, we can expect significant improvement in the firm’s gross margins year-over-year in 2013.Quarter-on-Quarter improvement in ASPIn our pre-earnings article we stated that we would be closely watching SanDisk’s NAND flash prices during the earnings announcement. The company surprisingly reported a sequential ASP improvement during the third quarter, which shows stabilization and a possible improvement in the NAND flash industry pricing as a whole. The company reported a sequential price increase of 7% in Q4. While ASP’s for the whole year fell 35%, the figure was still lower than the 45% decline SanDisk experienced in 2011. SanDisk’s ASP’s have improved in the latter part of the year, and we think that it points to an improving demand/supply mix in the NAND flash industry.Additionally, the fact that SanDisk’s ASP’s improved when compared with competitor Micron (NASDAQ:MU), signals that the company’s management has done a good job in positioning the company to take advantage of industry trends. This proactive management should help the company time volume increases and decreases a bit better than competitors, which could possibly lead SanDisk to outperform in a highly competitive industry.We currently have a $50 price estimate for SanDisk, which is approximately 10% above the current market price.Notes:Disclsosure: No positions"
978971,30951,2012-11-05T13:56:25-05:00,,"BackgroundIt was only just over a year ago that the two hard disk giants, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) were competing in what was essentially a cutthroat, low margin business. A quick look ate two firms' gross margin profiles up to right before the Thailand floods indicates that things just weren't doing all that great:STX Gross Profit Margin Quarterly data by YChartsHowever, after the shortage caused by the Thailand floods, ASPs for hard disk drives skyrocketed to well over 50% higher than pre-flood levels. Since then, prices have come down from their sugar high, but as the chart above indicates, the gross margin profiles for these companies still remains healthier than before. Given that there are only two major hard disk drive companies (the third, Toshiba, holds 13% market share), there is very little competitive pressure from other hard disk drive manufacturers to drop prices significantly.As a result, Western Digital and its rival, Seagate, have been printing money for their shareholders over the last year.Earnings Results - Latest Quarter And GuidanceA quick look at Western Digital's latest earnings report reflects the notion of across the board ASP increases on its drives. Revenues in the latest quarter came in at $4B, or up 50% year-over-year. Earnings per share was a staggering $2.36, beating consensus by $0.04.The more interesting part of the report, however, is that the company guided for $3.55B - $3.7B in sales and EPS of $1.65 - $1.85, missing consensus estimates of $4.13B revenues and $2.43 EPS. As a result, shares of the company's stock plummeted in the after-hours session to about $33 per share before rebounding over the next couple of days right back to the $35 level.The price action can be explained fairly simply - Western Digital's valuation is just so cheap at ~4x earnings ex-cash that it is very difficult for traders to really hammer down the price before the value investors start loading up on shares. Unless this valuation metric is fundamentally disrupted by several quarters of declining earnings, the company's shares still remain an excellent value.The Solid State ThreatWhile companies such as Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and OCZ Technology Group (NASDAQ:OCZ) are leading the way with blazingly fast pure solid state drive solutions, it seems that consumers still want to have quite a bit of local storage at their disposal. That being said, the speed advantages to flash solutions cannot be ignored. This has for some - and will eventually for the majority - led to three major paradigms in client-side storage:In each of these cases, bulk storage is still very much required. The overall volume of data to be stored is increasing and for mass storage hard-disk drives are required, even if they are pushed off into the datacenter/cloud and out of the client side. The net effect here seems to be a parallel growth of both solid state solutions and hard-disk drives in the long term (albeit the solid state growth will likely be faster).Dividend/Shareholder FriendlinessWestern Digital has historically not been as shareholder friendly as its rival, Seagate, as shown here:WDC Shares Outstanding data by YChartsSTX Dividend Yield data by YChartsHowever, Western Digital finally authorized a share buyback to the tune of $1.5B and initiated a dividend, both with the intention to give 50% of free-cash-flow to investors. At 2.8% yield, the dividend isn't as attractive as Seagate's, but Western Digital balance sheet is cleaner with $3.54B in cash and $2.13B in debt against its rival's $2.37B in cash and $2.87B in debt.ConclusionWestern Digital is a well run company that pays a decent dividend, has a strong balance sheet, generates a lot of cash, and trades at bargain-bin multiples. The strategy that has made investors a lot of money has been to buy any large dips. That strategy is still sound in general on the hard disk makers.Both Western Digital and Seagate are good, with the choice depending solely on your investment tastes. Want a big dividend and more aggressive buybacks? Go with Seagate. Want the better balance sheet and higher market share drive maker? Go with Western Digital. Either way, you can't go wrong on a dip.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in WDC over the next 72 hours.

935941,34101,2012-10-19T15:12:14-04:00,,"SanDisk (SNDK), one of the leading NAND flash memory makers, will gain from the recent price increase of multilevel cell, or MLC, NAND flash memory witnessed in the first half of October. The trend will continue until November, as the demand will peak during the holiday season.While releasing its third-quarter results yesterday, the company indicated that it has benefited from the retail business and gained market share from all geographies in the world. Although the company's gross margin and operating margin slipped year over year, it has gained sequentially due to higher price realization. This has resulted in EPS topping estimates by 15 cents, or 45.5%, at 48 cents. Similarly, revenues of $1.27 billion came in above analysts' expectations of $1.22 billion.Figures taken from SanDisk.The above table indicates the pricing pressure during the first two quarters. Even in the third quarter, gross margin is yet to reach the first-quarter level. However, the sequential improvement in margin has allowed SanDisk to expect a slightly higher gross margin of 33% in the fourth quarter. The company is expecting revenue of $1.5 billion for the fourth quarter. However, analysts seem to think that the revenue outlook is conservative and that SanDisk can see much more demand from the iPhone as well as future products, such as Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad Mini and the Surface tablets from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Analysts predict revenue of $1.5 billion.After Toshiba and Samsung cut their NAND flash memory production, prices have stabilized initially and then advanced in September. In October, MLC NAND flash price has witnessed an increase of 3%-17%, according to DRAMeXchange. As the replenishment preparation work begins, OEM orders from the makers of smartphone, ultrabook, and tablet PC clients would be concentrated around September. This will make NAND flash vendors prioritize and allocate capacity for system products, for which the demand is higher.Industry observers attribute the increase in NAND flash price to clients preferring to restock inventory in September and October as a sequel to the spate of new product launches. This trend will remain in place until the middle of November. Thereafter, pricing could face pressure and could possibly see a downside for a while, TrendForce predicts. Any further increase in NAND flash depends on how the market reacts to the upcoming launches of Microsoft's Surface tablet PC and sale trends of the smartphones during the Christmas holiday season. Aside from this, the extent of replenishment demand before the Chinese New Year holiday would also dictate the pricing trend to follow.Meanwhile, S&P Capital IQ equity analyst Angelo Zino commented:Interestingly, revenues from the flash memory are estimated to fall 4.5% to $24.3 billion in 2012, from $25.5 billion in the last year, due to weakness that prevailed until July. However, the market will come back to growth trajectory in 2013 with 11.4% estimated growth, according to IHS. It will continue to expand to reach $33.3 billion by 2016. This is a 5.3% compound annual growth rate.While there are some headwinds -- such as smartphone sales and tablet PC performance -- that will dictate the NAND flash market, the current conditions favor SanDisk to deliver favorable results.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

939361,24178,2012-10-22T15:34:18-04:00,,"Go back to Part 1The Amvona (NASDAQ:WDC) EPS estimate could be wrong, the market may continue it's recent trend down - but if the market comes to understand the error of its ways, the price of WDC may well go up, for even a doubling of the share price would leave the stock cheap by all measures including the company's own historical values.Consider the valuation ratios in historical context:Another way to look at it is to say if the company just earns consensus of $2.55 per share, at Sept. 30th, 2012 the company would have had approximately $33.72 in book value (or a P/B ratio of just 1.03). A P/B book of ~1 means the company as a going concerns is, well, worthless or no more than the sum of its equity, the vast majority of which is tangible. However, since more than three weeks will have passed by the time investors learn of the company's FQ1 performance, it is almost certain that the actual P/B ratio on Oct. 22nd will be something below 1.That would mean the company is selling at just 33% of its historical 10 year avg. P/B value 3.11.Taking another look at a DCF model, if EPS is $10 (per the company) and the growth rate is 16.6% (the historical average), with a terminal growth rate of just 4% (10 years) and a standard discount rate of 12%, it is possible to reach a DCF fair value of as high as ~$227. It seems high. However, in 2009 when Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) was trading at $92 per share it also seemed expensive.The price at Friday October 19th was 34.88 per share or 15.3% of the above DCF value. Meaning it is possible that there is an 85% margin of safety at the Friday closing price.The PC is deadIt's hard to say, but isn't it just as reasonable to think (and contrary to Citi's report) that Windows 8 may well be ""a big event?"" Apple for instance is a great company, they've fought like a golden gloves champ, but virtually every other hardware and software vendor in the known universe is in the other corner, and they don't look happy. If handicapping the odds that all other giants (many of whom are collaborating) will stumble, at least consider the math, if not the fact AAPL is down one team member, which everyone seems to agree was of utmost importance - with the last product he worked on just recently being launched (the iPhone 5).Is the PC dead as Barron's seemed to recently proclaim?A title to the article claiming ""Steve Jobs is Dead"" (God rest is Soul) would not have been popular, although much more accurate and easier to verify, and perhaps also impacts the dynamics at hand. After all he was a brilliant visionary, for which there is no adequate substitute.Consider the excellent point made by ""the science of hitting"":The combined effect is about 1.3 BillionOn March 23rd of this year, the following was written in the article ""Wait! That was our price target and other musings on Memory and storage""Most of the points made in the February 24th, 2012 investor letter and published in the related article on March 23rd, 2012 have come to pass. The insurance payments were not received in Q2 as anticipated, but it seems likely they will be in Q3. It will be known shortly if the price reacts to the launch of Windows 8 above, but the impact of the mediation award being thrown out cannot be overstated. The affect is not merely 650 M, but rather 1.3 B - it is the 650 M WDC did not lose, and the 650 M STX did not gain. 1.3 B is roughly 17% of WDC's enterprise value as of the writing of this article. The news of the judges decision, unlike the updated Citi rating, was late to make it to the news, in fact it hardly appeared anywhere, much like Deutsche Bank's upgrade to a $60 Price Target on the shares just weeks before Citi's downgrade to $32.Thoughts on the earnings recordEarnings consistency: It's huge. WDC has it. STX not as much. The average earnings coefficient over past time is irrelevant if the company's performance is inconsistent: True Religion Apparel (NASDAQ:TRLG) is a great example of consistent earnings over time. Here is a chart illustrating the point.Although the company did not and still does not have the characteristics of a traditional value investment, the remarkable consistency in the earnings reports warranted careful evaluation, particularly in light of the ""relative"" value, by which Standard TRLG was by far the cheapest in it's group. For this reason, the shares were acquired on September 4th, 2012 at $22.79 per share and again on October 2nd and 3rd at $20.74 per share and $20.68 per share respectively.On October 10th, only seven days after the last shares were acquired, they were sold in the pre-market at $26.16 per share. The results outperformed the S & P 500 just slightly as can be seen below:Companies with such characteristics are good ""buy out"" candidates, is the case with TRLG the company recently announced the possibility of just such an event.TRLG was the fourth company invested in (with three out of the four discussed at length in Amvona articles), to be either bought out or taken private in the last few years (the other three being (NYSE:AM-OLD), (NASDAQ:WINN) and (NASDAQ:FRPT).The WDC investor presentation features 10 full years. Operating history - the equivalent STX presentation only 5 - STX investors might find it worthwhile to investigate why. Further the recent earnings record appears more substantial for STX, because the company was not as impaired as WDC after the Thai floods - a temporary condition. As these impaired quarters move out of the TTM figures, the P/E ratio on a TTM basis will decline (assuming the share price remains low).Consider, at the investor conference in late September WDC basically knew the Q1 FY13 numbers - when they affirmed a high guidance ($10 per share), they must have felt confident - if FQ1 was already looking hairy, they would not have felt confident, they could have alternatively withdrew or lowered their guidance as many companies do. Because the company is historically conservative, this should say everything. The analysts, the investors, they didn't and don't know the figures for FQ1, but the company itself had barely two weeks of operations left before closing the books - and they guided at $10 a share, a conviction so high, the company moved forward with additional share repurchases and initiated a divided. Decoupling - WDC may finally break free of the market perception about what exactly the PC food chain is - if this happens, and the old way of thinking changes, then the stock may emerge at more normal ratios comparable with other well run, established technology companies - this could easily mean a doubling or tripling of the stock price.However the forward P/E, even at the current level is deceptive - the present showing of 4.1 is based on analysts earnings estimates of about $8.50 per share, but if the company's estimates of $10 per share are to be believed (which the company affirmed in September), the forward P/E ratio would not be 4.1 but rather 3.48.If enterprise value is used (instead of market cap) as would be the perspective of a potential acquirer, then the ratio of enterprise value (~$31.71) to earnings at $10 per share (call it EV/E) is a mere 3.17 - this of course is based on a share count of 245 M outstanding as of the end of FY 12. However, it is already known that the company is buying shares back aggressively, so feel free to round the EV/E down to a nice even 3.Of course FCF might be even more important to a prospective acquirer, and in the TTM that figure was about $9.33 a share. However in that $9.33 per share there exists (in addition to the impaired quarters) a mere 4.5 months of HGST cash flow in the total, when 4.5 months becomes a full 12 months, it's not hard to see where the FCF figure on a per share basis would be much higher. Surely a prospective acquirer, just as an enterprising value-oriented investor would be most interested in this ""EV/FCF"" ratio - after all it's where the ""meat and potatoes"" is at. If FCF on a full year basis with HGST's earnings power is considered it not hard to see $12 per share or a EV/FCF ratio of only ~2.6. That means the company could potentially generate enough cash to effectively pay for itself (EV being the actual company price tag) in only 2.6 years.To recap, an argument could be made that more data is stored on WDC drives than any other form of media in existence and the data to be stored in the future is growing exponentially. WDC is a forty year old company that is extremely well run and hugely profitable.Even Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), which presently appears to be a good candidate for bankruptcy sells at a significant premium to WDC. After looking high and low it's hard to find a cheaper listing, if even basic criteria are used (like not operating at a deficit).In the end it doesn't matter whose EPS figures are right, or if Win8 succeeds or fails - what matters is that sooner or later the market will realize that the entire hardware ecosystem has changed. The Open Compute Project for instance effects servers, storage and the datacenter, and at the heart of this movement is the Boeing 747 of the hardware universe - the HDD as low cost building block storage.Disclosure: I am long WDC.

935601,27691,2012-10-19T12:59:15-04:00,,"Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), the world's largest hard drive manufacturer, was recently downgraded by an analyst at Citi along with competitor Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX). The main reason cited for this downgrade is the deterioration of the PC market. Of course, a drop in demand for PCs will have a negative effect on Western Digital's profits, but the stock is so undervalued that it doesn't really matter. And with earnings coming up, the put option premiums for Western Digital have become quite lucrative. This could allow you to pick up shares at a great price and get paid handsomely to do so.Quick ValuationWestern Digital currently trades for $35.55. On the balance sheet the company has about $4 in excess cash per diluted share. The free cash flow for fiscal 2012, which ended in June, was $2,350 on revenue of $12,478. In March of 2012 Western Digital closed a deal to buy Hitachi, effectively making it the largest hard drive manufacturer in the world. Since this took place well into fiscal 2012 the full effect of the merger isn't represented in the fiscal 2012 results. But even using these figures, WD had a FCF/share of $9.59. This puts the effective P/FCF, after backing out cash, at about 3.3.So even if profitability decreases due to lagging PC demand, the company is so undervalued that the stock would still be cheap. Even if free cash flow gets cut in half the P/FCF would still be just 6.6.Selling Put OptionsBy selling put options you are selling someone the right, but not the obligation, to sell you 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price on or before the expiration date. For this right you receive a premium.Let's take a look at some interesting put options which could be sold:The November 2012 put offers a staggering 39.67% annualized return, but the strike price is only 7.17% below the current market price. If earnings come up short the stock could easily drop this much. The November $31 put offers an equally impressive 19.49% annualized return (1.55% over 29 days) with a strike price a full 12.8% below the current market price. This creates a larger buffer and partially protects you against a severe earnings miss.If you sell the November 2012 $31 put options, there are two possible outcomes.ConclusionI think that sentiment regarding Western Digital is overly pessimistic and that the stock is severely undervalued. The November 2012 $31 put options offers a way to buy the stock at a low price and to receive a 19.49% annualized return for doing so.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

935391,23479,2012-10-19T11:29:48-04:00,,"SanDisk (SNDK) announced its Q3 earnings on Thursday. It reported revenues of $1.27 billion, a 10% decline on a year-over-year basis, but a 23% increase on a sequential basis. [1] Because these numbers were actually higher than what the street estimated, shares of the company jumped around 5% in after-hours trading. Looking at these results we think that the company did a good job to weather tough economic conditions during the quarter. Specifically, the company was able to (1) capitalize well on increasing smartphone demand, (2) implement new OEM partnerships, and (3) position itself to take advantage of stabilizing NAND flash prices.Mobile Drives GrowthSanDisk’s quarter-over-quarter revenue growth was driven by strong growth in its mobile business. We are glad to see that SanDisk was able to capitalize on the rapid increase in smartphone penetration and increased its market share in most major geographies. These market share gains should help the company establish an even stronger foothold in a growing industry, which will ensure that SanDisk’s revenues grow with the overall smartphone market.However, it should be noted that the sales of smartphones are correlated with a stable macroeconomic environment. As the company expects most of its revenue to come from an increasing demand for these products, any hiccups in the world economy could mean surprises to the downside.OEM SuccessesSanDisk reported that it got a lot of wins on the OEM front during the third quarter. The company successful increased capacity to generate high volumes for an undisclosed OEM partner, which was a big contributor to the company’s mobile based growth. Additionally, OEM revenues are expected to drive growth going forward as the company successfully qualified for thirteen new mobile OEM platforms.In our opinion these wins are key since OEM revenues make up almost 60% of SanDisk’s product revenues. Additionally, unlike a retail purchase, these OEM relationships lead to a recurring revenue stream as SanDisk sometimes sets up capacity for a specific customer.Slower Price DeclinesIn our pre-earnings article, we discussed how the improving supply and demand balance in the NAND flash industry could help SanDisk with its top line. The company reported sequential price declines of only 8% in Q3 compared to almost 20% in Q2. This is a big improvement for the company, and could signal health for the NAND flash industry.Additionally, the fact that SanDisk’s NAND price declines were relatively muted when compared with competitor Micron (NASDAQ:MU), signals that the company’s management has done a good job in positioning the company to take advantage of industry trends. This proactive management should help the company time volume increases and decreases a bit better than competitors, which could possibly lead SanDisk to outperform in a highly competitive industry.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"

Here are a few key points that are worth noting:Valuation Ratios: The cheapest Company in America?After the company's earnings release on Monday Oct. 22nd, 2012, several other analysts also downgraded the shares. On Tuesday Oct. 23rd in the pre-market, shares of WDC traded as low as $32 per share.At $32 per share the company's enterprise value was 6.46 B, while EBIDTA (TTM) was 3.46 B. The result was that on Tuesday morning, October 23rd, 2012 the EV/EBIDTA ratio of the company was ~1.86. In other words, based on EBIDTA earnings, the company could recover its entire enterprise value in only 1.86 years. Or stated differently, an acquirer could recover their investment almost in full, in just under two years.These figures seem so low that it was worth filtering all equities traded on US markets to find out if any comparable bargains existed.Four basic criteria were used as follows:1. P/B between .1 and 1.3 (WDC traded at ~ .97 on Oct. 23rd)2. P/E at or below 4 (WDC traded at ~4.12 on Oct. 23rd)3. EV/EBITDA at or below 3 (WDC traded at ~1.86 on Oct. 23rd)4. Market Cap over 500 MThe list produced only one result for all US listed companies: Western Digital Corp.Given these valuation ratios WDC may well be an acquisition target. Seagate Technologies for instance, based on earnings, is also very cheap, however it can not be said that the shares have the same security underlying the issue.Earnings: Calculating future GrowthHere are the one, five, and ten year growth rates for WDC (excluding the most recent quarter):Fig. 1 - Historical Growth Rates for WDCEBITDA, EPS and Book growth rates have far outpaced revenue growth rates (which are significant), that is to say the company is not only getting larger, but also far more profitable.Here is what a graph of the EBITDA earnings per share and EV/EBITDA ratios look like for the last ten years (Q1 FY13 figures are not included in the showing, which would have the effect of increasing the EBITDA figure and lowering the EV/EBITDA number, thus increasing the spread illustrated below):Fig. 2 - EBITDA and EV/EBITDA GraphA review of the historical earnings record will show that Western Digital has been historically very conservative with earnings estimates. Therefore there is no reason to think that the comments above are in any way ""aggressive."" In fact, in the current instance, the estimates (despite lowered guidance for one quarter) have not changed.Here is what the remaining quarters in Fiscal 2013 look like (based on the company's guidance) in terms of both ""Total Addressable Market"" (TAM) and EPS:Fig. 3 - Projecting Forward - Q3 and Q4 EstimatesIf this conservative CFO's figures are correct, the TAM will grow in aggregate by ~20% in the last two quarters of FY 2013, while the EPS figure will grow in aggregate by ~35.7%. Even if this growth did not occur, but rather sales were closer to analysts estimates (~$8 per share), the company would still be well ahead of its own historical rate of growth (Fig. 1).A review (going back to Q2 FY2009) of Actual EPS figures to even high EPS guidance, puts the company's estimates almost always below actual. It may also be worth noting that since the completion of the HGST acquisition (Q3 FY12), the company has lowered its worldwide headcount by well over 10k (from 106,604 to 96,002), or by roughly 10%, despite formerly indicating that there would be no OpEx synergies from the deal until FY 2014.Also, as pointed out in the Amvona article ""Another look at the Low Cost Building Blocks of Storage,"" estimating revenue may not be as simple pegging to the ""TAM"" based on the company's own Q2 FY13 guidance. Since unit volume excludes WD TV Media Players w/o hard drives, WD Livewire, SSD and media, it seems safe to reason that these non-HDD products, the most important of which may be SSD, are indeed growing.Fig. 4 - TAM vs. Rev.Revelations (on a per share basis)Fig. 5 - Effect of recent events on EPS*Calculation based on 246 M shares outstanding.What was learned in the October period is that the future earnings of WDC were augmented for FY13 by a net positive (from previous estimates) of about $2.79 per share. If the company purchases a large number of shares during FY13 as they have indicated they may well do, the figures for points A and B above would increase, while the showing for point C would decrease, leading to a larger overall figure for point D. This says nothing of the possibility of WDC beating estimates (for Q2 FY13), which they often do.However, despite the net positive, the market focused on only the revised guidance for Q2 FY13, even though this revision did not result in an overall revision to the company's FY 2013 EPS forecast as indicated above.""It's not how much money you make, it's how much you keep.""Those are the words of a brilliant Cretan business women who had not even finished primary school. It begs the question how many Harvard MBAs it might take to arrive at the same simple conclusion.The Amvona article On the value of Users, Hard Drives and Batteries, published on June 11th, 2012 paired Western Digital and Facebook for the sake of analysis. Two earnings seasons later it seems like a good time to pair the two again.How does one define ""guidance"" by the quarter or by the year?In the day that followed WDC's Oct. 22nd earnings release which included quarterly net income figures of $594 M (an increase of more than 100% YoY) and subsequent analyst downgrades, the shares lost almost 10% in the pre-market trade (down over 9.5% at one point). This decline followed a ~25% decline in the share price in the nine weeks leading up to the earnings release. One day later Facebook would also announce earnings, a net loss of $59 M, concluding the fourth consecutive decline in quarterly earnings or in the parlance of Wall Street ""Negative Earnings Growth,"" which somehow manages to pair the word ""growth"" with ""negative"" - the shares, after broad analysts upgrades were up as much as 26% the following day.According to Citi, WDC quarterly earnings at 100% YoY growth and more than half a billion dollars, which is set to accelerate dramatically (see above), apparently could not justify a PT of more than $32 (see above), or basically book value. FB on the other hand, with the fourth consecutive quarterly decline in earnings (which finally arrived at a negative figure), and basically flat revenue during the same period, not only has ""fundamental acceleration"" but boasts even a ""reasonable valuation.""Fig. 6 - FB ""A Reasonable Valuation""As of Oct. 26th, 2012If FB were to continue on the current earnings trend, the P/E ratio would soon arrive at infinity, since it would be impossible to calculate the Price to Earnings ratio when there are no earnings. That having been said, FB with it's ~48 B market cap. earned less in the last year (a time when earnings continue to decline), than WDC earned in the last 3 months, yet it is possible to buy nearly six whole Western Digital's for the price of just one Facebook.Fig. 7 - WDC ""Cut... Ratings to Sell from Buy""As of Oct. 26th, 2012Such a definition of ""Reasonable Valuation"" seems like it should be criminal - but it's not. It even seemed like it should be the reason why the Citi Analyst, who ascribed those words to FB was no longer working at Citi only days later - it's not.The timing of such a call may be at the very least ""convenient."" Now that the company is running at a deficit, there is ""fundamental acceleration"" (whatever that means), and a ""reasonable valuation"" - perhaps it would have been helpful for the average retail investor to have been reminded in the same research note of the following:The relationship between analysts, and the timing of share price performance might just be coincidence, if there is such a thing as ""coincidence."" The comments of analysts, whatever their motivations, work in tandem with the media to create extremes of price in both directions (both high and low). Depending on how broad (or narrow) the horizon of the analyst is, even the most simple comments of a company executive can provide the buying (or selling) opportunity of a life time.For example WDC, by guiding lower for Q2 FY13, abides by all safe harbor provisions, and cannot later be accused of overstating earnings guidance or in anyway speculating. It is safe, fair and good for investors to be cautioned - everyone will agree. No harm done. This cautious guidance of course will be the sole item used by analysts (as above) to lower estimates and ratings. These analysts ratings in turn results in an immediately lowered share price. If the company is then able to repurchase its own shares back at a much more favorable price, almost nobody will notice. The company will not be accused of any wrong doing, because they have stated the possibility openly, and the analysts (rather than the company itself) have acted to amplify the perception of bad news, though few will calculate the affects because it requires (only) slightly more math than a simple quarterly EPS estimate.After the shares were sold on August 13th, 2012, the following was written:The largest potential buyer of the shares must be none other than Western Digital with ~2.6 B in outstanding authorization, which on the morning of Oct. 23rd, 2012 represented a full 33% of the company.Perhaps the public market will not reward WDC for its stellar performance after all. This does not mean however that somebody else won't. For this reason increasingly the opinion has formed that WDC itself may have become the ideal take-over target.Time will tell.Disclosure: I am long WDC.

Analyst consensus is looking for $0.34 in earnings per share on $1.2 billion in revenue for year-over-year declines of 72% and 15% respectively, but still better than the 2nd quarter's numbers which fell 25% and 82% respectively.Earnings per share and revenue estimates have ticked slightly higher since the July '12 earnings update, when the company reported their worst quarter in years.The guidance on the 1st quarter 2012 conference call was a killer and investors are still digging out of the hole created when gross margin fell 800 bp's and SNDK's operating margin fell 1100 bp's, thanks to both weak pricing and oversupply of NAND.The semi sector hasn't been a pretty place to be in 2012, with SNDK down 9% this year versus the S&P 500's double-digit return although SNDK looked far worse three months ago.With a full year 2012 estimate of $1.81 and 2013 and 2014 currently looking for $3.22 and $4.02, the stock is starting to trade off 2013 and 2014 recovery, which worries me more than a little bit, since 2012's expected full year earnings decline of 60% is as bad as 2001 and 2008 in terms of the financial results.However it was the q1 '12 conference call where SNDK mentioned that they were supplying ""all"" smartphone makers, which tells us SNDK is now an Apple supplier, so we hope the trough is in for the foreseeable future.The 2nd quarter's results and guidance were actually in line with what the Street was expecting so the stock has rallied $10 per share just on SNDK stabilizing their business.Peak gross margin for SNDK was 49% in q4 '09, but some analysts think that SNDK will only be able to return to a 40% GM, given the increasing dominance of OEM's.Here is a long-term chart of SNDK and you can see the stock maintaining its 50-week moving average, with the uptrend line off the '09 market lows still intact.A number of brokers have commented on stabilizing NAND flash memory prices the last few months which is what is needed to restore margins and drive earnings growth. A note out of Jefferies thinks that Win8 could be a good catalyst for PC's as well as Ultrabooks / Tablets.Sentiment around tech is horrible in general and for semi's it is worse, so we are staying long our SNDK position in client accounts pre-earnings.

Further, the company noted that overall TAM for hard disk drives shrunk from a projected 157M to 140M during the quarter. The company also announced a dividend of $1.00/share on an annualized basis, or 2.44% yield at the most recent close of $41.06, along with adding $1.5B to the existing share repurchase plan.So, is the drop a buying opportunity, or are potential investors walking into a trap?EPS Reiterated: Great If TrueIn the warning, the company reiterated its $10 target EPS target for FY2013. Now, while Western Digital's shared duopoly in the hard disk market with Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) will allow it to command juicy gross margins to nail that $10 EPS target, there are two major headwinds to achieving this target that should not be ignored:However, there are also a number of tailwinds and other factors that will help the firm reach EPS targets:If Western Digital does in fact hit this EPS target, then at the current earnings multiple of 6.37, this would represent upside to $63.7/share, a significant premium to current levels. However, competitor Seagate is currently assigned a multiple of 4.72, so the risk of P/E compression is very real. Western Digital's healthier balance sheet is a likely reason for the higher earnings multiple, however, so P/E compression is not at all guaranteed in this case.Return Of Cash Unattractive Compared To Seagate'sSomething that a lot of investors really look for is the dividend. While Western Digital is finally paying one, its yield of 2.44% is paltry compared to Seagate's 4.2%. Further, a quick look at the history of Seagate's share count versus Western Digital's shows that Seagate's return of cash via buybacks has been much more shareholder friendly:STX Shares Outstanding data by YChartsConclusionWestern Digital at current prices could be quite attractive if the company hits its EPS targets. Its balance sheet is strong with $3.21B in cash and only $2.18B in debt. The weakness in the macro environment and the PC space in general coupled with the broad secular shift to flash storage on the consumer side are definitely causes for concern. However strong pricing power, a solid balance sheet, and low valuations make the company an attractive buy under $40.Disclosure: I am long INTC.

Tech companies have matured, as investments, to the point of harvest. Sales growth gets harder to achieve in a mature industry, and it then becomes the obligation of management to harvest value and share it with shareholders. It's a point made regularly in comments here, from investors hungry for yield.What companies like WDC can offer now is truly amazing. A 4 TB hard drive? Even the WDC salesforce was scratching its head at what to do with that bad boy --- how about analyzing surveillance video?Fact is, with a full-length movie occupying maybe 10 GB of storage, if it's in HD, a 4 TB drive is more room than the hungriest video hoarder really needs - imagine almost 400 movies on a laptop. How long would they take to watch? And let's not get started on how many songs or Bibles that would require - in short we're getting beyond the requirements of the consumer market, which is why WDC is pushing these drives for use in public and private clouds. (Note, however, that by definition clouds are shared resources -- how much time can anyone spend on one?)For consumers the company is pushing the Passport series of external storage devices. Once seen as backups, they're now pushed as desktop additions to your Ultralight or iPad - a way to keep what used to be a desktop storage capacity of 500 GB close. I usually see these at Costco (NASDAQ:COST) for about $100, on discount, and I'm always amazed - imagine 20 cents a gigabyte. (Oh, look -- Belgian chocolates.)And want more? WDC is planning ""helium-filled"" drives next year that are lighter, more rugged, and store more data.

915401,32321,2012-10-10T08:29:00-04:00,,"IntroductionWestern Digital (NYSE:WD) is a leading manufacturer of digital storage devices, namely hard disk drives or HDD. Western Digital recently acquired Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, and achieved strong results from the most recent fiscal year, in spite of floods in Thailand. The story of Western Digital appears quite attractive given some significant secular trends, the company's array of products and scale, and the attractive company valuations. Yet further analysis reveals other significant secular trends and industry characteristics that put Western Digital in a precarious situation. Additionally, there are company specific aspects that are worrisome moving forward. While the company would be a poor short given the company low valuations and managements desire to engineer shareholder value, it is a questionable long term investment because there is a significant risk for business deteriorationRecent Results And Relative ValuationThe company had a very successful fiscal 2012. Revenue increased about 30% while net income more than doubled yoy, in spite of the Thailand flooding. The company experienced an average selling price of $62 compared to $45 in 2011, while keeping costs from rising as fast gross margin. The company's success over the past year has led to the following attractive valuations.The impressive numbers are somewhat misleading because the company benefited from higher average selling prices, which go almost directly to operating profits. Free cash flow was additionally helped by significant positive changes in net working capital from inventory draw downs due to the flood, and greater depreciation and amortization add backs from the HGST acquisition. Further evidence for the one time spike is reflected in Seagate's (NASDAQ:STX) valuations. Nonetheless, the company has consistently generated significant free cash flow over recent history (>$600MM the past 5 years and >$1B over past 3 years). This indicates a more reasonable estimate of a minimum 10% FCF yield which is very healthy. With this, the company announced a $1.5B shareholder repurchase which equates to about 15% of current outstanding shares, in addition to the stock's 2.5+% dividend.Industry TrendsThe storage industry appears promising in the coming years. The demand for petabytes is expected to grow at 33% CAGR through 2016. This is reasonable given major trends in the industry. Personal devices and consumer electronics from smart phones to tvs are consistently using more and more memory. The proliferation of social media and the growth of the internet will continue to require more storage space. Finally, cloud computing represents a major overhaul of electronic infrastructure for servers, which will need to be replaced while storage needs rise. These ideas support strong long term performance in this space.Traditional HDD producers, such as Western Digital and competitor Seagate, may be ill-suited to take advantage of this trend compared to companies such as Micron (NASDAQ:MU), SanDisk (SNDK), and OCZ (NASDAQ:OCZ), which have a greater focus on solid state drives, or SSD. SSD is superior to HDD in the areas of data transfer rate, data read rate, search speed, power consumption, and operating temperature. The main advantages of HDD are reliability, because HDD failures are reversible, and price: SSD, on a $/GB basis, is approximately 10X more expensive than HDD. Prices of SSD are falling very quickly, but price competitiveness is not expected in the near future. However, the differences in performance imply that SSD can be more expensive than HDD and become the storage of choice. Western Digital admits this weakness in its most recent 10K:""Alternative storage technologies like solid-state storage technology have successfully served digital entertainment markets for products such as digital cameras, MP3 players, USB flash drives, mobile phones and tablet devices that cannot be economically serviced using hard drive technology.""The company will be unable to take advantage of the need for memory in the personal device space. In fact about 73% of the company's revenue comes from the PC business, meaning Western Digital is tied to slower growth areas. Additionally, it appears HDD will lose market share to SSD in the server industry as cloud computing takes hold. Cloud computing allows a server company to host the servers of multiple company's on one larger server, implying servers will grow in size. Companies will still demand the same performance for their servers in terms of speed. If these servers used HDD, their size would cause sluggish performance because the system has to mechanically look for information. However, SSD performance is largely independent of size because data storage is electronic, allowing SSD to scale without sacrificing speed. This idea is promising for the aforementioned SSD manufacturers, but negative for predominant HDD producers.Market Structure And Western Digital's PositionAnother major negative for the whole industry, and especially, HDD producers, the market is purely competitive, as quality is similar and price is the main point of competition. The SSD and HDD markets do not just compete on price, but within the SSD market, price is the major point of competition. Although Western Digital claims to compete on customer service, reliability, storage capacity and other ways, in addition to price, anecdotal evidence from online tech forums indicates similar levels of satisfaction from Seagate and Western Digital consumers. If either company provided a better experience, this should manifest itself in higher selling prices; but after examining online retailers, there is no appreciable difference in price between drives of similar specs. This indicates that storage is essentially a commodity.There are companies, such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Under Armour (NYSE:UA), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), or Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), that have survived as sellers of commodities and achieved disproportionate profitability. Coca-Cola has established an incredible brand name, and customer loyalty through longevity, and successful marketing. Under Armour was the first mover in the performance apparel market, allowing its name to be synonymous with performance apparel. Exxon Mobil has succeeded because of its vertical and horizontal integration allowing it to produce at lower costs than competitors and to access resources that require immense capital that others do not have. Wal-Mart has been successful because it has monopolized its market allowing it to squeeze its suppliers, which allows it to undercut competitors while still profiting. These ideas allow these companies to either sell the commodity at a lower price than competitors while still profiting, or to sell the commodity at a higher price while still experiencing demand.None of these principles applies to Western Digital. As mentioned earlier, consumers are split between makers of hard drives; there is no brand loyalty or the ability to charge inflated prices. Western Digital, if anything, is the industry follower because it has historically released similar technology after Seagate, precluding a reputation of prowess. Western Digital is not experiencing economies of scale as margins are mainly a function of average selling price and not great production. Western Digital's costs of production are essentially fixed. Western Digital produces the heads and magnetic media and already achieved all appreciable cost reduction. These parts are made from rare earth metals, putting Western Digital at the whims of global supply and demand of these metals. Western Digital gets other parts from unique suppliers with many customers, allowing these companies to squeeze Western Digital. The company is forced into $6.5B, or 2/3 of last year's gross costs of purchase obligations for the coming year. The company is heavily dependent upon research just to remain competitive, and the company has old machinery, as the cost value of its PP&E, after taking out land values is about $6B, while accumulated depreciation is over $3B. Cost reductions in these areas are unlikely. Additionally, Western Digital is squeezed by purchasers; more than 50% of the company's revenue comes from ten OEMs. Customers can cancel orders at almost any time and demand price protection deals from Western Digital.Average Selling Price: The Engine Of ProfitabilityThe company's fortunes depend on average selling price more than any other factor. Significant volume expansion is unlikely because increased storage demand is matched by equal improvements in storage technology. Every change in average selling price travels almost directly to the company's bottom line. For example the company's average selling price climbed by about 37% and the company's gross margin and net income more than doubled from the prior year. In 2010, the average selling price was 11% higher than 2011, leading to net income that was almost 90% higher in 2010. The problem is that Western Digital has zero ability to raise average selling price. The market is oligopolistic companies would be better if they jointly produced less to drive up the price, but game theory dictates they produce more than they should. In some respects, the floods in Thailand were a blessing to the company's fortunes. This supply shock allowed Seagate and Western Digital to achieve oversized profits by shrinking supply. Although these prices may remain elevated in the near future, in time they will fall back in line with averages. From there, prices will likely grow slowly or even decline, as it did from 2010 to 2011. Storage technology is constantly improving from fierce competition. But it is very difficult to raise prices because costs have not risen. If SSD becomes more price competitive, HDD average selling prices will also decline. An investment in Western Digital is inherently a bet on average selling price of storage, which in the long run has numerous factors working against it.Company Specific IssuesIn addition to these issues affecting Western Digital and some of its competitors, there are areas specific to Western Digital that cause worry about the future. The acquisition of HGST is one of these. HGST has been one of the major HDD producers, but Hitachi was willing to sell of this business, possibly seeing some of the aforementioned industry headwinds. Western Digital justifies the acquisition in its most recent 10K (p.84) by saying:HGST will remain a subsidiary with independent production until the Chinese Ministry Of Commerce approval, which is at least 2 years away. Consequently, scale, if possible will not be achieved for at least this time period. Even if the merger is approved, operating synergies are unlikely because Western Digital has already reached scale. The only promising aspect of the deal is some of the new SSD technology of HGST; nonetheless HGST is dominated by HDD unlike a company such as Micron. This deal realistically just increases market share but at a hefty premium.Western Digital's research and development has lagged behind Seagate's. Although the company has consistently spent nearly 10% of revenue on R&D, the company has regularly finished second to Seagate. Seagate is currently on its third version of a hybrid drive, which combines aspects of SDD and HDD, while Western Digital is just introducing its first version. Western Digital's recent technological breakthrough is helium filled drives which promises significant less energy consumption and an increase of almost 50% storage capacity from today's standard 4GB platters. However, Seagate's Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording technology has the potential to increase storage capacity of these standard drives to 50GB. Western Digital has been successful at following. However, there is no guarantee Western Digital will be able to in the near future. Additionally, Seagate's technology appears more disruptive than Western Digital's, implying that even if Western Digital is able to replicate the technology, the time period Western Digital does not have the technology, will present few profits.The company also has a very beneficial tax situation. In fact, $2.98 of the company's 2012 EPS, and similar figures for prior years, was the result of tax holidays for foreign operations. If these countries decide to raise taxes from these incredibly low levels, it will significantly impact Western Digital's profitability. This situation could easily not come to pass; however, it is a negative asymmetric situation.Finally, the company may be facing increased costs from employee compensation in the future. At the time of issue, the company prices stock options to employees based upon the Black Scholes model. After issuance, however, the company values in the money options as the difference between the current price and the strike price. This is not an issue when options are short term and very in the money. However, a significant volatility and time premium exists for long term options just in the money. The weighted average remaining life of employees' options outstanding is 4.3 years, with many having strike prices above $30 compared to the current price of approximately $38. This generous accounting is not egregious, but it is not practiced at every company and should concern an investor.ConclusionIt is worth reiterating that Western Digital could easily outperform the markets in the near future given elevated average selling prices resulting from the Thailand floods, the cheap valuations of the company, and management's commitment to squeeze out shareholder value. However, a HDD producer is not well suited to take advantage of major storage trends. Furthermore, Western Digital operates in an extremely competitive arena, forcing it to operate at the wishes of suppliers and consumers, and causing its fortunes to depend upon the average selling price. Western Digital has already achieved economies of scale and the HGST acquisition will likely not improve efficiency. Finally, the company has had a relatively poor history of innovation and could face increased costs from changes in the tax system and growing employee compensation costs. It is recommended that a long term investor choose not to purchase shares of Western Digital.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Amidst all this chaos, the technology sector continues to outperform many other sectors, as consumers continue to spend on devices in spite of the sad state of economy. Sandisk Corp (SNDK) is poised to benefit greatly as more and more portable devices are used.Sector CoverageIn the past few months, I have covered Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) closely - both big players in the Hard Disk Drives (or HDDs) market. These articles mainly addressed the Hard Disk Drives (or HDDs) market. There is a great opportunity for investors in the same industry of Computer Data Storage, but a much different technology - Solid State Drives (or SSDs). Among all the companies in the SSDs business, SanDisk appears to have the best bang for the buck. Let us discuss why.HDDs vs. SDDs in layman termsIntroduced in 1956 by IBM, HDDs have always been the ultimate storage option for personal computers and enterprise servers. HDDs have data stored on a ""platter"" that spins, and a mechanical movement of the read/write head is required to read or write data that is stored at a specific location on the platter. HDDs are mainly used when a lot of storage capacity is required (mostly over 500 GB), disk size does not matter, and of course where cost matters (HDD costs about $0.10 per Gigabyte) more than an ultra-fast performance.In an SSD, data gets stored in microchips, and accessing the data does not require mechanical movement of the read/write head. This makes the SSD faster in performance and smaller in size. Cost wise, SSD is 15 times more costly than the HDD, at $1.50 per Gigabyte. There are other advantages of SSD over HDD - like not being affected by interfering magnetism, lesser noise and vibration, and lesser power draw which results in higher battery life - some very important factors for portable devices.TrendsSSDs have completely taken over the tablets and are gaining traction in the portable computers space (ultrabooks use SSDs). One must note that SSDs need major technological advances to match HDDs' low cost and high capacity parameters, and until that happens, demand for HDDs especially in the personal computers and enterprise servers space will continue to thrive. HDDs continue to sell at high prices in the near term, thanks to supply disruptions caused by Thailand floods and global demand for computer storage. Nevertheless, companies that are entirely or heavily dependent on earnings from HDD sales should rethink their strategy and product portfolios. Solid State Drives (or SSDs) will eventually start posing a bigger threat than it does today to the demand of HDDs.SanDisk's FundamentalsSanDisk's products are used in a much wider range of electronic products, such as digital cameras, smart phones, laptops, MP3 players and gaming consoles.ConclusionFrom a fifty thousand feet view, the data storage industry will remain a thriving market for the next few years because of increased use of digitization, e-recordkeeping, cloud computing and Big Data analytics that is used for business intelligence.Investors should make hay of this opportunity by selecting companies with higher growth estimates for the next many quarters, and especially with a strategy that aligns with the technology and business trends in the market.Comparing the available stock alternatives in the SSD market, SanDisk stands out like a diamond in the rough.RisksThe biggest risk to Sandisk's further appreciation is greatly reduced consumer spending due to economic conditions. Also, the computer storage industry remains highly competitive and often market consolidations result in price compression, which in turn reduce the company's margins. SSD continues to advance technologically, the prices cannot remain this high all the time. Investors must understand these risks before initiating long positions.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

SanDisk has a three-pronged approach with respect to future execution—continue to drive scaling of NAND, partner with Toshiba in the development of vertical NAND or Bit Cost Scalable (BiCS) NAND and the development of 3D Resistive RAM (ReRAM). SanDisk's plan is to use BiCS technology as a bridge for the development of 3D ReRAM.While SanDisk reported 10% sequential revenue growth in its Q2 2012 earnings call held on July 19, 2012, the company dropped a negative bombshell in the previous quarter and as a result its stock price took a big hit as shown below:In the Q1 2012 earnings call held on April 20, 2012, the company attributed the negative performance to a demand/supply imbalance, and expected the imbalance to continue in Q2, but expected the imbalance to ease in the second half of the year.The company has a number of initiatives for forward progress, including the development of new products for the mobile device market, which is expected to drive revenue growth in Q3 2012. In Q2, the company began initial revenue shipments to customers for embedded solutions, which is expected to contribute significantly to revenue going forward.SanDisk has completed qualification and began initial shipments of new multi-chip package (MCP) solutions to some smartphone customers. The MCP is essentially an iNAND embedded product packaged with mobile DRAMs.SanDisk's next generation high performance iNAND is currently in testing and qualification stages with various mobile OEM customers.The company's Client Solid State Drive (SSD) products continue to scale nicely and the company also experienced strong sequential growth in Enterprise SSDs. The company also began shipments of first-generation PCIe solution with 200 gigabyte and 400 gigabyte configurations.In Q2, 50% of the production mix was 19-nanometer technology. Going forward, the company excepts to increase the mix of two-bit memory, as embedded mobile and SSD applications are expected to use two-bit memory technology.The company noted the launch of several new smartphones and tablet devices in the second half of 2012, along with a number of SSD-equipped Ultrabooks, is expected to drive the demand for NAND Flash. SanDisk does not plan a major capacity increase until sometime in 2013.In a series of previous articles related to SanDisk, a married put position was first considered for the company, followed by a series of bull-put credit spreads. The losing married put position was exchanged for a bull-put credit spread, in an effort to recover from the loss and generate a profit. The bull-put credit spread was rolled several times, with the latest bull-put credit position having an aggregate potential return of 16%. The latest bull-put credit spread, consisting of a 2012 Oct 24/29 put spread, is now 30% out-of-the-money and can be exited for a net debit of $0.21 as shown below:Click to enlargeSince SanDisk appears to be doing much better, the current bull-put credit spread position is now out of trouble, and since time decay occurs for shorter time-frame options, it would be nice to roll from October options to August options. Looking at August bull-put credit spreads for SanDisk reveals:The 2012 Aug 33/38 bull-put credit spread can be entered for a credit of $0.37, so combined with the net debit for closing the 2012 Oct 24/29 put spread of $0.21, the roll can be executed for a total net credit of $0.16, which represents an additional potential return of 3.3%. This takes the total potential return, including previous trades, to a total aggregate potential return of 19.3%. The details for the roll trade are shown below:TradeFor those having not participated in the previous positions, a new position can be entered with a potential return of 8% (133% annualized) as shown below:TradeA profit/loss graph for one contract of the 2012 Aug 33/38 put spread, not including previous positions, is shown below:For a stock price above the $38 strike price of the short put option at expiration, the position is fully profitable. For a stock price below the $33 strike price of the long put option, the position is a total loss, however, the position should be rolled prior to sustaining a loss.A new management point is set for $39.50. If the price of the stock drops below $39.50, the position should be managed for an exit or a roll.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
763581,23255,2012-07-30T20:14:23-04:00,,"Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) reported fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings last Wednesday afternoon that achieved the rare trifecta: surpassed analysts' estimates for EPS and revenue, raised full year 2013 guidance above consensus, and had a ""clean"" report with bullish management discussions. Fourth quarter revenue nearly doubled to $4.8 billion (fueled by the Hitachi acquisition), and quarterly EPS was $2.87, both of which exceeded consensus opinions. I declared Western Digital The Best Bargain in Tech in early June, and it has rallied nearly 30%, from the low $30s to nearly $41 in early trading last Thursday. The stock eased back to $40 by the close on Friday, which leaves it just 10 percent below its 52-week high. After this quick surge in a difficult economy, I can no longer call WDC a bargain, but this tech all-star is well positioned to continue its ascent. I analyzed the full earnings release and conference call, and I wanted to highlight a few key points below that affirm my buy rating on Western Digital.(click image to enlarge)WDC Continues To Be A Cash ChampionI was originally attracted to Western Digital due to its strong liquidity, and the company's financial position is continuing to improve. Cash per share only decreased by $0.60 to ~$12.30, and currently accounts for approximately 30% of the company's current market capitalization. I tend to focus less on net cash with WDC because the conversion cycle is a very strong positive at two days. This slight decline in cash is despite a $300 million investment in PP&E, $600 million debt repayment, and the repurchase of $600 million common shares. Management still has another $1.3 billion available for repurchases that it says will be deployed more ""systematically"" going forward. Western Digital's commitment to returning funds to shareholders only strengthens my confidence in the company.Seagate Supply Concerns Are A Non-IssueSeagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) warned in early July that it was facing ""supplier quality issues"" that would negatively impact shipment of hard drives. This news not only impacted Seagate, but also drove Western Digital down nearly five percent. Seagate and Western Digital have an effective duopoly in the hard disk drive (""HDD"") space, so it was only natural to believe that the issues would impact WDC as well. I was initially skeptical about how serious the issues would be, and I am still puzzled about what Seagate was referring to. WDC basically dismissed this issue on the call. In response to a direct question, CEO John F. Coyne stated, ""there's always occasional this, that, and the other thing, but nothing significant."" Many investors prefer Seagate due to its dividend, but Western Digital is emerging as the better play as it continues to take market share.The Cloud Is Still KingWDC was the victim of numerous downgrades and bearish reports this past quarter as concerns that consumers were shifting more to solid state drives took priority over the real cloud story. The positive reviews surrounding Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) new MacBook Air and the iPad will certainly accelerate the adoption rate of solid state drives, but the economics of hybrid hard drives (HDD) still necessitates their use for cloud storage. Out of the 71 million HDD shipped in the quarter, 54 million were to the client space, indicating that WDC will continue to thrive in the cloud. As I emphasized in my last WDC article, the success of Apple and other companies that help to generate content (pictures, videos, etc.) will benefit Western Digital in the long-term, as it will spur increased demand for cloud storage.Future OPEX Benefits On The HorizonWestern Digital completed its acquisition of Hitachi in 2011. Due to regulatory requirements, however, it still must operate Hitachi as separate subsidiary for a minimum of two years. As a result, the typical operating expense synergies associated with such a large acquisition will not materialize in the near-term. Furthermore, the company had approximately $40 million of acquisition related charges this quarter that are unlikely to recur going forward. The acquisition is already yielding healthy benefits to the top line, and further cost savings are likely to emerge in future years.How To Play ItAnalysts were quick to revise their price targets after the earnings release, with five brokerages updating their targets. For example, Citi increased its price target from $40 to $49, while Barclays revised upward from $32 to $38, which is currently below the market price. I am still bullish on Western Digital's future; however, I took advantage of the pop last Thursday to sell WDC Aug 3 2012 (Weekly) $41 Calls, which I hope will expire worthless. Seagate reported earnings today that failed to meet revenue or earnings targets. The stock had a cautious outlook, and is currently down approximately eight percent after-hours. This news has knocked Western Digital down almost three percent, but I believe Seagate suffers from many unique issues. Long term, I see Western Digital testing and surpassing its 52-week high of $44. I wish you congratulations if you followed my advice on WDC before earnings, but this success story is far from over. With a forward P/E of 5.2, this is still a very attractive investment that can climb higher.Disclosure: I am long AAPL, WDC, and short  WDC Aug 3 (Weekly) 41 Calls."
837981,32101,2012-08-30T10:40:14-04:00,,"The notoriously difficult hard disc drive (""HDD"") industry has recently undergone major consolidation: Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) absorbed Samsung's HDD business on December 11, 2011; and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) acquired Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (""HGST"") on March 8th, 2012.In this piece, we are going to focus on one half of this duopoly: Western Digital. For those interested in Seagate, I've written about them here.Founded in 1970, Western Digital has been crowned the largest hard disc producer in the world. As of last quarter, Western Digital's share represented approximately 44% of HDDs shipped. (Seagate's share represented approximately 42% of all units shipped.) In addition to the large market share, the flooding in Thailand created a supply and demand disequilibrium that forced up the price of HDDs generally - and both companies have benefited.Industry CycleThe industry has typically had a two-year product cycle. This is to point out that overall industry gross margins will probably fall in the near term, before, subsequently, rising again - that is, if the past is any guide to the future:WDC Gross Profit Margin data by YChartsFurther, cash generated from operations follows a similar pattern - although, Western Digital mitigates it more than Seagate:WDC Cash Operations TTM data by YChartsAll this is to say that we need to be careful when valuing Western Digital because of where we are within broader industry trends.ThailandWe also need to be careful because this past year has allowed for greater than normal prices, or higher average-selling-prices (""ASPs""), due, again, to the supply disruption. In Western Digital's recently released fiscal 2012 10-K, we find:Therefore, when looking forward, we have to view the world as it was before this current blip in supra-profitability.Price ErosionHDDs are interchangeable products: most people probably do not know which company made the HDD in their computer. They are also a ""commodified"" product, or a product which has the trait of increasing unit volumes and decreasing unit price.Before the supply and demand disruptions due to the flooding in Thailand, the trend of prices was quite a bit different:(source: Western Digital 2011-10-K, p. 34)As you can see, average selling price was declining before the start of fiscal 2012. While this past year was a break from this trend, we can be assured that such a declining trend will continue. A notable quote from Seagate 2011 10-K:So ASPs will re-enter their decline once supply catches up with demand. And to express how different this past year was, let's remember that Western Digital had a fiscal 2012 ASP of $62 per unit. The last time they had an ASP like that was in 2004, in which they had an ASP of $63 per unit (see Western Digital fiscal 2004 10-K, page 18).Industry GrowthThe HDD industry shipped 599 million units this past year, down from the fiscal 2011 count of 657 million. In late summer 2011, before the Thailand floods, it was projected that the HDD market would grow about 4% that year. If those demand projections were correct, we ought to watch for ASPs to re-enter their decline when industry supply finally catches up with the projected demand, or, rather, when Seagate and Western Digital (and the remaining 14% of manufactures) produce 683 million drives cumulatively (657 million * 4% growth). But on top of the current supply and demand dislocation, significantly more demand is expected by Western Digital. According to page 4 of their 2012 10-K:Some Basic DetailsTo finance their purchase of HGST, Western Digital issued 25 million shares of common stock to Hitachi (HGST's old parent) - who now owns 10% of Western Digital. The purchase price was $4.7 billion in cash, the issued shares, and also new debt. Illustrated in the hockey stick graph below:WDC Revenue data by YChartsWhile the stock issuance diluted the stockholders, the debt is no problem - their cash position greater than the total debt. And as you can see above, the combined revenues make for a pretty picture.ValuationUsing standard P/E, we see that, for two companies who just secured themselves a duopoly, they have rather low P/Es:In inverse proportion to the low P/E, we see that their FCF1 yield has increased with their lower share price:ConclusionThose free-cash-flow yields are fantastic - no question about that. So the question is can these rates of earnings continue? While I hope that I demonstrated that the profitability Western Digital and Seagate achieved last year is unique in many respects, it is likely that the industry consolidation has put them on a powerful new footing.As stated earlier, we will likely continue to see the characteristic fluctuations in the gross profit margin due to the industry's product cycle. So, with both (1) the resumption of a declining trend in ASPs and (2) the end of peak gross profit margins in the near term, I still believe that the duopoly that these two companies have forged is incredibly valuable.Perhaps the market is taking into account the unique results of the past trailing twelve months, but the current market price may not be taking into account the fact that the industry is now mainly split between two parties.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

854001,29461,2012-09-07T15:52:55-04:00,,"Last year was a disastrous one for Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). The company's production took a beating due to floods in Thailand, where it has the majority of its production facilities. WDC has recovered superbly from the blow, and has posted stellar results for its fourth quarter and financial year. We believe that the prospects for WDC are tremendous, especially because of an imminent Windows 8 launch. The stock is currently trading at P/E of 5x, and we believe a Windows 8 launch can take it to 10x.Business OverviewWestern Digital Corporation is primarily involved in the business of making storage devices. The company has three main technology brand names; WD, HGST and G-Technology. WDC's primary business is making data storage equipment; however, it also manufacturers and markets networking equipment and home entertainment products. The company's products are approximately 73% dependent on notebook/PC sales. Western Digital has recently involved itself in making software applications for the smartphone/tablet market. The tablet/smartphone industry has shown tremendous growth in the last few years, and has resulted in a slowdown of the PC/notebook business. This has created a dynamic shift in the industry, as smartphone/tablets primarily rely on cloud-based applications. High demand for cloud-based applications has encouraged enterprises to use tiered storage architectures. Tried storage architectures use high performance/capacity storage and solid state hard drives (NYSE:SSD). According to company disclosures, it is expecting the growth in global storage to be 33% between 2011 and 2016.As we mentioned in our previous write-ups, the market for patents is currently highly liquid. Therefore, it is worth mentioning that WDC has a highly valuable patent portfolio of 6,000 patents. Last year, the company faced a huge set back due to floods in Thailand. WDC relies heavily on its Thailand-based factories for manufacturing, and currently employees approximately 37,000 personal in the country. These floods adversely impacted the PC/notebook industry by creating a storage shortage, and resulted in an increase in prices. DRAM overcapacity was also created due to these floods.FY2012Source: YChartsThe recent fiscal year has been a magical one for WDC. The company reported stellar results for the year, beating analyst estimates. The exceptionally good performance in the last quarter made the major difference. Analysts were expecting EPS of $2.47, actual results showed a 35% increase, meaning that EPS were $3.35. The company reported revenues of $4.75 billion, beating consensus estimates of $4.25 billion. The primary reason behind these beats was a quick recovery from the Thailand floods disaster. The company had to suspend manufacturing at some of its biggest plants due to the floods.Source: Company DisclosuresOperational performance has improved in FY2012 as compared to previous years. 4Q2012 results were the best in the last four years, as can be seen in the figure.Source: Company DisclosuresThe significance of the current year's performance can be assessed from the considerable improvement in the company's market share standing. During the last three years, WDC had a market share of approximately 30%. After a dip in 2Q2012, due to reduced production as a result of the floods, the company has bounced back and gained a market share of approximately 45%.Figure: HDD units soldSource: Company DisclosuresTotal HDD units sold increase from 44 million in 3Q2012 to 71 million in 4Q2012. The increase comes from an increase in the number of units sold to notebooks and desktops. HDD sales to desktops increased by 40% to 21 million, and sales to notebooks increased by approximately 80% to 32 million. Enterprise, Branded and Consumer Electronic sales also showed significant increases QoQ.Financial StrengthSource: ReutersAs the data given above shows, the company has solid fundamentals. The quick ratio and current ratio are both better than the industry averages. Total debt-to-equity for WDC is 28%, as compared to 51 for the industry. A very high interest coverage ratio is also an indicator of the company's financial stability.Sell Side OpinionAnalyst opinion on the company is positive. Analyzing the opinions of 23 analysts shows that approximately 11 are calling for a hold position on the stock. The company doesn't have any underperform of sell ratings for the current month. 12 analysts currently give the company a buy or strong buy rating for the current month.Source: Yahoo FinanceValuationsThe stock is currently trading at forward 2014 P/E of 5x. There are a number of catalysts that can affect stock performance in this half of 2012. The release of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Windows 8 will also positively impact sales and stock price. The consensus EPS estimate for the next year is $9.27. Using a 5 year historical average P/E of 10x, we calculate a price target of $92 for WDC, an upside of 120%.ConclusionWe believe there is a significant upside to WDC. The company will be positively affected by the general trend towards cloud computing. The Windows 8 release will be a primary catalyst in driving sales of notebooks and PCs. As a significant portion of the company's sales are generated from these sources, we believe the company will benefit from this increase in PC/notebook sales. Therefore, we are bullish on WDC.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Technology Analyst.

We think so and peg its fair value in the low-$50s.Our Report on Western Digital imagesInvestment ConsiderationsInvestment HighlightsWestern Digital earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 55.8% during the past three years.Western Digital has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 6.9% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 0.8 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 22.2%.Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company. We also think its fair value is modestly higher than where it is trading currently.The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 18.7% during the past 3 years. We expect its revenue growth to be below that of its peer median during the next five years.Economic Profit AnalysisValuentum may be our corporate name, but it is much more than that. It is a new style of investing - not value, not growth, not GARP, not momentum, but Valuentum. We combine an extensive three-stage discounted cash flow process (creating complete pro-forma financial statements) with a relative value assessment (price-to-earnings, PEG) and then add on a technical and momentum overlay to identify the best entry and exit points on the most attractive stocks on the market today. Western Digital registers a 6 on our Valuentum Buying Index (our stock-selection methodology) -- not the best of scores, but respectable, nonetheless.We think the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Western Digital's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 55.8%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 11.4%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair valueestimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Western Digital's free cash flow margin has averaged about 13.4% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information on the differences between these two measures, please visit our website at Valuentum.com. At Western Digital, cash flow from operations increased about 58% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 3% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Western Digital's shares are worth between $31.00 - $71.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's HIGH ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $51 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 7.8 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 4 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 4.3% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 18.7%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 14.2%, which is aboveWestern Digital's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 0% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Western Digital, we use a 11.4% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $51 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Western Digital. We think the firm is attractive below $31 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $71 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Western Digital's fair value at this point in time to be about $51 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Western Digital's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $73 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $51 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The firm has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. Return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) has averaged 141.1% during the past three years.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $33, we'd take a closer look at adding it to the market-beating Best Ideas portfolio.SanDisk has an excellent combination of strong free cash flow generation and low financial leverage. We expect the firm's free cash flow margin to average about 11.5% in coming years. Total debt-to-EBITDA was 0.9 last year, while debt-to-book capitalization stood at 18.5%.Although we think there may be a better time to dabble in the firm's shares based on our DCF process, the firm's stock has outperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter, indicating increased investor interest in the company.The firm experienced a revenue CAGR of about 19.1% during the past three years. We expect its revenue growth to be below that of its peer median during the next five years.Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (NASDAQ:ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. SanDisk's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 141.1%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.1%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. SanDisk's free cash flow margin has averaged about 18.2% during the past three years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. For more information DCF valuation, please visit our website at Valuentum. At SanDisk, cash flow from operations increased about 116% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 170% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that SanDisk's shares are worth between $33.00 - $57.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $45 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 11.1 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 5.4 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 5.3% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 19.1%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 15.8%, which is below SanDisk's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 1% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For SanDisk, we use a 10.1% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $45 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for SanDisk. We think the firm is attractive below $33 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $57 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate SanDisk's fair value at this point in time to be about $45 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of SanDisk's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $61 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $45 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Pro Forma Financial StatementsDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

930501,34101,2012-10-17T15:14:35-04:00,,"NAND flash memory maker SanDisk (SNDK) is expected to benefit from the supply constraints faced after Toshiba and Samsung have cut their production. The benefits can be seen in the third-quarter earnings report, scheduled to be announced Oct. 18 after the market closes.The demand for NAND flash memory will continue to be strong until at least the first half of 2013 if analysts' estimates are true. This optimistic view is based on some facts.NAND flash memory is a component for smartphones, e-readers, media tablets, and ultrabooks. Typically, third and fourth quarters generate higher demand due to the holiday season in the fourth quarter. Smartphones and media tablets generate more interest among consumers.There are reports suggesting that analysts' expect Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 5 to record sales of at least 50 million units in the fourth quarter. SanDisk is one of the suppliers of NAND flash memory to Apple. SanDisk will also likely to benefit from Apple's lowered reliance on Samsung due to a changed relationship after the patent issue. Aside from this, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is launching its surface tablet PC later this month. The software company will also unveil its much expected Windows 8. The launch of Windows 8 could lift the PC shipment to some extent as consumers who are holding off on their purchases may want to buy during the holiday season.Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Motorola have either launched new products recently or will be launching new products in the coming weeks to take advantage of the holiday season sales. The first half also witnessed holding back of rebuilding the inventories due to macroeconomic issues. Now that the macro uncertainty seems to have receded from the sky-high levels, the rebound is expected in the second half. These factors should support the demand side.The demand for NAND flash memory will exceed supply after Toshiba has initiated a 30% production cut from July 24. Samsung also followed suit and converted to produce logic products from memory chips. These two companies scaling down production plans have not only reduced the inventory in the market to improve the demand/supply curve, the move has also resulted in price stabilization at first. Now, the makers are effecting a price rise of up to approximately 15%.Meanwhile, in a research note to clients, S&P Capital IQ analyst Angelo Zino thinks that the recent inflection in flash prices should result in higher gross margins for SanDisk. The analyst also believes that consensus is underestimating the price realization. Zino said, ""We think supply constraints are likely to last through the first half of 2013, and we see healthy demand prospects."" The analyst added, ""We're keeping our 12-month target price at $55, on a blend of P/E and price-to-sales within peer and historical ranges.""Click to enlarge image.Interestingly, the point and figure chart above suggests a bullish price objective of $67.00. Currently, the stock is trading above the 50-day as well as the 200-day moving averages of $43.72 and $39.35, respectively. The chart also indicates that after the production cut was announced in July, the stock started moving on an upward trajectory. More weakening in end-market demand, competitive pressures, and price erosion could impact the results.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

757081,24178,2012-07-27T13:49:50-04:00,,"On July 25, 2012 Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:WDC) announced its FY2012 results - and beat consensus estimates EPS of $2.44.  In after hours trading on July 24 as well as today, the shares moved up slightly, so it seemed like a good time to take a look back at some of the Amvona analysis of the company. On December 2nd, 2011 the article ""Hard Drives, Floods, Monasteries and Investment Returns"" was published. At the time, a fair value to a prospective acquirer was estimated at about $67 per share. Today that figure likely still represent an accurate appraisal of the value as a whole to an acquirer, however for long term value investors operating on a Discounted Cash Value basis, the shares may be worth as much as ~$120 (assumptions: EPS=10, 10 yr. GR at 7 %, 10 yr. TG at 3%, DR = 12%, TB = $19.50).The November article also included the following points on profitability:Under the ""notes"" section of the article, the following was scribbled out back on that day in November:On July 5, 2012, barely seven months after we wrote these words, STX released preliminary fiscal fourth qtr. 2012 financial results saying in part:Seagate was downgraded by analysts at Robert W. Baird from an “outperform” rating to a “neutral” rating  on Friday July 20, 2012. On July 25, 2012, just 20 days later and just over seven months after the Amvona article was published, WDC had their management conference call to discuss Q4 2012 results with CEO John Coyne stating:And:And finally:The recent comments by the two CEOs seem to indicate that the original reasoning in the December article was correct. Despite Seagate's huge advantage coming out of the Thai floods (none of its facilities was affected, unlike Western Digital), the advantage doesn't appear to have lasted even a year.On November 15th Needham and Co. issued the following report:Two days later, we were out buying shares of WDC for investors' accounts. Here are examples of the purchases made that the article referenced, along with performance data as of the writing of this article:Wait! That was our price target...On Friday March 23, 2012 Amvona published the follow up article entitled ""Wait! That was our price target and other musings on Memory and storage"" -- the article makes the following comments:Consider the case of the Needham and Co. March 22 upgrade:The WDC Q4 2012 CC appears to confirm another part of the Amvona article namely:On the Q4 CC, CFO Wolfgang Nickl commented:The Problem with ""The Sidelines""On Tuesday May 1, 2012 Amvona published the article ""Silver Platters, Annie Oakley and ""The Sidelines"", which included commentary from Bank of America analyst Scott Craig and CitiGroup analyst Joe Yoo.In light of the most recent WDC earnings, the following seems relevant (from the Amvona article): The Amvona NG estimate was .89 cents (36%) higher than consensus.From the company's July 25 CC:Unfortunately the Amvona EPS estimate, on the high end, overshot (by a penny), and to make matters worse, the Revenue estimate was off too... by 5 M (or about half of one percent) - from the article:The article concluded with the following:Here are examples of the purchases made that the article referenced along with performance data as of the writing of this article:Just in case...Finally, because seven articles on the wisdom of buying WDC may not have been enough, on Monday June 11th, 2012 Amvona published the short 7,800 word manifesto entitled ""On the value of Users, Hard Drives and Batteries"" the article explores the idea of an investment in WDC as opposed to speculative bets such as Linkedin Corp. (LNKD) and the newly public Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) - 19 of the 7,800 words said simply:In retrospect, perhaps the article could have just been left at that, and the other 7,781 words omitted.Either way, here is how the 3 issues performed in the roughly 2 + months since then:*Update: FB dropped an additional ~18.5% AH on July 26th, 2012This time proof of the value of WDC went into far greater detail from a balance sheet perspective. However, the estimates provided in the article for the share repo. were overly aggressive (the article estimated as many as 30 M shares could have been taken back in FQ4) -- as it turns out WDC only spent 604 M buying back 16.4 M shares - but there's a catch.Here is what the company had to say in the recent CC on this point:The key point here is ""during the June quarter..."", but these comments were made 25 days after the June quarter. During two thirds of the ""June QTR"" the share price was relatively high. However, during the first 25 days of July the price was quite low, and since the share repo was admittedly ""opportunistic"" it seems hard to imagine the company wasn't ""doubling down"" on shares in July.The following comment is also important:Meaning ~400 M of the 604M came from a previous share repo authorization - leaving 1.3B available for future purchases. Therefore the 230M share estimate mentioned in the article may not be too far off as of July 25 -- it's only 13.6 M shares less than the company reported at June 30, and since the price was freakishly low during most of July -- it seems reasonable that at least part of the 13.6 M delta could have been taken back after June 30 - this gives rise to the possibility that the EPS figure based on the shares outstanding on July 25 may have been higher than that reported on the June 30th financial statements.The article continued with:andHere is an update from the Reuters July 26 article on the subject:The morning after the earnings release, there were no fewer than seven price-target hikes on the shares of WDC.The article went on to report the following:Now some 60 days later, Mr. Reitzes has changed his appraisal of the company again, this time by a full $6 per share or $1.5B, in a span of only 90 days, the opinion of value for WDC from this one analyst (not that he is alone) spanned from $32 to $49 per share -- a range of 4.3 B or ~ 56% of the company's enterprise value as of July 24th, 2012 - a remarkable and colorful range.As the article drew to a close the following was written:No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a vesselOf course we wouldn't miss any of the fun… so during the run up to the July 25 earnings announcement, we liquidated other positions (including Skechers (NYSE:SKX) conveniently sold at a ridiculously high return), brought in new investors, borrowed huge sums to lever up and continued to put basically unprecedented amounts of investor capital into a super concentrated position in WDC as indicated in the articles. Although our brokers complained loudly, and some might think there was sleepless nights -- in fact, not one iota of doubt existed.As it's been said:Here are the purchases made that the article referenced, as well as others made after publication along with performance data as of the writing of this article:Without the misunderstandings and (sometimes) miscalculations outlined above, as well as the commensurate time arbitrage opportunities they present, the whole operation Amvona is involved in might not be possible - that is to say the pursuit of at least ""slightly better than average"" returns for investors.For example, the WDC investment idea, which started last November, has produced an average annualized return (so far) of ~171% for investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
747341,21445,2012-07-25T11:41:38-04:00,,"Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is expected to report Q4 earnings after the market close on Wednesday, July 25, with a conference call scheduled for 5:00 pm ET. The consensus estimate is $2.47 for EPS and $4.25B for revenue, according to First Call. The company topped estimates last quarter, however, guidance was disappointing and management's comments indicated a softer demand outlook. Coming into the quarterly results, most analysts lowered HDD estimates for Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (WDC) due to continued weakness in the PC market. On its Q3 earnings call, Western Digital announced that the impact of the Thai flood was wearing off and that Hitachi's GST operations had been successfully integrated into the business as a subsidiary. Hence, the company sees plenty of upside opportunities for its business. For Q4, Western Digital guided revenue of $4.2B-$4.4B. TAM, or total available market, for the quarter is expected in the range of 155M-160M units. The company believes that there is sufficient capacity in the industry to support this demand. Together, R&D and SG&A spending are expected to be approximately $500M. The tax rate will be roughly 9%. Management also expects non-GAAP EPS of between $2.35-$2.55. Guidance is for Q4 capex of $357M and FY12 capex of approximately $750M. Management expects cost pressures to continue, which will be driven by rare earth materials, logistic costs, foreign currency exposure and underutilization of assets due to the lingering effect of the Thailand flood. Deutsche Bank expects Q4 results to be in-line with consensus, but believes guidance will be very conservative after Seagate's flat TAM commentary. The firm believes Street estimates on Western Digital also remain too high and expect guidance to be below consensus. The one potential positive not reflected, in Deutsche's view, is Western Digital's $1.5B stock buyback, which has the potential to add $1.00-$1.40 to FY13 EPS."
752131,24276,2012-07-26T12:58:26-04:00,,"Western Digital (WDC) stock popped today on the company's improved estimates for the full year and the belief that the company now enjoys ""duopoly"" status with Seagate in hard drives.The question investors should ask is, is this overdone?Assuming the company can meet its announced earnings target of $10/share, that would give it a forward PE of 4, with its present price of about $40. That's Ford-like.Seagate (STX) is up 12% in sympathy with WDC's improvement, again based on assumed duopoly status and the fading of the pain from last year's floods in Thailand.But there are reasons for caution:Investors who held WDC going into this month have done very well, and have a right to gloat. There may even be substantial upside to come, at least over the next year. But I would advise WDC, and its shareholders, to make hay while the sun shines, because there remain clouds on the demand horizon.Don't buy this stock, put it in a safe and ignore it.

862951,34101,2012-09-12T13:27:24-04:00,,"SanDisk (SNDK) is likely to benefit from strong demand for NAND flash memory product that is likely to exceed supply in the coming months. This could be seen from OCZ Technology (NASDAQ:OCZ) reducing its revenue outlook for the second quarter recently on short supply of NAND flash memory. This apart, technology bellwether Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) also will likely provide more details about its upcoming product releases' on September 12 to guide the NAND flash memory sector further.The news of OCZ Technology cutting its revenue forecast came after Toshiba slashed its NAND flash memory production by 30 percent from July 24. The production cut initiated by Toshiba is likely to intensify demand prospects for NAND flash memory. This is primarily due to robust demand for smartphone and tablet PCs. The typically seasonal second-half should stimulate higher demand. NAND flash memory is a component for media tablets, ultrabooks, smartphones and e-readers.The recent data suggest an improving supply and demand landscape is on the horizon. NAND flash memory prices for both spot as well as contracted have stabilized following the rationalization of supply from key producers. In a research note released on September 10, S&P Capital IQ analyst Angela Zina sees cyclical rebound in the group. ""We think demand is likely to exceed supply in the coming months, likely elevating supply constraints, which should aid pricing trends and lead to potential upward revisions to consensus earnings estimates,"" the analyst indicated.The analyst view is clearly demonstrated by OCZ Technology's preliminary results for the second quarter. The company's CEO Ryan Petersen comments hold significance. He said, ""Despite achieving bookings in excess of our expectations for our second fiscal quarter, we were not able to meet our previously stated revenue guidance due primarily to constraints in NAND flash supply."" Significantly, the company witnessed shortage of some NAND flash components during the month of August and expects it to continue as a result of production cuts by industry leaders.Interestingly, Samsung too indicated its intention to convert to the production of logic products from memory chips at its Austin, Texas facility. The production cuts by Toshiba and Samsung will reduce the inventory in the market thereby improving the overall balance of the supply/demand curve.More over, in the last one week or so, new product introductions were launched by the likes of Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Motorola (MOT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) thus supporting the demand side. Mobile phones consist of over 45 percent of the total NAND market bit share, according to S&P Capital IQ. This apart, Apple is set to launch its iPhone 5 on September 12. Analyst Zina believes that Apple is the single largest potential catalyst to drive the NAND flash market since it consumes 20 percent of total NAND flash and the company's forthcoming new product releases' could throw more light on the demand side of the NAND flash market.Additionally, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is planning to launch its Windows 8 and more smartphone and tablet products are also in the pipeline, analyst Zina viewed. The recent macroeconomic issues have also forced customers to hold back on rebuilding inventories during the first half. The second half is crucial because of the seasonality and this could provide opportunities for NAND flash memory producers to price its spot as well as contract aggressively.It appears that SanDisk is well positioned to gain from the available opportunity both within the client and enterprise solid state arena. The company strengthened its position in enterprise solid state drives or SSDs with the Schooner Information Technology buy in June, Flash Soft in February and Pliant Technology in May 2011. These acquisitions would help the company post significant revenue from SSD in the next few years.Meanwhile, S&P Capital IQ lifted its price target to $55 from $53 on P/E and price-to-sales metrics within historical and peer ranges. The analyst also increased operating EPS estimate for 2012 to $1.85 from $1.77. Zina added, ""We believe SNDK possesses the best balance sheet among pure based memory peers in our coverage universe, and think it is an ideal way to play the NAND flash market."" On the risk side, competitive pressures, more weakening in end market demand and price erosion could play a spoil sport.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

685631,31471,2012-06-26T19:04:37-04:00,,"I recently wrote about how Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) is a great buy in the hard drive sector of tech. Seagate has only one major competitor: Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC). Like Seagate, Western Digital is an attractive buy at current prices.Source: FreeStockCharts.comCompany Growth Prospects: ★★★★Western Digital is experiencing strong growth. Year over year EPS growth on a TTM basis is 19.72% and EPS growth on a same quarter year-on-year basis is 216.13%. Strong industry growth in emerging markets should drive continued growth. In the interests of continuing this growth, WD recently acquired HGST to expand their footprint.Western Digital has a solid technology pipeline, and is in the process of developing various new products, SSD-related and otherwise.Stock Valuation Overview: ★★★★★Key valuation metrics suggest Western Digital is substantially undervalued. The trailing P/E ratio, 5-yr PEG ratio, Price/Cash Flow ratio, Price/Sales ratio, and Price/Book ratio are all substantially below industry averages. Considering the S&P 500's 15.5x trailing P/E ratio, Western Digital's P/E ratio is absurdly low, especially considering the growth statistics I just outlined.Analyst/Investor Opinion: ★★★★★Western Digital has a very high 9.3/10 ""Bullish"" rating according to Starmine's Equity Summary Score. Analysts with outstanding ""Buy"" or ""Outperform"" ratings include Ford Equity Research, Standard and Poor's, EVA Dimensions, and Columbine Capital Services. Average analyst price targets start and $45 and head up to about $55, representing a 50-80% premium to current market price.Return Potential: ★★★★As reflected in the valuation section, Western Digital is substantially undervalued in terms of financial metrics. In terms of P/E ratio, the stock can stand to double and still look fairly inexpensive.In terms of total return, I prefer Seagate to Western Digital, mainly because of Seagate's dividend program. Seagate has a 5% dividend and is committed to maximizing shareholder value through dividend increases as well as stock buybacks. Western Digital, on the other hand, has no dividend. However, given the stock's relatively cheap valuation multiples, investors can still expect a solid return from price appreciation.Cautionary FactorsOne potential headwind to analyze before investing in any company in the hard drive industry is the rise of cloud computing. Western Digital derives a large percentage of revenue and earnings from consumer hard drives. As cloud computing comes into favor, large consumer hard drives and backup external hard drives may become less popular. While storage media will always be required somewhere (cloud computing still requires hard drives in servers), Western Digital may need to shift strategies in the future to adapt to changing market conditions.I believe Western Digital is moving in this direction already with products such as the My Book Live. On the server side, WDC has products as well, although reviews suggest Seagate may have an edge.Competitors and Related CompaniesSeagate is the only other major player in the hard drive sector. Seagate boasts similar valuation and growth stats to Western Digital, and a very attractive dividend. The lack of many major competitors gives Western Digital a good position, although my research suggests Seagate currently has the upper hand.Conclusion: Western Digital is a BuyI believe Western Digital is undervalued, although I personally prefer Seagate (see: Seagate Set To Shine.) Another quarter of strong earnings could spur a very sharp rally in Western Digital's stock.Disclosure: I am long STX. I may initiate a long position in WDC over the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: I am an individual investor, not a licensed investment advisor or broker dealer.

One can see a dramatic drop off in revenue, starting in Q4 and continuing with guidance for Q2.At SanDisk's 1st Quarter earning's conference call, SanDisk's CEO stated:Although Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is primarily a DRAM supplier, it does have a significant presence in the NAND memory market. At their earning's conference call on June 20th, Micron's management also echoed SanDisk's management.Unlike competitor Micron, SanDisk has been consistently profitable. Below is a look at the last nine quarters.ConclusionThe year 2012 looks like it will repeat the overall market pattern of 2011 and 2010. Because of this, SanDisk is definitely one stock that should be on your summer buy watch list.

The consensus estimate is 19c for EPS and $1.02B for revenue, according to First Call. Having missed estimates last quarter after beating forecasts in the prior two, SanDisk will look to right itself. SanDisk had warned last earnings report that too much supply and weaker demand would hurt Q2 quarter results. The company also said they saw possible additional inventory charges in Q2. Guidance for Q2 was for revenue approximately $1B, +/- $50M. SanDisk guided for a Q2 adjusted gross margin of approximately 28%, plus or minus two points. SanDisk saw FY12 revenue down from FY11 levels, capex at lower end of $1.1B-$1.6B range, and 1H12 cash flow negative and then turning positive in 2H12. SanDisk had said it would not re-start the ramp of Fab Five during 2012, but possibly in early 2013. Management saw 2012 as ""speed bump"" in terms of its growth trajectory. Stifel Nicolaus models for Q2 revenue to be in-line with management's revised guidance and slightly below the Street estimate of $1.02B. The firm is estimating 17c in non-GAAP EPS, which is below consensus. Despite the lowered guidance, Stifel expects SanDisk to report increasing exposure to OEM markets -- a positive. During the last earnings call, management stated their belief that the NAND flash market would recover in 2H, but with a softening PC market and weak global macroeconomic environment Stifel anticipates that management may push out expectations for market recovery to Q4. Stifel notes that NAND Flash spot prices have recently slowed their rate of decline, which may be viewed as a sign of market stabilization."

We estimate the SSD business will be the fastest-growing division for SanDisk due to the growing popularity of tablets, ultrabooks and smartphones which use SSD memory to improve performance and start-up time.See our full analysis on SanDiskFujitsu has selected SanDisk's 32GB iSSD memory device for its LifeBook line of ultrabooks. The iSSD technology coupled with Condusiv Technologies' ExpressCache software helps reduce system startup and application loading time, making ultrabooks faster and more responsive. SanDisk also said that Lenovo has chosen its 16GB U100 mSATA SSD for its new ThinkPad Edge E430 and E530 notebooks.We expect SSD to be the biggest growth market for SanDisk as the penetration of tablets and smartphones increases. We think the following factors will drive growth in coming years:1. TabletsA fast-growing tablet market will keep demand elevated for flash memory used as primary storage in devices. Solid state memory devices are the biggest contributor to SanDisk's stock, and we expect further growth in this segment. The company expects the average tablet storage memory capacity to grow to 71 GB by 2015 (source).2. The Ultrabook WaveUltrabooks are not built to use traditional hard disk drives and will adopt SSDs for primary storage. We expect the next generation notebooks and netbooks to follow suit, and this will further drive up demand for SSD chips. The average notebook storage memory capacity is projected to grow to 262 GB by 2015, according to SanDisk.3. SSD gaining popularityThough the initial outlay for a SSD chip is high, flash memory is cheaper to run, uses less power, is reliable and compact. It also processes faster and can manage more operations per second compared to legacy drives. This will lead to rising demand in SSD storage as more enterprises shift to flash storage as applications become more data-intensive and are deployed on the cloud.If ultrabook demand for SSD improves and SanDisk's market share in the segment increases by 5 percentage points from our estimate of ~19% to 24% by the end of our forecast period, we can expect around 5% upside to our price estimate. We estimate SanDisk's SSD memory division constitutes nearly 15% to the company value.We have a $45.50 Trefis price estimate for SanDisk, about ~30% above the current market price.Disclosure: No positions"

What will the company's earnings be in FQ4 with 12 weeks of HGST earnings?Barclays (BARC.L) boosted its target price on shares of Western Digital from $45.00 to $49.00 on April 30th, 2012.Exactly 4 weeks later:Barclays downgraded Western Digital Corp. from Overweight to Equalweight and lowered the PT from $49 to $37 with Analyst, Ben A. Reitzes, saying in part:A look at the specific language is interesting - take for example the following:Doesn't this comment refer to ""price"" of the shares in future time, an event Mr. Reitzes has precisely zero chance of knowing with any degree of accuracy? Wouldn't it be wiser to speak of the ""value"" of the company in terms of what can be known in future time with some approximate accuracy? Besides how is the term ""range-bound"" useful, if he does not tell us what the ""range"" is? for example, if the range is $35 (est. FQ4 book value) - $80 (low FQ4 13 intrinsic value estimate) per share it seems reasonable (after checking to make sure your health insurance is active), that if you don't have the cash, you might take out loans with your friendly neighborhood Mafiosi in order to buy shares of WDC at a 10:1 leverage ratio. Just to be clear your broker provides the leverage, not the initial loan - We understand the participants in this instance could be easily confused.Next Up:Could anything be more vague? The current quarter is the most tangible and immediate information available, yet, Reitzes is discarding those figures wholly in favor of ""certain developments"" which he does not clarify, and which etymologically must take place in an unknown future. These hypothetical events, in Reitzes own words will not affect the mysterious ""range"" of prices (not value) which we can only guess at, but only ""could impact guidance"" - but he does not clarify whose guidance, or how it will be impacted? He only provides a time frame for this exceedingly unfocused forecast, which is some six months into Amvona book value forecast which is based on actual figures.Finally this:This statement of course is anything but ""specific,"" for starters, if the news were to be ""neutral"" (one option provided), it most certainly would not have the same impact to ""the range"" as say ""negative"" news, which is ""specifically"" different. Further, the term ""PC flow"" is not described, nor is the relationship between ""PC flow"" and ""storage demand."" What we do know is that WDC functions to service ""Storage"" needs, not ""PC Flow,"" as evidenced in the CEO's own comments above.Then there is the very unspecific mention of ""inventories,"" but we have no clue whose inventories (e.g. component suppliers etc)? Finally there is ""secular concerns,"" one of our favorite terms because it almost sounds smart. According to Reitzes ""secular concerns"" constitutes ""Certain Developments"" approximately two quarters from now, a period of time when all we know is that the ""guidance"" might be impacted - we can find no way to reconcile the time frame mentioned in the opening remarks namely, ""the near term"" with ""secular"" (concerns) an adjective used to describe a long-term time frame, usually at least 10 years.Incredibly, the man in 44 words has accomplished what few others could, he has said absolutely nothing while still sounding impressive.The result is that Ben Reitzes' appraisal of the company changed by nearly 3 B when he lowered his price target from $49 per share (slightly above tangible equity projections in one year) to $37 per share (in one year) or approximately 18% below the equity projection, or a P/B ratio in one year of just .82 (or 68% less premium than WDC just paid for the smaller Hitachi (HIT) unit HGST.How can an opinion change so wildly in only 4 weeks? Do global economics really shift that quickly?Is it possible that Dell (DELL-OLD) sales (one of the events Reitzes appears to be referencing) slipped because it's Dell and has its own specific business model, and not because contraction in storage demand? Future Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices utilizing SSD for instance will still upload to the cloud - doesn't matter how many tablets or ultra books are sold, especially since many ultrabooks will likely still have HDD's - both are designed to have paid subscriptions to iCloud, which might as well be called iWDC.The FutureIt appears clear that WDC intends to be a major player in the ultrabook market, unfortunately they've partnered with a small concern which nobody apparently has heard of, it's a little company called Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) which recently announced collaboration on a new 5 MM drive specifically for ultrabooks - this appears to be what Coyne was referencing in his press release on HGST above.A 10k rpm, 5 mm hybrid HDD in a 2.5"" form factor is right around the corner. Such a device seems very appealing from a technology/cost standpoint in reference to SSDs. Its life span will probably exceed that of SDDs and its price will likely still be ~1/10 that of SSDs when they come to market. Given that Intel is invested in this technology, WDC leadership position, and the fact that SSDs only have 4% market penetration, there seems plenty of ""runway"" for WDC to continue to transition its business to whatever new technology will meet future storage needs best.The CEO of Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) when asked about the possibility of SSD taking market share in the aftermath of the Thai floods had this to say:According to Cisco's IP traffic forecast mobile traffic is forecast to grow 18x from 2011 to 2016 - a positive for vendors with strong mobile networking exposure. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) also sees over half of all 2016 traffic coming from Wi-Fi networks, and expects the number of global Internet users, boosted by smart phone adoption, to reach 3.4B (up from 1.9B in 2010) - that's a CAGR of 29% in the next 4 years to 1.3 zettabytes, or the equivalent of 38M DVDs per hour. By comparison, IP traffic from 1984-2012 was a mere 1.2 zettabytes.A few highlightsMr. Zuckerberg is right. It is very important to look after the interests of investors. After all investors hand over their wealth in a sacred act of trust. The idea is a simple one and quite old - the manager should use their ""talents"" to return a larger figure than was originally deposited. Being aggressive is fine, so long as it is done wisely, and truly with the investors best interests in mind and not the managers.It is important to be open and specific on this point and to avoid any discussion that involves confusing language or motives, or subtle contradictions that might confuse. It would also be nice if the manager can accomplish the task somewhere in the span of a life time - 365 days for example would be good. For this reason, between Friday June 1st and Tuesday June 12th, 2012 we continued to plow huge sums of investors' capital into the shares of WDC (at around $30 per share) as we continued to build what was already a large stake in the company.Time will tell if it beats an investment in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

A volatile revenue stream, accompanied by a high fixed cost business with plenty of operating leverage, can get ugly when conditions align against SNDK such as what happened in the first quarter, when average selling prices (ASPs) fell 22% in q1, while bit growth fell 4%.Earnings estimates can rise and fall sharply, resulting in a volatile stock price.The question I'm sure every reader is asking is: Have Sandisk and the semi sector bottomed? Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) technical action today was quite good given the downside revenue guidance, as Intel rose 3% on double average volume.Another hint around the semis was that Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) warned early last week, lowering guidance for this current quarter (AMAT reports in mid-August) and the stock didn't suffer much technical damage.However, we'll focus on SNDK, and with book value and tangible book value being $28 and $27 respectively, in our opinion the stock is getting close to a trough valuation.The trend in consensus earnings estimates for 2012 and 2013 have been sharply downward:q3 '11 $4.97 and $5.50q4 '11 $4.71 and $5.56q1 '12 $2.02 and $3.14q2 '12 $1.82 and $3.12 (as of Wednesday, July 18)Readers can readily see the damage caused by the April '12 earnings and the stock price reacted accordingly. That being said, analysts are expecting almost a doubling of earnings next year (71% to be exact) so the stock could be trading now off the 2013 eps estimate.SNDK is now a supplier of NAND flash to all smartphone makers, which means SNDK is finally into Apple as a supplier.Using the March 31 financials, SNDK is trading at 1.25(x) enterprise value to sales, and 10(x) enterprise value to cash-flow, however, the biggest catalyst for SNDK would be an improvement in ASPs and bit growth, which would start to push earnings estimates higher.We typically don't add to positions in front of earnings, but rather prefer to wait until we see results. Technically, SNDK is sitting on it's 200-week moving average, and is heavily oversold.Technically, heavily oversold, near a trough valuation and now with other semi companies starting to perk up, we are waiting on the 2nd half of 2012 for SanDisk.Disclosure: I am long SNDK."
676671,21815,2012-06-21T21:10:37-04:00,,"The venerable hard-disk drive for data storage in servers, PCs and laptops (and the odd iPod) are going to go the same way as the dodo. They'll be largely defunct pretty soon (although how soon turns out to be something of a critical question). The reason for that is rather simple.Hard disks are mechanical devices. That brings a host of disadvantages. They need a good deal of energy, they're vulnerable to shocks and damage, they're not subject to Moore's law (despite having shown similar if not better improvement in the last decade or so, it has to be said).And there is another curious reason. Their main advantage, capacity, is outgrowing the usefulness of at least a significant part of the users (those with laptops and PCs).What is replacing hard disks? Solid State Drives (SSDs), which are comprised of flash memory, a non-volatile type of memory (that it, just like hard disks, but unlike RAM memory, retaining data when the current is cut off). Compared to hard disks, SSDs are an order of magnitude faster, more robust, and more energy efficient. And they are also rapidly improving and coming down in price.This is why the hard-disk industry has seen a great deal of consolidation, and the SSD sector has seen a great deal of expansion, with new players joining in, driving performance and prices ever higher. The hard-disk industry used to be very competitive, with players like IBM (NYSE:IBM), Maxtor, Conner and Fujitsu (OTCPK:FJTSY), which all left the field.Even as little ago as last year, there were still five players in the hard-disk sector, Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), Hitachi (OTCPK:HTHIY) and Toshiba (OTC:TSHTF). But Seagate bought Samsung's hard-disk business and Western Digital and Toshiba divided Hitachi's. Since Toshiba is quite small, it's effectively Seagate and Western Digital dominating the market.There are a couple of offsetting forces at work here. Longer-term, we have little doubt that SSDs, which are already eating into the hard-disk business, will dominate as they get cheaper, faster, more energy efficient and capacities surge. However, in the short run, hard disks are profiting from movement to the cloud and from very intensive data storage like video streaming.One should also realize that the consolidation in the industry has reduced competition. This became pretty obvious in the aftermath of the Thai flooding. Here is Seagate CEO Steve Luczo:And here is the Inquirer weighing in:We would think that, longer-term, even the server market will be gradually taken over by SSDs. Not just the speed and reliability, but more especially the energy efficiency gives them a significant leg up, and when they gradually overcome their capacity/price disadvantage, these advantages will assert themselves with considerable force.So what we have in the near-term is very profitable companies, and they are very cheap as well, so it's tempting to buy them.Western DigitalA nice 'pure play' hard-disk company. Some company metrics (from Yahoo):As you can see, the company fell sharply from the end of last month's $40+ level, back towards the $30 level today. But those floods, how much did they affect the figures?Yes, indeed, the shares can be considered very cheap. Analysts on average expect the company to produce a whopping $7.66 per share in earnings this fiscal year, and this will rise to $9.09 next fiscal year [Yahoo], giving them a forward price-earnings ratio of just over 3.In fact, Seagate is even cheaper. Analysts expect profit per share on average of $9.46 next year (ending June 2013), which would give it a forward p/e of 2.5.Buying these companies simply becomes a bet on the speed of the transition from hard disks to SSDs. Apparently, analysts, on average, do not see a speedy transition. Revenues for STX are expected to rise from $15.4B this fiscal year, to $19.4B the next. A similar rise is expected for Western Digital's revenues.The last four quarter in profits have been astounding at Seagate:Difficult to argue that this Thai flood has done them any harm.. So for the foreseeable future, these stocks seem extremely cheap and good profit machines. But we know the party won't last. The shock will come in leaps and bounds, as a reaction of increases in performance and price falls of SSDs that will take customers away.Can these companies use the cash generated in their profitable hard-disk business to transform into something else? That's a fair question. These kind of transitions, like the legendary transition of Nokia from paper to mobile phone giant, are quite rare. Both companies have made some feeble attempts to get into the SSD business, or the home network (and here) business (good for data storage as well, needless to say).But we're not that optimistic. Capabilities are the DNA of companies, and those of the hard-disk business are quite specific to that technology (magnetic storage). They either have to find a field where these capabilities can be applied with equal success, or develop (or buy) new capabilities.Betting on SSDs then? Well, that field is quite fragmented (although we like OZC), but even flash memory (on which these are based) might be superseded in the not so distant future.One can ride these stocks for a while, but not too long.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Hitachi (HIT) paid IBM (NYSE:IBM) US $2.05 billion for its HDD business.In March 2012 Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) acquired HGST, for $4.8 billion, (~400 M more in cash than was originally announced on March 7th of 2011), with HGST operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of Western Digital for the short-term.When Hitachi sold its HDD unit to WDC they booked a 2.4 B profit as a result of the transaction and took the 10% of WDC that they agreed to when the merger was first announced on March 11th, 2011.According to the press release:andAs of May 4th, and the company's 10Q filing with the SEC, WDC had taken back approximately 9 M shares in the 9 days following the earnings release - the number of shares outstanding at that time was 260 M.Effectively, HGST was willing to pay $30 per share for the company when its financial profile looked much different. For example, at the time Hitachi signed up for the deal, 10% of WD represented about 750M equity stake, but the tangible equity in the company at the time, was much smaller (WDC had virtually no intangible or goodwill items on its own books). Today it represents about the same, only the assets of HGST are included (virtually 100% of the intangibles on WDC's books are those of HGST), and the market outlook is much stronger.It is also interesting to note that between March 7th or 2011 when the merger was first announced and the closing of the deal about a year later, the cash part of the deal increased by 400M or 11.4%. This must mean that HIT's value increased by at least a commensurate amount during the time frame when the transaction was delayed for regulatory concerns. Could the additional 400M in value be attributable to HIT's long term agreements (LTAs)?The transaction also indicates that HIT recognized at least a 50% premium over book in WDC in March 2011 (even if its stock wasn't trading at that) and when the company was much smaller (smaller revenues, profits and less the HGST bolt-on), because they were taking 10% of a future combined company which did include 2B in intangible just for HGST (the smaller of the two concerns).The 1.5 B repo announced on May 21 has the possibility to take back as many as 50 M shares at the closing price of $30.11 on June 1st, 2011 (when this article was written), or a full 20% of the shares outstanding as of May 4th, 2012, effectively increasing the pro rata share for HIT to 12% of the business. The same effect would be true of course for all owners of WDC shares.The new WD will operate with WD Technologies and HGST as wholly-owned subsidiaries. Aggregate revenues of the two companies in 2011 were $15 billion. A projection of 18B for FY 2013 doesn't seem unreasonable.Everybody RunOn September 17th, of 2010 the article ""640K ought to be enough for anybody…"" WDC vs. STX was published after analysts' comments prompted a sell off in the shares of HDD manufacturers when it became evident that tablets would be popular. Amvona had a position on tablet computing that went back to January 28th, of 2010 when the article ""Would the Pope buy an iPad?"" was published, and the follow up published on August 26th, 2010 entitled simply ""Update: It turns out the answer is Yes!""In could be said that the analysts' theories about HDDs at the time (late 2010) could be summarized in only seven words: ""On the count of three everybody run"" - it's the sort of thing value investors like, especially when most didn't even wait till two.The Amvona articles although affirming the potential of tablets as early as January 2010, did not agree with the thesis that it would spell the end for HDDs. On August 10th, of 2011 the results of that disagreement were published in the article ""Update: ""640K ought to be enough for anybody…"" WDC vs. STX.""Now about two years after the original article was published, analysts are still using the same story to spook investors out of the shares of HDD manufacturers. Nonetheless in an HDD world that seems to be falling apart (part deux), why not look to Book Value and the balance sheet for security? The earnings coefficient is a moving target after all - but one of course that the market prefers, unless investors gets a little skittish (not that they ever would). This is evidenced in the fact that Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), despite having a lower P/E ratio has recently fallen faster than WDC - the answer may lie in the premium over book. Until recently STX was trading at about a 3x premium over assets, while WD was around 1.5 x. Further STX P/E ratio was only lower than that of WDC because of its superior position coming out of the Thai floods, and not because they are a better run company, on the contrary WDC has historically operated on higher margins, and presumably will return to that position. So the P/E factor, again is temporary and plastic, with STX's evident lead, only temporary, which leaves the more stable, tangible, truer and slower moving balance sheet coefficient - the price to book to ratio.Of the 4.8 B paid for HGST, 2.4 B was booked by HIT as ""profit"" as stated above, this is approximately the same figure WDC then added to the company balance sheet in the ""Goodwill"" and ""Intangibles"" lines after the acquisition closed. Any amount over tangible equity that a company pays for another company must be booked to these accounts.If a similar premium was used to book WDC's intangibles based on the HGST transaction (the most recent and relevant comparable data), the entry would be about 5 B - this is a rational calculation of real equity in WDC whic is not on ""the books.""Hitachi was a smaller company than WDC in every respect (with about half the revenue of WDC in 2011) at the time of the acquisition.The market rewards scale. For this reason, larger concerns command a higher premium to book or equity.It is interesting to note that in March of 2011 when HDD pricing was not so benign, but rather declining, that HGST a company only half the size of WDC was valued at a 50% premium to book, in the same way HIT viewed WDC, except HIT may have appreciated the missing intangibles (arguably ~5B) on WDC's books.We know at least something about how HIT valued WDC because of the share component of the transaction. Presently HDD pricing is much more favorable to manufacturers, and although it has come down somewhat since the floods in Thailand, it remains approximately 70% above pre-flood levels, where prices appears set to stay.The total addressable market continues to climb as well, and is expected to exceed that which existed in March of 2011. In addition the competitive landscape has shrunk from 5 to 2 players after the acquisition of Samsung's and LaCie's hard drive businesses by Seagate Technologies. Toshiba still exists and now has the former HGST's 3.5"" mfg. capacity, but the Toshiba operation is too small to have a material impact, and the future of the 3.5"" form factor to dim to be considered a ""competitor.""Yet, as of close of market on June 1st, 2012 shares in WDC could effectively be purchased for less than book value alone. Although it appears that at the closing price of $30.11 there is a 6% premium over book, this is not accurate, because 2 months into the quarter the company would have already earned at least 435 M, which would have increased shareholder equity to 7.9 B or $30.38 per share at 260 M shares. However, if the share count were say, 230 M in the period ending June 30th, 2012 (given the repo), and the equity 8.1 B (660 M in FQ4 earnings) the book value per share would be approximately $35.29. this scenario is exceedingly likely, and if correct means that the buyer on June 1st, was actually paying closer to .85 x book for the shares - with the vast majority of that value purely tangible.Here are the figures in chart form:Here is a look at the growth in per share book value for WDC in recent years:The aggregate growth rate in per share book value has been approximately 33% since 2007. The FQ4 estimate, with reduced share count puts book value at $35.29. The one year estimate at the same share count puts book value at $45.36. This is also the recent one year price target suggested by Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) Analyst Scott Craig who thinks WDC in one year should be worth no more than just its equity, which is nearly all tangible - meaning the company (with its 40+ year operating history) would be worth nothing as a going concern - or 50% less (premium to book) than HIT thought the firm was worth 15 months earlier on March 7th, 2011.If the shares traded at just a 50% premium to book in one year, which is what HGST sold for despite being a much smaller company in a less favorable environment, the shares would be worth $68 per share in one year's time. However, STX which is also a smaller company and historically not as well run, recently sold for over ~3.6 x book. Even after the recent market rout, STX still sold recently for 2.76 x book. If WDC, as a larger and potentially much more profitable company sold for just half of what STX was trading for just three weeks ago, the shares would be valued at almost $80 per share. It is likely that the reason the market is not noticing this, is because of a focus on the price-to-earnings ratio, for which STX has a better showing. However, what is also likely, is that the market is over looking the fact that for two of the last four quarters the earnings of WDC were impaired by the Thai floods to a far greater extent than the operations of STX - so STX's superior P/E showing over WDC is only temporary, and not the historical norm.Analyst ErrorsOn May 1st, 2012 the article Silver Platters, Annie Oakley and ""The Sidelines"" was published. The article pointed to what appeared to be a remarkable error in earnings estimates for WDC by Bank of America Analyst Scott Craig in his research report on April 27th, 2012. Even more remarkable was a follow up comment made by Bank of America on May 22nd, 2012 - one day after WDC announced a 1.5 B repo. program - which makes yet another error when it overstates the size of the repo. by about 27%.Strategic concernsRecently the CEO of WDC John Coyne had the following to say about the HGST acquisition:Interestingly, nowhere is ""PCs"" or ""PC flow"" mentioned.Logical ErrorsHere are the supposed concerns of analysts which echo the same concerns raised in Q1 of 2010:Neither is actually a concern for HDD manufacturers because:According to Richard Rutledge, SVP of Marketing at WDC:and on SDD Rutledge had this to say:Analysts also indicate that they are worried about future of HDD pricing - but the comment that ignited the initial sell off in WDC shares had to do with LTAs (see Silver Platters, Annie Oakley and ""The Sidelines"") - which is a contradiction, because Long Term Agreements ""lock-in"" pricing (in some cases for up to two years), such that they are no longer fluid. Those LTA are ""seriously accretive"" according to WDC. STX has LTAs as well and indicated that pricing was ""benign"" in the latest CC. There are three factors working against further price declines:1. The new Duopoly2. Long term agreements (LTAs)3. The growth in demand generated by enterprise storage (The Cloud)Continue to part 3.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

A married put position may be entered by purchasing a put option against a stock in order to protect the stock in case the stock price drops significantly.The married put position was closed and replaced with a bull-put credit spread in order to recover from the loss on the married put. A bull-put credit spread may be entered for a net credit by selling one put option and purchasing a second put option further out-of-the-money with the goal of the options expiring worthless and the initial net credit retained as profit. The stock price of SanDisk has continued to drop, and the bull-put credit spread position has continued to be rolled in response.In the most recent article, the bull-put credit spread was rolled to a 2012 Oct 28/31 put spread. A management price for the position was set for $32.25. The price of SanDisk's stock has breached the management point, so consideration for exiting or rolling the position is given.To exit the current 2012 Oct 28/31 put spread will require a net debit of $1.22 as shown below:(Click to enlarge)The aggregate amount of credit received so far from the series of bull-put credit positions is $0.53 which is less than $1.22, so to close the current position would result in a loss of $0.69 which represents a loss of about - 23%. Closing the current position is not very attractive, so consideration for rolling the position is given.Rolling at this point is still an attractive idea, as the current stock price is near the last major support level for the company as shown below:(Click to enlarge)Additionally, in SanDisk's presentation at the JPMorgan TMT Conference held on May 17, 2012, the company had good things to say about new initiatives being worked on which should be positive for the company in the coming months. As an example, the company is working on a multi-chip device which contains flash memory and dynamic memory which should be attractive for some of the company's large OEM customers.Additionally, the majority of the company's products will transition to 19nm by the end of the year which should give SanDisk a competitive advantage related to price as compared to many of its competitors.Based on this, rolling is a viable strategy. However, there aren't any stock options available for SanDisk for November or December, and there isn't an available option to roll to for 2012 Jan either. Typically, there's not much to roll to more than six months out in the future.In light of this, consideration will be given for adding additional capital in order to rescue the position. Spread traders should always keep a reserve of capital or positions which can be closed in order to rescue a position.Using PowerOptions tools, it is observed that the 2012 Oct 24/29 put spread can be entered for a net credit of $1.48 as shown below:(Click to enlarge)The 2012 Oct 25/30 put spread is also a viable candidate, as it can be entered for a net credit of $1.64, however, the margin between the stock price and the short strike of the put option is 5.2% whereas the 2012 Oct 24/29's margin is 8.4%.Rolling from the 2012 Oct 28/31 to the 2012 Oct 25/29 represents an increase in the capital requirement of 67%. The net credit from performing the roll is $0.24 ($1.48-$1.22) which results in a total net credit for the series of bull-put credit spreads of $0.77, representing a potential return of 16% which is inline with the 17.9% potential return of the previous position, yet has an increased margin between the stock price and the strike price of the short put option, putting the investment in a safer position, albeit with more capital at risk.A new management point is set for the new position of $30.25. If the price of the stock drops below $30.25, the position should be managed for an exit or a roll.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
642791,23255,2012-06-07T02:11:47-04:00,,"Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) is one of the three large hard disk drive (""HDD"") companies that command the magnetic disk market. Magnetic discs are the primary storage medium for digital media and are used in computers, data centers, and other storage devices. If you examine the industry further you will see that Western Digital and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) have an effective duopoly whereby the two firms command an 84% marketshare at the end of 2011. Western Digital was the market leader with a 47% share that was held-back by the Thailand flooding. Now that the industry has sufficiently consolidated you will see fewer price wars and both Western Digital and Seagate should benefit.Source: Yahoo! FinanceThere are continued fears that HDDs will become obsolete as consumers are increasingly switching to flash memory devices that provide the storage for devices such as Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. These concerns are far overstated because there is a limited supply of flash memory which causes it to be quite expensive compared to HDDs. Make no mistake, I am not implying that your next iPhone or iPad will have a HDD but HDDs are still a critical part of our technology ecosystem. In an interview with Seagate CEO Steve Luczo, Eric Savitz explains why HDDs are not going to lose relevance anytime soon:This explosion in data usage is reflective of our increasingly online society that generates an unprecedented amount of digital content ranging from pictures to videos to software that consumers want to share with each other. Every time you take a picture on your iPhone and upload it to Facebook you just increased the amount of data that both Apple and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) must store. If you then send those same pictures via Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Gmail or backed up those pictures to Dropbox, you helped to create an even larger digital burden. The ""cloud"" is nothing but massive data centers and both Google and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) provide coherent overviews of how the services work. Per WDC's 2011 10-K, Last week the stock broke below its 200 day moving average of $33.26 after Barclays analyst Ben Reitzes downgraded both Western Digital and Seagate to Equal Weight due to weak PC demand. Mr. Reitzes is concerned about a lowering of guidance later this year but I still contend that this is a strong long-term play. This is quickly becoming less of a PC component play and more of a digital storage play as indicated above. Despite the downgrade, Barclays maintains a $37 price target which is approximately twenty percent below where the stock is currently trading. WDC is now virtually flat on the year after tumbling twenty percent in the last month.From a financial standpoint Western Digital is one of the most attractive companies I follow and it is apparent to me that the fears surrounding this company are far overstated. The financial metrics below are staggering as you have a highly liquid company trading at a 3.2 forward P/E and .4 PEG. Not only does the company have minimal debt but it is currently paying 1.44% on its loan facility that expires in February 2013. There is some refinancing risk but it is very minimal given the company's strong financial condition.Perhaps most surprising about WDC is that it is currently trading at $30 and has $13 per share in cash. The 2.3 price-to-cash ratio is another way of saying that approximately 40% of Western Digital's market price is represented by cash - let that settle in. Additionally, Hitachi is the largest shareholder with 25 million shares, or 9.6% of the company as a result of Western Digital's $4.8 billion acquisition of the hard disk drive business last year. This should help to further stabilize the stock and strengthen the downside protection.To sum up, you have a company with strong growth prospects trading at a depressed multiple and a strong cash stockpile to offer downside protection.Source: Finviz.comIf the catalysts discussed above and attractive valuation are not enough to perk your interest then you might went to read Western Digital's press release from last week regarding share repurchases. The company plans to repurchase an additional $1.5B of stock as CEO John Coyne stated, ""we believe that Western Digital's stock is a compelling investment based on our ability to create additional value for our customers and shareholders in the growth markets we serve."" With a $7.8B market capitalization this means that Western Digital is prepared to repurchase almost twenty percent of the company. This follows $334B (per 2011 10-K) in repurchases from 2005 through July 2011 as management continues to take advantage of the attractive stock price. For reference, Apple announced a share repurchase plan earlier in 2012 to repurchase $10B over a three year period. To provide a rough approximation of the scale of the repurchase, this would be similar to Apple repurchasing approximately $100B of its outstanding stock.Both Western Digital and Seagate are strong companies that are attractively valued and I personally chose Western Digital due to its larger market share and cash stockpile; however, Seagate is cheaper and offers a very healthy 4.5% dividend yield. Seagate also trades a 2.5 forward P/E and one of the deciding factors for me was that Seagate has appreciated 47% in 2012 while Western Digital is flat year-to-date.Disclosure: I am long AAPL, GOOG, FB, WDC."
604611,24199,2012-05-21T07:10:14-04:00,,"SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) is a global  leader in flash memory storage products. The company sells a variety of  such items, including USB flash drives and other portable media [e.g.  SD, MicroSD, Compact Flash), embedded memory for mobile phones and  tablets as well as a range of high end solid state drives (SSD)] used in  laptops, desktop PCs and network servers. The company pioneered (solely  or in partnership with other market leaders) many of these technologies  and has a sizable patent portfolio that has generated $1.15 billion in  licensing revenue over the last three years (covering much of the $1.35  billion the company spent on R&D over the period!).There are a lot of things to like about SNDK. Perhaps most notable is  its solid capital structure with $3.84 billion in net cash which  comprises 45% of its market cap, resulting in an EV of about $5 billion.  On this basis, the company has generated average free cash flow over  the last three years of around $800 million, for a yield greater than  16%. Furthermore, the company has experienced significant growth, with  2011 revenues 45% higher than five years prior (7.7% CAGR: not bad for a  recession!).At the time of writing, the company’s stock is down 26% YTD as a  result of a weak first quarter and poor forecast for the second quarter.  When I see a company with solid historical performance collapse in  price as a result of one bad quarter, I investigate to see whether this  is a temporary anomaly that might present a good value opportunity.So what happened in Q1? Checking the company’s earnings press release,  we see a slight decline in revenues and pretty significant gross margin  contraction. The president and CEO had this to say on the conference call:Let’s take the second factor first. SNDK has little to no exposure to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),  and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) (the largest mobile manufacturer) only accounts for 10% of  SNDK’s sales. So the bulk of SNDK’s revenues from mobile OEMs are from  players outside the top tier. Industry dynamics have been forcing the  (distant) second tier to cut prices dramatically in order to compete  with the top tier. The result is that these manufacturers are no longer  bundling microSD cards with their phones, which means consumers then  have to buy cards on their own. These sales would logically be higher  than the bulk sales to OEMs, but not all of these purchases will buy  microSD cards and many may buy from SNDK’s competitors (from my check of  various retailer websites, SNDK appeared to be priced significantly  higher than its competitors). Note also that SNDK executives stressed in  the conference call that the company has several products being tested  by the top OEMs (read AAPL) for implementation later this year which  should help SNDK’s mobile sales.The bigger issue is the first: a “greater-than-expected price  decline.” In some industries, this is the result of a one-time  phenomenon that leads to short-term pain as companies digest oversupply  and atone for overly optimistic past projections. Unfortunately, this is  not one of those industries. You see, SNDK and its competitors are  trapped on a rapidly moving treadmill that requires all parties to bring  their costs down at an ever increasing rate in order to maintain  profitability (hence the “expected” decline). From the company’s 10-k:On one hand, the competition to bring prices down is good in that it  will drive the transition from traditional HDDs to SSDs and open up the  industry to a much larger audience. On the other hand, a bet on SNDK (or  any of its competitors) is really a bet on its ability to reduce its  costs per gigabyte faster than the price decline per gigabyte. In a  perfectly competitive environment, the company with the lowest marginal  production cost sets the price and drives down the profitability of all  the other players (before we rush to assume perfect competition, note  that industry participants are subject to a number of ongoing class  action lawsuits alleging price fixing – see Note 16. Litigation). So SNDK is constantly striving to have a lower cost base than its competitors, which will allow it to set the price.There are a few things to be worried about here. First, whenever  industry competition is based largely on price there is a significant  risk created as marginal competitors are driven from the industry. These  competitors dump their products and try all sorts of wild and  unpredictable things as they attempt to stay alive, often upsetting  (even if just for a short time) industry economics.Second, the effort to reduce costs is expensive in itself. Here we  see that SNDK has spent 20% of its Enterprise Value over the last three  years just on R&D in an attempt to achieve a lower cost per gigabyte  than its competitors.Third, the drive to lower costs often leads to commitments that would  not normally be desirable. For example, the surest way to lower costs  is to work toward a more fixed cost basis and then attempt to ramp up  units sold, achieving increasing economies of scale. This is known as  operating leverage and increasing it has been SNDK’s strategy:While the company does have some non-captive manufacturing in which  it has some swing capacity via third party manufacturers, the bulk of  its product is done in-house through a joint venture with Toshiba.It is important to note that operating leverage, like financial  leverage, cuts both ways, so as demand declines those fixed costs remain  the same and losses begin to mount. So SNDK’s strategy of increasing  operating leverage in order to achieve greater marginal profitability is  increasingly risky as the company is relatively worse off during times  of lower demand. From a review of the company’s recent 10-Ks, we see  that it has been continuously increasing its investment in these joint  ventures in order to maintain its cost advantage. Like a company that  continuously increases its financial leverage, investors should find a  company that continuously increases its operating leverage to be highly  risky and thus unattractive.There are other negative consequences of this strategy. As I  mentioned, the company has a joint venture with Toshiba for  manufacturing in Japan. The arrangement is that both SNDK and Toshiba  purchase 50% of the manufacturing output of the JV at the cost of  production plus a given markup. The problem is that sales are largely in  USD while manufacturing costs are incurred in Japanese Yen, which  has gained 46%  over the last five years. This acts as a drag on the company’s  performance (the company does utilize hedges, but this only delays the  ultimate reckoning when there is a clear long-term trend in currency  exchange rates). Unfortunately, this is not the biggest problem.The larger issue with these joint venture arrangements it that they  are structured as variable interest entities (VIEs) in which the company  owns just a hair under 50%, giving Toshiba control. First, as a VIE,  SNDK has been able to push obligations it has on behalf of the VIE off  its balance sheet, understating its liabilities. Here’s what the company  says about these guarantees (emphasis added):Thus, investors need to account for the fact that there are  significant off balance sheet liabilities related to its manufacturing  operations.The other issue with this structure is that, when a company does not  have control over its subsidiary (either owning more than 50% or via  contractual arrangement), it accounts for the subsidiary via the equity  method rather than the consolidation method. Under the consolidation  method, we would see all of the JV’s liabilities, assets, revenues and  expenses show up on SNDK’s financial statements, with a minority  interest line deducting the portion attributable to Toshiba. This would  more accurately represent the true cost structure of SNDK. Instead, SNDK  uses the equity method, which means that only its share of the (meager)  profits of the JV shows up on its income statement and only its portion  of the equity in the JV shows up on the balance sheet. The effect of  this is that profitability appears greater and leverage appears lower.So there are a few things here that leave me unhappy with SNDK’s  decisions regarding how it reports financials, all stemming from its JV  with Toshiba. On its own, I wouldn’t be as worried because we can adjust  the financial statements to be more representative. But the larger  issue is that SNDK operates in an industry with unattractive economics  that create incentives to increase operating leverage, which increases  risk.I’ve tried to make the case here that, while the company has  performed well over the last few years thanks to its captive  manufacturing and economies of scale, investors today are reliant on the  good times continuing. If declining demand for the company’s products  persists, the double edged sword of operating leverage will come back to  sting investors. The rapid decline in gross margins this past quarter  is a testament to how quickly things can change. Consequently, I would  have to see the share price fall much further in order to get  interested.Oh, one more thing. The company has a shareholder rights plan to  entrench management and directors at the expense of shareholders. I hate  that, and so should you."
579471,24088,2012-05-10T17:10:25-04:00,,"Ever since its April 19th earnings report, SanDisk (SNDK) stock price has plunged on concerns due to lower earnings guidance. This guidance has been triggered by the plunge in the price of flash memory drives on the open market. Despite the risks of commodization of flash memory drives, the 28% sell off since April has made SanDisk undervalued on both a fundamental and technical basis. As a result, I believe that SanDisk is a long term buy.Fundamentally, the April sell-off of SanDisk has overshot to the downside the impact of bad guidance. Prices of NAND flash data has fallen, but the demand for flash data is still high. Sales of smart phones are tablets are still growing and further growth from emerging market consumers can boost additional need for flash memory. With continuous technological improvements of flash memory and solid state drives, their uses are growing outside of mobile devices at the expense of traditional hard drives. SanDisk can use this trend to eat away market shares from hard drive makers such as Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) in the long run.On a valuation side, SanDisk is cheap. It's forward P/E has plunged from 18 to 11 in the past month. On a growth basis, the stock is at a good value with a PEG ratio of just 0.67. Even with the recent plunge in earnings, the company's operating and profit margins exceed 15% and 10% which double industry averages.Click to enlarge.Technically, SanDisk is brutally oversold. Its 14 day RSI measures at an oversold level of 27 and an upward break above 20 (though still low at 26) of the stock's full stochastics. The stock has formed a double bottom formation at slightly below $35 per share and has just bounced off its lower Bollinger Band. A bullish MAC-D in a bearish market environment is also a bullish divergence for SanDisk.Overall, the recent sell off of SanDisk is overblown has created a buying opportunity for the stock. The growing demand of for mobile devices and the gradual replacement of traditional hard drives with solid state drives are long term bullish catalysts for the company. The stock is falling knife and may fall more if the market continues its current retreat, but at this point the long run (over one year) upside reward outweighs downside risk.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in SNDK over the next 72 hours."
573821,25036,2012-05-09T12:51:20-04:00,,"A collar or protected covered call search performed using our tools seeking to find the highest returning position with a maximum potential loss of 8% for profitable value companies with a stock price in an uptrend produced the computer storage company Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) at the top of the list as shown below:Following closely behind Western Digital were insurance company American International Group (NYSE:AIG), engineering and construction contractor Foster Wheeler (FWLT), managed care services company Wellcare Health Plans (NYSE:WCG) and machinery company Terex (NYSE:TEX).A protected covered call is an income generating option strategy where a call option is sold against a stock with some of the proceeds from selling the call option used to purchase a protective put option. The 8% maximum loss parameter was selected for the search, as a loss of 8% or less can often be recovered fairly quickly using option income generating strategies. A search parameter for Price-to-Sales (P/S) of less than one was used to include value companies in the search. Profitable companies were included in the search by selecting the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) parameter greater than zero. Companies with a stock price in an uptrend were found by searching for stocks having a 100 day moving average greater than the 200 day moving average.In a previous article related to Western Digital, a protected covered call was considered, similar to the one mentioned in this article, which involved selling a 2012 Apr 41 call option, and purchasing a 2012 Apr 37 put option. At option expiration in April of 2012, the price of Western Digital's stock closed at $41.44 and was above the $41 strike price of the call option, so the Western Digital stock would have been assigned or called away. A graph of Western Digital's stock price is shown below:A long position in Western Digital's stock over the same time period as considered for the protected covered call of the previous article would have returned a very small profit of $0.02 (before brokerage fees/commissions). On the other hand, the protected covered call noted in the previous article would have returned 2.8% (44.4% annualized). The protected covered call from the previous article was also protected from a large loss for a stock price below the $37 strike price of the put option.Western Digital has not been in the news very much of late, and there wasn't any earth shattering news revealed in the company's Q3 2012 earnings call held on April 26, 2012. As a result, the outlook for the company remains neutral to bullish which is conducive for a protected covered call.The new protected covered call position shown in the table above has a potential return of 3.3% (30% annualized) and a maximum potential loss of 7.5%. The maximum loss for the new protected covered call position has a maximum potential loss of 7.5% (at expiration), even if the price of the stock drops to zero. The specific call option to sell is the 2012 Jun 38 at $2.26 and the put option to purchase is the 2012 Jun34 at $0.56. A profit/loss graph for one contact of the protected covered call is shown below:For a stock price below the $34 strike price of the put option, the value of the protected covered call remains unchanged (at expiration). If the price of the stock increases to around $45, the position can most likely be rolled in order to realize additional potential return.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

However, the bullish position was in the form of a married put, so the position was protected from a large drop in stock price. Following the article, SanDisk reported poor results and a poor outlook and as a result SanDisk's stock price took a hit as shown below:Click to enlargeSanDisk's stock price is currently down about 24% following the previous article, but the married put position is down a much less 8.7%. In the article, the maximum downside was noted as 7.2%, which should have been explained as a maximum loss at expiration, so if we continued to hold the married put position to October expiration, the maximum loss would be 7.2%. However, exiting the position today would result in a loss of 8.7%.In SanDisk's Q1 2012 earnings call held on April, 20, 2012, Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO of SanDisk, indicated the company's poor results were a result of an imbalance between supply and demand, which is expected to continue into the next quarter and then alleviate in the second half of the year with the ramp-up of new smartphones, tablets, ultrabooks and enterprise solid state drives. Additionally, the second half of the year should improve due to seasonality. SanDisk also noted that due to the supply/demand imbalance, the company is pushing the start of Fab 5 out into 2013.SanDisk's problems appear to be temporary and the company appears to have a roadmap for recovering from the supply/demand imbalance hiccup. So a bullish outlook for the company is still warranted.The nice thing about the married put strategy, as illustrated by SanDisk, is an 8.7% loss is much easier to recover than a 24% loss. At this point, a number of options are available with respect to the married put position, including holding the married put position, using income generating methods as described by RadioActiveTrading.com or closing the position and substituting it with a different position.In general, it's not a good idea to take capital from one losing stock and put it into an entirely different stock, as often the investor gets ""bit twice by two different dogs"". However, if the stock is in falling knife mode, then getting back into the same stock is not wise. But, SanDisk is a good company that has run into some choppy water, so consideration will be given for replacing the current SanDisk position with a significantly more risky SanDisk bull-put credit, yet with SanDisk's stock price in the cellar, a position with a good chance for success.A bull-put credit spread may be entered by selling one put option and purchasing a second put option further out-of-the-money. The goal is to have both options expire worthless and keep the initial credit as profit. An attempt to recover from the 8.7% loss will be executed with multiple trades instead of trying to recover the full 8.7% loss all at once.Looking at SanDisk's stock chart above, the company's stock price has found support in the $32 to $34 range three times in the last two years, so a short put option strike price for the bull-put credit spread in the $32 to $34 range should be sufficient.Using PowerOptions Mid-Point Spread Chain tool, some available bull-put credit spreads for SanDisk are shown below:The 2012 May 31/34 bull-put credit spread has a potential return of 4.2% (69.7% annualized) and the strike price of the short put option is 9.7% out-of-the-money. The specific put option to sell is the 2012 May 34 at $0.17 and the put option to purchase is the 2012 May 31 at $0.05. The net credit received for this position is $0.12 ($0.17-$0.05). A profit/loss graph for one contract of the bull-put credit spread is shown below:A management point of $35.5 is set for the bull-put credit spread. For a stock price below the $35.5 management point, the position should be managed for a roll or exit.With this initial bull-put credit spread, about half of the previously sustained loss can potentially be recovered, with the remaining loss to potentially be recovered by other positions which will be entered at a later date.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The stock started the year trading around $31 per share and then rose to about $44, but it has since slipped back to a more attractive level. This company makes disk drives and storage products which are widely used in desktops, laptops and other technology products. This sector has typically appeared undervalued relative to other stocks in the tech sector, but recently it seems that more investors are starting to appreciate the investment potential of companies like Western Digital and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX). Here are a few reasons why, after a recent pullback, investors should consider buying Western Digital shares for the 60% upside potential:Western Digital shares appear to be offer real value to investors and the downside risk looks limited at current levels. Buying into the stock now could reward investors who are willing to buy and hold for a rebound.Key data points for Western Digital from Yahoo Finance:Seagate Technology (STX) makes storage devices, and the shares also appear undervalued. The company recently beat earnings estimates when it reported profits of $2.64 per share (excluding some charges) versus analyst estimates of about $2.10 per share. However, Western Digital shares have seen a sharper drop recently, so it might make sense to focus on that stock for rebound potential.Key data points for Seagate from Yahoo Finance:Data is sourced from Yahoo Finance.

The consensus estimate is $1.55 for EPS and $2.41B for revenue, according to First Call. Analysts expect Western Digital will post earnings growth of 135%, its best performance in a year. Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX), Western Digital's main rival, was hit last summer by the floods in Thailand, though not as badly. Seagate just posted quarterly results that beat earnings and revenue estimates. Wall Street analysts expect Western Digital to follow the same pattern. The company has stunned analyst targets in each of the last three quarters, but these estimates appear to take the new pricing environment into account. Western Digital expects to get back to 60% of its pre-flooding production levels in this quarter and 100% in another two quarters. Investors will be looking for a fresh update on the production and demand situations alongside the raw numbers. Management Q3 guidance calls for adjusted EPS of $1.15-$1.45 on revenue of $2B-$2.15B. Management expects to ship 31M-33M drives in Q3. Analyst Shebley Seyrafi at FBN Securities expects WDC to have shipped 49M units vs.37M in FQ2. WDC expects FY12 capex if forecasts at approximately $750M-$800M. Specific areas of focus on the call will include: 1) the pace of price declines in the coming quarters; 2) target long-term gross margin structure with the inclusion of higher-margin products; 3) potential for opex synergies in light of the China Mofcom restrictions; and 4) a capital allocation strategy with its strong cash position and very strong free cash flow generation in the coming quarters."
527111,22263,2012-04-26T08:14:09-04:00,,"A review of the purchase price WDC paid for Hitachi's Hard Disk Drives (HDD) business is opportune.The deal was agreed 2 years ago, prior to the Thai floods and the consequent change in the supply of Hard Disk Drives. It was prior to the consolidation of the HDD suppliers. The reason for the delay was regulatory questions from China's anti-trust authority, which had recently approved Seagate's acquisition of Samsung's HDD business.The consolidation has resulted in a secular change in the demand/supply dynamics of the HDD industry. For a more detailed description of the consolidation and its impact on the two listed suppliers remaining in the industry, Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) see here.WDC paid $4.8Bn for Hitachi's HDD supply base, which produces 30m HDD's per quarter.The current financial position of the two listed players, specifically the enterprise value, stands as follows:The table below shows the current Enterprise Value the market is imputing for the HDD quarterly capacity. (call this ENT/QTR CAP). The ratio is not meaningful on its own, but highly relevant as a comparative tool for the new listed entities. The underlying capacity is still in flux, given the Thai floods, but depicted below are the capacities of the new business combinations in their stable states, post the Thai flood repair and the Hitachi acquisition.The final line (WDC-Hitachi) in the table imputes the price WDC paid for Hitachi. $5.3bn or $3.9bn cash and 35m WDC shares (The price announced was $4.9bn, but I am using the current market value of WDC shares). As mentioned above, this will be integrated into their financials for the first time on their forthcoming April 26th Conference Call that reviews their 3Q F12 results.The result is remarkable. Look at the final column, ENT/QTR CAP, which depicts the current enterprise value, as adjudged by the market, for the underlying quarterly capacity:As can be seen, the purchase price of Hitachi was fair, just 7% below the current ENT/QTR CAP of Seagate.The final line, WDC-Hitachi shows the new combination, post the acquisition and its purchase price.It shows the significant discount of WDC-Hitachi, a 32% discount at current prices to Seagate. There is absolutely no reason for this; in fact WDC has a superior historic record of earnings stability.The market is currently digesting the secular shift in the industry; the consolidation from 5 to 3 players in the last 12 months; the realization that Solid State Drives (SSD's) are not a realistic substitute, given their much higher cost, when one factors in their cost per gigabyte of storage.Both WDC and STX have had a good run in the last three months, but the out performance of STX has led to this glaring discrepancy in valuation. I believe this is because both players are now incredible cash generators in the new HDD paradigm, and Seagate has disclosed its buyback plans post Samsung, whereas WDC has yet to do so, post Hitachi.The market has not acknowledged is the glaring discount of WDC to STX, an anomaly which will promptly be rectified after WDC's earnings and conference call scheduled for after the market close on the 26th AprilDisclosure:  I am long WDC, and await their imminent announcement of their cash flow  intentions. This will rapidly lead to a closing of the above valuation  disparity."

A protected covered call may be entered by selling a call option and using some of the proceeds to purchase a protective put option. The protected covered call was not hit as bad as the stock, since the protected covered call position was protected by a put option.In a follow-on article posted on April 28, 2012, a strategy was outlined for recovering the loss using a bull-put credit spread. A bull-put credit spread may be entered for a net credit by selling one put option and purchasing a second put option further out-of-the-money with the goal of the options expiring worthless and the initial net credit retained as profit.In the second article, a management point of $35.50 was selected for the bull-put credit spread, which has been breached with the current price of SanDisk's stock around $35.30 as shown below:Based on breaching the $35.50 management point, the position should either be closed or rolled.Since there hasn't been any negative news related to SanDisk recently, and the dip in the company's stock price appears to be more in sympathy to the recent market dip, consideration for rolling the bull-put credit spread to a new bull-put credit spread will be given.Using PowerOptions tools, the current 2012 May 31/34 bull-put spread may be exited for a net debit of $0.31 as shown below: When rolling it is best to roll for a net credit, so a position with a net credit of greater then $0.31 is needed in order to increase the potential return of the position. Looking out further in time, a 2012 Jun 30/33 bull-put credit spread is going for a net credit of $0.51 as shown below: Based on this, the 2012 May 31/34 bull-put spread can be rolled to a 2012 Jun 30/33 bull-put credit spread for a net credit of $0.20 ($0.51-$0.31) which represents an increase in potential return of 6.7%. The additional potential return of 6.7% for rolling to the new position plus the 4.2% for the initial position puts the total potential return at 10.9% which is greater than the 8.7% loss sustained for the protective covered call position considered in the first article.So, if the options for the new position expire worthless in June, this recovers the loss for the protective covered call, plus allows for a profit of about 2.1% (10.9%-8.7%). A profit/loss graph for the new bull-put credit spread, including the previous bull-put credit spread, is shown below:  A new management point for the new bull-put credit spread is set for $34.30, so if the price of the stock drops below $34.30, the position should be managed for an exit or roll.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
512851,25120,2012-04-20T01:43:26-04:00,,"Shares of SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) were hammered in after hours trading after the company reported disappointing first quarter results on already lowered expectations. On top of that comes the disastrous outlook for the second quarter which sent shares 14% lower in after hours trading.First Quarter ResultsSanDisk, the flash memory storage provider reported a weak set of first quarter results. On a GAAP-adjusted basis the company reported net income of $114 million, or $0.46 per share, which is down 50% on the year. Sales fell 7% on the year to $1.21 billion, down 24% compared to the final quarter of 2011.""Our first quarter results were adversely impacted by lower-than-expected pricing and demand weakness in certain segments and we expect similar trends in the second quarter as well,"" according to CEO Mehrotra.OutlookFor the current second quarter the company expects revenues to come in between $950 million and $1.05 billion, far below consensus estimate of $1.29 billion. The revenue guidance compares to revenues of $1.37 billion which the company reported for the second quarter of 2011, indicating a year-on-year decline in revenues of 23-30%. CEO Mehrotra expects that stronger seasonal demand should lead to sequential revenue growth in the third and fourth quarter of the year.ValuationSanDisk ended its first quarter with roughly $5.4 billion in cash and equivalents as well as short and long term marketable securities. The company has some $2.1 billion in long term (convertible) debt outstanding, for a net cash position of some $3.3 billion. Factoring in Thursday's 14% decline in after hours trading, the company is valued at roughly $8.5 billion, or $5.2 billion for the operating assets. This values the company at 0.9 times annual revenues and roughly 5 times 2011's earnings.The decline in first quarter profitability and the grim outlook for the second quarter indicates that the company will report a decline in annual revenues and profitability for 2012 which will drive valuation multiples upwards.Investment ThesisShares have already fallen some 30% in the month of April as the company already warned for disappointing results. Thursday's miss on already lowered expectations and the bad second quarter outlook do not spell much good.The warnings of SanDisk a couple of weeks ago came as a surprise to many amidst a booming global smartphone and tablet market which should drive up demand for SanDisk's products. Recently I already discussed the fact whether SanDisk was the victim of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) trying to squeeze its suppliers or whether SanDisk is missing out on the business.Thursday's announcements make it very clear that SanDisk has problems to compete in the highly competitive global market which still sees strong growth. However SanDisk is financially very strong as the company holds large cash balances and is still profitable. Long term investors or speculators waiting for a rebound after this month's 30% sell off could pick up some shares tomorrow.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

We seriously entertained the possibility that they were high jacked by Somali pirates off a container ship near the coast of Africa - but since we couldn't find any evidence to support what we felt was an otherwise sound theory of inventory shrinkage, and since Samsung is now owned by STX, and HGST is a separate entity from WDC only in name, we decided to go instead with the more radical hypothesis that WDC accounted for the additional units shipped (although we're still looking into the Somali pirate thing).We realize we are going out on a limb here again, because STX with a P/B ratio of 3.89 is clearly the more popular company - but we've learned that stocks are like people, the most popular ones are not necessarily the most virtuous.As far as virtue goes, STX's balance sheet can't be compared to WDC's as pointed out in the article last December ""Hard Drives, Floods, Monasteries and Investment Returns"". That's why when WDC went elephant hunting they brought home a 4.9 bln. dollar deal that put their market share and technology in an entirely different category, and that their competitors couldn't do if they wanted to - and yet they trade (even after a steep run-up) at a mere 1.65 x book. After long and hard reflection we still can find no explanation more sophisticated than the proposed ""popularity"" theory propounded above to account for this disparity in reason, but we do believe that in time, the position will be reversed.Of course the numbers above get more interesting when the June and Dec. QTR estimated TAM is considered. The company commented in their CC:The company then went on to say:The last line appears to confirm another prediction made in the article ""Wait! That was our price target and other musings on Memory and storage"" published last month namely:For nearly two years there has been a persistent notion floating around that SSD or flash memory drives would swiftly replace conventional HDD's to the detriment of companies like WDC and STX, but this, as we have written in the past, has hardly been the case. A review of the Petabytes shipped per category indicates that HDD's have increased at a calculus far in excess of SSD's since 2009 with about 18x the volume expected into 2014 (see IDEMA data).In September 2010 in the article ""640K ought to be enough for anybody…"" WDC vs. STX the following reasoning was provided:Only 34 days ago in the article ""Wait!

525511,20568,2012-04-25T06:52:16-04:00,,"Western Digital Corp. (NASDAQ:WDC) is scheduled to announce its second quarter 2012 results on April 26, 2012 after market close, and we witness modest variation in analysts' estimates at this point.Second Quarter OverviewRevenues in the second quarter of 2012 moved down 19.4% year over year to $1.99 billion. Western Digital Western Digital shipped a total of 28.5 million hard drives as compared with 52.2 million in the year-ago quarter. Revenue from sales of the branded products was $328.0 million, down 40.0% from the year-ago quarter and 33.0% from the September quarter.Considering different sales channels, OEM sales represented 59.0% of revenues, up from 45.0% in the prior year. Distribution channel sales represented 25.0% of revenues, down from 33.0% in the prior year. Retail sales as a percent of revenues were 16.0%, down from prior year's 22.0%. The average selling price was approximately $69.0 per unit, up $22.0 from the year-ago quarter and up $23.0 sequentially.Gross margin in the reported quarter was 32.5% versus 19.2% in the year-ago quarter. Higher ASPs, partially offset by higher cost per unit, contributed to the increased gross margin.On average, per unit costs were approximately $10.0 higher than in the previous quarter due to low production volume, increased use of airfreight, a higher mix of externally procured heads and a higher cost for other components that was impacted by the flood and subsequently affected the company's supply-chain partners.The company expects third quarter revenue to be in the range of $2.0 billion to $2.15 billion; and R&D and SG&A spending excluding acquisition and flood-related expenses of approximately $275.0 million. The company also expects the tax rate to be between 6.0% to 9.0%, with the share count at approximately 239 million. The non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be between $1.15 and $1.45 for the March quarter, which excludes acquisition and flood-related expenses.Agreement of AnalystsOut of the 14 analysts providing estimates for the third quarter, three analysts raised estimates upward over the last thirty days. Two analysts raised estimates for fiscal 2012, while there was just one upward revision for 2013, in the last 30 days.Analysts remain positive about Western Digital's HDD pricing. Drive prices have declined slightly since the channel issues have alleviated somewhat, but they are still significantly higher than what they were before the flood.Moreover, the analysts also expect the total shipments of WDC to grow substantially on a sequential basis in the March quarter. Whereas shipments to distributors are expected to come down during the same period.Other analysts are of the opinion that the acquisition of HGST by WDC is an important event in the HDD history, in spite of the regulatory issues faced by the company, and should drive record profitability for both the companies. Moreover, the analysts also expect the combined entity to operate rationally and within profitability metrics consistent with the history of Western Digital.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsOver the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter moved up by a penny to 7 cents per share. For fiscal year 2012 and 2013, the analysts' estimates have moved up by 14 cents and 20 cents, respectively, to $6.62 and $8.98, respectively.Our RecommendationWestern Digital rolled out decent second quarter 2012 results, exceeding our expectations with a substantial improvement in sales from the year-ago period. The company is trying to lower its interest expense by reducing the debt burden and is also trying to improve its shipment, whereas the improvement in pricing environment is also good compared to the pre-flood period. On the other hand, the difficult business environment in Europe may hamper the growth prospects of the company.Moreover, the Hitachi deal is expected to strengthen its foothold in the data storage business in spite of some regulatory issues. Although the company has been able to handle competition efficiently, bigger players like Fujitsu Ltd (OTCPK:FJTSY), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) pose a considerable challenge.Currently, Western Digital has a Zacks #1 Rank, implying a short-term Strong Buy rating."

The consensus estimate is 70c for EPS and $1.23B for revenue, according to First Call. After reporting mixed Q4 results back in January, SanDisk primed investors for bad news by lowering its outlook for Q1 -- owing to demand uncertainty from the smartphone makers and the somewhat higher rate of market price declines seen in late Q4 and early Q1. On April 3, SanDisk lowered its Q1 revenue guidance to approximately $1.2B, down from prior $1.3B-$1.35B view. Total gross margin is also expected to be below the previously guided range of 39%-42%. SanDisk also announced at its analyst day that it expects contribution from the SSD business to grow roughly 14.0% in 2014. The acquisition of FlashSoft and the licensing agreement with Diskeeper highlights SanDisk's commitment to further expand in the SSD segment. Management did say on its last earnings call that 2012 will be the ""inflection point"" of SSD growth. That enterprise and client markets will become strong contributors to revenue growth in 2012 and beyond. The company said enterprise and client markets will become strong contributors to revenue growth in 2012 and beyond. SanDisk forecasted FY12 revenue of $6.2B-$6.6B -- seeing most of the FY12 revenue growth in the 2H. FY12 capex was pegged at $1.1B-$1.6B. Although SanDisk negatively pre-announced, Wedbush thinks Street estimates for Q1 earnings and Q2 outlook remain too high. SanDisk strength of late has been attributed to renewed takeover speculation. RBC Capital has break-up value of $68-$83 on the company."

Its products are used in consumer devices such as digital cameras, mobile phones and flash drives. After cutting its Q1 outlook SanDisk stock fell by 10%, and this may offer an opportunity to buy the stock at a discount.(Click to enlarge)Let's take a look at the financials:Revenue has grown by over $2 billion over the last two years, and free cash flow as been positive with the exception of 2008.Owner EarningsOwner earnings is a better measure for valuation purposes than free cash flow. Warren Buffett defines owner earnings as follows:I'll calculate owner earnings by taking the five-year average capital expenditure and subtracting that from the operating cash flow. I'll also subtract stock-based compensation from the operating cash flow since it has a dilutive effect on the company but is routinely included in the cash flow figure. I'll also add interest payments adjusted for taxes since interest is tax deductible.Owner earnings smooth out capital expenditures and provide a clearer picture of the profitability of the company. Let's use the owner earnings figures to determine SanDisk's Cash Return on Invested Capital, or CROIC. This is the cash return generated by the company on invested capital, and is simply the owner earnings divided by the total invested capital. This is a better measure than ROIC because ROIC relies on earnings, which is a poor measure of profitability.2008 and 2009 were weak years for SanDisk, but CROIC for 2011 was 9%, which means that given, say, $1 million in invested capital (retained earnings for example) the company will generate $90,000 in cash on that investment. Here's what the balance sheet looks like:SanDisk has $16.47 in net cash and investments on its balance sheet, which represents more than a third of the company's market capitalization. This large cash position offers protection against weak demand.ValuationI use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of a company. I will use a discount rate of 15%, and you can read about my view on discount rates here. The average analyst estimate for five-year earnings growth is 15.78%, while the CROIC is 9%. I'll be conservative and set the initial owner earnings growth rate to 6% and allow that growth rate to decay to a perpetual rate of 3% over the next 20 years according to the growth table below.Using these parameters I arrive at a fair value of $54.86, which is about $10 higher than the most recent share price. A table with buy targets for various margins of safety is listed below.ConclusionSanDisk currently trades at about a 20% discount to my fair value estimate and offers a compelling value. The recent drop in market price has opened up an opportunity, and SanDisk's ample cash cushion should protect the company against short-term demand weakness.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in SNDK over the next 72 hours."
546211,24178,2012-05-01T10:54:24-04:00,,"According to a research report published last Friday, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has downgraded Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) from Buy to Neutral, and lowered their target from $54 to $46. In the report, Bank of America said:Since many retail investors may have missed the conference call, this seems like a good opportunity to provide a breakdown of the Bank of America analysts' comments, which appear to have precipitated the sell-off in the shares on April 27, 2012.To begin with:This means Bank of America was off on their Q3 EPS estimates by approximately 38%. That's not a small number. However, to their credit, at least they are open to ""true confession.""Next up:In the last 15 quarters, WD has beaten estimates and their own guidance 12 times, or 80% of the time. On average those 12 QTR's beat analysts' estimates by about 32% (or roughly the same figure as the BofA original estimate missed actual in FQ3). Also, if the analysts' comments are read carefully, they guided lower than BofA's estimates, which they have established in their own release as at least 38% inaccurate, yet they fail to point out that WDC's guidance still beats the second figure (the Street's) of $2.30, by as much as 25 cents (or greater than 10%).In this instance a beat of 32% (the historical average, based on 12 quarters) would mean Q4 earnings of $3.10 to $3.36 per share. This seems likely to happen next quarter (barring insurance payments being received).For the sake of argument, let's go with the company's guidance so as to share in BofA's ""disappointment."" At $2.45 per share (the median), the company would be earning $9.80 a share on an annualized basis. Given Friday's closing price, which was nicely discounted, evidently because of the above remarks, the company would be earning 26% of the share price in only one year - that means at the closing price on Friday April 27th, the company would earns its entire market cap in less than 4 years.If the higher EPS figure turns out to be right, then sometime in July of this year when the company next reports, the P/ (annualized) E will be a mere 2.9 (not including any insurance payments).It's amazing what you can do with first grade mathThe current market cap is based on the shares outstanding in the most recent financials. However, those are reported (as must be the case when companies issue or take back shares during a quarter) as an ""average"" outstanding during the quarter. In this case the average figure is 241M.At that share count, earnings of $2.45 per share in FQ4 would equate to ~$590M.However, the actual shares outstanding at quarter's end were not 241M, but rather 269M., meaning earnings would then be $659M for the 4th fiscal quarter.If the higher estimate (of an earnings beat) above is correct, than the number would be $877M.The potential range of results in investors' calculus then for FQ4 is 286M or ~49% of the low estimate.Details, DetailsIn the article Hard Drives, Floods, Monasteries and Investment Returns published last November the focus at least in part was Insurance proceeds. However, investors may have forgotten about this, when considering what the company's future earnings will look like. As written in the article:Wolfgang U. Nickl, the company's CFO had the following to say in the Q3 CC about Insurance:What could these figures possibly be?First, in the nine months ending March 30th, the company spent about 214M on ""charges related to flooding"".Any claim for ""business interruption"" would have to take into account the lost unit sales at the (possibly at elevated ASPs) for at least 2 quarters. Finding out what exactly this figure is, would be as simple as looking at the annualized run rate of unit sales for WDC prior to the flood, then adding up the lost unit sales in the last few quarters, based on the former trend. The insurance adjusters will likely do something basically like this in order to ascertain the value of a ""business interruption"" claim.For our purposes, we'll use a conservative figure of 25M units of lost sales at an ASP of $68 (the most recent figure) or 1.7 B in lost revenue. At 16 points net margin (most recent MRQ), the company would receive an insurance payment of $270M for this aspect of the claim.Therefore, a very rough estimate of the total claim might be 484M or $1.79 per share (at the higher quarter-end share count).Note: There are other aspects that would exist in the claim (personnel costs, etc.), which are not included in this calculation - they are left out in the interest of being conservative, and in the event the unit x ASP figures above are too aggressive.There is no way to know when these payments might be received, but whatever quarter they are received in, this number would have to be added to the company's already very high earnings of at least $2.45 per share.Are you sure that's what they said?Bank of America went on to say:Does this reference the TAM? Because the TAM is up as expected and very nearly at the same level as a year ago and growing as Coyne's comments indicate:Also, Coyne spoke of demand at retail that couldn't get met, and later in the call had this to say:Where was it said on the Conference call that HGST's LTA's were in anyway a problem? As for ""pricing concessions"" the analyst appears to be slightly confused by a comment made by Richard Kugele of Needham & Company, namely:To which Mr. Coyne responded:That clarification seems clear, particularly as it relate to language such as ""highly desirable"", ""significantly accretive"" and finally ""…not indicating any kind of problem"".And finally arriving at the following:There is one small detail the analyst seems to be overlooking in his prediction about what the HDD industry can and cannot have, namely the consolidation form 8 to 2 concerns in recent years, or the creation of a veritable duopoly, with WDC by far the larger and more effective company.Mobile content is proliferating in interesting and unexpected ways, and the cloud, which increasingly stores that content, wouldn't exist without HDDs. This fact alone makes Mr. Craig's comments unseemly. Western Digital, with its extraordinary innovation, operational excellence, and superior leadership appears well position to have precisely their ""way"".""Excessively cautious""The fear that HDD prices will fall appears to be derived solely from Western Digital comments that capacity recovered faster than expected.Citigroup analyst Joe Yoo for instance commented ""These fears were further fueled by excessively cautious second calendar quarter gross margin guide"".It is not clear where the ""excessively cautious"" part of the call took place, especially given the management quotes above. Nonetheless, investors and speculators apparently have become ""fearful"", but it may not be because of the conference call so much as it is because of the Analysts' ""calls"".The Right QuestionsThe question for investors ought not to be ""can the analyst see the future"" (an impossibility), but rather, what is their investment philosophy (if they have one). This is extremely important, because it will determine how they see value. Needless to say, there are many different investment philosophies, and varying degrees of ability - and philosophies, like abilities, are not all equal.On Value and ValuationThe last comments of the report, specifically ""…despite attractive valuation"", appears to show, that this analyst is at least not in the ""value-investor"" camp. How is this known? Because the stock is not an ""attractive valuation"" at all; it's an insane valuation - but only a true value investor would notice the distinction, or care. Speculation invariably has a myopic preoccupation with one coefficient - namely that of the earnings, which makes the sales ""trend"" the only data which matters in determinations of attractiveness. However, the sales trend (the least knowable), is most subject to the upheavals of a volatile world. Therefore, projecting trends into the future is really nothing more than making a guess. To talk about value but not actually care whatsoever about it just doesn't seem right.Are you sure about what you're doing?Can Annie Oakley shoot?The mind has many ways of playing tricks on itself, such as the false reasoning that goes something like this ""we shouldn't buy any more shares, because the price, even after Friday's sell-off, has already gone up so much"".It seems probable that many investors in WDC shares in the last six month may have been feeling precisely this way within the context of analysts' comments. If that is the case, the reasoning is a logical fallacy, that appeals more to the minds proclivity to try to discern trends, than to a rational assessment of verifiable information and data.The central problem outlined above, however, does not deal with information but, significantly, what appears to be misinformation. When reading the subject reports, it was hard to avoid feeling a mix of excitement, disbelief, and recognition of superior clarity around the numbers, as well as absolute confidence in what we were about to do. ""Stepping to the side lines"" really means selling, and when you're in the position of an analyst, encouraging others to do the same.Despite the 50% (post sell-off) earned for investors since last November, we were plowing unprecedented amounts of investor capital into the shares late in the day April 27th and early Monday morning (starting in the mid $37's). Why? Because it's hard to succeed from the sidelines.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

473651,25036,2012-04-02T16:55:46-04:00,,"Imagine 128 gigabits inhabiting something smaller than a U.S. penny. That's 128 billion bits of information stored on the tiniest silicon die, and SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) has just made it a reality, in its pursuit of better, smaller, faster flash memory storage solutions, without which today's data mobility would not exist. (Press release)Consumers may only be familiar with the company's removable memory cards, flash cards, memory sticks and USB flash drives, for use in their camera, smart phone, notebook, tablet, TV, gaming system or car audio. Yet embedded memory devices used by leading electronics manufacturers (OEMs) are an even more significant revenue source for SanDisk.SanDisk also makes Sansa brand MP3 players, solid state drives to enhance laptop and gaming performance, data transfer devices, and, through recent acquisitions, a suite of software products to enable data capture, sharing, management, security and recovery.Following the May 2011 acquisition of Pliant Technology, the company is also involved in enterprise storage solutions, producing high performance solid state drives (SSDs) to transform cloud and data center applications by reducing space requirements, purchase cost and power usage. SanDisk's corporate headquarters are in California, but its 4,000 employees are distributed across the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe and Israel. High volume manufacturing facilities, three of them in partnership with Toshiba, allow the company to ship more than two million flash products every day, and have contributed to a 50,000-fold reduction in the cost of flash memory over the last 20 years. (Corporate profile)R&D expenditures totaled $513 million in 2011, with a focus on constant innovations, new devices for consumers and enterprise solutions ahead of the market. SanDisk maintains relationships with OEMs, operating system vendors, mobile network operators, universities, system integrators, application developers, standards bodies and even Hollywood studios. A recent press release announced a joint venture with Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment (NWS), Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group (TWX) and Western Digital (WDC), to create easier and faster ways of organizing, storing and accessing digital movies and TV shows. At the February 2012 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, SanDisk highlighted its close collaboration with companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC), Texas Instruments (TXN) and Freescale (FSL).SanDisk and its competitors operate in a market subject to major fluctuations in supply and demand for products, and downward price pressures coupled with increasing memory capacity and performance expectations. The company's fortunes also depend largely on the success of its OEM customers. In 2011 SanDisk's 10 largest customers accounted for 48% of revenue, led by Samsung with 10%. Competing with SanDisk in this challenging market are U.S. companies like Intel, Micron Technology (MU) and Fusion-io (FIO), as well as foreign-owned Samsung, Toshiba, Sony (SNE), Verbatim and Hynix.SanDisk's FY 2011 ended on January 1 2012. Total revenue for the year was $5.7 billion, up 17% on 2011. Direct product sales accounted for 92% of revenue. More than half the company's sales are generated outside the U.S. Both gross margin and operating margin declined significantly when compared with 2011, contributing to the fact that pre-tax income of $1.48 billion was only 1.3% higher than 2011. Earnings per diluted share fell from $5.44 in 2011 to $4.04 in 2012. However, the company's GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation interprets net income as slightly improved. Senior notes to the value of $0.98 billion were issued in 2011, and the company's cash flow also reveals heavy investment activity, probably linked to its targeted acquisition strategies. (Q4 2011 Financial statements (pdf))During the Q4 2011 earnings call, SanDisk president and CEO Sanjay Mehrotra observed that the $1.5 billion revenue from mobile embedded business was almost double the 2010 figure, and that SanDisk iNAND technology was a key element in the mobile device designs of eight out of the top 10 chipset vendors for both the Android and Windows platforms. CFO Judy Brunner pointed to yen exchange rate fluctuations and necessary increases in R&D expenditure as two of the reasons for the fall in gross and operating margins.In a presentation to analysts (pdf) on February 16 2012, SanDisk emphasized its worldwide No.1 market share in memory cards and USB flash drives, the more than 250,000 retail stores now selling its products and its $2 billion in revenue growth in the last two years. A breakdown of FY 2011 revenue showed that $3.5 billion was generated by sales to OEMs (25% growth year-on-year) and $1.8 billion (8% growth) by retail sales, with royalties and licensing fees providing the remaining $0.4 billion.Industry-leading technology includes advances in scaling for NAND flash memory and initial production of the industry's smallest chips for 2012. A smart/mobile way of life across all demographics - the very young and the elderly, and non-mainstream lifestyles as well as the expected business and health care users, students and schoolchildren - points to a secure future for the company's products. Its potential market is expected to be over $46 billion by 2015, and SanDisk believes it is in a strong position to win a large share of the total. SSDs in particular are expected to grow from their current 3% of revenue to 25% by 2014. Guidance for 2012 puts revenue in the range $6.2-6.6 billion, with a 23-27% growth in operating income.SanDisk benefits from its diverse offerings and vertical integration, and from current market trends led by cloud computing and virtualization. The forecast explosion in the use of mobile devices, especially in emerging markets, increases the need for fast delivery of cloud data for e-commerce, social media and video content. It may not have the same buzz as 128 gigabits, but $46 billion is still a sizable number, and this future-focused company appears to be positioning itself to reap the rewards.With the recent troubles related to hard drive manufacturing due to flooding in Thailand, SanDisk may have benefited with increased sales and potentially increased pricing. With the company's future prospects, SanDisk looks like a bargain at this point with a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 12 and a Price-to-Sales ratio of 2.2. An investment to consider for SanDisk is a married put. A married put may be entered by purchasing a put option in order to protect an investment in a stock, yet continue to participate in an upward movement in the stock's price.Using PowerOptions, a table of October married put positions for SanDisk was found with respective maximum risks as shown below:Click to enlargeIn order to reduce time value decay per day, it's typically best to select married put options further out in time, at least six months.Since SanDisk's stock price has been in the $54 price range (shown below) in the last six months, it would be best to select a put option with a strike price less than $54, yet select a position with an acceptable maximum percent risk.Based on this, an attractive married put position for SanDisk is the 2012 October 52.5 at $7.00 with a maximum potential risk of 7.2%. A profit/loss graph for one contract of the married put position is shown below:For a stock price below the $52.5 strike price of the put option, the price of the married put position remains unchanged (at expiration) and the maximum potential loss that can be experienced is 7.2%.Once the price of the stock increases to the $52.5 strike price of the put option or greater, income methods as outlined by RadioActiveTrading.com can be applied in order to receive income and reduce risk.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
441351,20725,2012-03-19T02:38:14-04:00,,"With SanDisk (SNDK) trading near 52 week highs, I decided to take a closer look at the stock. The valuation metrics come out very mixed but generally lean on the fair value to overvalued side. Below is a closer look at the valuation metrics and the chart.Valuation: SanDisk's trailing 5 year valuation metrics suggest that the stock is overvalued as all of the metrics are above their respective 5 year averages. SanDisk's current P/B ratio is 1.7 and it has averaged 1.5 over the past 5 years with a high of 2.5 and low of 0.6. SanDisk's current P/S ratio is 2.1 and it has averaged 1.8 over the past 5 years with a high of 3.3 and low of 0.6. SanDisk's current P/E ratio is 12.4 and it has averaged 9.5 over the past 5 years with a high of 16.2 and low of 7.5.Price Target: The consensus price target for the analysts who follow SanDisk is $60. That is upside of 18% from today's stock price of $50.25 and suggests that the stock is fairly valued at these levels. This also suggests that the stock has limited upside and should be avoided at its current stock price.Forward Valuation: SanDisk is currently trading at about $50 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $5.47 next year, an earnings increase of 17% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 9.2. Taking a look at other semiconductors will give us a better idea of the stock's relative valuation. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is currently trading at about $28 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $2.61 next year, an earnings increase of 8% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 10.6. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is currently trading at about $33 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $2.39 next year, an earnings increase of 37% y/y, for a forward P/E ratio of 13.8. Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) is currently trading at about $9 a share with analysts expecting EPS of $0.54 next year for a forward P/E ratio of 16.3. The mean forward P/E of SanDisk's competitors is 13.6 which suggests that SanDisk is undervalued relative to its publically traded competitors.Earnings Estimates: SanDisk has beat EPS estimates every time in the past 4 quarters. The company's EPS figures have come in between 3 cents and 14 cents from consensus estimates or about 2.4% to 14% from analyst estimates. The company has reported earnings that have differed from analyst estimates by a wide margin which suggests that the stock may experience upside from earnings surprises.Price Action: SanDisk is up 16.8% over the past year, outperforming the S&P 500, which is up 12.5%. Looking at the technicals, the stock is currently above its 50 day moving average, which sits at $49.02 and above its 200 day moving average, which sits at $45.17.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
454851,24178,2012-03-23T16:49:50-04:00,,"We were waiting for at least a 7% price jump when we published our article Hard Drives, Floods, Monasteries and Investment Returns on Dec. 2nd, 2011 - good thing we weren't holding our breath. We thought the article looked pretty smart, not only because the Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) investment had already returned 30.2% to investors by the time we were able to publish, but also because we had this really crazy $67 dollar price target on the stock (way higher than any other analyst at the time) - we thought people would listen.Nonetheless, we felt bashful about our price target so we prefaced it with a bit of defensive language (from the article):We went on to write:Since we had to postpone our ""ego fest"" then, and the shares have now returned ~67% to investors, we thought this would be a good opportunity to make up for lost time.Getting Back to Holding our BreathPresently we're less interested with the return achieved for investors (which annualizes to 190%), and more interested in the mystery of how analysts determine their upgrades, downgrades and future price targets - which the market then promptly respond to - we want to know how the analysts do it.We considered a bad write-up full of misguided information, that we would then later do an ""about-face"" on, hoping readers would be more responsive to our writing - we entertained the idea for a while, but then had to dismiss the strategy on the grounds that it was unethical and since we are dealing with Wall Street operators, we realize we must be ethical.In addition to overreacting to the potential long-term effects of the flooding in Thailand last year, there was doubt cast on the ability of WDC's management team to execute on its proposed acquisition of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST). We weren't buying it (the story that is). In our rough notes, published at the bottom of our Dec. 2nd, 2011 article we simply commented:Then we had an unmistakable regression and departed from the ""high road"" when we blurted out in the same notes:Even if the comment was a ""hook to the chin"" it seems it may have been entirely deserved:From their November 15th report:Two days after they wrote these words, we were out buying for investors accounts - it's like it was raining gold - hence our decision to add Needham and Co. to our list of Christmas card recipients.The curious thing about point one above is that WDC had always planned to issue stock in order to acquire the assets of Hitachi (and the deal did in fact cost them more, something to the tune of 400 mln., making their March 22nd release - below - all the more curious).Point two was completely unfounded, how was it ever ""increasingly ""likely"" that the deal would not go through? Last time we checked Chinese regulators don't play Mahjong with U.S. based analysts. If they do, surely the SEC would like to know.If the analyst had studied WDC post flood, how is it possible that they arrived at the conclusion that WDC would be forced to ""expend considerable cash to recover it's manufacturing capabilities"" as the amvona article mentions repeatedly, there is this thing called ""insurance"" which they may or may not have heard of, but the existence of which is plastered all over WDC's annual reports.Even though the analysts were wrong, it appears market participants continue to eagerly await their proclamations - though they may constitute a complete reversal in opinion.Consider the case of the Needham and Co. March 22nd upgrade:In this case, some 4-plus months later they have said almost precisely the opposite of what was said back in November of 2011. About-face or not, the shares jumped almost 7% on the news.When investors are lead to think a security is less desirable at the very moment it's pricing is most attractive, and told it's a ""strong buy"" once it has risen some 65%, it's a problem.If Time Arbitrage CountsAssuming the $66 PT is a good number, and in Needham's defense, their followers would still make a very healthy 57% return. However, amvona investors having acquired the shares at ~25.60 would make about 157% at $66 per share.A Further Note to Investors:On February 24th we wrote in a note to investors the following:Time will tell if the remaining five forecasts hold true as well.A Hypothesis for Memory and StorageWe had intended to write a related article last week called ""A hypothesis for Memory and Storage."" We began by scribbling out some notes on March 13th , 2012 - the notes never became an article because of an intervening visit from an old friend - and rather than adding the notes to the growing pile of ""unpublished articles,"" we thought we would add them here since they may be of some small benefit to readers interested in the industry. Along the way, we used these ideas as our basis for getting at least one investor out of a large stake in SanDisk (SNDK) writing in part:Here are the notes for ""A hypothesis for Memory and Storage"":HDD still low cost Connecting to Memory vs. Connecting to DataOn the Nature of DevicesDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
481071,25120,2012-04-05T11:59:20-04:00,,"Shares of SanDisk (SNDK) took a serious beating yesterday after the company warned of disappointing results (link). Shares lost 11% on the close in a generally weak market.First Quarter OutlookSanDisk lowered its first quarter revenue outlook from $1.30-$1.35 billion to around $1.2 billion. This is quite a shock with the investment community anticipating revenues of $1.34 billion. When SanDisk originally issued its first quarter outlook in January 2012, investors were already disappointed as analysts expected the company to generate $1.4 billion in revenue. Gross margins will miss the earlier forecast of 39%-42% as well.With the company reporting a 17% full year revenue growth for 2011 the announcement comes as quite a shock. Last year SanDisk reported $1.29 billion in revenue for the first quarter, which indicates that revenue will be down about 8% on the year.The revisions come as a complete surprise to many observers as SanDisk said it was an ""important"" supplier to Apple (AAPL). Somehow reporting a year-on-year revenue decline while mentioning that you are an important customer of Apple does not make sense. Did SanDisk lose most of its business to competitor Qualcomm (QCOM), which recently did show strong operational performance, or has Apple started a new round of squeezing its suppliers?ValuationSanDisk holds large cash balances, just like any other technology company nowadays. In its latest quarterly filing the company reported $2.9 billion in cash and a debt position of roughly $1.6 billion, leaving a net cash position of around $1.3 billion.Factoring in today's decline values the company at $10.8 billion, or $9.5 billion for the operating assets. This valuation implies a 1.7 times annual revenue multiple and a mere 9.5 times price-earnings ratio.This looks rather cheap. However given the disappointing first quarter outlook it might be that 2012 is not going to be as good as everyone previously thought.It is already questionable at the moment if the company can meet its results of 2011 in terms of revenue and earnings.Is Apple Becoming Too Dominant?It is widely reported that Apple is known for squeezing its suppliers to accepting the lowest possible prices as the company makes full use of its market dominance. This might be one of the reasons that shares of Apple are down a mere 0.8% in today's session.A basket comprised out of known Apple suppliers being: Broadcom (BRCM), Cypress Semiconductor (CY), Fairchild Semiconductor (FCS), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Micron Technology (MU), LSI Corp (LSI-OLD), ON Semiconductor (ONNN), Qualcomm, Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) and TriQuint Semiconductor (TQNT) lost on average 3.1% today on renewed fears that being an Apple supplier does not necessarily mean highly profitable revenue generation.ConclusionSomething bad happened to SanDisk yesterday. Is it merely the fact that they are not such a prominent Apple supplier as they were in the recent past and could they have possibly lost important orders to some other suppliers? Or has Apple been squeezing all its suppliers just a little bit more and can we expect more profit warnings from suppliers in the coming weeks ahead of the earnings season?Let's say the truth is somewhere in the middle, but shareholders in SanDisk have just seen their year-to-date returns gone up in smoke.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
473721,24187,2012-04-02T17:15:06-04:00,,"What do cloud computing, DVRs, emerging markets, medical imagining, video surveillance, and web search engine infrastructure all have in common? If you answered ""expanding data storage requirements,"" you guessed the theme for this week's ideas post.Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) provides two different types of data storage devices. Hard drives, which are their primary data storage media, are used in personal and cloud computing facilities. Office supply stores also sell them as separate devices that can be connected to a PC or server. According to the 2011 Western Digital 10k, the storage industry sold 89% more hard drives than PCs in calendar 2010. They also manufacture solid-state drives, which typically store data in smaller devices such as tablets and smartphones.Storage providers compete based upon a variety of criteria including: price, capacity, data transfer rate, power consumption, quality, reliability, production volume capabilities, and noisiness. Historically, they competed aggressively on price, and both overcapacity and price sensitivity of customers made this industry difficult for investors.While there are high barriers to entry due to strict manufacturing requirements, hard disk drives (HDDs) tend to be standardized and buyers can switch between competing products easily. Western Digital's average sales price (ASP) per unit was $51, $50, and $45 in 2009, 2010, and 2011, respectively. However, they shipped 146, 194, and 207 million units in these same years.In addition to expanding data storage requirements, consolidation represents another attractive feature of the industry today. According to Morningstar and IDC, there are only three participants in the hard disk drive industry: Western Digital (WDC), Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF).Recently Western Digital and Seagate acquired the HDD divisions of Hitachi and Samsung, respectively. If pre-consolidation revenues (4th quarter 2010) are combined, then market shares are Western Digital/Hitachi (49%), Seagate/Samsung (40%), and Toshiba (11%). However, WDC had to divest some assets to Toshiba to complete its acquisition. These companies sell their products globally. Foreign sales accounted for 83%, 81%, and 80% of Western Digital net revenue for 2011, 2010, and 2009.In addition, there tends to be high level of integration between HDD manufactures and PC makers such as Dell. In summary, this industry is becoming increasingly attractive through increased demand and consolidation.Western Digital (WDC): Western Digital had an awful year in 2011. In October, floods inundated all of WDCs Thailand manufacturing facilities and the company charged-off $199 million in damages. The floods resulted in a drop in revenue and units sold. Therefore, WDC's financial statements in 2011 are not representative of normal operations. The damage was sufficiently extensive that management does not expect to reach full production levels until September 2012.Additionally, Seagate claimed WDC misappropriated confidential information and trade secrets and an arbitrator in Minnesota awarded Seagate $630.4 million in November. Subsequently, WDC has filed a petition to have the award vacated. In the short term, Seagate benefitted at WDC expense and currently has both a higher market capitalization and enterprise value.An examination of 15 quarters of Western Digital's income statements indicates that net income of $250 million should be representative of earnings when operations normalize in September and the impact of the acquisition is not included. Annualized earnings would then be $1 billion Assuming the Hitachi acquisition was reasonably priced, then the stock price today should be approximately the same had the acquisition not taken place. There were 237 million shares outstanding as of December 30, 2011. Therefore, market capitalization neglecting the acquisition would be roughly $10 billion. Under these assumptions, forward price to earnings ratio for Calendar 2013 should be around 10.Since 2011 calendar year financials were fairly indicative of performance, Western Digital ranked highly on the Financial Metrics component of the Chaikin Power Gauge (see my rating methodology). Expert Opinions are also favorable with high Analyst Opinions and Short Interest Ranks. On March 22, Richard Kugele from Needham & Co. raised his rating and price target to ""Strong Buy"" and $66 per share. This represents a 56% premium to today's price.Seagate (STX): Since October 3rd 2011, Seagate shares have surged 186%; whereas, WDC is only up 72%. Prior to the Thailand disaster Seagate was having difficulties. In the Supplemental Commentary on October 20th, Management mentions lower unit sales and revenue as a result of share loss in the mission critical and notebook markets.Unlike WDC, which was heavily dependent on Thailand for certain key components, Seagate has geographically diverse operations that mitigated the effect of the floods on operations. Since the supply of drives has been insufficient to meet demand, Seagate also was able to obtain prices in the quarter ending December 30, 2011 that were $13 higher than September. As a result, Seagate captured a short-term profit windfall through its excellent operations risk management strategy.However, there may be some sustained effects as well. Seagate entered into binding long-term agreements with its largest customers to ensure continuity of their hard drive supply. This potentially represents a game changer for the industry. Previously, hard disk suppliers had to keep inventory on hand to meet just-in-time requirements for the computer original equipment manufacturers. Long-term agreements should enable HDD suppliers to lower working capital, and inventory, and more accurately forecast future sales. Some of these agreements last for multiple years.Given the recent stock performance, it is perhaps not surprising that STX exhibits high Price Strength, Chaikin Price Trend, and Price Strength vs. Industry ranks. Since the Thai floods resulted in a short-term windfall, Earnings Estimate Revisions are extremely high. Lofty Analyst Opinions indicate that they believe recent events have changed the dynamic in this once unprofitable industry.Strategy: While the industry as a whole has become significantly more attractive, we believe WDC represents more compelling value than Seagate. While Western Digital has had its problems, it is likely to regain its status as the storage industry leader. When combined with the increasing demand for data storage products, we think the financials make WDC compelling.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

A search parameter for Price-to-Sales (P/S) of less than one was used to include value companies in the search. Profitable companies were included in the search by selecting the Price-to-Earnings parameter greater than zero. Companies with stock in an up trend were found by including stocks having a 100 day moving average greater than the 200 day moving average.When Western Digital Corporation was founded in 1970, a typical hard disk drive was the size of a large closet, could store about 100 MB of data and cost tens of thousands of dollars. In 2012, Western Digital's website offers a 'My Passport' 2TB sleek portable drive, measuring slightly more than 4 inches by 3 inches and less than an inch thick, for $249.99. Digital storage now extends into every corner of daily life, including fixed and mobile telecommunications and computing, entertainment and social media. Western Digital has been producing hard drives since 1988, and is now a global leader in hard drives and solid state drives for use in desktop computers, notebooks, smartphones, tablets, entertainment devices and computer networks for enterprise, telecommunications, medical, aerospace and military applications.The hard drive market is set to explode with the growing demand for data mobility, cloud infrastructure and the increasing uptake of social media, together with consumers' expectations of ever higher capacity, speed and simplicity in a device constantly diminishing in size. Western Digital's strong focus on high performance, reliability and low power consumption combine to deliver its leadership position. The company employs around 62,000 people at its worldwide design, manufacturing and sales facilities, with headquarters in Irvine, California.International Data Corporation (IDC), the leading intelligence provider for the IT industry, published global hard disk drive market share statistics (pdf) at the end of 2010. Western Digital led with 31% of the market, followed by Seagate (STX) with 29%, Hitachi Global Storage with 18%, and Samsung and Toshiba with 11% each. IDC has recently updated its industry forecast, predicting global revenue growth at an 8.6% compound annual rate from 2011 to 2016.One way to eliminate competition is to buy it out. On March 8 2012 Western Digital completed its acquisition of Viviti Technologies (formerly Hitachi Global Storage Services) for $3.9 billion cash plus 25 million Western Digital shares (which will give Hitachi 10% ownership and the right to nominate two board members). The acquisition was financed by a five-year term loan of $2.3 billion, plus short-term revolving credit and existing company cash balances. Combined revenue for the two companies was $15 billion in 2011. Meanwhile, Western Digital is fighting against an order to pay Seagate $525 million in a damages claim involving a former Seagate employee and the disclosure of confidential information and trade secrets.Western Digital's financial information for investors (pdf), published at the end of FY 2011 (year ended July 1 2011), shows steadily-rising volume sales from 2007 onwards, except for the global financial crisis provoked dip in 2009. Market share also climbed throughout this period, but revenue declined from a 2010 peak of $9.85 billion to $9.53 billion in 2011. Net income was $726 million ($3.09 per share), a sharp decline from 2010's $1.4 billion. Asia generated 55% of revenue in 2011, with the Americas and Europe dividing the balance equally. Approximately 50% of revenue comes from the company's top ten customers, and channel revenue figures attribute the same proportion of revenue to embedded drives for original equipment manufacturers. Sales through distributors account for about 30% of revenue, and retail sales for the remaining 20%.The devastating floods in the second half of calendar 2011 in Thailand, where many global disk drive producers have major manufacturing facilities, caused dramatic disruption to the worldwide supply of drives. This had a consequent effect on Western Digital's volume sales as well as adding millions to its expenses. The company's Thailand factories were out of action for many weeks, and global industry shipments were expected to fall short of demand by 50 million units in the December 2011 quarter alone. (News article)Western Digital completed its second quarter of FY 2012 on December 30 2011, with half-year revenue of $4.7 billion significantly impacted by low shipment volumes following the disruption to manufacturing. Net income fell to $384 million as a result of the lower revenue and flood-related increased costs, and the company's market share fell to 24% in the second quarter. President and CEO John Coyne commented in the Q2 2012 earnings press release that substantial progress had been made in restoring manufacturing capabilities, which should be back to pre-flood levels by the end of September 2012. Meanwhile the company is expanding its manufacturing plant in Malaysia.During the Q2 2012 earnings conference call, Mr Coyne remarked that he expected supply constraints to continue through calendar 2012, and that the pipeline would not be refilled to normal inventory levels until the first half of calendar 2013. Investment in product development had been maintained through the flood period, so that Western Digital would be in a position to offer new products and advanced technology to regain its leadership position in spite of recent challenges. COO Timothy Laden spoke about the lessons learned, with the result that the company will seek a greater geographic dispersal of its own and its component suppliers' manufacturing operations to avoid the risks presented by concentration in a single area, even though this may result in some logistical cost increases. CFO Wolfgang Nickl noted that the average drive selling price had risen around 50% in the latest quarter (possibly as a result of supply shortage, although he did not say so) and that two customers, Dell (DELL-OLD) and Taiwan's Acer, each represented more than 10% of revenue.Even with the bad news surrounding Western Digital with respect to the flooding in Thailand and the damage claim with Seagate, Western Digital's stock price is nearing its two year high which is also is all-time high as shown below:(Click to enlarge)Western Digital hasn't announced the date of its upcoming earnings release, but it should occur sometime near the end of April, and with the stock price at a two-year high, if the company releases bad news, then the price of the stock could take a hit. To avoid a hit, an investor might consider the protected covered call position presented in the table above. The specific call option to sell is the 2012 Apr 41 at $1.89 and the put option to purchase is the 2012 Apr 37 at $0.32.

368611,25452,2012-02-15T13:32:35-05:00,,"We believe SanDisk (SNDK) offers a compelling risk/reward profile, with several upcoming catalysts following the company's recent earnings disappointment.When SanDisk reported its 4Q results on January 25th, the outlook was poorly received, with shares trading off 11.4%. Since then, it was reported SanDisk was cutting prices by 15% - in our view, a non-story, since SanDisk had already indicated they expected 1Q pricing to be soft.With shares trading at just over 6x 2012 EPS ex-cash (SanDisk has approximately $16 per share of net cash), we believe the deck has been cleared on bad news, and the company is set for upside surprises.We outline below several positive catalysts:SanDisk analyst day - On February 16th SanDisk will host its annual analyst day. With the bad news out of the way, it should be a generally upbeat day, with lots of excitement regarding the mainstream enterprise adoption of SSDs (solid-state drives). SanDisk CEO Sanjay Malhotra indicated that 2H12 will be the inflection point for SSDs so we anticipate a good deal of discussion regarding that opportunity. We believe that to the extent the company discusses NAND supply/demand dynamics, they will be more upbeat than on the 4Q call.Firming DRAM helps NAND - With SanDisk's price cut in the rearview, we expect better NAND pricing (or at least slower price degradation) over the course of 2012. We believe recent troubles in the DRAM industry, including the potential bankruptcy of Elpida, will result in firming DRAM prices - a positive for Micron (NASDAQ:MU), which, in anticipation of better pricing, has been trading dramatically higher (up 32%) year-to-date. Given the fungibility of DRAM/NAND capacity, a better DRAM price environment diminishes the motivation to shift DRAM capacity to NAND, and, on the margin, helps NAND pricing.Apple introductions - We expect the introduction of iPad3 and later this year, new flash drive only notebooks to drive excitement and demand in the flash sector. We would anticipate that notebook/ultrabook manufacturers will quickly have to react to Apple's introductions, driving additional demand - also, clearly a negative for Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC).Turning on Fab 5 - CFO Judy Bruner spoke at length on the 4Q call that Fab 5 would turn on no earlier than July. We expect that SanDisk will turn Fab 5 on in July, and when that news breaks, likely several months in advance, we anticipate a further positive reaction.We believe shares have about a 10% downside/60% upside over the next 6-9 months, at current levels. At 10% down, we'd expect the company to aggressively repurchase shares creating a floor in the stock, while 60% upside represents multiple expansion to 10x CY13 EPS plus cash. We would prefer to see the company in the market, aggressively repurchasing shares today - it would be massively accretive to earnings.While we have a favorable view on shares, we have one fairly meaningful concern. We were surprised by how emphatic management was about pushing out Fab 5. Historically, former CEO and co-founder Eli Harari spoke tirelessly about the price elasticity of NAND. Lower prices spurred adoption and opened new markets, and also shifted consumers to using higher capacities (ie a 4GB card instead of a 2GB card). If capacity came on too soon, it would result in a weak period followed by an explosive period. Perhaps we are reading too much into it, and SanDisk is merely timing the market. It's just somewhat strange that SanDisk wouldn't be prepared with more internal capacity in front of an ""inflection point"" for SSDs.This is something we'll monitor closely. Nonetheless, with shares at current levels, we believe the risk/reward is too compelling not to own.Disclosure: I am long SNDK.Additional disclosure: We conduct thorough research on our ideas, but our views are our own.  Please do your own research."
416411,24714,2012-03-07T03:15:35-05:00,,"Last fall, several high cap tech stocks were very undervalued, with forward P/E ratios less than ten and strong, credible growth expectations ahead of them. SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) appeared to be one of those recovering value stocks, but has recently faced some flat activity. In the past six months as of the close of March 6th trading, share price increased by a whopping 36.49 percent, but in the past month, shares are down 3.6 percent after bad earnings while the Nasdaq is up 9.83 percent.In this article, I analyze if SanDisk shares will rebound in the near future like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) shares or taper off into a downward trend like Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) shares. SanDisk produces a wide range of memory storage devices. The company is an industry leader and from my analysis, has two very important strengths that should lead it to sustained success: its distribution channels and its low cost leadership.There are three very notable attributes about SanDisk's distribution channels. First, it has a strong global reach with 57 percent of its sales being international and has at least a 28 percent market share in all parts of the world including a 34 percent market share in the United States and a 32 percent market share in Europe. Second, the company has a lot of relationships with consumer hardware companies including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung, HP, Dell (NYSE:DELL), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), Motorola, and HTC.When these companies' products are bought, they come equipped with a SanDisk storage device, so consumers become familiar with the SanDisk brand and are more likely to use the SanDisk memory devices. Third, the company's products have a very strong retail presence. SanDisk reports that its products are available at over 250,000 stores worldwide and are available at 19 of the top 20 consumer electronics retailers in the United States.SanDisk's strong distribution channels and leadership in market share allow it to achieve its second major stregnth, low cost leadership. Memory storage devices are slowly becomming more of a commodity in that many companies produce a similar product. SanDisk, however, is able to use its high cash flow and position at the front of the market to fund research to cut costs and stay ahead of its competitors. This way, it can outprice them, maintain and expand on its market share, and increase revenues and profits.SanDisk stock looks undervalued based on what analysts expect the company to do in the coming years. In 2012, it is expected to report earnings per share of $4.69 and in 2013, it is expected to have an EPS of $5.47. SanDisk is expected to grow by 16.44 percent per year over the next five years while the S&P 500 is only expected to grow by 10.68 percent per year. However, SanDisk currently trades at a P/E ratio far below the S&P average of 14.5.The stock is undervalued because of potential concerns in the industry. The amount of new memory storage space needed every year is decreasing. This has stemmed from computer hardware technology beginning to mature as opposed to its exponential rate of growth over the past 30 years. In addition, the cost of a gigabyte of storage gets exponentially cheaper over time. A flattening demand for storage space means an exponentially decreasing stream of revenue.However, there is hope for SanDisk going forward. With mobile internet technology still developing, and new ways of using mobile internet continuing to emerge, there is still plenty of growth potential for the amount of data that is transmitted and SanDisk expects to grow mostly through its storage devices that will enable mobile computing. The company's 2015 revenue projection predicts no growth in revenue from consumers, but does expect 19.8 percent annual revenue growth in mobile memory storage and SSD storage sales.I believe that despite its earnings estimates posing high expectations, SanDisk is currently an undervalued stock. I believe that it is a good stock for anyone's portfolio and I personally value shares around $58, while it is currently trading at $48.50. Although the company sells a product that many seem to be ""just"" a commodity, its strong distribution channels and low cost leadership will most likely make SanDisk a market leader for years to come.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The consensus estimate is $1.26 for EPS and $1.57B for revenue, according to First Call. Last quarter, the company beat estimates by 12c, marking the fourth straight quarter of beating estimates. SanDisk expects the growing demand for its products to continue and supply to remain unhindered. Hence, the company forecasted for Q4 revenue of $1.5B-$1.6B. SanDisk expects Q4 gross margin to remain depressed due to Fab 5 start-up costs and currency exchange. The company expects non-GAAP product gross margin of 38%-40%, and total non-GAAP gross margin, including license and royalty, of 42%-44%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are forecasted at $225M-$235M, with the expected increase coming primarily from growth in the R&D investment level, and a seasonal increase in sales and marketing spending. SanDisk guided FY11 CapEx to $1.4B-$1.6B -- seeing significant investments in Q4 for both 24-nanometer and 19-nanometer technology transitions and Fab 5 capacity ramp. Deutsche Bank expects benign pricing environment to be a slight tailwind to margins and EPS and deliver modest upside to Deutshe's EPS but largely in-line with the Street. The firm believes demand overall was solid but with many cross currents in the quarter, it doesn't expect much revenue upside. For Q1, Deutsche expects a better than seasonal quarter. Deutsche believes the NAND market will remain in supply and demand balance through early 2012 as incremental demand from SSDs offset typical seasonal declines in retail markets. Consensus for 2012 is $5.07 on $6.65B in revenue."
417531,22263,2012-03-07T11:18:26-05:00,,"The Market on Friday (March 2) savaged Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) on news that the Chinese Commerce Dept had imposed many conditions on their proposed takeover of Hitachi's Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Business.As seen (WDC versus market for 5 days), this shows a steep rise followed by a decline on unusiually high volume (almost twice daily trading volume on Friday March 2 when news released) as the news was digested.First there was an article illustrating their proposed divestiture of some HDD assets to satisfy Monopoly concerns. Then, a translated copy of an article, published and disseminated during the course of trading by the Chinese government, which discussed their reservations and objections to the merger/takeover (note: this is a computer-generated google translation with grammatical errors).Admittedly it reads like the overall benefits of a business combination are severely compromised. However, further digging reveals that Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) had virtually the same conditions imposed on their takeover (by the Chinese government) of Samsung's HDD division. This was passed and consummated in Dec 2011.I read the reservations and conditionality from the China Commerce Department carefully, for both STX and WDC.They are very similar:The only difference? STX can request to have above conditions removed after 1 year. The application may or may not be accepted by Chinese Government. For WDC, the application date is after 2 years.The Market loved the STX news, and most importantly, their subsequent earnings announcement in January 2012 did not reveal any huge operational problems in complying with the above. In fact since the Samsung takeover the share price is up 64% this year-to-date. See 1-year chart below on comparison of the two:My ConclusionThis will be digested positively by the market for Western Digital, once the dust settles after the knee-jerk negative jolt. It is overwhelmingly positive that the deal is happening, and we are moving to a secular lift in profit margins for the Hard Disk Drive Indusry. HDD's are the bedrock of the digital highway. Whatever iPhone or photo taken on whatever device, it ends up being stored on a Hard Disk Drive as the preferred, cost-efficient medium of the digital highway. Pure and simple.60% of world capacity was wiped out in Thai floods. Unfortunate as it was, this had drawn financial minds to the importance of HDDs. A complex substrate, a precision magnetic storage element, a disk spinning at 7200 revs per minute, these are the elements, the skill, the R&D, required to make that storage space that we all take so for granted. After the floods, we have to rebuild capacity. We realize the costs. We see the shortage. We see prices rising by 100%, even 200% at the retail level. So what do we do as HDD suppliers?We realize that the complexity and importance of our product has been grossly under-appreciated. We realize that if the Average Selling Price (NYSE:ASP) was $45 before the floods; we can now get $75. Why? Because there is no alternative. The rumours swirling of late, that Solid State Drives would render HDDs redundant, are negated. The industry and market have realized that a SSD medium storing 250 Gigabytes costs more, much more, by a factor of 3 and higher as you move up the storage size. The world finally gets it.So we as HDD manufacturers finally have gained world acknowledgment for what we do, the brains and sweat and machines that go into making that Hard Drive. And we, as the manufacturers, are grateful that it is finally acknowledged. And we make sure the intrinsic price of our HDD drive stays above $65 into perpetuity.This is a once-in-a-lifetime-opportunity for the industry to earn respectable gross margins. The industry has consolidated from 6 to 3 players in the last two years.The time is now to stake our rightful claim to a decent return on capital, return on sweat, return on brains.Yes, we've heard of Apple or Intel. And their operating margins stay above 40 even 50%. Now we HDD manufacturers can do it too.To Western Digital specifically: Western Digital you made 32% operating margins this last December quarter. If you don't ensure it stays above 30% for perpetuity, given the consolidation in the supplier space, given the fundamental supply/demand imbalance in the future -- if you don't, then you deserve to slog and slave for the rest of your days.Disclosure: I am long WDC."

The results are typically released close to 4:05 p.m. EST and will follow with a conference call at 5:00 p.m. Sandisk shares rallied in after-hours trading on Tuesday after Apple (AAPL) reported a blowout quarter. For its part, Sandisk supplies NAND flash memory to Apple. Outliers & StrategyRecent NewsTechnical ReviewSandisk shares recently flirted with the 52-week high of $53.60 (10/28/2011) - a potential resistance barrier in the event of a stronger than expected earnings release. Other positive signals include the now upward-sloping MACD and the recent crossover of the 20-Day SMA above the slower 50-Day SMA - indications of improving momentum. Should earnings disappoint or fail to meet the high end of expectations, initial support is at the aforementioned 50-Day SMA near $49.50, with further downside risk to $47.50 and the 200-Day SMA near $45.00. (Chart courtesy of StockCharts.com)SummarySandisk shares are sharply higher since late summer, benefiting from increased NAND demand, a strong relationship with Apple, a suite of new products, takeover speculation, stabilizing handset volumes in Europe, and forecasts for stable seasonal price declines entering 2012. With expectations this high, Sandisk needs to deliver earnings and revenues at the high end of Street forecasts in order to sustain the advance.

321788,20568,2012-01-24T18:14:10-05:00,,"SanDisk Corp. (SNDK)  is scheduled to announce its fourth quarter fiscal 2011 results on  January 25, 2012 after market close, and we do not see any variation in  the analysts’ estimates at this point.Looking BackSanDisk posted impressive third quarter 2011 earnings of $1.10 per  share, handily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 13 cents. The  improved earnings were attributable to strong revenue growth. Increasing  demand for SanDisk’s flash memory products in the emerging markets, as  well as solid performance by its retail and OEM (original equipment  manufacturer) channels globally helped the company post a 14.8%  year-over-year revenue growth.Despite the higher revenue growth rate, margins came in below the  year-ago level, mostly due to the negative impact of the yen exchange  rate, start-up cost for a new fab as well as price declines. All these  factors tempered the positive effect of cost control measures.Fourth Quarter & Fiscal 2011 OutlookManagement expects the current capacity expansion commitment within  Phase I of Fab 5 to be completed by the end of January 2012 and future  Phase I expansion to begin approximately three months later. With this  capacity plan, management expects 2012 captive bit growth rate to be a  tad higher than  the 2011 level, and the key drivers of the 2012 bit  growth are expected to be the 19-nanometer technology transition, and  the wafer capacity expansion in Fab 5.SanDisk also expects the growing demand for its products to continue  and supply to remain unhindered. Hence, the company forecasts fourth  quarter revenue of between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion.SanDisk expects the fourth quarter gross margin to remain depressed due  to Fab 5 start-up costs and currency exchange. The company expects  non-GAAP product gross margin of 38% to 40%, and total non-GAAP gross  margin, including license and royalty, of 42% to 44%. Non-GAAP operating  expenses are forecasted at $225 million to $235 million, with the  expected increase coming primarily from growth in the R&D investment  level, and a seasonal increase in sales and marketing spending.Agreement of AnalystsAnalysts believe that the NAND flash market remains highly elastic with  solid industry consumption growth due to new applications such as solid  state drives in notebooks, PCs, Web tablets, smartphones, etc., soaking  up any significant increments in NAND flash capacity. While Samsung,  Toshiba/SanDisk, and Micron/Intel have innovated new 20-25nm fabs, the  analysts believe that the fabs may not start high-volume production in  the near term.According to some analysts, industry capacity additions of 30% to 40%  from all the major players (Samsung, Toshiba/SanDisk, Micron/Intel, and  Hynix) will put more pressure on ASPs and margins during 2011. Moreover,  they believe that higher fab-5 start-up costs and slightly more  aggressive pricing trends will pressure margins in 2011.Out of the five and seven analysts providing estimates for the fourth  quarter and fiscal 2011, none revised the estimates over the last thirty  days. However, one out of the seven analysts providing estimates for  fiscal 2012 made an upward revision in the past 30 days.The unchanged estimates point to the fact that there were no major  catalysts during the quarter that could drive results. Consequently,  analysts are more or less sticking to the estimates projected post-third  quarter earnings and are of the opinion that SanDisk will deliver  fourth quarter results in line with their expectations.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsOver the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimates for the fourth  quarter and fiscal 2011 have moved down a penny and 2 cents to $1.23 and  $4.47, respectively. Estimates have also been lowered by 4 cents for  the fiscal 2012 to $4.94.Our TakeThe current pricing scenario in the memory market seems to be unruly.  The ongoing oversupply in the market is bringing about a continuous  decline in memory pricing. Though NAND Flash memory is in a somewhat  better position than DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory), it is also  seeing pricing decline.Despite management’s decent fourth quarter guidance, we believe that  the oversupply situation coupled with the muted cost reduction effort  could put SanDisk’s margins under pressure.But we are positive about the growing demand for flash memory backed by the popularity of smartphones and tablets such as Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL)  iPad. Moreover, with the acquisition of Pliant Technology, SanDisk has  made its foray into the booming enterprise flash memory market.Currently, SanDisk has a short-term Buy recommendation, as indicated by the Zacks #2 Rank.AAPL: Free stock analysis reportSNDK: Free stock analysis report"

Analysts' consensus estimate is 71c for EPS and $1.84B for revenue, according to First Call. The preannouncement by Western Digital's competitor, Seagate (NASDAQ:STX), suggested that HDD vendors may have benefited from significantly larger than previously expected price increases. Western Digital's margin may have benefited form these price increases. Nevertheless, since Western Digital's facilities sustained more severe flooding than those of Seagate, Western Digital's recovery efforts will take center stage on the earnings call. Western Digital was more severely affected by the Thailand floods than any other HDD company, with about 60% of its HDD assembly capacity located in flooded areas. Management provided Q2 revenue guidance on Dec. 2 of 'at least' $1.8B. The company also predicted that its gross margins would be above the high-end of its guidance range of 18%-23%, but it did not provide explicit EPS guidance. Management predicts that Q2 charges from the Thailand flood will come in between $225M-$275M. Although no detail about expected shipment volumes was given, the company on October 19 had predicted that it would ship 22M-26M units. For Q2, Western Digital expects to take acquisition related charges of approximately $15M. The company will be vigorously contesting an arbitration decision, announced last November, in its legal dispute with Seagate, and Western Digital has not yet determined the accounting treatment associated with this matter. Analysts' consensus estimates for Western Digital are 91c on $2.05B of revenue for Q3, and $4.13 on $9.30B of revenue for FY12."

Moreover, the company’s market share grew by approximately 30 basis points sequentially and 190 basis points year-on-year. The company witnessed strong consumer activity than what is witnessed seasonally.Geographically, demand in Asia was particularly strong in the quarter, contributing about 59.0% of the revenue, up from 54.0% in the prior year. Europe generated about 22.0% of revenue, decreasing 100 basis points from the prior year but up from the 20% reported in the June quarter. America, with 19.0% of revenue, declined from 23.0% in the year-ago quarter and from 20.0% reported in the June quarter.Gross margin in the reported quarter was 20.1% versus 18.2% in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year increase was attributable to the stable pricing environment. Moreover, product mix was favorable. Effective cost management and improved utilization also enabled the company to reach the higher end of the gross margin guidance.The company generated $352.0 million of cash from operations in the quarter, down from $447.0 million in the previous quarter. Cash and cash equivalents were $3.67 billion, up from $3.49 billion reported in the previous quarter. The company made debt repayment of $31.0 million during the quarter, thereby reducing its debt balance to $263.0 million.Agreement of AnalystsOut of the 16 analysts providing estimates for the second quarter, one analyst revised its estimates upward over the last thirty days. For fiscal 2012 and 2013, one and two analysts revised their EPS upward over the last 30 days.As per some analysts, the upward revision in guidance by the hard disk major Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) has had a notable impact on sentiments regarding Western Digital. Seagate has made revisions to its sales and gross margins which are significantly higher than prior projections. The analysts expect the December quarter shipments of HDD to be 47 million units, which included 700,000 units manufactured by Samsung, up from the previous guidance of 43 million.This is expected to result in better component availability. Some analysts believe that Western Digital's recovery may be running somewhat ahead of investor expectations now resulting in a drive TAM of 128 to 132 million units for the December quarter. This is a meaningful improvement from their previous expectation.Analysts are of the opinion that most of Seagate's drive shipments went to OEMs last quarter, Western Digital being one of the primary supplier influencing the distribution and retail channels. As price increases for some of the hard disk products went up to 100%, Western Digital raised its sales guidance.Some analysts believe that Western Digital is the most well managed company in the HDD space, and they expect very attractive free cash flow and ROIC, even amidst limited HDD industry unit growth. Moreover, the analysts also state that the Street doesn’t fully appreciate the long-term benefits of the Hitachi Global Storage (HGST) acquisition. They contend that if the accretion potential of the deal is not fully factored in.Magnitude of Estimate Revisions Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the second quarter moved up by a penny to 71 cents. For fiscal year 2012 and 2013, the analysts’ estimates have moved up by 9 cents and 14 cents, respectively, to $4.19 and $5.05, respectively.Our Take Western Digital’s first quarter 2012 results exceeded our expectations, with total sales improving substantially over the year-ago period. The company is trying to lower its interest expense by reducing the debt burden, whereas the improvement in pricing environment is expected to result in better margins. Although Western Digital is sitting on a cash pile, its cash generation ability has been tempered to an extent by a difficult business environment in Europe.Moreover, the Hitachi deal is expected to strengthen its foothold in the data storage business. Although the company has been able to handle competition efficiently, bigger players like Fujitsu Ltd (OTCPK:FJTSF), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) pose a considerable challenge.Currently, Western Digital has a Zacks #2 Rank, implying a short-term Buy rating.SEAGATE TECH (STX): Free Stock Analysis Report WESTERN DIGITAL (WDC): Free Stock Analysis Report"

Below we can see the results of Western Digital Corp. over the last few earnings periods.Western Digital Corporation, through its subsidiaries, provides solutions for the collection, storage, management, protection, and use of digital content primarily audio and video worldwide. The company was founded in 1970 and is headquartered in Irvine, California. WDC trades an average of 3.1 million shares per day.52 Week High: $41.8752 Week Low: $22.64Book Value: $24.46Float Short: 2.06%On average, 16 analysts are expecting a drop of $-0.39 in earnings per share compared to last quarter's results of $1.10. A beat of $0.71 per share will top the estimated mean earnings. Analyst estimates range between $0.58 and $0.90 per share.The P/E ratio has been discounted, as the current trailing twelve months P/E ratio is 9.8, while the forward P/E ratio is now 7.97. An upside earnings report may put a lot of wind in the sails. I am bullish on Western Digital short term and long term. In the short term, the stock broke higher, above the 200-day moving average. The shorter-term moving averages are now trending higher as well. The PE is about as dirt cheap as you could possibly want for a well-known, respected company. Supply issues in the industry will work themselves out, and I believe any breaks in share price should be viewed as a buying oppertunity.For the same fiscal period year-over-year, revenue has declined to $9.53 billion for 2011 vs. $9.85 billion for 2010. The bottom line has falling earnings year-over-year of $726.00 million for 2011 vs. $1.38 billion for 2010.The company's earnings before interest and taxes are falling with an EBIT year-over-year of $781.00 million for 2011 vs. $1.53 billion for 2010. Lower revenue along with a drop in earnings is often one of the last signs to get out of the way of a falling stock price.Here is a look at the fiscal year revenue:Gross reported revenue compared to the mean estimate (rounded):M = millions, B = billions.Differences are rounded.Some one-time items are often excluded in reported EPS.Reported earnings per share compared to the mean estimate.

313065,24199,2011-12-11T03:52:27-05:00,,"Western Digital Corporation (NYSE: WDC) is the world market leading hard drive manufacturer. The company supplies a range of drives used in devices from desktop and notebook computers to data centers, gaming platforms and other entertainment devices. The company also manufactures solid state drives, which is the fastest growing area of the storage device market. The company trades (as of 11/14) for a market cap of $6.22 billion of which $3.41 billion (55%) is net cash. Furthermore, the company has averaged free cash flows after acquisitions of $846 million over the last three years, representing an excellent ex-cash yield of 30%. The company has also enjoyed returns on equity averaging 33.5% over the last decade.Despite the company’s long track record of strong performance, its shares have taken a beating, falling by almost a third over the last six months. The market clearly believes the company’s future performance will not reflect its historical performance. It is our job to assess this for ourselves and determine whether there is a value opportunity.First, let’s look at the company’s historical revenue growth and margins. We do this in order to identify any possible trends which could help us in our predictions. For example, it would be a mistake to value a business using long term average margins if that company was experiencing secular contraction in its margins. Likewise, it would be folly to not account for revenues that appear to be in secular decline. Fortunately, neither appears to be the case here according to the following chart.Click to enlarge imagesWestern Digital Corp - Revenues and Margins, 1998 - 1Q 2012We see that the company has enjoyed rapidly growing revenues (though to be fair, much of the recent growth has been the result of acquisitions rather than organic). Margins have been a mixed bag over the last few years, as industry participants appear to have been caught making erroneous estimates of demand, which has led several times to overproduction and falling ASPs. Looking at the quarterly margins, we see a rapid decline beginning around 4Q 2010 and only beginning to recover in the recent quarter. This was largely the result of unexpectedly low demand resulting in increased pricing competition in a largely commoditized market.The following chart indicates the secular decline of the company’s average selling price per unit (a great example of deflation in the computing industry). At the same time, unit shipments have grown dramatically.Western Digital Corp - Unit Shipments and ASP, 1998 - 1Q 2012The next chart shows the dramatic growth in WDC’s market share over the last four years (source: WDC presentation [PDF]), from about 23% to around 33%. Growth in market share of this magnitude is impressive. As noted above, the company’s products are largely seen as a commodity (do you know the brand of the drive your computer? I highly doubt it.), so WDC was able to grow its share mostly as a result of acquisitions, relationships and price competitiveness (economies of scale are important here). Keep this in mind, as we’ll discuss it again shortly.Western Digital Corp - Market Share, 4Q 2007 - 4Q 2011The next two charts show the company’s rapid growth in free cash flow and how cash has accumulated on the company’s balance sheet.Western Digital Corp - Cash Flows, 1998 - 1Q 2012Western Digital Corp - Capital Structure, 1998 - 1Q 2012Let’s sum up what we’ve see here so far. Despite the highly competitive nature of the industry, the company has managed to grow revenues and free cash flows in the face of declining ASPs. The company has successfully grown market share in this environment and maintains an extremely conservative balance sheet.So going back to the beginning, why is the company cheap relative to free cash flows? After all, there are no obvious negative trends. Three potential reasons emerge.1. Declining DemandThis argument has received less coverage in the last few months, but it was all the rage last year when WDC was trading for roughly the same price. Various commentators hypothesized that demand for hard drives would fall into secular decline, as solid state drives rise in prominence and laptops and netbooks are replaced by tablet PCs. In the shorter term, it was supposed that consumer demand would continue to surprise to the downside, leading to continued growth in inventory and weak pricing power. No one is really discussing this anymore, because there is little evidence to support it (at least not yet). As the company notes in its recent quarterly conference call (emphasis added):2. Flooding in ThailandBeginning this past summer, Thailand has experienced the worst flooding in fifty years. I won’t rehash the full extent, but for those interested this Wikipedia article provides details. Pertinent to this discussion is the fact that two of WDC’s major manufacturing facilities and an unknown number of plants for its suppliers have been crippled. This NYTimes article provides some details about the impact on WDC and other manufacturers, and the company’s filings and conference calls have provided important information as well.Unfortunately, WDC appears to be hardest hit of the major manufacturers (though, I have not seen anything that has taken into account the full supply chain). A few things to note. From the conference call, it appears the company is insured for this situation (though the extent of coverage is unknown).From this, it appears we can limit the losses to lost profit as a result of the company’s inability to meet demand while reconstruction takes place. The company has been consistently confident in its ability to recover quickly, though we might expect up to a year before the company is back at full capacity (hopefully taking this as an opportunity to better diversify its manufacturing). We’ll take this into account in our model.Some are now suggesting that this interim period, whereby competitors will be able to capitalize on WDC’s weakness in order to expand their own market share, will become permanent as OEMs and other customers decide to stick with WDC’s competitors even as WDC regains its full capacity. I see little evidence to support this. Recall above that WDC has managed to grow its market share quite rapidly throughout the recession, in the face of heightened competition and an industry-wide inventory glut. I expect any permanent shift to be quite small.One thing to note is that this destruction in capacity might present an opportunity for the industry. In the months leading up to the flooding, analysts peppered management with questions about inventory growth and many pointed to growing inventories as a sign that ASPs would continue to fall (this goes to the doom and gloom scenario above). This temporary decline in supply has reportedly already had the effect of boosting prices throughout the industry. One might suggest that decreased capacity wouldn’t be the worst thing for this industry, and could lead to the return of pricing power.3. Hitachi GST AcquisitionThis is the big one. In March, WDC announced it had reached an agreement to acquire Hitachi Global Storage Technologies in a $4.25 billion transaction. The deal includes $3.5 billion in cash and 25 million WDC common shares (valued at the time at $30.01 each). Though the $3.5 billion is being funded in part with the addition of $2.5 billion of debt, the effect on net cash is the same. Post-transaction, the company will have $3.5 billion less of net cash (recall from above that the company has just $3.41 billion in net cash, so the effect is quite extraordinary, and in the wrong direction).According to this investor summary (pdf), HGST is the #3 player overall (compared to #1 for WDC) and #2 in the mobile 2.5″ HDD market (compared to #1 for WDC). Additionally, this acquisition will give WDC the #2 position (currently a tiny #4) in the Traditional Enterprise market. The deal is still subject to regulatory review (as at the time of writing, though this may be resolved by the time this is published).There should be significant cost synergies in terms of R&D, and on the recent conference call, WDC management suggested that the acquisition will help them return to full operating capacity much more quickly. Additionally, this should go a long way toward reducing the level of competition that exists in the industry, which should support pricing power.Either way, in building our models, it is important to take into account the effect of this acquisition on the company’s valuation, both in terms of net cash reduction and expense synergies as well as our projections of units shipped and ASPs.ConclusionWhen I included the effects of acquiring Hitachi GST and the short-term impact of the flooding in Thailand, I find that WDC appears excessively cheap.What do you think of WDC?Disclosure: No position, but may initiate within the next 72 hours."
301267,20568,2011-10-21T17:28:56-04:00,,"SanDisk Corp.’s (SNDK)  third quarter 2011 adjusted earnings of $1.15 per share surpassed the  Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. The adjusted or non-GAAP earnings per  share exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets,  convertible debt interest and tax gains, but include stock-based  compensation expense. Shares surged 2.29% in after market trade.RevenueTotal revenue for the third quarter was $1.42 billion, up 14.8% on a  year-over-year basis. The quarter’s result was on the higher end of the  company’s guidance range. Sales of Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad and iPhone as well as smartphones using Google Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG)  Android platform have been the bright spot. As flash memory is used in  these gadgets, the demand for the same is surging. The revenue growth  was driven by strong demand for SanDisk’s flash memory products in  emerging markets, as well as solid performance by its retail and OEM  (original equipment manufacturer) channels, globally.Segment wise, Product revenue increased 16.2% year over year to $1.32  billion, while License and Royalty revenue was $94.1 million, down 2.1%  year over year.Operating ResultsReported gross margin in the quarter was 43.2% versus 51.8% in the  year-ago quarter. The decline is attributable to the 850 basis point  year-over-year decrease in the product gross margin.The margin decline was due to the negative impact of the yen exchange  rate, start-up cost for a new fab as well as price declines. All these  factors tempered the positive effect of cost control measures.Operating margin on a GAAP basis was 27.3%, compared with 35.0% in the  year-ago quarter. The company’s total operating expenses increased 9.0%  on a year-over-year basis. Steeper operating expenses were mainly an  outcome of a 21.3% year-over-year increase in research and development  (R&D) costs, partially offset by reduction in sales and marketing  and general and administrative costs.Net income on a GAAP basis was $233.3 million, or 96 cents per diluted  share, compared with $322.1 million, or $1.34 per share in the year-ago  quarter.Excluding the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets,  convertible debt interest expense and related tax adjustments, but  including stock-based compensation expense, non-GAAP net income for the  third quarter was $279.6 million, or $1.15 per diluted share, compared  with $316.3 million, or $1.31, in the year-ago quarter.Balance Sheet & Cash FlowSanDisk generated $176.3 million in cash from operating activities,  compared with $269.2 million in the prior quarter. Capital expenditure  was $52.9 million. Cash and short-term investments were $2.55 billion  versus $2.69 billion in the previous quarter. Huge cash used in  investing activities have lowered the cash balance for the reported  quarter. Convertible long-term debt for the quarter was $1.58 billion,  down from $1.76 billion in the previous quarter. Long-term marketable  securities were $2.71 billion.Fourth Quarter & Fiscal 2011 OutlookManagement expects the current capacity expansion commitment within  Phase I of Fab 5 to be completed by the end of January 2012 and future  Phase I expansion to begin approximately three months later. With this  capacity plan, management expects 2012 captive bit growth rate to be  somewhat higher than in 2011, and the key drivers of the 2012 bit growth  to be the 19-nanometer technology transition, and the wafer capacity  expansion in Fab 5.SanDisk also expects that growing demand for its products to continue  and supply to remain unhindered. Hence, the company forecasts fourth  quarter revenue between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion.SanDisk expects the fourth quarter gross margin to remain depressed due  to Fab 5 start-up costs and currency exchange. The company expects  non-GAAP product gross margin of 38% to 40%, and total non-GAAP gross  margin including license and royalty of 42% to 44%. Non-GAAP operating  expenses are forecast at $225 million to $235 million, with the expected  increase coming primarily from growth in the R&D investment level,  and a seasonal increase in sales and marketing spending.Our TakeSanDisk posted decent third quarter 2011 numbers surpassing the Zacks  Consensus Estimate. Both OEM and retail sides of the business  progressed, enabling solid product revenue. Though revenue guidance was  decent, margin guidance was disappointing, as SanDisk continued to see  memory price declines and currency headwinds.In a bid to expand into the fast-growing and high-margin business of  sophisticated flash storage for enterprise customers, SanDisk bought  solid-state drive maker Pliant Technology for $237 million, earlier this  year. With the acquisition, SanDisk made its foray into the booming  enterprise flash memory market.We understand that demand for flash memory could grow in the coming  years, backed by the popularity of devices such as smartphones and  tablets. But we think that slower cannibalization of PC could hurt the  demand for SanDisk’s memory products and rationalize revenue growth,  going forward. Also, customer concentration risk, competitive pressure  and European weakness are headwinds for the company.Currently, SanDisk holds a Zacks #4 Rank, implying a short-term Sell rating."
300834,21445,2011-10-20T12:39:28-04:00,,"SanDisk (SNDK) is expected to report Q3 earnings after the market close on Thursday, October 20, with a conference call scheduled for 5:00 pm ET.The consensus estimate is $1.07 for EPS and $1.42B for revenue, according to First Call. Guidance provided by management on its last earnings call was for Q3 revenue $1.375B-$1.425B, growth of 0%-4% quarter-over-quarter, below seasonal trends of 5%-10% quarter-over-quarter due to constrained NAND supply. Analyst sentiment has been waning recently, as the number of buy ratings has dropped slightly over the past three months.Wedbush is looking for a beat and in-line guide from SanDisk as the company benefits from favorable NAND supply/demand environment and strong demand for tablets and smartphones. However, going forward, Wedbush thinks the NAND supply environment may turn unfavorable in the latter part of Q4 and into 1H12, driven by the ramp of several NAND fabs during the seasonally weakest period for the NAND market. Wedbush believes the stock has created an opportunity for investors to take some profits, now that the peak seasonality for the NAND market will soon be behind SanDisk and the stock has risen 45% off its lows in August. Wedbush's industry checks indicate SanDisk is benefiting from ramp of Ultrabooks, client SSDs, tablets, and smartphones -- which should push guidance in-line with Street expectations of $1.21 on $1.58B for Q4, and FY12 $4.76/$6.62B. On SanDisk's last conference call, management indicated that it expected normal Q4 seasonality and tightened its FY11 revenue guidance range to $5.6B-$5.7B -- the upper-end of its prior guidance range of $5.3B-$5.7B."
311755,24178,2011-12-05T02:21:28-05:00,,"The bones of an articleOn November 16th, 2011 there just wasn’t enough time to do everything – something had to give. We were packing our bags for our trip to Istanbul, we had to be at the airport by 6:30 p.m., we were making last minute preparations, scribbling out notes for an article on Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) and stuffing investors' accounts with their shares as fast as we could. After listening to their Q1 2012 CC call twice [and then Seagate's (NASDAQ:STX)] and having read all of their 10Qs and annual reports for over a year, we were more convinced than ever that WDC had by far the superior management team, and with a confirmation of full insurance coverage including business continuity (that is to say, lost income) after the floods in Thailand, there was no doubt left in what we were doing with investors' money.Although we only needed the typical hour to knock off the article, it just wasn’t in the cards. By 2:30 p.m., amidst a flurry of phone calls and emails, we gave up on the idea that the article could be published that day, having scribbled out only the framework of an article.WDC was hardly new to us. Having studied it for over a year, including publishing two separate articles on the company (in one the future price of the shares was accurately forecast), and having purchased the shares in the past with what could be called at least “better than average” returns for investors, we just didn’t think we would see sub-25 pricing again in our lifetime. Then came the historic floods in Thailand.The timing of the sell-off in the shares of WDC was almost perfect - if irrational - we had just unloaded huge positions in Force Protection (NASDAQ:FRPT) even though we felt General Dynamic's (NYSE:GD) tender offer was too low. The way we saw it, our investors would just have to live with the 39.2% annualized return (47.6% better than the S&P 500) on the shares of FRPT we had just gotten them. Now sitting on a ton of investors' capital because of the highly concentrated position in FRPT and the related return, we had a very good idea about where to put at least part of it.We didn’t mind dumping the FRPT shares at only $5.52, although we understood there was a good chance the 17 or so shareholder lawsuits which would ultimately amass may well force GD to offer a price which more accurately reflected the correct appraisal of the company. The correct appraisal was published in several Amvona articles during 2011, and so amongst the other phone calls we were receiving that morning, we were also hearing from securities lawyers (who had read the Amvona articles) about the FRPT sale.We’re used to speaking to lawyers, but usually foreclosure defense lawyers. This has especially been the case after our legal analysis of the Bevilacqua case appears to have reached about ½ million people, thanks at least in part to Seeking Alpha featuring it twice on their home page (once in ""Market Currents"" and again as an “Editor's Pick”) and thus exposing it to their 50 million unique monthly readers. Countless other sites did the same and the article received many thousands of shares on Facebook as a result. We definitely weren’t making any apologies for the opinion either, especially when MA attorney general Martha Coakley's action vindicated nearly two years of our advocacy on behalf of MA homeowners.There appears to be an inverse relationship between how Amvona stock picks move up, and big banks stocks such as BAC, C, JPM, and WFC move down – perhaps the legal analysis (and the related readership) has contributed in some small way to the phenomenon.Lamenting that the WDC article couldn’t be published, and knowing the shares would soon rise, we got on our plane. When we arrived late in the evening at the Holy Monastery of Halki, on the Prince Island of Heybeliada - we went directly to greet our dear friend the Abbot, Metropolitan Elpidophoros of Bursa. By God’s providence, there was a Western Digital 2TB Caviar Black hard drive sitting on his coffee table (reminding us of the original Amvona article on Western Digital that pointed out that hard drives often need to be replaced). Picking up the drive we remarked to the Bishop that we had just started writing an article on the company that morning, but failed to get it published. We indicated that because of the floods in Thailand the price of HDDs would soon rise, and that the shares of the company were on sale without good cause (thinking of WDC's superior management and complete insurance coverage). He joked that maybe he should sell the drive; with a laugh, we suggested eBay.Put your life on it®That’s WDC’s tag line - although we would have been equally satisfied with, ""Put pictures of your son watching TV with the Ecumenical Patriarch on it"". Admittedly, the only problem with our suggested catchphrase is that it might be a little long for letterhead and business cards. Either way, it’s not hard to imagine that with such a slogan, the brand might involve at least some consumer trust and loyalty. Yet, the company books only a pittance for “Goodwill” on their balance sheet.So what is the real value of the company? At $25.65 per share the enterprise value (the important figure to a potential acquirer) of the company is only about 2.5 billion. Would anybody offer that price to acquire the entire company thinking it reflected reality? So why are buyers, or better yet sellers of ""shares"", so different?A few points to consider:1. Goodwill alone may be worth as much as 9 figures - how do we know? Because you wouldn't back up your home movies and financial data to an “Acme” hard drive either.2. At FYE 2011 the company threw off 756 million in free cash and almost the same amount in net profits – at that rate the buyer at the above price recoups his investment in 3.3 years – that is to say, they are generating 30% of their enterprise value each year in free cash flow (and 2011 wasn't an extraordinary year).3. Demand is growing, prices are rising and the industry is consolidating.Buying shares in a company through the stock market means acquiring a part of the entire business. Curiously, this often happens at a discount for no other reason than the fact the company has been divided into “shares”. That is to say, an outstanding business such as WDC can often be purchased on any given day at a pro-rata price well below what it would take to buy 100% of the company. When there is a shock to the company, even if its effects are fully insured, the market responds sometimes by ""giving away the farm.""A note on profitabilityA business’s profitability is determined by these three things:1. Its return on assets2. The cost of its liabilities3. If and how it uses “leverage.” This is to say the degree to which its assets are funded by liabilities rather than equity.Since there will soon be only two major players in the storage business (STX and WDC), it is worth comparing the two on these three basic points. We do not want to go into all the details here because the information is readily available online for free, but suffice to say, there really is no comparison.We don’t mean to scandalize the readers - but our $67 per share appraisal of WDC’s business on a day when shares were selling in the 25s had much less to do with crystal balls than with deductive reasoning.Coming HomeBy the time we returned to work on Nov. 29th, the shares had already risen substantially so we didn’t publish the intended article. Instead, we published our third article on Skechers (NYSE:SKX), which we had been buying for investors from our cell in the Monastery.The shares of WDC have now climbed about 30% since we started buying just over two weeks ago (although, as pointed out, they are likely nowhere near their real value, having told investors on Nov. 16th what we thought the company is worth). Nonetheless, we cannot relish in the glory because the article didn’t actually get published before the rebound, but our time at Halki more than makes up for the ego fest we would have enjoyed otherwise.In those days we saw such beauty and felt such peace as can scarcely be believed to exist any longer. We were blessed to have the opportunity to celebrate the liturgy in the chapel of the Holy Monastery with Metropolitan Elpidophoros and the Ecumenical Patriarch, witnessing the ordination of a worthy young man to the office of deacon, an event which had not taken place at the monastery for years (because of the Turkish government's enforced closure in 1971). Hardly a week later Vice President Biden would be there meeting with the Patriarch - the reopening of the school becoming a central theme of the discussion on freedom in the Arab world. It was like a miracle for Orthodoxy – it was to be part of history. Later we would also be privileged enough to be at the elevation of the first Metropolitan of Singapore in a marathon of Orthodox Liturgical beauty – we still could not believe that men with Constantine’s character and innocence still existed.One member of our party bemoaned the fact that we scarcely left the monastery, and therefore did not have an opportunity to visit the usual tourist sites such as Agia Sophia – but that meant nothing to us - for watching the innocence of a child encountering the living church in the person of the first Bishop of Eastern Orthodoxy was to understand more fully that where the bishop is, so also is the church. So it was that empty buildings and egotistical articles came to mean nothing, and with this conclusion we decided to publish our article anyway - having first safely backed up the images from our trip onto a Western Digital hard drive.Here is what the benchmarked returns for WDC look like as of Friday December 2nd, 2011:The following are the rough notes that would have been our article on WDC back on November 16th, 2011 (it is entirely in rough form). It was frantically scribbled out (as partial thoughts or incomplete sentences) – it is the unedited and unrefined way we think about securities when they are purchased and before they are packaged for mass consumption into nice neat articles… perhaps those fragments still have some small value. Most of what was seen so clearly on that day (as below), has since come to pass precisely as envisioned.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

298982,20568,2011-10-11T19:21:02-04:00,,"SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) is scheduled to announce its third quarter fiscal 2011 results on October 20 after market close, and we do not see much variation in analyst estimates at this point.Second Quarter OverviewSanDisk’s second quarter 2011 adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 97 cents. The adjusted or non-GAAP earnings per share exclude amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, operating expense adjustments, convertible debt interest and tax gains, but includes stock-based compensation expense.Sandisk reported total revenue for the second quarter of $1.38 billion, up 16.6% on a year-over-year basis. The revenue growth was driven by strong demand for SanDisk’s flash memory products in emerging markets, as well as strong performance by its retail and OEM (original equipment manufacturer) channels, globally.Segment wise, Product revenue increased 17.5% year over year to $1.28 billion, while License and Royalty revenue was $93.0 million, up 6.0% year over year.Product gross margin in the quarter was 41.3% on a non-GAAP basis versus 42.4% in the year-ago quarter. Total gross margin decreased 140 basis points year over year to 45.3%. The margin decline was due to the negative impact of the yen exchange rate, start-up cost for a new fab as well as price declines.All these factors tempered the positive effect of cost control measures. Operating margin on a non-GAAP basis was 29.2%, compared with 31.9% in the year-ago quarter. The company’s total operating expenses increased 24.8% on a year-over-year basis.SanDisk generated $269.2 million in cash from operating activities, compared with $398.6 million in the prior quarter. Cash and short-term investments were $2.69 billion versus $2.97 billion in the previous quarter.Agreement Of AnalystsOut of the six analysts providing estimates for the third quarter, none revised estimates over the last 30 days. Again for the fiscal year 2011 and 2012, none of the analysts made a meaningful revision.The unchanged estimates point to the fact that there were no major catalysts during the quarter that could drive results. Consequently, analysts are more or less sticking to the estimates projected post-second quarter earnings and are of the opinion that SanDisk will deliver third quarter results in line with their expectations.Some analysts are of the opinion that SanDisk remains the world’s largest semiconductor vendor and are also convinced about the fact that SNDK as well as the NAND industry are controlling supply in a mature manner. The analysts also believe that, even amidst a likely global slowdown, the demand storyline is expanding.First there was the iPad, iPhone and the MacBook Air, but now they are about to be joined by an instant-on tablet-laptop hybrid, i.e., Intel''s (NASDAQ:INTC) Ultrabook, with high input output operations per second (IOPS), and by Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) KindleFire and by multiple smart phone launches.Some other analysts are of the opinion that SanDisk has recently added significant testing capacity solely dedicated to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). This suggests market share gains ahead for SanDisk, likely at the expense of Samsung (OTC:SSNLF).Analysts believe that the NAND flash supply outlook is more positive than a quarter ago. NAND flash suppliers including Samsung (but with the exception of Hynix) have reduced second-half capacity ramp plans, which could result in less than 80% bit supply growth for the year.Magnitude Of Estimate Revisions Over the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the third quarter has moved up by 2 cents to $4.26. However, over the last 60 days, estimates have been lowered by 1 cent for the third quarter and raised by 19 cents for the fiscal year 2012.Our Take SanDisk posted decent second quarter 2011 numbers, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Both OEM and retail sides of the business progressed, resulting in solid product revenue. Though revenue guidance was decent, margin guidance was disappointing, as SanDisk continued to see memory price declines and currency headwinds.We understand that demand for flash memory could grow in the coming years, backed by the popularity of devices such as smart phones and tablets such as Apple's iPad. But we think that slower cannibalization of PCs could hurt the demand for SanDisk’s memory products and rationalize revenue growth, going forward. Customer concentration risk, competitive pressures and European weakness are other headwinds for the company.Considering the above factors, we feel our short-term Sell recommendation on SanDisk is justified, as indicated by the Zacks #4 Rank."

The real business end of a computer is what most people never see: The hard drive. This is where data and software is stored and what enables the PC to function. Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) is a market leader in this arena, marketing its products to computer manufacturers and retailers.Western Digital shares are currently trading around $26, and the mean 12 month price target from analysts researching the stock is $41.06 (a 58% upside potential). The stock is trading below its 50-day exponential moving average of $33.59, and its 200-day exponential moving average of $34.48. The stock has fallen away from its 12-month high of $41.87 set in April, and this fall increased in pace with the declines in the broader market seen in August. Further declines have been seen in the stock after flooding in Thailand wiped out its facilities there. The company has said that it does not expect to resume operations in Thailand for several quarters, and has forecast a loss this quarter. Shares have bounced from their 12-month low of $22.64 in the last couple of days, but with flooding now expected to continue for at least another month, this bounce is likely to be short-lived.Earnings per share for the last 12 months are $3.26, and prior to this natural disaster, these were expected to reach $4.00 in Western Digital's next fiscal year (ending Jun 2013). These numbers place the shares on a trailing price to earnings ratio of 7.96, and a forward multiple of 6.49.Western Digital has said that it expects to lose sales. Competitors such as Toshiba Corp (OTCPK:TOSBF) and Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) have said that their factories in Thailand are safe and they will benefit. The share prices of these two companies have reacted accordingly; where Western Digital has fallen, they have risen.Current operating margin at Western Digital is 8.61%, with a return on assets of 6.56% and a return on equity of 14.44%. These numbers will be hit in the next few quarters as the Thailand floods take their toll.Analysts had expected a profit per share of $1.04 for the quarter ending in December. The company has now given guidance of a loss between $1.10 and $1.50, on revenue seen at no more than $1.25 billion versus previous forecasts of $2.58 billion. Read more here.Click chart to enlarge: Looking at the 12-month chart, we see that shareholders were already suffering as the weakening economy were likely to dampen sales of PC’s and therefore revenues at Western Digital. I see no reason to buy the shares at the current level. Sales migrating to other hard drive manufacturers may be difficult to regain in the future. To do so may require large price discounts. This would hurt revenues and margins when the company’s operations in Thailand can be resumed. There may be a high degree of volatility in the share price going forward, and potential investors should be wary that any share price rises may be a false dawn and short lived. Sell.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Several technology gorillas are holding important events. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are each holding developers  conferences, both of which have aroused very high expectations, because,  at both of them, important developments in the computing world for the  next few years will be unveiled, or at least discussed.In addition,  Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Juniper Networks (NYSE:JNPR) will hold analysts meetings  this week, and RIM (RIMM) will report results on Thursday after the  close.At Microsoft's event, a first real glimpse is expected of  the W8 operating system, which will be launched next year. Among other  things, it is supposed to take a large chunk of the tablet computer  market, where Microsoft has had no presence up to now. At Intel's event,  CEO Paul Otellini is expected to repeat his optimistic estimates for  the global computers market, resting on very high demand from developing  countries such as China, India, and Brazil, despite the slowdown in the  West. He will apparently talk about strong demand for server  processors, because of the information explosion, and the move to cloud  computing.At both events, the next leap forward in laptop  computers will be presented: faster booting, alongside substantial  longer time between battery charges. Shmuel (""Mooly"") Eden, vice  president, and general manager of Intel Corporation's PC Client Group,  will present the new family of laptop computers based on Intel's  advanced processors, the Ultra Book, which is now reaching the market.  He first unveiled them at an event in Taiwan in May, and said then that  Intel hoped that it would quickly take 40% of the laptop market.With  the help of a NAND-based solid state drive (SSD), and from next year  with the W8 operating system, booting these computers will take just a  few seconds instead of the long and frustrating process of today, while  battery time will be substantially longer. When two gorillas, Intel and  Microsoft, base their future computers largely on NAND, following on  from Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) new ultra-thin laptops, it's no wonder that shares  in SanDisk (SNDK) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) started moving northwards  last week.This evening, at a conference held by Rodman & Renshaw in New York, Attunity CEO Shimon Alon will explain the acquisition of RepliWeb for a net sum  of $7.8 million, which was reported last week. While Attunity  specializes in real-time retrieval from databases, the acquired company  specializes in automatic and secure retrieval of content outside of  enterprise databases. Together, they present a complete and better  solution for cloud computing, and for enterprise information systems in  general.RepliWeb has over 1,500 customers worldwide, including  governments and giant companies in all kinds of fields. In 2010, it had  sales of $8 million, half from services and half from license sales. The  acquisition takes place just as Attunity starts work on a multi-million  dollar cloud computing project for Microsoft, for which it will receive  an advance of $3.5 million this month. The expansion of its  capabilities with this acquisition should help Attunity in the future  vis-à-vis Microsoft and other giants, such as Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), a  longstanding customer.Published by Globes [online], Israel business news - www.globes-online.com - on September 12, 2011Reprinted on Seeking Alpha with permission; © Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd. 2011Disclosure: No positions"

The consensus estimate is 99c for EPS and $1.34B for revenue, according to First Call. Guidance provided by management on its last earnings call is for Q2 revenue of $1.3B-$1.35B and gross margin similar to Q1. Wedbush expects SanDisk to likely report Q2 results that are largely in-line with Street expectations, driven by favorable NAND pricing. Wedbush stated that even though we are heading into the seasonally strongest period for NAND flash, it thinks consumer demand trends, outside of tablets and smartphones, particularly the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) phenomena, will likely be below typical seasonality for retail flash memory cards and USB drives. Wedbush is also concerned that increased NAND supply could cause ASPs to decline above historical trends. While SanDisk's strategic acquisition of Pliant bolstered Wedbush's long-term view, the firm is concerned that Q3 outlook could potentially disappoint and look for guidance in-line with its below-Street estimates of $1.04 on $1.43B in revenue. Consensus for Q3/FY11 is $1.11/$4.40 on $1.49B/$5.78B in revenue. Guidance for FY11 capex has been $1.4B-$1.6B."

The consensus estimate is 65c for EPS and $2.25B for revenue, according to First Call. Brean Murray feels it is reasonable to believe that the company reports Q3 EPS of about 60c-70c, likely with slightly firmer pricing. Brean expects this to be a balanced quarter with a bit softer units, if Western Digital was indeed component constrained during the quarter. Guidance was for 50c-60c. Brean believes FQ4 EPS is much trickier given potential for share to shift away from Western Digital due to the Hitachi acquisition and potential component constraints. Brean Murray continues to believe that Western Digital has the potential to generate $3.50-$4.00 in CY11 EPS, and $4.00-$5.00, including almost full benefit of Hitachi, in CY12. Based on Brean's current assumptions for both peer Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital, they believe industry earnings power could ultimately be setting up to move Seagate shares into the low-mid $20's, and Western Digital towards the mid-high $40's -- through the year. Brean also believes Seagate is a likely share gainer in FQ4; Seagate commented that it isn't component constrained at the moment, nor does it expect to be -- but that it believes the rest of the industry appears to be. Investors will learn more tonight when Western Digital reports and comments on its component situation, but if Western Digital confirms it is constrained Brean Murray believes Seagate could react favorably on Thursday morning.

And I am not talking about the  accounting profits, but the economic profits,  which grew 1000% last year while accounting profits grew only 213%. You  can ignore the ""bear signals"" from stock technicians and fears over a  glut in the tablet business when it comes SNDK.The company’s financial achievements in 2010 are testament to the  scalability of SanDisk’s operations.   As a 35% increase in revenues  generated a 1000% increase in profits, SanDisk’s financial performance  in 2010 gives investors a peek into what I believe to be a very  profitable future for this company. Here are some of the most important  financial stats for investors:Now, one good year of profit does not necessarily make a good stock.  As regular readers know, in order to be on our ""most attractive"" stocks  list, a company has to be cheap as well as profitable. And SNDK does not  disappoint. The current valuation of the stock implies the company’s  profits will permanently decline by 35%. In other words, not only is the  market not giving SNDK any credit for growth, it is docking the stock  with a 35% decline in profits with no potential for growth from that  depressed level. This analysis is based on assessing the future cash  flow expectations embedded in SNDK’s current stock price, $46.60 as of  close on 4/4/11, using our dynamic discounted cash flow model.The risk/reward of this stock is quite compelling. Downside risk is  low as the valuation already implies a permanent 35% decline in profits.  How much worse can the valuation get? Upside reward potential is strong  as the stock has to go over $72/share to trade at value that implies  the company’s profits will experience a 0% decline, still a no-growth  scenario.The bear argument on SNDK is that the company’s margins will erode as  current and new competitors offer cheaper versions of the same products  that SNDK provides. My answer to that concern is (1) the scalability of  SNDK’s business model enables SNDK to lower prices while sacrificing  minimal to no profit and (2) the market for flash memory cards will  continue to grow at a strong rate. SNDK would have to lose a lot of  pricing power and market share to experience a 35% decline in profits.To summarize, SNDK’s stock present an excellent buying opportunity at  current levels because it meaningfully underestimates the future cash  flow potential of the company.SNDK gets our ""very attractive"" stock rating because the business is  throwing off a lot of cash, showing strong growth in profits while its  valuation implies economic earnings will permanently decline by 35%.For details on what causes the dif­fer­ence between eco­nomic ver­sus account­ing prof­its during the last five fiscal years, see Appen­dix 3 on page 10 of our report on SNDK.

One look at IDC’s most recent storage standings highlights how the acquisition changes the game for Western Digital.Western Digital, primarily a consumer storage player, will now battle Dell to be a top 5 storage player.Indeed, Western Digital will offer everything from personal storage devices to solid-state enterprise drives. Once this acquisition closes, there will be only four major hard drive makers—Seagate, Western Digital, Toshiba and Samsung. Hitachi’s storage unit was planning to go public.Western Digital CEO John Coyne said on a conference call:Western Digital operating chief Tim Leyden said:Under the terms of the deal, Western Digital is paying $3.5 billion in cash with the remainder paid for via 25 million Western Digital shares. Hitachi will own 10 percent of Western Digital when the deal is done. The companies said they expect the merger to close in the third quarter.For Western Digital, the transaction will add to non-GAAP earnings immediately. Coyne, CEO of Western Digital, will remain in charge and with Leyden and CFO Wolfgang Nickl reporting to him. Steve Milligan, CEO of Hitachi GST, will report to Coyne.On the conference call with analysts, Western Digital said there would be operating expense cuts. Western Digital executives were also confident that they could carry out any restructuring efforts. That topic was a big question since Hitachi has struggled with restructuring before with its Japanese ownership.Bottom line: The acquisition of Hitachi will allow Western Digital to better navigate the boom and bust cycle in the storage industry.Original post"
257314,23005,2011-03-09T12:45:30-05:00,,"I have covered technology as both an equity and industry analyst for a long time, and one thing that has remained constant is that the hard disk drive industry is both fiercely competitive and prone to poor returns. It is both capital- and R&D-intensive, as drive makers leverage scientific advancement to achieve higher and higher capacity drives.Worse still, the industry's customer base (i.e., PC makers) is not only highly concentrated, it refreshes products one and even two times a year. Moreover, PC makers benefit from this excess competition and strive to multi-source drives. As a result, the probability for an over-build of these highly fungible products is very high and inventory accretion is a frequent occurrence.  This has remained the case, even as the industry has relentlessly consolidated over the years.Now Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) has announced its intent to acquire the Disk Drive business of Hitachi Global Storage Technologies (HGST), which should at last bring more pricing discipline to this intensely competitive industry. The number of major participants will fall by one to four, should the deal close. (See the table below.)  It surely caps a pretty good year for WD, in which it outgrew Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) on a unit basis to claim a leading 31.0% share of the market, versus Seagate’s 29.7%.  With Hitachi’s 17.6% market share, WD will now have roughly half of the market. Moreover, Hitachi’s strong enterprise offering (for servers, etc.) will round-out WD’s strengths in the PC and Consumer markets. Investors certainly took heart, sending WDC shares up 17% to $35/share.  Seagate shares rose a more modest 9% with the realization that share shifts will result from the consolidation as PC makers re-jigger sourcing arrangements.The boards of both companies have approved the transaction and it is expected to close in the third quarter pending regulatory review and “customary conditions.”  WD management expects the acquisition to be immediately accretive to earnings, excluding acquisition-related expenses, restructuring charges and the amortization of intangibles.The prospect of lessened price competition could pose regulatory issues, though management believes the remaining market will continue to be sufficiently competitive.  HGST was itself formed in 2003 through the merger of the parent’s storage business with IBM Global Storage, which it acquired for $1.5 billion.  IBM’s storage business had long led the industry in technology, and Hitachi GST is a strong participant.The deal is indeed attractive. WD will acquire HGST for $4.3 billion, including $3.5 billion in cash and 25 million WDC shares valued prior to the announcement at ~$750 million.  Hitachi will retain a 10% interest in the combined company and secure two new positions on its board of directors.  The valuation seems reasonable, though its calculation is a bit laborious as we only know the December-quarter revenues for HGST ($1.543 billion). Given that the industry is notably seasonal, we note that the deal values HGST on a run-rate basis 0.70x the annualized revenue of $6.172 billion. This is comparable to WD’s valuation prior to the announcement of the deal (0.70x annualized revenues of $9.9 billion).  WD plans to finance the acquisition with existing cash and a debt issuance of $2.5 billion.The acquisition will be transformative for WD, increasing the revenue run rate by 62%. It will significantly augment the product line with Hitachi’s enterprise offering, in particular. Presently, in this more profitable market, HGST has a 28% and WD just 1% (versus Seagate’s 58% share).  This richer offering should thus improve profitability (on an adjusted basis) and yield the normal operating synergies.  The capital structure of the combined company will be notably more leveraged, relative to WD present capitalization (with little debt and $3.1 billion in cash).All in all, we view the transaction favorably. Maybe, at last, the hard disk drive market will display greater pricing discipline. More to the point, it caps for WD a succession of deals in recent years that have notably broadened its vertical capabilities (adding media and heads), adding to its TAM the most attractive enterprise segment of the market.  And with ~50% of the total market, the company will have a notably fortified position in the market.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Recall that competitor Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) guided to a December quarter TAM of 170M, above the 165M that Western Digital guided to back in mid-October. Citigroup's checks confirm that hard drive demand strengthened throughout the quarter, even causing spot shortages in certain high-capacity products. Citigroup expects the company to report revenue of $2.41B, which is down 8% yoy; gross margin of 17%; and EPS of 61c. While Citigroup sees little surprise on the Q2 results given the read-through from the Seagate pre-announcement, they believe strong March Q3 guidance, particularly on gross margin will be the catalyst that will get the Western Digital shares moving again. Citigroup's work suggests that Western Digital will guide to flat sequential change in TAM for Q3, which is meaningfully better than the historical mid-single digit decline. They attribute this to the ramp-up in Sandy Bridge-based notebooks in CQ1, a growing influence of Chinese New Years to Q1 seasonality, and firmer demand trends, coupled with a lack of excess channel inventory.

While this might be true to some extent, the tablets are also complementary to PCs and notebooks so the overall storage market grows, leaving plenty of room for hard disks still far into the future.Increased Capital SpendingAccording to iSuppli, the hard disk companies will spend a considerable amount of money in the near future on their manufacturing plants. Western Digital will spend $1.2 billion during the next five years on its plants in Malaysia. Likewise, increased capital expenditures have been announced by the likes of Toshiba, Samsung and Hitachi.Western Digital vs. SeagateData source: Finwiz.comSeagate has higher long term debt / equity – ratio and price per book than Western Digital, but, on the other hand, it has higher margins and lower P/E and P/S valuations. Looking at these values, both companies look like good picks.However, I started leaning towards Western Digital as I followed the Seagate buyout talks, in which Western Digital seemed to have an upper hand. Also, Western Digital products populate five positions in the Top 10 list of ""most sold hard drives"" iat my favourite local computer dealer, whereas Seagate has only two (WDC #2,3,6,7,8: STX #4,9). Because of this fact, and the fact that Western Digital is a volume and cost efficiency champ, I place my bets on WDC at this point of time.A Closer Look at Western DigitalWestern Digital has a very strong balance sheet. There is only a tiny amount of long term debt compared to cash and cash equivalents. Subtracting long term debt from cash leaves a net cash position of $2596 million or $11.30 per share.The valuations of the company also look very attractive when net cash is taken into account. Also, the growth rate has been phenomenal, so far. Even if it reduces to 10% p.a., the company looks cheap. Finwiz.com estimates price per free cash flow at 7.09. My own back-of-the-envelope guesstimate is that FCF for the ongoing fiscal year will be at least $800 million (or $3.48 a share). Taking into account the net cash position, I arrive to conclusion that the price of the business divided by free cash flow is 6.8. Not awfully cheap, but given the growth prospects, I think it’s a buy.Disclosure: I am long WDC."

However we  estimate that market share stabilized at 32% last year and could  increase slightly in the coming years.SanDisk competes with other companies that make memory chips or  storage devices like Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Samsung Electronics  (SEO), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and EMC (EMC).We estimate that mobile phone flash memory makes up 43% of our current price estimate of $50 for SanDisk’s stock, which is about 31% above the current market price of $38.Performance Helping DemandSanDisk’s memory cards have faster read and write speeds than many  competing products, particularly at larger storage capacities. For  instance, in one performance test of 16 GB SanDisk Mobile Ultra  microSDHC card vs. Kingston 8GB microSDHC card conducted by Legitreviews.com, SanDisk cards demonstrated ~25% faster read speed and ~50% faster write speed compared with competing products.Going forward, we expect SanDisk mobile phone flash memory market  share to increase slightly over the forecast period. As pointed out by  the management in its recent earnings call, the opportunity of an  expected 1.2 billion handsets being sold this year overshadows any other  consumer or computing market opportunity and SanDisk is well  positioned. [2]While our current forecasts call for stable growth, we note that if  its flash market share reaches past levels of near 42%, this adds just  under 10% to our price estimate.Above shows the average forecast among Trefis members for SanDisk  mobile phone flash memory market share, which is roughly in line with  our estimates.

231475,22145,2010-10-21T16:01:54-04:00,,"by Louis BaseneseI received several nasty-grams in response to my article  three months ago, in which I  railed against the prevailing sentiment  that the United States is headed for a  double-dip recession.I know, I know… shocking that a  guy like me would take such a contrarian position!Nevertheless, I stand by my  conviction. And especially since I’ve got some high-powered support…Warren Buffett’s Double-Dip Declaration At the recent Montana Economic  Development Summit, none other than Warren Buffett himself boldly declared: “We  will not have a double-dip recession at all. I see our businesses coming back  almost across the board.”It’s one thing to question me, a  lowly financial newsletter editor. But Mr. Buffett?The guy didn’t earn his track  record – or become the world’s  third-richest man – by being wrong. Plus, he  boasts intimate knowledge  of the inner workings of dozens of companies across  numerous sectors,  which makes him uniquely qualified to make such an  assessment.So here’s what I’m recommending  for you today:Act on Buffett’s conviction – and  mine. How?By investing in a cheap, cyclical  stock that Wall Street has punished unfairly, amid fears about a double-dip  recession…Western Digital Boots Up The Hard Drive…The company I’m referring to is Western  Digital (NYSE: WDC) – a  manufacturer of hard disk drives used in personal computers, consumer  electronics and enterprise applications.I profile the company on the  back of a sustained analyst crusade  against  its prospects (which merely  means it’s arguably the best time  to invest). For months, Wall Street’s “finest” have  ratcheted down the  company’s expectations, plus those of its competitors.Why? As one analyst put it, “Back-to-school  [sales] was sort of soft.”I’m not sure how you quantify “sort of,” but this  gentleman  obviously found a way. Analysts were simply buying into fears about a   double-dip recession… and as a result, were being overly pessimistic  about the  sector.And we got proof of their  miscalculation this week when Western Digital reported its quarterly earnings.  (Click here for Call Transcript)Translation: This is a  fundamentally solid stock, even during a downturn for the sector. And it’s a  cheap one, too…Disk Drives, Discounts and DominationWestern Digital currently trades  for less than seven times earnings.  That’s a 28% discount to its historical  price-to-earnings ratio. And  it’s a staggering 53% discount to the average  stock in the S&P 500.Now I’ll concede that sales for  the company’s main product – hard  disk drives – are notoriously cyclical. But  at current prices, I’m  convinced that all the possible bad news is already  priced into the  stock.And there’s more…Not only that, Western Digital  controls about 30% of the market.And if those fundamentals weren’t  compelling enough, how about this?Western Digital: A Grade-A Takeover Target I believe Western Digital is a  prime takeover target, too.Private equity firms are already  circling the wagons around Seagate Technology (Nasdaq: STX)  – Western Digital’s closet  competitor. And if they think Seagate is  cheap and attractive, there’s no doubt  that those sentiments extend to  Western Digital, too.I say that because Western Digital  is almost the exact same size as  Seagate in terms of market cap and market  share. But it’s in much  better financial shape.While Seagate has just enough cash  to pay off all its debt, Western Digital could pay off its debt and still  have $2.5 billion left in the bank (or almost $11 per share).That’s a small treasure, given  Western Digital’s market cap of just  $6.9 billion. And to potential suitors,  that cash represents an instant  rebate. Once they acquire the company, they get  to spend it as they  wish.Add it all up and as investors’  fears about a double-dip recession  subside – and PC sales accelerate – this  undervalued, cyclical play  should take off. That is, if the company isn’t  acquired first – and for a  hefty premium.Either way, I recommend that you  position your portfolio before it’s too late.Disclosure: Investment U expressly forbids its writers from having a  financial interest in any security they recommend to our subscribers.

231474,21445,2010-10-21T15:57:25-04:00,,"SanDisk (SNDK) is expected to report Q3 earnings after the market close on Thursday, October 21, with a conference call scheduled for 5:00 pm ET. The consensus estimate is $1.05 for EPS and $1.24B for revenue, according to First Call. Sales guidance for Q3 is $1.18B-$1.25B, down 0.3% to up 6%. Stifel is estimating revenue of $1.22B, slightly below the Street, based on its estimate that NAND Flash ASPs decline of 13% quarter-over-quarter, and bit growth of 19% quarter-over-quarter. Through September mainstream 32Gb NAND Flash pricing was down 15% quarter-over-quarter. Stifel estimates overall GM at 45.6%. For OpEx the firm is modeling a 13% increase quarter-over-quarter, in-line with guidance form last earnings call. The firm's non-GAAP EPS estimate of $1.01 is 4c below the Street. Looking forward: Stifel forecasts Q4 revenue of $1.37B, another 14% quarter-over-quarter decline in ASPs, offset by 32% bit growth quarter-over-quarter. The Street is expecting slightly lower quarter-over-quarter growth of 10% leading to revenue of $1.263B. The ASP assumptions follow Stifel's belief that NAND Flash pricing will follow seasonal patterns in Q4 which typically see a quarter-over-quarter decline in the low-mid teens. The firm is maintaining a product GM estimate of 41% and expect another $91M of royalty revenue to help boost overall GM to 44.9%. Stifel estimates another 8% quarter-over-quarter increase in OpEx to $210M for Q4. This leads to its non-GAAP EPS estimate of $1.12, in-line with the Street. On the company's last earnings call, SanDisk raised its 2010 capex forecast to $1.1B from $800M-$900M. Commentary on the call will likely focus on questions about SanDisk and the new Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) MacBook. Also, investor questions could focus on the renewed takeover speculation recently."
248748,20568,2011-01-26T11:14:35-05:00,,"SanDisk Corp. (SNDK)  is scheduled to announce its fourth quarter 2010 results on January 27,  2011, and we see no revisions in analyst estimates at this point.Third Quarter OverviewSanDisk delivered solid third quarter 2010 results, with adjusted  earnings per share (NYSEARCA:EPS) of $1.20 per share beating the Zacks Consensus  Estimate of $1.02.SanDisk’s third quarter revenues increased 32.0% from the year-ago  period led by strength in both OEM and retail businesses. The quarter’s  revenue was in line with the company’s guided range of $1.175–$1.25  billion. Product revenues were up by 39.8% year over year, but License  & Royalty revenues fell 20.8%.Consolidated gross margin of the company was 52.2%, up from 47.2%  reported in the year-ago quarter attributable to higher Product gross  margin. Moreover, higher 32-nanometer yields and rapid transition to  32-nanometer X3 lowered costs. Operating margin surged 890 basis points  year over year. Including the amortization of acquisition-related  intangible assets, convertible debt interest expense, and related tax  adjustments, non-GAAP net income for the quarter came in at $289.91  million or $1.20 per share versus $156.14 million or $0.67 per diluted  share reported in the year-ago period.Cash and short-term investments totaled approximately $5.1 billion and  cash flow from operations was $379.1 million. Long-term marketable  securities during the third quarter stood at $2.14 billion.Guidance For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, SanDisk expects revenues of  $1.25 billion to $1.32 billion. Management expects License & Royalty  revenue between $85.0 million and $90.0 million. For fiscal 2010,  SanDisk expects revenues in the range of $4.75–$4.825 billion.Agreement of AnalystsOut of the six and seven analysts providing estimates for the fourth  quarter and fiscal 2010, respectively, none made any revision to  estimates in the past thirty days. However, two out of eight analysts  raised their estimates for fiscal 2011.The limited number of changes to estimates also point to the fact that  there was no major catalyst during the quarter that could drive results.  Consequently, the analysts are sticking to the estimates projected  following third quarter earnings.Most analysts are bullish on the growth trends witnessed in the NAND  flash memory market. However, concerns involving a cyclical downturn  ,led by oversupply in the market, are mounting. Hence analysts are  taking a conservative view before getting a clear picture on the NAND  demand in the coming quarters.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThere were no changes to analyst estimates for the fourth quarter or  fiscal 2010 over the past 30 days. However, we noticed an improvement of  3 cents each in the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth quarter and  fiscal 2010, respectively, since the third quarter earnings  announcement. Additionally, estimates for fiscal 2011 increased 4 cents  over the past ninety days. The reason for the upward movement could be  the stable pricing environment.RecommendationThe analysts believe that SanDisk will be able to deliver strong  financials in the December quarter and fiscal 2010 based on strong NAND  demand, fuelled by the demand for mobile phones. We believe that the  demand for flash memory will continue as it provides the most viable  data storage on smartphones, tablets and other portable devices.  Moreover, SanDisk’s solid state drive design wins into Intel Corp.’s (NASDAQ:INTC) Sandy Bridge PC platforms are also encouraging.Currently, SanDisk has a Zacks Rank of #2 implying a short-term Buy recommendation."
240305,22755,2010-12-06T14:47:13-05:00,,"Prognosticating the future using crystal balls, tea leaves or  entrails is only a little less risky than forecasting paradigm shifts in  technology. I believe we are at the cusp of change in regard to where  we store our ever growing cache of files. As I see it, there are two  competing technologies emerging. On the one hand, there is the almost  limitless capacity of the cloud; on the other hand, flash memory. The  advantage of the cloud is the previously unlimited capacity. The  downside of the cloud includes issues of security and privacy. Flash  memory offers greater security but, as of today, greater cost. Both of  these technologies will expand in the future. For the foreseeable  future, the old fashioned hard disk drive will remain the dominant form  of mass storage.Any discussion of flash memory and the emerging technology of solid state drives must include SanDisk Corporation (SNDK).  SanDisk describes itself as “the world’s largest supplier of flash data  storage card products, designs, manufactures and markets  industry-standard, solid-state data (SSD), digital imaging and audio storage  products using its patented, high-density flash memory and controller  technology.”The Company’s products are ubiquitous in such consumer products as  digital cameras, digital camcorders, GPS devices, MP3 players, gaming  consoles, USB flash drives and the new, dedicated e-books. Sandisk  products also are prominent is the fast growing smartphone market. The  new market for flash memory resides in the various computer form  factors. The here today, gone tomorrow netbooks, notebooks and tablet  computers.At the present time, the mobile and imaging markets are the largest  growth drivers for SanDisk. These segments, combined, account for 70% of  the company’s growth. Looking to the future, will SSD be a mega-trend?  It is still too early to tell. The technology needs to develop further  and costs must decrease substantially for SSD to really take off. If  tablets become this decade’s major product innovation, then SSD price/GB  will decline as storage capacity builds. Let us not forget that SanDisk  partners with both Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)  and Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) by supplying the memory for the iPad and Galaxy tablets.  SanDisk also supplies the memory for the iPhone and other smartphones.Is SanDisk in a financial position to exploit these developments?We will start with the balance sheet. The Company ended 3Q10 with  $2,903.8 million in cash and short-term investments and $1,687.8 million  in long-term debt. Long-term debt to equity is 32.5%. Long-term debt to  capital is 24.6%. Interest coverage is 83.6X. The current ratio is 4.4X  and the quick ratio is 3.8X. Total liabilities/free cash flow is about  2X. SanDisk is not overleveraged and can easily meet its short-term cash  requirements. The Company has grown equity by 14.5% over the past seven  years. ROE is 25.9% and ROA is 17.1%.For the twelve month period ending October 2010, SanDisk reported  sales of $4,741.0 million and EPS diluted of $4.85. Earlier this year,  the Company provided some guidance on sales. It projects FY11 sales in  the range of $4.75billion to $4.825 billion. Thomson Reuters reports  analyst revenue estimates for FYE 12/10 to range from $4,693 million to  $4,797 million and for FYE 12/11, $4,308.8 million to $5,866 million.  Earnings estimates for FYE 12/10 range from $4.31 to $4.56; for FYE  12/11, $2.45 to 4.88.Year-over-Year, sales have grown nearly 49% and EPS diluted about  164.9%. Long term, the Company’s sales and EPS have been erratic, as has  free cash flow. Profit margins have been all over the place, with 2008  being a disaster.SanDisk is a healthy company that is well positioned to benefit from the  smartphone and tablet wars.  It offers leading-edge technology strong  partnerships with industry leaders. At a recent price of $48.31, SanDisk  has a PE of 10X, a PB of 2.1X and PS of 2.3X. With an estimated future  growth rate of 14.33%, the PEG Estimated EPS is 0.8X. By these measures,  SanDisk appears to be a growth stock masquerading as a value stock.Disclosure: Author has a long position in SanDisk and no position in Apple or Samsung."
221124,20210,2010-08-18T08:50:14-04:00,,"For the first time since SanDisk Corporation (Nasdaq:SNDK)  founder and CEO Dr. Eli Harari dropped the bombshell of his planned  year-end resignation, he will speak at the Flash Memory Summit in  California.Harari will speak about ""Why flash in the next decade  will be even bigger than you think."" But he will not speak about why  specifically at the eve of this decade he has decided that it is the  right time to hand the reins over to his partner in founding the  company more than twenty years ago, Sanjay Mehrotra.Two weeks  ago, in an interview with ""Globes"", Harari reiterated that at his age,  65, it was the right time to resign. He also pointed out that he was  healthy and wanted to do more with his family.Harari's  explanations seemed very logical, to quit at the top. But I was not  entirely convinced that an entrepreneur like him, just when he reaches  the top of the world, and on the eve of the decade which will be ""bigger  than you think"", decides to quit at an age which for a long time has  not been considered retirement age.Harari's steps throughout his  career, which have brought him to his current peak, have been the type  that seemed surprising in the short term, and only after a long time  turned out to be brilliant.For example, when he set up SanDisk,  he naturally turned to Eastman Kodak (EK), which was a gorilla at the  time, and offered it to invest in SanDisk, because ""a day will come when  flash will replace film"". They agreed, but wanted exclusivity, and  while Harari was then desperate for money, he turned down the giant, an  illogical move which turned out to be ingenious only after many years.  Today, as is known, Kodak is worth only about a tenth of SanDisk on the  stock exchange.Another brave move by Harari, exactly a decade  ago, was to link up with Japan's Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF). He signed with it on a  partnership in which each side would bring its unique patents in the  NAND area, and together they would set up facilities based on Toshiba's  knowledge in mass production.Those were the days when America  had not yet gotten over the trauma of the 80s and 90s, when Japanese  firms were seen as those who ""steal"" information, especially in  production of cars and chips. Looking back, the move to join together is  considered brilliant.The third move that turned out to be  brilliant was to turn down Samsung's (SSLNF.PK) buyout offer two years ago. Harari  explained in the recent interview that US institutional investors - of  the largest that there are - exerted tremendous pressure on his  board to accept the offer, but Harari was not convinced and he won over  the board. Today the share price is nearly double, and the future is as  rosy as ever.In my opinion, it may take another year until we  understand why Harari decided suddenly, at the peak of his career, in  the summer of 2010, to be a good grandfather to his grandchildren.SanDisk's  business environment in the next year and a half is a flash market that  leans toward a shortage. No one knows how sharp it will be, because it  depends on the strength of demand. The new facilities being built today  by flash producers will only become operational in 2011.In the  conversation, Harari said that he prefers a situation of shortage, even  if SanDisk is forced to buy chips from competitors based on existing  agreements, than one of oversupply, like two years ago, which destroyed  the market, nearly threatening its existence.Harari also said  that in his opinion, SanDisk has at least several quarters' advantage  over its competitors with its X3 technology (3 bytes per memory cell)-  ""It's like getting additional production capability at no charge."" At  the conference this week other SanDisk executives will also be present,  and I assume that new developments will be announced about the market  that is set to be among the largest in the next decade - the SSD  market, storing details on flash based solutions instead of on hard  drives.That is also a market which Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) announced a  while ago that it sees as strategic. We will also hear from Intel at the  conference, but there is still heavy fog surrounding its continued  involvement in producing the NAND chips on which the SSD solutions are  built.From the conversation with Harari, I understood that it is a  definite possibility that Intel has decided to get out of producing  NAND, and to find other supply options for its SSD solutions.Harari  repeated at the interview his advice to Intel - ""If you want to know  the time, you don’t need to buy the watch"". This is advice that he has  given Intel more than once before, when he was referring to the fact  that SanDisk-Toshiba can supply it with NAND. If Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU),  Intel's partner in what was a NAND producing venture, continues to  produce NAND alone, it will need to sign a licensing agreement with  SanDisk and pay it royalties.When I asked if and when this would happen, I got from Harari his only ""no comment"" in that interview.Disclosure: Author holds shares as part of  his    portfolio tracked by ""Globes"".Published by Globes  [online],   Israel business news - www.globes-online.com   - on November 17, 2009;   Reprinted on Seeking Alpha with permission ©   Copyright of   Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd. 2009"
226482,22130,2010-09-22T05:37:26-04:00,,"Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) has been getting a lot of attention from value investors, as well as a steady drumbeat of downgrades and target reductions from the analyst community. Concerns about the future of the hard disk industry, together with excess capacity and a potential price war, have been outweighing a TTM P/E of 4.2, a forward P/E of 7.41, and a strong balance sheet.However, that could change, because WDC has a definite history of seasonality in its share prices, strong enough to warrant holding through January next year while waiting for prices to recover.Here are two charts showing the seasonality pattern (click to enlarge images):Based on 36 years worth of data, the first chart displays the pattern of relative seasonality against the S&P 500 index. The second displays absolute seasonality for the stock itself. The lower section of the first chart shows month by month whether WDC outperformed the S&P; that section on the second chart shows the percentage of the time that the month involved was profitable.Holding a full size position with a substantial unrealized loss, I have been asking myself how much longer I should continue to exercise patience. After studying the information shown, it appears that November, December and January have historically been good months to be holding this stock.Industry revenues also demonstrate a definite seasonal trend.Western Digital and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) both end their fiscal years on 6/30. Their 1st fiscal quarter, ending 9/30, features back to school sales together with a first look at inventory build for Christmas. The 2nd quarter, ending 12/31, includes the holiday season, and normally shows the highest revenue and margins. Over the past seven years WDC's 2nd quarter accounted for 26.2% of sales and 29.7% of earnings, disregarding one time charges. Guidance at that point may include insight into corporate IT investment trends. Taken together, these two two quarters can make or break the year. First quarter EPS and guidance will be telling, particularly in view of the inventory overhang for the 4th quarter.I reviewed the industry capacity and excess inventory situation in early August, concluding at the time that it was manageable. Western Digital, Seagate, and Hitachi (HIT) all expect that the digital storage market will continue to expand, based on statements in their financial reports and/or press releases. The proliferation of digital content is a primary driver. While concerns for excess capacity and competition are understandable, I suspect they are overdone given the published opinion of the larger players.Hitachi is the third important player in the industry, which has been consolidating. After years of substandard results on its disk operations, Hitachi has worked hard to improve their disk-making operations. From the 20-F:The newfound competition has generated a lot of concerns within the industry and among analysts. Noting the recent surge in the Japanese yen, it is possible that Hitachi may not be as feisty and competitive as they have been recently.Taking all of this together, I am looking for WDC share prices to improve on into January next year. At that point, the situation can be reviewed and a longer term decision made whether to continue to hold or to exit the position and look for better opportunities elsewhere.Disclosure: Author is long WDC, no position in other stocks mentioned"

The analysts have raised SNDK to a buy from neutral and have raised their price target to $55 from $46. As the largest maker of flash memory products, SanDisk stands to benefit greatly from the proliferation of smart phones, MP3 music players, tablet computers and other handheld devices that use such memory. The UBS analysts are confident that concerns regarding oversupply of flash memory have been overblown because of the strong demand for handheld devices now and into the future.For a stock that has performed as well as SanDisk has, up 58% thus far year to date, one has to wonder if the stock has already played out. In this regard, we have to agree with the analysts at UBS in that the company continues to have substantial upside despite the recent outperformance of the stock. According to our methodology, the stock is Undervalued and we only recently upgraded it from Fairly Valued in June. For example, the stock currently sells for only 11.9x this year’s EPS estimate, which compares very favorably to their historically normal range of 17.8x to 41.3x over the course of its last ten years.On a price-to-sales basis, SanDisk is less attractive, yet its valuation is still not particularly distressing. Historically speaking, the market has been willing to pay between 1.22x and 3.54x times sales per share. SanDisk is currently near the middle of that range at just about 2.1x. Still, we see more upside potential for SanDisk as they are expected to grow sales further by about 10.5% in fiscal 2011.Of course, we are concerned that margin compression in the memory products market may be unavoidable, but we tend to agree with the UBS analysts that oversupply concerns may already be priced in. When you look at the huge popularity of consumer electronics devices that utilize these memory chips, we think continued growth is completely reasonable to expect. Smart phones have spread rapidly in the past few years, just like MP3 players like iPods did before smart phones. We think that eReaders and tablet computers could drive the next phase of growth in for memory chip makers. All indications point to SanDisk being one of the leaders in providing that memory going forward.Original post"

The performance of the new memory products along with reliability and storage capacity make the devices ideal for many application according to reports.Garner today improved their chip sales forecast for the year from an increase of 19% roughly to better than 27%. The economy was a main reason for the upgrade to predictions but also semiconductor revenue growth over the past 5 quarters has been stronger than they thought it would be.SanDisk itself has seen its expected earnings for the quarter improve from 55 cents a share to 86 cents a share this week. Revenue is expected to increase 56% compared to the same quarter last year while the earnings corresponds to a 139% improvement. Next quarter also looks promising with revenue growth (year over year) expected to be 31% better and earnings (year over year) thought to grow near 19%.The PEG ratio is still low at .72 with price to earnings (P/E) at 12.57 when the markets closed today. I feel SanDisk is in a good position to be purchased if you believe the markets have begun their break-out upward. There is no clear hold signal as the indexes are still negative but SanDisk is signaling a buy and is only hovering near it’s 52 week high reached prior to the recent market declines.Disclosure: None"

The stock has a gap it is working to fill and is part of the ""teflon"" crew at this moment. But, as a hostage to ""student body left"" trading, it's working on its 6th straight down day. I'd like to see these ""teflon"" stocks take more of a beating before feeling the market can bounce in a more substantial way; they were so overbought that even these selloffs have only taken most down to their 20-day.

It hasn't breached the 50-day other than a few of the gut wrenching drops in the greater market in early May.I am thinking of placing an order to rebuy nearer to the 50 day moving average of $43.15 and then if the stock breaks down below the 50-day that will probably coincide with a S&P 500 breaking down below 1040 and we'll need to cut back again.

Major  competitors include Hynix, Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Samsung  (OTC:SSNLF), STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM), Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) and IM  Flash (a joint venture of Micron and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)).SanDisk is currently experiencing torrid demand from manufacturers of  smartphones, tablets, e-book readers and other mobile Internet devices.  The company reported revenue of $1.18 billion for the second quarter of  2010, up 61% year-on-year. SanDisk also maintained excellent gross  margins thanks to strong memory pricing and successful cost-cutting  efforts.In response to this news we have increased our stock price estimate  for SanDisk from $43.70 to $50.2.  Our analysis follows below.   OEM Business to Drive Growth for SanDiskSandisk sells memory cards to a number of original equipment  manufacturers (OEMs). The OEM business grew 181% from the year-ago  quarter ,with unit volume more than doubling during the same period. The  OEM business is expected to remain strong for the rest of the year,  driven by new product cycles from manufacturers of smartphones, tablets,  e-book readers and other mobile Internet devices that use flash-based  storage solutions.SanDisk expects strong demand for memory cards from manufacturers of  tablet devices that compete with Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad. The company also  announced a joint venture with Toshiba to manufacture flash memory at  Fab 5, a new facility at Toshiba’s memory production facility in Mie  Prefecture, Japan.We estimate that memory cards for mobile phones constitute  approximately 43% of SanDisk’s share value. Sandisk sells mobile memory  cards to both OEMs and retail customers. Retail demand has been  particularly strong in Asian markets and seems likely to remain brisk  for the rest of 2010.We expect SanDisk’s share of the global mobile phone flash memory  market to reach 32.5%  by the end of the Trefis forecast period. You can drag the  trend-line in the chart below to create your own mobile memory market  share estimate and see its impact on SanDisk’s stock price.High Gross MarginsSanDisk reported strong margins for the second quarter, driven by  favorable pricing and internal cost-cutting efforts. Consolidated  product gross margins stood at 41.8% for the six months ending in July  2010, up 20.7% year-on-year. SanDisk expects demand to exceed supply for  the second half of this year. Accordingly, we forecast gross margins of  39.1% for for 2010.The chart below shows how SanDisk’s gross margins impact its stock  price.

199996,21445,2010-04-21T14:26:16-04:00,,"SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) is expected to report Q1 earnings after the market close on Wednesday, April 21, with a conference call scheduled for 5 pm ET. The consensus estimate is 59c for EPS and $985.85M for revenue, according to First Call. SanDisk positively pre-announced its Q1 results at its analyst day on March 1, on the back of order strength from OEMs and better NAND Flash pricing. Guidance for Q1 was for revenue of $925M-$1B. Its outlook prior to the analyst day was for sales between $875M-$950M. SanDisk raised Q1 total margin guidance to 40%, plus or minus two points. Thomas Weisel had been modeling a 10% ASPs decline quarter-over-quarter which now seems could be only a 5% ASP decline, the firm says. This would imply a 5% top-line beat and with an improving gross margin roughly a 5c beat on the bottom line. For the June quarter, Weisel currently estimates top line growth of 5.3% q/q to $1.014B. The firm believes this may prove conservative even from the higher Q1 revenue base. The better than expected Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPad launch and the expectations for competitive products may extend the tight supply/demand ratio throughout the year. Weisel believes the gross margin will continue to see support from stable NAND Flash pricing as well as Samsung royalty revenue. Weisel's Q2 estimates are 53c on $1.014B in revenue. Consensus is 28c on $1.04B. For 2010, SanDisk gave a revenue forecast of $4B-$4.4B at it's analyst day. With the shares up 23% or so, since the analyst day vs. the SOX up 16%, Weisel believes this good news is built into the shares."

A CFA and Certified Fund Specialist with a Series 7 license, Jeffrey oversees the firm’s macro analysis and specializes in U.S. economic and bond market data.His colleague, Portfolio Manager James Worden, oversees U.S. equities and the firm's quantitative screening models.Seeking Alpha recently got the chance to ask Jeffrey and James about the highest conviction stock holding they see right now. For starters, would you tell us a bit about your fund's investment approach?Our investment philosophy revolves around the client achieving their financial goals - by developing a prudent investment portfolio utilizing strategic asset allocation with a tactical overlay. Our core strategic approach focuses on the long-term investment goal while the short-term tactical element capitalizes on market opportunity. Growth, protection and preservation of assets are the ultimate goals at Iron Point Capital Management.What is your highest conviction stock pick currently? Our model right now is scoring Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC) very well compared with other equities in our database. We first bought this stock back in mid-May of last year, and though we’re up roughly 90% in the position since then, we still rate the stock highly.Western Digital's primary business is in the design, manufacturing and sales of hard disk drives. The company sells its products worldwide for use in computer systems and consumer electronics. Doing a deep dive on the data points scored in the model reveals that valuations from both a relative and an intrinsic standpoint are very attractive, and revenue and earnings growth also look very appealing. One data point in our model put the fair value at just under $79.57. (The stock closed Thursday at $40.34.) That’s an additional upside of roughly 97% to get to fair value. Of course, this assumes that it meets or beats our estimates for profit growth for the next few years. It’s inexpensive from a Forward P/E multiple as well. At just 6.9 times the next four quarters' earnings, it has some room to grow, ranking in the top 1% against the sector and top 4% for the industry. Even if it traded at its 10-year average of 10.8, that’s still upside of roughly 60%. Earnings quality and strong cash flow also are a positive for this stock. Can you talk a bit about the sector? How much is Western Digital an ""industry pick"" as opposed to a pure bottom-up pick? WDC is a pure bottom-up equity pick. That said, we do find the technology sector attractive moving forward, as many of the same fundamental improvements that we are seeing in the technology space will also help WDC increase its revenue and profit growth.From a macro standpoint, we believe that demand for storage has rebounded and will remain high for both businesses and consumers, as consumers continue to flock to the electronics space in spite of the challenging economic climate, and businesses are starting to further increase their capital spending budgets. A boost from depleted inventory levels should also provide further catalyst for sales to increase.The advent of higher-pixel digital cameras, higher-resolution video formats, high-definition DVRs, and the need to store large photo, movie, and music libraries is growing and we believe it will continue to grow for some time.  Western Digital has been further aided by a more stable pricing environment and good expense control. What are your thoughts on Western Digital's competition? While Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) has had a higher momentum score than WDC and while the street appears to be favoring STX over WDC right now, we feel better about WDC from a profit growth standpoint and we feel that STX is richer from a cash flow return on total capital measure. From several other measures, however, STX also looks very attractive.While we admit that the competition for market share may continue to be a challenge, we are impressed with the innovation at Western Digital and we believe that it will outshine the competition due to its strong portfolio of products. More important, we think that there is enough growth for multiple firms to benefit.  What about analyst sentiment on Western Digital? Sell-side analysts have been generally revising their estimates upward, though there is some dispersion in the estimate numbers. We believe that those analysts who have been more accurate over time, the same analysts who have higher estimates right now, are probably on the right track about the direction of earnings growth. Our thoughts are that the analysts with lower estimates will eventually cluster-revise upwards, similar to what we saw last January. We think that this gives more potential for upgrades to WDC - if everyone was currently a bull on WDC, then we probably wouldn’t have as high of a conviction on the stock.  What will cause you to trim or sell out of a position like this? From a risk management standpoint, we have slightly trimmed the position even though the quant score is very attractive, as we prefer to have not any one position get too large relative to the other holdings. We needed to do this with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as well. In Apple's case, it was purely a valuation concern. We continue to rely on the scores in terms of whether we should trim it significantly or sell it altogether.In this market environment, our approach has typically been to trim based on a lack of conviction in areas such as growth, valuation, or momentum and to eliminate positions that have one or more red flags from a risk or financial health standpoint, or two or more red flags in any of the other areas. We still hold AAPL, because the only red flag is valuation. All other scores are high and this keeps the composite score still looking good.  What are the downside risks for Western Digital? We believe the biggest risk is that the industry starts slowing down as a result of a poor supply/demand dynamic and that earnings growth doesn’t materialize as anticipated by analysts. This will make the valuation less appealing and put a degree of uncertainty in the stock price - which is usually in the form of a discount and not a premium.  What type of model do you generally run, and are you primarily investing in growth or value stocks? We are not like many traditional bottom-up fundamental stock pickers. We employ a proprietary quantitative scoring model (QESM) that screens through and scores 4,000 companies from both a growth and value standpoint. All in all, we’re sifting through over a million data points. We then apply more of a qualitative fundamental analysis overlay for companies that make the top 50-100 names.We are different in that we are just not focusing on valuations or fundamentals, or just looking for growth or value stories. We are also not biased toward a particular market cap. We have bought names like LZ, NVO, DLM, and ENDP, as well as RTN, JNJ, PTV, and DLTR. Our multifactor model also looks at various risk and volatility measures in addition to growth metrics, financial health metrics, and momentum or technical factors. This strategy has helped us quite a bit with a large client that had transferred over a number of higher risk names, like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, AIG, MER, C, and GS.While some indicators looked good or average, other data points were popping up red flags. Our composite score for these names was low well before trouble started really brewing and, fortunately, we were able to get out of them before things got real bad. We only held on to GS. We’ll be the first to admit that the picks generated from this model may not always outperform in a raging bull market, particularly when low quality companies, highly leveraged firms, or those with relatively poor financial health are the top performers.

Flash memory cards are SanDisk’s core business and the significance of mobile phone market makes memory for mobile phones an important driver of SanDisk’s stock.Below we discuss the importance of phone memory to SanDisk stock, benefits of higher memory for SanDisk, and how popularity of higher capacity cards among smartphone users can create a 7% upside to to SanDisk’s stock.Mobile Phones Flash Cards is 33% of SanDisk’s StockMobile phone flash memory is the most business for SanDisk, constituting 33% of the $30 Trefis price estimate for SanDisk’s stock.32 GB is the Next Generation Flash Card for SmartphonesWe estimate that the global mobile phone shipments will reach 1.3 billion units in 2010 with smartphones owning 19% share. With growing demand for smartphones, we expect smartphone penetration will reach 43% of the total 1.83 billion mobiles shipped by the end of Trefis forecast period.The new 32 GB memory from SanDisk is attractive to smartphone users because it provides freedom to store greater volumes of video, music, games, digital images, applications and business documents. We believe the current high price of $200 for the 32 GB memory card will limit the card usage to high-end smartphones only but that prices will come down over time.Higher GB memory benefits SanDisk in two ways:1. Retain Market Share in Mobile Phone Flash MemorySanDisk is the market leader in mobile phone flash memory with 44% share globally in 2009. The new high memory card will help it continue with its dominance against other flash memory makers such as Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF), Transcend (TRCR), Kingston, Memorex, Fuji and Lexar (LEXR).2. Slows Decline in Average Sale Price of SanDisk Memory Cards With greater demand for higher storage memory cards from smartphone users, the average capacity per flash card shipped will increase, and this will slow the decline the average price of a SanDisk memory card.7 % Upside to SanDisk’s Stock from Higher Capacity CardsIf the average capacity per SanDisk’s flash memory card increases to 18 GB from our previous estimate of 8.4 GB for 2010, this can create an upside of 7% to SanDisk’s stock.You can modify the forecast above to see how SanDisk’s stock would be impacted if the capacity per flash card increased more than we forecast.For additional analysis and forecasts, here is our complete model for SanDisk’s stock.Disclosure: No positions"

However, the market has vindicated us the recent price of $39.43 is awfully close to our target.Looking ahead, we have a twelve month target price of $52.81. Western Digital Corporation [WD] designs, develops, manufactures and sells hard drives. The Company sells its products worldwide to original equipment manufacturers [OEMs] and original design manufacturers [ODMs] for use in computer systems, subsystems or consumer electronics [CE] devices, and to distributors, resellers and retailers. Its hard drives are used in desktop computers, notebook computers, and enterprise applications, such as servers, workstations, network attached storage, storage area networks and video surveillance equipment.Additionally, its hard drives are used in CE applications, such as digital video recorders [DVRs], and satellite and cable set-top boxes [STBs]. WD also sells its hard drives as stand-alone storage products and integrates them into finished enclosures, embedding application software and offering the products as WD-branded external storage appliances. On March 27, 2009, it completed the acquisition of SiliconSystems, Inc.By The Numbers Quarterly sales for the last four reported quarters show consistent improvement. For the quarter ending 03/09, sales stood at $1,590.0 million and compared to $2,111.0 million in 03/08. In each of the subsequent quarters, sales increased so that by 10/09, sales were ahead of the prior year quarter. For the twelve month period ending 01/10, sales stood at $8,348.0 million as compared to the equivalent prior twelve month period of $8,036.0 million, a 3.9% gain.The decline in the sales growth rate can be attributed to a lack of pricing power in today’s environment. Historically, sales grew at a rate of more than 19%. The company continues to add new products and there is increasing momentum in quarter over quarter sales growth. Reuters reports consensus estimates for FYE 06/10 at $9,814.38.Over the past four quarters, earning reflected the decline in sales and the same pattern of picking up when sales turned around. In the quarter ending 03/09, EPS came in at $0.22 compared with $1.23 in 03/08. Earnings picked up in each subsequent quarter so that in 10/09, EPS was reported at $1.25 as compared to $0.93. In 01/10, quarterly EPS was $1.85 as compared with $0.06 in 01/09. EPS for the twelve month period ending 01/10 totaled $4.18. In comparison, in the one year ago period, EPS totaled $3.16.

Again, net margins reflect the same trend spiking to 11.5% in the twelve month period ending 01/10 from FY 09’s margin of 6.3%. Historically, WDC reports a net margin in the 9.0% - 10.0% range.The company historically underperforms its industry median when measured by gross margins. However, when it comes to operating margins and net margins, WDC significantly out-performs. This reflects well on management’s ability to control costs. Return on Equity at 28.1% and Return on Assets at 17.0% are higher than industry medians. In fact, with the exception of FY 09, ROE is typically near 40.0%. In every year, WDC reports ROE and ROA that beats the industry median.The company has a strong balance sheet. The Current Ratio is 2.2X and Total Liabilities to Total Assets is a moderate 39.4%. Long term debt stands at $350.0 million. Long Term Debt to Capital is 8.1%. Cash and short-term investments total $2,435.0 million or 27% of the recent market price.ConclusionWe see continued growth for Western Digital and believe it is currently undervalued.

In this age of smartphones, where technical enhancements are taking place at regular intervals, advanced storage capacity will enhance the mobile offices, music players, movie storage, video recording and other features of the mobile device. SanDisk is continuously introducing innovative new products to retain its market leading position.  The company posted very encouraging fourth quarter 2009 results, exceeding the management guidance. SanDisk witnessed major gains in the OEM business and higher product revenue and has provided a decent guidance for the first quarter. The company has reduced its cost of production significantly, which in turn improved the gross margin substantially in 2009.  The Zacks Consensus Estimate also tells a positive tale. The estimate for the upcoming March 2010 quarter is $0.49, which is a year-over-year growth of 189.1%, while for fiscal year 2010 the estimate is $2.41, representing a growth rate of 49.7% over 2009 levels. Seven of the analysts covering the stock have made upward revisions to their March quarter estimate, while 8 have revised their estimate upward for fiscal year 2010, with no downward revision.

Weisel believes Street expectations is for a guidance of $80M-$90M, with numbers above this range being positive for the shares. Also, Weisel is looking for the continued transition to 3bits+ to be on track, and they believe these chips are getting acceptance in higher end consumer products, which could be a positive indicator for longer term gross margins.

185895,22486,2010-02-02T01:53:26-05:00,,"So the market is in correction mode and the volatility has increased…what’s a trader to do? Well, one thing one probably shouldn’t do is buy overpriced put protection. The reason is that even if the market goes down, a decrease in the put’s implied volatility can erase any price gains. Instead of buying high volatility, the smart trader instead sells it, and here’s one way to accomplish that.The covered put, put simply During market rallies, covered calls offer a fairly conservative way of generating monthly income; during market corrections, the covered put offers a similar situational risk/reward profile. Basically, a covered put involves shorting stock and writing put contracts against the short position. If the underlying stock falls below the strike price, the stock will be “put” to you which you can use to close out your short position.Caveats Keep in mind margin requirements for this position and understand that although the credit you receive from selling the put can offset a small loss if your stock starts to rise, it won’t protect you against major losses if the stock rallies violently. Like the covered call, also be aware that the profit made from this strategy is capped by the strike price of the sold put, i.e., the further out of the money the strike, the greater your potential for profit, but at the expense of position risk as we’ll soon see.Stock selection Okay. The market is beginning a corrective phase (which you can tell by the fact that good news is met by price declines). Fear and uncertainty are reflected by an increase in market volatility. You think that now might be a good time to reap some of that volatility by selling covered puts, but what stocks should you choose?You want to find those issues that have a good reason to continue losing steam. They can be found among the following criteria:1.Companies that miss earnings estimates, and more importantly, those that have lowered future guidance. 2.Those that are being downgraded by analysts. {Analysts typically do this as a reactionary move after a negative event has already occurred, but if the downgrade comes during a period of no news and is based on something different, such as a revised earnings estimate, then I’d give more creedence to it.) 3.Companies issuing bad news such as: a new product that isn’t as well-received as anticipated (the iPad?); a biotech’s latest drug doesn’t pass clinical trials; the company’s novel products suddenly have competitors, etc. And the best of the bad news… 4.Accounting scandals; key management changes; government intervention; new regulations that will adversely affect the company’s bottom line, etc.Certainly, there are many other reasons why a stock will underperform; these are only a few of the more typical explanations.A current covered put play: Sandisk (SNDK) On Friday (1/29), the stock of chip-maker Sandisk fell almost 12% from the close on Thursday to the close on Friday.Why? On the not particularly bad news that revenues were what analysts expected. (See? This is a sign of a correction in progress.) According to a Wedbush-Morgan analyst, expectations for the company were running high (particularly since it’s part of the iPad story) and investors were disappointed that the company didn’t beat expectations.Taking in the broader picture, shares of fellow chip-makers Micron Technologies (NASDAQ:MU), EMC (EMC), and Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) all lost ground along with the semiconductor ETF, the SMH.Looking at the stock chart of Sandisk, we can see that it gapped through key support at $28. It’s showing minor support at the even $2 levels ($24, $22) with major support at $20.Using end of day data for stock and options prices, here’s how the February covered put fares for the closest strike prices (the stock closed Friday at $25.42).Depending on your risk/reward profile, you can see how investing in OTM (below $25) strikes differs from the ITM (above $25) strikes. If you think that your particular stock and/or the market may rebound before expiration, sell an ITM strike (the exact strike price depending on your degree of unbearishness). On the other hand, if you believe the opposite, sell an OTM strike.Repair strategies If the stock in your covered put starts to move up, you can either buy back your put option and close out your short stock position, or keep your short position and roll up your put position to a higher strike price. This is where experience in playing this type of option strategy is very helpful.Summary The point of this post is to educate those of you who are options savvy and unafraid of shorting stocks as to a strategy that can be used to your advantage when the market is in a correctional phase.

Revenue for the quarter exceeded the company’s expectation of $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion, due to a substantial increase in Product revenue, although the decline in License & Royalty revenue was a spoiler. This apart, the company’s results were positively impacted by higher OEM revenues from new channels, which are expected to continue in the next quarter. Retail sales were also strong in the quarter and witnessed growth in all end-markets.  Total revenue for the quarter included $1.14 billion in Product revenue (an increase of 54.0% year-over-year and 40.0% sequentially) and $99.6 million in License & Royalty revenue (down 18.0% year-over-year and 18.0% sequentially). The increase in Product revenue can be attributed to the increase in gigabytes sold. Gigabytes sales increased 100.0% year-over-year and 44.0% sequentially.This apart, price per gigabyte was down 23.0% year over year and 2.0% sequentially. Total memory units sold in the fourth quarter was up 55.0% on a year-over-year basis and up 22.0% sequentially.Operating ResultsProduct gross margin in the quarter was 45.0% on a non-GAAP basis versus product loss margin of 61.0% on a non-GAAP basis in the year-ago quarter. Product gross profit for the quarter included a $95.0 million benefit primarily from the sale of previously reserved inventory, and was positively impacted by stronger cost reductions which were 20% per gigabyte.Product gross profit on GAAP basis for the third quarter was $510.0 million, compared to a product gross loss of $462.0 million in the year-ago quarter. Operating profit on GAAP basis was $376.0 million compared to a GAAP operating loss of $1.63 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 while the company reported a non-GAAP operating profit of $417.0 million in the fourth quarter, compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $568.0 million in the year-ago quarter.Net income on a GAAP basis for the quarter was $340.0 million or $1.45 per share, compared to a GAAP net loss of $1.76 billion or $7.78 in the year-ago quarter. Including the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, non-cash economic interest expense, and related tax adjustments, non-GAAP net income for the quarter came in at $277.0 million or $1.18 per share versus a net loss of $359.0 million or $1.59 reported in the year-ago period. The latest quarter’s results were favorably impacted by higher OEM volumes, substantial reduction in cost of sales, modest pricing and improved industry fundamentals.Balance SheetSanDisk generated $388.0 million in cash from operating activities, compared to $238.4 million in the third quarter. Cash and short-term investments were $1.91 billion compared to $1.45 billion at the end of the third quarter. Convertible long-term debt for the quarter was $934.7, an increase of $15.2 million from $919.5 million reported in the previous quarter. Long term investments during the fourth quarter stood at $1.09 billion. Guidance   SanDisk is forecasting total revenue for the first quarter between 875 million, and 950 million, including License & Royalty revenue of between $80 million and $90 million. The License & Royalty revenue forecast for the first quarter includes revenues expected from the Samsung license agreement. For the full year 2010, the company expects total revenue between $4.0 billion and $4.4 billion, including license and royalty revenue between $320.0 million and $360.0 million."

I have been tracking the company for a few years now and it seems as though people have lost faith in the storage space and the company.I think this is unjust because we are getting more and more information from the internet these days and there are increasing users of the internet. It only points to one thing - we need more storage space for movies, music and photos.The world's data is only increasing and at a faster speed than many expected. This will lead to an increasing demand for the storage devices created by Western Digital and its peer Seagate Technologies (NASDAQ:STX).Let's turn to valuations. WDC has about $10 of net cash on its balance sheet. Take that out, and you are effectively paying $28 for the company.I estimate WDC will earn about $6.60 this year and $6.90 in 2011. Now given that it has handsomely beat expectations of mine and that of sell side analysts, there is upside potential to this number. However, I think downside is limited because the underlying demand is very strong and will continue to be so in the next months and years.From a P/E stand point, the company has a P/E of 4.2 for 2010 earnings ex cash and 4.0 given 2011 earnings expectations. Now it could be even cheaper given that cash will grow through next year and international revenue might accelerate faster than expected.The point I want to emphasize here is that this stock offers great upside potential with limited downside and WDC is not going to be bankrupt anytime soon. The catalyst will be its consistent strong earnings each quarter as people recognize the true value of WDC and bid it higher.Price Target : $76 Jan 2012Disclosure: Long WDC"

The consensus estimate is $1.36 for EPS and $$2.35B for revenue, according to First Call. Western Digital had guided revenue in the range of $2.25B-$2.35B, a flat sequential gross margin, and opex of approximately $200M which results in a non-GAAP EPS in the range of $1.26-$1.36. But by the time 2009 ended, the two biggest hard-disk drive makers, Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) and Western Digital had put in performances that surprised nearly everyone, with Seagate's stock rose 300% and Western Digital climbed 280% for the year. Analysts who follow the hard-disk drive market say there are reasons to believe Seagate and Western Digital can build upon their 2009 strengths, at least through the first half of 2010. Stifel Nicolaus would expect Western Digital to report upside relative to the company's initial guidance and current consensus expectations, given the firm's favorable/stable pricing checks, and an anticipation of some incremental revenue contributions from the company's initial entry into the enterprise-class drive market. Stifel's Q2 estimate is $2.32B in revenue and $1.34 in EPS, but would view upside potential to be in the range of $2.38B and $1.44. Stifel's Q2 estimates do not include any contributions from the company's entry into the enterprise market, which is conservative given that the company announces products upon volume shipments. Stifel notes that over the past several quarters Western Digital has provided interesting details with regard to overall HDD inventory trends. With the December quarter having looked to reflect positive demand through the final few weeks of the quarter, the firm expects Western Digital to again provide positive data points on overall HDD industry inventory levels as we head into the March quarter."

The consensus estimate is 26c for EPS and $787.94M for revenue, according to First Call. Company guidance provided on its last earnings call was for Q3 revenue of $725M-$775M. SanDisk has been the subject of some conflicting sentiment of late. Earlier this week, the UBS analyst cut his rating on the stock to Sell; several weeks earlier, Merrill Lynch raised its rating to Buy. Needham repeated its Underperform rating on the stock. Needham thinks that stronger pricing should allow the company to beat revenue guidance, but believes upside could be limited by slower demand for flash cards and USB drives in the back-to-school season. The firm contends that the stock already discounts earnings upside for the quarter. Wedbush expects SanDisk Q3 results to exceed the Street and their 26c/$795M estimates driven by robust card prices and limited NAND supply. The firm expects SanDisk to provide Q4 guidance ahead of estimates, due to strong product positioning in retail card/USB market and seasonality. However, Wedbush maintains its Neutral rating and $20 price target. The firm continues to remain cautious on SanDisk as it believes with Q4 being the seasonal peak for NAND end market demand from the retail card market that all the good news could already be priced in."

While Stifel's gross margin estimate comes in at 19%, it could still see upside potential. Stifel's operating expense estimate remains unchanged at $175M, in-line with guidance. The firm's non-GAAP EPS estimate equates to 84c, vs. guidance of 75c-82c, though a 21% gross margin would equate to EPS upside to as high as $1.00.

Revenue exceeded the company’s expectation of $725.0 million to $775.0 million, due to a sequential increase in both Product revenue and License & Royalty revenue. This apart, the company’s results were positively impacted by order strength at its OEM customers, which is expected to continue in the fourth quarter.  Total revenue for the quarter included $814.0 million in Product revenue (an increase of 18.0% year over year and 33.0% sequentially) and $121.3 million in License & Royalty revenue (down 8.0% year over year and up 1.0% sequentially). The increase in Product revenue can be attributed to the increase in gigabytes sold. Gigabytes increased 107.0% year-over-year and 37.0% sequentially. This apart, Average retail card capacity was up 46.0% year-over-year and down 1.0% sequentially. License & Royalty revenue increased primarily due to higher-than-anticipated prices of License sales. Within Product revenue, OEM channel sales were the highlight of the quarter, contributing 56.0% of total Product revenue. Operating Results  Product gross margin in the quarter was 39.0% on a non-GAAP basis versus product loss margin of 17.0% on a non-GAAP basis in the year-ago quarter. The quarter’s product gross profit included $139 million benefit primarily from the sale of previously reserved inventory, and was positively impacted by lower cost of sales, as there was a cost reduction per gigabyte, which was in the high teens in the third quarter. GAAP product gross profit for the quarter was a negative $315.0 million, compared to a product gross loss of $138.0 million in the year-ago quarter. GAAP operating profit was $240 million compared to GAAP operating loss of $250.0 million in the third quarter of 2008 and GAAP operating profit of $68 million in the second quarter of 2009.

Heading into the second half, he writes, “we are concerned that production ramps” -Mok expects higher output from both Samsung and Toshiba - “will swing the NAND sector into over supply.”Mok says the Street expects Q2 to bear estimates due to conservative guidance, but he notes that Q3 guidance could disappoint if price declines accelerate. “We believe SNDK will pull back on further declines in NAND prices, and recommend investors sell shares,” he writes.SNDK Thursday is down 93 cents, or 6.2%, to $14.12.Original post"

During the last week Needham and Thomas Weisel raised their estimates on Western Digital. The storage device maker has topped expectations for five consecutive quarters.

Needham expects the company to report at or above the high-end of guidance. Needham believes that demand conditions gradually improved for Western Digital throughout the quarter. Aggressive pricing on consumer electronics by competitors may have partially offset the improvement, causing Needham to leave their margin estimate at 14.3%. Needham expects Western Digital to fully capitalize on the precedent set by Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) for a ""flattish"" sequential June. Needham estimates Q4 at $1.47B and 12c.

140142,20504,2009-05-28T09:53:25-04:00,,"SanDisk (SNDK) had a wild day Wednesday, gaining over 14% and helping the NASDAQ outperform the other major averages. Was it warranted?The news that drove the stock today was related to SanDisk reaching an agreement with Samsung who manufactures NAND memory chips using technology covered by SanDisk patents. The previous seven year deal will expire in August of this year and investors were holding their breath waiting to see how the negotiations for a new deal would play out. Now we know.The companies have entered into another seven year agreement. This is good for both companies in that Samsung is now sure that it will have uninterrupted access to SanDisk's patents and SanDisk, in turn, will have a consistent, reliable revenue stream from the royalties. So far so good.Samsung, however, will in the future be paying roughly half what the current agreement stipulates. In other words, the $350M that SanDisk receives on an annual basis now will be reduced to about $175M. As a sweetener for SanDisk, Samsung has committed to guarantee providing a portion of its NAND output to SanDisk. This helps SanDisk who derives 60% of their revenue by selling flash memory cards in the retail market by ensuring a steady source of supply at predictable prices.So it would seem that cutting royalties in half should not be the kind of news that drives a stock up. In this case, however, investors seem willing to overlook the decrease. With Samsung the largest source of royalties for SanDisk and producer of 30% of flash memory worldwide, it was imperative for SanDisk that the two companies come to some kind of agreement. With SanDisk pulling in over $3 billion in sales annually, the royalties are a significant portion of revenue but are far outweighed by sales of physical chips. Which brings me to my next point.Investors seem to be willing to give SanDisk the benefit of the doubt because NAND flash memory prices have gone from a low of $1 per gigabyte back in January up to $2 per gigabyte. As supply and demand have come more into balance, this is the best kind of news for SanDisk's margins and, as pointed out above, chip sales do have greater impact on the company's bottom line than royalties.Furthermore, SanDisk's CEO has been communicating optimism to the investing community.He has indicated that the balance sheet is in much better shape lately, especially after receiving a cash infusion from Toshiba based on an agreement that turns over 30 percent of SanDisk's share of the current manufacturing capacity of the companies' joint ventures to Toshiba. In exchange, SanDisk is getting equipment-leasing cost reductions and cash amounting to about $1 billion.CEO Eli Harari has also said that he was ""cautiously optimistic"" and that consumer demand has been stronger than expected. As the leading manufacturer of retail flash cards for phones and digital cameras, that is an outlook, if eventually justified by actual sales, that should indeed support the stock price.So was Wednesday's action justified? Probably not. The pop in the stock price (you can see the big gap up on the chart above) is based more on optimistic expectations than on solid results. If the strength in the retail market for flash memory begins to flag, it will be no surprise to see SanDisk start to slide again. It's true that the stock was severely beaten down but it has already nearly doubled since the March low. The stock is now susceptible to the vagaries of consumer spending and, if the market in general declines, SanDisk will follow suit.Disclosure: no positions"

And forecasting total revenue for Q2 between $650M to $725M, including license and royalty revenue between $85M to $95M. Our Q2 non-GAAP product gross margin should continue to improve based on stable to slightly higher pricing and reduced product costs, although this will be partially offset by more expensive yen-based wafer purchases, primarily from late Q4 and early Q1, that will be reflected in Q2 cost of sales."" Stifel Nicolaus said that based on some of their end of quarter channel checks, as well as discussions at Semicon West, it believes SanDisk will exceed consensus estimates for June and provide a better-than-expected outlook for the September quarter. Consensus for Q3 is (9c) on $774.81M in revenue. The firm believes the company, and the overall NAND flash market, has seen a pickup in handset demand, as well as continued strength in many Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)-based products, including the iPhone 3GS. Importantly, pricing during the June quarter has actually risen, and Stifel suspects that positive market conditions will continue into the September quarter, where it gets a boost from back-to-school sales. Stifel believes analysts/investors will be monitoring closely management's commentary on the NAND flash market, which it believes could lead to a partial resumption in memory capex spending."
139031,20307,2009-05-21T16:00:43-04:00,,"Spot market pricing of NAND flash memory chips have stabilized at about the $2/GB level, more than twice the price at the December quarter bottom, SanDisk (SNDK) CEO Eli Harari said today in an interview with Tech Trader Daily.Harari says prices have been stable throughout April and May. He says the recent price moves, with a sharp, sustained climb after a precipitous drop, is an unprecedented development, and “a major improvement for the industry.”Harari says the biggest factor in the stabilization of pricing has been the voluntary reduction in capacity utilization rates by Samsung, Toshiba and SanDisk, which together control at least 80% of global NAND flash production. Harari notes that both SanDisk and Toshiba cut capacity utilization by 30%, with Samsung reducing output as well, though without specifying how much. Harari says the results is that supply and demand have come into balance, with very little if any excess inventory legt inthe channel.Meanwhile, on the demand side of the equation, Harari ntoes that SanDisk had a “surprisingly robust” first quarter, selling a record number of MB of memory, more than expected for the typically seasonally soft March quarter. He says the strength continued into April. Areas of strength, he says, include flash drives used by students for school, digital memory cards for cameras and mobile phones, where the market is growing as consumers adopt smartphones. Still mostly on the horizon, he says, is an eventual jump in the solid-state drive market.Harari concedes that some of the idle capacity could be back on line in two months, if demand required it, and he thinks some of it will come back in the second half as the market heads into the back-to-school selling season. But he also says that some capacity, particularly lines based on 8-inch wafers, has been permanently closed.  He says most of the players in the industry are still buying equipment to upgrade output to smaller line widths, but that the odds are against anyone inn the foreseeable future spending the $5 billion or $6 billion it would take to build a new flash fab from scratch.Harari declined to to give a forecast for the June quarter, but he did say that gross margins - which were negative 7% in the first quarter - are moving in the right direction with prices stable and costs dropping. A key factor on margins will be the company’s perceptions on Q3 NAND pricing, which affects the way the company values inventory.Harari remains bullish on the prospects for SSDs, and in particular think they offer an ideal storage solution for netbooks. But he also notes that at $2/GB they aren’t competitive yet with hard drives. Harari notes that you can buy an 80 GB HDD for $30-$35. That same $30 would only get you 15 GB of flash. He contends 32 GB of storage is probably enough for many netbook applications; to be competitive with hard drives, Harari says, the flash industry will have to be able to sell at $1/GB while maintaining profitability. That’s not possible at the current 42-43 nm process technology now used for manufacturing flash, he says. But it should be possible at 24 nm, or two generations ahead of the current technology. He thinks usage of SSDs will start to pick up in this year’s second half, hitting Main Street in a big way in 2011 “as Moore’s law gets us to the right cost range.”As for last year’s flirtation with Samsung, which tried to acquire SanDisk, he says that the situation is now long since over. Harari says Samsung wanted SanDisk for its patent portfolio and its know-how in multi-level cell memory technology. He says SanDisk declined to provide them full access to proprietary information unless and until Samsung signed a renewal of their IP cross-licensing deal. But he says Samsung refused, and they withdrew their bid. Meanwhile, Harari notes that the licensing agreement with Samsung expires in August; he says both sides expect a deal to be cut before expiration. Harari noted that he has previously said a revised agreement will likely result in a reduced royalty rate from Samsung. As Harari notes, royalty income was about 15% of SanDisk’s revenue last year, with a higher proportion of net income given the very high margins from IP licensing.Finally, Harari says he’s particularly excited about the growth of the smartphone market. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), he says, has started a “huge trend,” and provided a “major catalyst,” but that it will be not be the only company moving the segment forward, adding “I would not say that Apple has won the war.” He contends there will be “huge innovation in non-Apple platforms that will hit the market in the next 6-12 months, from Research In Motion (RIMM), Motorola (MOT), Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and others. The smartphone trend overall, he says, should drive “immense use of flash storage.” SanDisk isn’t that picky about who dominates the smartphone business - as long it keeps showing healthy growth.SNDK Thursday is off 36 cents, or 2.6%, to $13.35.Original post"

The consensus estimate is 28c for EPS and $1.59B for revenue, according to First Call. The data storage sector has been on an extraordinary run, with stellar performance among several names. Last Wednesday, key rival Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX) raised its forecasts for margins and overall industry sales, citing a larger-than-expected increase in corporate demand for computers. Investors are hoping Western Digital also turns in stellar results and guidance. In fact, most analysts raised their Western Digital estimates on the heels of Seagate's guidance. Consistent with Western Digital's business update on May 28, Goldman expects the company's Q4 revenue to come in at the higher-end of the company’s target range of $1.45B-$1.6B, driven by ongoing turnaround in HDD industry fundamentals. The firm expects Western Digital's EPS, ex-restructuring, to be at the high-end of the company’s target range of 16c-26c or slightly above, driven by higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin and cost cuts. Goldman is estimating $1.6B and 26c. The firm believes Western maintained its share in the 3.5"" desktop HDD segment in the June quarter, while the company gained back its lost share in the 2.5"" notebook HDD segment. Better-than-expected HDD industry unit shipments and higher utilization should partially offset the typical seasonal gross margin decline in the June quarter, with Goldman's gross margin estimate of 15.7%, down 20bp quarter-over-quarter. Looking forward: Goldman expects Western Digital to provide a September Q1 revenue target range of $1.65B - $1.8B, with the midpoint implying sequential growth of 9%, in-line with the average growth quarter-over-quarter growth over the past five September quarters. This range brackets Goldman's and the Street’s estimate of $1.74B."

The consensus estimate is a loss (76c) for EPS and $535.04M for sales, according to First Call. SanDisk provided lower Q1 revenue guidance of $475M-$575M on its last earnings call. Broadpoint AmTech expects SanDisk to report revenues above the midpoint of its guidance. The firm raised its Q1 and Q2 estimates to the high end of Street expectations, as it believes supply has tightened further recently. Also, on April 13, ThinkEquity increased its target on SanDisk after the firms checks showed tightened supply in the NAND flash market. The firm thinks that SanDisk is receiving significant handset orders from Nokia (NYSE:NOK). Goldman expects SanDisk to report Q1 sales above the midpoint of guidance driven by more-benign retail ASPs and better than expected bit shipments. However, while NAND contract pricing has been robust in recent months, Goldman expects SanDisk’s retail ASPs to still be down seasonally in Q1, but start to improve beginning in Q2, driving upside to current Q2 Street estimates. The firm believes the stabilization in pricing continues to be driven primarily by supply tightness. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) seems to have increased orders to its NAND suppliers in recent weeks, which likely helped drive some of the recent pricing improvement, says Goldman. The firm expects supply tightness to continue, driving more acute shortages in 2H09, as well as better ASPs and margins, even in the absence of a seasonal pick up in end market unit demand. Goldman's Q2 estimate is a loss (1.13) on $586.7M in sales. First Call consensus is a loss (50c) on $575.94M in sales. Goldman expects SanDisk’s shares to continue to do well as pricing trends recover. However, they believe that the company’s impending renegotiation of the royalty agreement with Samsung could be an overhang on the stock for the next two quarters until the agreement is renegotiated. Other near-term hurdles that keep Goldman on the sidelines for now are: a potential equity offering in 2009 that the company said could be in the $300M to $500M range, and a potential debt downgrade by the Japanese rating agency R&I."

They had expected the flash memory card maker to report fourth-quarter net loss of 60 cents a share, on revenue of $766.7 million. Instead, it reported an adjusted net loss of $1.65 a share.And thank God for that adjustment. Because without it, Sandisk’s Q4 loss weighed in at a porcine $1.86 billion, or $8.25 a share, thanks to a $1.02 billion pretax goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge.Suffice to say, SanDisk isn’t optimistic about its prospects in the months ahead. “First Quarter and 2009 visibility continues to be poor as seasonally soft demand is being aggravated the global recession,” Harari said in an earnings release. “With dismal Q4 and 2008 results reported by all Flash competitors, the Flash industry is at a crossroads. Three consecutive years of price reductions exceeding cost reductions have squeezed profitability out of this industry, even for the most competitive suppliers and this has been exacerbated by the global economic recession. Although 2009 is shaping up to be another tough year, we are very encouraged by the deep production cuts by the industry that we see as leading to the return of balanced demand and supply and improved pricing environment and much healthier growth for the survivors in 2010 and beyond.”Key word here being “survivors.”Original post"

The consensus estimate is a loss (60c) for EPS and $766.72M for revenue, according to First Call. Goldman expects SanDisk to report weak results and provide weak 1Q09 guidance driven by lower bit growth from the company's fab shutdown in December, as well as incremental pricing pressure in the retail channel. Goldman does not expect a significant stabilization in pricing until mid to late 2009. Although the near-term environment is weak, driving losses in the core business, Goldman's positive thesis on the stock remains intact. The firm's view continues to be that the market is significantly undervaluing SanDisk’s technology portfolio and believes that the company’s royalty business alone is worth approximately $10, more than where the stock is trading today. Goldman thinks that Samsung’s $26 cash offer for SanDisk in September suggests it will need Samsung’s technology in order to effectively compete in the market for the foreseeable future. Goldman believes that assuming a worst case scenario, SanDisk shares are worth around $7. Assuming that the Samsung agreement is successfully renegotiated, Goldman believes SanDisk could be worth close to $20. As a result, despite all of the headwinds for the company in the near-term, Goldman believes that investors with a longer-term investment horizon should be buying the stock given its extremely compelling valuation, even with a bearish fundamental outlook. Ahead of the earnings report tonight Avian lowered its estimates to a loss (80c) on $685M in revenue, with a product gross margin assumption of negative 25%. For Q1, Avian is estimating a loss (50c) on $558M in revenue, versus consensus of a loss (36c) on $631.71M in revenue.

On Dec. 17, Western Digital announced a series of actions to realign its cost structure with a softer demand environment and revised its revenue outlook lower for Q2 to $1.7B-$1.8B. The guidance was down substantially from its prior target range of $2.03B-$2.51B. Also, competitor Seagate's (NASDAQ:STX) December quarter results, which fell short of the company's negatively pre-announced target range, provided another piece of evidence that HDD industry fundamentals continued to deteriorate further in the last couple of weeks of the year. Goldman thinks Western Digital's revenue may come in closer to the lower-end of its pre-announced target range. Goldman's checks indicate incremental weakness in demand for 2.5-inch notebook and 3.5-inch desktop HDDs, with Western Digital's branded retail segment holding up relatively better, given its market leading position. Due to pricing, combined with lower-than-expected revenue, Goldman does not expect to see any seasonal uptick in the company's gross margin in the December quarter, with the gross margin down roughly 500 bp sequentially to 15.2%. Looking forward, Goldman expects Western Digital to provide a March quarter revenue target range of $1.55B-$1.65B, down roughly 8%-13% sequentially, bracketing its and the Street's estimates of $1.63B and $1.53B, respectively."

SanDisk was raised to a ""Buy"" with a target price of $22 on Thursday, a day after announcing a new royalties agreement with Samsung.Despite the new contract, and a recovery in demand for flash memory chips, analysts remain at polar extremes about SanDisk. Bank of America analysts, for example, kept their ""Sell"" rating, with only a $7 target price, because they believe that the agreement for half the previous royalties percentages is bad for SanDisk, because the deal covers two new technologies, x3 and x4, and they also expect a 25% fall in flash prices by the end of September.The fact that the deal was signed in May, not at the last minute in August, as many analysts expected due to the tough stances of the Koreans, may hint at the fact that it was SanDisk chairman and CEO Dr. Eli Harari who gave in, by agreeing to sign for half the royalties.Harari is a long distance runner, and explained his strategy over the course of two conversations on the day of the announcement at a shareholder meeting and at a special analysts conference call.Harari explained that in 2002, when the original deal was signed, SanDisk's MLC (x2) technology, which today rules the market, was then only at its early stages. Specifically with Samsung, it was only in 2005 that they succeeded to produce and sell at significant quantities. Therefore, only in recent years, when MLC sales skyrocketed to billions of dollars, they got to royalty levels that they didn’t even dream about in 2002 around $300 million per year - for SanDisk.Harari feels it will be this way with the new deal as well in dollar terms, the royalties will reach new records in 2-3 years and last through the end of the deal in 2016, despite the fact that the royalties percentage is half that of the old deal.Not only does he feel that the new technology will rule the market in 2-3 years, but there will also be ""monster"" markets by then in terms of size of flash memory usage specifically, smartphones and solid state hard drives (SSD) in computers and video game consoles, such as Sony's (NYSE:SNE). Sony's new game console will come with a 16 gigabyte hard disk drive in addition to a slot for memory cards.It need to be made clear that when x4 technology, which was developed by Dov Moran and his team at msystems, will go commercial, in the next 1-2 years, not only will SanDisk collect royalties on the flash chips themselves, but it will also sell the special controllers, without which the revolutionary technology can't operate, directly to Samsung, Toshiba, and others. Those controllers will be made by SanDisk itself or by subcontractors such as Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (Nasdaq: TSEM).Harari also mentioned that something else that came out of the tense negotiations with Samsung was good personal chemistry with the new manager of Samsung's chip division.Published originally by Globes [online], Israel business news - www.globes.co.il© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd. 2006.

Commentary from management on the mid-quarter update was: ""Thus far in the September quarter overall demand is consistent with seasonal patterns established over the last several years.""

""Consumer desktop demand is at the low end of expectations while notebook, commercial desktop, DVR and Enterprise SATA drive demand is tracking to expectations."" Thomas Weisel is cautious on WDC shares ahead of the company's Q1 results. Weisel's checks and analysis suggest Q1 results and Q2 guidance will disappoint, adding fuel to the growing fear that margins may decline. Following checks, Weisel believes the industry and WDC saw at least an 11% QoQ increase in total HDD shipments during Q1, consistent with the midpoint of WDC's forecast. However, on aggressive pricing through the quarter (notebooks and desktops), Weisel believes blended ASPs for WDC declined 7% QoQ, greater than its prior estimate of 5% QoQ. As such, Weisel had reduced its September quarter revenue estimate from to $2.06B and EPS to 70c. Guidance provided on July 24, 2008 was for revenue of between $2.05B and $2.15B and EPS of between 81c and 89c. Weisel believes actual investor expectations for revenue to be $2.05B and EPS to 70c. Weisel had also recently cut its December quarter estimates due to continued pricing pressure, to $2.21B and 93c, below consensus of $2.15B and 92c.

The wider losses were due to non-GAAP product GM of -17.5%, well below consensus and even worse than our Street low estimate of negative 3.5%. Weak GM was primarily due to severe price competition as SNDK had to match price cuts instituted by competitors' in order to move its products, particularly within the retail channel. Management is guiding to Q4 total rev in a wider than normal range of $725-875MM (mid-point down 3% Q/Q). We believe that results in Q4 will continue to be dominated by heavy emphasis on price promotion, particularly as we approach the holiday selling period, as card vendors (including SNDK) try their best to stimulate consumer demand to drive product sales and clear inventories. We are making adjustments to our estimates to reflect this view. For Q4, we are modifying our street low estimates to $765MM (-7% Q/Q)/loss of $(0.60). For CY:08 and CY:09, our estimates are at $3.25B (-17% Y/Y)/loss of $(1.07) and $3.07B (-6% Y/Y)/loss of $(0.81), respectively with the changes primarily coming from lowered GM assumptions (we are conservatively modeling product GM to average 4% in CY:09), partially offset by tighter opex controls.While we continue to like SNDK long-term it's difficult to be positive on the stock near-term given the bleak NAND environment faced by all players. However we remain in our belief that once we get past this cycle, SNDK will succeed in a leadership position in an environment where there is not going to be capacity add for a while. With SNDK shares currently trading at about 1.1x our CY:08 sales, well below prior trough levels of 1.4x, valuation remains attractive.

Equipment lease obligations will also be reduced by approx. $1 billion. This will further strengthen SanDisk’s balance sheet while reducing the company's NAND flash memory production commitments.As part of the deal, Japan’s Toshiba plans to expand its NAND flash production and increase its overall allocation of capacity in the two fabs. By acquiring part of the existing production equipment in use, Toshiba will be able to quickly expand its manufacturing capabilities at a lower cost and with a shorter ramp-up time than by procuring new equipment.The move is designed to enhance the production flexibility of NAND flash memory in line with the rapidly changing marketplace and to optimize each company’s business strategies.Dr. Eli Harari, SanDisk's chairman and chief executive officer, said:The chip industry is currently at a consolidating stage after the slowing economic growth hurt demand, creating supply to exceed demand. In the process many companies were forced to reset their strategies, their technical directions and even business models, some have even gone as far as considering survival strategies. Toshiba however, believes that the NAND flash memory market will continue to grow in the medium to long term with average annual bit growth rate of more than 200%. The company says its theory is supported by such established applications as cellular phones and digital camcorders, and by emerging applications such as solid state drives [SSDs] for notebook computers and servers. Furthermore, with now sole ownership of some 30% of the total capacity of the two fabs — Toshiba will become even more flexible in making decisions on production volumes in line with changes in market demand, thus avoiding a glut of supply.The agreement comes a month after SanDisk, rejected (at least for now) a $5.85 billion bid from South Korea’s top electronics company - Samsung, the leader in the $15 billion market for flash memory. Toshiba is second.Samsung currently pays SanDisk significant intellectual property royalties, estimated to range between $350 million to $500 million per year.Disclosure: None"

To his credit, it must be said that the closing chapter of his term as the bank's analyst covering SanDisk was far more successful than his earlier outing with msystems. Ellis, it will be recalled, provoked uproar back in 2004 when, as an analyst new to the semiconductor sector after previously covering energy stocks, recommended msystems at ""Sell"" and sent it crashing to an $11 low.The dismay was profound, since Ellis' own bank, Citigroup, had only just acted as lead underwriter for msystems' secondary offering at $18 a share. There can be no doubting that by taking a step so exceptional and bold, albeit misguided in my view, Ellis was essentially restating how proper Chinese walls in banks should look. It took many more months until he was finally convinced that msystems' business was seeing a positive momentum, following which he joined those recommending it, until its sale to SanDisk two years later, at a price three times the 2004 low.Ellis' ""Sell"" recommendation for SanDisk in July this year was far more successful than the previous one for msystems. Just as it seemed that the stock had already taken all the punishment it could handle, sinking to $14 despite the second quarter results, he once again showed his mettle, and downgraded SanDisk to ""Sell"" because of the harsh market conditions the flash chip industry was facing at the time.The share's subsequent tumble to its current low of $5.60, as he takes his leave of Citigroup, shows just how right Ellis was. He also got it right when he recommended selling the share when it rose to $23 in mid-September on the tail wind of the takeover bid by Samsung. He believed then that the chances of the deal going through were slim, and that Samsung's sole purpose in making the offer was to improve its position in the run-up to the new royalties agreement it is due to sign in the summer of 2009.Eltek - Surviving the massacreNearly every day articles are posted online, listing stocks which in recent times have been the victims of an onslaught that has sent their market caps down to levels that are absurd. I am now adding one of my own portfolio stocks to this list - Petah Tikva-based printed circuit board maker Eltek (Nasdaq: ELTK).Eltek operates in three sectors which are unlikely to enter recession simultaneously, and it also specializes in small niches not exposed to cutthroat competition from Chinese manufacturers. It is strong in rigid multilayer boards for the healthcare industry, such as, for example, the miniaturized circuits in Given Imaging's (Nasdaq: GIVN) gastrointestinal diagnostic capsules. It is also strong in flex-rigid boards for use by the military, with a range of special printed circuit boards that withstand harsh high altitude conditions or gunfire in military vehicles.Eltek's third sector is industry, which could enter recession to one degree or another, but I believe it won't in one go, as is happening at present in the consumer sector to which Eltek does not have exposure. Should the shekel-dollar exchange rate stay above the NIS 4/$ level next year, and if it wins just some of the big defense contracts it is currently bidding for, we are likely to see an earnings multiple of 3 to 5 for the share in 2009, assuming its price remains with the $0.70-1.10 range.Disclosure: Long ELTKPublished originally by Globes [online], Israel business news - www.globes.co.il© Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd. 2006.

It's called slotMusic, and it's basically an album on a thumbnail-size microSD card. Four of the major music labels -- Warner (NASDAQ:WMG), Universal, Sony, EMI -- are supporting it with MP3, unprotected music. So you'd go into a Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT), pay about $10 for the card, and slip it into your cell phone or any other gadget with a card slot. SanDisk says it will be almost as simple to use as putting a CD in a player. The MP3 songs can be moved around or copied anywhere. And you can write to the card, adding more of your own music into whatever storage space is left.I talked to SanDisk executive Dan Schreiber about slotMusic. Unable to imagine the iPod generation wanting anything to do with going to a store to buy music on anything made of atoms, I asked if this is aimed at, like, old people. ""Some of it is an age thing,"" he said. ""But it's about instant entertainment. Downloads continue to thrive, but not everybody wants to spend half their day curating playlists."" He added that slotMusic ""tested well with young guys who liked the gee-whiz factor."" Although, I always take those kinds of results with a grain of salt. Young guys can think a lot of things are gee-whiz...for about five minutes. Whether they'll actually buy it or not is a whole different question.There doesn't seem to be much question about whether SanDisk did this product well. It seems to be inexpensive and easy to use, and the deals with the record labels mean slotMusic will have plenty of content in a DRM-free format, which is what consumers want these days. The slotMusic cards are so small, retailers could carry a solid selection in a small space. If nothing else, it could be a perfect product for a booth in an airport -- where travelers might want new music for a flight but have limited ways to get it onto a device. Even then, we're talking about selling to generations that are less tech savvy -- and, generally speaking, not the biggest music buyers. But maybe slotMusic will find a niche there.""SanDisk is in the business of displacing legacy media with silicon,"" Schreiber told me, explaining the company's rationale for the product. ""We replaced floppy drives with USB drives. More recently, hard drives are succumbing to flash drives.Optical media will succumb to semiconductors as well.

The consensus estimate is loss (27c) for EPS and $778.12M for revenue, according to First Call. Guidance was materially lowered for Q3 revenues on the earnings call to $750M to $850M. SanDisk shares are trading lower ahead of its earnings report as analysts expect results and commentary to show ample evidence of a slowdown in consumer spending. Thomas Weisel believes SanDisk will report earnings in-line with its below-Street Q3 estimates of a loss (31c) and $753.6M in revenues. Weisel's estimates for Q3 reflect a muted consumer demand environment and a persistent over-supply situation in the NAND industry. Weisel believes SanDisk will guide below consensus for Q4. The firm expects muted consumer demand will likely to depress the outlook. Accordingly, Weisel anticipates that SanDisk could guide below consensus for Q4 which stands at a loss (15c) and $902.62M. Weisel's Q4 estimate is a non-GAAP loss (37c) and $853.7M in revenues. Furthermore, the firm believes investors are likely to focus on the prospect of SanDisk possibly being acquired by Electronics Co. instead of fundamentals. Analyst Bennet Notman at Davenport & Co. said he is expecting ""ugly"" results and forecasts from the company, given weak consumer spending and overcapacity in the market for NAND flash chips. Cowen & Co. analyst Daniel Berenbaum said SanDisk's announcement to to sell Toshiba Corp. about 30 percent of the manufacturing capacity of the companies' joint ventures for cash and reduced equipment-lease obligations, should be help the prospect for a deal with Samsung. Berenbaum said the Samsung-SanDisk deal has been at an impasse because SanDisk is reluctant to allow Samsung to conduct nonpublic due diligence."

Just about everyone else — including the four major record labels — seems to have given up on the business of selling actual physical copies of music. Why? Because it’s a crappy business, that’s why.The days of fat profit margins on compact discs are long gone, thanks in part to iTunes. But SanDisk is giving it the old college try anyway, with its “slotMusic” venture, which involves buying a 1-gigabyte microSD card with music, photos and other content on it, which you can jam into your phone or your PC (with an adapter).My hunch is that my friend Om Malik is probably right — this thing seems to have fail written all over it (TechCrunch is similarly unimpressed). The company makes a big deal out of how much space there is on the microSD card compared to a compact disc, but are people really crying out for more ephemera with their music? I think if anything they seem to want less. Then there’s the form factor. Can you stick it in your phone? Sure you can. But what about when you have more than one?I can just see myself with half a dozen tiny SD cards, each no bigger than an after-dinner mint, trying to remember where the hell they are and what music is on them. Sure, you can play them in a PC — with an adapter (which costs extra). And as Mike Arrington notes, a blank 1-gigabyte microSD card costs about $8.50. How can Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) or the other retailers involved sell albums on microSD for $7 to $10?Someone is getting hosed. I can’t figure out whether it’s SanDisk or the record labels — or maybe both. Stay tuned for the next big breakthrough: vinyl records on cereal boxes.Disclosure: None"

As you know by now, Samsung revealed yesterday that it has offered to buy the company for $26-a-share in cash, a large premium to the recent share price. And SanDisk revealed that it had already rejected the offer as way too low. SanDisk also asserts that Samsung is less interested in buying the company than it is gaining some leverage in the ongoing but stalled negotiations for a new licensing agreement covering Samsung’s use of SanDisk’s NAND-related patent portfolio.The Street seems a little baffled by SanDisk’s rejection of the Samsung offer. After all, the outlook for the NAND flash market is grim; prices have been plummeting, amid industry oversupply and softening demand in key end markets like PCs and mobile phones. The companies clearly don’t like each other much; all you need to do to get a sense of that is to read the letters the two companies sent each other, which I posted in full on the blog yesterday.So what happens now?Well, there are a couple of possibilities. Let’s run through them:So that all leads to these questions: What should the company do? What will it do? And what should shareholders do?Holders ought to pare positions, says Citi’s Ellis. “Abysmal fundamentals through mid-’09 argue to pare positions here,” he says. Cowen’s Daniel Berenbaum, who has been a bear on the stock, says that it is “tough to short the stock again until we gain clarity on posturing versus reality in what is now a public war of words.” Heidi Poon, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners, notes that “current fundamentals do not support a price target of $26.”Betty Van Hees, an analyst at Caris & Co., sees downside risk in the stock, asserting that Samsung is not likely to make an immediate counter bid, and that rescue from Toshiba or Seagate is also unlikely. Van Hees says she was “disappointed and surprised” by rejection of the Samsung offer, and complains that the SanDisk board is “looking in the rear-view mirror through rose colored glasses.”Several analysts are looking at it another way: the company takes the deal, or spends a lot of time in court. Vijay Rakesh, an analyst at ThinkPanmure, contends SanDisk now faces the choice of either taking the offer, or getting into prolonged litigation with Samsung over the licensing issue, “which we believe SNDK cannot afford given the state of the NAND industry.” Sounding a similar theme, Raymond James analyst Hans Mosesmann cautions that rejection of the deal “basically guarantees a hostile battle on the legal front regarding the licensing renegotiation next year,” noting that Samsung can afford “long battles of attrition,” which SanDisk may not.SanDisk today is up $5.97, or 39.7%, to $21.01."

In the lengthy missive to SanDisk chairman and CEO Eli Harari and vice chairman Irwin Federman, Samsung vice chairman and CEO Yoon-Woo Lee said he was ""deeply disappointed"" that despite four months of discussions and meetings about a possible business combination, SanDisk ""continues to cling to unrealistic expectations on both its standalone market value and an appropriate merger price.""""Notwithstanding the current market conditions, to stay competitive, SanDisk will need to fund critical investment and development over the next several months - cost cutting alone will not suffice,"" Lee wrote. ""Our offer insulates your shareholders from the risk of market conditions that have severely deteriorated and are expected to remain challenging.""Lee said if Samsung were to acquire SanDisk, it would operate the acquired company as a separate subsidiary and would not cut any jobs.After Samsung's letter was made public, SanDisk issued a press release confirming its rejection of the offer. The Milpitas, Calif.-based company said Samsung's offer represents a 55% discount to SanDisk's 52-week high stock value of $56, is an attempt to take advantage of the company's depressed stock price and could be a ""calculated negotiating ploy or an attempt to gain leverage"" in licensing negotiations.""We believe we have the strategy, execution record, innovation and financial resources to return to profitable growth and be the flash memory leader in new growth markets in mobile devices, solid state disk, and portable consumer electronics,"" Harari said. Jim Handy, an analyst with semiconductor market research firm Objective Analysis, agreed that Samsung was swooping in on SanDisk during a cyclical downturn in the memory chip industry, adding that Samsung's timing was ""excellent."" While he said he believes that SanDisk's share value will return to well-above Samsung's $26 per share offer, it will not happen until next year.""This is a difficult position,"" he wrote. ""Shareholders can either take a stated offer at what might seem a very good price, or they can have faith that SanDisk stock will again rise above Samsung's current price.""He also said a Samsung-SanDisk marriage could raise concerns among antitrust regulators.""Such a merger should prove very difficult for the combined companies' competition and possibly to their customers whose negotiating power would become severely constrained,"" he wrote.SanDisk hired Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as financial advisers and retained Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.

Let’s for a second assume that Samsung [which already has close to a 50% market share in NAND flash] can indeed acquire SNDK [the #2 player with a little over 10% market share] - and keep the US and EU anti-trust gods happy...The question of the day is, “how much will it cost Samsung to acquire SNDK?”. There is a short answer and a long answer. The short answer is - not just SNDK’s enterprise value. The long answer is SNDK’s enterprise value plus off-balance sheet obligations [but, paying for these obligations buys SNDK the wafers it needs to make chips].Barrons’s published an article a month and a half ago on how SNDK’s off-balance sheet obligations will affect everything. I think that it is a non-issue. I am sure that there are a dozen lawyers looking over SNDK’s obligations that total a whopping $6.5 Billion, of which $1.8 is due within twelve months. Now, why does SNDK have these huge “obligations”?While SNDK claims to be fabless - and it is in the purest of definitions of fabless, fabless; the company has partnerships with various fabs - and, on a rolling nine month projection basis, guarantees to buy a certain number of wafers at preset prices. Sure, SNDK needs these wafers to make its chips, but SNDK also guarantees leases on property, plant and equipment. Out of the $1.8 Billion due in the next twelve months, a. $1.05 Billion was for fab capacity expansion - including p.p.e and depreciation; b. $225 M was for operating expenses; c. $474 M was for the purchase of wafers [that SNDK needs to make chips].Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF) [which benefits from SNDK's off-balance sheet obligations] is betting huge sums of money on future SanDisk technologies - including a hair-brained 3D cell, which I guarantee will not work. In fact, SNDK hedges in its own 10Q filing and says “For example, our competitors are developing new technologies such as charge-trap flash and three-dimensional technology which if successful and if we are unable to scale our technology on an equivalent basis, could provide an advantage to these competitors“. I think that SNDK has more to fear from Seagate than from 3D or charge-trap based technologies.Also, SNDK will generate royalty and licensing revenues of almost a half a billion dollars in this fiscal year. 70% of this is from Samsung, and this agreement needs to be renegotiated in August of 2009 failing which, SNDK’s financial results will be adversely impacted. Samsung could easily get rid of this $350M/year in royalties and licensing fees by acquiring SNDK.SNDK’s management is tenacious, always ahead of the curve, and the company makes sure that its engineering and marketing groups are always alert and firing on all cylinders. Since I know too many people who work at SNDK, I will not be too specific or share stories in this note - but will gladly share my thoughts with you over e-mail.My take:Bottom-line: I do not want Samsung to acquire SNDK.Notes:  SNDK’s latest SEC 10Q filing.Disclosure: Long SNDK.

SanDisk will still invest 50-50 with Toshiba in other factories the two share, which means, in analysts’ view, it still will have a financing problem. Caris & Co. analyst Betsy Van Hees writes that, “Toshiba [is] Only Interested in JV Fab,” the “only” here indicating that there’s some disappointment Toshiba isn’t taking more expenses off of SanDisk’s hands. Needham & Co. analyst Edwin Mok writes this morning that, “We believe this confirms our view the Toshiba will not be the “white knight”, but a fab buyout will make SanDisk more attractive to Samsung (OTC:SSNLF),” referring to rumors that Samsung may buy out SanDisk. Both analysts offer pretty bleak expectations for SanDisk’s quarterly report this evening, with Mok writing, “SNDK’s businesses are suffering from a double dose of share loss in emerging markets and consumer spending slowdown in developed countries.

While Samsung had previously said it might be interested in buying SanDisk, many on the Street were convinced that Samsung was more interested in improving its negotiating position on a renewed license agreement over NAND-related patents than actually buying the company. But today the skeptics on the potential for such a deal - and I count myself among them - have been proven incorrect.This is clearly not a friendly deal. The Samsung announcement notes it is “reiterating” its proposal to acquire Samsung, and includes a length letter to SanDisk’s management that makes it clear that the two companies had been talking for months, but that SanDisk had wanted a higher price. The hostile nature of the offer makes the potential regulatory obstacles to the deal - the combination would own a majority of the global NAND flash production capacity - all the more daunting.In the letter, Samsung rips SanDisk for continuing “to cling to unrealistic expectations on both its standalone market value and an appropriate merger price.” The company notes that the offer is a large premium to SanDisk’s recent stock price, and says the porposed deal would not require any financing, and would be financed by Samsung from cash on hand.In after hours trading, SanDisk shares have jumped $8.16, o4 54.3%, to $23.20.Here’s a copy of Samsung’s letter to SanDisk:"

SanDisk's battered shares rallied more than 30% while industry analysts all lined up touting the logic behind such a deal.But now that SanDisk's stock has been on the retreat for two days and no more news of the supposed deal has surfaced, one analyst is finally raising the not so remote possibility that Samsung is more interested in manipulating SanDisk than it is in buying the company outright.Lazard Capital Markets analyst Daniel Amir on Tuesday downgraded SanDisk to a ""hold"" from a previous ""buy"" rating, noting that its fourth-quarter results could come in below expectations, while the possibility of a rescue in the form of an acquisition by Samsung was remote at best.""Despite news last week in Korea that Samsung is looking at potentially acquiring SanDisk, we believe that this move is highly unlikely and is aimed at putting pressure on SanDisk in its royalty negotiations,"" Amir wrote. He also noted that he doubted SanDisk would be willing to sell the company at its current depressed stock price.Since Samsung and SanDisk already have a licensing arrangement, it should come as no surprise that Samsung might be interested in tactics that could help it gain an upper hand. There is, of course, still a reasonably strong case to be made for Samsung buying SanDisk outright, if it is intent on advancing its market lead further ahead of No. 2 player Toshiba Corp. (OTCPK:TOSBF) by breaking up Toshiba's partnership with SanDisk.

It will also widen the company's lead over Toshiba Corp. (OTCPK:TOSBF), in the $15 billion market for chips used in storage devices and digital gadgets. More importantly, will end the legal fight over the licensing terms between the two rivals, and enable Samsung to avoid paying royalties (over $353.8 million a year) to SanDisk on secure digital flash memory cards.In August SanDisk Corp. was the subject of speculation that Seagate Technology Inc.

It would also give them a huge share of the NAND manufacturing market - Ellis says Samsung now has 38% of worldwide capacity, with SanDisk at about 16%.But Ellis notes that pushing its manufacturing share that high will raise antitrust concerns. He also says that Samsung in the past has not been interested in the retail card market, where SanDisk is a major player. He notes that Samsung already has a lead on SanDisk in the solid-state drive sector. And He wonders if Samsung is simply engaging in “a due diligence fishing trip” ahead of the renegotiation of royalty rates a year from now.  Cowen’s Daniel Berenbaum likewise writes today that he is “somewhat skeptical” that a deal makes economic or strategic sense for Samsung. “We’re not sure why Samsung needs SanDisk,” he writes. “It’s also not clear that SanDisk is a willing seller.” One key issue, he notes, is how a combination would affect SanDisk’s current manufacturing joint venture with Toshiba. And he notes that Samsung has limited experience in big acquisitions, particularly foreign ones.  Goldman Sachs analyst James Covello says a deal would make sense - he contends that the royalty stream Samsung is paying to SanDisk is worth $4 billion to $5 billion, well above SanDisk’s current $3 billion market cap. And he notes a deal would result in Samsung getting royalties on the same set of patents from Hynix and potentially from Micron (NASDAQ:MU). But he also notes that the Toshiba situation could be an obstacle, “as there could be a change of control provision in the JV agreement that stipulates Toshiba has to be compensated if the ownership structure of the JV were to change.”And one other thing: Merrill Lynch convertible analyst Alan Yu notes today that a SanDisk takeover by Samsung would likely trigger the change-of-control provision of SNDK’s 1% convertible due 2013. That provision would allow holders to put the convert back to the company and demand payment at par plus accumulated interest.

Well, I chatted with R.W. Baird & Co. analyst Tristan Gerra this morning, who says he thinks the jump is about folks assuming the worst is in the stock. “Investors may think worst news for the year. Maybe incentive to buy on the bad news,” opines Gerra.Specifically, SanDisk filed its actual 10Q with the SEC last night, and there are some ugly things in it, that, taken in one perspective, could make you think things can’t get any worse.First off, there are a number of off-balance-sheet obligations that worry investors as to the ability of SanDisk to fund its business over time. Gerra notes that SanDisk has broken some covenants in leases that it takes for facilities in its flash memory joint venture with Toshiba. Gerra notes that “The leases could be called, which could trigger a call on another $484 million in leases,” obligation for SanDisk. He notes that SanDisk IR has told him that it’s “unlikely” the leases will be called. Gerra also observes that the total cash needs for SanDisk in these next two quarters are $1.8 billion, up from $753 million a year ago. Operating expense commitments “ballooned,” in Gerra’s term, six-fold last quarter. And free cash flow will go deeper into the red, Gerra estimates, in the second half, falling to negative $229 million these next two quarters from negative $220 million in the first half.Like I said, bad news that may make some people see silver linings. Gerra is Neutral on the stock, has a $16 price target, and says he “wouldn’t be a buyer” on this bad news. He notes that people think flash memory chip prices are stabilizing this quarter, after falling torrentially the first half of this year. But Gerra’s observation is that, “contract pricing [for flash] for first half of August is pretty dismal, down double digits at a time when pricing usually picks up in August.” He thinks that “narrows the window in which flash pricing can rebound this year,” especially given that flash prices tend to go down in the fourth quarter, historically.Nevertheless, SanDisk shares are currently up $1.10, or 7.22%, at $16.34."

The company said product margins are expected to continue to be under pressure in Q2 with the anticipated benefit of low cost 43-nanometer and 3-bits per cell coming in the second half of the year. A weakening consumer market in the U.S. and China has dampened sell through in end-markets. Since then, many of the analysts on the Street have been adjusting estimates lower to reflect a number of issues, most notably a NAND market oversupply. American Technology lowered its estimates on July 17 due to steeper near-term ASP declines and its belief that SSD adoption is more likely to occur in 2010. That same day, Cowen said that it believed SanDisk was not prepared to the degree of industry capex cuts and NAND oversupply that is confronting the industry. Cowen saw risk to consensus estimates and multiple compression and reiterated its Underperform rating ahead of Q2 results. Additionally, on July 1, Pacific Crest cut its estimates for Q2, 2008 and 2009 on continued weak NAND pricing and sell through. PacCrest said that with the prospects for lower numbers, it believes further head count reductions are in the works and signal weakness may extend through 2H08.

Company guidance was 6c to 21c on revenues of $875M to $950M, down 8% to down 1 % QoQ. Weisel believes that sharp declines in spot NAND Flash pricing, which contracted 12% in 2Q, as well as sluggishness in demand drivers such as sales of digital cameras and handsets, represent key risks to their earnings estimates for SanDisk. For Q3, Weisel expects the supply/demand imbalance to continue, and therefore expects the company to guide below Street expectations. Weisel's revenue estimate of $1.081B is towards the low-end of Street's $1.04B to $1.24B range. The firm's non-GAAP EPS estimate of 36c compares to Street's 28c to 55c range, the mean at 40c."

I ended up selling WDC late last year because a number of analysts were pushing the stock back down to the low 20s (probably so they could buy more). There was mention of inventory being too high and solid state drives would be a thing of the past as flash drives would overtake the market.  Well, I guess they were misguided.  This stock has since mushroomed to almost $39 a share. And solid state still has an enormous lead as flash memory is still too expensive. I believe inventory will get ahead of slightly inflated sales projections towards the fall season.  The almost, but not necessarily, recession should start to hit personal computer, laptop, and digital video recorder sales later this year as inflated oil and high food prices have caused deflated wallets, and as a result discretionary spending will continue to decline throughout the rest of 08.  DVR sales may continue to rise…but that’s because cable and satellite operators are practically giving them away, which means decreased margins for companies like WDC.  PC and laptop prices continue to decline as well.  I can buy two laptops for what one used to cost in 1995. Now the last time WDC nearly crashed in 2002, I - the then misguided investor - was left holding the bag.  Inventory was a big issue back then for WDC and I predict the same thing will happen again.

However, NAND pricing could stabilize. The firm's checks indicate that Samsung is allocating 50M chips of 8Gb MLC to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in July and August, which could substantially reduce Samsung's inventory and reduce some of the price pressure on NAND and inventory overhang in the market. In the firm's view, while not a panacea for the inventory in the channel or at retail, it should stabilize NAND pricing. NAND spot pricing in the last two days has been trending up modestly.While bears have been calling for a renewed drop in NAND pricing, they believe the 50M chip order could remove a lot of NAND inventory and reduce a lot of inventory overhang from Samsung. Think believes it will also stabilize the NAND spot and contract pricing trends. If the pickup from the AAPL iPhone, given what they view as an attractive $199 price-tag in the U.S. and free offers in some countries, is ahead of forecasts, it could drive more allocations from Samsung and help stabilize NAND pricing through the quarterReiterates Buy and $40 target.Notablecalls: SNDK will trade over the $18 level today following this wonderful call by ThinkPanmure's Vijay Rakesh.

Since 2003, Street EPS estimates have jumped 22% and 43% in 2Q and 3Q, respectively (shares by 18% and 34%). Firm recalls that contract pricing risks shift to the upside from May to September (back to school and pre-holiday demand), though broader chip industry orders are most benign from June to August.

78087,20454,2008-05-20T09:18:07-04:00,,"Davenport reiterates its Strong Buy on Sandisk (SNDK) saying the selloff on CEO comments Monday appears to be overdone. SNDK shares sold off aggressively yesterday (taking the broader market with them) following comments by CEO Eli Harari at a technology conference that U.S. memory card sales were “relatively soft” in April and demand was similar to what the company experienced during 1Q’08. Dr. Harari also voiced his belief that high energy prices are likely having some impact on US consumer spending.
Firm notes they are surprised by the magnitude of the market’s reaction (down $2.42 or 7.5%) to these comments as they are in line with the tone management struck during its 1Q08 conference call on April 17th when they suggested that U.S. consumer weakness would continue throughout the balance of the month. Further, Dr. Harari indicated that SNDK’s business remains robust outside the US, as was the case in 1Q’08 when non-US sales powered the company to ~5% revenue upside versus consensus despite US weakness. Finally, as was stated during the conference, SNDK’s 2Q performance is generally heavily back-end loaded with the vast majority of the company’s 2Q performance yet to be recorded.
More importantly, SNDK indicated that it continues to expect business conditions to improve during the second half of the year as a more benign pricing environment and seasonal strength combine for much improved 2H results.
Notablecalls: SNDK's a buy here at $29 and change. See earlier piece."

Citi's review of broader NAND data suggests a buying opportunity has emerged. The typically upbeat Harari was noticeably restrained. That said, he indicated Europe remains strong (44% of sales), and left OEM sales un-addressed (all geos; 42% of sales). The Firm notes that understandably, SNDK braced for weak April US retail sell through data (cards+drives+MP3 players) in the afternoon's NPD release. However, it found SNDK bit growth was just 300 bps below seasonal averages (helped by easy comps) while ASPs were actually 300 bps better than seasonal. Separately, Citi confirmed with SNDK that its Europe and Asia market share trends are firm and the OEM biz solid. Firm concludes SNDK is likely working to keep Street expectations in check, in particular as: 1) much of the Moms/Proms/Dads/Grads selling season lies ahead, and 2) some competitors have recently raised 2Q GM estimates (2Q08 to be the trough). Overall, they are comfortable with their 2Q08, 3Q08 and 2008 estimates. While end demand risks persists, the body of evidence Citi sees continues to point toward steadily firming fundamentals into and through 3Q08. The Firm thinks positive EPS revision catalysts remain in play in July through October and on a target of $35, but with upside to $40 if multiples inflate seasonally. Reiterates Buy. Notablecalls: I think Citi is doing the right thing here defending SNDK. What we saw yesterday was just profit taking following the recent run (can't blame the bold ones who bought the stock in the low 20s taking some of it off the table). Citi has done a good job covering SNDK recently and I think the stock is a bounce candidate here. For the record, Lazard and JPM are somewhat cautious on SNDK this AM (FYI only). The stock's a buy below $30."

The consensus estimate is 26c for EPS and $810.92M for revenue, according to First Call. The revenue estimate is up approximately 18% YoY, but down 27% QoQ. With SanDisk, all eyes will be on NAND pricing. Amid signs of a slowdown in consumer spending due to the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis, U.S. market researcher iSuppli Corp. last week cut its forecast for revenue growth in the NAND flash memory chip market. The firm now projects global NAND flash revenue of $15.2B this year, up 9% from $13.9B in 2007. It had previously forecast 27% growth for this year. iSuppli's forecast for SanDisk's order growth was also trimmed to 8% from the previous forecast of 33%. Recently, Lazard Capital's Daniel Amir, who rates SanDisk a Buy, said a new iPhone from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be positive for NAND pricing and flash memory chip makers. Lazard's channel checks indicated that Apple is gearing up for NAND purchasing in Q2 in advance of the June release of the 3G iPhone. Amir believes NAND pricing should begin to firm up as we head into May and demand picks up from Apple. However, take note that when iSuppli cut their NAND forecasts, they thought Apple will likely cut its expected NAND flash consumption this year to $1.4B from $1.6B expected previously, but up from the $1.2B spent in 2007."

He’s seeing caution from European handset makers and slowing card demand in China and the rest of Asia. He thinks a “negative reset” is coming on contract NAND pricing.Ellis cut his 2008 EPS estimate to $1.23 from $1.29; for 2009 he goes to $1.40, from $1.73.

We looked under the hood to see which stocks in the MidCap ETFs might fuel that run.Based on this, we have highlighted one stock that seems to be undervalued and worthy of your consideration: Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC).WDC’s top and bottom lines are benefiting from:We can see room for a higher stock price on many fronts:We expect upward earnings revisions from Wall Street: For the past 5 years WDC’s has grown a more than a 20% clip. In the past 12 month its growth has accelerated to 45%. For 2009, analysts have WDC pegged for only 7% growth. The Correct Call believes that number is changing as we expect analysts to increase their outlook for 2009. Currently WDC trades at only .95 times sales, meaning their revenue exceeds the total value of all its shares. If Western Digital were to trade at the industry average of 1.65, WDC’s shares would be worth nearly $49.  WDC’s P/E should expand: At a current P/E of 9.10 and a forward P/E of 7, WDC is trading at a major discount to the industry average of nearly 25 times earnings, yet it is growing faster than almost all its peers. In our view, this makes no sense. Higher growth usually equates to higher P/Es. At a P/E 10, less than half WDC’s 5 year growth rate of 20%+, the stock is 50% higher in 12 months. We don't believe that WDC’s performance warrants such big discounts.WDC net profit margin of 13.8% ranks 2nd in the data storage sector and its Return on Equity [ROE] of 39.81% leads the pack. Perhaps the ROE is being aided by the company’s $500 million share buyback program, but not enough to slow down its earnings power. According to a study done by the Investor Business Daily, Most stocks tend to have 15% + ROE before moving higher.When you add it all up, growing consumer demand, likely earnings revisions, undervalued, strong earnings power, Western Digital looks like The Correct Call .Disclosure: none"
62050,20454,2008-01-29T08:49:45-05:00,,"I see couple of firms out positive on Sandisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) following earnings (see conference call transcript):
- Citigroup notes their bullish call on SNDK share has been the wrong one in the past four months. However, surprisingly robust 2H07 gross margins augur well for EPS revisions ahead if fundamentals firm as seasonal demand strength and supply headwinds converge in 2Q08 as they expect. US demand risks persist, though trough P/E multiples discount 2008 EPS power 10% below their just-lowered estimates, suggesting the stock may now be overshooting on the downside. Target to $46 from $57 for 89% ETR (aftermarket). Maintains Buy.
- Cowen notes that while rev. and OM are in-line with their ests., they were very positively surprised by the strong product GM guidance which we believe is being driven primarily by increased cost efficiencies as SNDK transitions to 43nm (from 56nm) in 2008. Firm is leaving their 2008 ests. unchanged as SNDK's full year guidance is largely in-line with their expectations.
- Avian Research notes that generally speaking they did not expect much in terms of good news from SNDK given the environment. Maybe a bit worse then they expected was SNDK assertion that MLC based SSDs will launch at the end of ‘08 rather then mid year - although no one realistically estimated any real volumes till ’09. Firm expects NAND pricing to hit bottom over the next two months.
Conditions will then improve, 1st lifting in late April ahead of “Dads and Grads,” perhaps getting another unexpected lift in summer from the Olympics, and then finally coming into balance in late ’08 ahead of the holiday selling season. They have actually been pleasantly surprised at the relatively benign pricing action they have seen so far in January vs their very pessimistic expectations, although like everyone else, they hold little hope that conditions will remain this stable. 
Firm heard nothing on the call change their recently positive opinion on the name. Given SNDK’s current valuation, the expected reacceleration of demand growth in ’09, continued yield and cost gains, as well as what they are sure will be a greater industry reluctance to add capacity, they think SNDK should be bought at these levels.
Notablecalls: Will SNDK end the day on the green side today? I certainly believe it could. Just check out the margins."

58480,20504,2007-12-27T11:56:53-05:00,,"With SanDisk (SNDK) getting ready to announce earnings on January 28, this is a good time to review the investment case for company. Back in November I wrote a post titled ""SIA Forecast strengthens case for SanDisk."" The main points were that the stock had fallen to a level from which it has twice rallied in the past and that semiconductor growth over the next few years was on the rise with the most growth by far in the flash memory category. With the stock at a depressed level and growth for its main product expected to be robust, it seemed like the stock could be a buy for patient investors. Then, as now, the company's growth potential in terms of unit sales was not the problem. Memory chip oversupply and pricing issues were driving the company's shares lower as margins became increasingly squeezed. This concern continues to plague the company. According to TradingMarkets.com, up until October, tight supplies had kept a floor under prices. But leading NAND flash manufacturers like Samsung and Hynix have improved their yields so much that when they started boosting production to meet the anticipated rise in demand for the year-end sales season, the market quickly flooded with NAND flash and the sense of tight supplies quickly faded. Last week, Micron (MU) reported earnings and they were not good, to put it mildly. The kicker for SanDisk was the comment in the Micron release that indicated NAND flash average selling prices were down 30% in the quarter. SanDisk promptly sank on the news. On the same day, iSuppli released a semiconductor forecast for 2008. The research firm believes that a slowing global economy will reduce the semiconductor growth rate to approximately 7.5% which, though it is still positive, will be less than the previously expected 9.3%. Their expectation is that the first half of 2008 will be weak and, with respect to NAND flash, they do not expect a rebound until the third quarter. In further evidence of flash suppliers shooting themselves in the foot, DigiTimes reports that suppliers have been willing to compensate memory module manufacturers for the difference between the current contract price and the spot price at a later date. This has actually prompted some module manufacturers to dump more chips onto the spot market in hopes of getting larger compensation later. Can SanDisk swim against this tide? SanDisk does have a few things going for it. The company receives royalty payments for the technology patents it holds. These can amount to roughly 11% or 12% of revenues. SanDisk has a strong retail presence. The revenues derived from their retail memory products (memory cards, music players, USB memory sticks, etc.) that are sold under the SanDisk name is nearly twice the revenues from their OEM channel. SanDisk is, therefore, more than just a chip vendor. Unfortunately, price-per-megabyte has been falling in the retail sector as well. A major OEM channel for SanDisk is memory for cell phones. There have been predictions of slowing cell phone growth, especially in developed countries where high-end phones are more likely to be sold. Low-end phones will still show growth in developing countries where cell phone penetration is not as high. Even low-end phones need memory so SanDisk will still see some benefit. SanDisk has been on a recovery trend since a very weak December 2006 quarter. Since then the company has effected some restructuring in order to reduce their expense base. Quarterly earnings so far during 2007 have been going in the right direction with the first quarter showing a small loss followed by the last two quarters showing positive growth. Conclusion: It appears that the flash memory sector is beginning to turn into a commodity industry. SanDisk is positioned well to continue to be a key player due to their large existing market share and intellectual property. To raise themselves above the level of a commodity producer, the company is emphasizing its retail products and continues to see strong growth in this business segment. The outlook for flash memory is expected to continue to be robust as memory demands in most electronics products continue to grow. On the down side, competition in flash manufacturing is fierce and oversupply not uncommon. As some of the Korean semiconductor companies seek market share at all costs, pricing pressure will more than likely remain a fact of life. At least one competitor, however, will not be ramping up so quickly. The Intel/STMicro joint venture to manufacture flash is getting off to a slow start with financing being stalled by the credit crunch. If SanDisk can leverage its strengths it can stay ahead of the technology curve. They could command premium prices by being first to market with more complicated, higher density, smaller footprint products. They could increase margins by improving manufacturing processes, using larger wafers and generating higher yields. They need to continue to build the retail channel and capitalize on their name recognition. SanDisk still has a chance to show superior growth but the odds are getting longer. The key is the retail business. If they only had someone like Steve Jobs running the show...  Disclosure: Author is long SNDK."

The company is a hybrid of both a growth and a value pick. Earnings are projected to grow by 13.1% over the next five years, yet Western Digital has a 2008 P/E of only 6.75.  Western Digital Corporation is the second largest manufacturer of hard drives in world. The company's products include 3.5-inch, 2.5-inch, and 1.0-inch form factor drives, as well as enterprise hard drive products, which are offered under various brand names that include WD Caviar, WD Raptor, WD Scorpio, WD Passport, My Book, My DVR Expander, GreenPower, and WD Raid Edition. WDC, a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy), continues to introduce new products. Last year, Western Digital was the first to the market with a 320 gigabyte drive for laptops, significantly larger than competitors' drives. The company continues to take advantage of strong demand for consumer gadgets, such as notebook computers and digital video recorders, which require ever expanding amounts of storage capacity. On Apr 3, WDC announced it was increasing its stock buyback program by $500 million. Previously, the company's program authorized $250 million in share buy backs. This new program will extend the program for five more years. In January, the company easily beat on estimates for the second quarter by 29.81% or 31 cents per share. Sales were up 54% in the quarter. Brokerage analysts have been raising earning estimates since that report. Third-quarter consensus estimates rose 21 cents to $1.08 from 87 cents in the last 60 days. For the fourth quarter, estimates are up in the last 60 days by 10 cents to 81 cents from 71 cents per share. Similarly, the full year estimates are also up.

which makes flash memory for portable electronics, and also sells those
nifty USB flash drives people carry on keychains, are getting a lift
today on what analyst Doug Freedman with American Technology Research calls a delayed Black Friday rally for the stock. Sandisk’s flash memory, Freedman pointed out in a conversation this
afternoon I had with him, is incorporated into several varieties of
global positioning system [GPS] navigation devices. Those portable nav
devices, or “PNDs,” as they’re known, did well on Friday, as Eric has noted.
Moreover, more and more cell phones are gobbling up add-in flash memory
cards to play music, which he thinks could be upside to sales volumes
for Sandisk this quarter.That could help Sandisk beat analysts’ numbers when it reports the December quarter results in mid-January.Ah, but here’s the rub: Sandisk also beat its numbers this quarter a
year ago, by 37%, and the stock nevertheless collapsed when the results
came out in January. And back when the company reported blow-out
numbers on October 18, the stock fell almost 20%. It’s all about the
forecast, points out Freedman, so any rally now has to contend with the
what Sandisk says about its business outlook come mid-January. Freedman has a Buy rating on the shares, and he cites two reasons to
be cautiously optimistic: for one thing, Sandisk shares are down over
40% in the last two years, which may give the stock a technical support
level at today’s price. The shares are certainly cheaper than in past,
trading at about 13x Freedman’s projection for $2.90 in earnings next
year (excluding options expense.) And, too, he thinks average selling
price declines this quarter may not be as bad as people think when the
company reports in January, perhaps down only 40%. If they decline more
than that, say 50%, the stock will be in trouble, he suggests. The swing factor: the DRAM industry has to cut back on supply to stem drastic price declines, which Eric has written about. If
that happens, perhaps this quarter or next, it means more chip-making
capacity will be switched over to NAND flash memory production,
boosting supply and hurting prices.Freedman is projecting profit of 82 cents this quarter on sales of
$1.44 billion, and he expects Sandisk may exceed that. His 12-month
price target is $60.Sandisk shares Tuesday are up 6.52% at $37.54."

Due to higher design complexity, lower number of usable blocks and longer test times, x3 technology is expected to offer approximately 20% cost savings over comparable MLC devices at the same process generation.The key innovation of the x3 16Gb chip is the write performance of 8-megabytes per second (MB/s).  
This outstanding performance is comparable to 5xnm MLC devices currently on the market and was enabled mainly through the development of an All Bit Line [ABL] architecture and advanced programming algorithms.  ABL will also be deployed on all of SanDisk/Toshiba’s MLC devices boosting write performance to 34MB/s – comparable to SLC devices on the market.Alas, the full cost benefits of x3 won’t be realized for another two years, the reason being x3 is currently about one year behind MLC on the technology roadmap.  
Nevertheless, Samsung and Intel (OTCPK:INCT) - Micron Flash Technologies (NASDAQ:MU) are expected to join the fray in 2008/9 and by 2012, 3-bit per cell NAND is forecast to account for 52.8% of NAND flash memory bits, followed by MLC NAND at 25.4%, 4-bit/cell NAND 16.6% and SLC NAND 4.4%."

The price is $149.99 for 8Gb and $99.99 for 4Gb. On October 18, SanDisk released its third quarter earnings. Revenue for the quarter increased 38% y-o-y to $1.037 billion. Its GAAP net income was $85 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, which was down 17% y-o-y and up 203% sequentially. Its product revenue was $919 million, up 36% y-o-y and 28% sequentially. Its license and royalty revenue was $119 million, up 52% y-o-y and 11% sequentially. USB flashdrives and mobile cards made record performances. In the USB market, it reached the top position in the European market in August. During Q3 alone, SanDisk shipped more mobile card units than it did in the whole of 2006. Demand was so strong that SanDisk’s supply was constrained and Fab 3 reached its maximum output. Fab 4 in Japan started production, and is expected to aggressively grow its captive supply in 2008. SanDisk also opened a captive production facility in China that will focus on assembly and testing of advanced Flash memory cards. Total megabytes sold in Q3 increased 248% y-o-y and 54% sequentially. However, average price per megabyte sold went down 61% y-o-y and 16% sequentially (which is better than the 26% decline in Q2). For the Q4 holiday season, SanDisk expects strong demand and megabyte growth to be in the range of 45% to 60% sequentially, and 200% growth for 2007. However, its annual 2007 ASP decline is expected to be in the low 60% range. Its Q4 product revenue is expected to be between $1.05 billion and $1.2 billion, and its license and royalty revenue is expected to be about $119 million in Q4, which is the same as Q3. On November 7, its chairman and chief executive, Eli Harari exercised options for, and sold 50,000 shares of common stock for $43.36 to $44.57 each. Its stock is currently trading around $36 after hitting a 52-week low of $34.43 on November 21. Its market cap is around $8.3 billion. I have to say, I still like this company, and if you are looking for things to buy when the market is low, and the peak retail season is round the corner, SanDisk is a much better bet than the retail stocks."

The purchases were occasioned neither by option exercise nor by a 10b5 trading plan. Marks’s SEC filings make for instructive reading. The Situation At $43, SNDK is trading somewhat above its 52-week low, and roughly at its low from last summer. It has already bounced off support at $40, somewhat above the March low. Volume has been moderate, except for the earnings release on Oct. 19, when it plummeted. Since the beginning of October, it has lost 20% of its value.The Company Most readers are familiar with SanDisk, the leader in Flash memory technologies. The highly profitable company has a forward P/E of 34.693%, a PEG of 1.06. Quarterly revenue growth YoY was 38.1%.On Oct. 19, the company released quarterly earnings of .54, beating the Street by almost 60%. Fears over the possibility of a steep falloff in the Flash market prompted a selloff, followed by a gentle slope downward to last Thursday. The InsiderMichael E. Marks seems to think this is temporary, having put up $2MM of his own cash the day after SNDK hit bottom. Marks is an experienced hand in Silicon Valley, having run Flextronics during its 90s bull run, which he followed with a spell at the KKR corral. He sits on the boards of a variety of tech companies, among them Sun Microsystems (JAVA).It’s instructive to compare JAVA’s chart with SNDK’s, because Marks’s last outright insider purchase was in early August, when JAVA was trading at a 52-week low. Since then, the stock is up 20%, near its previous highs. SNDK is the opposite; it was peaking in August, and is now in the basement.Summary This is a solid company with volatile earnings. Despite stellar results in the last quarter, the Street has priced SNDK down 30% off its August high, a clear overreaction. The only reason not to buy in at these levels would be a justified concern over short-term returns, since long-term growth in this segment is certain. The fact that a director who is himself an expert on the industry is evidently not concerned should lay that fear to rest."

A simple phone, sturdy with good battery life, it did the job: making and taking calls. I didn’t need or want anything fancier. 5 years ago it was the most advanced cellular handset. Today – a dinosaur. My wife however, in her good wisdom, thought that it was time that I upgrade to something a little more advanced – Nokia’s N95. I am ashamed to admit that I have been behaving like a little child ever since receiving it. I am thrilled. This baby does just about everything but make percolated espresso coffee. It’s got two cameras – a primary 5-megapixel camera (higher resolution than my digital camera!) and a secondary camera for video calls. Not only can it take digital stills – but also records high quality video. It has GPS Navigation capabilities with regional and local maps, a very functional daily organizer and planner, an MP3 player, radio and a video center. It is able to read pdf, excel and word documents and of course there’s e-mail and internet capabilities, and connectivity via wireless and Bluetooth. And there’s a calendar and clock too! Seriously though, it’s a nice gadget, with more functionality than I’ll ever really need. It’s probably one of the top-of-the-line handsets on the market today, up there with Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. Just like my previous phone, within 5 years it too will be obsolete. It is hard to imagine what technology will be available 5 years from now.It soon dawned on me however, that to really take advantage of the N95 I am going to need memory – a lot of it. The more, the better. (You can’t ever have enough memory!). I’m going to carry everything on it – hundreds of tunes, photos of the girls, you name it. Anyway, a quick look on the web reveals that the highest capacity of microSDHC memory available for handsets is a whopping 8GB. The mind boggles when you think of this. My first PC, a 1984 Apple II+ had 64kb of memory. The computer on Apollo 11's Lunar Landing Module, the spacecraft that landed Neil Armstrong on the moon, had 74kb of memory. But I digress. The gargantuan 8GB microSDHC that I yearn for is manufactured by SanDisk (SNDK), which brings me to my second birthday gift. The one that came in at end of market trading last Friday.A Gift From the MarketLast Thursday, SanDisk (SNDK) released its Q3 earnings report (see conference call transcript), and by end of Friday's trading the market had severely hammered the stock, which was down 15%. Since the beginning of October, the stock price has dropped by almost 24%. The questions that demand asking are: If SanDisk's Q3 press release showed significant growth, why has the stock price plummeted? Have there been any material changes in SanDisk's business in the last quarter? Is the market behaving rationally here?What Does SanDisk Do?SanDisk is the global leader in NAND flash memory technology. What's NAND flash memory, I hear you ask? Let's just say you probably use NAND flash memory several times a day. It's everywhere - cell phones, video games, PDA's, digital cameras, camcorders, television set-top boxes (like TiVo) and USB drives. It has replaced hard drives in some high-end laptops and is even in some of the newer model cars. It benefits from multiple revenue streams which include:Is SanDisk a Dominant Player in the Markets it Operates in? The answer here is a resounding YES. NAND Flash Memory ProductionAccording to SEMI ('Fabfutures' and 'Fab Capacity Report') SanDisk is the world's largest producer of data storage memory chips. It manufactures, via a joint venture with Toshiba via its 'megafabs' located in Japan. Fab 4, which commenced operations this September, is said to be the size of five football fields, and the most advanced manufacturing plant of its kind in the world.Retail - USB and Memory CardsSanDisk is the dominant player in all markets it has entered. It has approximately 42% market share in North America; In Europe, it doubled its market share in the last 12 months to 28% and indicated that it is experiencing difficulties in meeting European demand; in Asia and Australia market share is 23%.Retail - Media PlayersAccording to recent data from the NPD Group, SanDisk is ranked a distant 2nd in the US MP3 player market, with approximately 10% of market share, compared to Apple's 73%. The good news however is that whenever Apple sells an iPhone or iPod, SanDisk indirectly earns revenue in the form of royalties from Samsung, who make the chips for Apple's products.Does it possess an 'Economic Moat' (a durable competitive advantage)? SanDisk's economic moat is its business model. Based on tight vertical integration, SanDisk's business model has allowed it to remain competitive and protect its margins during the tougher periods.What are the Concerns? (1) NAND Flash is a Commodity – its pricing is VolatileSanDisk operates in an extremely price-competitive environment. NAND flash memory is a commodity, and is traded on an exchange, with daily pricing which can be viewed at http://www.dramexchange.com/. While SanDisk is vulnerable to this volatile market, it is less so than its competitors because of its low cost manufacturing capabilities.(2) 2007 SanDisk's growth was not organic, but mostly a result of the M-Systems acquisitionThe SanDisk Q3 press release announced: ""Revenue Grows 38% Year-Over-Year"", ""Product revenue was $919 million in the third quarter, up 36% year-over-year and 28% sequentially"" and ""License and royalty revenue for the third quarter was $119 million, up 52% year-over-year and 11% sequentially"". Impressive numbers, right? Well, not exactly. As Avishai Ovadia correctly pointed out in his blog (Hebrew), you cannot compare revenue and earnings numbers for this quarter to the same quarter a year ago - it's comparing apples to oranges. This year's Q3 data includes the revenues and earnings from the M-Systems acquisition. Last year's Q3 data does not. (3) SanDisk's Supply Cannot Meet DemandI think this came through loud and clear in the last conference call. That demand is strong is clearly a good thing, but when that demand cannot be served, customers seek the product elsewhere – and market share is eroded. Which brings me to my next concern. (4) Capital Intensive RequirementsIn early September, SanDisk and Toshiba jointly opened their latest fabrication facility in Japan - Fab 4 – larger than 5 football fields. According to SanDisk's July 2006 8-K, the cost to SanDisk will be in the vicinity of $1.5 billion (through to the end of 2008). SanDisk have already commenced discussions with Toshiba on constructing a new facility – Fab 5, but as was learned from the conference call, capital expenditure requirements for this plant are not expected to hit the books before the second half of 2009.(5) Samsung and Other Manufacturers May Aggressively Re-Negotiate Licensing AgreementsSamsung, the second largest producer of NAND flash memory components may grow tired of paying licensing royalties to SanDisk, and may aggressively re-negotiate these contracts in 2009. I am not able to provide a qualified opinion on this issue.(6) Litigation RisksSandisk CEO, Eli Harari received a grand jury subpoena as the US Department of Justice is looking into possible anti-trust violations in the industry .Also, the company, along with 23 other companies, are also being sued in a consumer class action that alleges a conspiracy existed to fix flash memory prices.(7) NAND flash may become superseded by a newer more superior technologyThere is always a possibility that this may occur, but even if a more superior technology was developed, billions of dollars have already been invested in manufacturing plants, cell phone design, etc. and I doubt that the new technology will be embarced. I think the probability of this happening is low, and that NAND flash has become the standard for the mid to long term.What's the Catalyst? What trends will benefit Sandisk's Business? The catalyst here is forecast NAND flash growth. According to Gartner Dataquest, current global NAND Consumption is estimated at less than 3 trillion MB. By 2011 however, the entire NAND landscape will be completely unrecognizable with estimated consumption at – wait for it – 33.5 trillion MB. This is mind-blowing growth!Do these estimates make sense? Consider the following:In short, the major growth driver will be the next generation of multi-functional cell phones. Just as I did with my new Nokia I95, users will realize the potential of these devices (high resolution cameras, mp3 players, GPD capabilities] and will demand significantly larger amounts of memory than we are using today.Another secondary catalyst to watch for is the trend towards laptops with NAND flash memory drives (called Solid State Drives or SSD). These are more reliable than conventional hard drives with moving parts, and allows for a laptop that is significantly lighter. While some high-end models are already on the market, the costs are still too high to hit the mainstream. If prices come down further, SSD drives for laptops may become a secondary growth driver for Sandisk's business.So What do the Numbers Say?SanDisk's Balance Sheet is strong:So What's the Business Worth?According to Thomson / First Call, 12 analysts have coverage on Sandisk, and the target valuation ranges between $45 to $75, with a $65 median. Lazard Capital's Daniel Amir, who in my opinion has a good handle on the company values the business at around $63 a share. Citi's Craig Ellis has a target price of $65If I performed a discounted cashflow solely on the royalty license revenues (which are in essense free cashflow) with the intial year being $450 million, 10% growth for years 1 to 5, and 3% growth for years 6 to 10, and a discount rate of 10%, I receive a valuation of $42 per share - or the current share price.A complete valuation of the business, with estimated average 5-year growth of 19%, provides a valuation of around $58 per share. This is a 33% discount to the current share price.So What do I think?Why did the price drop 15% on Friday after Thursday's earnings call? I'd love to be able to put my hand on my heart, look you in the eye, and give you a good reason. But I can't. I've never really known how to properly explain the sudden movement of crowds. Expectations not met? Perhaps. Lower Q4 guidance? Who knows? Fortunately, I do not assess a business because of price action. Instead, I try to assess what the free cashflows are going to be in the years to come, and formulate a rough valuation on that basis. This is not an easy thing to do with SanDisk or with this industry.Usually, I try to look at a 10 year history of a business before making an investment. When you analyze 10-year financials you get a feel how a business has been able to handle tough periods, whether it has been able to protect margins, or whether management has been able to create value for shareholders. Looking at Sandisk's 10-year financials is useless. The environment is changing too quickly. 3 years ago, a mobile market did not exist for mobile memory cards. Today it is Sandisk's leading product. This year there is barely a market for Solid State Drives - but that may quickly change.This is not a business that Warren Buffett would invest in. He would place it on the 'too hard' pile as it is capital intensive, because of its changing nature, and because of its low Return on Equity.I however, see value here. The NAND memory market is forecast to experience continued explosive growth and while it is true that the industry is highly competitive, SanDisk is extremely well-positioned to capitalize from this growth. It has demonstrated that it is able to enter new markets quickly, and because of its vertically integrated model is able to quickly establish a dominant position.If I was to place my bets on one player in this industry, it would be SanDisk, and recent share price weakness presents an opportune entry point.Disclosure: Author is long SNDK."

However, last week the whole sector took a belly punch with Micron's (NASDAQ:MU) poor showing in their Fiscal Q4 report, revisions from the sell side flew like feathers at a chicken fight. It all seemed pretty straight forward. Supply/demand imbalance, pricing tanking (spot prices have been running well below contract prices), and huge capital demand, all are weighing against the sector, not mention the ""whither goest the consumer"" conundrum weighing on everything. A surprising exception was Baird who kept their 'Outperform' rating on Micron, with analyst Tristan Gerra saying its business has started to recover. He expects the company to return to profitability in the next May quarter. But in a note to clients on Friday Baird advised that SanDisk's SD card pricing was down 3 percent and its miniSD card pricing was down 1 percent on average this past week.

Shozo Saito, president and CEO of Toshiba’s semiconductor unit.According
to EETimes, Saito said that the company can only meet 70 percent of its

SanDisk does not have any component in the iPhone, but is a beneficiary all the same because of the effect iPhone is having on the NAND flash memory market. For the record, Apple’s NAND Flash provider is Samsung for both the iPod and the iPhone. Founded in 1988, SanDisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) has grown to be one of the world’s largest suppliers of flash memory data storage products with revenues of $3.3 billion in 2006. Based in Milpitas, California, the company has more than 2,000 employees worldwide. SanDisk manufactures and sells retail and OEM flash memory cards, Cruzer® USB flash drives, and embedded solutions. Its products are used in digital cameras, multi-function mobile phones, USB flash drives, MP3 music players, and other digital consumer devices. SanDisk also licenses its technology to companies. It has more than 600 issued U.S. patents and more than 300 foreign patents. The Company owns 49.9% of three Flash ventures with Toshiba Corporation (OTCPK:TOSBF): FlashVision, Flash Partners, and Flash Alliance. It acquired Matrix for $296.4 million in January, 2006 and msystems in November, 2006 in an all stock transaction. Toshiba is where Flash memory technologies were invented, so the fact that Sandisk has a close alliance with Toshiba matters. For Q2 fiscal 2007, SanDisk reported revenues of $827 million, a 15% increase on a year-over-year basis. GAAP net income in the quarter decreased to $28 million, or $0.12 per diluted share from $96 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2006. The decrease was due to declines in the average selling prices of NAND flash-memory chips. During Q1 2007, the company implemented a cost cutting restructuring plan including workforce reductions and closures of redundant facilities that could see it saving approximately $21.7 million annually. However, with the increasing demand for NAND Flash especially from Apple’s iPhone/iPod and its competitors, the NAND prices are firming up. The company expects revenue to be in the range of $855 million to $940 million for the third quarter. Its stock has done well over the year, especially before and after the launch of the iPhone. It is currently trading in the range of $51 to $57. Its 52-week range is $35.82 - $62.24, but from March onwards, the stock has mostly maintained an upward trend. SanDisk has also launched its Sansa line of MP3 players, directly competing with Apple’s iPod, and has captured the No. 2 spot in that market. Consumers unwilling and unable to afford the higher price tag of the iPod have rewarded Sandisk with their business. It has also introduced its Sansa video players to tap into the growing online video trend. I will be covering the major online video beneficiaries soon in further detail. In summary, Sandisk’s current growth is due to the surge in MP3 players, music/media phones, and the overall convergence device movement. This trend will continue for the foreseeable future, offering the company continued momentum. The additional trend of online video may only add to their happy times."

- Piper Jaffray reiterates their Outperform rating on checks showing growing consumer interest in
music-enabled and data-oriented phones that should drive continued growth in NAND flash demand. Firm notes they were particularly encouraged store channels increasingly emphasized phonessupporting 4GB memory cards such as LG's new Chocolate handset, the LG Muziq, and the Blackberry 8830, vs. the 2GB cap for most phones. They also noted strong sell-through of the Nokia 5300 as the third most popular phone at T-Mobile.
Further, checks noted solid sell-through of the iPhone, which they believe was the top-selling smartphone at AT&T and contributed to rising AT&T store traffic. Firm believes success of the iPhone will encourage other handset manufacturers to launch products with increased embedded NAND densities. While industry bit growth may have been pressured by price spikes associated with Samsung's recent production disruption during August, they believe the trajectory of growing secular demand for NAND flash and SanDisk's plans to lower production costs remains intact.
- Citigroup is very positive on SNDK saying the pullback in spot prices does not preclude an upward move in SNDK near or intermediate term. Viewing Street 4Q07E and 2008E EPS potentially 40% and 17% too low, the firm expects rising EPS to propel the shares higher in the months ahead. The early-December, 2005 to early January, 2006 period (stock up 50%+) serves to underpin their confidence.
Citi's conviction remains high in SNDK's upside potential. They think that as investors re-engage following a tumultuous August, the 2H07 and 2008 EPS upside they can see to Street estimates (royalty revenues, product gross margins; CIR ests increased on Aug 9) will become better appreciated, fueling a handsome move in the shares. Catalysts ahead include new product potential for industry (video, handset, computing), SNDK-specific product drivers for C2008 (iNAND and SSD's) and benign 1H08 seasonality before a tight 2H08.
Notablecalls: I would not be surprised to see buy interest in SNDK following this call. Citi's comments regarding EPS estimates being way too low may fire up the stock. It sure looks like it may have couple of bucks of upside in it."

Forget the fact that revenue increased to 1.4 billion for the quarter (from 1.1 billion in the year-ago quarter) and 46% of revenue came from consumer electronics products, and products other than desktop hard drives. If you subtract the one time items for this quarter the disk storage maker still had net income of roughly 38 cents per share, at least a penny or two ahead of last year's June quarter (minus one time items) We will have to see what analysts make of this quarter. Perhaps they will say they are concerned about product price declines (which is normal for the back to school season every year). They may say that 46% was not a high enough quarterly improvement from 34% last year, and that Western Digital is still too dependent on PC sales.

As a result, the firm believes that ""338"", based on which Samsung is currently paying royalty, no longer has any teeth. Moreover, the invalidity of '517' brings to question the depth and strength of SNDK's remaining patent portfolio. As a result, the firm is quite confident that Samsung's royalty payments post-2009 will drop materially (likely close to or even below Hynix' ~$40m / year). This ruling is quite detrimental to SNDK's primary investment thesis (i.e. IP portfolio). If STM, a fledgling player in NAND flash, was able to manufacture parts in 2006 that were able to bypass most defensible SNDK patents at the time, surely Samsung by 2009 ought to be able to bypass all of them as well. SNDK bulls will say that Samsung and Hynix are already paying royalty, so SNDK doesn't lose much with this ruling. However, DB points out that SNDK is trading at a premium to other memory peers due in large part to the value assigned to its IP portfolio. No matter how they cut it, the firm does not see any reason to put new money into SNDK unless we see a material discount to their SoTP valuation (while today low-30s appears to be a good entry point, firm's view is likely to change with time). DB's base case SoTP valuation now drops to $36 from $39 (worst case is now $22 and best case $47). Maintains Hold. - Someone forgot to tell Piper Jaffray about the ITC determination, because PJ is out on SNDK reiterating their Outperform rating and $51 target saying checks show continued strength in data-oriented phones, as well as increasing consumer interest in video and location-based applications that should drive solid growth in NAND flash demand. For example, the firm noted solid sales of the LG VX8700 and Samsung u740 at Verizon (NYSE:VZ), the Motorola (MOT) V3xx at AT&T (NYSE:T), the Samsung M620 ""UpStage"" at Sprint (NYSE:S), and the Nokia (NYSE:NOK) 5300 at T-Mobile. In fact, the LG VX8700, which was the best-selling phone at Verizon according to checks, was highlighted by salespeople as offering support for up to a 4GB memory card, vs. a maximum 2GB for other phones.

I understand that Seagate (NASDAQ:STX) has more than double the market share of WDC; however WDC has kept pace with or exceeded the industry leader as far as technology. Both companies continue to surpass the boundaries of digital storage and have branched out into PDA, Navigation System and DVR digital storage. WDC continues to innovate; you can hold 250 GB in the palm of your hand with WDC's latest Passport product. Their latest portable external hard drives can store up to 1.5 TB. Although the USB drive market has come to fruition, STX and WDC have proven that hard drives continue to thrive with an increase in notebook sales industry wide. Seagate will generate over $11 billion in revenue for 08, has more debt than cash and garners a PE of 34+. WDC will generate over $5 billion in revenue for 08, has minimal debt, $875 million in cash and a PE under 10. This should tell any savvy investor that WDC is a bit undervalued while STX is a bit overvalued. So my mundane math abilities tell me that WDC, which has been stuck in the $17 to $21 range far too long, is long overdue for a breakout. WDC continues to see year-over-year improvements in revenue and profit. The March quarter included revenue growth of 25% from the prior year and a 10% increase in profit. If growth starts to slow, which is inevitable, they have the cash on hand to either develop new storage technologies or perhaps buy a company or two.  I have held positions with WDC since 1997 and I still fail to understand why analysts do not like this company, which is, in my opinion, second to none in the difficult data storage industry.

The agreement whereby Intel and STMicroelectronics will be combining their flash memory business shows how to tough it is to prosper in this industry. It continues the consolidation that began with Micron Technologies buying Lexar and SanDisk buying M-Systems. It also continues Intel's strategy of looking for synergies with partners, an approach that was demonstrated by their teaming up with Micron to push into the NAND flash market.
Currently, Intel and STMicro primarily manufacture NOR flash memory. NOR flash is often used in cell phones but that has started to change. Indeed, NOR flash memory has been largely superseded by NAND flash memory for the hottest consumer applications like MP3 players, digital cameras and PDAs. The fact that NOR usage is declining at a double digit rate is one problem the companies face. In terms of NAND production, they are coming from way behind in a segment that is growing twice as fast as the NOR segment is declining. Another problem is that their manufacturing capabilities are lagging those of other major players. Samsung, for example, produces chips more cheaply and more efficiently using 12-inch wafers. Intel and STMicro are still using 8-inch wafers.
SanDisk, Toshiba and Samsung are among the largest players in the NAND flash segment and they already have the state-of-the-art manufacturing capability to produce 12-inch wafers. This merger between Intel and STMicro's flash memory businesses will have little effect on SanDisk or the industry's other dominant players."

34180,20210,2007-05-02T03:40:27-04:00,,"Last Thursday, SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) published its financials after trading. This stock accounts for a sizable proportion of my portfolio, partly as an inheritance from M-Systems, but principally because I believe its price will reach three digits during 2008. Its results contained both good news and bad. The good news was that the company will significantly increase its revenue from royalties this year and in the coming years. The bad news was that it will take another quarter or two for the company to recover from the recent collapse in NAND prices. SanDisk has been pushing ahead with the break-up of what was once M-Systems. After the bombshell of the previous quarter, in which it announced that it was shutting down M-Systems' largest revenue source, the Disk-on-Key [DOK] product line for OEM customers, it has now announced that it will be winding up the joint venture with Toshiba for the sharing of profits on sales of MDOC mobile chips to leading handset manufacturers. This is a logical move, since in contrast to the small M-Systems, SanDisk is large enough to sell directly to Nokia Corp. (NYSE:NOK) and others, and it has no need for Toshiba's platform. As I see it, SanDisk's stock could reach a three digit price by 2008, thanks to two processes that will get underway this summer and which will gather momentum towards the end of year and continue into 2008, unless the whole world enters a severe recession. As far as demand for NAND chips goes, we are on the verge of a quantum leap for the first time since the summer of 2005, as a result of new launches of advanced handsets such as the iPhone and its many imitators, music and, even more so, video players, flash-based hard drives, computer game platforms, and other new applications that appear daily, all of which are due to plummeting flash prices. Even the cable companies' VOD servers will now store films on flash. As for supplies of NAND chips, SanDisk's CEO Dr. Eli Harari explained in last week's conference call that although everyone is currently talking about a surplus, the global market could soon find itself with a severe and prolonged shortage. He explained that there are presently many old fabs that are producing 200mm wafers, and the need to bring down production geometrics in order to remain competitive will make these fabs irrelevant during the next two years. Save for the SanDisk/Toshiba partnership, which will ratchet up the monthly output of its new Fab 3 to 150,000 chips by the year's end, and which in September will dedicate another massive foundry, Fab 4, which will start to contribute next year, there are virtually no mega NAND factories even on the drawing board anywhere. The new launches, coupled with the increase in demand due to the Olympic Games in Beijing in the summer of 2008, followed by the U.S. elections in the autumn, are likely, Harari believes, to accelerate the onset of a chip shortfall - something that will be a nightmare for electronics companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Should such a shortfall and rationing come to pass, SanDisk will profit twice over. It will benefit as an electronics company that produces its own chips and is not dependent on the chip manufacturers, and it also stands to gain once its net profit grows dramatically after chip prices skyrocket. Once that happens, more royalties will flow from Samsung, Hynix, and others directly into SanDisk's profit line. As mentioned earlier, an optimistic scenario like this can only go wrong if the entire world enters a recession so severe that there won't be any significant growth in sales of advanced handsets or digital cameras - two prominent examples of flash chip/card-guzzling applications - not even in the year of the Olympic Games itself.

Investors should focus on SanDisk's earnings bottoming in 2Q and outlook for 2H07. 2Q EPS estimate is $0.01 (down from $0.04 previously), and they expect an improvement to $0.15 (down from $0.17 previously) and $0.44 in 3Q and 4Q, and to $2.58 in 2008.
Bear Stearns is reiterating their Outperform rating and price target of $55. While the stock could react negatively to flattish or downward movement in NAND flash pricing, which may occur in May/June given that inventory replenishment is likely to slow down at some point, they would use any pullbacks to accumulate the shares and get positioned for 2H07.

We agree these will be drivers, but we fear there may be difficult news beforehand.” Ross cut estimates to 8 cents a share from 18 cents for the first quarter, and to 84 cents from $1.02 for 2007; he sees $1.93 a share in 2008.

According to him, Samsung has so far paid 6% on the MLC chips and a further 2% on the sale of every MLC chip-based SD card. It has therefore decided to no longer pay the 6% royalty on MLC chips themselves. If this is true, it is a further indication that flash prices have fallen to the level of the production cost. Some people even say that manufacturers like Hynix Semiconductor and Micron are making losses on their sales in the present quarter. Amir claims that Samsung’s decision will cut SanDisk’s revenue from royalties by 15% starting from the second quarter and accordingly, he has downgraded his forecasts, rating and target price for SanDisk. In doing so, he has joined the large camp which is currently waiting on the sidelines and which has rated SanDisk “Hold.” Amir’s previous estimates for SanDisk’s revenue from royalties were 10-15% higher than those of other analysts. This, perhaps, is the reason that the stock did not collapse after so dramatic a “scoop” since more than half of the value attributed to SanDisk by investors is derived from the high level of royalties, all of which goes directly into the company’s underlying profit. I assume that Amir has not based his latest assessment on a leak from within Samsung itself. I do believe, however, that the information may well have come from another company in the sector he covers, Silicon Motion Technology Corp (Nasdaq: SIMO), a Taiwanese manufacturer of flash controllers, which it sells in large quantities to SD flash card manufacturers. Its stock, incidentally, is the only one in the flash sector currently holding steady at its 2006 high. As of Sunday, Bear Sterns appeared to be the only investment house that has retained its “Buy” rating for SanDisk, despite the state of the NAND market in recent months. It was the only house that read the map correctly back in the summer of 2005 when the stock was trading at $20-25, and called on investors to pile in, since SanDisk could look forward to a mega-size market. That rating duly sent SanDisk rocketing to $80. Bear Sterns now claims that with SanDisk currently at $38, the collapse in flash prices has been factored into the stock price almost in full. It has also recommended that investors pile in once more, and has set a target price for the company of $55. Alongside the gallery of analysts that have downgraded SanDisk in recent months, Goldman Sachs is one important investment house which, surprisingly, has been swimming against the tide. Last week, right after the SanDisk announcement of the planned cutbacks, it decided that this would be an appropriate juncture to raise its rating for SanDisk to “Buy” from “Neutral,” with a target price of $46 for the stock. It also added it to its select “Conviction Buy List.” I did not find any new reason for Goldman’s decision to raise its rating, save for its almost volte face forecast that the company’s dramatic announcement of the cutbacks should be viewed as a clear sign that the stock can has now reached and can only gain from this point hence. For me the fact that Goldman Sachs was, and apparently still is, SanDisk’s banker speaks volumes, and despite all the talk about Chinese walls, I attach great importance to the fact that they taken this gamble, especially now with all the panic over the stock and the NAND chip market in general.

27636,20210,2007-02-21T06:32:47-05:00,,"Last Friday’s shock announcement took everyone off-guard but the real news as to the company’s future will be revealed at the upcoming analysts' conference next Monday. I originally decided not to write about SanDisk Corporation (SNDK) this week for a change, in view of the company’s upcoming analysts day next Monday, following which there will be plenty to write about. But it turns out that I was wrong, since last Friday after the bell, SanDisk issued a statement that constituted a form of warning combined with an organizational shake-up. This time, Citigroup analyst Craig Ellis was right when he and the others predicted that the NAND flash chip market would enter a state of oversupply in the first quarter of 2007, and that this would in turn, lead to a collapse in prices that would affect even advanced manufacturers such as SanDisk and Toshiba (OTCPK:TOSBF). The main cause of this is not just surplus manufacturing capacity due to the entry of new manufacturers such as Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), but also the lack of new applications to soak up the surplus supply in the second half of the year. In addition to the announced layoffs, SanDisk is also moving the sales management for all its products worldwide, save for the U.S., to Israel. This move was probably decided on in view of the vast experience that M-Systems Flash Disk Pioneers has in large-scale sales to Asian markets, as well its extensive contacts with leading handset manufacturers outside of the U.S., chiefly Nokia Corp. (NYSE:NOK), Sony/Ericsson, Taiwanese manufacturer High Tech Computer Corp. and the Korean manufacturers. The question that must be asked is why SanDisk CEO Dr. Eli Harari, who was absent from the conference call at the end of last month due to a scheduled vacation, did not wait with the announcement until next Monday’s analyst day, since he could have responded immediately to the many questions that are now being asked and which will now remain in the air for an entire week. I would like to believe that Harari’s reason for this was that he wanted to ensure a kind of distance between the two events. Last Friday’s announcement with the ton of bad news was designed on the one hand, to lower expectations, with the good news kept in store for the meeting with analysts next Monday. I believe that SanDisk will have plenty of that in store for both the second half of 2007 and the years to come. SNDK 1-yr chart   © Copyright of Globes Publisher Itonut (1983) Ltd. 2006.

24274,20454,2007-01-16T07:46:23-05:00,,"Several firms are commenting on Sandisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) this AM: - UBS expects SanDisk to meet or slightly exceed their December quarter revenue expectations for roughly $980 million (+30.4% q/q, + 30.5% y/y) and guide down hard seasonally in the range of 25% q/q. Although a string of pre-announcements and negative reports from IC vendors exposed to the wireless handset end market has us modestly concerned, the firm believes that the adoption of NAND into handsets is following its own strong secular adoption curve and that this area should drive ongoing performance despite a still weak pricing environment. The company should also benefit in 1H07 from higher royalty payments for Samsung as its MLC production increased to 70% of output in 4Q06 from 40% in 3Q06. Unfortunately for the company, industry oversupply relative to demand appears unavoidable to them into the seasonally weaker 1H07 timeframe, and they would expect ongoing weakness in NAND ASPs to weigh on sentiment when reporting season concludes. - Citigroup notes that looking back, they think SNDK had a solid 4Q06. However, looking ahead they are cautious on the shares for four reasons: 1) NAND's 1H07 fundamentals appear challenging, confirmed by Samsungs -30% 1Q07 price guidance, 2) Street 07 royalty rev ests (most NOT calculated bottoms-up) appear a stretch, 3) SNDK's new pdcts at CES impressed but appear gross margin dilutive, risking a negative target reset at the 2/26 analyst day, 4) Price elasticity of demand for traditional cards and USB drives, decelerated in 06, compounding 07 rev growth and margin risks. SanDisk is a classic second-half trade given its extensive consumer exposure, enjoying secular tailwinds in applications such as handset cards and its new ""View"" video display product. - JP Morgan notes they were encouraged by SanDisk's CES product line-up, which should fuel growth in '07. Subsequent to CES, Samsung's 4Q results and guidance underscore Sandisk's challenges, but they believe 2H07 could see a grinding recovery in margins. 2007 consensus EPS is still steep and short-term risks abound, but post 4Q earnings (01/30) SNDK stock could get interesting. Notablecalls: Nothing positive here on SNDK. Would not be surprised to see weakness in the stock heading into earnings. SNDK 1-yr chart:"

The focus was on SanDisk's warning of an oversupply of NAND flash memory chips leading to a forecast of further price declines in Q1 on top of a 17% decline q-o-q. Although sales surged 55% to $1.16b, it was its first Q4 loss since 2002 at -$35.1m, or -$0.17/share (compared to earning $133.9m, $0.68/share last year), due to costs related to its acquisition of msystems.  Q1 sales guidance of $700m - $800m was well short of analysts' average estimate of $925m. SanDisk's CEO commented, ""In the first quarter of 2007 we expect continuing robust demand for our mobile OEM products, seasonally lower retail sales, and a decline in margins due to the prevailing challenging market pricing for flash memory.""

24451,20369,2007-01-18T04:16:18-05:00,,"Who wouldn't want a piece of the next Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)?! That's the buzz with Sandisk (SNDK). Skepticism seems an appropriate response to any hype like ""the next Apple"" but it looks like this company really could make a good run at such a feat.
Sandisk is already a big success in flash storage. Flash memory is used to store pictures, songs, and other data in consumer electronic devices such as digital cameras, MP3 players, phones, video games, and other portable media products.  Sandisk isn't content with that role, however, and is aiming to take a leadership position in the next wave of portable consumer electronics including video and music players - taking direct aim at Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and many other heavyweights.  That is a tall order, but such ambition is not misplaced at Sandisk.  
There are plenty of differences that can never be repeated or even compared to Apple's unique rise, and fall, and rise again.  It is one of the most amazing brand stories, and certainly Apple's evolution from computer to consumer electronics giant is unique.  The iPod is an icon of the 21st century, propelling Apple's stock price up 3000% in the last nine years.  
Sandisk believes there is a big opportunity to grab market share away from iPod with affordable alternatives like its Sansa music player, which already has an estimated 19% share.  Last week the company made no secret of its intention to become a powerhouse in consumer electronics when it introduced its Sansa View, a music and video player with 4-inch screen and 8MB of flash storage capacity, allowing it to hold 33 hours of video or 2,000 songs.  Sandisk says it is moving from a follower in music players to a market leader in mobile video and other next-generation consumer electronics.
Sandisk is also coming out with a Wi-Fi enabled MP3 player and, a little further on the horizon, USBTV which will ease portability of digital video from computer to television. That syncs well with the recent news from Netflix to distribute movies to computers via the Internet.  Sandisk plans to price aggressively on its consumer products to speed the adoption of its new media players and products.  The company can afford to sacrifice short-term profits for long-term market leadership and says it is confident that ultimately these products will be very profitable.
Most of Sandisk's current profits come from flash memory products. Flash is one of

the most popular forms of storage in digital cameras, MP3 players, video games, and increasingly phones.  The video players add another element to the convergence in mobile electronics, and Sandisk is in position to fight with the big boys for this attractive prize.
Sandisk has blossomed since we first wrote about it in 1998, when you could buy the stock for a split-adjusted $2.25.  Now it's at $43.46.  Of course, a lot of the other numbers have grown since then, including earnings which have gone from 20 cents per share in 1999 to $2.00 in 2005 and an estimated $2.39 for the year that just ended.  2006 revenue is believed to have exceeded $3 billion and should top $4 billion in 2007.  The market cap for Sandisk now stands at $8.55 billion.  
This company has grown through acquisitions as well, swallowing up some other noteworthy names like M-Systems Flash and Matrix Semiconductor in the past year.  Earnings growth is on a trajectory of 20% per year, according to analyst estimates.  Pricing pressures have long been a concern in many segments of the chip business and flash is no exception, yet Sandisk has proven capable at staying ahead of the plunging cost/MB curve.  The company owns its own manufacturing capacity and has managed those production assets well.
Sandisk has also established a fairly well-known brand name with its removable storage cards and other products.  Moreover, the company has its products on the shelves of 200,000 stores worldwide, so distribution relationships are already in place.
It may sound like a leap to say that Sandisk could be the next powerhouse in portable consumer entertainment but this company has what it takes, starting from the inside out.  It has an impressive foothold with lower priced iPod alternatives, cost advantages with its own manufacturing of flash storage, and an intriguing lineup of next-generation gadgets.  The value of its retail distribution network is important, too.  With $2.55 billion in cash and a booming flash storage business, Sandisk is a force to be reckoned with.  Taking on the big boys like Apple and Microsoft carries big risk, but Sandisk is going after a big prize.

24076,20454,2007-01-12T07:23:12-05:00,,"Citigroup is cautious on Sandisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) shares entering 2007. Fieldwork suggests known near-term pricing risks could prove greater than Street expectations, compounded near term by seasonality, waning price elasticity of demand, and any upside to NAND supply. 
On company-specifics, while they expect solid 4Q06 EPS given handset card strength, a cautious 1Q07 outlook should be expected and they see more downside than upside risk to 2007 Street EPS revisions. Psychologically, ongoing spot and contract price declines, compounded by MU's February 9th analyst day which seems likely to emphasize 2007 supply growth and a Lexar market share gains are headwinds. 
Further out, SanDisk's 2/26 strategic and financial outlook focused analyst day could put a floor under the shares in what is otherwise a seasonally-unfriendly period until May. In summary, while the shares are not expensive at 18.6x 2007E EPS, volatility could be significant near term. Catalysts could emerge closer to the February 26th Analyst day, and the firm might reconsider their Hold rating at share prices below $40.
Increases 4Q06 EPS to $0.71 from $0.69 on handset cards+unchgd pricing. However, for the 2nd time since early-Dec, the firm cuts their 07e EPS, to $2.55 from $2.71, this time on prd pricing (prop checks) + royalty. Tgt goes to $52 from $54.

SanDisk has announced a 32GB Ultra ATA 5000 1.8-inch SSD ""drive"" (it's really flash memory). Engadget brings word that SSD prices are beginning to fall: For those not familiar with the technology, a Solid State Disk (sometimes called a Solid State Drive) is defined by Wikipedia as: Some of the benefits of SDDs include: no moving parts (which makes them practically silent), lower power consumption, super thin profile, and faster read and boot times: The problem is that SDDs aren't cheap. Sure US$600 is a lot less than US$900-1400, but keep in mind that only gets you 32GB (US$18.75 per gig.) I think that my Visa card has more memory on it than that. In comparison, a cheap 750GB 3.5-inch rotating HDD can be purchased for as low as US$330, which is 44 cents per GB. So don't expect to replace the 200GB in your MacBook Pro with an SDD anytime soon, but Moore's Law being what it is, SDDs should drop in price and increase in capacity dramatically over the next couple of years.

21424,20307,2006-11-29T10:33:09-05:00,,"Time to take profits in SanDisk (SNDK)? Merrill Lynch’s Sidney Ho asserts in a research note this morning that the memory-chip maker’s shares could extend recent weakness in the near-term, on worries about an over-supply of NAND flash memories. He says checks suggest that “flash memory demand for the holiday season so far has been seasonally normal, but no more.”
“We believe that there’s an opportunity to make money shorting SanDisk on a trading basis,” he writes. “SanDisk’s stock has already lagged both the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index [SOX] and the broader market over the past few months, but we think industry oversupply will continue to put pressure on the stock in the near term.” He expects to see “material oversupply in the first half of 2007.”
Long-term, Ho remains Neutral on the stock. “Certain suppliers, most notably Samsung, have begun to ease their capital spending on the NAND market, which should help alleviate the oversupply situation by the second half of 2007,” he writes.
SanDisk shares today are down 73 cents at $44.04."
22086,20411,2006-12-11T03:11:54-05:00,,"The fundamental issue at SanDisk (SNDK) is pricing. Their product is a commodity and unfortunately there's no way of getting around that. Wall Street is very concerned about the pricing of flash memory going forward. Recent trends suggest that flash memory is in a declining pattern and prices are expected to continue to erode through the first half of 2007. This poses some concerns for SanDisk internally that have clearly rolled over to the share price of the stock. SanDisk, for all sake and purposes, should now be considered one of the weaker stocks in the market. Although the fundamentals of SanDisk provide a basis for our decision to highlight SanDisk as the featured stock of the week this week, the fundamentals are just the first step to reaching our conclusions. After taking a closer look at the reasons for the weakness in SanDisk's share price. We will then look at the technical trading patterns of first the market and then we'll do the same for the stock itself to determine where and when we should trade SanDisk as the highlighted stock of the week this week. First let's tackle the issue of the fundamentals. Before we get too far into this analysis please remember that Wall Street always looks ahead. Wall Street develops expectations, and then Wall Street wants to see results. SanDisk, at first glance, is not an expensive stock. The PE multiple versus its recent growth rate in the October earnings release seem to suggest of the stock is trading near a level of fair value. The problem is that the recent pricing erosion in NAND flash memory has caused some concerns on Wall Street that weren't there a few quarters ago. In the last quarter flash memory pricing had eroded quite a bit more than Wall Street had been expecting. Again, flash memory is a commodity, and it fluctuates widely with supply and demand; this is par for the course for SanDisk. In the third quarter Sandisk reported NAND flash memory had declined by 25% during that quarter and the company expects additional declines of 15 to 20% in the fourth quarter. The continued price erosion in the NAND memory market exists not only the fourth quarter of 2006, but also in the first half of 2007. This has Wall Street very concerned. SanDisk has a solid business and they are a leader in their industry, but they are faced with declining margins. That's why Wall Street has trouble with the stock at this level. The simple fact of the matter is that Wall Street is concerned about future growth rates. The first half of 2007 is expected to be a very slow season. That's because of the rollouts that we've already seen in 2006. ipods MP3 players, phones which incorporate digital music, and the upcoming iPhone from Apple. All have created a significant demand for NAND memory. However, for SanDisk that demand came in 2005 and 2006. Here's an example: in the fourth quarter of 2006 Wall Street expects 130 million MP3 phones to be shipped. In addition, in January, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to roll out its iPhone. Wall Street expects 11 million iPhone's to hit the market in January. At first glance this seems like a high level of demand for NAND memory. However, we need to remember that the actual demand on the wholesale level comes prior to the retail purchase of these products. Specifically, the demand for NAND memory from SanDisk occurs prior to the sale of the actual unit. Unfortunately for SanDisk, and for the rest of the players in the flash memory market, the supply versus demand for NAND flash memory has increased to a relatively concerning level. This brings us back to economics 101. Do you remember supply and demand? The more supply, the lower the price. That's what's happening in NAND flash memory at this time. There is simply an oversupply of NAND flash memory in the market today. As a result, the prices of NAND are going down, and the margins at SanDisk are eroding. Coupled with an expected weak first-half of 2007, Wall Street has reason to be concerned about the future growth of the company. SanDisk is a leader in an industry where the market cycles are extremely volatile. Market cycles are something that we come to expect as investors, but in the case of SanDisk these market cycles are extreme. That's simply because flash memory is such a commodity. SanDisk will have its day in the sun again, but that time is not likely to be soon. We are expecting SanDisk to have a much better second half of 2007 from a fundamental perspective. The glut of NAND flash memory should work its way through the market by then and pricing power in the flash market should stabilize once it does. And once that pricing because evident Wall Street will embrace SanDisk again. From a longer-term perspective, buying SanDisk sometime in the first half of 2006 is probably the best bet for any potential buyers. Wall Street should have an indication on price stability in the NAND flash memory market. By then. So the next question is what will SanDisk do between now and then? What's going to happen to the price of the stock? I mentioned earlier in this article that the price earnings multiple of SanDisk is somewhat in line with its recent earnings growth rate. This tells us that SanDisk's business model is not likely to erode significantly. SanDisk isn't going away; however, we shouldn't expect the stock to perform well again until pricing stabilization comes in to the flash memory market.  To understand where the stock is headed we need to turn to technical analysis. Our technical analysis of SanDisk shows us that the stock had tested a level of longer-term support in the July. The natural progression tells us to expect the stock to trend higher and test resistance again after testing support. However there's a catch. When a stock like SanDisk moves from a level of longer-term support towards a level longer-term resistance it first faces an intra-channel resistance level. In order to make it all the way to an official test of longer term resistance the stock must first pass above intra-channel resistance. Unfortunately, SanDisk could not pass this intra-channel resistance level after testing support. Instead, after testing intra-channel resistance SanDisk turned lower. From a technical perspective, this was the first indication of a bearish chart pattern. The turn down from intra-channel resistance was our first indicator. The second bearish indicator in SanDisk may be coming soon. Based on our technical analysis, SanDisk is very close to breaking longer-term support. If you're looking at a chart of SanDisk at this time please understand that the longer-term support level that existed in July is different now [we have pinpointed longer term support as longer term parameter #1 in our real time trading report for SNDK.] It has been adjusted higher. In any case, if SanDisk breaks this level of longer-term support after having failed to increase beyond intra-channel resistance. A second bearish indicator will exist within the technical charts of SanDisk. Traders who are interested in SanDisk at this time should beware. If this break occurs, SanDisk will almost surely decline aggressively. In fact, the bearish chart pattern which already exists will most probably become much more bearish. So why did we choose to end this as the featured stock this week? We are expecting the market to decline from a level of midterm resistance towards a level of midterm support this week. If that happens, the weak stocks in the market will decline. SanDisk has already established itself as a weak stock relative to the rest of the market. With that and the fact that the stock is so close to breaking a level of longer-term support, we believe that if SanDisk breaks longer-term support while the market is declining that SanDisk could experience an aggressive decline this week. This is not a longer-term analysis. This recommendation is for trading purposes only. Once support levels break, like we expect in SanDisk this week, stocks usually have abrupt moves. That’s what we are expecting from SanDisk."
25656,20454,2007-01-31T10:08:51-05:00,,"Several comments on Sandisk (NASDAQ:SNDK) after the co issued strong Q4 results but dismal guidance:    - Merrill Lynch notes SanDisk delivered a solid quarter, but management's outlook was as shaky as the firm can remember. Industry oversupply in the first half of the year has limited any visibility into pricing for the year. ML has lowered their 2007E adjusted EPS estimate from $2.50 to $1.80, and our GAAP estimate from $2.10 to $0.88. Given that NAND prices still have room to fall, they see no need to upgrade SanDisk yet. As is so often the case, the stock will probably over react to intermediate-term problems despite the merits of owning it longer term. On the much lower numbers, valuation is not that compelling either. Firm's rating stands at neutral. The pricing implosion at SanDisk has negative implications for the intermediate term, but enormously positive implications for the longer term. The firm notes they wrote late last year that they expected NAND flash to be at $1 per gigabit by the end of 2007, at which point solid-state drives (NYSE:SSD) for mobile computers might start to become a reality. They are below $1 a gigabit already, and they think price could be down to $0.50 a gigabit by the end of the 2007. At that point, the prospect of $200 50GB storage devices ($0.50 x 8 x 50) becomes quite interesting. - Citigroup says that against the backdrop of weak semiconductor company 4Q06 results, SanDisk's top and bottom line strength, albeit with blemishes, surprised favorably. However, and more importantly for the shares, a slew of unexpected outlook negatives, with few offsetting positives: 1) produced dramatically lower 1Q07 revenue and EPS, 2) decreased conviction in a mid-2007 product gross margin rebound, 3) added fresh concerns about the merits of the mSystems acquisition (just closed in late-November) and 4) cast doubt on the marketing muscle behind SanDisk's own MP3 and USB retail product execution ahead of new product launches in 2Q07. Further, SNDK's own aggressive production ramp through 2007 (F3 Dec, 2006 WPM of 70k exceeded Citi's 50k estimate; capacity now targeted at 136k WPM vs. 110 previously), adds to concern about excess industry production. Overall, their new 2007 and 2008 revenues each decline by 12% while EPS estimates decline 45% and 26% respectively. Similar declines to Street estimates are likely with little compelling evidence to assert confidently that a firm bottom has been set in firm's forward estimates. They remain cautious on SNDK shares, seeing little reason to get more aggressive near-term in what is typically a (still distant) second-half play (albeit with powerful though well-known secular catalysts). A trough EPS multiple of ~16x on our 2008E estimates implies a valuation range of $35. Next week's MU analyst day seems likely to contribute to near-term share volatility, as sector supply growth concerns rekindle and as Lexar retail market share recapture concerns begin to brew. Thus, SanDisk's own February 26th analyst day may be the next potential catalyst in refurbishing now-tarnished investor confidence. Time, or the shares falling to below $35, could potentially cause the firm to reconsider their Holdrating and potentially increase interest in the shares. Target goes to $46 from $52. - Deutsche Bank maintains their cautious stance on SNDK as they believe it will continue  to prove a prudent position. Highlighting the currently treacherous NAND flash environment, SNDK declined to give any guidance on full-year ASPs, GMs, or License & Royalty stream. Given this lack of visibility it is hard to see significant buyers stepping up to the plate (unless enticed by hopes of a technical rebound). Firm lowers theirtarget price to new SoTP value of $38 and remains on the sideline until they see a material discount to this fair value (given high beta). SNDK moving away from giving bit growth and ASP guidance: They view this as negative as it significantly reduces Investors'/Analysts' ability to wrap their arms around the story. This is after all a memory company - bit growth and ASPs are key factors in modeling the business. $300m stock buy-back approved: Given the high level of dilution through stock option grants, they believe this is a step in the right direction by the company's board. However, the buy-back is not large enough to signal that the board believes stock to be significantly under-valued. - Goldman Sachs says they had hoped that the company would commit to scaling back its capacity additions, which would have allowed for NAND supply/demand dynamics to improve in 2H2007/2008. However, management appears committed to adding capacity, despite a continued very weak pricing environment. While they expect the stock to find a near-term trading floor in the upper $30/$40-range, they do not see any catalysts to drive the shares higher in the near-term in light of the company's unwillingness to scale back on capacity additions. The firm therefore recommends that only the most aggressive investors buy the stock today. That said, they continue to recommend a long SanDisk/short SPE pair trade, as they believe SanDisk is pricing in weak NAND fundamentals while the SPE stocks are not. Notablecalls: I think SNDK is headed lower in the intermediate (1-3 month) term. How much would you pay for $1.80-$2.00 EPS power in 2007? 20x? Probably less, something more closer to 16x. Luckily for the holders of common, SNDK's price to book still stands strong. I have no view on what the stock will do in the very s-t. Suspect there will be a bounce. But that's a low conviction call. SNDK 1-yr chart:"
18920,20173,2006-10-20T10:20:22-04:00,,"SanDisk Corp. (SNDK) is down 14% in pre-market, and makes a very tempting buy, but waiting is a virtue here as I expect a round of downgrades, and we will take a hard look at it if we can pick it up around $40. It seems to me people are overreacting to margins, which fell from 37% to 32% over the past year. A large part of this fall was due to the company's move to sell their own MP3 players. Their problems weren't all about the MP3s, but they intended to stuff all those expensive flash chips into them, so not only are they clogging up the warehouse, but chips they usually would have gotten out the door (had they sold them to someone else) are now sitting around as unsold inventory. They claim an 18% market share in a very slow quarter, but that 18% number will come back to haunt them if it goes down in Q4, even if earnings right themselves. But, like I have said, they are a ""volatile"" stock, and this whole thing may be a nice way to shake out the retail buyers before Q4. The analysts are focused on a ""60% drop in average selling price per megabyte."" Wow that's silly! So they can now give your much more storage for less money and people think that's bad? Better dump Intel too based on that logic, more ticks per buck over there for the past 20 years! Eli Harari [CEO] said: ""We expect to benefit in the fourth quarter from projected seasonally strong holiday sales of digital cameras, handsets, flash audio players, USB flash drives and gaming consoles and we now believe growth in our megabytes sold will be approximately 200% for 2006."" Sales were up 27% to $751M, a $14M beat. Income is .61 a share vs .57 and the big costs were R&D and marketing -- no surprise there with a new product roll-out. The real concern for the company is the ""inventory glut"" of flash memory chips, a problem that led SanDisk to start stuffing them into MP3 players in the first place. Unlike OPEC, SanDisk is dealing with their inventory surplus by lowering prices to spur demand; we'll see who is smarter next quarter. So far this year (9 months): What impacted earnings? The company also seems to have taken out too much money for taxes -- $153M vs. $148M last year, when they earned more, but I'm no accountant... So while I sympathize with people who paid 300% of last year's July selling price for this company, I am actually looking forward to picking up some of this great company at more reasonable prices.

19748,20093,2006-11-02T15:54:53-05:00,,"The explosive growth in the use of digital cameras and MP3 players combined with the demise of the floppy drive has been a boom for companies that make flash cards and Universal Serial Bus [USB] drives. Milpitas, California based SanDisk (SNDK) makes flash memory cards for digital cameras, MP3 players, the Cruzer line of USB drives and gaming cards for use in Sony's PlayStation Portable [PSP]. So what attracted me to this well known company that I felt was overvalued just a few months ago? While the stock has retreated from a high of almost $80 in January to the current $48.10, the company has released an exciting new line of MP3 players, acquired a key competitor and is well positioned to benefit from the launch of Microsoft's new operating system Windows Vista in 2007. While Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPods remain the clear leader in the MP3 market, competitors like Sandisk and Singapore based Creative Technology (OTCPK:CREAF) have been nipping at Apple's heels for years. Sandisk's Sansa line of players have been a great alternative to iPods for music lovers who use a subscription based music service like RealNetwork's (NASDAQ:RNWK) Rhapsody To Go, Yahoo Music Unlimited To Go or Napster To Go. I personally bought a couple of Sansas over the last two years and could not be happier with my player. However, no player on the market has managed to capture the ""cool factor"" that has propelled the iPods to their status as a market leader. Until now. With the release of the sleek and highly attractive e200 series of MP3 players, Sandisk stands a good chance capture market share in this highly profitable and competitive segment this holiday season. Beyond MP3 players, SanDisk also stands to benefit from other emerging areas of growth. Samsung unveiled a 32GB flash-disk based laptop earlier this year, which has distinct advantages over hard drives but remains prohibitively expensive. While the possibility of flash based laptops is a few years out, hybrid hard drives [HDD] that combine a regular hard drive with a 1 GB flash chip to improve performance and conserve power are right around the corner with the release of Windows Vista. Instead of a hybrid hard drive, Windows Vista users can also use a feature called ReadyBoost that can improve the performance of the system by attaching an external flash memory device like a USB Key. The ability to increase the memory of a computer without having to open it up and adding more RAM will certainly appeal to many users and is likely to increase the sales of large USB key drives. Sandisk has been attempting to increase market share by significantly dropping prices on its USB Key drives and the flash chips it supplies to computer manufacturers. This quest for market share along with increased R&D costs has indeed caused a drop in margins, clearly spooking Wall Street in the process and leading to a drop of $12.58 a share or more than 20% on October 20th after Sandisk reported third quarter results. While income dropped 4% to $103.3 million from $107.4 million, revenue actually increased a healthy 27% to $1.85 billion, providing the perfect opportunity to get into this growth stock in a moment of weakness. With a solid balance sheet and a forward P/E of 17.24, SanDisk could prove to be an attractive long-term investment. Competitors: SanDisk faces stiff competition from Samsung, Hynix, Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the flash memory segment as well as Creative Technology (OTCPK:CREAF) and Apple (OTC:APPL) in the MP3 segment.

18529,20307,2006-10-16T15:17:52-04:00,,"Daniel Amir, an analyst at W.R. Hambrecht, says that the third quarter earnings report from SanDisk (SNDK) this Thursday will likely be way above the Street consensus. 
He raised his revenue estimate for the quarter to $752 million from $721 million, while increasing per share profits to 62 cents a share from 55 cents, reflecting higher-than-expected bit growth and much higher than forecast gross margins due to above-plan yields at the company’s Fab 3 chip plant.
The Street is looking for $735 million and 56 cents for the quarter.
The analyst says the company is seeing “strength in the mobile handset and MP3 player markets.”
Amir boosted his 2006 profit forecast to $2.51 a share, from $2.33; for 2007 he went to $2.80 a share, from $2.65.
SanDisk shares today are up $2.41 to $61.57."

15774,20186,2006-08-21T09:12:00-04:00,,"Rob Zenilman submits: In today's Wall Street Journal, Nick Wingfield's SanDisk Raises Music-Player Stakes discusses the latest in the battle of the MP3 players. SanDisk (SNDK) delivered the the most recent salvo by announcing the Sansa e280, an MP3 player with 8GB of flash memory (i.e., no hard disk!). The e280 is priced at $249.99, the same price Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) charges for its 4GB Nanao. Sandisk also announced 30% price cuts on its other players, and outlined plans for a sub $100 player. In the second quarter, SanDisk's market share grew to 9.7%, up from 3.1% in Q2 2005. Still trailing Apple's market dominating 75.6% share (Q2 2006), SanDisk's increased market share is at the expense of Creative (OTCPK:CREAF), Samsung and Sony (NYSE:SNE). SanDisk also enjoys lower component costs than its rivals, since it manufactures its own flash memory. Comment:  Aside from growing its consumer electronics business, SanDisk's recent acquisition of M-Systems (FLSH) shows they are focused on strengthening their core component business as well. Apple's iPod is still the 800 pound gorilla in the MP3 player market, but as that market gets saturated and commoditized, they will switch their focus to video.

The company that operates primarily in the financial payments industry. While most people may have never heard of the company, those that have just believe it's a fuel management company for large corporate fleets. The truth, however is that WEX actually operates in 200 countries and processes payments for various transactions outside of vehicle maintenance. The company has been working to diversify and capture more customer spend by offering solutions for a multitude of corporate expenditures. The company owns and operates its own payments network which is extremely attractive as it reduces costs and reliance on traditional names. Recent earnings reports show the company is still performing well and should continue to do so. Despite this, the shares have pulled back and offer value given growth prospects.For investors not familiar with how WEX works, the slide below gives a clear explanation.The company manages financial transactions for medium to large sized businesses that cannot possibly oversee all financial transaction and detect fraud.Source: WexThe company has several divisions that provide a diverse stream of revenue.Source: Investor DeckThe fleet division is responsible for payments in relation to company owned and employee operated vehicles. Beyond fuel, this also includes repairs and maintenance. Travel handles corporate bookings and other items but the company drives revenue primarily from the use of its cards. Similar to a payments processor like Visa (V) or MasterCard (MA). The fast growing health and employee benefits division offers several services. This division is experiencing great growth as Wex cross-sells its current customer base from the other divisions.Taking a look below we can see a better break down of each division and how it operates.Source: Investor DeckThe fleet solutions itself sees diverse revenue streams. This will be impacted by the current economic situation quite significantly. However, it will rebound just as strong when the country reopens for business.Below we can see the opportunity the company has identified in the travel space.Source: Investor DeckThis is why the company has such strong prospects going forward. It commands a leading position yet only actually has quite a small percentage of the market currently. By my estimates it has 4% of the total market size which is constantly growing. If the company can grow this division 1% a year to 10%, it has 6 years of runway growth ahead adding $100 million per year or more in revenue.Source: Investor DeckThe company stands to benefit the same as any other processor. A fee on the transaction and it's that simple.The fastest growing division is the health solutions division.Source: Investor DeckThe company is growing faster than the market is currently, but once it slows down it should be able to match the market pace. Presuming health spending continues to grow as it always has, the company should grow alongside it.WEX reported fourth quarter results that were excellent to say the least.Source: Seeking AlphaThe company continued to grow revenue at an impressive pace, with sales rising 15.4% to $440 million. This was despite an $8.7 million negative impact due to lower fuel prices. This is expected to be a serious headwind in the coming quarters as the fuel prices across the country have seen a large drop. The company is unable to quantify what effect the recent Covid-19 outbreak will have on guidance.Thanks to the conversion of large customers and the portfolios of Shell and Chevron being taken over, the company now manages fuel payment solutions for 14.9 million vehicles. This is 19% higher than the year before. This is evidently benefiting the company is a positive manner as we can see a better picture of the results below.Source: Earnings SlidesFurthermore the company is building stronger relationships with these brands and its customers by offering new technology such as Driver Dash. This is the first app to hit the market that will allow fleet users to authorize a transaction using a mobile device and not have to carry a card. This technology is brilliant as it can be used across the various divisions the company has been working to grow. One of them, healthcare, is seeing huge growth.For the full year the company grew revenue on a similar trajectory and earnings at quite a healthy pace as well.Source: Earnings SlidesI find it quite impressive the level of growth the company reports and yet how it is barely recognized. This level of growth is usually applauded by a huge premium valuation by most investors.The company broke down where revenue growth was being driven from by each of its operating divisions.Source: Earnings SlidesThe company saw 69% revenue growth in its health solutions division. This should continue to accelerate and become a larger part of the company as it continues to win and serve more corporate customers. The benefit for its customers is that it becomes a one stop shop for their employee's payment needs. Additionally, the travel and corporate solutions division saw impressive growth of 22.7%. This kind of growth should really be applauded.The company operates as a payments provider for the employee who may have a health savings account, flexible spending account, or health reimbursement account.Source: Investor PresentationThe company is committed to grow in the category by continued acquisitions and should continue to see beneficial revenue growth as it wins more of its existing customer base over. Additionally, it gives the sales team an easier way to capture new customers as a broader offering of business solutions makes the company an easy choice.In the ever growing age of data, the company is able to provide a clearer picture on a per employee basis of spending habits and other data. This allows WEX customers to make better decisions for themselves as they see how its employees are affecting them financially. These type of tools are irreplaceable and create a very sticky customer.The company continues to believe in its own story and gave strong guidance for the year 2020 before recent events. For the full year 2020, WEX expected revenue to be in the range of $1,860 million to $1,900 million and adjusted net income in the range of $447 million to $464 million. This should have provided earnings per share of approximately $10.15 to $10.55. This is however not going to be the case any longer. Taking a guess, if we see earnings drop 30% for the full year because of recent events, we could still see $7 per share in earnings for 2020. This is before a rapid acceleration in 2021 with earnings going back to a more normalized pace. The company primarily services large corporate clients that should largely remain in business.Looking at the balance sheet, we can see the company has enough cash on hand to weather a storm.Source: Earnings SlidesThe company has $811 million in cash and $2.78 billion in debt. There also stood up to $769 million in available borrowing capacity should the company need.This pure profit part of the business could negatively impact earnings growth in the coming quarters, but I also expect a growing cash balance to make up for any decline in rates for now.WEX is a hard company to value. I typically look to invest in companies with dividends and clear competitors to compare against. However, WEX is really the industry leader and no competitor offers similar solutions on such a broad basis across their own network. In fact, I believe because WEX owns its own network this makes it more valuable. This not only helps improve margins, but insulates it from competitors and price wars as it has a lower cost basis and the capability to add more services to its network. It could be easy to see the company one day offering pay cards for employees who prefer to be paid on a debit card instead of their bank account.Looking at historical valuation, we can see where shares trade compared to their own average.Source: MorningstarWhile results may be temporarily skewed and thus these valuation metrics may be as well, it is important to remember we expect a recovery in earnings.From what we can see, the company trades at a lower forward P/E, P/S, P/CF, and P/B ratio than it typically has. However, the P/E and P/S can be affected by things such as negative fuel prices or a weak job market. The company makes more on both a higher number of covered employees and higher fuel prices. For the future quarter the company already has set expectations for fuel to be around $2.70 a gallon, so the recent drop in prices was not yet calculated in expected in earnings.WEX is an interesting play. I recently added more shares to my portfolio and believe it will continue to benefit from the path it has taken to grow. With continued acquisitions, customer wins, expanded service offerings, and execution, the company should continue to grow at an impressive pace for quite some time. I find it trading at an attractive valuation given others players and valuations in the payment processing space. While the company deserves a discount due to its revenue being dependent upon strong corporate growth and stable fuel prices, it is working hard to diversify its income. The company has proven it can win business and grow quarter after quarter as well. With recently reported results and guidance showing no slow down, the company didn't deserve the recent 60% price drop. Investors may do well to take a deeper look at the company for their portfolios. I may continue to add from here should it pull back any further."

(WEX) is a global payment solutions & accounts processing company that services businesses across three verticals - commercial & government fleet fuel cards, corporate & travel solutions, and health and employee benefits.Over the last decade, WEX has been able to demonstrate impressive levels of growth at the revenue and operating level, by exploiting the high demand for their services in payment processing & transaction processing, and augmenting that with significant operating leverage. However, the recent health pandemic has thrown a spanner in the works of the company's revenue model, particularly in fleet solutions and travel solutions. Fuel price movement has weighed heavily on WEX's revenue as c.21% of their group revenue comes from fees received from fuel providers based on the negotiated % of the purchase price of fuel bought. On account of stay-at-home orders and lower traffic on the road, fuel prices had gone for a toss this year. Already, in 2019, the average fuel price per gallon was down 5% at $2.8. In 2020, it then came off significantly, falling to as low as $1.9271 in April (if you want some context on how this impacts them do note that every 1c decline in the average domestic fuel price impacts their revenue by $1.6m).Fuel prices are currently trading higher by about 25-30c from the April lows as vehicle traffic has picked up, but elevated coronavirus cases in some of the key fuel-guzzling states of California, Florida, and Texas are threatening to keep a near-term lid on fuel prices. On the earnings call last week, the management mentioned that whilst there was an improvement in areas such as construction, the key retail and service-related areas that rely on fleet were still experiencing weakness. Compared to a year-ago period, average fuel prices in July are down by 60c. Yes, there will be a lot of ebb and flow from now until the rest of the year, but if one were to extrapolate this, you're basically looking at almost a $100m hit on revenue due to lower fuel prices in 2020 or in other words, about c.7% of last year's annual revenue.The other point worth noting is that most of WEX's clients are small and mid-sized fleet businesses. As mentioned recently on the Lead-Lag report, I think these businesses are skating on thin ice when it comes to their liquidity, and WEX might have to contend with some collection issues going forward. In fact, to prepare for this, in the Q2 earnings, they bumped up their provision for credit losses by 39%. Just thinking about this structurally, even in the normal course of business, I do feel they expose themselves to considerable credit risk as they tend to fund the entire receivable of a customer, whilst only generating a small % of that amount as revenue. In good times this works, but during a bad credit environment, this can be a huge risk.As you can imagine, with global travel coming to a halt, their travel and corporate payments business too remains badly affected. Global travel spend was down 90% in April and has still not quite picked up, down 81% in July. Spend volumes too are down 65% in July, not much of an improvement from 70% in April. Overall revenue from the travel & corporate business was down a whopping 40% in Q2.The prospects on WEX's third segment - the Health and employee benefits business (c.25% of group revenue) - looks somewhat better. Revenue was up +6% in Q2 and spend volumes should continue to improve in 2020 as more elective healthcare procedures come back. Their SaaS offering within health too has remained quite resilient during this year and is expected to grow at mid-to-high teens in Q3 and beyond.Source: WEXTo fuel its growth ambitions and its acquisition spree, WEX has built up significant leverage on its balance sheet and, at the end of last year, was almost 3x the debt amount seen in 2015 at around $3 billion.Source: Prepared by the author using data from Seeking AlphaThat said, I've been enthused by their cash-generating efforts in H1-20 that has led to a significant decrease in the net debt by over $700 million. This was primarily driven by improved collection efforts on the accounts receivable front (accounts receivables were down 27% YoY) which was a significant source of cash inflow and helped mitigate the weak net income performance. Ongoing measures such as these will be needed more so considering the headwinds around the topline and EBITDA growth (although as I've mentioned above, their exposure to small and medium businesses might begin to cause some credit risk going forward)Source: WEXBesides there is one additional factor that could cause disrupt the leverage issue - the ongoing litigation related to the potential acquisition of eNett and Optal. In Jan, WEX had announced a $1.7 billion deal (that involved $1.275 billion of cash) to acquire eNett, Optal, and Travelport's business but reneged on this in May by calling the deal off on account of the pandemic (on grounds of Material Adverse Effect). There is a lot of uncertainty around how this will fructify and a trial of preliminary issues is due at the end of September. If WEX is unsuccessful in winning the case, you can imagine what sort of impact a $1.7 billion deal could have on its leverage, more so in this uncertain environment. Watch this space!On the charts, things are currently looking fairly neutral with a few warning signs cropping up. Over the long term, the stock has been trending upwards via an ascending wedge pattern. Recently, during the sell-off in March, it respected the lower boundary of the wedge at around the $100 levels and has since recovered towards the middle of this broad wedge. On the daily chart, the stock has been attempting to clear the 200DMA since early June but despite three to four attempts over the last two months, has not been successful in doing so. Even if it does clear it, as the stock gets close to the price point of $200, it may likely face resistance given the psychological importance of that number and also that it coincides with the peak of the left shoulder of a potential head-and-shoulders pattern. It isn't a classic head-and-shoulders pattern but the risk does exist if it is unable to break past $200 significantly.The other issue that bothers me is that one has only witnessed insider selling in the recent past; I have not seen any insider buying in the stock for a few years now. As you can see from the table below, significant C-suite members including the CFO and CEO have been selling the stock this year. The CFO, in particular, has been quite rampant over the last three months, selling shares for more than $3.3 million, with almost two-thirds of the sales taking place just a few days back.Source: GurufocusThings are also not helped by the fact that current stock valuations are not particularly competitive, especially when you consider the historic average. As per data from Seeking Alpha, the stock currently trades at an exorbitant forward P/E multiple of almost 60x, which represents a 45% premium over the 5-year forward P/E multiple of this stock. As I've highlighted above, until this year, WEX had some very good growth credentials and this has been reflected in a 5-year average forward PEG ratio of above 1 at around 1.4. Currently, the stock trades at a forward PEG ratio of 1.64x, a 17% premium to its historical average. Given the somewhat unsteady growth prospects that it is currently dealing with, I'm not sure this current premium is warranted.WEX is a traditionally strong growth-player that is currently facing some stumbling blocks on account of the macroeconomic environment. Whilst the situation has improved since April, headwinds related to fuel prices and small businesses' credit risk persist. The healthcare business may ease some of the ongoing strain. I've been encouraged by their deleveraging initiatives in H1, but the legal uncertainty around prospective acquisitions (resolution only by late September) could cause leverage to spike again. On the charts, things are fairly neutral, with a negative bias. This is augmented by relentless insider selling and steep valuations across key metrics.Like this article?

For the full year 2019, WEX expects revenue to be between $1.720 billion to $1.750 billion and adjusted net income in the range of $399 million to $410 million. This should provide earnings per share of approximately $9.10 to $9.35. This represents growth of about 11% over 2018 earnings.

However, this can be affected by things such as negative fuel prices or a weak job market. The company makes more on both a higher number of covered employees and higher fuel prices. For the future quarter the company already has set expectations for fuel to be around $2.72 a gallon, so the recent drop in prices was already expected in results. This is a positive as we shouldn't see a negative surprise unless oil keeps falling. The forward P/S ratio also seems to be trending below average which may imply value at this time.Lastly, the company benefits from a healthy balance sheet.Source: Earnings SlidesWhile the leverage ratio may seem high, the company has most of its debt at fixed rates and also has plenty of cash available for decent sized acquisitions. It also has access to $720 million on a credit line.

3859516,86786,2016-02-03T07:54:42-05:00,Wex's growth rate is concerning in light of the bloated stock.An excess returns model shows a large opportunity cost to investing in Wex.Investors should aim to buy a deep dip when the stock is more fairly valued.,"Wex Inc. (NYSE:WEX) has fallen 21% in the past month. I was asked to look into this company by a Seeking Alpha reader of my article on Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF), who asked for a similar analysis on this payment processor.This is a welcome addition to the articles on Seeking Alpha, as most of the articles dip into Wex's business model, ignoring the financials. Wex is not a new company - with 10 years of financial data, we should be able to see some trends and gauge its health. This is what I plan to do in this article.Invested capital outpacing free cash flow should be concerningWex has seen a surge in invested capital that has come with the growth of its business. Yet, free cash flow has bounced all over. As a running average, free cash flow is negative:The comparison between free cash flow and invested capital gives us a good indication of the business's growth:The ratio of free cash flow to invested capital gives us the capital return on invested capital (CROIC). Because FCF varies so wildly per year, we benefit by using the running average instead. This gives us a measurement of Wex's growth rate:Though the stock has increased sharply over the years, the growth rate does not support this. The low/negative growth rate and free cash flow lead to the inability to intrinsically value Wex via discounted cash flow. Luckily, we have many other tricks to check if the stock is in line with the financial data.A recent study tried to tie financials to future stock price movements and found the EBITDA/EV ratio correlated to stock price changes. Yet, the trend in EBITDA/EV in comparison to the stock price trend has not converged. In fact, even recently, with the dip in Wex, these two ratios have moved in opposite directions:Often, in these kinds of analyses, I find the stock price trailing the fundamentals. But this is a rare case where the stock price seems to be leading the fundamentals. Because that is impossible, the only conclusion at this point is that the price is fueled solely by sentiment, at least looking at these ratios.When I look at the financials for Wex, things look better, but still bad. For example, the rolling average of earnings is up, showing that its business model is working in expanding the company:But if WEX is moving independent from the financials, we should not care too much about the fundamentals. You probably disagree - and so do I. Thus, we should keep digging to find fundamentals that are actually predicative of stock price movement.ValuationIt is in the valuation that we see some fundamentals in line with the stock. In using the excess returns model, which you can read about here, here, and here, we find the growth of the stock to mimic the growth of the implicit valuation as per the company's excess returns - how the company's return on equity exceeds the industry's. Both have headed upward in tandem, except for the dip in 2009, in which they both moved downward:Thus, the trend of the excess returns valuation can likely predict the trend in the stock price of Wex. However, the intrinsic valuation has always been under the stock price. The conclusion is that sentiment and expectations are priced in.The dip in the stock should be seen as a correction. The ERM valuation accounts for opportunity cost, and the fact that it's 50% of the stock implies that investors would be better off investing their money in other companies or vehicles. Wex might have a bright future ahead, but at these price levels, it's overpriced.Even the liquidation model, which gives a lower limit based on liquidating the company and paying the sold assets to the shareholder, shows Wex to be grossly overpriced. Shareholder equity is at roughly 25%, meaning shareholders would gain 25% of the assets in the case of liquidation:A quick calculation sets the lower limit of the stock (ignoring excess returns and speculations) to be $27.26. Could sentiment plus excess returns triple the market price? Or, using the excess returns model, could sentiment alone double the market price of WEX?If you think the company's fundamentals will be doubly good in a year, sure. But looking at the growth rate and free cash flow, this is unreasonable. With nothing especially interesting in Wex's future, speculation and sentiment should not double or triple the price of the stock.Most of the company's business endeavors, such as its acquisition of Evolution1, have likely been priced into the stock. But the oil prices, which directly affect Wex's bottom line, haven't seemed to affect the stock - unless that's the dip we are currently seeing. My theory is that investors' beer goggles are disappearing, allowing them to see the company for the fundamentals that it's based on.If this is the case, the stock price of Wex should continue to drop to a fairer value, at least 1.5x the price of the ERM model - which is a generous estimate, in my opinion. Perhaps Wex will continue to grow, and it will almost certainly see a bounce as oil returns. However, now is not the time to buy.The stock is overpriced. Buy the dip when the dip is deep enough. Aim for a buy price of around $52.Request a Statistical StudyIf you would like for me to run a statistical study on a specific aspect of a specific stock, commodity, or market, just request so in the comments section below.

(WEX) is trading at a significant discount to its fleet card peer FleetCor Tech. (NYSE:FLT) and there is a growing discussion about the opportunity for the company to catch up or even command a premium over peers, but looking at the fundamentals, the possibility looks rather remote. Indeed, on the contrary, with a relatively weaker balance sheet that may make further acquisitions difficult, and weak fuel prices, the absence of an equally strong fee income and uncertainty born out of the recent EFS (Electronic Funds Source) acquisition, the challenges for WEX seem high, making it difficult for the name to close the 'best of breed' premium currently enjoyed by FleetCor.From a macro industry standpoint, one can argue that some of the tailwinds enjoyed by most players in the space seem to be easing out. The fuel prices are weak again, which may lead to fuel price volatility and lower earnings visibility, and the trucking industry that was benefiting from an economic comeback post-financial crisis may also find it difficult to maintain the current momentum. The digitalization of fleet monitoring, fuel-buying decisions, sending cash advances to drivers and other transactions needed for fleet management continues to gain acceptance, just as questions over the relevance about the fleet cards are starting to find a voice.Oil impactGiven fuel-card firms get a cut on sales when customers swipe their cards at the pump, an inflationary environment is a favorable development in general. Fuel card firms generate revenue from their payments network and card processing services for fleets, charging fleet operators for the fuel cards and fees from gasoline companies that take the fuel cards. Since wholesale prices, compared to retail prices, move faster to align with oil prices, there exists a spread between the wholesale price of fuel and the retail price. The heightened volatility may allow the business to benefit from the price spreads in the short-term, but over a longer period, lower prices may only shrink the spread. Indeed, on a full year basis, a 10 cents change in average domestic fuel prices is expected to increase or decrease revenue by approximately $12 million for the company. Worth noting that most of the company's fuel hedges expired in the first quarter and the company, till the end of last quarter, was waiting for further price increases to go for hedges.Growing uncertaintyNo doubt, the EFS acquisition should help WEX improve its OTR (Over the Road) platform capabilities, including fuel price analytics, mobile account maintenance, etc., the virtual business EFS's electronic accounts payable offering and help diversify some of the fuel price sensitivity, but the process of integrating a business of such scale is bound to occupy management's time and create uncertainty for investors.The softness in same store sales, which was down 4% in the most recent quarter after a weak performance during the first quarter, is visible and the weakness in large fleets and the oil and gas industry is continuing. The Travel & Corp. business, almost 23% of the total revenue and a major growth driver, may face increasing pressure as the business expands globally, especially from non-bank models in serving smaller travel providers.The balance sheet may allow limited room for making acquisitions in the near future, given the leverage of close to 4.7 times and the company's goal of close to 2-3 times. As for using stock as a currency for acquisitions, other players in the broader payment processing space, i.e. players like Vantiv (VNTV), Alliance Data (NYSE:ADS), Global Payments (NYSE:GPN), MasterCard (NYSE:MA) and Visa (NYSE:V), may have an advantage, at least looking at the valuation."

The company has a long history of providing customers with fleet vehicle payment processing services specifically designed for the needs of commercial and government fleets. Over the past ten years (2005-14), WEX grew this segment by around 9.5% annually to more than $500 million in annual revenue. Operating margins were more than 40% in the good years, as WEX enjoyed the benefits of high incremental margins on additional transactions. In recent years, WEX has diversified geographically into Australia, Latin America, and more recently Europe. Additionally, the company has entered new verticals in recent years, offering payment solutions for the travel and healthcare industries. 2015 has been a very significant year of investment for WEX, which has been a drag on earnings. WEX is also impacted by the extreme selloff in gasoline prices in the U.S. as it normally receives a percentage of the fleet fuel purchases. However, as we look towards 2016, gasoline prices may continue to be a significant headwind, but I expect we will see positive contributions from WEX's recent acquisitions and spending initiatives. In today's economic environment, I believe investors will appreciate the improving fundamentals for WEX as we progress through 2016.The core business of fleet vehicle payment processing services.WEX has over 9.7 million fleet cards issued to a customer base of more than 300,000. The federal government is WEX's largest customer, but WEX's largest market share is among small fleets. WEX estimates it has a 16% share of the 41 million commercial vehicles domestically. Other major competitors include Comdata, a division of FleetCor Technologies (NYSE:FLT), and to a lesser extent, Voyager, a division of U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB). Broadly speaking, the fleet card providers compete against other credit cards and cash, but WEX and others provide their customers with a higher level of security, purchase control, and reporting solutions. Like other card issuers, WEX extends short-term credit to the fleet customers and pays the purchase price for the fleet customer's transaction, less the payment processing fees retained, to the merchant. After rebates to the customer, WEX normally retains around 135-140 basis points in the form of payment processing fees, while total revenue can exceed 2% of transaction volumes after adding in transaction processing revenue, account servicing revenue, finance fees, and other miscellaneous fees. In good times, the incremental costs of additional volumes can be limited to the interest charges to fund the receivables and an uptick in the provision for credit losses, which have run at a modest rate of about 10 basis points in recent quarters. Over time, WEX does need to add people and technology to support the business, but this division is an attractive business in my opinion.On the flip side, 2015 has proven to be somewhat challenging with regards to the dramatic slide we have seen in gasoline prices. Through the third quarter, WEX reported average domestic gasoline prices of $2.64 per gallon, down 28% from a $3.67 average a year ago. Year to date, through the third quarter, WEX has seen a 15% reduction in fuel-related payment processing revenue, but only a 5% reduction in total revenue as finance and account servicing fees are up nicely. In late-2014, WEX entered into a majority-owned (75%) partnership with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) for its European commercial fuel card program. WEX spent nearly $380 million on the venture and expects to get back to breakeven sometime in 2016 after losing an expected $10+ million after tax in 2015. WEX also engages in gasoline price-hedging strategies from time to time when prices are relatively high. The current hedging program winds down in 2016Q1, and WEX will be facing an estimated $40 million headwind in pre-tax profits next year given that no hedges are currently in place beyond the first quarter. In mid-October, WEX announced a very sizable acquisition of Electronic Funds Source LLC (EFS), a leader in the market for over-the-road (NYSE:OTR) fleet cards (i.e. semi-truck drivers). WEX expects the transaction to close in April of 2016 and indicated on its last quarterly conference call that EFS has an adjusted 2015 run-rate EBITDA of around $90 million and that WEX hopes to realize $25 million in synergies over three years. EFS sales were not disclosed as part of the transaction, but based on other transactions, I estimate EFS has annual revenue of perhaps $250-300 million. WEX already has a presence in the OTR market with its $376 million purchase of Fleet One in October 2012. Given that WEX has an existing network platform and IT infrastructure, I am optimistic that $25 million in synergies can be realized much faster than three years and that there is upside to the combined EBITDA margins. In summary, there are and will be many moving parts to WEX's fleet payment processing business in 2016. I believe it is reasonable to think that continued improvement in contribution from the European venture, combined with a possible $0.25 EPS contribution from the EFS acquisition (expected to close in April) will nearly offset the lack of hedging gains seen in 2015. Beyond next year, I would expect continued organic growth in the range of 3-7%, with potential upside from new opportunities in Europe and further penetration of the domestic OTR market. Beyond 2016, I see the potential for continued, steady growth with an eye on operating margins getting back to the mid-30s percent range. On these seemingly modest assumptions, I believe WEX's fleet payment solutions business can grow for the next few years at the company's targeted long-term growth rate of 15-20%, which WEX defines as adjusted net income.Source: Investor PresentationOther Payment Solutions-A Focus on Travel and HealthcareBeyond the fleet payment solutions business, WEX provides payment processing solutions to the travel and healthcare industries. These two verticals contribute about one-third of total revenue. Within travel, WEX is partnered with four of the five largest online travel companies such as Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN) and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) to provide payment processing services for their hotel merchant transactions. Interchange rates (WEX's share of the transaction) have averaged just north of 80 basis points, which compares to the 130-140 basis points on the fleet side.Source: Investor PresentationWEX is the largest provider domestically of single-use virtual card payments between the online travel agents and the hotel room suppliers. The single-use card helps eliminate potential fraud and misuse from the travel agent's perspective and provides the hotels with timely fund transfers, automated reconciliation, and cost savings. Purchase volume in this segment grew by 18% in the most recent quarter according to company filings, and WEX is looking to make this a global business, with continued expansion throughout Europe, Brazil, and select countries in Asia. Operating margins historically have been lower in this segment (low 30's) vs. the fleet operations business, given a higher level of customer rebates, but the revenue outlook remains robust, and I am optimistic that this segment also can grow at the company's targeted 15-20% rate for the next few years.Within health, WEX has made significant acquisitions in the last two years to gain an estimated 10% share on what the company considers to be a $1.1 billion market today for consumer-directed healthcare. In July 2014, WEX acquired Evolution1 for more than $500 million. Evolution1's software serves third-party administrators, financial institutions, health plans, and other software providers, providing reimbursement services to more than 100,000 employers and more than 11 million consumers. The company generates revenue both from monthly fees and from interchange rates when healthcare dollars are spent by the consumers. More recently, WEX acquired Benaissance for around $80 million, which is another software provider with solutions for healthcare premium billing as well as payments. Benaissance is particularly strong in the area of assisting with COBRA health insurance. Collectively, WEX has expanded its current addressable market to more than $1.5 billion. As with the fleet payment processing business, I expect there to be significant margin opportunity over the next couple of years as the recent acquisitions are integrated, and the company continues to gain market share and expand into new markets domestically and internationally. It remains to be seen how the U.S. healthcare system will evolve, but WEX is well positioned for the inevitable push towards more consumer-driven healthcare choices vs. employer involvement. It's difficult for me to forecast how WEX's healthcare business will evolve from today's offering, but if the firm can execute with its recent acquisitions, 15-20% growth from this segment also seems quite plausible.I am looking for the stock to double over the next 4-5 yearsWEX management is forecasting adjusted net EPS of between $4.74 and $4.81 for calendar 2015. However, this forecast was made at the time of the third quarter earnings call in late October, and management was expecting a fourth quarter average gasoline price of $2.39 per gallon. Instead, I suspect the fourth quarter gasoline prices will be closer to $2.20 per gallon, or perhaps a bit lower depending on how the calculation is made. I estimate a $0.20 negative swing in gas prices in the fourth quarter will impact forecasted revenue by about $4.5 million. WEX is hedged on roughly 40% of its gasoline exposure for the fourth quarter which will help offset the downward price movement, but I suspect the net negative impact could still approach a $0.03-0.04 hit to fourth quarter EPS. The bigger risk is that management changes its forecast for a spring rebound in gasoline and takes a much more conservative stance towards the outlook for 2016 gasoline prices. Admittedly, with current gasoline prices at around $2.00 per gallon, it feels like there will be tough comparisons for the first nine months of 2016 (against an estimated $2.48 average for calendar 2015). However, beyond the short-term fluctuations in gasoline prices, my work has led me to have a fairly high degree of confidence that WEX is well positioned to achieve its long-term annual revenue growth targets of 10-15% and adjusted net income growth of between 15-20%. In building a five year forecast, I'm comfortable predicting that gasoline prices will be higher in the out years than they are today. The European venture with XOM should begin to contribute significant profits in the coming quarters and provides upside leverage if gasoline prices do move higher. The EFS acquisition can contribute $0.25 to EPS next year and even more in the following year given the potential synergies and full-year contribution. The travel business should continue to grow at a robust rate as the platform expands geographically. Lastly, the healthcare comparisons should also get easier, as I believe Evolution1's margins are poised to move significantly higher. Assuming a high teens multiple on cash earnings of around $10 per share 4-5 years from now should provide investors with a potential double in the stock price from current levels. Risks to the story include the short-term effects of low gasoline prices and the winding down of the company's hedging program in the first quarter of 2016, where about 20% of the fuel exposure is hedged. If OPEC is intent on further destroying oil prices, we could be shocked at how low gasoline prices might fall, even from today's levels. Secondly, WEX has made a tremendous number of acquisitions in recent years, taking on more debt that it ideally would like. However, the payments processing business is not particularly capital intensive and has the potential to generate very healthy levels of free cash flow. WEX's technology acquisitions can stand on their own, and WEX has the ability to integrate them on their own timeline. There's also probably more risk to the Evolution1 acquisition than the much-larger EFS acquisition or the XOM venture given that it is a relatively new market for WEX. In an uncertain economic environment, I am attracted to the relative stability of the payments processing business, the growth opportunities, and the significant margin opportunity WEX has in front of it given today's depressed margins and the potential contribution from all of the acquisitions.Interestingly, tonight is the deadline for Seeking Alpha's Top Long Idea for 2016 contest. As much as I would like to add this idea to the list of contenders, I think it would take an unusual set of circumstances in the market for this to be a huge relative winner in 2016. A surge in gasoline prices would have the most impact to a higher stock price in 2016, but other stocks with more direct commodity exposure would do better if that were to occur. So while I don't think WEX will win any stock of the year contests, I am confident that it has the potential to perform much better than the market (and several stock of the year candidates) over the next 4-5 years."
3246016,24361,2015-06-10T09:19:36-04:00,"WEX has been gaining share in the U.S. fleet market and has an opportunity to not only gain further share but increase its per-transaction revenue and gain share abroad.WEX has done well in the travel business with its virtual payment business, but healthcare has been slower to develop and management must execute on the Evolution 1 acquisition.EV/EBITDA can support a fair value in the neighborhood of $115, but WEX has to deliver double-digit revenue growth for an extended period of time to justify the valuation.","Figuring out the right price for growth is equal parts art, science, and voodoo and as close to a sure way to stir up comments as anything. If you're a momentum investor that doesn't care about the price you're paying for growth, WEX (NYSE:WEX) could have a lot to offer, as I do believe this payment process company still has a meaningful opportunity to gain share in its core U.S. fleet operations, to say nothing of the substantial opportunities in Europe, Asia, and Latin America and in other verticals like travel and healthcare.For my part, though, I can't just buy a stock and trust that the growth will be there. Even with what I think are pretty bullish assumptions about future revenues and FCF generation (as well as ROE and EBITDA), about the best I can do is say that the growth opportunity here is reasonably priced. ""Reasonably priced"" with ample upside isn't a bad setup for a growth story, but I do expect these shares to be more volatile than normal.The U.S. Can Do Better, And The Rest Of The World Can Get BiggerFor so long as fleet card processing represents the lion's share of WEX's business, I expect that near-term share price performance will continue to be influenced by gasoline and diesel prices. Even so, I think the underlying performance has been positive. While reported fleet revenue was up 5% in the first quarter, transaction volume was up 12% after growing about 9% in the fourth quarter.Depending upon how you define the market, WEX has a mid-teens share of the U.S. market and a substantial portion of the market (around 40%) still uses cash to pay for fuel. I expect the available market to continue to grow (WEX has about 25% share of the market actually using cards today), even though companies like Comdata and FleetCor (NYSE:FLT) are not going to let up in their efforts to gain share.Beyond share growth, I believe WEX still has an opportunity to improve its revenue-per-transaction. Management is reluctant (wisely, in my view) to increase fees across the board even though there's a wide gap with FleetCor (about $1.46 versus $2.89), but they are looking to increase avoidable fees like late payment fees and paper statement fees, and there may be more they can do in terms of their payment and collection cycles. Based upon management's recent comments, I'm not sure that significant fuel hedging is a part of future plans, as hedging didn't really do a lot to reduce share price volatility in the past.WEX's opportunities outside of the U.S. could be even more significant. The acquisition of ExxonMobil's (NYSE:XOM) ESSO card business has generated higher revenue than expected (as well as higher costs...), but WEX has only scratched the surface of what its European business could be. With an addressable vehicle market of over 55 million and just 2% or so in market share today, Europe could become even bigger than the U.S. if/when large oil companies decide to get out of the card game even with the presence of rivals like FleetCor in the market.Latin America and Asia likewise offer largely untapped markets for WEX. These markets aren't as well developed in terms of card usage and the presence of larger trucking companies, but they do offer a lot more growth potential relative to North America and Europe.Non-Trucking Ops Are AppealingWEX also has a sizable growth opportunity in its travel and healthcare payment processing operations.The travel business is built around virtual MasterCards, which allow online travel agencies to make use of one-time cards that reduce fraud and unauthorized charges. WEX already has high teens share in this market (and probably double that in the merchant market), but there is an opportunity to leverage not only above-average growth in online travel arrangements but also gain share with other travel agents.Healthcare is a more confounding opportunity in my view. The company has seen slow adoption of business-to-business virtual payments in healthcare primarily because there hasn't been a compelling cost advantage to doing so. The acquisition of Evolution 1 and the entry into consumer-directed healthcare offers a better value proposition. Evolution 1 is basically a technology platform services provider for HSA and FSA accounts, helping providers manage these accounts and process transactions. WEX has a decent toehold in this market (with around 8% to 10% share) and at double that level this could be a $50M/quarter business.Estimating The ValueI believe there are several credible ways to value WEX, including adjusted free cash flow, long-term ROE-based excess returns, and EV/EBITDA. On the free cash flow side, I believe that WEX can credibly grow revenue at an annualized rate of 10% over the next decade, as relatively slower growth in the U.S. fleet business is supplemented with growth in Europe, Asia, and Latin America fleet management, as well as travel and healthcare payment processing. I believe adjusted free cash flow margins in the mid-20%'s are attainable, supporting a fair value in the low $100's. With every 1% of long-term revenue growth worth another $9 of fair value, faster penetration of Europe and/or more traction in healthcare would definitely add value.I get a similar fair value in the low $100's with an excess returns model using ROEs in the high teens, but an 11x multiple to 12-month EBITDA (in line with my expectation of EBITDA growth over the next three years) would support a fair value of $115. All of that said, I've been too conservative on WEX before and missed out on some good growth as a result.The Bottom LineThe nature of WEX's business means that reported results are going to bounce around a lot on a quarterly basis, but I think the company's consistent transaction growth and transaction margins argue that this is a profitable, growing business. What's more, it is a profitable growing business with upside across multiple markets.The question is whether to just buy in and trust the growth or wait for a better price. WEX has had numerous 10% pullbacks over the years and the nature of the business (combined with the valuation) all but guarantees an above-average level of volatility. I do like the prospects for share growth and transaction value growth in fleet, but I'd like to see better momentum in adjusted operating profits and EBITDA before paying up for growth."

The company is a steady grower, helped by a good number of acquisitions that at times have to be digested which can hit operating performance.WEX Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsHere is a little overview of the relative importance of its segments. From the earnings deck:The year has been good so far, but WEX is still tiny in its respective segments. From the earnings deck:So it is perhaps a little surprising to hear management say (Q3CC):The company's traditional segment is fleet (payments processing for corporate and government fleets) and this is still by far the largest segment. The fastest growth has come from Health & Employee Benefits:Organic growth (excluding positive impacts from higher fuel prices, foreign exchange rates, the new revenue recognition standard, and M&A activity) was 8.4%, pretty solid. From the Q3 10-Q:Fleet, their biggest segment has some moving parts like gasoline prices, up in Q3 and credit loss, which was 14.2 basis points of spend volume, much better than the 23.5 basis points last year.With higher fuel prices, operating debt levels increase so this was a good performance. Their net interchange rate (covering stuff like transaction cost and credit risk) increased to 119 basis points (up 2 points from last year.There are reasons for optimism as they are in the early transition phase of the Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Shell (NYSE:RDS.A) (NYSE:RDS.B) portfolios. This is still in the phase where cost (S&M, the infrastructure to deal with additional calls and volume, etc.) are running ahead of revenues, but there is a normal evolution:This is a similar evolution to what the company experienced from their partnership with Exxon Mobil (XOM) for its European commercial fuel card program. Here is what management expects when the ramp is complete (Q3CC):The Travel segment increased revenues by 36% (11% volume growth) in Q3 (y/y) driven by the AOC acquisition (good for $8.8M or 10.5% of segment revenue in Q3 or 10.5%) and strong performance in Asia and Brazil.The latter is perhaps a little curious as Brazil was mentioned as a reason for the relatively low growth in their Health segment, just 1% in Q3 (y/y). Their US Health business is doing well, growing 13%. Overall SaaS accounts are up by 16%.Another source of growth, which helps gaining customers and expanding the TAM is the introduction of new technologies and solutions, like:Another source of growth is acquisitions, like:Noventis is the latest acquisition (for roughly $300M) and it will be slightly accretive from the start and expected to close in Q1 next year. This acquisition brings several benefits:Cooperation deals is another route, like the deal the company struck in November with Japanese card issuer JCB to expand WEX’s virtual payments technology into Japan. According to management, this is a real differentiator in the market there, even if it will take time to implement (towards the end of next year).There were some headwinds in the quarter as well:There was surprisingly little discussion on the Q3CC about how the oil crash (which was already well on its way at the time, late October) will impact this as the company receives a percentage of its customer's fuel spend.US Retail Gas Price data by YChartsBut one can gauge the impact from the rise in Q3, from Q3CC:Since we're having a gasoline price fall in the same order, it's not unreasonable to expect something in the order of a $5M hit (albeit in the quarter, making this a $20M hit on a yearly run basis).This could be lower because of hedging which they've done in the past but in the 10-Q, there was nothing about that. Here is what SA contributor Darspal Mann argued back in 2016:That's more than double our estimate, providing gasoline prices stay in the $2.60 range for a year. It's very early days for that, needless to say. Nevertheless, even a $50M hit is just 3.4% of revenues while the shares are more than 20% off their highs.Even if the hit to profit could be a little higher as the fleet segment is the most profitable, the gasoline price fall should be priced in by now.For Q4:They used an old slide for the outlook in the deck (giving the Q3, rather than Q4 outlook). Management's Q4 gasoline price outlook for Q4 ($2.85 per gallon) may be quite optimistic in light of the recent events (see graph above). Management once again raised 2018 guidance after the Q3 beat:As the last SA article by Darspal Man argued, competitor FleetCorp (FLT) got a little ahead. WEX has managed to close the gap this year:WEX data by YChartsDarspal Mann also had another concern back in 2016:But apparently, innovation and acquisitions have enabled the company to stay relevant, as is testified by the big contracts from Chevron and Shell and the volume growth in general. In fairness to Mann, he foreshadowed some of this by touting the then recent EFS acquisition.WEX Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsGross margins have been trending up and this is part of the scalable business model. Adding new customers, acquiring companies, entering new segments and services scale revenues while much of the underlying payment processing machine remains.But as they continue to do this, they also take regular hits to operating cost from acquisition-related cost, R&D, integration cost, sales and the like so it's not all that surprising to see the downtrend, even if 2018 has reversed that.On a non-GAAP basis, operating margin increased 210 basis points to 39.2%. Needless to say, nearly 40% operating margin is pretty substantial.WEX Cash from Operations (TTM) data by YChartsCash flow took a big hit in 2016, but has recovered in the past two years. Share-based compensation isn't a big source of dilution and the company has been relatively sparse with issuing new shares even for acquisitions.WEX Stock Based Compensation (TTM) data by YChartsThe acquisitions are financed by cash and mostly debt:WEX Net Debt Issuance (TTM) data by YChartsBut the company also held $533M in cash at the end of Q3. The leverage is 3.3x, which is down from 4.1x a year ago but the Noventis acquisition will add 0.4x to that. It has refinanced a significant part of its outstanding debt (Q3CC):They do hedge against interest rate changes, roughly 75% of their debt is essentially fixed that way.WEX PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsAnalysts expect an EPS of $8.21 this year rising to $9.5 in 2019, which gives the company a reasonable forward multiple of just over 16. EPS is up from $5.41 last year, a considerable acceleration this year.The shares have gone down in fairly rapid order with the general market, and also on the gasoline price slump, which we think is a little overdone.We think the ramp in the Shell and Chevron contracts next year, and the impuls from the Noventis acquisition bode well for 2019, although investors have to keep in mind that the debt level is fairly high.This isn't a huge problem as the company is mostly hedged against higher rates and cash flow is quite solid. Gasoline prices are bound to sully the Q4 results and might do so for 2019 as well if they stay this low, but it should be priced in as the effect is rather modest. Lower economic growth might also be a problem next year."

With broad acceptance, excellent technology, proprietary datasets, directly integrated into its customers operations, WEX (ticker WEX) perfectly classifies as a FINTECH business. However, unlike other more well-known payment franchises (like Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, etc), WEX is definitely not a household name. Within the FINTECH community, especially in fleet management and B2B payments, WEX is broadly recognized as a dominant leader. We love the fact that you probably have never heard of WEX and the S&P 500 has not yet added this great mid-cap company to it index. Let’s just keep it our little secret, OK?In our opinion, the payment sector is the quintessential FINTECH business. More and more individuals are migrating from cash and check to card and mobile payments. More companies are shifting their accounting and payment systems from paper checks to automated software tools. WEX perfectly sits at the intersection between the migration from cash to card, as well as on the complex B2B (business-to-business) payment channel. WEX is powered by the belief that complex payment systems can be made simple. We will layout our case for WEX as a dominant FINTECH company, highlight its potential for continued growth and do a deep analysis of its key attributes and strengths.To the average person, the world of payment processing is very complicated. In the US, on a typical $100 credit card transaction, there is $2.50 in fees taken from the merchant. This fee is often called the MDR (merchant discount rate) and is the cost for a merchant for accepting a credit card transaction. In the diagram below (from Manole Capital Management), you can see the breakdown of that fee.For taking the vast majority of the credit risk and essentially providing a one-month line of credit, the card issuer earns the bulk of the MDR fees. On this typical $100 credit card transaction, the card issuer earns 70% or $1.75.For handling the authorization, clearing and settlement (as well as the bulk of the work), the merchant acquirer and payment processors earn 24% of the MDR or $0.60.Lastly, for owning the network that these trillions of transaction occur on, the payment networks earn a steady, predictable, recurring revenue stream of 6% of the MDR or $0.15.In WEX’s card business (inside of its Fleet division, as well as its Corporate Payments business), we like to keep the above economic model in mind. Like a card issuer, WEX is providing credit (with significant information to minimize risk). Like a payment network, WEX is connecting various disparate players. Like a processor, WEX handles the heavy lifting of authorization, clearing and settlement of payments.WEX is located in Portland Maine and was started in 1983. Its IPO occurred on February 16, 2005 at $18/share, implying a $720 million valuation. As the chart shows, WEX has grown tremendously and is roughly 10x its valuation from 14 years ago.WEX’s 5-year revenue CAGR is an impressive 17.5%, with an EPS CAGR of nearly 18%. During the most recent quarter, WEX was able to generate operating income margins over 34%, which is more than 2x the typical S&P 500 company average.In 7 of the last 10 years, WEX has outperformed the S&P 500. As the chart above shows, WEX has materially exceeded the market recently. Just this year, WEX is up 43% versus the S&P 500 up 16%.While WEX’s execution and track record is impressive, we always strive to look forward and anticipate, as opposed to pay for prior performance. Each company and stock specific analysis must make the case for owning a stock looking forward. We believe the outlook for WEX is bullish.Quite simply, WEX’s mission is “to put control into the hands of their customers”. As customers transact, WEX looks to connect the payment with data and technology. By understanding the needs of its customers, WEX is able to provide significant information and value add. WEX operates in over 10 countries, in more than 20 currencies through 4,800+ global employees. WEX helped process over $74 billion of transactions and generated over $1.4 billion in annual revenue in 2018. WEX has a number of unique competitive advantages (technology, brand, innovation), which we will address in detail.WEX reports four revenue lines on its Income Statement (pie charts below are from Manole Capital Management models):Revenue by Segment:WEX operates three distinct divisions: % of WEX Total:Division (1q’19): Revenue EBITDA MarginsFleet Solutions 61% 61% 52.4%Travel & Corp Pmts 21% 22% 52.7%Health & Benefits 18% 17% 49.5%Fleet Solutions provides payment and transaction processing services for the needs of commercial and government fleets. Fleets can be small, medium and large customers or over-the-road, long haul businesses. At the end of the 1st quarter of 2019, WEX fleet cards covered more than 13.1 million vehicles, but this represented less than 10% of the addressable fleet market. Examples of client wins and renewals are NFI, Knight Transportation, Schneider, Bennett, Daseke, KllM, Verizon, US Department of Homeland Security, Werner Enterprises, Fed Ex, Roadrunner, Transport America, Crete Carrier and Duke Energy. (Update, June 19, 2019, 2:40 p.m.: This section has been updated to remove mention of USPS and revise language to include client renewals.)In our opinion, the key metrics to monitor are:The power of WEX’s Fleet business is its seamless, data driven technology. It allows businesses to take back control of their growing fleets, and provides critical portfolio risk and operational capabilities. Its technology delivers flexible, scalable and reliable information. By leveraging WEX’s core platform, businesses can adequately manage their fleet and all of their expenditures.WEX owns its own proprietary payment network that is accepted at over 160,000 locations in North America. Examples include BP, Citgo, Chevron, Shell, Conoco, Exxon and Mobil. WEX creates direct payment terms with these merchants and provides discounts for its fleet customers. WEX’s robust data capabilities allow its customers to get comfort that transactions are secure and error free.Example of a typical WEX Fleet transaction:Within this segment, WEX generates its revenue by processing payment transactions for its clients. While we do not want to get too technical in how fuel payment transactions occur, we thought it might be helpful to discuss a few different customer options. We will try to simplify the complicated. While WEX states that the majority of its revenue is based on a percentage of the aggregate dollar amount of the customer’s purchase, there are sometimes fixed amounts added to transactions.Clients could also choose “ Cost Plus” pricing model, which is directly tied to fuel price spreads. If we assume a fuel price of $2.86 per gallon, WEX would add a $0.05 markup to arrive at $2.91 per gallon. Also, a client can choose to have a “ Percentage Discount” methodology. Wholesale prices tend to decline faster than retail prices, but this model is directly influenced by the price of fuel. In this example, $3.00 is charged, with the client getting a $0.09 discount to come to that same $2.91 per gallon. Some clients might prefer“Fixed Fee” pricing, which is not influenced by fuel price changes and simply adds a fixed fee to each transaction. This would look like $2.91 getting charged, with the client paying a $0.09 fixed fee. So, customers can choose whichever pricing model they desire. From WEX’s perspective, each transaction is incrementally more and more profitable, regardless of which methodology is used. For WEX, the name of the game is to drive transactions and volumes over their scalable platform. In addition to payment processing revenue, WEX can also earn account servicing and finance fees too.The total addressable market, in terms of revenue opportunity, is roughly $10 billion. It is estimated that 35% of the total US commercial vehicle market does not have a fleet card. Over the next several years, the fleet market should continue to grow in the low-to-mid single digits, with especially strong growth in certain international markets. To deliver this growth, WEX plans on increasing wallet share of non-fuel spend, stealing additional market share and scaling its international presence. The below image is from a marketing email received recently. It shows how clients can issue fuel cards (through Shell) and earn significant discounts.Positive Catalysts:The biggest opportunity and positive catalyst for WEX is the conversions of the Shell and Chevron portfolios. These are two of the largest oil company portfolios in North America and WEX now has 9 of the Top 10 big oil portfolios on its platform. Their transition to WEX will have a meaningful impact on revenues, margins and profits, in both 2019 and 2020. In our opinion, these two conversions have been the primary focus on WEX management, especially their Fleet Solutions team.During the 1st quarter of 2019, the Shell portfolio was converted and completed. Shell volumes are currently “in line” with WEX projections and they should ramp throughout the year. By the end of the 2 nd quarter of 2019, Chevron is slated to be finished. We believe this can become a positive catalyst for WEX. To quote CEO Smith, on WEX’s 1 st quarter conference call, “the successful and timely conversion of both Shell and Chevron remain our primary short-term focus. I'm happy to report that both conversions are progressing on schedule.”The Street understands that successfully implementing both Shell and Chevron are the single most important items for WEX to accomplish. Besides kickstarting growth, there is an imbedded margin lift associated with these program integrations. WEX takes on significant costs to convert the portfolios and integrate these brands onto their platform. These costs are upfront, before WEX has an opportunity to get all of the revenues and profits associated with the new business. As WEX progresses through 2019, we anticipate it will surprise to the upside, on both the revenue and margin side of the equation. Management has framed the impact of these two portfolios equating to a full-year revenue lift of between $60 and $70 million. On a full run-rate basis, these two portfolios should translate into roughly $800 million in payment processing gallons. As these clients and volumes ramp, WEX should see positive growth, and especially rising operating margins.Also, this division highlights WEX’s “BIG data” play. There is no doubt that the Street is attracted to the growing influence of big data. Those companies that can help customers harness vast amounts of information are rewarded with healthy multiples. Data collecting and collating will continue to be a crucial element across all of WEX’s divisions. WEX can break through this massive amount of information with its ClearView analytics and reporting software. This software helps fleet managers by providing digestible, actionable insights that help them successfully maintain budgets, improve performance, find cost savings and spot red flags.Travel & Corporate Solutions segment essentially focuses on business-to-business payments (B2B), but we view this sector as two distinct entities. In fact, over the next several years, we would not be surprised to see WEX management split these two businesses into separate divisions.The Travel business works with OTA’s (online travel agencies), Corporate Travel Managers and Travel Wholesalers. This business is in 210 countries and handles payments in 21 different currencies. While offline travel bookings are fairly flat, the vast majority of growth is being generated online. Global travel booking volume is expected to continue to grow and eclipse $1.5 trillion by 2021. The total addressable market size of the Travel business is in the high $20 billion range, while WEX is currently under $2 billion (less than 10%).Example of a typical WEX Travel transaction:WEX’s virtual card solution has several key benefits. Not only is it deeply integrated with online platforms, but it has automated reconciliation, significant fraud protections and the capability to globally issue and fund. The VCN might be getting a little too technical for this research note, but WEX has found that moving to virtual payments allows its customers and suppliers several distinct advantages. With VCNs, clients get faster payments, easier reconciliation (across borders) and detailed and improved analytics. We like how WEX handles virtual cards, but also that it has a strong background in all types of cards, from purchasing cards to T&E cards to payroll cards.The Corporate Payments business is quite different from Travel and we believe it is more akin to a B2B platform. WEX provides its customers (corporations, financial institutions, etc) with processing solutions that simplify their payments process. By providing transaction-level information on accounts payable, clients have significantly more insight into their cash flows.WEX’s core offering is to optimize payment workflows, for both buyers and suppliers. Regardless of business vertical or size, WEX’s goal is to eliminate the pain point of payments. By utilizing WEX’s services, businesses can minimize the operational burden associated with payment reconciliation and processing. Businesses appreciate WEX’s security features and love getting off of their dated in-house legacy systems. This segment allows businesses to centralize purchasing, simplify complex supply chain processes and eliminate the paper check writing associated with traditional purchase order programs. As a component of WEX’s product suite, it offers electronic payments and corporate cards. The benefits of WEX’s electronic payments solution is that it is fully integrated into a company’s payables / processing platforms.WEX markets to commercial and government organizations, and it uses existing open-loop (i.e. Visa and MasterCard) networks. WEX sells directly to large corporate business and it works with various financial institutions (""FI"") and AP/vendor management partners to reach SMBs. On the FI front, WEX has spend volume in excess of $25 billion with clients like American Express, PNC, Key Bank, Regions and Commerce Bank. On the partnership front, WEX has spend volume over $5 billion, with clients like Bill Go, MDSL, DIY and Pay Clearly.Looking back to our diagram on page 1, WEX acts and looks like all three components of a card transaction. It manages the card issuing, transaction authorization, clearing, settlement and statementing. It essentially combines the heavy lifting of the merchant acquiror and processor, with the credit of a card issuer and bank. Plus, WEX operates its own closed-loop payment network, so it even has similarities to a Visa or Mastercard.The key metrics to monitor are:Positive Catalysts:There is no questioning that B2B is “hot”! At recent conferences, both Visa and Mastercard have made huge announcements focusing on the B2B market. In addition, both networks have made acquisitions to increase their exposure to the growing B2B opportunity. We expect these two large franchises to attack this large, untapped market, but expect WEX to compete in its specialty.Within its June upgrade note, Goldman Sachs highlighted how the B2B sector is a massive $130 trillion market, with an annual revenue opportunity of $1 trillion. We would caution using this whole B2B market as WEX’s opportunity. Goldman is factoring in all payment processing, cross border transactions, working capital solutions, accounts payable / receivable and supply chain automation. There is plenty of opportunity, inside of this smaller niche, for WEX to succeed. For example, we would prefer to see WEX focus on accounts payable and not waste its resources and time on accounts receivable or merchant financing. We would prefer to stay out of those segments.From a macro perspective, there is no denying that the US B2B market is accelerating away from checks and towards electronic commercial payments. We believe the total addressable market, in terms of US electronic commercial payments, is roughly $9 billion. Estimates are looking for this B2B payment market to essentially double, to $18 billion, by 2021.Health & Employee Benefit Solutions segment involves healthcare payment products, as well as a SaaS (Software as a Service) platform. In the complex healthcare marketplace, WEX provides consumer-directed payments. It has relationships with approximately 343,000 employers with a reach of 28 million consumers. Over 500 companies in the Fortune 1000 are WEX Health Cloud platform customers. WEX’s platform sits in between customers, employers, and government programs and on the other side are healthcare providers, carriers and payees. This segment’s revenue is generated primarily from monthly SaaS fees, as well as interchange fees from customer spending on health savings accounts, debit cards and reimbursement accounts. WEX has an impressive 97% revenue retention rate.The key metrics to monitor are:The total annual cost of healthcare, for an American family, has dramatically increased over the last decade (in 2018 it is roughly $28k). With 10,000 Baby Boomers retiring every day, the healthcare dilemma continues to present an interesting challenge. The total addressable market, in terms of revenue opportunity, is roughly $2.5 billion. Over the next several years, the Health & Employee Benefits market should grow in the low-to-mid-teens.Positive Catalysts:Unlike the catalysts we listed above, sometimes time can heal a wound. The US has displayed solid mid-teens growth, and is the clearly the star of the Healthcare business. However, inside of Employee Benefits, Brazil has been a headwind (and headache). In Brazil, WEX offers a pay day advance benefits product through employers. While it is less than 2% of WEX’s total revenue, Brazil has been volatile. Management is hoping a price cut could spur growth, but time will tell if this fixes the problem.The positive catalyst is that Brazil is beginning to anniversary (12-months of being a nuisance). Starting in the 2 nd half of 2019, year-over-year growth in Employee Benefits won’t feel the pain of this troublesome business. Quite simply, time passing will allow this Brazilian business to go from a drag or headwind, to an issue in the rearview mirror.On the 1st quarter 2019 conference call, CEO Smith said 2019 “is shaping up to be a milestone year”.WEX understands how to “play the game”, in the sense of providing achievable financial targets and guidance. The ultimate goal is to consistently “beat and raise” results, which will boost a stock higher and higher. Looking at 2019, WEX expects revenue to grow by in the range of $1.705 billion to $1.745 billion, representing 14% to 17% annual growth. One the earnings front, management expects results in the $9.10 to $9.50, representing 19% to 24% annual growth.We believe free cash flow (""FCF"") is the most important financial metric to calculate and monitor for any business. Our WEX calculation of FCF takes operating cash flow, then adjusts for changes in deposits and then factors in depreciation, amortization (excluding purchase intangibles) and capex (capital expenditures). After some quick math, our version of FCF equals $274 million in 2017 and $362 million last year (over 30% year-over-year growth). Looking forward, we believe FCF at WEX could soon approach $500 million.There are numerous uses of FCF, which we think differs by industry, opportunity and management opinion. Priority #1, at least for WEX, is to invest back into its own business. Their goal is to generate long-term organic growth. To improve performance and increase product development, WEX adopted a cloud first development process and began integrating its operations and platforms with cloud-based technology. This is just one R&D initiatives that WEX has deployed. It also has a Blockchain plan, to utilize the distributed ledger solution to transform its payment workflow, and increase both transparency and security. WEX also has plans to develop machine learning and important AI programs. On the mobile front, WEX is beginning to replace traditional payment methodologies and bring real-time transfers to mobile and connected devices. Lastly, WEX is experiencing an explosion of Big Data, cloud computing and storage benefits. It has an enormous amount of transaction level data and WEX is striving to take this information and re-package it for the benefit of their customers. For example, one WEX client recently said, “I don’t need 10,000 rows of data. I just want WEX to tell me what I need to know.”Internally developing a software stack is costly and does not have an immediate ROI (return on investment). These technology investments (our version of R&D) should help automate payment flow. Investors must have a long-term perspective and give management teams enough time to let their game plan unfold. These investments are costly in the short-run, but will pay huge dividends for shareholders in 2020 and beyond.In August of 2017, we wrote a research note titled ""How Global Payments Changed the Merchant Acquiring Business"", click here for the SA link. We wanted to highlight how GPN transformed the merchant processing business, with a small acquisition made five years earlier (in August of 2012). Just like GPN focused on acquiring ISVs (integrated software vendors) to permanently changed the payment landscape, we believe WEX’s investments will payoff down-the-road.Next, management can use its excess FCF to make acquisitions (discussed on the next page), paydown debt, buyback stock and/or pay a dividend. Historically, WEX has not been an aggressive buyer of their own stock. The Board and management must believe its organic investments (and acquisitions) are a better use of cash. As of now, WEX does not pay a dividend. We believe a modest ~ 1.0% dividend yield could easily be enacted, especially with the impressive free cash flow of this business. While nobody will get rich off a modest 1% dividend yield, there are certain investors that require some yield, in order to invest. Lastly, WEX can paydown debt. Historically, WEX de-levers by roughly 0.50 to 0.75 turns a year. Management targets a leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3.5x EBITDA, but it currently stands at 4.0x. Over the next several quarters, we anticipate WEX using a modest amount of FCF to paydown less advantaged debt. By getting into their desired leverage range, management will have the capacity to bring on additional accretive deals. Speaking of acquisitions…In the FINTECH space, there has been numerous very large transactions this year. In January, Fiserv (ticker FISV) acquired First Data (FDC). Then in March, Fidelity National (ticker FIS) acquired Worldpay (ticker WP), formerly Vantiv (ticker VNTV). Then in May, Global Payments (ticker GPN) merged with Total System Solutions (ticker TSS). These three massive deals have made 2019 one of the busiest years ever for FINTECH transactions. We were involved and owned all six of these companies, so 2019 has been quite good. However, we actually prefer the “tuck in” strategy versus these mammoth acquisitions. This is something that Les Muma, former CEO of Fiserv, essentially coined in the 1990s. Instead of making huge, costly deals, with tons of integration headaches, FISV was legendary at doing smaller “bite sized” deals. We believe it is smarter to make smaller deals (of companies nobody has ever heard of) that more importantly, can easily get “tucked into” your organization. We prefer WEX follows Les Muma’s transcript, rather than making a massive splash in the M&A market.In addition to organic growth, WEX is executing a steady and solid M&A strategy. While WEX consistently seeks to grow its organic growth opportunities, it does have a solid acquisition track record. Throughout WEX’s history, the company has made several acquisitions to enhance its scale and differentiate its offerings. We just discussed the important integration of the Shell and Chevron portfolios. The Shell win was just for new accounts and WEX chose not to purchase their legacy portfolio. However, WEX brought Chevron onboard and did acquire their legacy portfolio for $223 million. We believe that WEX performed a detailed analysis of each firm’s existing book of business. WEX was flexible and successfully brought both portfolios on-board, with only 1 of the 2 needing to be “acquired”.WEX recently acquired Noventis, an electronic payments network and bill payments provider. Specifically, this deal should expand WEX’s reach as a corporate payment supplier and provide more channels into financial institutions. Back in March, WEX spent $425 million to acquire Discovery Benefits (""DBI""), an employee benefits administrator to over one million consumers across all 50 states. WEX knows DBI well and has been a partner of theirs for over 10 years. DBI offers account administration and healthcare services through its unique and proprietary technology platform and it should nicely fit into WEX’s Healthcare division.Also, in March, WEX announced its plans to purchase the European fuel card business from EG Fleet. EG Fleet’s “G Fuel Card” brand has over 200,000 cars in the Netherlands, France, Belgium and Luxembourg. This transaction should strengthen WEX’s presence and capabilities in a few European markets. These transactions, and the on-boarding of the Shell and Chevron portfolios, has kept management busy. However, we expect WEX to continue to add smaller businesses during the year and they claim that their deal pipeline is “very full”.Looking at the typical US credit card transaction (on page 1), WEX’s business has similarities to card issuers, payment networks as well as processors. On the Fleet business, WEX’s most logical and closest competitor is FleetCor (ticker FLT). Both stocks, as of this writing (mid-June 2019) are up roughly 45% this year. Owning both companies (which we have), has been a great decision.As the chart shows, over the last 5 years, WEX and FLT have essentially traded in lock-step with each other. Fleet Solutions is WEX’s largest division and it represents 61% of revenue and EBITDA (as of the 1 st quarter of 2019). EBITDA margins in this division are an impressive 52.4% versus FleetCor’s 54.7%.We appreciate that FLT provides the Street with significantly more information and insights into their fleet. For example, FLT reports operating margins by region (North America versus Intl’) and breaks down its metrics by fuel cards, corporate payments, tolls, lodging, as well as gift cards. FLT differentiates its revenue mix into Customer versus Merchant fees. Inside of Customer Fees, FLT lays out processing revenue, program dues, late fees, and finance charges. Within Merchant Fees, FLT shows discount / fuel fees, fuel spread revenue and program charges. By providing statistics into transactions, revenue per transaction, organic growth rates, and margins, analysts and investors can properly estimate future results. Selfishly, from a modeling perspective, we would like to see WEX “open up the kimono” a little bit more. That being said, there can be no doubt that these two businesses dominate the fleet management industry. In our opinion, they are clearly the #1A and #1B in the fleet sector.Over a three year period, WEX has slightly exceeded FLT’s performance. We would attribute this to several factors. One, FLT is much more of a pure play on the Fleet business, while WEX has more diversification and exposure to other areas (primarily travel and healthcare). Also, we would be remiss if we did not highlight the Street’s different perspective of their CEOs. We do not want to place much credence to a recent negative article written by Citron Research, as we believe it is materially flawed on some of its accusations and conclusions. However, the author did highlight a widely recognized Street-wide viewpoint. Certain investors have a less-than-positive opinion of FLT’s CEO Ron Clarke, while WEX’s CEO Melissa Smith gets nothing but rave reviews from the buy and sell side community. In our opinion, the perception (whether it is true or not) of Smith versus Clarke has had some impact on their respective stock prices. Speaking of management….We recently did a quick Google search for the number of women that lead large, US companies. Using the S&P 500 as our benchmark, there are unfortunately only 26 women that hold the CEO title. Click here to see the Catalysts article listing women CEOs’ in the S&P 500. At only 5% of the S&P 500, women CEO’s are still not equally represented at the top of US businesses.We have met WEX’s CEO Melissa Smith several times and believe she is an excellent leader. She continues to get the best out of her team, and she articulates WEX’s differentiated business model quite well. CEO Smith joined WEX in 1997, as a senior financial analyst in their global corporate payments group. She worked her way up the corporate ladder, including roles as CFO and President of the Americas. She spearheaded WEX’s successful IPO in 2005 and shows no signs of slowing down. She has received numerous awards: Mainebiz’s “Women to Watch”, PYMNTS.com’s “Most Innovative Woman in Payments” and PaymentSource’s “Most Influential Woman in Payments”.We believe Melissa Smith is a major asset for WEX and her skills stand on their own merit, regardless of her gender. We believe that more companies would be better equipped to handle and manage complex business environments, if they had more females in senior leadership positions (whether as CEO or on their Board of Directors).We utilize multiple valuation techniques to build out our 1-year price target. We will blend our P/E and EV (enterprise value) to EBITDA valuation analysis to create a price target a year out. We focus on FCF, but often have issues with straight DCFs (discounted cash flow) models. Why? Because changing a quarter a point in a discount rate or the terminal growth rate can swing a valuation by a huge amount. We try not to let the model or numbers dictate our analysis, and prefer to interpret the metrics to build a proper framework.Another valuation we like to utilize is a SoTP (sum-of-the-parts) analysis. This can often be useful, if a company has several divisions that could possibly be spun-out or divested. One could argue that WEX could breakup its business and let Travel or Healthcare or Employee Benefits stand on its own. At this point, we do not believe these segments are large enough to be independent. WEX is still building its three segments, both organically and through acquisitions. Since we do not envision management and the Board decided to split it up at this point in time, we will bypass doing a SoTP valuation. To keep things simple, our 1-year forward price target will be using a standard P/E and EV to EBITDA valuation methodology.Historical valuations:Using FactSet data and history as our guide, WEX has an average 3-year and 5-year forward P/E multiple of 19.8x and 19.5x respectively. On an EV to EBITDA basis, the forward multiple, over the 3-year and 5-year periods is 13.5x and 13.0x respectively. As we highlighted on page one, WEX is currently trading at 19.9x 2020 earnings, which is right at its 3-to-5 year average. Again, comparing WEX’s current forward EV to EBITDA multiple of 13.0x, we see that it is trading right on its recent history average.As this chart shows, both WEX and FLT have traded at a premium to the overall market (using the S&P 500 as the benchmark). We hope that many of the details we have laid out in this note, to some extent, help prove why WEX deserves to trade at a premium valuation. If you want additional evidence, we look to WEX’s peers to provide some confirmation on what fair value might be.As we just discussed on the last page, we believe FLT is the best peer for WEX. FLT trades at 21.8x earnings and 15.9x EBITDA. On the B2B front, one could argue that WEX competes with Bottomline Technologies (EPAY), which trades at a forward P/E of 61x. In the travel business, Sabre and Amadeus trade at forward P/E’s of 20.2x and 24.9x respectively.Visa and Mastercard both operate payment platforms and these dominant networks trade at forward P/E’s of 27.3x and 28.9x respectively. Global Payments is a Top 10, soon to be Top 5 payment processor, with its deal to merge with Total Systems. Vantiv combined with Worldpay in 2018 and recently was acquired by Fidelity National. While not a perfect comparison, there is a decent argument that GPN, WP and WEX are peers, since all handle payment processing, as well authorize, clear and then settle transactions. Worldpay trades at a forward P/E multiple of 23.4x and GPN trades at 24.3x forward estimates. In comparison to various payment processing peers, WEX is trading at a roughly 10% to 20% discount.P/E:Starting with a traditional P/E calculation, we believe a low-20’s forward multiple is fair, especially for a business of WEX’s quality. As of today, WEX is trading at 23.7x this year and 20.2x next year’s estimates. In comparison to the S&P 500, on 2020 estimates, WEX is trading at a roughly 20% premium.Let’s now spend a little time comparing how WEX compares to the overall market, in terms of revenue and earnings growth. WEX should be able to grow revenue next year in the low-to-mid teens. As of today, analysts expect the S&P 500 to grow sales by 4%. We have more confidence in WEX’s ability to generate revenue growth over 11%, than we do of the overall market to deliver 4%. On the earnings front, expect WEX should be able to meet and beat growth expectations of 17%. The S&P 500 is modeling in only 5% earnings growth next year. In our opinion, WEX deserves to trade at a 20% to 25% premium to the S&P 500, based on its excellent fundamentals, but we could argue it is justified considering it is growing revenue and earnings at 3x the level of the overall market.In our financial model, we see earnings potentially equaling $10.50 share in 2020. This would represent only 4% higher than current sell-side analysts’ estimates. We like that we do not need to inflate WEX’s current forward valuation multiple to arrive at our upside target. Taking that $10.50 in 2020 earnings and rolling forward WEX’s current P/E of 23.7x, would get to a price of $252/share or 26% upside.EV to EBITDAFor the next couple of years, EBITDA estimates are looking for mid-to-high teens growth. Right now, WEX’s EV to EBITDA is 15.4x. Once again, this valuation isn’t cheap. EBITDA and FCF growth are accelerating, providing management with ample resources to make necessary investments. In a positive environment, we model EBITDA reaching $900 million in 2020. This would only be 3% higher than current Street estimates. Rolling that 15.4x EV to EBITDA multiple forward and using $900 million in EBITDA, equates to a price target of $260/share or 26% of upside.Blending both the P/E and EV to EBITDA targets yields a 1-year forward target of $256/share or 25% higher than today’s price. As of today, there are 12 sell-side analysts covering WEX. 2/3 rd’s are positive and have a “buy” or “outperform” rating, while 1/3 rd of this group are at a “hold”. We like that we are conservative with our model and are not expecting herculean results. We believe that management can exceed expectations and maintain its multiple. As we laid out in this note, we see upside in results (especially from the Shell and Chevron portfolios) and believe the stock is poised to deliver over the next 12 to 18 months.All businesses have risks and issues for investors to be concerned with. WEX is no different….Valuation: As page one shows and our “Valuation” section discusses in detail, WEX trades a premium to the overall market. As long-term investors, we would love to own shares of WEX at a lower price point. However, companies that possess these type of characteristics, rarely are at “cigar butt” valuations. WEX deserves to trade at a premium to the overall market because it is a growth company, with excellent prospects in an intriguing and emerging category – FINTECH. With any investment, we look for companies that meet certain characteristics. We have listed these desirable traits below, and rest assured that WEX “checks the box” for us as long-term investors.Ideal Manole Capital Characteristics:Fuel:As WEX investors, our biggest risk is something that WEX has absolutely no control over. Besides analyzing and covering the space for nearly 25 years, one of the reasons we love the FINTECH sector is that the payments industry has years and years of secular growth opportunities ahead of it. Unfortunately, the energy sector is volatile and cyclical in nature. The price of fuel has numerous inputs (supply/demand, Middle East tensions, rig counts, global growth, etc), which move price up and down. We simply prefer consistent secular growth versus unpredictable cyclical businesses.At its most basic level, in its largest business segment(Fleet Solutions), WEX helps customers purchase fuel. 20% of WEX’s revenue is related to the dollar amount of fuel purchased by these customers. As a result, volatility in fuel prices (especially lower prices) has an adverse effect on the WEX’s revenues and profits.Using NYMEX fuel futures, prices are trending upwards, to roughly $2.95. WEX management assumed and guided for average fuel prices in the $2.85 range, so this just happens to be a positive or slight benefit this quarter. Fuel prices are historically volatile, and they just as easily could have been $0.10 to $0.20 lower (a negative for WEX). To frame the fuel impact, management believes that a $0.10 change in the average US fuel price equates $14 to $15 million in revenue and roughly $0.20 to earnings. We like that we can quantitatively measure and frame the upside and downside with fuel price swings. Before WEX reports, we have ample information, time and insight into what the blended (60% gasoline, 40% diesel) fuel prices are.With excellent growth in its non-Fleet businesses, the mix of revenue and profits generated and tied to fuel was declining. Back in 2016, the impact of a modest $0.10 fuel price change impacted earnings by 4.5%. Just two years later, the earnings impact declined to only 2.1%. However, in 2019, fuel sensitivity is now rising at WEX. Why? The sizeable Shell and Chevron portfolio acquisitions (mentioned above) will lift the percentage of the business coming from Fleet Solutions.We try not to let the underlying fuel price swings impact our long-term philosophy. Some quarters fuel will help. Some quarters fuel will hurt. We do not let this input sway our investment philosophy. Our bigger picture thinking is…Does WEX provide a service that customers need, want and find valuable? We believe it does and we would personally rather focus on the fundamentals of the underlying business, than worry about the macro, or in this case, the price of fuel. We have found that panicking or trading due to daily swings in fuel price curve is unhealthy and unprofitable. We understand that fuel price changes get adjusted in the daily stock price of WEX. In addition, sell-side analysts look at the fuel futures curve, and update their models and estimates. In our opinion, there are more pressing issues to focus on (like the fundamentals) than concerning ourselves with the fuel futures curve. We cannot control the infatuation WEX’s stock price correlation with fuel prices, but we can focus on the items we deem truly important.This chart shows this decision as wise. Over the last 5 years, WEX has significantly outperformed the oil and gas index (XOI). That index is obviously much more aligned and tied to the price of oil and gas. There absolutely is a correlation between WEX’s stock price and the price of fuel. We would suggest any WEX investor attempt to take a bigger picture perspective.Credit:WEX owns its own bank and this provides it with a key funding advantage, of roughly 200 basis points. In addition, by owning a bank, WEX has the control to issue its own cards. While most banks have massive securitization funding needs, WEX seems to have this process on auto-pilot.It is not the banking that is a concern for us, rather it is credit and potential portfolio losses. Quite simply, WEX is providing credit to its customers, by incurring charges and managing those payments. WEX does not get reimbursed until several days later. In the event of fraud or a client default, WEX is left “holding the bag”, or in this case, the loss. Elevated levels of credit losses and/or card fraud have a negative impact on earnings, dollar for dollar.Over the last several years, when credit losses occur, WEX’s stock is negatively impacted. If you want to see this credit impact, just look at any chart for WEX. The downward wiggles are either due to large swings in fuel prices or a surprising credit hiccup. Inside of our FINTECH portfolio, we understand and acknowledge that WEX has more credit risk, than we typically take with our payment positions (acquirers, processors or networks). We are comfortable that WEX management has the tools and capabilities to manage client transactions and monitor these credit risks.Acquisitions:As bottoms up, fundamental analysts, we always need our companies to generate sustainable organic growth. Growing organically always is better than growing simply through acquisitions. WEX checks the box with its impressive organic growth, but it is too dependent on deals?Another risk is that acquisitive companies can eventually stumble or “hit the wall”. Whenever a company, especially one that makes as many transactions and deals as WEX, there are risks. How will this acquired company get integrated? Will the acquiring company be able to absorb new employees? Is the current culture of this organization flexible and welcoming? On the infrastructure side of the equation, there are additional worries. Will new systems, platforms, technology and business models easily come on-board? Lastly, there are valuation and questions on rational capital allocation. Was management disciplined in their acquisition? Why was this acquired company so eager to sell? Was the price paid too aggressive or was their future outlook potentially overstated? Clearly, any business that relies on deals and acquisitions, creates a level of uncertainty and risk for investors.We feel like WEX has a solid infrastructure in place to vet potential deals and to pay a fair, and not too exorbitant a price. Any acquisition-focused strategy exposes a company to the twin risk of overpaying for a business and then potentially struggling to integrate such businesses. From our conversations with management, we believe they have a disciplined approach to deals. WEX considers accretion, five year return on investment, cash flow projections, price paid, valuation and insures the new business fits with WEX’s overall strategy. While no team is perfect, we are comfortable that WEX has the necessary processes in place to continue to make solid, accretive acquisitions.Client Concentration / Renewals:Additional risks are normal business risks, like the failure to renew key agreements or clients. For example, inside of the Healthcare division, WEX has some channel conflict following its acquisition of Discovery Benefits. In addition, with its recent large wins of Shell and Chevron, WEX has somewhat more customer concentration risk. Once again, these can be good problems to have. With client retention in the high-90’s, we do not believe this is an item that would prevent us from owning WEX.Many colleges and universities recently held graduation ceremonies. This got us thinking about how WEX will be graduating soon too. What do we mean? WEX should shortly graduate from a mid-cap company to a large-cap company. On page one, we mentioned how WEX is not in the S&P 500. A year ago, WEX’s primary competitor (FleetCor) wasn’t in the S&P 500 either. Getting added to the index can be a nice boost, normally in the 5% to 10%. In June of 2018, FLT got added to the S&P 500 index and popped higher.It is estimated that there is over $4.3 trillion in index products. The 500 or so companies in the S&P 500 represent roughly 80% of the total available US market capitalization. Each and every day, there are numerous articles and reports highlight how indexing continues to steal market share from traditional, active managers. As fundamental managers, we would prefer it you didn’t rub it in! Over the next one to two years, we will not be surprised if WEX gets added to the S&P 500. There is no guarantee that this will occur, so do not hold your breath. It is just something that should occur, when the index finally wakes up to WEX’s double-digit growth and superior market positioning. In the meantime, WEX can continue to be our stealthy mid-cap play.Even after an impressive 3-to-5 year run, we believe WEX has significant upside. WEX’s business model generates predictable and sustainable revenue growth. It maintains extremely high retention rates and its clients willingly sign long-term contracts. Each year, WEX flexes its pricing power by taking annual price increases of 1% to 2%. Like many payment networks, WEX operates a leverageable platform, that should enable it to generate very high incremental, transaction-based margins. By focusing on operating margin expansion, management can turn above average sales growth into faster earnings and FCF growth. In 9 of the last 10 quarters, we applaud management for delivering year-over-year operating margin improvement.WEX is a uniquely diversified company, versus traditional FINTECH businesses. While the Fleet Solutions business is impacted by the cyclical nature of fuel prices, we appreciate the secular nature and growing importance of WEX’s Corporate Payments and its Health business. These non-Fleet businesses, at roughly 40% of WEX’s revenue, are less cyclical, not impacted by volatile fuel prices, and are growing in the mid-teens.WEX has a durable competitive advantages and has established very high barriers to entry with its closed-loop network. Its competitive position is defensible, and it continues to widen its moat with selective and targeted acquisitions. WEX’s technology is sophisticated, scalable, but easy-to-understand as well as implement. We love that WEX operates in large and expanding markets, so the future has numerous evergreen opportunities. Finally, WEX has an excellent management team, that has done a solid job of allocating capital.There are not many companies that can comfortably provide long-term growth targets of 10% to 15% for revenue and 15% to 20% for net income. In our opinion, WEX has over 25% of upside, over the next year or so. Plus, we want to own a company based in Maine, so we can visit management (during the warmer summer months) and get a great lobster rollDISCLAIMER:Firm: Manole Capital Management LLC is a registered investment adviser.

2142793,24361,2014-04-16T13:41:24-04:00,"WEX still has a large, under-penetrated global market to address with its fleet card business.Virtual cards are growing well, and WEX has emerged as a leading player.Valuation is still demanding, as high teens growth appears to be factored into today's price.","Shares of corporate payments specialist WEX (NYSE:WEX) have hardly been still over the last six months, trading between $80 and $101 and sporting a beta (according to Yahoo! Finance) of 1.96. Even so, they are almost exactly where they were when I wrote that the company was a well-run player in attractive markets, but that the shares seemed a little expensive.WEX has made some important moves since October, including acquiring operations in Brazil and acquiring Exxon Mobil's (NYSE:XOM) European ESSO card business, but actual organic transaction growth has been fairly sluggish and the company's B2B virtual MasterCard (NYSE:MA) program is still a faster-growing work in progress. I do see multiple opportunities for WEX to do better, but there's already a meaningful amount of growth baked into the share price and I still find myself wishing for a better entry price.Still Driving Fleet CardsWEX's virtual card business is fast-growing (more on that in a moment), but the fleet card business is still the source of just under three-quarters of the company's revenue. As a quick reminder, WEX competes with companies like FleetCor (NYSE:FLT), Comdata, and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) through its closed-loop card network that processes payments for commercial and government vehicle fleets. WEX cardholders use WEX cards to buy fuel (or other approved products/services), WEX pays the merchants, collects a processing fee, and also charges other account and service fees. Vehicle operators benefit, in part, by being able to monitor and manage spending and also through WEX's lower fees.WEX has been steadily gaining share in its market, even though overall ""same store"" transaction volumes have been pretty weak (low single digits). Whereas Comdata is strong in long-haul trucking and FleetCor is strong in smaller fleets, WEX has done well with government accounts but is targeting Comdata's and FleetCor's markets as future sources of growth. WEX is also showing a little more willingness to leverage its pricing - FleetCor is quite a bit more aggressive with late fees, overlimit fees, and so on, and while WEX believes it has a long-term advantage in customer satisfaction and retention by charging less, there's still a sizable gap in average revenue per transaction ($1.42 for WEX and $2.53 for FleetCor).WEX is also serious about driving more overseas growth. The company acquired Exxon Mobil's European card program, bringing in around 1 million cards across 18 countries. European markets are still largely dominated by the oil majors, as oil companies like Total and Royal Dutch Shell have sizable market share in France and Denmark, respectively.Virtual Cards Still Hold Real PromiseB2B virtual cards remain a significant growth opportunity for WEX, where it is a leading issuing institution of virtual MasterCards. Online travel agencies (Priceline (PCLN), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), etc.) like to use these to control costs; the one-time, pre-authorized, highly specific nature of the virtual card allows the OTAs to hold a room after a customer has made the reservation, but prevents hotels from charging them for incidentals like room service. Having OTAs using virtual cards as an intermediary step (as opposed to using the client's own credit card) also reduces the opportunities for fraud and data/identify theft.While virtual cards are getting increasing usage in online travel (and WEX is starting to see ex-US growth kick in), the large healthcare market is still slow to come around. While there could be $100 billion in addressable payments for WEX to profit from, doctors and hospitals don't like accepting virtual cards due to the added cost.Robust Earnings Growth PotentialWhile WEX's fourth quarter results saw fleet payment volume increase 4% and a 2% higher vehicle count, MasterCard volumes were up nearly one-third. The latter is lower-margin business, but WEX nevertheless saw adjusted operating income growth of about 16%.Looking down the road, I think WEX could generate 17% to 18% annual EPS growth over the next five years as the return on equity moves closer to 18%. If WEX can get even more aggressive with fleet card pricing without overly compromising retention, there could still be upside to that number. On the other hand, expanding and growing the virtual card business is probably going to limit ROE upside as that becomes a more significant contributor to revenue and earnings.One risk factor worth noting is the company's captive WEX Bank. WEX uses this bank to access low-cost funds, but a rather large portion (around one-quarter) of its low-cost deposits come by way of Higher One (NYSE:ONE), a payment processing company focused on the higher education market, but one that has attracted the wrong kind of attention for its fees and business practices. Should something interrupt Higher One's business model, it is possible that WEX would face a short-term funding gap.The Bottom LineLooking at a long-term excess returns model (a model driven by long-term ROE assumptions), free cash flow, and ROE/book value, I come up with a range of fair value from $83.75 to $87.50. Even the high end of that range is not all that attractive relative to today's price, though I fully acknowledge the growth potential of the virtual card business and the significant margin leverage potential if WEX gets a little more aggressive on fleet card pricing. I wouldn't sell a fairly valued company that is likely to grow earnings at a strong mid-to-high teens rate, but I would like to see a little more discount to fair value before adding shares to my own account.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2274193,25120,2014-06-18T04:57:53-04:00,"WEX announces the $532 million acquisition of Evolution1.This is as the company diversifies away from its core fleet business.WEX's track record is very strong, shares offer appeal on dips.","WEX (NYSE:WEX), the provider of corporate card solutions announced the acquisition of privately-held Evolution1 in a move which will bolster its non-fleet offerings, as it expands its presence in the healthcare business.WEX has an excellent acquisition track record as well, having seen a profitable growth journey over the past decade. I like the shares, but won't jump on the momentum bandwagon with shares trading at their highs.Deal HighlightsWEX announced that it has agreed to acquire Evolution1, which provides cloud-based technology and payments solutions for the healthcare industry.WEX will pay $532.5 million in cash for the company with the deal expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings within a year after closing. WEX anticipates that the deal will close in the third quarter of this year after being approved in a unanimous fashion by the board of both companies.In 2013, Evolution1 processed some 65 million transactions representing $5 billion in transaction volume. 90,000 enterprises and 10 million consumers are being serviced through its solutions within North America. The company employs about 300 workers currently.Evolution1 has numerous products including 1Cloud, 1Direct, 1Pay, 1Mobile, 1Plan and 1View. These technology-based companies allow businesses to simplify payment, organization, usage and costs related to healthcare.Strategic Rationale For The DealWith the acquisition, WEX extends its scalable business into the high-growth and high-value markets for complex payment systems. This allows WEX to further simplify aspects of the healthcare payment system, while continue to expand into the fleet and travel industry.Payments are crucial in the huge healthcare system which is complicated with both consumers, providers and payers interacting through intermediaries like employers and exchanges.Within healthcare, WEX has traditionally focused on payment solutions to providers in a $1 trillion potential market opportunity. With the acquisition of Evolution1, WEX will also focus on B2B providing payment services to intermediaries as well.Note that healthcare is an emerging growth business for WEX which is still very much focused on fleet solutions which allow companies to save money, reduce administration hassles, give them collective purchase efficiencies and monitor driving behavior.Financial ImplicationsWEX pays $532.5 million for Evolution1 but it expects to benefit from $42 million in net present value from tax benefits, which lowers the effective purchase price to $490 million.No quantitative details regarding Evolution1's revenues or earnings have been announced in the company's press release. Given the modest size of Evolution1 with roughly 300 in staff, the opportunity for cost savings will be limited. Rather the value has to be driven by revenue and strategic synergies, like sharing best practices and technology in particular.Valuing WEXAt the end of March, WEX reported its first-quarter results. The company ended the quarter with $354.8 million in cash and equivalents. Total debt including term loans and revolving credit facilities stood at $681.2 million which results in a net debt position of $326.4 million.Following the purchase of Evolution1, this net debt position will increase towards $850 million excluding cash being held by the acquired company.At the time of the first-quarter earnings release, WEX guided for full-year revenues of $767 to $787 million, with adjusted earnings seen between $185 and $193 million. Note that GAAP earnings were about 10% lower than non-GAAP earnings in the first quarter.Investors in WEX are pleased with the deal, sending shares to levels around $104 per share. This values the company's equity at $4.0 billion, or 5.1 times annual revenues. Shares trade around 21 times adjusted earnings which implies a GAAP multiple in the low to mid-twenties.Long-Term WinnerInvestors have seen great long-term returns. While shares fell from highs of $40 in 2007 to lows of $10 in 2008, a strong recovery have been witnessed ever since. In a rather straight line, shares have risen to current levels around $100 per share.Underlying these returns has been a compounded annual growth rate of roughly 15% between 2004 and 2013. Over this time period, WEX has grown revenues from merely $189 million to $717 million in 2013. Earnings have grown rapidly as well as the company kept the outstanding shareholder base roughly equal over this time period.The company generates three quarters of its revenues from fleet cards accepted at over 90% of the fuel stations within the US and over 45,000 maintenance locations. Some 7.7 million cars have seen their fuel purchased for by WEX's cards.Focus From Fleet To Other AreasWEX saw its IPO back in 2005 when it was still very much focused on fleet solutions. It still is the #1 fleet card provider with a 15% market share within the US according to the company's investor presentation.Through its proprietary software it can control purchases in the field, allowing companies to achieve fuel discounts through collective purchasing while it provides valuable data for analysis which allows them to reduce operating costs. This business model is highly scalable and results in stable and high operational cash flows.Besides the focus on in fleet solutions, the company has focused on other areas to use its technology in order to achieve scale, security and analysis for customers including the market for travel, healthy and employees. This business now makes up roughly a quarter of sales, growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 48% between 2008 and 2013. This growth has been driven by numerous acquisitions including the announced Evolution1 deal.Implications For InvestorsAfter great momentum in recent years, shares of WEX have been trading flat so far this year. This is despite a temporarily correction witnessed with shares trading around $80 in February of this year.The company has deserved today's premium valuation given the strong track record of the firm, yet this does not automatically makes it a buy at current levels. Shares trade at roughly 22 times earnings as leverage will increase on the back of the new growth acquisition.Perhaps a re-test of that $80 level might be an interesting entry point for this steady but impressive growth story. At those levels investors are able to buy a steadily growing premium player which is posting solid profits at levels which trade at par with wider equity markets.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1693952,39011,2013-09-14T15:20:19-04:00,,"Overview and ThesisWEX Inc. (NYSE:WEX) provides payment solutions to various customers all over the world. It operates under two segments: Fleet Payments, which offers payment processing, account servicing and transaction processing to government and corporate clients, and Other Payments, which provides payment processing and transaction monitoring including single use accounts and prepaid cards. This segment primarily serves small and medium sized businesses as well as some government organizations. Shares are up modestly in the past year but since 2009, shares have risen roughly 800% on strong operating results and strategic acquisitions. The company's Other Payment segment is growing at a blistering pace but it is too small to carry the mid-to-low single-digit growth of the Fleet business. Rapidly expanding total sales and income have driven the stock higher over the past few years. However, on a valuation basis, I believe shares have gotten ahead of the company's ability to grow earnings and I'll argue here that WEX is simply too expensive to own at $84 for a variety of reasons.Earnings ModelBefore we take a look at WEX's business I believe it is instructive to understand what analysts think of the company's earnings prospects. I'll use these and other inputs in my earnings model, which you can read about in greater detail here, in order to compute a fair value for shares. My inputs and sources are as follows: 1) reported earnings, 2) earnings growth rates, 3) current book value and 4) current dividend, all from Yahoo! Finance, 5) perpetual growth rate of 3% and 6) discount rate of 9%, both of which are my numbers.At first glance, my model suggests there is roughly $14 of downside to WEX's current $84 share price, which I would classify as significant. However, I believe that a reasonable case can be made for this in that WEX shares have been rising more or less in a straight line since the bottom during the financial crisis and that the business has improved its metrics largely due to costly acquisitions. For a point of reference, in order to create a fair value to match today's selling price, an earnings growth rate of 18% is implied versus the ~14% analysts are currently calling for. While 18% may be reasonable the fact is that market participants are pricing in earnings beats before they happen so in the event they don't happen, shares will likely get punished. Ideally, you want the market's expectations to be lower than analysts to provide a margin of safety and some upside catalysts.The BusinessThe WEX business model is based upon providing payment solutions to organizations that don't want to manage it themselves. This is a terrific model as many companies have no interest in attempting to manage their fleet's payment needs and WEX is there to fill the gap. WEX can offer its clients a simple, one-stop shop solution to payment needs and also provides comprehensive reporting capabilities on the company's payment usages. For instance, WEX can provide its customers with very detailed reports about when, where, why and how much a particular card was used for by a particular driver. This offers the customer an unparalleled sense of security in knowing that fraud risk is greatly reduced. In addition, it's just easier not to have to deal with it for the customer. In that sense, the WEX model is very attractive to potential customers and I'm not surprised the company has very high retention rates among its customers.The Fleet business, which is about three-quarters of the company's total revenue, is designed to help companies that have fleets of vehicles on the road with payment needs. A good example of this business is what I just described above. Fleet has grown at about 5% per year, on average, over the last five years but that includes a massive decline in revenue from 2008 to 2009. The other quarter of the business is the fast growing Other Payments business, which offers corporate charge cards, prepaid cards and gift card services, etc. This segment has grown revenues at roughly 40% per year on average over the same time period but it still a relatively small piece of the business. In both cases, WEX derives the bulk of its revenue from payment processing with ancillary revenue from account servicing, finance charges and other peripheral items not core to the business.PositivesDespite my cautious tone there is a lot to like about the WEX model and the way the company is run. First off, the margins are huge. The company produces prodigious gross margins in the 75%+ area and operating margins of ~36%. This is tremendously impressive although it should be somewhat expected given that WEX is in a service business. Still, many service companies don't come anywhere close to WEX in terms of margin and management should be praised for building and maintaining such a ridiculously profitable business.Next, like a software producer or other type of service entity the model WEX uses is highly scalable. This means that WEX can go after incremental revenue with incurring commensurately higher costs to attain that revenue. Since WEX is a service business it can leverage existing personnel to a large extent in order to go after more customers and when that happens, margins tend to increase over time as SG&A expenditures are leveraged and become a smaller portion of net revenue. WEX has made its living from this kind of model and it is no doubt still working for them. There is a lot to be said about a business that is easily scalable and has tremendously high operating leverage and with WEX, you get both.ConcernsBased on the introduction you know I have some concerns about WEX and its valuation and we'll take a look at some of those now. First, the company's cash conversion is quite lengthy to me. When a customer initiates a transaction with a WEX card, WEX approves the transaction and then pays the merchant within 10 days. This is how WEX gets most of its revenue (from taking fees on these transactions) but WEX doesn't get paid back for up to 30 days or longer. While this works out very well for the customer it isn't great for WEX as it has to pay the bill within 10 days but doesn't get its money back for a month. This free financing is part of the value added for customers but it's expensive in terms of cash needs for WEX. While WEX has shown no inability to cover its cash needs this cycle is 180 degrees from what you'd draw up if you could dictate what happens.In addition to this, WEX faces stiff competition from several sources including Comdata and FleetCor. FleetCor competes more in the small fleet category that also has lower card usage rates. Thus, the market opportunity is lower here and WEX likely isn't overly worried about that category. However, there is ample competition in the more lucrative medium+ fleet and over the road categories as card usage rates tend to be much higher. These customers would be truck companies and governments with large car fleet usage, for instance. This is where WEX faces the toughest competition but it also represents the biggest opportunity. In fact, this is the reason WEX purchased Fleet One last year. While WEX is making progress it still faces plenty of competition and since it can be challenging to differentiate oneself in what can be perceived to be a commodity-like service, WEX has some work to do. While I believe WEX is good at what it does, it doesn't really matter what I think; it matters only what the customers think and it can be easy to assume all payment providers are providing essentially the same service, even if they aren't.Finally, the company's capital allocation policies have been a bit, aggressive, let's say. Over the past five years, WEX has spent roughly $800 million on acquisitions. Clearly, the modis operandi at WEX headquarters is to grow by acquisition. While this strategy has worked for many companies it has also sent many into the poorhouse along the lines of Sprint/Nextel or AOL/Time Warner. To be clear, I'm not suggesting WEX is headed down that road but what I am suggesting is that constantly acquiring companies is very, very expensive. Not only do you have to pay prodigious premiums in order to acquire the company but you've then got to integrate them into your company and hope that legacy customers don't flee. The point is that while growth-by-acquisition can work it is a challenging strategy to succeed with.We've seen some of the consequences of these acquisitions in the company's balance sheet. As of the last quarter WEX reported over a billion dollars in intangible assets, largely from acquisitions. This means that WEX has overpaid, then overpaid, then overpaid some more for its targets over the years. Now, when I say ""overpaid,"" I am referring to the fact that companies must pay more than the book value of the assets being purchased. I'm not commenting on the value gained from the deals I'm simply making the point that WEX has spent close to a billion dollars over and above the value of its acquired assets over the years. Acquiring companies is very, very expensive and WEX has been a prime example of that.In order to finance these acquisitions and fund the operations of its business WEX has borrowed somewhat heavily. The company's stated goal for total debt to EBITDA is 1.5x but as of the end of last year that number was 2.0. WEX has hit the 1.5 ratio in the past but then inevitably acquires somebody else and borrows to do so. The good news is that WEX has proven the ability to integrate its targets and pay down the debt eventually but the bad news is this debt isn't free. The balance sheet isn't a huge problem but WEX does have some leverage and I'd only use caution if we see the debt/EBITDA number creep over 2.5 and that would likely only happen upon another acquisition. Management is very smart so I don't think debt will get out of hand but it should be monitored closely.ConclusionWEX is a very well run company with intelligent management, a diverse customer base and enviable margins. The company has some potential headwinds to future growth including competition and its balance sheet. On the whole, WEX is a great company to own and shareholders have been rewarded over the past several years. However, even great businesses can be too expensive and that is what we see with WEX. Given the company's growth rates and the other factors I've discussed I think 17 times next year's earnings is likely a bit rich. Thus, my price target is $70, as my earnings model suggested, because that would be a more reasonable 14 times next year's earnings. The market may continue to value WEX at very high multiples but I suspect it will not last forever.Even if WEX doesn't experience multiple contraction I believe it will need to grow into its current multiple. Therefore, at current levels, upside is likely very limited. However, as I've discussed, I believe there is some risk of downside given that WEX is priced for perfection. WEX is a great company that runs its business very well but you shouldn't chase it into the $80s. Wait for a pullback into the low $70s before you get long as that will provide you with some margin of safety in case WEX doesn't continue to knock it out of the park. Besides, if you examine a long term chart you'll see that pullbacks, and sizeable ones at that, happen every so often so you'll get a chance to get in cheaper than today's prices.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

3565856,40921,2015-10-13T10:56:08-04:00,"Having declined substantially in price, shares of a high quality payment operator WEX Inc are now offered to investors at a fair price.Because WEX operates in the Business-to-Business arena, many investors are unaware of the company despite the attractive nature of the sector in which it operates.With a large and growing global payment network, WEX enjoys some of the same advantages as other more well known companies in the payments space such as Visa.Over the medium to long term, WEX has substantial opportunities to grow it's business through acquisitions.Compared to other companies in the space, WEX is offered at very cheap multiples, offering substantial relative value both currently and in the long term.","Gems in the WreckageTypically, opportunities to purchase companies that are the ""cream of the crop"" at fair or bargain prices are only afforded during periods of substantial market tumult. The chance to purchase a high quality company with the ability to retain and compound earnings over the long run is something that must never be taken for granted and whenever global markets are cast into a state of turmoil, investors that have a substantial cash position are often afforded the ability to take advantage of fire sale situations.Though these ""Wonderful Business"" type companies are almost always offered at substantial premiums to their assets due to the fact that they have the ability to generate significant returns on incremental amounts of capital employed, during periods of market agony, there is often the opportunity to pay a fair (or, very rarely, a bargain) price for a high quality business.I myself maintain a database of around fifty businesses that I would love to own at the right price. Though they are scattered across numerous industries and vary considerably size, they all have several common characteristics that include relatively high returns on equity, high interest coverage, a strong capital base (or, often, no debt), long term and meaningful growth in earnings and earnings power as well as a strong and expanding competitive advantage.One such business that is beginning to approach very attractive price levels is WEX Inc (NYSE:WEX). I believe that investors seeking the opportunity to purchase an attractive and high quality business will do well to closely examine WEX Inc in the coming weeks and months as the broader stock market enters into what appears to be a significant period of volatility. A classic ""toll bridge"" type of business, WEX helps to optimize and reduce the amount of money spent by employers on a variety of operating expenses, particularly those related to the maintenance and fueling of transportation fleets all the while collecting revenues associated with processing and financing these payments.What WEX Does(Quoted text courtesy of Google Finance)WEX operates primarily in two major sectors, the fleet payment sector which accounted for approximately 69% of revenues per the most recent annual report in addition to recently entering the Healthcare sector. ""The Company's Fleet Payment Solutions segment provides customers with fleet vehicle payment processing services for commercial and Government fleets. Its Other Payment Solutions segment comprises its virtual, healthcare, paycard and prepaid products.""On the surface, WEX Inc appears to be a dull, boring business. Something that should prove quite exiting to the right type of investor, myself included. As many readers will know, the payments sector has become an area of increasing interest for many companies of late with well known names including Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA) garnering renewed investor interest to relatively new companies such as Paypal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Square.Unlike many of these previously mentioned companies, WEX does not engage in consumer financing and instead the company's operations are restricted to the B2B sphere, meaning that few investors will encounter WEX or its products in their everyday lives unless they are actively involved in operating or managing a business that would be involved with WEX. For that reason, WEX does not advertise heavily and as such, the company remains largely ignored by the investing public at large. This obscurity is what helps to furnish a substantial opportunity for the investor with the patience required to both understand the company's business and the wait for an opportunity in the stock price.Despite this relative obscurity, WEX, Inc. performs an essential industrial function that enables greater efficiencies to be realized by its customers. Plainly stated, WEX provides credit cards for employees of businesses who are able to then use this card at WEX affiliated locations for a business expenses such as fuel, maintenance or expenditures related to health care spending. For many businesses, expense management represents one of the most critical and challenging facets of operation and for this reason there is always a strong market for a company or service that generates substantial savings from current operations. This is also doubly important because many of the expenses that WEX helps to manage, like fuel and healthcare, are facts of life and simply cannot be cut or outsourced and thus need to be managed.The use of a WEX Card (or related solution) enables companies to more efficiently track expenses incurred by their employees while being able to control and set limits upon employee expenditures in addition to reducing the reporting burden (i.e paperless data collection from WEX versus a stack of receipts from a driver that must be manually processed into the company database) on business owners. With an affiliated network of fuel retailers that the company estimates accounts for 90% of all fuel retailers in the United States and Australia (with a recent drive of expansion into Europe), WEX is able to leverage its scale to enable business owners to reduce operating expenses thorough optimizing their fuel consumption and the related needs of their fleet.The Numbers on WEXWith a market capitalization of $3.47 billion, WEX is a medium sized company that has a significant runway of growth ahead of it, Currently priced at $89.85 a share against a book value of $27.74, the company trades at a significant premium to it's assets - something that is to be expected when compared against other peers in the company's sector as well as WEX's above average profitability and growth potential all at an EBITDA multiple of slightly over 10. The company's current P/E ratio, standing at approximately at 20.4, is also above average, implying an Earnings Yield of slightly below 5%. The company is also strongly capitalized, with a current ratio of over 2.9.Though WEX does not pay a dividend, I believe this is of little consequence given the ability of the company to retain and compound earnings at a significant rate internally - something evidenced by the company's compounded annual return of over 40% since IPO in February 2005.When compared to the closest comparable company in the B2B payment and financing sector, Fleetcor Technologies (NYSE:FLT), WEX represents an asset that has a very similar RoA and RoE profile for the last full year of 2014 (RoA of 5.3% vs FLT's 5.85%, RoE of 20.6% vs. FLT's 18.45%) yet is priced on a P/E basis at a significant discount when compared to Fleetcor (21 vs Fleetcor's P/E of 34.48). A large portion of this discount is likely explainable by the significant advantages conferred to Fleetcor due to the company's greater scale, however I believe that investors are better served to purchase shares of WEX due to both the company's relative cheapness as well as the significant growth potential which is in the process of being realized.Attractive Growth Markets: Poised to Benefit From the Oil Shakeout and Healthcare ExpansionOne attribute that I believe makes WEX an attractive investment is the combination of mid-term and long-term tailwinds in several of the company's operating segments. The first major area that I believe represents an underappreciated opportunity for investors is the fact that large oil companies are increasingly likely to seek to divest assets as they grapple with controlling CapEx costs and stubbornly lower prices for the foreseeable future, leaving WEX well placed to benefit from any divestments pertinent to their business. WEX has engaged in such acquisitions before, with the closing of their acquisition of Exxon's European commercial fuel card program, providing the company with both a stronger in Europe and a critical enhancement of the company's global footprint.As more large oil companies seek to shed assets in order to streamline expenses, I believe that WEX is well positioned to benefit. Not only is the company in the right place to absorb a large wave of ""non-core"" divestments from major oil companies due to its global footprint and expanding network, the company is also the right size to absorb these transactions which will add meaningful earnings power to the company, particularly when compared to larger competitors such as Fleetcor. In situations where there is suddenly a large supply of acquisitions that will ""move the needle"" in a given sector, I find medium sized companies are much better positioned to take advantage of an acquisition trend (as has been the case with regional bank consolidation in the United States), with shareholders reaping the rewards in the form of significant and permanently increased earnings power.Another attractive area of business is the company's recent expansion into the Healthcare and transit account payment solutions area. The use of Health and Transportation savings accounts is on the rise due to the fact that the sums earmarked for these accounts are tax advantaged, which will encourage higher rates of adoption in the workforce as time goes on. WEX's recent acquisition of Evolution1, combined with the company's large pre-existing relationship network has the potential to lead to a meaningful amount of cross selling over a longer term. As WEX expands into new areas of business, the company will be able to both leverage its global scale as well as build its ""franchise value"" as being a full-service global operator in the B2B space, something that will eventually be significantly rewarded in the marketplace.Why Now: Attractive Industry Fundamentals, Deal Potential and a Market Sell-offI believe that WEX Inc is one of those companies that is both in the right place (the payments space) and is benefitting from being capable of taking the necessary action needed to achieve growth profitably at the right time. In the past several years, payment technology has advanced considerably either through the use of prepaid cards or electronic devices and the companies that are involved in the payment technology space are poised to benefit from significant tailwinds in the long run. In addition to these larger macro trends, WEX is also demonstrated that it is well positioned to make individual opportunistic acquisitions and is well suited to expand its service offerings outward.Nowhere is this benefit more easy to realize than in the fleet and healthcare payment space, two areas of business that are both inevitable expenses many companies must bear and control and two spaces in which innovation is growing at a significant pace (either through economic pressure to optimize or through legislative mandate). Any business or process which can reduce expenses in these sectors, something which WEX has excelled at since its founding, will be of growing importance in the business ecosystem as time progress.Given the size of the company, its profitability as well as the company's global network of partners and affiliates I also believe that it is very possible WEX might be acquired in the medium to long term - particularly given the company's relatively small size and low earnings multiples when compared to peers in the space. For a company already operating within the B2B payments sphere, the purchase of WEX provides immediate synergies through the merging of payment networks and clients.Another catalyst that I believe would be attractive in the medium term to long term would be the institution of a dividend. Though I believe that this outcome is not likely in the near term due to the significant opportunities available for WEX to conduct profitable acquisitions, I believe that a dividend would attract the attention of a wider investor base and help lift the stock from relative obscurity.RisksInvestors must be aware of the fact that despite the strength of the company's payment network and the essential nature of the service that it provides to clients, there are also significant potential risks to be aware of including disruption by nascent technological forces, increased competition as well as a lack of success in new areas of business.The first is that WEX operates in a space that is vulnerable to technological disruption, with highly sophisticated payment technology innovations such as card-less solutions, or block-chain style payment records potentially harming the company's competitive position. Another significant area of potential technological threat is the advent of self driving vehicles, which would reduce substantially or eliminate many operational aspects of fleet expense management.Like more well known payment vehicles, such as Visa and Mastercard, the long term competitive strength of WEX lies in the ability of the company to maintain and grow its network footprint. As is the case with more well known credit card companies, competition is an ongoing and fierce process. Should WEX lose market share or fail to match the pace of service and innovation of a competitor such as Fleetcor, the company runs the risk of both reduced earnings power and the threat of irrelevance.The company's entrance into the healthcare payments space is also something that investors must observe closely. While I am not against businesses expanding their operations into previously unknown areas, it is important to be aware of the fact that there is a significant risk of operational execution, particularly as healthcare spending through FSA and HSA accounts is a relatively new innovation.Conclusions: Watch this Quality Name and Wait for a Good Entry PointI believe that investors will benefit significantly from observing WEX, Inc over the near to medium term - particularly given the significant increase in volatility beginning to unfold in the global marketplace. Despite the fact that stock prices are falling, the underlying fundamentals of the industry within which WEX operates as well as the business itself are strong.Not only does the company benefit from adoption trends that embrace operational efficiency through advances in payment technologies, WEX is well placed to benefit from potential acquisitions within its core business of Fleet Management as well as recent expansion into the Healthcare space. In addition, recent turmoil in the oil markets has the potential to spark a wave of asset divestment from major oil companies, potentially allowing WEX to make significant acquisitions as major and supermajor oil concerns shed non-core assets and allowing the company to significantly increase both the size of its payment network and earnings power.I believe that shares of WEX Inc are attractive on a relative basis to investors focused on the space currently and I would personally become extremely interested in establishing a position around $81 dollars per share (or approximately 3x book value) for the company on the back of any significant market volatility going forward."
3096006,76785,2015-04-23T14:32:39-04:00,Legacy business is highly differentiated and entrenched with customers.Management's acquisitions in Healthcare and Travel provide revenue diversification.Company generates significant yearly top-line growth and great earnings quality.,"WEX (NYSE:WEX) is a corporate payments provider. The company's primary business is still its legacy Fleet Payment Solutions segment (69% of revenue), which gives customers a method of payment specifically designed and tailored for corporate customers with vehicle fleets, currently servicing over nine million vehicles (8.5% growth in 2014). This segment has worldwide reach, operating in the United States, Brazil, Australia, and through the acquisition of ExxonMobil's European commercial fleet card portfolio, the company now has European exposure as well.The company bills itself as providing both security and simplification for its business partners. Through this Fleet Payments segment, the firm offers a more detailed data breakdown based on data collected at the point of sale so that customers can track fuel use and driver behavior, run reports on a variety of data points, set restrictions on cards so that drivers can't improperly spend company funds, and even provide drivers details on which fuel stations nearby have the cheapest fuel prices. This variety of differentiated product offerings above and beyond the typical corporate credit card is a large value addition to WEX's customers. It isn't a surprise that total payment volume grew 6.5% from 2013 to 2014 (311 million transactions in 2014 versus 292 million in 2013).Through access to WEX bank, an owned subsidiary, the company has access to relatively cheap capital raised through depository accounts and extends credit to customers. To be clear, this is not a traditional bank in the usual sense; it is organized as an industrial bank, which is one that does not take deposits that can be withdrawn in the traditional sense through check or cash withdrawal. This is relatively commonplace for large publicly traded companies with finance wings - other examples of companies with industrial bank subsidiaries include American Express (NYSE:AXP) and Ford (NYSE:F). This does give the company earnings exposure to currency fluctuation - WEX Bank settles in currencies other than USD, and these currency fluctuations are marked to market. The impacts of quick moves in foreign currency did broadside management in 2014 as the company did comparatively little hedging compared to other companies. Management has made significant changes to this going into 2015.The fleet cards the company issues are non-revolving credit (non-interest bearing accounts, payment due in full in 30 days). This reduces credit risk for the company - 94% of the company's receivables were less than 30 days past due at the end of the most recent fiscal year.Like other payment processors, WEX benefits from a high degree of operational leverage as it continues to aggressively grow its business. With the fixed costs of the system now in place, any new customer/payment processing volume growth is going to be low cost, high margin and highly accretive to the company's bottom line.Other Payments and ServicesDiversification is the name of the game, and that is something that WEX has been improving on in recent years through acquisitions. 31% of revenue is now derived from this catch-all segment. It has expanded its offerings to compete directly with traditional corporate credit card offerings in the business travel segment for bookings towards hotel and airfare, providing much of the same granular data and extra security that makes the Fleet business so attractive to clients.WEX also operates in the traditionally cumbersome and administrative nightmare, the healthcare segment. The healthcare payment processing system has long been scorned by patients and investors alike, this industry is in dire need of process improvement and WEX is billing itself as part of the solution. To expand on this, in 2014, WEX announced that it had purchased Evolution1, a cloud-based technology and payments provider that serves the healthcare industry. This acquisition gives WEX access to Evolution1's portfolio supporting consumer-directed payments and reimbursements for care, FSA/HSA transactions, and defined contribution plans. Management is understandably excited about this big step into the healthcare space:Since 2009, the firm's revenue from this segment has grown at a 47% CAGR ($37M in 2009 to $255M in 2014), fueled by acquisitions and solid internal organic growth. Thus far, the company's move to diversify has been paying off in spades and is cash flow positive on its own legs.Revenue Growth and Cost ControlWEX has focused on aggressively growing the top line, blistering along with a 20% annual growth rate over the prior five-year period. Operating Expenses have largely moved at a similar pace as management balances investment within the company to match growth. For investors looking for a growth story that is actually generating solid cash earnings that can support growth rather than through secondary stock offerings or new debt issuance, you can't go wrong here.Fuel Risks and Operating LeverageManagement estimates that 37% of revenue in 2014 resulted from fees paid by fuel providers in which WEX is due a percentage of the total sale. Fuel use by commercial fleets is relatively inelastic - consumption does not change much during periods of low prices to periods of high prices, and commercial fleets usually can pass on some of the cost of fuel to their customers via higher initial sale prices or fuel surcharges. Given fuel prices remain weak at least in relation to recent history, 2015 may have tough comparables to prior years even with transaction growth. WEX used to hedge 60% of its revenue subject to fuel prices via derivatives, but this program was suspended late in 2014 due to low prices, keeping current derivatives intact. Management has essentially called a bottom on fuel cost for 2015, so investors should be keenly aware of the effects of this now unhedged uncertainty. By the time 2016 rolls around, only 20% of the company's fuel exposure will be hedged unless the company reinstates its hedging program. The collar on their existing derivatives have locked in 60% for most of 2015 in the $3.30/$3.40/gallon range.Source: WEX Investor PresentationAs of 2014, leverage stood at 3.6 times prior year's EBITDA, much higher than what the company has been. The company has historically held very little debt, but has expanded that to $1.35B over the past few years as the company made acquisitions. Management has guided that they expect to deleverage over the next year and the company does generate substantial cash flow, so I feel this risk to be of little wary to retail investors. Management has targeted 1.5-2.0x turns of leverage, so expect the company's free cash generation to go towards paying down recent acquisition costs over the coming years.ConclusionThe legacy fleet business is going to provide stable growth with high margins for quite some time, yielding plenty of cash for WEX to try to break into the Travel and Health markets that hold high potential. The company has long been a success and trades at a relative premium to the market (14.45x Enterprise Value/EBITDA, nearly 19 times 2016 earnings), which is a premium it deserves given the overall story of the stock. At $111/share, shares trade off their highs in the summer of 2014. Any reversion to around $100/share would mark an excellent buying opportunity with a high margin of safety for investors looking to get exposure to this company."

28668,20400,2007-03-05T04:13:44-05:00,,"Wright Express Corp. (WXS) is a South Portland, Maine based payment processing and information management firm catering to corporate and government U.S. vehicle fleets. WXS tracks detailed transaction information for its customers' fleets. The company gathers its information by tracking 180,000 fuel and vehicle maintenance locations. Formally a subsidiary of Cendant Corp., now Avis Budget Group (NASDAQ:CAR), WXS spun-off on February 15, 2005 and is now a constituent in the Clear Spin-Off Index [CLRSO], which is licensed for the EFT symbol (NYSEARCA:CSD). My firm publishes the index. Collecting data from over 90% of the nation's retail fuel locations and 45,000 vehicle maintenance locations, WXS is able to provide its customers with information that includes the amount of the expenditure, the identification of the driver and vehicle, the odometer reading, the identity of the fuel or vehicle maintenance provider and the items purchased. This allows fleets in both the commercial and government sectors to manage their vehicles and personnel effectively and control costs. The company is able to provide these services by issuing corporate charge cards along with a back-end processing tool.    The company is also expanding its service and customer base. In the beginning of last month, it announced a strategic partnership with Networkcar, a provider of wireless vehicle management. The two firms are to provide remote vehicle maintenance diagnostics and GPS vehicle location information to their customers. In terms of customers, WXS has a large client base, including a new 10 year contract with previous customer, ExxonMobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM). When analyzing its fundamental data, we can begin to see a clearer picture of the company's operations. With few true peers, I do not believe it is useful to provide peer group data on fundamentals for this firm. These numbers are strong for a firm in most any industry and were updated when the firm reported 02/7/07. Its operating margins are a solid 54.43%, while its gross margin is 89.47%. The company also provided a strong 48.81% return on equity [ROE] for its shareholders this year. Growth is also a factor in its success, with a 9.80 year over year quarterly revenue growth. As for valuation we want to provide some comparisons and choose the closest comp of the information and delivery services industry. WXS has a trailing twelve month price to earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.67, below the average of 19.81. It also has a price to book (P/B) value of 6.37, beating the 27.41 average for the same group. The combination of these data points standing alone, or compared to the information and delivery services industry, has led us to conclude that WXS is a great asset to the Clear Spin-Off ETF [CSD], with the potential to yield great returns.

1746372,24361,2013-10-15T13:46:42-04:00,,"It's getting a little disheartening to write up articles on solid companies with good prospects but demanding/rich valuations. But then that's not exactly a surprise given how strong the markets have been for some time now.That brings me to WEX (NYSE:WEX) - the latest entry on the ""keep an eye on this if it gets cheaper"" list. WEX has a very good business in its fleet card operations, and one where I believe there's still good growth prospects. Likewise, while the growth of virtual card business will bring overall margins down, the growth potential there is worth the margin compression in my opinion. It's really just a question of what you want to pay, as it is challenging (at best) to work up a scenario where WEX really looks like a cheap stock.Keeping Fleets RollingThere are something like 26 million trucks on the road these days (of which about 3.5 million are the heavy-duty Class 8 trucks), and they all need fuel to stay in operation. That's where WEX fits into the picture - WEX's fleet card business is a closed-loop card network that allows drivers to pay for fuel at around 90% of the retail fuel locations in the country, while also allowing fleet managers to better control their fuel costs (including unauthorized spending).Although this may sound like WEX competes with regular business/corporate credit cards, this is actually a charge card - clients pay the balance every month (or pay late fees). With that, the credit risk is quite small and WEX routinely has overall credit losses that are smaller than the quarter-to-quarter changes in credit losses for typical credit card issuers like Capital One (NYSE:COF) or Citi (NYSE:C).The way WEX's model works, the driver uses the card to pay for fuel, WEX approves the transaction, pays the retailer (typically in 10 days), and the collects from the cardholder (typically in 30 days or less). While WEX does charge late fees and service fees, the bulk of the revenue comes from keeping a small percentage of the transaction value amount. As this is a closed-loop system, WEX doesn't have to share fees with merchant acquirers or processors like Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).As these transactions revolve primarily around fueling (though there are vehicle maintenance/service aspects with some customers), WEX hedges its sensitivity to fuel prices through an ongoing hedging program.WEX believes that its target market consists of around 41 million vehicles (the prior number I used was just commercial trucks) across small, medium/large, and national commercial and government fleets. Assuming WEX has correctly identified/delineated its market, that suggests about 20% market share given the 7.4 million vehicles WEX covers with its direct (3.6 million), co-branded (1.6 million), and private label (2.2 million) card programs.WEX also estimates that it has about 60% market share in the large fleet category, where it competes mostly with EFS, Comdata (owned by Ceridian) and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) (Voyager). FleetCor (NYSE:FLT) is the primary rival in the small fleet (30 vehicles or lower), but companies like JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) and Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) also offer fleet card programs (though targeted more towards larger fleets). It's also worth noting that somewhere between 50% to 65% have no fleet card program, though this is weighted much more heavily towards the small fleet space. All told, success/growth in the larger dollar value markets (large/medium/national fleets) is mostly based on competitive takeaways, while growth in the small fleet market is more about winning business from companies that still use cash or non-specific corporate credit cards.Organic growth in this market has slowed, as same-client transaction growth was less than 1% in the second quarter. Some of this is due to the company's operating philosophy - FleetCor reports roughly twice as much per-transaction revenue and does so largely because it is more aggressive with late and overlimit fees and deals more with smaller fleets that have less bargaining power. WEX believes that its lower-fee, lower-margin model will be more successful over the long term due to higher satisfaction and retention rates, and the recent competitive win of CITGO from FleetCor would seem to support that argument.Virtual Cards Trade Margin For GrowthAnother quarter of WEX's business is the faster-growing virtual card business. This is a more heterogeneous business, and it includes single-use virtual MasterCard (NYSE:MA) payment programs used in travel transactions, as well as healthcare and paycard payment products.Most of this business is currently oriented to travel transactions, and Priceline.com (PCLN), Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), and Orbitz (OWWW) are significant customers. WEX should add Travelocity next year as that company implements a plan to use Expedia's technology platform. In healthcare, WEX works with both PaySpan and Alegeus, but this business has been slow to grow despite an enormous (tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars in addressable payments) market opportunity.The downside to the growth opportunities in virtual cards (including substantial international growth potential) is that it's a lower-margin business. WEX has to remit fees to MasterCard and intermediaries like Total System Services (NYSE:TSS), so the total percentage that WEX retains of each transaction is quite a bit smaller than in the fleet card business.The Bottom LineI like the business model WEX is pursuing; I believe the company's low-fee model will be vindicated and validated over time (with competitive customer takeaways) and I believe the fleet card business will continue to grow, albeit more from customer additions than same-customer revenue growth. Likewise, I think the virtual card business holds a lot of promise for value-additive growth, even if the margins are lower. I also like the company's recently-announced share buyback (though investors should note that the authorization extends through 2017).What I don't like is the valuation. Whether I use an ROE-based excess returns model, a more conventional ROE/ROA/ROCE and price/book value model, discounted cash flow, or even a PEG-based model, I struggle to produce a fair value outside of a range of about $70 to $77. Even allowing for WEX's better than average growth and strong credit quality, I just can't get to a place where the stock looks cheap. I'm not calling for the stock to decline and I'm not recommending anybody sell it. In fact, the chart looks pretty encouraging on a short-term basis. I'm a long-term investor, though, I'd rather focus more of my attention (and dollars) on names with less demanding valuations today.Disclosure: I am long JPM.

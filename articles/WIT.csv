4359462,105777,2020-07-20T16:39:07-04:00,"Wipro, an Indian IT major, has been a lagger but still a dependable performer.In the hope of reorganising underachieving business lines and stimulating growth, it has brought an experienced outsider to lead the organisation.Amidst the pandemic, the new management will need to be more cost-conscious while deepening growth in areas of high demand.As businesses everywhere get on with digital adjustments to the ‘new normal’, Wipro stands to benefit.","Inherently, Wipro Limited (WIT) is a business with stable quality earnings. The problem is that this has not always translated to vastly differentiated financial performance. The lack of earnings visibility at present may exacerbate investor disregard for the underlying business prospects. Granted it might not be the most exciting stock to own, we suggest that its sound balance sheet and relatively attractive valuation make it worth holding.In addition, recent organizational changes are positive as the new management affirms its reorientation toward more active growth. Structural changes underlying the new normal post COVID-19 - in areas such as consumer buying behavior, supply chain management, workplaces and cybersecurity - may boost Wipro's revenue generating potential.While we expect Wipro to continue delivering as the economic backdrop gradually improves, it is still early to say if the new leadership will be able to take full advantage of emerging opportunities and uplift the company's growth profile. Therefore, the stock is a hold till we see a fitting strategy formed and first tangible results from the same.In the last financial year ended March 31, Wipro increased its topline by 4.2% year-over-year; its primary IT Services segment inched up a smaller 1.7% due to the early effects of COVID-19 (which the company estimated at US$14-16 million, or 0.7-0.8% of total revenue). The segment, however, maintained a solid operating margin at 18.1%. Net income was up 8.0% year-over-year, and earnings per share 11.2%. (Average earnings of the Indian IT industry, by contrast, grew 5.8% over the same period.)Citing external uncertainty, Wipro, like many other businesses, is abstaining from providing earnings guidance. As expected, the latest quarter ended June 30 was even more subdued than the previous. Revenue expanded just 1.3% year-on-year, and the contribution of IT Services fell 5.7% (though with an intact operating margin). Net income for the quarter inched up 0.1% year-over-year, and earnings per share 5.7%.In the near-term, the company will rely on operational efficiencies to maintain profits. Its balance sheet remains strong, with a good cash generating capacity. This allows Wipro to continue mining for opportunities, with focus on digital and cloud services. In turn, this promises to feed into the new management's long-term agenda to prop up growth numbers to a healthier level.Wipro's Cash Position (2015-2020)Source: 10x Research based on data from Seeking AlphaRelative to a group of industry peers, Wipro has certainly been lagging but rarely was the worst performer of the batch. As the table below shows, the only growth metric for which the company placed last is Levered FCF which was explained by the pandemic triggered pressure on operating cash flows in FY2020. This presumably is temporary and adequately offset by Wipro's cash balances: its twelve-month trailing (TTM) current ratio is 2.40, and short-term assets exceed both short- and long-term liabilities.Growth Metrics (3-Year CAGR)*Companies ordered in terms of market size from largest to smallest.Source: 10x Research based on data from Seeking Alpha (except for Tata Consultancy Services)Profitability wise too, Wipro has been posting mediocre results at best; however, it has not strayed too far from the middle of the pack. It compares favorably on most twelve-month indicators relative to Capgemini (OTCPK:CGEMY), for example. The company also outperformed the Indian IT industry in terms of returns on equity and assets: industry median values stood at 12.8% and 7.8% respectively.Profitability Indicators (TTM)*Companies ordered in terms of market size from largest to smallest.Source: 10x Research based on data from Seeking Alpha (except for Tata Consultancy Services)Looking at comparative shareholder returns, we have noticed that historically Wipro has been disproportionately penalized for its subpar performance. Over the last five years, the stock returned the lowest rate of -23.3% among the peers; it hit a similar record over the past year with -19.3%. Whilst much of the investor disinterest was reasonably justified during the boom, we believe Wipro still deserved to be credited for its consistently positive performance.Total Shareholder Returns (1, 3 and 5-Year Periods)*Companies ordered in terms of market size from largest to smallest.Source: 10x Research based on data from Seeking Alpha (except for Tata Consultancy Services)Over the years, Wipro has been adding to margins albeit at modest rates. It is for this reason that its earnings are considered high quality by analyst consensus: Wipro's income from core operations reflects cash flow and is sustainable. By definition, this makes the company capable of influencing earnings in a desired way and achieving future projections in spite of external events - something that may very well manifest at this post-pandemic time.Unsurprisingly, performance is expected to dip in the near future but mostly in line with the larger industry and market indicators. Analysts are looking at a low 4.7% in annual earnings growth; return on equity is forecasted to decrease to 15.4% in three years' time from the current 17.5% versus the industry's forward rate of 12.8%.After going through four chief executives in the last decade, Wipro is now led by Thierry Delaporte, the first non-Indian CEO who assumed the post on July 6. We see why Wipro is excited about Delaporte. He came from Capgemini where he spent 25 years in various leadership roles, last as the Group COO. Another boon to his track record is the experience overseeing Capgemini India; notably, he successfully integrated iGATE which Capgemini bought in a large deal worth US$4 billion in 2015. Clearly, Delaporte is not a complete stranger to Indian IT; in fact, he possesses an intimate knowledge of the local workforce issues and is praised for his calm cultural sensibility.At Wipro, Delaporte has his job cut out for him. The company is banking on Delaporte's ability to drive transformative change as well as his far-reaching client relationships across the Western Hemisphere. Among other things, the new CEO should also be able to capitalize on Wipro's existing strength in Banking, Financial Services and Insurance (BFSI) vertical (the single largest component of IT Services revenue, at ~31% as of FY2020) given his past tenure as the head of Capgemini's Global Financial Services Strategic Business Unit.And yet, Delaporte is not the only fresh blood at Wipro: Chairman Rishad Premji took over the post less than a year ago. The new CEO's appointment was largely his idea as part of an agenda to revitalize the executive leadership.Value-Adding Tie-UpsOne way to turn Wipro's ailing business verticals around is to improve the distribution of its existing suite of solutions. In this pursuit, the company is starting a dedicated sales channel for products, services and intellectual property to be offered to end users through enterprise level partners with large customer networks, primarily in the US market. Given that digital transformation solutions are as relevant as ever, this is a clever initiative that should help the company widen its reach significantly without expending much in resources. The initial focus is on three mature items, out of 60 platforms in total:For these and more platforms in the future, Wipro is looking to recruit:At the same time, we like the company's focus on collaborative product innovation through partnerships that strategically extend its distributive power into specialized areas. Just in the last quarter, Wipro inked three separate agreements:Each of these joint initiatives should help Wipro tap previously unreachable channels of customer acquisition. They also strengthen Wipro's position vis-à-vis direct competitors in India.Novel Industry TailwindsThe maturing IT services industry is facing a short-term decline, possibly followed by moderate growth over the medium-to-long term. The global corporate IT spending is projected to decline by 8.1% this year according to Gartner. In particular, IT service firms with large client exposures to entertainment, air transport, oil & gas, hospitality & tourism are to take major hits. On the other hand, IT consultants that work with companies in healthcare, online retail, F&B and telecommunications may benefit from comparably stable demand as the said industries shift toward digitalization. Wipro specifically carries a diversified client portfolio with over 40% of its IT Services business coming from healthcare, manufacturing, technology and communication verticals.Geographically, Wipro's main business comes from the US which contributes over 55.2% to total revenue; this is followed by Europe at 25%. Both the regions are among the worst hit by COVID-19. According to IDC and Gartner, North America and Asia are the two largest IT markets globally, each constituting over 33% of the US$3.8 trillion industry. With the Asian economies growing at a faster pace and only 20% of Wipro's revenue coming from outside of Europe and America, the economic outlook suggests Wipro may register further declines in the near term.Certain areas of business, however, should receive a significant boost in the post-pandemic world given sweeping changes in consumer buying behavior, supply chain management, workplaces and cybersecurity. Each presents potential revenue generating opportunities for Wipro.Digitizing workspaces: More and more companies are adopting worker mobility solutions wherever possible. 84% of American companies are considering permanent remote work schemes when, just a year ago, only 25% of workers were reportedly working from home. This broad transition will require increased investments in digital workplace consulting, unified communication services and mobile enterprise solutions - for all of which Wipro possesses strong value offerings. Enterprise mobility solutions, for one, were already enjoying strong positive growth prior to COVID-19 with a forward CAGR of more than 16% between 2019 and 2025.In other burgeoning markets that require tailor-made solutions, Wipro's strength as an IT consultant comes to the fore:Cybersecurity: With a dramatic increase in work-from-home options, data integrity and security are becoming increasingly more complex to manage. A recent VMWare survey revealed that over 85% of CTOs felt their systems were vulnerable to cyber attacks. The global market for cybersecurity, currently estimated at US$159 billion, is expected to reach US$270 billion by 2027.Supply chain management: The pandemic has also amplified the emphasis on supply chains for transparency and integrity reasons. The supply chain and procurement industry was valued at US$15.9 billion in 2019 and is forecasted to grow to US$37.4 billion by 2027.Digital transformation: Social distancing measures are promoting the need for digital transformation. Globally, the market valued at US$284 billion in 2019 is poised to reach US$336 billion in 2020 and US$1.3 trillion by 2027.Within a limited historical paradigm, Wipro is priced conservatively at this time. The negative performance in the fiscal year ended March and the last June quarter is partly to blame. The change of leadership, first reported at the beginning of the year, may have caused anxiety in some investors.Historical Price Multiples: WiproSource: 10x Research based on data from Seeking AlphaIn contrast to industry peers, Wipro is positioned toward the lower end, with all of its valuation multiples below the sample mean. So from a strict comparative viewpoint, we see value in holding on to Wipro and foresee an eventual recovery in prices.Valuation Multiples: Global IT Consulting Peers*Companies ordered in terms of market size from largest to smallest.Source: 10x Research based on data from Seeking Alpha (except for Tata Consultancy Services)Of idiosyncratic risks, one is Wipro's spending on acquisitions. Although cash is not scarce, going forward it would be prudent for the management to be more selective with buyouts. In the four years under former CEO Abidali Neemuchwala, the company spent over US$1 billion in acquisition and restructuring moves. Some were gainful but even those took a long time to turn productive.Instead, Delaporte's first orders of the day should be to reorganize weaker industry segments (such as healthcare, energy and utilities) and rebuild market share where necessary. (In India, for example: last year, Wipro dropped one place becoming the fourth largest software exporter). He obviously recognizes the challenges but it remains to be seen how exactly he will execute the remedies:The intention to acquire Brazil's IVIA Serviços de Informática, a multisector IT solutions provider, announced last week looks to be a manifestation of Delaporte's expansionist strategy seeing that Wipro already has a sizable presence in Latin America.Naturally, the greatest external headwind for Wipro comes from weak markets due to COVID-19. The world is officially in recession, and subdued customer demand means firms will be redrawing budgets on technological investments. However, digital upgrades that can potentially bring down opex may still be a consideration for many companies.Wipro also has to contend with an increasingly competitive industry. For instance, with expansion into enterprise mobility solutions, it will have to vie for contracts against a greater number of competitors including behemoths such as AT&T, Verizon, Google, and Amazon.Furthermore, as the industry becomes increasingly commoditized, service prices are to experience more downward pressure. This is partly mitigated by established client relationships and high switching costs. And partnering with bigger players such as Microsoft and VMWare allows Wipro to leverage on their brand recognition.Based on Wipro's quality of earnings and flawless balance sheet that could qualify as defensive characteristics, we consider it a hold for current shareholders. Prospective buyers are advised to monitor the company for a better appreciation on the new leadership's transformative strategy."

Nonetheless, shares have appreciated quite significantly in recent months, likely reflecting the view that Wipro’s growth profile should improve in the medium term with a new management team in place. Although the focus appears to have shifted to absolute growth, I am concerned about the medium-term margin implications.Relative to its peers, I continue to expect below-average earnings growth, and therefore, I believe a discount to the Infosys multiple is fair. Hold.Growth in FQ2 was led by a pickup in volumes across new and existing customers, while the benefit from the reversal of supply-side issues was marginal. The robust deal pipeline means the FQ2 strength should sustain in FQ3 as well, underpinning the better-than-expected c. 1.5-3.5% Q/Q growth outlook (including c. 50bps inorganic benefit).Source: Wipro FQ2 Presentation SlidesOf its key verticals, the financial services sector is likely to be impacted in FQ3 due to furloughs, but management did still express optimism on the growth trajectory. The Consumer, Communication, and Manufacturing verticals are likely to maintain the growth momentum seen in FQ2, while Energy, Natural resources & Utilities (ENU) and Technology should return to growth in FQ3.Longer term, management sees accelerated growth driven by emerging technologies such as Cloud, IoT, and 5G and is positioning to capitalize on these trends. Amid digital transformation efforts at its enterprise clients, Wipro is equipped to handle both front-end (sales channels) and back-end needs (automation and AI to unlock efficiencies).EBIT margins continued its upward trajectory in FQ2, improving c. 80bp Q/Q, as higher employee utilization, lower sub-contracting and other costs offset headwinds from the USD/INR appreciation. By segment, the core IT services business underperformed, with EBIT margins (excluding State Run Enterprises) improving c. 20bp Q/Q to 19.2%. Encouragingly, voluntary attrition fell c. 200bps to 11.0% in FQ3 as Wipro hired c. 12k employees. It also added 97 new clients during the quarter.Source: Wipro FQ2 Presentation SlidesOn balance, Wipro’s current operating margins remain the lowest among the IT services large-caps, and with further pressure from salary hikes (Wipro is rolling out wage hikes in December) and promotions ahead, I am less upbeat on the margin outlook. Nonetheless, management is calling for near-term margins to be stable (but with an upward bias), with IT Services margins (excluding State Run Enterprises) guided at c. 19%.Wipro’s latest CEO’s proposed five-part strategy (Growth, Focus and Scale, Offerings, Talent, Simplification) was positive with regard to “absolute” growth initiatives. Key measures outlined include driving growth from existing accounts, expanding scale, partnerships, innovation, and simplifying the operating model. Coupled with a focus on next-gen services such as cloud, AI, Digital, IoT, and 5G, Wipro sees plenty of growth ahead.While promising on paper, I see little difference from the previous CEO’s four-pillar roadmap, which ultimately failed to bridge the gap with peers. Furthermore, Wipro will need to walk a tightrope on reviving growth without compromising on margins. Considering the aggressive cost cuts implemented recently, as well as the guided increase in wages, growth revival without a margin trade-off might be too difficult an ask.Disappointingly, the new CEO also did not offer any insights into how the company will go about simplifying the business model or sharpening its focus on sales. This is in stark contrast to the TCS strategy update, which clearly divided its verticals into c. 150 sub-units, successfully fostering innovation and propelling growth. It remains early days, however, and I would expect more details from the new management team down the line.As expected, Wipro announced an INR 95 billion (c. $1.3 billion) share buyback (excluding taxes and related-expenses; c. Rs116 billion including taxes and related expenses). This translates into c. 4% of the total paid-up equity share capital of the company. The majority stakeholder group will also participate in the proposed buyback. In aggregate, the latest buyback, coupled with the earlier buyback in fiscal 2020 and dividends, amounts to an over 80% payout over the fiscal 2020-2022 period, matching IT services peer INFY.Overall, I remain unconvinced about the sustainability of Wipro’s EBIT margin improvement in fiscal 2021, despite the aggressive staff and temporary cost cuts in prior quarters. Instead, I see continued moderation from c. 18% to c. 17% in the medium term, amid wage hikes and as the company invests in closing growth gaps.Following a steep rally in recent months, I believe the stock has limited upside ahead. I believe a discount to the Infosys multiple is justified on the lower return profile and uncertainty around the medium-term strategy. At current levels, I think Infosys offers better value to investors looking for exposure to the Indian IT services space.Data by YCharts"

        For Wipro, this is clearly an opportunity to differentiate itself on two competitive fronts, where such Digital opportunity does not exist.
        For Wipro, we envision anywhere between $120-$180 MM in revenue during the first full year (12 months) of implementation.","We rarely write separate articles on partnerships but this one is too valuable to leave without attention. It is good to know that such alliances still take place, despite the economic turbulence. Below is our take on the specifics and benefits of this partnership.Source: Company websiteWipro is the information technology and consulting company that sources a lot of talent from India. The IT Services business provides digital strategy advisory, customer centric design, technology consulting, re-engineering and maintenance, systems integration services, among others, in addition to R&D around hardware and software design. The IT Products segment offers third-party products, focused on IT system integration services. Among some products are computing and storage, as well as network solutions and enterprise information security.Nutanix offers an enterprise cloud platform that converges silos of server and storage into an integrated solution.

Acropolis includes its distributed storage fabric delivering enterprise-grade data management features, as well as a built-in hypervisor and an application mobility fabric enabling application placement. A US company, it also has extensive operations in EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Tariff risks: The trade threat is substantially tied to macro risks, which is mainly manifested via tariffs; hence, there is inevitable caution that companies have toward investments as a result.Technological risks: Failure along any step in the supply chain can lead not only to business slowdown, but to a branding risk, from which Wipro (and NTNX) may struggle to recover.Regulatory risks: The tech sector cannot escape these risks, particularly when it comes to cloud and SaaS models."

Wipro's portfolio includes system integration, IT consulting and digital strategy in a multinational setting. It is headquartered in Bangalore, in South India. The company is also the first Indian tech stock to revamp its appraisal system, giving more autonomy to its managers. The company is lunging forward by cutting deals with such global leaders as Tableau Software (NYSE:DATA), a business analytics software seller.Is Wipro really as impressive as it seems to be?The business intelligence market, in which Tableau specializes and Wipro has a particularly stellar record in, is expected to maintain a growth rate of 5.8% until 2019. With these factors in mind, it might seem that Wipro has an edge over its other Indian competitor, Infosys (NYSE:INFY), which has stagnated lately. One might assume not much could go wrong when a company is doing well with its ethical business policies, its collaborations with tech giants abroad and enjoys a forward-looking domestic economy.These assumptions are contrasted with looming political instability and a sense of intolerance in the country. These situations directly affect larger Indian companies such as Wipro, which often depend upon the central government's largess to move forward. Coupled with the murky situation of Indian politics and economy, there is also the question of the H1B visa, which is necessary for Indian companies to function profitably. With American politicians coming out against the H1B visas given to Indian companies, there are likely to be difficult times ahead for Indian software giants.The Indian scene and understanding repo cutsWhile the Indian government's union budget for 2016-17 has been welcomed by a number of players, it was also criticized for not being very business friendly. This, from a party that positions itself as a pro-business entity. The situation gets murkier, once you wade through the news headlines. The current right-wing party has tried to placate the business lobbies, yet has often found itself stuck in the middle of controversies. With the domestic situation not being stable, Indian companies who depend on regulatory authorities within the country are often left trying to figure out a way to just sustain themselves.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) key monetary policy rate, also known as the repo rate, is the guiding principle for lending to commercial banks. The RBI drastically reduced its repo rate last September, which was welcomed by the markets. Though the Indian economy is touted as a ""beacon of stability,"" the controversies and political instabilities often clash with the government's stated pro-business policies.The Indian government lends money to commercial banks, when they fall short of funds. When there is inflation, the government sets a repo rate to deter banks from withdrawing funds from the Reserve Bank of India, to handle inflation. The fact that the RBI has reduced the repo might suggest inflation levels are down too. However, this is not the case. The Indian currency is still trading around 67 rupees against the US dollar, something that is not going to be sustainable in the long term. In the same breath, Indian IT companies often find it difficult to procure American work visas for their employees, who often have to work onshore.Go slow over Wipro and other Indian tech giantsWith a market cap of $28.8 billion and a profit margin of almost 18%, Wipro does look impressive. The company also has a decent five-year average dividend yield of 1.29%, which suggests this stock might be overpriced. There has been a tendency to be bullish about Indian tech companies, especially after the current government came into power. However, this enthusiasm may be misplaced and investors might benefit from being cautious about investing in companies like Wipro, which in fact is performing quite well. One must also bear in mind that Indian software companies mostly depend on their American clients to remain profitable. Any changes made to existing H1B visa quotas will negatively affect these tech giants.In short, a cool attitude towards Wipro and its Indian peers may be warranted in the current economic and political scenarios both in India and abroad."

The latter is the more recent, and at the time the company traded at $12.65; it has declined sharply, but bounced back to the current level of $12.12 when it reported solid earnings in its quarterly results for Q3.Total revenues came out at $1.9 billion (6% YoY) and net income at $348 million (9% increase YoY). As good as that sounds, that kind of growth is actually significantly below the company's average growth rate (over the past 10 years) on both revenue, net income or EPS. The market doesn't seem to mind, as the shares went up on the quarterly report to 20x forward earnings estimates by analysts as tracked by Reuters.Don't get me wrong, I think there is a lot to like about Wipro and wrote so in my bearish article even:The problem is that the company isn't growing business at lightning speed at this point, and my concerns raised in that same article regarding the valuation of the stock are still intact even when considering the company did move forward.INFY PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsAs shown in the charts above, the company still trades pretty much on par with its peers, and the earnings report doesn't give me a strong reason to change my perspective that there are better risk/reward prospects than to buy Wipro at multiples of 20x earnings, 27x cash flow and 4x sales.Further, there is the significant event of the CFO leaving the business. A CFO exit can spell trouble, as I've observed quite a few times, but I don't think that's the case here. Suresh Senapaty is retiring after 35 years at the company, and he expressed he was ""forever grateful"" to the company on the earnings call, so there is no bad blood here:With this context, I think it's best to disregard the CFO exit as non-material to the investment case. My conclusion remains the stock is too expensive, even though the company has a track record of growth and high returns on capital."
2835316,25791,2015-01-21T02:56:54-05:00,,"Wipro Limited Sponsored ADR (NYSE:WIT) reports preliminary financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2014.Wipro reported an increase in revenue of 6% compared to the same quarter last year, led by its Healthcare and Life Sciences and Global Infrastructure businesses. Net income for the quarter rose 9% year-over-year, while IT Services revenue was up 3.7% in constant currency terms. Currency headwinds presented a challenge to the company in the quarter, and are a potential threat to performance going forward.This earnings release follows the earnings announcements from the following peers of Wipro Limited Sponsored ADR - Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) and Infosys Limited Sponsored ADR (NYSE:INFY).HighlightsThe table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income (See complete table at the end of this report):Market Share Versus ProfitsCompanies sometimes focus on market share at the expense of profits or earnings growth.Revenues TrendEarnings TrendWipro's change in revenue compared to the same period last year of 5.94% lagged its change in earnings, which was 8.37%. The company's performance this period suggests an effort to boost profitability. While this is good to a point, the fact that the company's revenue performance is lower than the average of the results announced to date by its peers does not bode well from a long-term market share perspective. Also, for comparison purposes, revenues changed by 0.64% and earnings by 3.13% compared to the immediate last quarter.Revenues vs EarningsEarnings Growth AnalysisThe company's earnings rose year-on-year. But this growth has not come as a result of improvement in gross margins or any cost control activities in its operations. Gross margins went from 33.47% to 34.89% for the same period last year, while operating margins (EBITDA margins) went from 22.31% to 23.00% over the same time frame.Gross Margin vs EBITDA MarginGross Margin TrendCompanies sometimes sacrifice improvements in revenues and margins in order to extend friendlier terms to customers and vendors. CapitalCube probes for such activity by comparing the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is possible that the company's performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply an accounting prop-up using the balance sheet.Gross Margin vs Working Capital DaysWipro Limited Sponsored ADR's decline in gross margins is compounded by issues on the balance sheet side. There has been deterioration in working capital levels. The company's working capital days have risen to 187.96 days from 154.28 days for the same period last year.Cash Versus Earnings - Sustainable Performance?WIT's year-on-year change in operating cash flow of 14.35% is better than its change in earnings. This suggests that the company might have been able to declare a higher earnings number. But, this change in operating cash flow is lower than the average of the results announced to date by its peer group.Operating Cash Flow Growth vs Earnings GrowthMarginsThe company's operating (EBIT) margins contracted from 20.24% to 19.27%. In spite of this, the company's earnings rose. This was influenced primarily by one-time items, which improved pretax margins from 23.36% to 23.56%.Pretax Margin vs EBIT MarginEPS Growth Versus Earnings GrowthWIT's year-on-year change in Earnings per Share (EPS) of 8.10% is less than its change in earnings of 8.37%. This lower EPS growth suggests a likely larger dilution in the company's shares this period. Moreover, the change in earnings is less than the average among the declared results thus far in its peer group suggesting that the company is losing ground in generating profits in this group.EPS Growth vs Earnings GrowthSupporting DataThe table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and other relevant metrics:Company ProfileWipro Ltd. is a global information technology, consulting and outsourcing company.

        Earnings per share increased 7.7% to $0.14.
        Revenue increased 4.5% to $1,902 million.
        IT Services revenue increased 9.5% to $1,781 million.
        The stock has responded by rising over 9.5%.","Wipro Limited (NYSE: WIT), one of the world's leading providers of information technology, software application development, consulting, and outsourcing, announced third quarter earnings on the morning of January 16 and its stock reacted by rising over 9.5% in the trading session that followed. Let's take a closer look at the results and the company's outlook going forward to determine if we should consider buying into this rally or if we should wait for it to subside.WIT data by YChartsBreaking It All DownHere's a chart of Wipro's third quarter earnings compared to its results in the same period a year ago, and a summary of the other most important statistics and updates from the report:Wipro's earnings per share increased 7.7% and its revenue increased 4.5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2014, driven by adjusted net income increasing 7% to $350 million and revenues increasing 9.5% to $1,781 million in its IT Services segment. On a very bullish note, the company achieved quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year revenue growth in every industry in which it offers IT services. Take a look at this chart of Wipro's constant currency revenue growth by industry compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and the third quarter of fiscal 2014:Wipro's gross profit decreased 0.2% to $587 million and its operating profit increased 0.8% to $381 million, as its gross margin contracted 140 basis points to 30.9% and its operating margin contracted 80 basis points to 20%. These weak results can be attributed to costs of sales increasing 6.7% and general and administrative expenses increasing 9.7%, both of which outpaced the company's 4.5% increase in revenue.For the quarter, Wipro generated $260 million in net cash provided by operating activities and invested just $20 million in capital expenditures in the third quarter, resulting in a bountiful $240 million of free cash flow. The company utilized this free cash, and the $1,735 million of cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet to begin the quarter, to pay out a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share and grow its hoard of cash and cash equivalents by 9.5% to $1,899 million.Lastly, Wipro provided its outlook for the fourth quarter ending on March 31, 2015, calling for revenues from its IT Services business to be in the range of $1,814 million-$1,850 million, an increase of 5.5%-7.6% from the $1,720 million reported in the year ago period.Should You Buy Into The Rally?Wipro is one of the world's leading providers of information technology and related services, and increased demand for its offerings, primarily its IT services, led it to a solid third quarter performance, including year-over-year growth in earnings per share, revenue, and operating profit, and its stock responded by rising over 9%.Even after the large post-earnings pop in Wipro's stock, I think it represents an interesting long-term investment opportunity, because it trades at favorable forward valuations. Take a look at this chart of analysts' earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2016 and 2017, and its stock's current price-to-earnings ratio based on these estimates:As the chart above shows, Wipro's stock trades at just 19.2 times fiscal 2016's earnings per share estimates and a mere 16.6 times 2017's estimates, both of which are very inexpensive compared to its five-year average price-to-earnings multiple of 22.1 and its trailing-twelve-months price-to-earnings multiple of 22. I think Wipro could consistently command a multiple of around 22, which would place its shares upwards of $13.80 by the conclusion of fiscal 2016 and upwards of $16.00 by the conclusion of fiscal 2017, representing upside of more than 13% and 32%, respectively, from current levels.Furthermore, Wipro has shown a dedication to maximizing shareholder value and pays a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per share, or $0.20 annually, giving its stock a healthy 1.7% yield at current levels. The company ended the third quarter with $84.84 million in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet and it generates ample free cash flow each quarter, so I think it will likely have enough cash on hand in fiscal 2015 to increase its dividend, announce a new share repurchase program, or maybe even do both.With all of this information in mind and following its stock's large rally, I think investors could consider initiating long-term positions in Wipro, but with the intention of adding to them on any weakness provided by the market in the weeks ahead."
2834266,23164,2015-01-21T16:48:50-05:00,Infosys is likely to outperform Wipro over the next 2-3 years on a consistent basis.Inorganic growth and innovation will help Infosys gain an edge over Wipro and also best the industry growth rate.I also expect Infosys to see margin expansion in the next 2-3 years as the company pitches for more innovation driven projects.Investors can consider fresh exposure to Infosys at current levels with the company likely to grow at a robust pace of 15% to 20% in the coming years.Investors alsocan  consider switching from Wipro to Infosys as the latter will outperform in terms of stock upside.,"Indian IT giants Infosys (NYSE:INFY) and Wipro (NYSE:WIT) posted stellar results for the third quarter of 2015 and both the stocks have surged after results. While the result analysis has already been done here at Seeking Alpha, this article discusses the reasons for preferring Infosys over Wipro considering a 2-3 year time horizon.The first reason to believe that Infosys will outperform Wipro in terms of stock upside is the current cash position for Infosys as compared to Wipro. As of December 2014, Infosys had a cash position of $5.5 billion as compared to Wipro's cash position of $3.2 billion.The cash position is very relevant in the discussion as cash will be the biggest growth driver for Infosys in the next 2-3 years. In order to elaborate my point, below are excerpts from Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka's comments -Before discussing the implications, I would like to add some more recent comments from Vishal Sikka -There are several important points to note here -With these points, I am certainly not suggesting that the story for Wipro is over. The company has strong fundamentals and I continue to believe that Wipro will deliver consistent growth in the coming years.However, on a relative basis, Infosys will beat Wipro in terms of revenue growth, margin expansion, innovation driven growth and inorganic growth. These factors will translate into greater stock upside for Infosys as compared to Wipro.Therefore, my view is that investors considering exposure to the Indian IT sector have Infosys as the best investment choice with a 2-3 year investment perspective. In my view, investors who have exposure to Wipro can consider switching from Wipro to Infosys in the coming months."
982621,24107,2012-11-06T11:41:42-05:00,,"By Joseph Hogue, CFAEven as many manufacturers bring operations back to the United States,  IT outsourcing is still doing well as evidenced by Wipro's (NYSE:WIT) earnings, out last week.  The company presented a positive report and outlook, a rarity for the  company of late, with a 24% increase in net income to $300 million on  a 17% jump in revenues over the same period last year.Investors cheered the news and sent the shares up almost 10% on  Thursday, although prices came down slightly with the rest of the market on  Friday. Even with the strong gains last week shares are down 16%  over the last year, although they have returned 12.6% annualized over the last  decade.The company is one of the largest global IT services firms and is  divided into three segments: Global IT Services, India and Asia IT  Services, and Consumer Care and Lighting. The company recently announced  plans to spin-off its non-IT-related segment  and focus on services, which account for 86% of revenue and 94% of  profits. The global market for IT services is expected to grow at an  annual rate of 4.5% through 2016.The shares now trade at 18.3 times trailing earnings, above peer  multiples of about 16.4 times. There may be some strong rationale for a  premium relative to the industry. The company’s operating margin of  17.5% is above 89% of peers, and the 21.6% return on equity is above 86%  of the industry.The bullish call on Wipro may come from the sluggish economy in the  United States. Companies are sitting on record stockpiles of cash, but  facing declining revenues for the first time in years. Much of the  upward momentum in asset prices over the recovery has been due to margin  expansion as companies cut their workforces and scale down to the most  cost-efficient business lines.The stable increase in jobs added up each month, but the lackluster  increase in revenues describes an environment where companies will need  to deeper for operational efficiency. This may very well come from  increased spending on information technology and services.Investors may want to hold off on the shares for a month or watch for  a pullback to multiples closer to the industry. The looming fear of a  fiscal cliff in the United States could spook investors and have  businesses holding off on expenditures. It is doubtful that the U.S.  will go over the cliff in 2013, but we may stumble over a small foothill of  fiscal contraction. Regardless, the demand for IT services and  outsourcing should grow and support Wipro into mid-2013."
1931141,48311,2014-01-06T18:50:21-05:00,,"In my original article on Wipro (NYSE:WIT), from May 1 2013, I made a case for investing in the company based on its fundamentally sound business model and the price gap between the company and its competitors. A possible catalyst to alert the market of the discrepancy in the company's valuation and that of its competitors was a recent spin-off of less profitable unrelated business. From the original article:At that time the company traded at a P/E of 16 versus the industry average P/E of 22.6. Today the company is trading at a P/E of 29 to the industry average of 16.3. At this valuation I routinely discover investment opportunities with better risk/reward profiles. The chart below shows the total return of Wipro vs the S&P 500 since publication of the last article.WIT Total Return Price data by YChartsCompany profile:Wipro was founded in 1945 and has become one of the world's largest IT services companies. It provides software and services to a multinational client base. They also have an IT product division which constitutes a much smaller portion of revenue, (about 15%) which sells a range of desktop computers, servers, and notebooks.The company used to have a consumer-care and lighting segment, that manufactured and sold products such as soaps, cooking oils, and lighting products in Indian and Asian markets. This part was spun-off.A few key observations:Two reasons to sellThere are two reasons I want to talk about selling Wipro for the time being. The first reason is that the original thesis for investment is no longer valid, after the company closed the industry P/E gap. The second, less important, reason is the build up of cash on the balance sheet.Comparing with Infosys and CognizantWipro is no longer trading at a discount compared to competitors like Infosys (NYSE:INFY) and Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH). The chart below shows the company's P/E development since the publication of my earlier article. Over the past few months its P/E ratio has increased faster than that of its close competitors.WIT PE Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsLast year I didn't standardize my valuations. This year I'm making an effort to standardize valuation across articles and will employ a discounted cash flow model. I based cash flow growth on the historical 10 year average. This is not entirely correct because the slow growing business has been divested since, however the company is now much bigger. Therefore growth will be harder to sustain.Then I projected cash flow growth rate between 3 and 7 years into the future. When projecting calculations 3 year into the future, Wipro shares have a net present value of just $6 but when you go as far out as 7 years, this goes up to $10+. True intrinsic value most likely lies somewhere in between.The second but less important reason thing that is starting to worry me is the growing mountain of cash on the balance sheet. In addition the company doesn't have a lot of debt. opening up the possibility to add leverage. It's possible the company will attempt a big acquisition and overpay. Although there are no indications of an acquisition, neither did the company promise more dividend or buybacks. If anything, shares are increasing in number.ConclusionWipro is a very interesting company with astounding growth prospects. It requires very little capital investments to fuel growth and in a favorable environment it can grow business at lightning speed.The value part of the original thesis is no longer intact. The company trades at a level exceeding my fair value estimated range by a fair amount. It also closed the P/E gap with competitors like Infosys and Cognizant, and the industry average P/E of 16,3. Actually, it trades at almost double that, instead of trading at a discount. There are options with a better risk/reward profile than Wipro at $12.65 at this time.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

315091,21568,2011-12-20T13:58:11-05:00,,"By Jeff St. JohnThere’s a pretty short list of IT services giants that are making a big name for themselves in the smart grid -- think IBM, Capgemini, Accenture (NYSE:ACN), Logica and the like. Wipro (NYSE:WIT), India’s IT outsourcing giant, wants to add its name to that list.It would appear to have a claim to the title. Wipro has utility projects underway in Europe, Asia, Australia and North America, ranging from bread-and-butter enterprise asset management and smart meter integration projects to building and selling smart meters into the European market and designing and building solar farms in India.It’s had U.K. utility National Grid as a client of its asset management services for more than a decade, and is building a private utility cloud for the utility’s OnStream gas and electric metering subsidiary. In the United States, Wipro is helping utilities deliver energy usage data to customer smartphones and iPads, Subbi Lakshmanan, vice president of industry practices for Wipro’s energy, natural resources and utilities business unit, told me in an interview last month.On the renewable energy front, the Bangalore-based IT giant is managing massive solar power plants in India and in the U.S. Southwest, according to Anand Padmanabhan, senior VP at Wipro’s utility unit. It’s also working on cloud computing models to deliver solar power management services, whether for solar farms or distributed solar rooftops, he said.These kinds of projects -- particularly its cloud computing platform efforts -- would appear to put Wipro in competition with the big boys of smart grid IT. Indeed, Wipro has been winning deals in head-to-head competition against the likes of IBM, Capgemini and Accenture, Padmanabhan said -- and it’s not just because Wipro’s services are cheaper.“It’s not just a story of India offshoring because it’s cost-effective,” he said. “Smart grid isn’t really about funds -- it’s about implementations and getting it right the first time.”On that front, Wipro can point to some experience. Utility and energy projects now make up about 13.5 percent of the company’s business, up from about eight percent last year, and that business is growing at an annual rate of 30 percent or so, he noted.That’s significant, considering that parent company Wipro Limited has 131,000 employees and clients across 54 countries and reported profits of $265 million on $1.9 billion in revenues in the most recent quarter ended Sept. 30.Still, there’s little doubt that Wipro -- along with Indian IT competitors such as Infosys (NYSE:INFY), HCL and TCS -- is hoping that its cost-competitive positions can help the company gain market share in smart grid IT along with its broader enterprise IT work.Wipro started targeting the green IT sector in a big way a few years ago, and has been pitching the value of “outsourcing smart grid” services at conferences over the last year. Projects includes smart meter integration for utilities in Nevada and Arizona and customer care and billing for Australian retail utilities like TruEnergy, among others.This integration work also touches a laundry list of smart grid partners. In Australia, Wipro is helping utility Origin Energy integrate Tendril Networks' demand response software into back-office software from SAP, for example. Its work for U.S. utility UGI involves integrating Oracle financial databases, and Wipro is also building a gateway for Oracle’s meter data management platform, Lakshmanan said.Wipro doesn’t build meter data management software to compete with the likes of Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), Aclara, Ecologic Analytics and eMeter (now being bought by Siemens). But it does have a line of business unusual for its IT-based competitors, Lakshmanan noted: “We’re also a hardware company,” building PCs and servers for Indian markets, as well as meters that it’s now selling into Europe under another brand.Lakshmanan wouldn’t give many more details about Wipro’s smart meter work, though he did say the company was interested in developing systems that could meet the technical specifications of some of Europe’s larger planned rollouts, such as France’s planned 35 million smart meter deployment.It will be interesting to see how Wipro applies its expertise to its home market. India’s smart grid market is projected to hit $1.9 billion by 2015, according to research firm Zpryme. Smart meters that can serve remote rural areas and protect against power theft in urban areas will be important -- and they’ll need to be cheaper than the smart meters being installed in the U.S. and Europe.Beyond that, India wants to add more and more green power to a grid that’s already struggling to deliver electricity to the majority of its citizens. IT outsourcing giant Infosys has a huge report on how IT can serve India’s smart grid needs (PDF).In particular, India could be a proving ground for distributed power generation and microgrid systems that can leapfrog ahead of inadequate central power delivery systems, much like cellphone service has leaped ahead of wireline telephone service there."
196525,20856,2010-03-31T15:57:51-04:00,,"As the US deals with stubbornly high unemployment and relatively low consumer confidence, some new trends are developing in the business of “outsourced services.” For some time now, large companies have relied on offshore companies to supply services such as technology support, customer service, and even more business critical functions such as R&D and manufacturing. Efficiencies gained from working with cheaper labor forces and relaxed regulations allowed businesses to post better margins.But today, many of these trends are shifting as US companies are benefiting from stimulus incentives aimed at encouraging employers to hire the swelling ranks of unemployed. Currently, employers who hire particular unemployed workers will be allowed to save their share of the Social Security tax (6.2%) for the remainder of 2010. The monetary benefit along with the PR boost of hiring American workers is causing many reputable companies to consider closing down outsourced solutions and “backsource” these jobs back to the US.While this is one of the smarter moves that the current administration has made (cutting taxes actually increases productivity and in time should lead to stronger, more stable tax revenue), the news is not exactly positive for outsourcing companies with operations in India, China, and other International centers.Today, we are going to look at Wipro Ltd. (WIT) which is an Indian provider of outsourced consulting, technology and R&D. The stock has become a favorite vehicle for swing traders and momentum players who have enjoyed a steady trend higher for the majority of 2009. During the difficult days of the credit crisis, WIT continued to pull in strong revenues, averaging between $1.3 and $1.4 billion in revenues. Fundamentally the business survived very well throughout the challenges.But 2010 looks to be a much more challenging year. Companies are demanding price concessions and the competitive factor of backsourcing is likely to cut into margins – possibly more than analysts are currently modeling. As technology solutions become cheaper domestically, Wipro is likely to face a more difficult environment, and engage in tough negotiations in order to land contracts.When the company reports fourth quarter earnings in the coming weeks, it will be extremely important to determine what demand trends are shifting as a result of global competition both from similar corporations as well as from the “insource” factor.Currently, WIT is trading at about 35 times this year’s expected earnings (the company’s fiscal year end is March 31) and earnings are expected to grow by 9% in fiscal 2011. The multiple is not too excessive for a company with stellar growth, but as earnings trends flatten out the market is more likely to place a lower multiple on the stock – leading to a reduced stock price.On March 17, WIT broke to a new high after a healthy looking two month base building process. However, the stock immediately came under distribution and the breakout failed. This is a dangerous pattern – especially for a stock that appears over-valued relative to its earnings and growth. Volume has yet to confirm the negative pattern, but if WIT begins to break, it may be a good candidate to short, and long positions should definitely be hedged or trimmed.Other stocks that may also face challenges from the backsourcing issue include Cognizant Tech Solutions (NASDAQ:CTSH) and Infosys Technologies (NYSE:INFY). All of these stocks are currently trading with strong positive momentum, but they are worth putting on a radar list for potential breakdowns in the future.Full Disclosure: Author does not have a position in WIT"

With a strong growing demand for well priced high quality health care service and rising unemployment rate, the outsourcing industry can benefit from playing an active part in the health care system restructuring.ABC News reported last November 2008 that “health policy experts say it may not be long before all Americans feel the impact of what is shaping up to be a national health care disaster”.  55 year old diabetic David Rushing lost his job. He used to pay $200 per month for his Blue Cross and Blue Shield health care plan through his employer. But after getting laid off, he had to pay $400 per month to keep the coverage through COBRA program which unfortunately expires in 18months.Wells Fargo senior economist Scott Anderson said that the worst is yet to come and estimated that 3 million Americans will lose their jobs this year.  In US, when employees lose their jobs, with it goes their health insurance coverage.This then calls for a real and comprehensive health care system restructuring where in individuals can still have access to quality medical care and services especially in times of financial crisis. The outsourcing industry has been known as the cost saving strategy. But it has also proven through time and experience that it also offers quality and not simply cost savings. It would be interesting what role outsourcing can play in the health sector given its more delicate premise, requirements and goals as compared to manufacturing, IT and financial sectors.Health Care Service Outsourcing in Philippines and IndiaCurrently in the Philippines, the business process outsourcing firms are only handling medical bill processing and medical transcription. Although in India, some outsourcing firms are already offering teleradiology and medical graphics services.Wipro Technologies (NYSE:WIT), an Indian outsourcing giant providing business, technology and process started a pilot project in 2004 offering teleradiology and medical graphics services to anonymous U.S. hospitals according to MSNBC.Altoona Hospital and other American hospitals believe that offshore outsourcing works even in medicine. Health services offshoring advocates said that there are no reasons to think that that this kind of partnership will turn the health service industry into a seedy sweatshop stealing US jobs and replacing them with cheap unqualified doctors. They emphasized that they only hire doctors who are U.S.-licensed and credentialed radiologist. Altoona Hospital for example outsource its teleradiology services to Teleradiology Solutions which is run by Dr. Arjun Kalyanpur,  a U.S.-licensed and credentialed radiologist with post graduate training at  Yale University.Outsourcing OpportunityThe home country hospital then sends the brain scan to the foreign partner hospital for interpretation. Due to shortage of radiologists in the US, Altoona Hospital sends the brain scan during emergencies at night and the doctors from Teleradiology Solutions in India interpret the scan.This is something the Philippine major hospitals like Makati Medical Center can also explore. Given the fast digitalization of Philippine hospitals and good supply of highly educated English speaking doctors and other medical practitioners, some even with international license, medical diagnosis outsourcing appears to be a good potential market for the Philippines to tap into. Medical tourism which is also a growing phenomenon is worth investing on.Disclosure: No positions"
128713,22394,2009-03-31T10:27:40-04:00,,"In the previous article, we had discussed using Infosys (NYSE:INFY) within a framework through which one could achieve returns entirely from dividends. In this article, we shall analyze the dividend track record of another software giant, Wipro (NYSE:WIT) through the same framework. Wipro is India's third-largest software services exporter and has diversified business interests which include software development, hardware and consumer care and lighting. The company began its swift transformation from a predominantly hardware company to a software services company in FY99. Since then, the contribution of Wipro Technologies, Wipro's IT services business, has been consistently on the rise and has been the major driver of revenue and profit growth.Wipro had been continuously paying dividends during the last 18 years. It managed to grow its dividend per share at a CAGR of 16% between the period FY91 and FY08. During the same period its earnings per share grew at a CAGR of 12%. If we look at the dividend payout ratio, there seems to be lot of inconsistency. This was mainly on account of the company’s string of pearls strategy wherein it executed many acquisitions. Thus between the period FY96 and FY03, a great deal of cash was diverted towards acquisitions, leaving little for paying dividends. Despite this, the average dividend payout ratio stood at 20% between FY91 and FY08. Given this track record, we believe that there is very little chance that the company will stop paying dividends to its shareholders in the near future. It should be also noted that the company has issued bonus shares five times and has also paid a special dividend during the last 18 years. This further reiterates our belief with regard to the management’s intentions of rewarding its shareholders. At its current price, Wipro's dividend yield is around 3%. Assuming that the company continues to grow its dividend per share at around 15%, the investor would be able to get a 10% return annually on his original investment from the ninth year of ownership onwards. This can be backed by the fact that Wipro has minimal capital expenditure. Moreover the company had a cash balance of around Rs 40bn at the end of December 2008. Conclusion: Despite the low current yield, the company’s strong cash reserves and sustained growth are likely to make Wipro a dividend earnings source for long term investors. In fact, it is likely to become a dividend tortoise, slowly and steadily racing towards the 10% mark. However, investors should bear in mind that the desired returns can be achieved only if one stays invested in the company with a long term perspective. Also, it is important that management policies and environment in which the company operates remain unchanged - highly unlikely over the long haul."
1120091,24107,2013-01-18T10:31:07-05:00,,"By Sean GearyIndian information technology firm Wipro (NYSE:WIT) reported results overnight. Although the company beat analysts'  estimates, the stock traded poorly in Mumbai trading. Is now the time to  buy this emerging market stock?In its quarterly report, Wipro -- India's third-largest IT firm -- announced that consolidated earnings grew at 6.57% sequentially and 17.85% on year-on-year basis to Rs 17.16 billion. While these numbers are substantially better than the Rs 16.33  billion that analysts had expected, these numbers in and of themselves  do not paint the whole picture.Shares in the Indian IT outfit dropped substantially in India as the result of sub-par guidance.  The company has predicted growth to be over a wide range, from 0.5%-3%.  Growth at the low end of this range would be rather underwhelming for an  emerging market stock.An analyst at Religare Capital, Rumit Dugar, indicated that Wipro's  guidance ""suggests that volume outlook is uncertain,"" and that he sees ""limited room for EPS upgrades on the stock."" This unclear guidance could be a result of uncertainty in developed markets, with outlook from Europe remaining muddled.Traders were largely in agreement with analyst sentiment; Wipro dropped roughly 8% in Friday trading.If the developed world were to return to normalized growth over the  next few months, it stands to reason that a rising tide will lift all  ships. However, were such growth not to materialize, it becomes harder  to make a case for going long Wipro here.With its near-term outlook mediocre, and given that this relatively  low-beta stock was up 15% this month before its earnings flop, it's not  unreasonable to expect Wipro to enter a new downtrend over the  short term. With a forward price-to-earnings ratio larger than  competitor Infosys (NYSE:INFY),  which did not drop precipitously after it reported earnings, traders  should not be surprised to see Wipro slump over the next few trading  sessions."
171143,22321,2009-11-04T09:53:32-05:00,,"Wipro (NYSE:WIT) is a good company.  For some reason it has never quite caught investor interest in the way that Infosys (NYSE:INFY) has.  Azim Premji is a formidable leader; he has a great track record and is well respected in India.  On stewardship quality WIT is INFY's equal; but on valuation WIT is the winner.  Access The Quant Report here for data based on which below commentary is based.Operating RiskWIT has low levels of operating risk.  Between 31 March 2000 (fiscal 2000) and 31 March 2009, the company has delivered annualized earnings growth of 31.7%; the dividend has grown an annualized rate of 62.7%.  Including estimates for the year ended 31 March 2010, the annualized growth rates are 29.6% and 61.4% for earnings and dividends respectively.  The six year median earnings levels between the year ended 31 March 2005 and 2009 has grown at 28.7% annualized and growth in six year median earnings at the end of 31 March 2010 is expected to clock in at 27.6%.  WIT is cyclical and strongly influenced by the economic cycle - the annual rate of earnings growth (year on year) was huge during fiscals 2005 (57.9%) and 2007 (38.5%); during fiscals 2006/08/09/10, growth has been subdued at 23.7%, 12.3%, 19.4% and 12.8% respectively.  Its cyclical nature will create good entry opportunities and good exit opportunities as it dances to the song of the economic cycle.  Normally the IT sector will tend to outperform off bear market bottoms about 6 to 12 months before a typical recession end.  After the recession ends, IT will normally under-perform for 18 months or so before returning to an outperform phase.  We are presently headed for a period when IT can be expected to under-perform.  Within the IT sector; IT consulting services and communication (networking equipment) services can be expected to perform well ahead of the broad IT sector.  For WIT, this could mean a period of holding a core position bought earlier in the cycle and should the stock under-perform, slowly adding speculative (short term) positions to benefit from further out-performance later in the economic cycle.Future Growth PotentialAll told, I believe Wipro has put in a solid long term performance; do note that the slowest year on year growth was 12.3%.  As regards the future, I believe WIT can return to 20% year on year growth, however, in the aftermath of the crisis, a stronger Rs, increased competition resulting in margin pressure and slower demand growth might lead to slower growth.  In my view 12% as a long term rate over the next several years is achievable with little to no risk.  Growth does not just happen; it takes effort and hard work – and the cost of this effort can be seen in historic financials.  WIT has increased operating cash flow at rates of 24.7% between fiscal 2000 and 2009.  During the same period investing cash flows have grown at 33.9%; and yes estimated free cash flow too has grown at about 15.7%.  In my view, the payout from investment in growth will show in forward years.Creation & Return of shareholder valueThe growth in earnings and core long term earnings potential has been phenomenal for WIT.  Dividend growth has been delivered at exceptionally high rates.  Payout ratio has run at median levels of 18% to 20%; this level of payout is fully acceptable when you consider the need for investment in future growth.  All in all WIT has done a great job in value creation and return.What is disappointing is that a long term investor, who purchased shares at annual average prices during fiscal 2000 and diligently re-invested dividends in shares, would have made an annualized return of just 5.6%.  Sadly, this is more a cause of bubble valuations early in the decade than any deeply distressed valuation today.  This is a perfect example of why I tend to avoid Rs/$ cost average investing strategies; my strategy is and always will be to buy value; even deep value.  Financial RiskGrowth requires investment and investment needs cash.  A company’s capital structure indicates how the cash is raised. What part of it is equity, what part of it is debt and what part of it is hybrid (debt with characteristics of equity or vice versa).The Modigliani-Miller theorem says that the value of a levered company is equal to the value of an unlevered company plus the marginal rate of tax multiplied by the market value of debt.  Simply put, if a company borrows money as part of its capital structure, it will be worth more than if it finances its capital structure 100% equity.  The rational is simple, when you borrow, you pay interest; this is tax deductible.  The dividend on equity is not.  Thus the market value of a levered company must be higher.  In numbers it works like this; if you buy an asset for 100 and expect it to generate 10 (14.29 pre-tax) in post tax cash flow in perpetuity, and the cost of equity is 8%, the future value of cash flows is 125; this is your market value.  This assumes a tax rate of 30%.Now if you have a tax rate of 30% and you borrow 30 at 10% and use 70 from equity costing 8% the picture changes.  You now have post tax cash flow in perpetuity of 7.9 (14.29 pre tax cash flow, minus 3 in interest charges and minus 3.39 in tax).  At an 8% cost of equity, this is worth 98.75.  And the debt is worth 30 (3 in perpetual interest cash flow with a 10% cost of debt); so the total worth is 128.75 compared with 125 previously.  For the equity holder, in an unlevered company 100 is worth 125 (Market Value to Book Value of 1.25); in a levered company 70 is worth 98.75 (Market Value to Book Value of 1.41).  So you can see that leverage is an important tool to create shareholder value.The problem with the words of wisdom of Messrs Modigliani & Miller is that their wisdom is often not understood or misused.  In the real world, debt holders want their money back; your operating cash flows need to be sufficient to pay back both the interest and principal.  You can replace debt by borrowing as you pay down debt, but the cost of debt changes as the economy transitions through its cycle.  In addition, during times when the yield curve is inverted and risk aversion is at high levels, access to debt might be very constrained.  At the same time, earnings and operating cash are volatile over the course of an economic cycle.  This acceptance of volatility is one reason why equity investors demand a higher return expectation compared with debt providers; volatility implies risk and risk demands a return premium.  Debt is a two edged sword.  Using debt enhances shareholder value, but using too much debt can cause future dilutive events which will destroy shareholder value.WIT has a strong unleveraged balance sheet; net of cash and cash equivalents at end of fiscal 2009 the company was unleveraged.  In my view, there is potential to add leverage and acquire growth.  In the unlikely event that M&A activity is not on WIT’s mind, adding leverage to a 20% of debt plus equity level is fairly safe even in the present climate; it can enhance shareholder value.  The funds raised could be returned via dividends, buybacks or a combination of the two.Economic RiskIn my view, the economy has recently entered an early phase of expansion.  While the expansion might be less robust than bull predict and the next contraction may be harsher than the bears expect remains to be seen.  What I do see is an expansion commencing, and one that is good for at least six months.  The signs for reversal will be watched for, but personally, I expect signs of trouble to emerge no earlier than 2012; of course I could be wrong.WIT is considered a large cap in India which is its principal market of trade; this adds a touch of defense.  WIT is a cyclical stock; the earnings volatility adds a level of risk.  This brings me to valuation risk, which is high for long term buy and hold investors but possibly low for speculators.  Financial risk is low as a result of a strong balance sheet.  But keep a watchful eye on news flows and M&A activity; the strength of a balance sheet can quickly change and since Indian companies do not include balance sheets in their quarterly reporting, investors do not always have good visibility on leverage until the year end. This brings me to valuation risk.Valuation RiskWipro trades at near Rs 600 per share.  In my view, fair value of the share is near Rs 300.  Let’s be clear, my fair value calculation is based on an adjusted version of Gordon’s Dividend Growth Model.  I use 6 year median EPS as a base long term earnings.  I use a notional payout ratio of 40% as reflecting the notional dividend; if the actual payout is lower, it’s not a problem because the lower payout will drive future growth higher than growth rates assumed in my calculation.  The future notional dividend flows together with growth in notional dividends at a rate equaling the forward nominal GDP growth expectations (12% for India), are discounted back to today at rates equaling a slight premium the long term return (16% for India) on the main market of trade.  This discounted value is fair value; fair value is a level where markets rarely trade; but when they do, it is time for long term investors to consider buying. The share price is marginally above forward fair value expectation (Rs 500) projected out to 2014.  So I cannot call WIT a buy on valuation for long term investors.However, persons who trade can take speculative positions for the upside potential left in this economic cycle.  In my view, over the course of economic cycle, the stock has a potential price target of Rs 1,500.  Over 12 months, the gain potential is in my view to Rs 900 levels; keep in mind that while IT can be expected to under-perform, IT services can benefit coming out of the crisis.  In addition WIT’s recent quarterly report was both strong on performance and outlook.In US WIT is trading at $17.36 in US and Rs 595 in India.  With the Rs at near 47 to $1; the ADR trades at a big premium to India.  The premium is abnormal even when considering other Indian ADR’s listed in US.  I have little conviction in this premium as I believe it would have disappeared in a blink by arbitrageurs; yet WIT has maintained a high premium for several years.Disclosure:  Long indirect positions in WIT, with intent to add small speculative positions at Rs 560."
123144,20521,2009-02-27T05:49:35-05:00,,"Even as the economic headwinds approach gale force, the Indian IT outsourcing industry continues to deal with the aftermath of the Satyam fraud revealed earlier this year. Amid such worries, Wipro Ltd (NYSE:WIT), another Indian giant and one of my Top 10 Outsourcing Stocks, announced rather depressing Q3 results.Revenue of $1.1 billion declined 0.9% over the year. In constant currency, revenue grew 3.5%. EPS of $0.13 was marginally shy of the Street’s estimates of $0.14. In Europe, there was good growth of 24% on a constant currency basis over the year. The India and Middle East businesses grew 52% in constant currency over the year.During the quarter, Wipro announced the acquisition of Citi Technology Services Ltd., Citigroup’s in-house IT services provider in India, for $127 million. As part of the transaction, Wipro and Citi will enter into an agreement for the delivery of Technology Infrastructure services and Application Development and Maintenance services for a period of six years, guaranteeing revenues of $500 million over the term.Wipro’s management foresees three major drivers of growth in a depressed economy. First, the company expects customers to look for an end-to-end service provider to help reduce overhead and the cost of managing relationships. The company is well placed to tackle this on account of its wide service portfolio spanning consulting, application development and maintenance, R&D engineering, technology infrastructure services, package implementation, testing services and business process outsourcing.Second, the company expects customers to look for partners who can address their capital conservation needs and reduce operating expenses. Wipro is capable of addressing the issue through its services of process optimization, application optimization and infrastructure consolidation. Third, the company expects customers to look for partners who are financially strong and sustainable. Wipro should be able to win the battle on that ground as well.Despite the above analysis Wipro seems to have done on potential customers, the company is still lacking in differentiated products or services that have any IP strength. With Obama leading the government, outsourcing jobs from the U.S to other countries may become more difficult. The Obama administration is clearly showing signs of using tax policy to prevent outsourcing to the extent they can. Add to that the annual salary increments that Indian firms have been doling out, and the Indian outsourcing industry is in some danger. To be fair, the salary hikes have slowed down under the recession scenario.The sad part is that not only Wipro is turning a blind eye to either product development or SaaS, but it’s the entire Indian software industry, as well. Its current outlook makes me repeat that the Indian software industry needs to diversify into other areas such as SaaS, Enterprise 3.0 and Web 3.0 if it really wants to play in the big league.If you are interested in understanding India’s innovation ecosystem, please read, India’s Innovation Gap, this discussion on Entrepreneurship in India and a discussion on the gap in product management capabilities. Together, they offer a picture of India’s stalling innovation eco-system, as the outsourcing industry is maturing, and to an extent slowing down.At the time of writing, Wipro’s stock was trading at $6.04 with a market cap of $8.79 billion. The company can still play a leadership role in building/acquiring a portfolio of SaaS or software product businesses. However, it needs to think differently, in order to get there.Disclosure: None"

Currently Wipro trades at a forward P/E of 16, which is 6-7 below the industry standard.Once the market realizes part of Wipro's growth is already realized with the new clients they contracted, and the slimmed down business is growing at a new faster rate, (because of the divestiture of the slower growing consumer product business) I can see the shares gaining ground and trading at more typical levels.Wipro was founded in 1945 and has grown to become one of the world's largest IT services providers. They provide software and services to a multinational client base. They also have an IT product division which constitutes a much smaller portion of revenue, (about 15%) which sells a range of desktop computers, servers, and notebooks.They used to have a consumer-care and lighting segment, that manufactured and sold products such as soaps, cooking oils, and lighting products in Indian and Asian markets.These are the details of the spin off as they were reported in the India Times:Favorable circumstances:Wipro Announced New ClientsWipro has secured a contract from a large Europe-based universal bank to build a ""Centralized Testing Unit"" that will help the bank achieve higher production stability and lower cost of avoidance in its Testing processes. Wipro's Transformation Services and Data Obfuscation Services along with industry leading testing services will help the bank achieve standardized Testing processes across the organization.GVK-led Mumbai International Airport Pvt. Ltd. [MIAL], the operator of the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport [CSIA] in Mumbai has chosen Wipro to provide world-class IT services for the new integrated terminal ""T2"". Wipro will be responsible for providing Managed Services across the entire IT landscape at MIAL and deliver high availability and operational efficiency across all the critical airport processes.Wipro has won an ERP deal for Asset and Infrastructure Management from a key national defense organization.The deals were released to the press by the company.RisksA few of the risks and uncertainties that Wipro faces:ValuationThe company is trading at a forward P/E of roughly 16. Not a true bargain, but 1.5 billion on the balance sheet and an estimated double digit growth rate going forward goes a long way. I particularly like that some of that growth has been realized already given the new clients they acquired.The industry average is at a forward P/E of 22,6. Perhaps this gap can be closed, now the company is a true IT service provider instead of a mixed bag of businesses. In addition they are less reliant on the telecom sector, with a client base that is more diversified across sectors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

87074,20480,2008-07-25T10:26:21-04:00,,"Excerpts from Gilford Securities analyst Ashish R. Thadhani's recent note to clients on Wipro Limited (NYSE:WIT):• • •Investment Conclusion. Based on a more cautious revenue outlook and significant non-operating adjustments (interest income and tax- rate) – mitigated by better near-term operating profitability – we are reducing our estimates as follows: fiscal 2009 EPADS to $0.59 on revenue of $6.056 billion (22% YoY growth) from $0.60 on revenue of $6.177 billion; and fiscal 2010 EPADS to $0.70 on revenue of $7.418 billion (23% YoY growth) from $0.73 on revenue of $7.686 billion. Our estimates imply 24%/11% compound revenue/EPS growth in calendar 2007-09 – after factoring a one-year extension in the “STPI” tax holiday to March 2010.Recent price weakness can be attributed to subdued guidance and renewed concern over the U.S. IT spending environment (59.8% of revenue). Nonetheless, we are maintaining our $14.50 target price. In 12-months, this would correspond to 20x forward EPS of $0.72 – a premium to the current valuation (18x). While recent deterioration in the macro environment does present short-term challenges, we believe that this scenario could also serve to accelerate offshoring initiatives.1Q09 Results. EPADS of $0.13 vs. $0.12 a year ago on revenue of $1.389 billion (35% YoY growth) matched our $0.13 estimate on revenue of $1.379 billion. Results included a sizable $16 million net currency translation/hedging loss (-0.9 cent EPS impact) and a higher- than-projected tax-rate. Still, operating income rose 35% YoY and exceeded our estimate by 8%. Highlights included 3.5% QoQ organic revenue growth in the IT Services segment (based on realized and not quarter-end exchange rates); resilient growth in the U.S. region (+4.2% QoQ and +36% YoY) and Financial Services segment (+5.6% QoQ and +47% YoY); improved operating metrics such as price realizations (+5% YoY attributed to performance on fixed-price projects and non- linear initiatives) and employee attrition (-350 bps YoY); and aggregate TCV of ~$500 million that should enhance intermediate-term visibility, including three wins in the $50-100 million category.Takeaways. Wipro noted significant economic uncertainty and ongoing turmoil in the Financial Services segment while providing 2Q09 IT services revenue guidance of 2.0% QoQ and 27% YoY growth; uninterrupted activity for “business-as-usual” work (55-60% of revenue), client circumspection on discretionary projects (20%) and greater receptiveness toward cost rationalization and transformational initiatives; a better outlook for 2H09 vs. 1H09 driven by ramp-up of recent wins and a healthy deal pipeline; stable pricing with increased interest in outcome-based models (six clients); and likely moderation of annual offshore salary increases to 8-9% vs. 12-13% in prior years.Revenue at the core Services segment advanced 35% YoY to $1.039 billion but fell short of our $1.058 million estimate due to a currency distortion. Growth was driven by the Infrastructure Management practice (76% YoY), Manufacturing & Healthcare vertical (48%) and non-U.S./European regions (60%). Operating income of $228.0 million (16.4% margin) surpassed our $211.2 million estimate (15.3% margin) driven by a higher margin in the Services segment. Profitability on a QoQ basis was hurt by seasonal visa expenses and a new RSU program (50 bps). In the reclassified IT Services segment, operating margin dropped slightly to 19.3% from 19.5% a year ago. Near-term, Wipro expects a stable operating margin in spite of annual offshore salary increases in 2Q09. Available levers for offsetting annual wage pressure comprise pricing, employee/offshore-mix, utilization and acquisition performance.Hourly price realizations averaged $70.12 for onsite work (up 3.9% QoQ and 5.4% YoY) and $23.79 for offshore (up 3.0% QoQ and 4.5% YoY). Billed volume rose 2.2% QoQ and 24% YoY. Utilization (excluding trainees) stood at 78.3% vs. 75.2% a year ago. Higher-margin offshore work contributed 46.1% of service revenue vs. 45.8% in the March quarter. Global headcount rose just 0.1% QoQ and 16% YoY to 95,675 in June. Attrition improved to 16.6% from 20.1% a year ago.By vertical, Technology, Media & Telecom ranked largest (31% of IT Services revenue), followed by Financial Services (25%), Manufacturing & Healthcare (19%), Retail & Transportation (16%) and Energy & Utilities (9%). Top-10 clients accounted for 20.9% of IT Services revenue, up from 20.8% in the March quarter. Wipro has 14 clients (vs. 11 in March) with an annual revenue run-rate of $50+ million, 33 (vs. 33) with $20-50 million and 33 (vs. 36) with $10-20 million. Wipro added 31 new IT Services clients – including four from the Fortune-1000 – compared with 48 in the immediately prior period. It exited the quarter with an active roster of 928, up from 927 in March.Wipro generated CFFO of $231.5 million (or $0.16 per ADS) in the quarter. Major outflows comprised capital expenditures ($98.8 million). Wipro exited the quarter with net cash of $158.9 million, down from $187.5 million on March 31. Accounts and unbilled receivables slipped to 80 DSOs from 76 in March.Highlights from Analyst Day Presentation in New York Indian IT+BPO exports ($40 billion) represent only 2.3% of global technology spending ($1.8 trillion).Wipro Differentiators:Wipro Priorities:WIT shares are suitable for aggressive investors. In our opinion, principal risks include the following: U.S. slowdown; rising offshore salaries; appreciation of the Indian currency, which would translate into higher expenses incurred in rupees; correction in the Bombay Stock Exchange and/or U.S. markets; political opposition in the U.S.; and geopolitical uncertainty in the Indian subcontinent.ANALYST CERTIFICATIONI, Ashish Thadhani, certify that all the views expressed in this research report accurately reflect my personal views of the subject companies.

• • •

Investment Conclusion. Based on a short-term revenue slowdown
and lower underlying profitability, we are reducing our estimates: fiscal
2009 EPADS to $0.60 on revenue of $6.177 billion (25% YoY growth)
from $0.63 on revenue of $6.524 billion; and fiscal 2010 EPADS to
$0.70 on revenue of $7.686 billion (24% YoY growth) from $0.77 on
revenue of $8.409 billion. Our estimates imply 26%/11% compound
revenue/EPADS growth in calendar 2007-09 – after factoring a one-
time jump in the tax-rate due to expiration of prior tax benefits.
Given continued investor concern over the U.S. IT spending
environment (61.4% of revenue), we are resetting our target price from
$16.50 to $14. In 12-months, this would correspond to 20x forward
EPS of $0.70 – in line with the current valuation (21x). While recent
deterioration in the macro environment poses short-term challenges,
this scenario could serve to accelerate longer-term offshoring adoption.
Wipro remains differentiated by its leading presence across fast growing
practices such as Infrastructure Management and BPO; penetration of
the Technology vertical; significant margin levers; an acquisition
program emphasizing domain/geographic expansion; focus on process
excellence; and exposure to Indian consumer/infrastructure spending.
4Q08 Results. EPADS of $0.15 vs. $0.14 a year ago on revenue of
$1.399 billion (39% YoY growth) beat our $0.14 estimate on revenue of
$1.411 billion. Results benefited from a $19 million forex gain (+1.2
cent EPS impact) and $6 million R&D credit (+0.4 cent). Accordingly,
operating income rose 29% YoY and exceeded our estimate. Highlights
included 5.5% QoQ organic revenue growth in the Global IT Services
segment (based on realized and not quarter-end exchange rates);
improved operating margin at the recently acquired Infocrossing unit;
and three $50+ million wins, including a U.S. consumer electronics
company and Etihad Atheeb Telecom in Saudi Arabia.

102061,20480,2008-10-27T08:31:44-04:00,,"Excerpts from Gilford Securities analyst Ashish R. Thadhani's recent note to clients on Wipro (NYSE:WIT):• • •Investment Conclusion. Based on delays in IT spending decisions amidst the ongoing global financial crisis – and material hedging exposure arising from recent rupee depreciation – we are reducing our estimates as follows: fiscal 2009 EPADS to $0.50 on revenue of $5.628 billion (14% YoY growth) from $0.59 on revenue of $6.056 billion; and fiscal 2010 EPADS to $0.55 on revenue of $6.195 billion (10% YoY growth) from $0.70 on revenue of $7.418 billion. Our model conservatively assumes no QoQ Services revenue growth in the next three quarters. Longer term, we believe that Wipro should deliver ~20% YoY Services revenue growth in fiscal 2011 and beyond. To reflect prevailing sentiment, we are also resetting our target price from $14.50 to $9. In 12-months, this would correspond to 15x forward EPS – a modest premium to the current valuation. These aggressive cuts enable us to accentuate 1) an upward bias to our estimates; and 2) inexpensive valuation of 14x forward EPS. While recent deterioration in the macro environment clearly poses short-term challenges, we believe that rising cost pressures could ultimately serve to accelerate offshoring initiatives.2Q09 Results. EPADS of $0.12 vs. $0.14 a year ago on revenue of $1.380 billion (16% YoY growth) missed our $0.14 estimate on revenue of $1.463 billion. Revenue was held back by unfavorable currency swings (-$74 million impact). Results also included a sizable $25 million net currency translation/hedging loss (-1.5 cent EPS impact). Operating income rose 7% YoY. Highlights included 4.0% QoQ and 29% YoY revenue growth in the IT Services segment (based on realized and not quarter-end exchange rates); resilient growth in the U.S. region (+3.3% QoQ and +32% YoY) and Financial Services segment (+7.8% QoQ and +41% YoY); improved price realizations (+5% YoY); and six wins in the $30-100 million TCV category.• Takeaways. Wipro recorded encouraging QoQ movement in price realizations (+1.8%), utilization (+1.0%) and wage inflation (low-end of prior range). However, it posted uninspiring trends in volume growth (+1.2%), operating margin (-50 bps), headcount expansion (+2.0%), employee attrition (+4.4%) and DSOs (+5) – and also suspended the interim dividend (INR 2 per ADS).Management noted: rapid deterioration in the global economic landscape since September – combined with a currency headwind and fewer working days – to explain cautious 3Q09 IT Services revenue guidance of 1.0% QoQ and 14-15% YoY growth; although less than 2% of revenue is directly exposed to impacted organizations – given the uncertain environment – other clients are deferring decisions or placing discretionary projects on hold; surprising strength in the U.S. and Financial Services segments can be attributed to critical/continuity projects and ramp-up of a large client; and annual offshore salary increases (effective August 1) moderated to 7-8% vs. 12-13% in prior years. To counter a slowing economy, Wipro will focus on scalable transformational opportunities, particularly with existing clients; leverage its consulting and domain capabilities; and move steadily toward a more non-linear model, i.e., through IP creation and sharing in productivity gains.• Revenue at the core Services segment advanced 15% YoY to $1.023 billion but fell short of our $1.086 billion estimate due to a currency distortion. Growth was driven by the Infrastructure Management practice (65% YoY), Manufacturing & Healthcare vertical (42%) and India & Middle East region (48%). Operating income of $220.0 million (15.9% margin) fell short of our $241.7 million estimate (16.5% margin) due to lower profitability in the Products segment, higher amortization expense and forex losses. Profitability on a QoQ basis was hurt by a scheduled salary increase for offshore employees (140 bps impact) – mitigated by improved price realizations and utilization. In the reclassified IT Services segment, operating margin dropped to 20.3% from 21.8% a year ago, primarily on account of the Infocrossing acquisition. Near-term, Wipro expects a stable operating margin in spite of an annual salary increase for BPO employees in 3Q09. Available levers for offsetting annual wage pressure comprise pricing (driven by performance on fixed-price projects and non-linear initiatives), employee/offshore-mix, utilization and acquisition performance.• Hourly price realizations averaged $71.42 for onsite work (up 1.9% QoQ and 5.0% YoY) and $24.23 for offshore (up 1.8% QoQ and 4.6% YoY). Billed volume rose just 1.2% QoQ and 16% YoY. Utilization (excluding trainees) stood at 79.3% vs. 79.0% a year ago. Higher-margin offshore work contributed 45.9% of service revenue vs. 46.1% in the June quarter. Global headcount rose 2.0% QoQ and 10% YoY to 97,552 in September. Attrition deteriorated to 21.0% from 17.9% a year ago due to a spike in the involuntary component.• By vertical, Technology, Media & Telecom ranked largest (30% of IT Services revenue), followed by Financial Services (26%), Manufacturing & Healthcare (19%), Retail & Transportation (17%) and Energy & Utilities (8%). Top-10 clients accounted for 20.4% of IT Services revenue, down from 20.9% in the June quarter. Wipro has 16 clients (vs. 14 in June) with an annual revenue run-rate of $50+ million, 34 (vs. 33) with $20-50 million and 35 (vs. 33) with $10-20 million. Wipro added 28 new IT Services clients compared with 31 in the immediately prior period. It exited the quarter with an active roster of 906, down from 928 in June but masking a shift toward larger names.• Wipro generated CFFO of $159.7 million (or $0.11 per ADS) in the quarter. Major outflows comprised a dividend distribution ($147.0 million), capital expenditures ($93.9 million) and acquisition payment ($23.9 million). Wipro exited the quarter with net cash of –$1.4 million, down from +$158.9 million on June 30. Accounts and unbilled receivables slipped to 85 DSOs from 80 in June.

43849,20861,2007-08-08T05:44:14-04:00,,"With the announcement of Infocrossing's acquisition for around $410mn ($18.70/share for 22.10 mn shares outstanding), Wipro (NYSE : WIT) has heralded a new era of big acquisitions. 
Investors will be eager to see how this acquisition helps the bottom line of the company. Infocrossing's net worth as of Mar-31/2007 was $127 mn (with $157mn in goodwill) and its market cap as of Aug 7 was $400mn.
Revenues for 2006,2005 and 2004 were $229mn, $148mn, $104mn. Operating income during this period was $25mn, $10mn and $12mn, and net income was $8mn,$2.5mn and $19mn.  Interest expense for Infocrossing was $25mn for 2006 and Income tax expense of $6.8mn(35% tax rate).
With the assumption of 20% return on investment , over four years Wipro should generate $400mn of cash from this new company, recouping the investment."
114414,22196,2009-01-12T16:02:36-05:00,,"Shares of Wipro (NYSE:WIT) are off nearly 8 percent today after the company disclosed that in 2007 the World Bank banned it from contract bids from 2007-2011 and included it on a list of firms ""providing improper benefits to bank staff.""Wipro said in 2000 it allowed employees and clients to buy shares at its IPO price and allowed the World Bank to participate in the plan, where staff and their families ultimately bought 1,750 shares for $72,000. Wipro said all participants signed a conflict of interest statement saying the share purchase ""did not violate any ethics or conflict of interest policies of their company.""Wipro downplayed the World Bank's contribution to its business, but any hint of further impropriety in the Indian outsourcing sector is unwelcome. Investors are still nervous after the Satyam Computer Services scandal, a massive $1billion dollar financial fraud known as ""India's Enron"" that has led to the arrest of Satyam's former Chairman Ramalinga Raju and his brother and Satyam cofounder B. Rama Raju.The sector, already beset by a slowing economy, is likely to remain under pressure as its key customers including American financial firms face slower growth and tightened budgets. The Wipro news dragged the Sensex, which tracks the Bombay Stock Exchange, down nearly 300 points as record selling continues, though Satyam (SAY) shares were up today after the company appointed a new board. Last week Citigroup noted the disruption in the Indian IT services market would help larger players, but picked industry leader Infosys (NYSE:INFY) as its favorite, saying Wipro ""will continue to trade at a discount to Infosys given expected sub-par growth in the coming years."" With faith in Wipro badly shaken, there is little reason to expect that to change now."
116650,20480,2009-01-27T04:11:11-05:00,,"Excerpted from Gilford Securities analyst Ashish R. Thadhani's recent report to clients on Wipro (NYSE:WIT):• • •Based on slow IT spending in a deepening global economic downturn – with significant exposure to the Financial Services and Technology verticals – we are adjusting our estimates as follows: fiscal 2009 EPADS to $0.51 on revenue of $5.548 billion (12% YoY growth) from $0.50 on $5.628 billion; and fiscal 2010 EPADS to $0.50 on revenue of $5.581 billion (1% YoY growth) from $0.55 on $6.195 billion. At this time, we are introducing a fiscal 2011 EPADS estimate of $0.50 – including a one-time jump in the tax-rate – on revenue of $6.123 billion (10% YoY growth). Our current model anticipates no sustained upturn in IT Services revenue until the March 2010 quarter. In this environment, even flat revenue and EPS in calendar 2009E should attest to the durability of a business model. We are lowering our target price from $9 to $7.50. In 12-months, this would correspond to 15x forward EPS – a modest premium to the current valuation (13x).3Q09 EPADS of $0.13 on revenue of $1.346 billion beat our $0.12 estimate on revenue of $1.411 billion. Revenue was held back by currency volatility (-$49 million impact) – primarily steep rupee depreciation of 4.6% QoQ and 23.3% YoY – and a worldwide cyclical downturn in the infrastructure/engineering business (4% of revenue). On a constant currency basis, IT services revenue rose 19.2% YoY and 3.5% QoQ compared with less flattering realized figures of +12.4% YoY and -0.9% QoQ. Wipro recorded acceptable QoQ progress across key operating metrics (page 5): volume (+2.2%), blended revenue productivity (+1.2% on a constant currency basis), offshore revenuemix (+0.9%) and operating margin (+30 bps excluding a write-down necessitated by the Nortel bankruptcy). However, it also posted lower headcount (-0.6% attributed to a preference for need-based hiring vs. maintaining a large bench plus non-linear initiatives) and client-count (-2.6% due to completion of projects for smaller clients), along with stubborn attrition (involuntary exit of underperforming employees).On a constant currency basis, core IT Services revenue exceeded guidance by 0.4%. Areas of relative strength included the Retail & Transportation vertical (+11.4% QoQ); Europe (+7.5%) and the India & Middle East region (+5.5%); and the Package Implementation practice (+3.7%). Weakness was noticeable across the Technology segment (-3.8%) while Financial Services stood firm (+2.1%). Operating income of $218.0 million (16.2% margin) fell short of our $230.6 million estimate (16.3% margin) due to a deficit in the infrastructure business and a non-recurring provision for one-half of Nortel receivables ($8 million). Profitability on a QoQ basis was aided by currency (30 bps), revenue productivity and offshore-mix – mitigated by the Nortel (NT) charge (60 bps) and recent offshore salary increases. We point out that Nortel contributes ~1.5% of revenue, the bulk of which is expected to hold steady in coming periods. In the IT Services segment, operating margin slipped to 20.0% from 20.3% in the immediately prior quarter. Wipro is confident of sustaining the operating margin within a narrow range in spite of clients pushing for price reductions. We note that Wipro did not implement its January onsite wage hike this year.During the quarter, Wipro recorded four transformational wins – most coming against strong global players and validating its acquisition rationale. These included Origin Energy (SAP implementation), a U.S. data processing company ($100+ million managed services contract across Infocrossing data centers) and a U.K. food retailer (large-scale process change on the Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) ERP platform). To enhance its relevance in the current environment, Wipro has introduced a new suite of offerings, e.g., an Application Rationalization service will enable clients to reduce cost by 15-20% while improving operational efficiency. Additionally, it is responding to client needs through innovative delivery models (SaaS and outcome-based pricing) and proprietary industry-specific solutions.Management cited the Financial Services and Technology sectors – and likely delays during reassessment of annual spending priorities – to explain surprisingly soft 4Q09 IT Services revenue guidance, i.e., 6.8% QoQ contraction on an organic, constant currency basis. Chairman Premji offered a sober outlook for 2009 and acknowledged that the fragile global economy is impacting business across segments. Still, Wipro is strongly positioned to meet client requirements, i.e., with integrated offerings that reduce overhead associated with managing multiple relationships, steadfast loyalty during a difficult period, ability to lower operating expenses and conserve capital (see process optimization services above), and undisputed financial strength and integrity.Wipro has not felt any adverse fallout from the Satyam (SAY) scandal. It is not soliciting Satyam clients – but being duly responsive when approached for business continuity planning. Like Infosys (NYSE:INFY), we commend Wipro for its voluntary disclosure of cash balances held at all financial institutions. However, any move to discontinue (already limited) guidance – even if this is rendered less meaningful due to currency distortions – would represent a step backward.In January, Wipro acquired from Citigroup (NYSE:C) its India-based captive IT unit. Excluding cash, the $101 million purchase price translates into a reasonable 1.3x LTM revenue, 3.3x EBITDA and 3.8x net income. Terms include a $500 million revenue commitment over six years and preferred vendor status. Citi Technology Services (CTS) with its 1,650 employees will strengthen ADM and infrastructure management competencies for cards, capital markets and corporate banking. The all cash acquisition should be nominally accretive to EPS and allow Wipro to address complex banking engagements worldwide. Exposure to Citi Holdings (bad bank) is limited to ~10% of CTS revenue.The underlying philosophy of Wipro’s hedging program calls for upfront protection against future rupee volatility – covering 20% of net inflows from long term contracts. At present, potential loss of revenue and EPS upside on outstanding hedges (caused by steep rupee depreciation) stands at $324 million over 3-4 years, or ~$25 million per quarter (EPADS impact = 1.5 cents). This figure is marked to quarterly USD/INR movements. Additionally, to shield USD investments ($600 million Infocrossing acquisition) from currency risk, Wipro has established a $350 million yen-based loan swapped into USD. Accordingly, the Indian GAAP balance sheet it is protected to this extent against USD/INR movements. However, this natural hedge does not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP, which remains exposed to quarterly USD/INR cross-currency translation losses (-$14 million in 3Q09 recorded in interest/other income). Finally, balance sheet translation on all outstanding hedges is reconciled at quarter-end under forex gains/losses (+$3 million in 3Q09).WIT shares are suitable for aggressive investors. In our opinion, principal risks include the following: U.S. slowdown; rising offshore salaries; appreciation of the Indian currency, which would translate into higher expenses incurred in rupees; correction in the Bombay Stock Exchange and/or markets; political opposition in the U.S.; and geopolitical uncertainty in the Indian subcontinent.Disclosure: I, Ashish Thadhani, certify that all the views expressed in this research report accurately reflect my personal views of the subject companies.

46623,20861,2007-09-07T03:49:00-04:00,,"Since Wipro (NYSE:WIT) announced its acquisition of Infocrossing, analyzing Infocrossing's 10-k report was one the items in my to-do list. The following are some important points I found out about this infrastructure-cum-health care BPO company. 
Infocrossing's (IFOX) biggest asset is its data centers that it uses to manage its customers IT infrastructure, which mostly consists of mainframes, Unix and linux servers. The company has grown organically as well as through acquisitions. 

Infocrossing’s Health Care Services
 On October 1, 2004, the company acquired the common stock of the Medicaid, Medicare and Managed Care claims processing business (the ""Claims Processing Business"") of Verizon Information Technologies Inc. (""VITI"") from VerizonCommunications Inc. for $43,500,000 in cash and approximately $1,886,000 in related acquisition costs (the ""IHS Acquisition"").
Infocrossing West Inc.
On April 2, 2004, the company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of ITO Acquisition Corporation, a California corporation doing business as Systems Management Specialists [SMS] from ITO Holdings, LLC (""Holdings"") for$34,909,000 in cash, $1,224,000 in related acquisition costs and 135,892 shares of common stock of the company valued at approximately $1,439,000 (the SMS Acquisition). Prior to the acquisition, SMS changed its name to Infocrossing West, Inc. (IFOX West).
Infocrossing's products and services are mainly classified into:
 Business with State of Missouri 
 For the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Missouri Department of Social Services, accounted for in excess of 10% of Infocrossing’s consolidated revenue.
Targeting mid size businesses by leveraging selective outsourcing
 Infocrossing's services are particularly attractive to mid-tier companies that need substantial infrastructure to support their business environment, but are considered ""small"" compared to the multi-billion dollar engagements executed by companies like IBM or EDS. Many mid-market companies perceive large companies like IBM and EDS as ""inflexible"" and ""unresponsive"" to their smaller-scale requirements.
Five data centers: Following are the five data centers of infocrossing.
 The equipment in the data centers are usually leased and are structured as capital leases and contain bargain purchase options.
Income Tax Scenario 
For 2006, they recorded tax expense of $6.81million compared with tax expense of $2.15millionn for 2005. The effective tax rate in 2006 was 45%, compared with an effective tax rate of 46% in 2005. Although income taxes accrued at a rate of 45% in the current period, they are payable at the rate of 10% after the application of net operating loss carry-forwards. They had a deferred tax valuation allowance of $2.46mn in December 31, 2006 and 2005. Their net operating loss carry-forwards of approximately $34mn for Federal income tax purposes begins to expire in 2019. The use of these net operating loss carry-forwards is limited in future years according to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.
Depreciation and Amortization 
Depreciation and amortization of fixed assets and other intangible assets increased $5.79mn (52%) to $16.94mn for 2006 from $11.14mn for 2005. This increase was related to increases in assets from the Structure acquisition, including $1.87million in amortization of client contracts.
In 2005, depreciation and amortization increased $2.46mn (28.4%) to $11.14mn from $8.67mn for 2004. Of this increase, $387,000 or 15.7% of the increase related to the acquisition of IST. Approximately $1.39mn or 56.3% of the increase related to depreciation and amortization related to entities acquired in 2004. The remainder of the increase of $690,000, or 28.0% of the increase, resulted from new fixed asset additions during 2005 and 2004. Depreciation and amortization decreased as a percentage of revenues to 7.5% in 2005 compared with 8.3% in 2004.
EBITDA 
For 2006, EBITDA was $41.99mn compared with $22.08mn for 2005, 18% and15% as a percentage of revenue, respectively. It should be kept in mind that EBITDA does not take into account the following:
(a) changes in, or cash requirements for working capital needs.
(b) significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debts.
(c) cash requirements for capital expenditures.
The Credit Agreements
 On November 30, 2005 Infocrossing entered into a $70mn senior secured credit facility. The Credit Agreement provides for a $55 million term loan, subject to combination of scheduled quarterly repayment amounts which began September 30, 2006. Annual payments are due no more than 95 days after each year-end of 50% of their Excess Cash Flow, as that term is defined in the Credit Agreement. The first of such payments is due no later than April 3, 2007, and is estimated to be $177,000, and there will be other payments as described below. 
The Credit Agreement also provides for a $15 million revolving credit facility (including letter of credit subfacilities). During 2006, they repaid $5mn on the revolving credi tfacility and currently have no balance due. The maturity date for both the term loan and the revolving credit facility is April 14, 2009. On December 31, 2006, the interest rate on the term loan was 8.5%.
Scheduled quarterly amortization payment made in 2006 totaled $4,779,000. The current scheduled quarterly amounts due on the term loan are: $11.89mn for 2007 and $16.65 million for 2008. The balance of the term loan and any amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due April 14, 2009. They have $72mn of outstanding 4.0% Convertible Senior Notes due July 15, 2024.
The Notes are convertible, subject to certain conditions, at the option of the holder prior to maturity, into shares of  common stock at a specified conversion price, subject to certain adjustments. The conversion price must be adjusted to reflect stock dividends, stock splits, issuances of rights to purchase shares of common stock, and other events. Upon conversion, the company will have the right to deliver to the holders, at company's option, cash, shares of common stock, or a combination.. At the initial conversion price of $15.36, the Notes were convertible into 4,687,500 common shares. The Notes and the shares of common stock into which they may be converted may be resold pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 that became effective in August 2004.
Number of Shares offered for Conversion is Affected by the Stock Price of the Company 
On August 5, 2005, because the market price of Infocrossing's stock was less than $10.48 (68.23% of the initial conversion price) for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on August 5, 2005, a reset adjustment was triggered, whereby the conversion price was immediately reduced by 17.38% to $12.69.
 As a result of the reset adjustment, the number of common shares into which the Notes are convertible is 5,673,759, an increase of 986,259 shares. No further reset adjustments will be made, but the adjusted conversion price of $12.69 remains subject to adjustment as noted above for stock dividends, splits, issuances of rights to purchase shares of common stock, and other events .
The reset adjustment was valued in accordance with EITF 00-27; ""Application of Issue No. 98-5 - Certain Convertible Instruments"" at $4.59million, and this amount was recorded as an increase in Additional Paid in Capital and as a discount tithe carrying value of the Notes. This additional discount is being accredited to the carrying value of the Notes through an interest charge for the life of the Notes.
My Next Task
 It will be interesting to see Wipro's strategy in handling the credit arrangements of Infocrossing. I will try to contact Mr. Suresh Senapathy (CFO of Wipro) and see if I can give you all some more information. Please stay tuned for more on this topic."
61104,20480,2008-01-22T18:56:46-05:00,,Excerpts from Gilford Securities analyst Ashish R. Thadhani's recent note to clients on Wipro (NYSE:WIT):
41577,20922,2007-07-19T05:18:43-04:00,,"India's third biggest software company, Wipro Ltd (NYSE:WIT), is expected to follow the current weakness in the IT sector and post lower first-quarter profits than the preceding period due to declining revenues and margins and the strength of the rupee.  The NYSE-listed company's first-quarter profits could fall 9-13 percent against the fourth quarter, though earnings could rise 20-25 percent from the year-ago period, analysts said. They added that Wipros revenues will be adversely affected by a poor quarter in its infotech division as products were not delivered in the period, and that its margins will be hit by a strengthening Indian rupee. A seasonally weak first quarter for Wipro Infotech could affect the consolidated results, ABN-AMRO said in its brokerage note. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial expect Wipro to report a first-quarter net profit of 7.79 billion rupees on revenue of 42.62 billion. In the same period last year, the company had a net profit of 6.2 billion rupees on revenue of 31.42 billion. For the fourth quarter, Wipros net profit was 8.56 billion rupees on revenue of 43.33 billion. Analysts also said revenues from the company's Global IT Services, which account for most of Wipro's total business, might slip by 2-3 percent in rupee terms. CLSA expects Wipro to post Global IT sales of 722 million USD. The company had forecast Global IT revenue of 711 million USD for the first quarter, which is down 1.9 percent from the fourth quarter but up 22 percent year-on-year. Head of research at IL & FS Investmart, R Sreesankar said: Although Wipro is not making its annual salary hikes in the first quarter, the company's operating margins are expected to fall. An analyst at Edelweiss Securities, however, said no additional pressure is seen on the margins as there is no wage inflation in the quarter, but added that pressure will be on EBITDA due to forex issues. The Indian rupee has appreciated 8.76 pct since the beginning of the year to 40.41 rupees against the US dollar, causing concern in the Indian IT industry as most software exporters derive more than 60 pct of their revenues from the US.  Over the past week, the company's competitor and IT bellwether Infosys Technologies Ltd (NYSE:INFY) reported a first-quarter net profit of 10.79 billion rupees on revenues of 37.73 billion rupees, down 8.5 percent from the preceding quarter. Tata Consultancy Services Ltd's first-quarter consolidated net profit rose to 12.03 billion rupees from 11.95 billion rupees in the fourth quarter and sales grew to 53.64 billion rupees from 52.66 billion rupees.

Compared to the previous two quarters ($100 million profits on $378 million revenue for Mar-2005 quarter, and $98.7 million profits on $483 million revenue for Dec-2004 quarter) profits were down by more than 20 percent. This decrease was primarily due to appreciation of the Indian currency, and increased invesment in sales and restructuring of their Business Processing Operations (NYSE:BPO) unit.
Wipro hired 2,097 software professionals during the latest quarter, for a total staff of 41,911. It also received 29 new clients. Wipro's profit margin will come under further pressure in the next few months, with increasing pricing pressure  and company’s announced salary increases in October. Recently, Indian companies such as Satyam, Wipro, Cognizant have been under increased pressure to hike employee compensation to compete with their foreign rivals such as EDS, Accenture, and KPMG, who have been outsourcing their US and UK projects to their Indian divisions.

Indian IT giant Wipro (NYSE:WIT) is looking at Vietnam as a possible offshore destination. Wipro is currently investing in a center in Romania and is looking at other Asian destinations.  The Romanian centre is the first offshore destination center opened by Wipro outside India. This center is aimed at serving as a near-shore destination for the company’s customers in Europe. Around $250 million was invested into setting up the facility. Wipro actually wants to set up strategic offshore centers to capture the markets around these centers; they are also being opened so as to minimize the risk of operating from a single location. Clients are also concerned about the processing of their data from so far away. Wipro wants to minimize this risk, by operating from a center much closer to a client's location. For this, the company is currently studying the potential of having operations in Vietnam and other regions in Asia. Wipro is also planning to ramp up investments in Australia in the next two years including the establishment of a near-shore center there. (source: CIOL). WIT 1-yr chart:"

The most unique aspect of Wipro's business is that its IT services are just 75% of its revenues. The remaining 25% is composed of services and products targeted at

Indian and Asian Pacific markets. 
Its 2007 revenue breakup was as follows:
Global IT services $2,355 million

BPO services $219 million
India and Asia Pacific:
Services: $194 million

Products: $360 million

Consumer Care: $175 million

Others: $164 million
TOTAL $3,467 million (IT services $2,574 million, other businesses $893 million).
Since IT services have a greater profit margin, the following is breakup of its operating income for fiscal 2007:
IT services - 82%

BPO - 7%

India and AsiaPac IT services and products - 7%

Consumer care and lighting - 4%
Its Indian IT products and services have nothing to do with its IT exports to USA, so it is critical to analyze them and figure out the growth of this segment in Wipro's total revenues.
Indian Domestic IT Market
According to IDC, the domestic IT market in India grew by 22.4% in 2006. The estimated year-on-year growth in 2007 is estimated to be 21.5% in 2007, making it the fastest growing market in the Asia-Pacific region. The domestic Indian IT industry is primarily composed of hardware, packaged software and IT services.
The domestic IT packaged software market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 20.9% during the period of 2006-2010. Application software will continue to account for the largest portion of the packaged software market.
The hardware market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.5% during the same period. Within the hardware market, the PC market has grown to 5.5 million units in 2006. Desktops constitute the largest component of the market, followed by laptops and servers, in unit and value terms.
In unit terms, the PC market in India is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 19.9% over the next 5 years. The domestic IT services market in India has witnessed good growth in the last one year. According to IDC estimates, the domestic IT services market for the year 2006 is estimated at US$ 3.5 Billion. The market is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 16.6% over the next 5 years.

2007.............. $554 million

2006.............. $370 million

2005.............. $307 million

2004.............. $217 million
It can be seen that the revenues from IT services and products from India have more than doubled since fiscal 2004 a growth of 27% CAGR. This growth is completely shielded from any change in dollar to rupee rate."

Wipro has made six acquisitions since December 2005, which are estimated to add $17 million to company revenues in F1Q07, according to Keane.

1666,20062,2005-09-02T01:46:23-04:00,,"India’s richest man, Aziz Premji, Chairman and CEO of Wipro, said today that he will lower his 82 percent stake in Wipro Ltd., the country’s third largest software exporter after TCS and Infosys. Markets welcomed his announcement and took the stock price up 3.4%, to touch the 52 Week high.  Counterintuitive?



By Radha Kota.
Premji, 59, is ranked 38 in the Forbes list of billionaires with personal wealth valued at US$9.3 billion. In a press release Premji stated that he is going to cut his stake due to his philanthropic commitments. 
I believe there are reasons other than this philanthropic commitment behind the move. For starters, there are the India’s Securities Board's (SEBI's) recent regulations requiring that at least 25% of any publicly traded company’s stock should be in the float. Another likely reason is pressure from insiders to release some of his control over the company.  It has been speculated for a long time that Wipro’s previous vice-chairman and chief of Wipro America, Vivek Paul, who helped build the Indian company from a $150 million software-services provider into a $1.4 billion powerhouse, left Wipro mainly due to Premji’s dominance. 
I don’t know any one in the U.S. that owns 82 percent of a major publicly traded company.  Please reply to this post if you do.
Whatever the reason may be, markets like liquidity and thus generally like a larger float. As the total number of shares will not increase, the P/E is not affected. In summary, this is a short term positive and a long term non-event. 
Premji is a graduate in electrical engineering from Stanford University, is known to be a taskmaster who likes to keep his fingers on the pulse of the business. After his father passed away in 1966, Premji took on leadership of Wipro at the age of 21 and built the $1.5 million oil company into $1.4 billion IT Services and BPO company.

        However, with a forward P/E of over 500x, its stock is overvalued.
        We believe that Wix’s shares have an unattractive risk/reward ratio and it’s better to stay away from its stock despite its impressive performance in the last few months.","While Wix (WIX) will continue to aggressively expand and grow its top line in the next few months, we believe that purchasing its stock at the current price is a risky endeavor. With a market cap of over $16 billion, the company makes less than $1 billion in revenues in a year, while its stock trades at a forward P/E of over 500x, way above its peers. At the same time, Wix has never made an annual profit on a GAAP basis after becoming a public company and it spends the majority of its revenues on marketing expenses in order to sustain its current growth rate. For that reason, we believe that Wix’s shares have an unattractive risk/reward ratio and it’s better to stay away from its stock despite its impressive performance in the last few months.In the first half of the year, Wix greatly benefited from nationwide lockdowns around the globe, which forced more people to go online. As a provider of various web-based solutions for web developers and entrepreneurs, Wix has one of the most sophisticated ecosystems of products among its peers. The majority of the company’s clients are small businesses that want to expand their presence on the internet and use Wix as a one-stop-shop for their needs.Source: WixRecently, Wix had the strongest quarter in its history. From April to June, its revenues increased by 27% Y/Y to $236 million and the business was able to add 9.3 million additional users, which is an increase of 64% Y/Y and an increase of 4% Q/Q. During the period, the company also added new dropshipping tools, improved its order and fulfillment features, and improved its website editor. However, the company’s GAAP EPS in Q2 was -$1.06, below the street estimates by $0.56, while the advertising expenses increased by 90% Y/Y. Despite constantly increasing its top line, Wix’s net loss has been widening in the last few quarters and in Q2 it was -$57.74 million.The reality is that Wix doesn’t have a unique business model and it needs to rely solely on an aggressive marketing campaign to retain its growth levels and increase its customer base. As a provider of web-based solutions, Wix is competing with companies like Shopify (SHOP), Square (SQ), and Adobe (ADBE), all of which provide similar services to customers. In addition, with enough knowledge of web development, entrepreneurs have a choice to use open source engines like WordPress, BigCommerce, Magento, and others, which provide similar web-development solutions at a cheaper cost. By competing in such a competitive environment, Wix has no other option but to reinvest the bulk of its revenues on advertising in order to stay relevant.In the last decade, Wix has never made an annual profit on a GAAP basis and it’s unlikely that it’ll reach the breakeven point anytime soon, as the street expects its EPS for the year to be -$0.45. At the same time, the company will likely continue to raise more debt in the upcoming months in order to stay afloat and drive growth. In early August, Wix already raised $500 million by issuing convertible notes with a maturity date in 2025 and its debt load has been sequentially increasing in the last eight quarters.While aggressive advertising so far has been successful, there’s no guarantee that the company will be able to sustain the current growth rate in the long-term. Currently, small businesses are being affected the most by the pandemic, and thousands of enterprises already declared bankruptcy in the United States in the last few months. As we are in the midst of a recession, even more businesses will likely go under in the following months. For that reason, it’s hard to justify Wix’s market cap of over $16 billion, considering that the company makes less than $1 billion in revenues in a year.However, Wix is not the only company from the sector that trades at such irrational exuberance levels. Its major competitors also trade at premium valuations and some of them even have negative margins. But the problem with Wix is that the company’s forward P/E of over 500x is way above the industry’s average forward P/E ratio of 180x, while at the same time its business has the worst margins when compared to others. Considering this, it’s safe to say that Wix is overvalued at the current price.Source: Capital IQFor that reason, we believe that purchasing Wix’s shares at this stage is too risky, as there’s not going to be enough margin of safety at the current levels. What’s also interesting is that recently the company received approval to increase its buyback program from an initial $100 million to $300 million. Considering the company’s premium valuation at this moment, we believe that it’s not going to be beneficial for the shareholders if the company allocates the available capital for buybacks at the current levels. If another selloff starts in the next few months, then Wix will be hit the hardest, due to its high price and the capital that is about to be used on stock repurchases will quickly evaporate. With that in mind, we believe that it’s safer to look for other companies with a more attractive risk/reward ratio than investing in Wix at the current price.On September 11, Bears of Wall Street will launch a new Marketplace service: Best Short Ideas.The goal of the service is to provide you with actionable short ideas from which you can profit by betting against the companies that trade at irrational exuberance levels and have limited upside. While the Fed continues to pump the stock market, there is still an array of businesses that cannot justify their premium valuations and our goal is to find those businesses.

Earnings report is due out on May 18th. Fasten your seat belts.","We are experiencing a historic paradigm shift led by the technology sector, specifically with digital transformation companies. These companies enable higher efficiency through digital processes that are enhanced by cloud-centricity. The work-from-home mandate as a result of the pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation dramatically. Some people believe that the shift to the cloud is the fourth leg of the industrial revolution. We are experiencing a historic business transformation as meaningful to the 21st century as the assembly line was to the 20th century.One company at the heart of the revolution is Wix.com Ltd. (WIX), a company that allows individuals and small businesses to create their own professional websites and create online stores. This market niche is extremely competitive but Wix is holding its own, with strong revenue growth of 26% per annum and a strong free cash flow margin of 17%. The combination of revenue growth and free cash flow margin allows Wix to fulfill the Rule of 40, putting it in an exclusive club of companies that are able to achieve strong growth and profitability.This week has been an exciting time because several of the software stocks that I track are breaking out to all-time highs. These stocks include Atlassian (TEAM), Twilio Inc. (TWLO), and Okta, Inc. (OKTA), among others. Wix is among the group of breakouts. Unlike most of the other stocks ""crushing it"" that are already quite overvalued, Wix is, in my opinion, very undervalued on a relative basis, making it a gem of an investment.(Source: Yahoo Finance/MS Paint)In a letter to shareholders issued on April 13th, Wix expects Q1 results to meet prior guidance. While there has been some increase in customer churn, the company notes that:Certainly, it is impossible to predict how Wix will perform for the remainder of 2020, but the company has a strong balance sheet, good free cash flow, and is seeing growth in subscriptions in some market niches. Wix should be in good shape once the pandemic scare subsides and global growth restarts.One industry metric that is often used for software companies is the Rule of 40. The metric sidesteps the valuation dilemma for high-growth companies that generally don't show profits. The Rule of 40 allows for both revenue growth and profitability (expressed as a margin) in combination such that they must add up to at least 40%. Analysts use various figures for profitability. I use the free cash flow margin.The rationale for the Rule of 40 is as follows. If a company grows by more than 40% annually, then you can turn a blind eye to negative free cash flow to some extent. On the other hand, if a company grows by less than 40%, then it should have a positive free cash flow to make up for the less-than-ideal growth.This rule accommodates both young, high-growth companies as well as mature, moderate-growth companies. Young companies tend to have high revenue growth but are burning cash. Mature companies have lower revenue growth, but they make up in terms of free cash flow. The 40% threshold is somewhat arbitrary but typically divides the digital transformation stock universe in half, separating the best stocks from the so-so ones.For a further description of the rule and calculation, please refer to a previous article I have written.(Source: Portfolio123/MS Paint)In Wix's case:Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 26% + 17% = 43%Its score is higher than the necessary 40% needed to fulfill the rule of thumb, suggesting that this company has a healthy balance between growth and profitability.There are numerous techniques for valuing stocks. Some analysts use fundamental ratios such as P/E, P/S, EV/P, or EV/S. I believe that one should not employ a simple ratio, and the reason is simple. Higher-growth stocks are valued more than lower-growth stocks, and rightly so. Growth is a significant parameter in discounted cash flow valuation.Therefore, I employ a technique that uses a scatter plot to determine relative valuation for the stock of interest versus the remaining 152 stocks in my digital transformation stock universe. The Y-axis represents the enterprise value/forward sales, while the X-axis is the estimated forward Y-o-Y sales growth.The plot below illustrates how Wix stacks up against the other stocks on a relative basis based on forward sales multiple.(Source: Portfolio123/private software)A best-fit line is drawn in red and represents an average valuation based on next year's sales growth. The higher the anticipated revenue growth, the higher the valuation. In this instance, Wix is situated significantly below the best-fit line, suggesting that the company is extremely undervalued on a relative basis.There are several risks that investors should consider before investing in Wix. First of all, I view the current stock market action to be reminiscent to the Dot.com era, immediately prior to the crash starting in 2000. While Wix is not overvalued, the same cannot be said for many of its software peers. Work-from-home plays such as Zoom (ZM) and Shopify (SHOP) have exceptionally high valuations. If we see a market crash due to the extreme valuation of some software stocks, then Wix will likely get swept along with the crowd.Wix has some issues that investors should be aware of. First of all, its SG&A expense margin is quite high. The company is currently spending 84% of its revenue intake on SG&A plus R&D. (Note that SG&A expenses include non-cash stock-based compensation.)(Source: Portfolio123)While this high level of expense is manageable given the company's cash reserve and free cash flow, an extended recession could prove troublesome.(Source: Portfolio123)Perhaps the biggest risk to Wix's business is the fact that the company primarily targets individuals and small businesses, those that will be most affected by the pandemic and subsequent global recession.Wix has recently broken out to an all-time high. When a breakout occurs, it usually signifies more bullishness to come. Wix is a strong company with an annual revenue growth of 26% and a positive free cash flow margin of 17%, allowing it to fulfill the Rule of 40.The company indicated in a recent shareholder letter that it has experienced an increase in subscriber cancellations recently. But this should be expected given the current global economic conditions. The company also indicated that it is experiencing growth in new users and premium subscribers in some market sectors. This is a positive sign.The stock movement is strong, the company's fundamentals are strong, and, in my opinion, the stock price is extremely undervalued. I expect that Wix will benefit from the work-from-home mandate and come out of the current market conditions in a strong position to grow along with other digital transformation stocks.Note that the next earnings report is scheduled for May 14th."
4376895,102764,2020-09-29T16:43:18-04:00,"Wix delivered remarkably solid growth numbers last quarter.The company is aggressively investing in growth, and this is hurting operating profits.These investments are paying off, so management is doing the right thing by focusing on long-term growth as opposed to short-term profits.Considering the company's potential, the stock is reasonably valued at current prices.Wix is down by 20% from its highs of the year, and this could be creating a buying opportunity for long-term investors.","Wix (WIX) is in the right place at the right time. The company has a proven track record of execution, generating consistent performance over the long term. Demand is now accelerating due to the pandemic, and Wix is aggressively investing in marketing and advertising to consolidate its market position and to build the foundations for sustained growth in the future.These investments are taking a toll on accounting profits, but they are generating solid results and positioning the company for strong growth in the years ahead. The market seems to be skeptical, though, and Wix stock is down by nearly 20% from its highs of the year after the earnings report.Prioritizing future growth above short-term earnings is exactly what management needs to do at this stage, and the fact that the market is being fearful and short-sighted could be creating a buying opportunity for long-term investors in Wix stock.Having a strong online presence is crucially important for businesses of all sizes. This trend has been well in place for a long time, and it is now accelerating due to the pandemic.Wix offers a cloud-based set of solutions for companies to build their websites in a simple and cost-efficient way. The company has a freemium business model that drives monetization of user cohorts for many years after they are created. Acquiring large cohorts of users and monetizing them at higher levels with more and better products over the long term is a powerful growth strategy for Wix.Around websites, Wix is building new growth engines in areas such as CRM, marketing, and payments. In June of this year, the company launched its new e-commerce capabilities, increasing its presence in a huge market with massive long-term potential.Source: WixWell before the pandemic started, Wix was consistently growing at a strong rate. There was an acceleration in growth in the second quarter of 2020, but it is not like this is a transitory phenomenon due to the pandemic. Wix was already doing very well, and growth accelerated a few percentage points in the second quarter of 2020.Data by YChartsRevenue grew 27% during the second quarter. Creative Subscriptions revenue was $190.2 million in the period, an increase of 21%. Creative Subscriptions ARR was $790.9 million, an increase of 22%. Business Solutions revenue reached $45.9 million during the quarter, growing 62% year over year.Source: WixFree cash flow is evolving well, which is a major positive in terms of evaluating the company from a financial soundness perspective.Source: WixOn the other hand, sales and marketing investments grew by a staggering 67% year over year, reaching $119 million. Mostly because of this rapid increase in sales and marketing, the company reported an operating loss of $53.7 million during the quarter. Source: SEC filingsWall Street is generally too short-sighted, the market is typically expecting an expansion in profit margins for a company that is growing rapidly and has a structurally profitable business model based on subscriptions to a good degree. This disappointment can arguably explain why Wix stock is almost 20% down from its highs of the year. However, for long-term investors, this could be creating a buying opportunity.Management is seeing an increase in demand, and it is meeting this increase in demand with aggressive investing in marketing. In fact, marketing that is directly focused on the acquisition of users grew 90% year over year last quarter, reaching $75 million.This created the largest customer cohort in the company's history with over 9.3 million users, and management calculates that based on current cohort behavior this will generate approximately $570 million in future collections over the next eight years.Marketing efficiency is outstanding, management said during the conference call that 60% of marketing expenses that happened in Q2 have already been returned in cashback to Wix, so investments for growth are really paying off.Source: WixManagement also said that the newest user cohorts are monetizing at increasingly higher levels than past cohorts. A larger percentage of users are selecting higher-priced Business and eCommerce subscription packages, and the adoption of business solutions such as Ascend by Wix, Wix Payments, and paid third-party applications (TPAs) is also higher and continuing to increase. Users are also selecting longer-term packages, which reduces cancellations.Wix has significantly increased its marketing investments, but those investments are rapidly coming back to the company via increased revenue, and Wix is better positioned than ever to monetize those new users at higher levels in the future.The company also has over $1 billion in cash on its balance sheet and it has been generating positive free cash flows for a long time. Marketing investments are not only very profitable, but Wix can also afford these investments without jeopardizing the company's financial health.Source: WixWix stock reached new highs at almost $320 as the company was reporting earnings on August 6. Since then, the stock has pulled back by almost 20% from those levels, and now it seems to be finding support above $240.Source: TOSIn terms of valuation, Wix is very reasonably priced by industry standards. The chart below shows revenue estimates for Wix in the years ahead. Wall Street analysts are on average expecting the company to grow from $966 million in revenue this year to $5.2 billion in 2028.Source: Seeking AlphaLooking at revenue estimates for each specific year and the implied price to sales ratio, Wix is trading at 11.2 times revenue estimates for 2021. This is not excessive at all for a company that can sustain revenue growth rates in the neighborhood of 25% or more over the coming yearsSource: Seeking AlphaWix has a compelling business model that can produce attractive growth rates over time. The company is adding more new services to premium users and driving increased monetization, while also expanding into promising areas such as e-commerce and online education. International expansion is another key growth engine for the company, as the business model should scale efficiently on the international front.The industry is very competitive, and Wix needs to keep prices low in order to protect its market position and continue growing over time. But management has proven an ability to consistently execute, and there is no reason to expect the company to be derailed from its long-term growth trajectory as long as it keeps delivering solid products and investing as much as it needs to in sales and marketing.The stock market has focused too much on the short-term effect of increased marketing investments on margins, but the long-term increase in growth prospects due to these investments could be far more important. From current price levels, Wix is offering attractive upside potential for long-term investors."
4334142,105400,2020-03-25T12:20:15-04:00,"Wix has fallen roughly 37% since its 52-week high.The company has grown strongly with revenue growth rates above 30% in recent years.Moreover, Wix is undervalued by 25% based on my estimates.","Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) stock price has fallen roughly 37% from its 52-week high, mostly due to multiple adjustments from the recent market turmoil. Despite the big drop in share price, I believe that Wix has a strong track record with growing brand name and switching costs. At $97.22, it is undervalued by roughly 25% based on my base-case assumptions.(Source: Google)Wix has achieved revenue growth above 30% in recent years. Revenue has grown from $230M in 2015 to $761M in 2019, compounding at 30% year on year. Throughout the same period, gross margins have maintained above 70% at 74% in 2019.Looking from 2015, Wix had a history of continuous innovations that have expanded its suite of offerings. These innovations have dramatically increased Wix's total addressable market to the current $300B+.(Source: Investor Presentation)Wix has steadily grown both its registered users and premium subscriptions. Registered users grew from 54M in 2014 to 165M in 2019, while premium users grew from 1.1M to 4.5M in 2019. This highlights the strength of Wix's brand as users continue to find value in using the company's services.By providing a great service, Wix has also managed to extract a higher value from customers as seen from the growth in average revenue per subscription from $143 in Q2 2017 to $179 in Q4 2019.(Source: Investor Presentation)As users use more of Wix's services in creating an online website for their business, they become embedded onto Wix's platform. Wix then becomes a core aspect of the users' businesses. As Wix provides services for the businesses' various needs, it greatly increases the likelihood that they remain users. This can be seen below in how there is increasing monetization of users even from 2010.(Source: Investor Presentation)Wix's key markets include small-to-medium businesses. In an economic downturn, these businesses are more prone to business slowdown or failure, which could lead to stronger churn rates for Wix. Although Wix has been targeting agencies that create multiple websites for its clients, this only makes up a small percentage of its user base.Wix also faces intense competition in its space that may lead to slower customer adoption on its platform. Some of these competitors include Squarespace, Weebly, and WordPress. Wix has to ensure that its platform continues to delight customers to gain market share and keep them from switching over to competitors.1) Revenue growth at 20% for the next five years, then dropping to 2% in perpetuity starting from the year 2025. The high growth rates in the first five years reflect Wix's track record of high sales growth and its ability to expand its total addressable market. However, intense competition might put a lid on high sales growth in the future as Wix continues to expand its offering.2) Operating margin of 30% from 2027 onwards. Software players generally have high operating margins due to their high initial fixed costs and low incremental costs. Wix's gross margins have remained above 70% since 2015. Once Wix scales further and profitability becomes a priority, the company should experience a high level of operating margin expansion through operating leverage. However, if Wix has to incur higher customer acquisition costs due to strong competition, there could be some downward pressure on its margins in the near term.3) A sales-to-capital ratio of 2 is in line with its software peers. Developing software is not capital-intensive, so I estimate Wix will be able to generate $2 of sales with every $1 in incremental capital.4) Wix has an initial weighted cost of capital of 9%, which drops to 8% in the terminal year. The higher cost of capital reflects the higher risk of Wix having negative operating income and losing money. However, once the company achieves profitability and higher free cash flows, the risk should be reduced as reflected in the lower cost of capital. (Source: Author creation using Wix financials) (Figures are in $millions except per share data and percentages)The value I derived for Wix is roughly $6.1B for the entire company. This represents a 20% upside from its current price. As with all DCFs for high-growth companies, my point estimate valuation of $121 is likely to have a large spread of possible outcomes. To overcome this shortcoming, I compare its pricing multiples against other software companies.(Source: Author creation using data from Seeking Alpha)Compared to other high-growth peers, Wix looks fairly cheap in terms of price/sales and EV/sales ratios. Wix is priced cheaper than Appian which has roughly the lower growth profile and worse operating margins. Wix is also priced much cheaper than other SaaS companies like Okta.Potential investors have to decide if they believe Wix will be able to execute according to my base-case assumptions in the long run. If competition turns out to be stronger than expected and pushes down future sales growth, the recent pullback might not make Wix a screaming buy."
4356606,104952,2020-07-01T14:36:08-04:00,"As Wix looks to maintain the momentum in Q1, it has recently launched a competitive eCommerce offering at $17/month, ~40% lower than Shopify's entry-level plan of $29/month.Given the ongoing pandemic-related tailwind, we believe the launch of the offering is well-timed.Faster adoptions of the offering should continue lifting FCF margin higher than +18% in Q2. Wix already saw an accelerated 18% FCF margin in Q1.","Wix (WIX) is one of the companies that has been benefiting from the pandemic-related tailwind. As a company developing a website-building platform, it has seen a surge in demand for its offering as more businesses look to have more online presence. Traction has been remarkable as of Q1, with revenue growing at 24% YoY. It also saw newly registered users increased by 63% YoY to 3.2 million in April alone, representing the company’s monthly all-time high. Looking to build upon the momentum, Wix has recently launched a more advanced eCommerce solution, which we think was done at the right time. We initiate our coverage with an overweight rating.We believe that the recent extended eCommerce solution launch in late June was done at the right time, considering the strong tailwind at present. Furthermore, Wix should indeed anticipate more advanced eCommerce-related feature requests in the near term, having onboarded over 6.9 million new high-intent users in Q1. Based on the company’s recent findings, we think that two key motivations should accelerate adoptions for more advanced eCommerce solutions. First, the rising unemployment rates mean that more people will consider selling online as a new source of income. Second, many offline businesses will also increasingly look to shift online. (Source: Wix’s earnings call slide)Looking at the figures in Q1, it is also clear that these users came with a very high intention to utilize Wix’s platform not only to sell but also to build a business online, which requires more comprehensive features. In April, Wix Stores subscriptions grew by a staggering 580%, with its SMB CRM tool Ascend growing by 136%. Therefore, the launch of the offering demonstrates a commitment to maintaining the momentum. Furthermore, as competitors like Shopify (SHOP) and Squarespace should also benefit from the tailwind, it is a good time for Wix to dig deeper into eCommerce, in our view, to maintain its competitiveness.(Source: Company’s earnings call slide)We view the ongoing mix shift to the B&E (Business & eCommerce) plan and the faster adoption of the platform as likely catalysts for revenue and FCF growth acceleration and margin expansions longer term. The faster adoption as a result of the strong tailwind should continue maintaining the uptrend in ROI, which eventually drives FCF generation by quicker and higher cash collections. As seen above, the strong cash collections in Q1 resulted in a 0.5x per quarter ROI for Q1 2020 cohort, which was impressive, since it was already much higher than the historical average of ~0.28x.(Source: wix.com)With that in mind, we are optimistic that the 0.5x ROI can be the new normal for the Q2 2020 cohort and beyond, as the ongoing mix shift to the B&E plan will eventually raise overall ARPS (Average Revenue Per Subscribers) given the higher pricing. B&E pricing ranges from $17-$35 per month, higher than Wix’s Website regular pricing plan of $4-$24 per month. However, the pricing for B&E is also already competitive enough compared to a comparable Shopify plan, which starts at $29 per month. Consequently, we are confident that FCF growth may reach 37%-38% in Q2, which is the higher end of the 33%-40% range in the Q2 guidance. We also feel that the FCF margin can accelerate to +20% longer term, which is only 200 bps higher than the high end of the Q2 guidance range, once Wix is no longer investing in new initiatives heavily as it does at present.While we believe that Wix has done relatively well in taking advantage of the overall tailwind, the next potential big issue that it likely needs to address will revolve around retention. Just like Dropbox (DBX), Wix is one of few SaaS companies that does not openly publish its retention metrics, though based on its latest 20-F, there were 16% of its premium subscription users that signed up on a monthly, instead of an annual basis. At this point, it is not clear how the proportion has changed, especially as Wix continues to see high growth in new sign-ups.(Source: stockrow)The tailwind has driven up Wix’s valuation. From March onwards, Wix’s P/S has jumped to ~16x, outside of the historical range of 7x-11x over the last three years. Nonetheless, it is still a better alternative to Shopify, which currently trades at +60x P/S. Wix is also currently trading at an all-time-high of ~$256 per share, and the strong early adoption of the B&E plan in Q2 can potentially drive the price higher, since it will provide a validation of its competitive positioning in the eCommerce space, in addition to accelerating growth and FCF margin.With the expected ~18% FCF margin and +26% revenue growth, Wix’s rule-of-40 score is 44, which means that it has a relatively healthy growth despite the ongoing investments. As such, while ~16x P/S seems a bit high, Wix can always drive revenue higher and make the stock look cheap from a forward-looking perspective, though it will likely be at the expense of cash flow profitability. Given the score of 44, we think that Wix has a good enough balance between profitability and growth, which we prefer. We initiate our coverage with an overweight rating."

As a result, WIX has been free cash flow positive - and deeply so - for several years:(Source: Investor Presentation)WIX appears to be an easy-to-understand name seeing impressive growth, with a valuation made reasonable due to the broad market selloff (I’ll discuss the valuation below). Let’s now analyze the company's balance sheet.From the perspective of financial flexibility, WIX has a strong balance sheet with over $500 million in cash and short-term investments. The company has virtually no long-term debt and does have $359 million in convertible notes. These notes are due in 2023 with a conversion price of $142.63 per share. While WIX is currently far off that price, I do expect the stock to trade higher than $142 by 2023, if not much earlier. As a result, I have included these convertible notes in my calculation of shares outstanding below.WIX’s strong balance sheet and positive free cash flow generation mean that its financial position is not only rather strong during these periods of tumultuous times, but the company can even take advantage.It has extended its $100 million share repurchase program to June 2020. We will have to wait for the next earnings call to see if WIX repurchased any shares at these bargain basement valuations.WIX trades at only 7 times trailing sales, or 7.3 times assuming conversion of the convertible notes. While WIX is not currently GAAP profitable, I expect operating leverage to eventually lead to operating margins around 25% or higher. This would suggest that shares are trading at approximately 29 times “ultra-forward” earnings.My 12-month fair value estimate is $180, or 12 times forward sales. Shares have around 90% upside to that price target.The coronavirus and widespread market panic have created many buying opportunities - WIX looks like a fat pitch. With a strong balance sheet and solid growth, shares appear materially undervalued at around 7 times trailing revenues. I rate shares a Buy.(TipRanks: Buy WIX)"
4292710,102646,2019-09-20T13:56:25-04:00,"Wix has performed strongly as a public company.Like many of its SAAS peers, Wix stock has fallen sharply in the past one month.Wix has a risky business model with a high churn rate.","From a distance, Wix (WIX) appears to be a good investment. It is a SaaS company, with fast revenue growth, high gross margins, reasonable valuation, and more than 154 million users. However, when you look at the company closely, you realize that this is not a company you should be invested in. In this article, I will explain why the company's business model is risky and why investors should stay on the sidelines for now.Wix launched its IPO in 2013, raising more than $127 million. This valued the company at more than $750 million. This year, the company's valuation rose to more than $7.7 billion. From its IPO price, the company's stock price has risen by 670% compared to the S&P 500's total returns of 92%. This performance can be attributed to several factors such as the impressive revenue growth, the multiple successful product launches, and the overall SaaS industry the company operates in. However, in the past one month, the stock price has dropped by 12%. Other similar SaaS companies too have dropped as investors fear about weak corporate spending on IT. The chart below shows the performance of similar fast-growing SaaS companies in the past one month.As a person who has used Wix to build websites, I must admit that the product is one of the easiest one to use. With the ADI product, you can easily build a good-looking website within a few minutes. Therefore, there is no doubt that Wix has good product. As a result, the company has received very good reviews from its past clients.Also, the company has managed to grow its users to more than 154 million. To be clear, this 154 million number is of no value considering what Wix considers to be an active user. According to Wix, this number refers to all unique email addresses registered on Wix.com. The number of paying customers has increased from more than 790k in February 2014 to more than 4.3 million in the most recent quarter. This is a great growth in momentum.While this growth is commendable, I believe that the company's target audience is relatively weaker. This is because Wix mostly targets small businesses and individual bloggers. From a broader perspective, there is nothing wrong with this. However, the reality is that churn among this audience is relatively higher than for those SaaS companies like Salesforce (CRM) that target large enterprises. This is because most small businesses and startups fail within the first few years. The same is true for most bloggers. Most bloggers start their ventures with a lot of enthusiasm, which tends to fade within a few months. This is after they realize that blogging is not as easy an easy and profitable venture.While Wix does not report its churn rate, analysts believe that the number is significantly high. In a 2017 report by JPMorgan (JPM), the analysts said that monthly churn of premium users was 4%. This churn was more than double that of GoDaddy (GDDY). The same churn argument was talked about by Mark Zgutowicz of Rosenblatt, who downgraded the stock last month.In the near term, churn is not a big issue if the company can continue to add new users. This is because the old customers will be replaced by the new ones. However, in the long term, I believe that the cycle will catch up with the company.Wix has done a few things to boost its earnings as subscription growth slows. The company has moved to increase price for its premium users. I believe that in the long term, these price increases might turn away new subscribers who will go to other companies like SquareSpace and Weebly that provide a similar product.The company has increased innovation by launching a number of products. Some of the recent products were Corvid, which is targeted to developers. The product helps them build professional applications in a hassle-free environment. The company has also created e-commerce platform. This makes sense because it enables the current Wix users to sell products. It has also created a logo maker, Wix Playground, and an online booking system. These products are essential as the company continues to monetize its existing base. This has seen the company grow its ARPU as shown below. However, I think that these initiatives will continue being niche products. I don't think anyone will become a paying subscriber simply to use Corvid.Source: Seeking AlphaFinally, I believe that we have reached a period of saturation in the market. It is a period where a large population of the target market has a website. It is also a period where there are so many companies in the industry. Just recently, Webflow, a company that offers a better product than Wix raised $72 million. Further, GoDaddy has improved its web builder platform. This means that opportunities for further growth will be relatively limited.In 2018, Wix had more than $603 million in revenue. This was a great number for a company that had revenues of $9 million in 2010. Analysts expect the company's revenue to increase to $764 million this year and $1.18 billion in 2018. In 2018, the company lost more than $35 million. These losses will continue to increase as the company continues to invest for growth as is the case with many of its peers.As of this writing, the company is valued at more than $6.27 billion, which seems reasonable compared to Shopify's (SHOP) $37 billion. The company has more than $800 million in cash and more than $339 million in debt. This valuation means the company is valued 6.5x forward sales, which is also reasonable compared to SHOP's 17x multiple. Similarly, the company's forward EV to EBITDA multiple of 48 is reasonable compared to SHOP's 577.In addition, as shown on the chart below, the stock is trading below the 50-day and 100-day moving averages while the RSI has moved to the oversold level.Therefore, there is a case to be made that WIX is reasonably valued at these levels. However, factoring the fact that its business model appears to be weak, especially at a time of weakening global growth, I believe that the stock could fall further. In addition, the company's Risk of 40 score of 22 is relatively lower than the recommended 40. In this, I added the company's most recent revenue growth rate of 27% and the EBITDA margin of -5. Compare this with Shopify's 41.Wix is a great company with impressive revenue growth. The company's platform is also great for small businesses and bloggers. Unlike many SaaS companies, WIX does not seem to be very overvalued. Still, this does not mean that investors should invest in the company at the current level. At the same time, this does not mean that investors should short the company because of the ongoing irrational exuberance in the market. Instead, we recommend that long-term investors stay in the sidelines for now."

The company continues to prove skeptics wrong with strong growth. Many retail investors are quick to dismiss the company due to its substantial losses on the income statement, but I would argue these losses are not as significant as one might think. Wix generates large amounts of positive operating and free cash flow, has tons of cash on the balance sheet, and continues to grow quickly. The financials are reminiscent of a certain trillion-dollar company known as Amazon (AMZN), and I think every reader knows how that story turned out.Data by YChartsRevenue is expected to come in at $762M for the full 2019 year and grow another 25% in 2020. While this is a significant decline in percentage growth from the previous few years, it remains a respectable amount and certainly qualifies the company as a growth company.Source: TIKR.comNot only is WIX's revenue growing, but the majority of revenue is recurring. Furthermore, the switching costs for customers remain high, as many small and medium-size businesses want a simple way to have a basic website. Wix's freemium model and simple design process make it very easy for anybody to create a solid website, and they're unlikely to leave and have to create a whole new site once they're already on Wix.Many smaller businesses, at least from my own observations, still do not have a website. I also think personal websites are just beginning to gain popularity. These two observations lead me to believe there are still plenty of potential users out there, many of which Wix has a good chance of landing due to their freemium model. Furthermore, continued ventures into integrating e-commerce capabilities should help attract businesses. Analysts don't disagree, as they have the company nearly doubling revenue from 2019 by 2022.Source: Seeking Alpha Earnings EstimatesAlthough Wix isn't profitable, they are generating cash, and have been for some time. The company has been operating cash flow positive since 2015. Free cash flow continues to grow, allowing the company to buy back shares or find new investments.Source: TIKR.comSource: Wix Q3 2019 Earnings SlidesAs long as Wix keeps up strong cash flow, they'll have little need to seek funding elsewhere and can continue to exist, despite lacking profitability.Wix has a substantial amount of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities on the balance sheet. So, not only is the company generating cash, they also have a substantial pile of it to draw on if ever required. Shareholders can sleep well knowing the company is well-equipped to face any potential future headwinds.Source: Wix Q3 2019 SEC FilingOf course, a large pile of cash would be of little value if the company had a great deal of debt. Fortunately, Wix has virtually no traditional debt. The largest liability by far on the balance sheet are some convertible senior notes. I won't get into these now, but investors should be aware they exist.Wix is a company with strong growth that isn't over yet. Several more years of mid 20s percentage revenue growth should bring the company closer to profitability, and in the meantime, the company will continue to pump out cash. Existing customers are unlikely to switch to competitors and are introduced to Wix's platform through a model that only monetizes a user once they're happy with their website. This should ultimately lead to customer loyalty and continued strong recurring revenue. Wix could be making new all-time highs once again very soon.Source: Wix.comI'll be writing more articles on Wix in the future, as well as other great (or sometimes not so great) stocks.

4307211,103763,2019-11-15T19:06:48-05:00,"Wix continues to deliver robust growth with revenue growing by 26% y/y to $197m, and registered user base reaching 160m.Gross margin declined by ~6 percentage points y/y to 74% as a result of growth in Wix Payments and investments in Customer Solutions.Opportunity lies in expanded offerings like Corvid, which provides users the tools to innovate on top of the Wix platform and further breaks down friction points.We believe the market is underrating the sustainability of revenue growth - combined with a clean balance sheet and potential operating leverage, we see shares as a buy.","Wix.com (WIX) continues to be a leading software firm enabling businesses to build on top of their website development platform. The company has seen strong growth in their revenue coupled with sizable margins - this has led to a meteoric rise in shares which are up nearly 50% year-to-date. The company recently reported Q3 earnings, delivering continued growth across multiple areas.Source: Business InsiderThe software landscape is constantly changing - some companies see immediate product-market fit only to find their success temporary as larger firms take over in the blink of an eye. This is where the concept of an economic moat becomes essential – companies without a wide moat will be vulnerable to competitive forces. Unlike other software firms, when we look at Wix we see a company with a sizable moat and a great opportunity ahead of it.By removing barriers to entry - primarily technical skills associated with website development - Wix is enabling new businesses to flourish. At the same time, the company provides businesses with quality tools to create advanced applications which further grows their market opportunity. Adding in company-specific factors like a healthy balance sheet and the potential for operating leverage we see shares as an attractive investment.Wix’s top line has continued to grow at a robust rate, with Q3 seeing revenue reach $197M growing by 26% year-on-year. On a TTM basis, revenue is ~$721M and grew by ~29% year-on-year. Looking ahead, management previously guided FY19 revenue in the range of $761-765 million, representing growth of 26-27% year-on-year – Q3 guidance tightened the high end of this range by ~$2 million.Source: QuickFSWith new product offerings, such as Wix Code which caters to the developer community, the company is effectively expanding their TAM. We believe that innovation on behalf of Wix, as well as from companies on the Wix platform, will lead to a snowball effect in revenues as increased business is conducted on top the Wix platform.In 3Q19, Wix reported 160 million registered users up from 137 million in 3Q18 or 17% year-on-year. Premium subscribers came in at 4.4 million up from 3.8 million in the same quarter last year, or 15% growth y/y. As a percentage of total registered users, premium subscriber has remained flat. In 2Q14, premium subscribers as a percentage of total registered users was ~2%. By 3Q19, this expanded by around 80 basis points to ~2.8%.Source: Company FilingsPremium subscriber share of total registered users has expanded by less than one percentage point. Although conversions from registered users to premium have been rather slow, we also think that Wix is just in the early innings of what will be high-value product offerings. As this happens, not only will more conversions follow but there is also opportunity for higher value extraction per conversion. This was evident in Q3 as management noted significant growth in cohort customer lifetime value. On the Q3 press release, the company stated that:Through offerings like Corvid by Wix, which allows for advanced web applications to be constructed, the use cases for applications built on top of Wix will grow at a fast pace. Whereas previously the potential applications were limited (small business with static landing page) a new business on Wix today can create a web application using different application programming interfaces (""API"") where the sky is the limit. As friction points are removed, innovation on the platform is magnified.Margins in the quarter contracted quite a bit – non-GAAP gross margin came in at 74% versus 80% in 3Q18. Management mentions that the decline was attributable to the growth of Wix Payments which was launched in 4Q18. Operating expenses in the quarter came in at ~83% of sales, up from ~81% of sales in 3Q18. Both sales & marketing (“S&M”) and research & development (“R&D”) spend as a percentage of sales was higher relative to last year. In the long run, we are optimistic that R&D investments will pay off as new product offerings equate to larger economic opportunities. When it comes to S&M, we believe continued growth in revenue and strong retention could result in operating leverage.By building out new products and services for users, the company is setting the scene for innovation to take place on their platform. On top of this is the company’s heavy spend on sales & marketing (S&M) – we believe this is one area where the company will see operating leverage in. Combined, we see operating level margins reaching higher levels than they are today.Source: QuickFSFor a relative valuation, we compare Wix with peers that also provide businesses with a platform and key tools. Compared to the peer group, shares are valued below the median at ~10x EV/sales. We do believe the company warrants a premium but also think that the market is underestimating the sustainability of the company’s growth rate. Unlike many other peers in software, we believe Wix boasts a wide economic moat strengthened by the company’s industry-leading position.With few alternatives providing solutions as powerful as Wix, we believe that the company does hold pricing power – management also touched upon this in the press release citing pricing optimization efforts as a growth driver. All these factors combined paint Wix as a high-quality business. For investors with long-term holding periods, we see shares providing a healthy rate of return."

Investors may wish to scale into a position.As with all stock investments, holding a long position in Wix comes with significant risks.","With software company valuations at all-time highs, Wix.com Ltd. (WIX) is one of the few subscription-based software companies that is still a great investment opportunity. It provides website building tools for Do-It-Yourself (DIY) users. While the DIY website industry is highly competitive with players such as Squarespace, GoDaddy Inc. (GDDY) and Square Inc.'s (SQ) Weebly, Wix has managed to grow revenues at close to 50% annually for the past 5 years, while boasting more than 4 million subscriptions.Wix has been busy not only adding new functionality to its suite of products, but also transforming from a DIY web-building tool company to a platform aimed more at professional web developers and agencies. These activities should start to be reflected in the company’s financial performance later in 2019. Wix has strong revenue growth and free cash flow, and for these reasons, I give it a Buy rating.Recently, Wix has added several new applications: Ascend by Wix, Wix Turbo, Payments and Corvid by Wix. Ascend by Wix is a suite of features that can be used to provide CRM marketing tools. Wix Turbo improves website loading speed, which will improve the company’s competitive position. And in Q4 of last year, Wix launched a feature that allows sites to incorporate a payment feature.The last, and arguably the most important, development is Corvid by Wix. Corvid, originally called Wix Code, allows web developers to push the envelope on what was a very low-end HTML-based platform by adding custom code capabilities, APIs and database access into the mix.(Source: Wix Investor Presentation Slideshow)Wix has a history of continuous innovation that has kept revenues growing. It stands to reason that the recently added functionality will both attract new users and give a reason for existing customers to upgrade their subscriptions. I expect that these updates will maintain the company’s competitive position and we will start to see results later in 2019.(Source: Wix Investor Presentation Slideshow)Wix has approximately 150 million registered users with 4 million paid subscriptions. Its core product was a DIY web building platform, but it is transforming into a company that offers a suite of commerce tools to better meet the needs of agencies and developers. The company is also now focused more on optimizing revenues instead of converting free users into paid subscribers.For this reason, it has eliminated its lowest-cost subscription, adjusted the price of the remaining products and, as I mentioned earlier, has added Corvid, the company's new, high-end product. The result has been a flattening out of conversions, but 25% more revenues brought in per new customer.As I explained in my last article on Alteryx (AYX), high-growth companies generally don't measure up based on traditional value metrics. In fact, they often confound analysts, with the result being a lost investment opportunity. In place of traditional value factors, I generally focus on other measures, such as revenue growth, the software company ""Rule of 40,"" and my favorite: company performance relative to analyst estimates.Wix had a great year with trailing-twelve-month (TTM) revenue growth of 36%. The company's 5-year annual growth rate of 50% is also quite good. (Source: Portfolio123.com)Wix's free cash flow margin TTM has been positive since late 2015, and is currently at a very healthy 17% of revenues.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Having positive free cash flow and high growth makes this an interesting investment opportunity.Gross margin was a point of concern in the Q1 2019 Results - Earnings Call Transcript. As can be seen in the chart below, the gross margin has been falling since mid-2017.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Company management responded to the falling gross margin with the following:Examining how a company performs versus analysts' estimates gives me a feel for how conservative the management is and how well they communicate with the investment community. This is a good predictor of what to expect in future quarterly results. With that said, Wix has a good record of beating analysts' estimates. The company has exceeded estimates for the last five quarters for sales, while missing EPS estimates once in the most recent quarter.(Source: Portfolio123.com)The missed earnings are primarily due to the additional $15 million spend to increase the “customer solution organization” globally, an initiative meant to generate higher conversion and improve customer satisfaction.Analysts are challenged when it comes to valuing software companies. While these companies tend to generate high revenue growth rates, they also tend to be unprofitable due to large investments in research & development and sales and marketing. Discounting future cash flows requires many assumptions that are typically unreliable and difficult to support.One industry metric that is often used for early- to mid-stage software companies is the ""Rule of 40."" It is an industry rule of thumb that attempts to help software companies ascertain how to balance growth and profitability. There are different ways of calculating the Rule of 40; some analysts use EBITDA, and others use free cash flow margin. I use the free cash flow margin, as the figure is useful in a later part of my analysis.Some analysts interpret the Rule of 40 as follows: If a company's growth rate is at least 40 percentage points higher than its free cash flow margin, then a high-growth SaaS company can burn cash in order to drive growth.Wix is burning cash. S&GA expenses are 84% of revenues, higher than what would be expected from a more mature software company that would typically have a figure around 50-60%.(Source: Portfolio123.com)Note that SG&A includes Sales & Marketing, General & Administrative and R&D.On the other hand, Wix’s SG&A expense is more reasonable than some other stocks that I have analyzed recently, such as Okta (OKTA), which has more than 100% SG&A as a percentage of revenues.According to the Rule of 40, the cash burn is OK so long as revenue growth plus free cash flow margin adds up to 40% or more.Revenue Growth + FCF margin = 36% + 17% = 55%In the case of Wix, the cash burn appears to be ""acceptable.""Revenue growth plus FCF margin is sometimes referred to as the ""Efficiency Score."" It has been determined that Efficiency Score has a greater than 70 percent correlation to a public SaaS company's revenue multiple, which is the valuation divided by revenue.In order to demonstrate this, I have plotted the EV/Sales multiple versus the Efficiency Score in MS Excel for 48 software stocks from my Digital Transformation stock list. A linear trend line is plotted through the scatter plot that represents the best-fit valuation multiple for a given Efficiency Score.(Source: Portfolio123.com/MS Excel)As can be seen from the above graph, the Wix valuation (EV/Sales) is below the best-fit line through the data points.The rest of this analysis is somewhat controversial. For me at least, it seems logical to assume higher valuation for higher-growth companies, and I use the best-fit line to gauge a company's valuation relative to the rest of the stocks in the custom universe. This is a relative valuation, not absolute as one would attempt to get using a DCF calculation.Based on the above chart, I conclude that Wix stock price is undervalued relative to the rest of the digital transformation stocks in my custom universe. Therefore, I assign a Buy rating for this stock.An investment in Wix comes with several risks. For starters, the stock market bull market is long in the tooth, and we could enter a bear market in the not-too-distant future based on a slowing economy or a resurgence in trade tensions between USA and China.In addition, SaaS stocks are on a tear, and many of them are reaching all-time highs. Some analysts believe that we are in for a second ""dot-com"" crash due to lofty valuation levels.Also, the market for website-building tools is quite competitive, and if new product initiatives fail to be adopted by developers, then Wix’s business could be adversely affected.Wix is located in Israel, but much of the development is done in the United States. If the USD rises significantly, then expenses will also rise, resulting in worse numbers than should normally be expected.Wix offers a subscription-based DIY website builder platform that has YoY revenue growth of 36% and is likely to achieve significant growth for several years as a result of new features recently added. The company scores quite well on the Rule of 40. I believe it is fairly valued relative to other software stocks, and I assign a Buy rating to Wix.This investment comes with significant risks, however. All digital transformation-enabling stocks have lofty values. At some point in time, these companies may come down to earth. But I believe that Wix, with its more reasonable valuation, is a buying opportunity and investors should not miss out. Investors may want to scale into a position instead of jumping in headfirst if they believe that there may be a correction in the near future.Keep an eye out for my soon-to-be-launched Digital Transformation marketplace service!"

Wix has helped simplify a process that used to take hours to develop and reduced it to less than an hour. The company’s growth strategy is that of creating an ecosystem of tools to empower their customers in various ways. The CRM tools help them communicate with their customers while Ascend helps them in marketing and promoting their products.Source: Seeking AlphaThis year, the company’s stock has gained by 57% and in the past three years, it has gained by more than 400%. For a stock that has been on a sustained upward trend, investors might be worried about whether it can gain some more. From a distance, they are right. Furthermore, the loss-making company with revenues of below $1 billion is currently valued at more than $7 billion. It has a pricey forward price to sales ratio of 7.50. This article will explain why the company’s stock could continue moving upwards. The bullish argument is that the fears of competition and valuation are unwarranted.There are a number of reasons why the company’s stock has been on an upward trend. First, in general, technology stocks have outperformed the overall market. In the first six months of the year, the Nasdaq index gained by more than 22%, which was better than the Dow Jones’ 14%. This is because technology companies are seeing impressive growth.Second, among the technology companies, those that offer SAAS services have made more gains. Examples are companies like Hubspot (HUBS), Shopify (SHOP), Twilio (TWLO), Okta (OKTA) and Zoom Video (ZM) have gained by 36%, 115%, 52%, 93%, and 43% respectively.Third, Wix has been adding more users to its platform. The company has more than 148 million registered users. This number has grown from just 46 million in the first quarter of 2014. The number of paying customers has increased from below 1 million in Q1’14 to more than 4.1 million in Q1’19. This is an impressive growth. For a SAAS company, success is also measured on the average revenue per user. For Wix, the ARPU has increased from $137 in Q4’16 to $168 in Q1’19.Source: Seeking AlphaFourth, Wix user growth has led to increase in revenues as well. The company’s annual revenues have grown from $43 million in 2012 to more than $603 million in 2018. In 2019, 2020, and 2021, the company is expected to generate revenues of $762 million, $954 million, and $1.15 billion. At the same time, the company has continued to make losses as the management invest in growth. This is something that is so common among tech and growth companies.Wix operates in an industry that is crowded where there are few proprietary things. The biggest company in the industry is Wordpress, which has a more than 60% market share in the content management industry. Wix has a small market share as shown below.Source: KinstaObviously, the fact that Wix has a smaller market cap is not a good thing. In SAAS, this is not usually a good thing because the company has limited options for raising prices. When it does, it might turn-off new customers, who will opt for lower-priced alternatives. However, Wix does not need to be the market leader in the industry to succeed because of the size of the market. In fact, most of the companies that it competes with were founded way before it. While Wix was founded in 2006, SquareSpace, Wordpress, and Joomla were founded in 2003, 2003, and 2005 respectively. As such, the company has continued to grow its market share in spite of the increased competition.This competition will remain. What the company needs to do is to maintain the current premium customers and convert more free customers to paid ones. The company is doing this by creating an ecosystem that can keep the customers on its platform.The entry product for Wix customers is the website design platform. In this, customers pay a monthly fee of between $4 to $24 a month and are then able to build and host their websites. In recent years, the company has increased its suite of product from just basic products to e-commerce platform. The e-commerce platform is now competing directly with Shopify.After a business user creates their website, they will need additional tools such as customer service, chats, sales and marketing, forms, and comments among others. When these products are bought, Wix takes a 30% cut. The company has also developed its own verticals like Wix Hotels, Wix Bookings, and Wix Music as it tries to improve its own ecosystem. An evidence of this increased spending per customer is shown on the average revenue per user data, which has been increasing. As the company continues to increase more capabilities, there is a likelihood that the ARPU will continue.Source: Seeking AlphaTherefore, Wix is a company in transition and the historic growth might not last. In fact, as shown in figure 1 above, the number of premium user growth is not growing as fast as it used to. Still, the company will continue to generate returns by continuing to monetize the existing customers while still adding more customers. An evidence of this is in the growth of free cash flow as shown on the chart below.Source: YChartsFrom a distance, Wix appears overvalued. Furthermore, this is a loss-making company with annual revenues of below $1 billion and one that is valued at more than $7.1 billion. The company will also not be profitable any time soon. However, a closer look show that its valuation is just fine, when you consider that it has a YoY revenue growth of more than 40%. Since the company is still making losses, it is impossible to compare it using the PE ratios. Therefore, the most ideal metric is the EV to revenue and price to sales multiples.Using the past twelve months, the company’s EV to revenue multiple is at 10.44. As shown below, this is lower than those of its closest peers like Shopify, Adobe, Okta, and Hubspot.Source: YChartsSince investors are forward oriented, when the revenue estimates are used, the company is still undervalued compared to its rivals as shown below.Source: YChartsThe same trend emerges when you compare it with the other companies using the forward price to sales information. This is shown in the chart below.Source: YChartsTherefore, using the PS and EV to EBITDA metrics, Wix is not entirely an overvalued company when compared with its peers. Another way to look at it is to use the recent Tableau (DATA) acquisition by Salesforce (CRM). At the acquisition price, DATA had an EV to Revenue ratio of 12, which is higher than that of WIX which is at 10.The big question is whether the company can continue to improve its profitability. A good way to think about this is to see whether the company will ever be profitable. As mentioned, the company is expected to generate more than $760 million. If the company can have the same EBITDA margin of 15%, the same as that of GoDaddy (GDDY), the company would have an EBITDA of $114 million. Using today’s market valuation of $7 billion, it means that – in this hypothetical example – it is trading at ~61x 2021 EBITDA. This is a similar valuation to that of fellow SAAS companies, Salesforce (CRM) and Adobe, which have a ratio of 52 and 59 respectively.Finally, there is the issue of the company’s private offering in 2018. In it, the company raised more than $385 million from several qualified institutional investors. At the time, the stock price was priced at $105. The funds raised were convertible senior notes that were supposed to expire in 2023 and the conversion price was $142. Having reached this level and to avoid dilution of shareholders, the company extended the price to $211 - ~47% premium from the current level. In the most recent earnings call, the company’s CFO said the following:While the debt holders might be wrong on Wix, there is a likelihood that they expect the company to perform well in the next few years.The short interest in Wix has risen to more than 1.5 million shares as investors are concerned about the growth of the company. While there are valid reasons to be cautious about the company, this article has explained reasons why investors should not be worried about investing in the company. While the industry is competitive, Wix has proven that it can grow by adding more customers and increasing the average revenue per user by adding more capabilities. In addition, while Wix is not as cheap as it was a few years ago, the company’s valuation is not as ridiculous, especially for a company that has an annual revenue growth of more than 40%."
4225516,89855,2018-11-29T16:57:30-05:00,The website builder Wix has built a high-growth business with sound financials unlike other technology and internet companies.Recent volatility has sold off the stock heavily from its highs despite meeting management expectations.This article explains how the fair value of the company points to upside of up to 40% over the next year.,"As volatility becomes vogue once again, the market has begun to washout a wave of companies that were overvalued – alarmingly so in many cases. The variety of factors driving lofty valuations have been discussed frequently on Seeking Alpha, with some combination of tax cuts, economic cyclicality, and poor yield alternatives being popular and well sourced arguments. Given the turn in the market – dare we say the transition to a bear market or correction – the companies that were carried by macro factors and not sound fundamentals, are selling off at sharp rates. Earnings reports merely meeting guidance are getting hammered, leaving investors scratching their heads on how their 401K can be down on the year. Wix.com Ltd (WIX) is not one of these companies. With a strong and innovative platform to leverage thanks to heavy R&D investment, Wix.com has firmly established itself as a leader in its space. Unlike some competitors that have been pigeonholed in a nice such as Shopify (SHOP) which targets itself toward an e-commerce market, Wix has positioned itself to serve not only e-commerce, but has taken strides to capture bloggers and small businesses alike. While a website developed from scratch may win in functionality in side-by-side comparison if a business has unique needs, Wix can likely produce similar functionality for less than the cost of the developer’s billable hours for a single day of coding. This is a powerful argument for adoption of the platform and the primary driver of why the company has found success to date. Continue reading to see why the current valuation of Wix is too low and deserves a look by prudent investors.Digging into the numbers shows a clear strategy to balance user acquisition with monetization. Management is spending the money in R&D to keep the platform competitive and is seeing high ROI on advertising. Once a user begins on the Wix platform, they are likely to stay on the platform – something management knows and is positioning itself to handle.As seen below, in the third quarter, revenue was up 40% year over year, with guidance placing fiscal growth at 41% year over year. This follows three periods of fiscal growth that bounced around mid-40%, although the revenue drivers are shifting relative to past periods from a pure subscriber growth to higher monetization of subscribers.Source: Wix Q3 Earnings Slides This point is demonstrated in the two charts below that explain how the company can be generating 40% growth despite subscribers growing at a lesser rate. Registered users were up 20% year over year to 137M, but premium subscribers were up 26% year over year to 3.8M. While the penetration of premium subscriptions is low, the percentage has been slowly creeping up by a fraction of a percentage point each of the previous fiscal years. This trend has continued through 2018, as management has continued to prioritize product offerings that work to flip users to subscribers. A quick back of the napkin calculation shows that $1B in revenue will be easy to achieve in the coming years as average subscription size increases and users adopt premium plans.Source: Wix Q3 Earnings SlidesOnce users are on the platform, management knows they are likely to stay on the platform once their website is built out and they are comfortable with the product. We can slice this in many directions, including a discussion on advertising and new user acquisition, but we will comment on how this allows some price inelasticity for management. The moving cost of leaving the Wix platform and establishing an online presence with another provider (or developed in-house) greatly outweighs incremental price increases. Considering how inexpensive the product offerings already are, this leaves huge room to run for Wix. Considering the cost of competitors, it’s easy to not be excited about the one-two punch of churn into premium customers at increased rates.Source: Wix Q3 Earnings Slides Source: Wix Q3 Earnings Slides Financial analysis on Wix has been done in detail by prior authors and in an effort to abbreviate this article – we will focus on quarterly updates and provide commentary on overall strength. While Wix has yet to post a GAAP operating profit, the Company is performing extremely well given its focus on growth. Through the first nine months of 2018, Wix reported a decreased net loss and improved cash flow rate despite an uptick in R&D and advertising (selling & marketing).Source: Wix Q3 Earnings Release An astute investor will note that in backing out non-cash expenses and accounting for working capital fluctuations, that the company is operating much leaner than the P&L suggests. Share based compensation alone had a P&L hit of over $50M and considering the net loss reported of ($32M), more than accounted for the loss on the year. When realizing that the losses generated are merely paper losses, it becomes easy to realize that the cash flow thrown off by the company is staggeringly high ($80M) for its stage of development. Many tech and online companies fail to generate positive cash flows, but WIx is already generating robust cash flow while still growing at high rates.The balance sheet also remains extremely healthy – with the majority of liabilities tied to deferred revenue from premium subscriptions. Even after raising $333M in convertible notes (at 0%), deferred revenue still makes up over one-third of liabilities on the balance sheet. Working capital already looks strong at face value due to the influx of capital from the convertible notes, but after adjusting for deferred revenue is a staggering $635M in nearly all cash or cash equivalents.Wix has walked the tight rope of balancing growth and market expansion, with building a strong balance sheet and done so marvelously. Investors should feel very confident in management to continue to allocate capital efficiently and should expect big things with the available liquidity on the balance sheet.Unlike other companies that have sold heavily off their highs in 2018, Wix appears to be trading at a relatively substantial discount to fair value after the movement. With a 52 week range between $50 - $121, and the stock sitting at approximately $90 as we type this article, investors may question how we can view more upside in the name. After all, nearly doubling over the course of the last 52 weeks is nothing to complain about.The answer to our valuation lies in the price to sales ratio (P/S). All of the information we have discussed to this point bridges the gap for investors on why the company is strong and will continue to grow, but doesn’t address valuation or where the stock should trade at. For companies that are still experiencing high growth, but limited earnings (intentionally or not), we feel that discounting cash flow unfairly penalizes companies that are focusing resources on user growth. While cash flow may be the life blood of a business in the long-run, focusing on the flows for Wix discounts the fact that their strong balance sheet (as discussed above) supports their growth phase.Currently Wix trades at a Price to Sales ratio of about 7.5x. While we view the multiple to be low relative to their growth trajectory, for this valuation exercise, we will make the assumption that that market is fairly assigning a multiple as of today. Taking management’s revenue guidance at its mid-point ($601.5M for 2018), and extrapolating growth rates – albeit conservatively lower – to 30% and 20% over the next two fiscal periods, we see that the even taking the current market multiple would price the stock much higher than the stock is currently trading within the next year.We highlighted the multiples the give readers a quick reference for our valuation, where it can be seen that for 2019, the expected range should be $113 to $129. This assumes no multiple expansion (something that should happen but we discounted for this analysis) and a reduction in growth rates for the year to only 30%. Management has not provided full year guidance for 2019 yet, but given historical performance, we are confident that it will be at or higher than we project. Should guidance fall lower, investors should adjust their price target.Source: Author’s forecast (future data), past data (Wix Earnings Reports)In reviewing analyst updates and notes, as a whole we see Wall Street coverage that supports our target price range for the stock. Finviz calculates an analyst target price of $114, which includes coverage by Raymond James (outperform), Wedbush (outperform), and RBC Capital Market (outperform). Needham has a Buy rating on the stock, as does Jefferies and Suntrust (although coverage updates may go back as far as 2017).We reviewed analyst notes on the stock after we performed our initial due diligence and valuation and were pleased to see the consensus price target fall within our conservative range. While this may seem relatively coincidental, keep in mind that many of these price targets came out mid-year when the stock was trading over $100. This supports our thesis that the selloff was unwarranted and that the company has fallen deeply below fair value.Source: Finviz Quote and Data SummaryWix meets all the criteria in our book for a buy / long recommendation. The company has a product that the market wants, demonstrated by continued user adoption of both the free product and churn to premium subscriptions. The financial position of the company checks out, with an arsenal of cash ready to generate new ideas and acquire new users. Wall Street analysts are also high on the stock, supporting our bullish sentiment.Above all else, the valuation of the company checks out, with upside of up to 40% in the next year based on current trading in the low $90s.We recommend establishing a long position in shares or long-dated call options if the volume of contracts being traded can establish a fair exit value. Embrace the volatility of the market and be greedy when others are fearful."
4237735,103763,2019-02-03T20:02:15-05:00,"When considering Wix's increased product offering and early penetration rates, along with the fragmented state of key markets, the revenue outlook is bright.The company boasts over $715 million in cash and short-term investments, and less than half of that (~$340 million) in total debt. A strong balance sheet allows Wix to pursue efforts to drive strong.On an adjusted basis, we believe the company’s performance is quite impressive. Factoring out its heavy R&D expenses, Wix’s operating margin comes in at ~30%.The firm currently trades at ~21x FY19 EV/EBIT. When factoring in recent growth and potential that lies ahead, we believe shares are attractively valued.","Wix.com, Ltd. (WIX) has proven to be a lucrative holding for early shareholders. The company’s shares have risen by over 6-fold since its IPO opening price of ~$17, translating into a compounded annual return of 43%. Given the rampant growth witnessed over the past few years, investors are questioning whether Wix still has upside potential.SourceAfter diving into the company, we believe Wix shares still have a significant amount of runway left for growth. The company’s top line continues to show bright growth prospects, alongside impressive performance metrics. When combined with the firm’s strong balance sheet, we believe shares are more than reasonably valued and could provide investors with an enticing annual rate of return over the next several years.Over the years, Wix has seen subscriber count reach impressive levels, with growth occurring at breakneck speed. Since 3Q14, Wix has grown its number of registered users by ~29% per year on average. In the most recent quarter (3Q18), the number of registered users grew by ~20% year on year, reaching 137 million. Premium subscribers, on the other hand, has grown at an average rate of over 40% per year since 3Q14 - yet, the count for premium subscribers is only ~3.8 million.When spreading out year-on-year growth rates, critics may be quick to point out that growth has, in fact, been decelerating. Yet, we believe the deceleration in growth is appropriate and not the end of the world for Wix. After all, growth rates are still in the double-digit arena. Laying out the handful of efforts the company is pursuing to sustain growth, along with the sizable opportunities at hand, we are confident that management will be able to generate continued double-digit growth rates in Wix’s user count for years to come.Premium subscribers as a percentage of total registered users have been increasing over the past few years, although at a pace which may not excite many investors. Since 2014, Wix’s premium subscribers (% of total registered users) has expanded by ~100 basis points, from 1.8% in 3Q14 to 2.8% in 3Q18. With premium subscribers contributing directly to the firm’s top line, continued conversions would certainly be a positive. As management expands the company’s product offering, conversions should be well-supported.The increased number of Wix products is a result of management’s constant focus on maximizing its total addressable market - a thought process we believe is underrated. In the firm’s 2018 Investor Day presentation, its chief executive officer noted that roughly 10% of the world’s websites are created by novices - i.e., consumers who are tech savvy yet not experienced developers. The remaining 90% of websites are created by experienced website developers (referred to as experts). As a result, Wix recently created a product which would address the remaining 90% of the website development market.Of course, one must factor in the countless other firms it is now competing with in this space. Although it would be unrealistic to believe that the firm will capitalize on the entirety of the newly expanded TAM, even a percentage of such a market would prove to be lucrative. Ultimately, this mindset is incredibly beneficial, and a key quality we believe is worth mentioning. Aside from Wix’s entrance into the developer community, we are optimistic that continued penetration into the company’s geographic area of operations will drive revenue growth into the future. The two fastest-growing regions in 3Q18 were North America and Europe, growing by 43% and 41% year on year, respectively. Close behind was Asia, growing at 38% year on year. Currently, Wix is in the early stages of product rollout in lucrative regions such as Europe and Asia. Product offerings in the Asian region are specialized, with many markets in a fragmented state.Going forward, we believe that Wix will continue to see healthy overall user growth stemming from continued penetration into large regions. This growth will go hand-in-hand with an increased product offering and healthy conversion rate into premium subscribers. With some markets in a fragmented state, the firm also has an opportunity to generate strong market share growth through consolidation. Together, these factors pave the road for continued top line growth.On top of the bright prospects, the company boasts strong performance metrics, which make the revenue opportunities worthwhile. Currently, management is pouring heavy amounts of capital into research & development (“R&D”). Over the past several years, it has spent over 30% per year on average in R&D. As a result, the firm has been operating at a loss on paper. When backing out R&D spend, management could have had the option to make Wix immensely profitable. Instead, it has prioritized reinvesting capital into the business, which portrays a long-term mindset focused on growth and value creation. Backing out R&D expenses, the firm’s operating margin has proven to be quite impressive. Since 2016, Wix’s adjusted operating margin has expanded from ~8% to nearly 30%.The company also boasts quite a healthy balance sheet, with ~$320 million in cash and equivalents and ~$300 million in short-term investments. On the flip side, total debt is just $340 million. Such a financial position provides Wix elbow room to lever up its balance sheet and aggressively carry out growth efforts. Whether this be through rampant M&A in one of its low-penetration geographic markets or simply through share repurchases, management has an array of options. Aside from opening doors to future opportunities, the company’s strong balance sheet is a factor which we believe warrants a valuation premium.When attempting to value Wix, it’s important to keep in mind that management has control over a metaphorical profit lever. That is, it could have made the company profitable quite a while ago. Despite this, management decided to plow capital back into the business. As a result, adjustments are necessary to see the true colors of the business. Currently, Wix trades at an EV/EBIT of ~32x in the LTM ($4.8 billion EV over an adjusted LTM EBIT of ~$152 million). On a forward-looking basis, shares look even more enticing: ~21x FY19 adjusted EBIT. When considering the rate at which the firm is growing, as well as the future growth prospects, the current valuation is more than reasonable. If anything, it’s quite enticing. Adjusted operating income grew by 59% year on year in 3Q18. In previous quarters, year-on-year growth rates for operating income have been even higher. At current valuations, the firm is trading less than 1x its EBIT growth rate.With analysts expecting $760 million in FY19 revenue, a 30% adjusted operating margin would turn up $228 million in operating income. At a 25x EV/EBIT, Wix’s enterprise value would be $5.7 billion. Factoring in total cash of $715 million and total debt of $340 million (net debt of $375 million), we arrive at a market capitalization of ~$6.1 billion. Divided by 48.35 million shares outstanding, we arrive at a share price of ~$126. We initiate a Buy rating and a $126 PT, reflecting upside of ~14%. Over the next several years, we foresee Wix maintaining an annual double-digit growth rate, providing long-haul investors with an enticing compounded annual rate of return."
4250832,98236,2019-03-25T12:20:41-04:00,"Wix shares have been relatively flat for at least the last 6 months with minimal appreciation.The company reported strong operational performance last quarter with beats in most major metrics including growth and cash flow generation.The company's guidance, which called for revenue growth of 26% was disappointing to many.The company does not include newer products in its forecast, potentially leading to substantial overattainment.The shares are valued at a modest level, far below some other IT names that have reached stratospheric valaions.","Timing in life is said to be everything. We had the opportunity to visit with the General Manager of Wix, USA, Joe Pollaro on Wednesday. Of course Wednesday happened to be the day Wix shares took off and made back most of what they had lost in late February, when the company reported earnings and provided what some thought was disappointing guidance. That said, our interview was not for the purpose of figuring out how to trade Wix shares but to try to determine just how realistic the guidance was and what might be the upsides and market position of the company.This is not an article about the market as a whole, or the market for tech stocks. But I can’t help but observe that Wix (WIX) occupies a middle ground between the crème de la crème of the hyper-growth universe, and everything else. Logically, it seems to this writer as though investors are going to look for names that are a little bit less highly valued than the prominent elite, but which do not have the issues associated with the more controversial names in the IT space. Wix shares, currently selling at an EV/S of about 7X are perhaps not cheap-but they are hardly are priced at the stratospheric levels that now are the norm for the “best” of the hyper-growth IT names.Mr. Pollaro has been with Wix since 2014. Before that he was an investment banker at JP Morgan where he specialized in the Internet and Digital Media area. He generally serves as the point of contact for American investors and analysts-it should be noted that Wix is headquartered in Israel.I have written about Wix several times now; the last time I wrote about the name for SA was a bit more than a year ago, but I have published several blogs on the company on my Ticker Target. Com web site. As previously mentioned, Wix announced the results of its fiscal 2018 year and fourth quarter late last month. While the results themselves were quite strong with a noticeable beat in terms of revenues and earnings, the problem was the company’s forecast which was disappointing enough such that the shares fell by 16% from their high point, to their recent low earlier this month. Today’s move has made back a bit more than half of that fall. The move comes on the heels of a positive initiation from Guggenheim-but I am not inclined to think that was the major factor in the appreciation in the last couple of days.Wix shares, as will be discussed later in this article, are considerably undervalued in terms of the company’s EV/S ratio when compared to a very modest 3-year growth estimate of just greater than 30%. And the company’s free cash flow margin is greater than average for its growth rate cohort. I think that investors are starting to realize that this company’s valuation is one of the last bargains to be had in the midst of escalating valuations for the strongest growth names.Wix has had a habit of guiding to growth rates that are less than might be realistically expected as it excludes revenue from its newest products for which it has no substantial experience in making its forecast. Much of the time that hasn’t proven to be a huge factor in terms of the company’s subsequent performance. It seems likely, based on our conversation on Wednesday, that this year it might be reasonable to expect that the company expects to noticeably exceed the growth rate to which it guided. The most important factor in that expectation is that this is the year in which it expects to achieve a substantial revenue contribution from Wix Code after about a 1-year gestation period.The company is expecting that this will be a year in which it starts to sell to creative agencies and enterprises and to develop clients with an ACV in the 6-figure range or even higher. Its forecast is based on spending an extra $15-$20 million to develop a dedicated enterprise sales force, but the forecast doesn’t include any revenue from sales that are likely to come from that channel. This creates an excellent set-up for consistent quarters of beat and raise throughout the course of next year and is the core of the rationale to own the shares, I believeWix has been around for a considerable period and for most of its life it has sold tools to create web sites to the consumer/civilian market. These days, somewhat incredibly to this writer, the company is still getting more than 2 million registered users each month and that figure continues to rise. There is, no doubt, a social commentary that might be made about just how many people are creating web sites and who might have the time or the inclination to interact with all of those sites. Over time, there is more demand for people to evaluate web site builders than there is demand for new entrants in the space. But that is the business on which the core of Wix has been built and it continues to drive growth in the mid 20% range.A couple of years ago, Wix enhanced its offering by adding an AI component to its tool set and this feature created a fair amount of excitement and helped the company sustain growth of close to 40%. Wix continue to be thought to offer the leading set of tools for citizen web developers, and it has certainly been successful in competing against smaller rivals and in some cases, driving them out of the North American market.But like many IT vendors, the future for Wix will be its ability to drive its technology into the enterprise and to persuade professional web developers and designers to use it tools, either in agencies or in the enterprise. That is the market for which Wix Code was developed, and it is one of the principle opportunities that are not really well recognized by many investors and analysts at this point.Wix Code is exceptionally highly rated by 3rd party evaluators such as a firm with the felicitous name of Website Builders. It has a rating quite a bit higher than competitors. I have never used Code and I doubt that I ever will. But according to what I have been able to determine, Code allows users to utilize a vast array of information that can automatically populate web sites with pages and content. I could go through some of the things that Code can do, that cannot be readily done any other way. But that wouldn’t really do much for making the investment case for Wix.Suffice to say, if one has a web site design studio, or runs the promotional efforts of an enterprise using social media and other applications, Wix Code offers functionality and productivity that has not been available in some other solution till now. Code resides in the Wix editor and so far Wix does not charge a premium price for Code. I imagine the company will establish separate premium pricing plans for Code as part of its marketing push selling to creative web development agencies.Code has been available for about a year now, and it has generated some revenue for the company. But according to Joe Pollaro, this will be the year that Code generates a noticeable amount of revenue. How much-well Wix management doesn’t really know and thus it estimated essentially zero when it put together guidance. But it seemed clear to me during our conversation that Mr. Pollaro is exceptionally optimistic and I would interpret his commentary to suggest that Code will add several hundred points to the growth rate above the level the company has forecast.Wix has launched several other products, which are not included in guidance, but which may have some noticeable impact on results during 2019 and beyond. Two of those solutions are Ascend by Wix and Wix Turbo. Again, based on my conversation with Mr. Pollaro, I think Ascend by Wix, which is a suite of 20 products that can be used as a form of a CRM solution (my definition, not his), has a substantial, although unquantified revenue potential. These days, Wix has about 4 million paying users-even a 1% penetration for Ascend would add about $10 million/year in annual revenues on a current estimated revenue base of $760 million. For a SMB business that is looking for a simple way to track user interactions, and is already working with a Wix built web site, adding Ascend would seem to be a very logical decision. I imagine the attach rate will be far greater than 1% of the current installed base and will be at least double digits for new Wix users. Ascend is also not included in the company’s 2019 top-line forecast.Wix has also introduced a set of features that it calls Turbo. Turbo was introduced within the last 30 days and its business impact has yet to be determined. For many web site owners, speed is a big deal. It is said that a 1 second delay in loading can reduce conversions by 7% and 40% of consumers will leave a site that has a load time of greater than 3 seconds. Lots of very impatient users.Turbo is not a separately charged product and its features are available with all of the company’s plans. It will, apparently, however, improve the company’s competitive position. The following quote comes from TechCo, and the entire article can be found through this link.“Wix is considered one of the best website builders on the market today, and our own extensive testing has seen it rise above its peers in our results. As well as the speed improvements of Wix Turbo, the website builder boasts one of the most extensive catalogs of helpful features that do more for you and your site. Plus, with an AI-powered site developer built into the platform, you don’t have to be a pro to build a high-quality website.”Presumably, Turbo will improve the company’s market share, but again, it is impossible to say just how much these performance improvements might add to revenue above the forecast.Wix has also launched its payments capability which allows developers to include a payment feature within the sites that they build. The product was rolled out in the US in Q4 and it should start generating some revenues in the next few quarters. Unlike Code, Ascend and Turbo, the company has included some modest forecast for revenues associated with its payment product in the current forecast. Payments has proven to be a big deal for the closest Wix analog company, Shopify (SHOP), but of course essentially 100% of Shopify’s customers have built a store whose function is to take payments. That is far less true for Wix and thus it would probably not appropriate to try to extrapolate the impact that payments has had for SHOP onto the Wix base.One of the issues that frequently crops up in discussing Wix is competition. There are lots of web site builders and lots of individuals who want to launch web site builders. There is a certain logic to that. A company such as Wix is still adding 150k paying users/quarter and is still averaging around 2 million additional registered users per month. Entrepreneurial coders see those statistics and wonder how they can get a piece of the action. Sadly, most of them fail and the market is really far more concentrated than many readers might imagine.Wix has been the most prominent company in its space for some time now, and competition is certainly not increasing, and may be lessening according to Mr. Pollaro. That is one of those contentions that is very hard to measure-there certainly isn’t an agreed way of determining market share in the web building space.The leading competitors are Wordpress, GoCentral, Weebly and Squarespace.I doubt that there is any way to evaluate all of the competitors and decide who has the “best” solution. That said, one can get plenty of advice on the subject from a variety of sources. I have linked here with the work of a couple of analysts who writes about features and functions in the space. One likes Wix and the other recommends Squarespace.In terms of market share, Wix has enjoyed the top spot for a long time. I have linked here to one study that looks at market share. I think it is fair to say that Weebly was willing to sell itself to Square because of demand and financial issues. Wordpress is open source technology and has been a favorite of developers. Wix Code is likely to have a material impact on Wordpress. Most users think that GoDaddy’s Go Central has too many limitations and less flexibility than the competition. Because it belongs to GoDaddy it will be around indefinitely, but it is not a particular focus of GoDaddy. The reviews I have seen suggest that Squarespace has a competitive product that some users find attractive compared to the Wix offering That said, Squarespace is much smaller than Wix and lacks the sales and marketing clout of its larger rival. It is a private company and has been around for 16 years without really showing breakout performance.I got no sense that Wix has been having demand issues for any reason, but certainly it is not losing market share at this time to any of its best-known competitors according to Mr. Pollaro.One of the more inevitable concomitants of talking to a country general manager is that an interlocutor such as this writer is not likely to secure a plethora of financial data. Wix reported a month ago, and as mentioned, the results that it reported were more than satisfactory. Just to refresh the recollection of readers-Wix revenues grew by 38%; non-GAAP operating income more than doubled and reached a 12% margin, free cash flow rose by 67% for the quarter and by 45% for the year. These numbers all handily beat published prior consensus expectations. I should note that readers should subtract a few hundred basis points from the reported revenue growth rate due to the impact of the changed relationship between Wix and Google (GOOG) in which Wix gets to count more revenue from the relationship, but without any corresponding increase in gross profit.The problem that drove the shares down was investor dissatisfaction with guidance. I think to a degree, Wix sets guidance not overwhelmingly based on some internal forecast, but based on what prior expectations, at least in so far as they are published might have been. I am not inclined to think that guidance represents a real bottoms-up forecast, and in this case, that policy had a substantial impact on investor perceptions.The company is forecasting revenue growth of about 26% and free cash flow growth of about 35%, at the mid-point. That will take free cash flow margins to almost 18%. These results, if obtained, will propel the company into the “Rule of 40” club which suggests company’s who achieve a combination of percentage growth and free cash flow margins of greater than 40% are performing at a high level. Some analysts use the Rule of 40 in either screening or as an aid in decision making.The forecast resulted in a few positive earnings revisions, but the Raymond James analyst downgraded the shares. Earlier this week, the analyst at Guggenheim initiated coverage on the name at a buy.During the course of the conference call, Wix senior management observed that its forecast didn’t include revenue contribution from its newest products. I reaffirmed that in my conversation with Joe Pollaro and I think one needs to adjust revenue growth expectations accordingly. I am forecasting that revenue growth this year, which is forecast to be 26% by the company, will actually be 32% when including the contributions from Code and Ascend. The opportunities that are available to Wix in selling to agencies, and the aggressive spend going to that market suggest to me an expectation of noticeable success. And Ascend is one of those natural adjacencies-it almost is a question as to why a web site owner wouldn’t want Ascend as an add-on given the value of the information that the application collects to most businesses.Using revenues of $795 million as opposed to the consensus value of $760 million for the current year brings the EV/S calculation to less than 7X. That is one of the more attractive valuations for the growth cohort in the low thirty percent range. And 18% free cash flow margins, as projected, bring that metric to far above the average free cash flow margin for company’s in its growth cohort.Obviously basing valuation on a forecast that is not consistent with management guidance can be risky. And it can be difficult to forecast the revenue growth of newer products with minimal history. But I think it is inappropriate to reach an investment conclusion absent some kind of understanding that these products are potentially major contributors to revenues and profits. And Code has been available for more than a year now-I think it will have a meaningful impact with the agencies/studios that specialize in web site/web app developments.It has proven to be rare for companies to be able to produce decent profitability and cash flow generation while growing at or above 30%. That makes Wix particularly attractive as an investment. And I think the growth in gross margin percentages is as good an indicator as any that Wix is not seeing any profound pricing pressure or competitive inroads into its space. In these days, in which some analysts are willing to recommend unprofitable companies with EV/S of 25X in order to chase growth, it is refreshing to find a name with solid growth that is not valued at crazy levels. I think Wix could readily sustain much greater valuation if my growth expectations are fulfilled; and if not its valuation is at a level where risk is less than many other names. I think there is certainly the potential for significant positive alpha."

Not with Wix.Are bonds once again the smartest guy in the room? If so, expect an upside of another 50% in the stock price.However, the company finds it difficult to increase the number of its premium subscribers and takes an aggressive marketing policy that casts doubt on the company's business model.A dovish Fed can cause some FX headwinds for Wix's financial results.And yet, I would not dare initiate a short position against Wix.","Over the last 12 months, we have witnessed very high volatility in the markets. If we thought the markets were able to recover from the terrible month of December, the last month of May came with its trade wars (or vice versa), reminding us that just one tweet can knock down the leading indices by several hundred basis points.You would think the most volatile stocks during such periods would be small companies, say mid-cap and small-cap. Well, if you thought so, then you were right; ETF's like the Vanguard Mid-Cap Index Fund (VO) or the Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund (VB) have underperformed the S&P 500 (SPY) for almost the entire last 12 months. Is there any company that can withstand such turbulence in the markets? Apparently, there is - just take look at Wix (WIX), the Israeli cloud-based web development platform.As can be seen in the two monthly charts of December 2018 and May 2019, Wix has outperformed the market, and still, the market cap of the company does not exceed the $ 8 billion. In such a situation, it seems that even the shorts are starting to give up.On June 21, 2018, Wix announced the pricing of $443 million aggregate principal amount of 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023, in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers ($385 million + additional $58 million the purchasers have exercised to buy within 13 days). The Notes will mature on July 1, 2023, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. The conversion price was $ 142.63 per share. On the issuance date, the share price was $ 105.65, meaning that the embedded premium was 35%. A year has passed since then, and the share price is hovering the conversion price. Not bad at all, especially in such a volatile market.In order to effectively increase the conversion price, thereby reducing the dilution for Wix's existing shareholders, Wix carried out capped call deals with some of the offering purchasers that include a call option in effect raising the conversion price. The conversion price following the transactions has risen to $211.30, representing a 100% premium on the share price at the time of the offering, and a 50% premium on the current share price.This is what Wix's CFO, Lior Shemesh, had to say about that unique issuance:I admit that when the issue was first published, I did not understand why the purchasers have agreed to such a high conversion price (without any coupons), but right now, according to the latest sequence of events, it seems that they have made an excellent deal and it's better to buy Wix's shares and enjoy an upside of at least 50% from today's share price. And after all that, something still doesn't make sense to me with this company.Disclosure - I have a Wix website about Accounting Studies. I'm very pleased with the interface and think it's a fantastic product that allows quick and simple website designing, even if you don't understand the technical aspects of the process. I have built and designed the site in a plan that is often known as ""Freemium"", a portmanteau of ""Free"" and ""Premium"", meaning you get to build your site with many features, but you don't pay for it. However, users must purchase premium plans (subscriptions) in order to connect their sites to their own domains, remove Wix ads, add e-commerce capabilities and more. This is actually Wix's source of revenue; it offers several different plans at different prices, each with its unique features. According to Wix business plan, the company expects that the user will eventually upgrade his subscription to the premium one.However, over the past few years, Wix has faced a problem; the number of free subscribers (users like me) is growing, and so are the number of premium subscribers, but the ratio between the two is pretty much stagnant, around 3%, as you can see in the charts below.Source: Wix Interactive Analyst CenterAs I see it, this has led Wix to an aggressive marketing campaign in the past 12 months. How aggressive? Since June 2018, Wix has launched 42 times a 50% ""limited time only"" discount on most of its premium subscription plans, an average of 3.5 discounts per month, 7 of which were in December 2018 (since June 2018 I have kept all the emails I received from Wix regarding these promotions).Many companies use aggressive marketing campaigns in order to increase the number of premium users, that's fair, but it's hard to see how this strategy works for Wix, as the company continues to generate operating losses quarter after quarter.Wix is an Israeli company, but the company's operating currency is the US dollar. Over the past 18 months, the exchange rate between the dollar and the Israeli shekel has caused quite a few problems among Israeli high-tech companies operating abroad, including Wix. The Israeli shekel has strengthened significantly against the US dollar, and consequently, the company's expenses in dollar terms increased. In January 2018, Wix's president, Nir Zohar, called on the Bank of Israel (Israel's central bank) to intervene in the foreign currency market and buy dollars (in order to weaken the Israeli shekel):Fortunately for Wix, the Fed continued its hawkish policy until last December, while the Bank of Israel continued its dovish policy. This gap caused the Israeli shekel to weaken back to more reasonable levels for Wix. However, if the Fed responds to calls for a rate cut(s), it's reasonable to assume that the shekel will regain strength and will again overshadow Wix's financial results.US Dollar versus the Israeli Shekel:Source: The Federal Reserve and Yahoo Finance.If you had bought Wix shares in the last 12 months then you would have probably made an impressive return. Judging by the performance of the stock, especially in months like December 2018 and May 2019, it appears that this is a stock that can easily outperform the leading indices. Moreover, judging by the convertible notes issued by Wix in June 2018, the stock can also reach the exercise price of the capped calls - $ 211 per share. However, although the company continues to grow, the number of premium subscribers is still negligible relative to the company's overall subscriber base (circa 3%), despite its aggressive marketing campaign, which is clearly reflected in the company's recurring losses.As I see things right now, the company's strategy of generating profits is quite questionable, and in addition to all, if the Fed starts to cut rates, Wix's financial results will have to deal with some FX headwinds.Under such circumstances, you may want to take some profits off the table and wait for a correction. If we try to time when a correction in the share price is expected, perhaps we should look at the company's historical Price-to-Sales multiple. By looking at this multiple, it's possible that such a correction will occur soon.The source of the phrase ""Ifka Mistabra"" is in Aramaic, meaning ""On the Contrary."" As a person who lives in Israel, I can tell you that Wix is considered as one of the most innovative tech companies in Israel. Avishai Abrahami, the company's CEO, has often stated that the company has rejected offers for its acquisition. The company's market cap continues to grow but has not yet exceeded $ 8 billion, so it is still a fairly cheap takeover target for tech giants such as Google (GOOG) or Facebook (FB). Judging by the history of Israeli tech companies such as Mobileye (sold to Intel (INTL)) or Mellanox (sold to Nvidia (NVDA)), I would not be surprised if Wix breaks the Israeli 'Exit' record (now belongs to the $ 15 billion Mobileye deal), which is why I will never dare to open a short position against it.Thanks for reading!"

Most of that comes from its gradual move toward sustainable profitability, its AI and Wix app that locks in users to its platform, and the e-commerce trend that guarantees many more small businesses and organizations will keep demand for web development tools robust.It has maintained momentum after upwardly revising several of its important metrics in its latest earnings report.Wix is a platform that offers cloud-based web development tools for over 130 million users around the world, and domestically, it still has a lot of growth potential, as a high percentage of small businesses still don't have a website built.That last reporting period was a good one for Wix, as it reported revenue of $137.8 million, up 49 percent year over year, and a non-GAAP loss of 5 cents per share, which beat analysts' estimates by $0.05. That was in comparison to the 18 cents per share loss in the same reporting period of 2017.Collections in the quarter jumped to $159.7 million, up 39 percent.Free cash flow in the quarter was over $21.4 million, a record high for the company. That was upwardly revised from a range of $98 to $100 million, to $100-$102 million.It also broke a record for subscriptions in the first quarter, finishing with net premium subscription adds of 231,000, bringing its total to 3.5 million at the end of March 2018, up 29 percent. According to the company, for every 100,000 new subscriptions, it increases collections by about $165 million. Over the next eight years, it sees it generating over $370 million in collections at gross margins of 80 percent.For registered users, it added another 5.9 million to bring the total to 125 million at the end of March 2018, up 21 percent.It upwardly revised its revenue guidance from a range of $144-$145 million. For full-year fiscal 2018, it expects revenue to climb to a range of $594-$597 million, up from prior guidance of $591-$595 million. In 2017, revenue was up 46 percent, and had been guided to jump by 31 percent in 2018. I think that's going to be higher by the end of the year.Collections were upwardly revised from $645-$653 million to $651-$657 million. For full-year 2017, Wix had a loss of 1 cent per share, and is expected to generate a profit of 52 cents per share in 2018. That also will probably exceed expectations, but even if it doesn't, I think it's the beginning of sustainable profitability for the company.The trend for e-commerce growth isn't slowing down, as global sales are expected to reach about $4.05 trillion by 2020, according to eMarketer.In 2016, eMarketer projected 2017 e-commerce sales to climb to $2.352 trillion globally, and actual sales were $2.304 trillion. So it's highly likely its $4.05 trillion estimate will be in the ballpark. The 2017 global e-commerce sales brought market share to over 10 percent for the entire retail sector. If the $4.05 trillion estimate is close, it will account for about 14.6 percent of overall retail spending by 2020.Source: eMarketerWith its suite of improving tools, Wix is positioned well for consistent growth in the years ahead.In the U.S. alone, only about 55 percent of small businesses said they had a website. With the SBA saying the small business market represents about 28 million firms, it means approximately 12.5 million small businesses are without a website; many of them will without a doubt end up putting one up. Wix should get a decent portion of that business.The good news for Wix is there is growing demand for additional products and services that help further engage customers. With a subscription range of $5 to $25 a month, the company should not only convert more free users to paid subscribers, but also bump them up to plans with more features.Wix ADI is its Artificial Design Intelligence aid, which allows users to rapidly put a website up after answering a few questions. It generates a site based upon the users' answers, and then allows customization within the design.This provides a base to work from that allows users to have a foundation to work from rather than start from a blank page, which many find difficult to do. Rather than abandonment, small businesses complete the project.As for the Wix App, that is designed to allow users to build and manage content on their websites from a mobile device. It can be used with Android and iOS. This should be another long-term growth catalyst as the market quickly transitions from desktop to mobile and social channels for sales.Another powerful app Wix has worked on with Google is one that optimizes websites developed within the Wix ecosystem, which results in about 65 percent of users getting their pages listed on the first page of Google search results.With the need to have a web presence increasingly obvious, small businesses are starting to look for options to develop their own websites. Wix is positioned well to cater to that rising demand around the world.As shown earlier, even in the U.S., there are millions of businesses that don't have websites, and are certain to see the need to have one. Wix is one of, if not the best option out there for DIY websites.As of early 2017, Wix had over 305,000 e-commerce subscriptions, which accounted for about 15 percent of its overall subscription base. This is another reason it has so much potential to grow in the years ahead.Its future remains very bright, especially when considering it has little presence in the rapidly growing Asian market. If it can gain a hold there, it will surpass the expectations of probably everyone following the stock. But even without it, its presence in about 190 countries bodes well for growth going forward.It'll of course cost money to develop products and build out infrastructure in some of these markets, but overall, the company is positioned to enter into a consistent profitability stage that will overcome the costs associated with growth. Scale is a major part of the reason behind that. It has about 45,000 new users sign up every day.I like Wix because it is a brand leader in a trending market that will continue to grow for many years. It has the type of tools that people can use to build quality websites easily and effectively, and provides premium features for those that want more out of their sites.It does this all at a low cost while maintaining a strong balance sheet. With no long-term debt and $232.2 million in cash and short-term investments, along with solid cash flow, the company is able to fund new products and services.With its rapid pace of growth and improving earnings outlook, I think it has a lot of upward momentum left in it."
4182458,102683,2018-06-19T00:07:40-04:00,WIX is breaking out higher.The company is benefiting from the new digital trend.I am buying stock in this name.,"Wix.com (WIX) is seeing its share price breakout higher due to the continued success of its website-creating platform. In the current economic and social environment, it is important for all organizations to have an online presence. Wix allows users to simply and easily create a professional looking website. Demand for its services has been strong in the years since its IPO, leading to impressive revenue growth. Moreover, the company continues to reinvent in itself to stay ahead of competitors, leading to a per share loss for investors, but also continued innovation across the company. Investors have thus far been focused on top-line growth, pushing the company’s share price higher on record revenue results. I am buying stock in this company as its operational strength continues to fuel share price gains.Wix looks like an attractive opportunity at current levels as demand for its services continues to expand at an impressive pace due to the importance of all organizations having an online presence currently. Additionally, the company continues to reinvest back into the company to stay ahead of competitors.The company develops and markets an internet service that allows users to create Web content in Latin America, Europe, North America, Asia, and other countries. It offers Web development, design, and management solutions and apps through an online platform that enables its user base of businesses, organizations, professionals, and individuals to create a digital presence.Wix had a strong start to the year, beating expectations for both collection and revenues, leading to an increase in its full year outlook. The company reported record free cash flow of more than $21M, with operational success largely driven by strong conversion and retention in its cohorts. For example, Wix added 231,000 subscriptions in the most recent quarter, its most ever, according to its earnings call. The company has been monetizing this cohort over a long period of time without the need for additional marketing, aiding overall operating margins. This cohort also continues to expand in size, for every 100,000 new subscriptions, management estimates future collection of more than $186 million, with the cohort expected to generate over $370 million in collection over the next eight years at 80% gross margins with very little additional marketing. Due to the company’s strong product offering and word of mouth marketing, management has been able to commit little actual marketing dollars to expand its brand. This is a positive development for the company, and continues to be a function of its innovative platform, which does require constant reinvestment to stay ahead of its competitors.The company is also operating well on a product development front. Wix has expanded its new product offerings, while improving existing products. For example, management rolled out Wix Answers, which is a product developed in-house to support users. Other companies had asked if they could use Wix’s support infrastructure, leading to the creation of this service, which is receiving positive support so far, according to its earnings call.Wix Code is also growing in popularity. Developers and designers are using the many features of Wix Code in different ways to create advanced websites and applications, according to its earnings call. These features help create a strong community of users who are constantly incorporating their feedback as new features and functionality are released. The Wix Code platform currently has roughly 8x the users management originally expected to have at this state, signaling that a lot of their effort to bring in users is paying off, according to its earnings call.The creation of Wix Code and Wix Answers shows how management’s investment in the company can add users into its ecosystem. By allowing coders to create an even more custom product, it opens up its potential user base to more people. Additionally, Wix Answers allows users to feel more comfortable with its service, and become more functional on the platform as a result. All of this allows for customers to come into and stay in the ecosystem, paying recurring fees, while also paying up for additional services on the platform.Below is a chart of the company’s revenue and earnings per share. Over the last five years, the company has experienced strong growth due to the importance of all types of organizations having an online presence. Its revenue has risen from under $100M, to now roughly $500M, a testament to overall demand for the company’s service offering. Due to its constant reinvestment however, management has been unable to convert its strong demand into a per share profit. Investors do not look to be worried as of yet however, as its share price continues higher on stronger top-line growth results.Wix’s share price continues to trend strongly higher as investors are rewarding the company for impressive top-line growth. From mid-2017 through a few weeks ago, the company’s share price consolidated after running strongly higher. This consolidation gave way to a breakout higher following further strong operational results. The roughly 1 year consolidation was between $50-75. As investors pushed the company’s share price above $75 for the first time ever a few weeks back, this was deemed significant as the level had acted as strong resistance. Upward momentum should continue for Wix as continued top-line success should boost investor sentiment.Wix is seeing its share price breakout higher due to the continued success of its website-creating platform.

4186040,104556,2018-07-09T07:45:19-04:00,"Wix, the king of websites, looks like a compelling investment.The company has ramped up marketing spend to increase brand awareness and drive subscriptions.A combination of a solid business mode, careful analytics and great financials make this an interesting company to keep an eye on.","Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX), the popular website building platform, is winning in a crowded marketplace. A combination of a solid business mode, careful analytics and great financials make this an interesting company to keep an eye on.Wix makes money by selling subscriptions to its website building platform. These subscriptions range in price and functionality. For instance, an e-commerce plan will set you back $20 a month but a Combo plan, without selling capabilities costs $14.50. And of course, the plans are discounted for longer subscription periods.But Wix also offers a freemium model to allow people to tinker with the platform and eventual subscribe to it. At the latest count, the amount of total registered users was 125 million, up 22% from 103 million a year ago. In comparison, the number of premium subscribers is only a fraction of the total, at 3.5 million, up 48% from 2.7 million a year ago. What this tell us is that Wix is doing a good job of signing on subscribers as a portion of registered freemium users. Of course, this is the key driver for the business.What’s more is that Wix’s ecosystem is very strong. I can attest. I recently built a site (link in bio) using Wix and I was impressed. Without any coding knowledge, I created a halfway decent site. And there are all sorts of upsell opportunities. From creating a Gmail account for your business, to buying apps from the App Market, to purchasing more automated emails, to upgrade your account storage, the list is practically endless. This has created a sticky platform that is hard for users to back out of once they are too far in. Plus, once you know how to use the Wix system well, switching to another site for a $2/month discount, doesn’t sound too attractive.Wix also does a great job at keeping track of important metrics. In the past quarter, 231,000 subscribers were added, by far the most in a Q1 ever. The company estimates, from its data collection, that for every 100,000 subscribers, Wix will bring in $165 million in collections after 8 years at an 80% gross margin. So just in this past quarter, the company will most likely haul in $380 million in collections over the next 8 years.To put that in perspective, collections in the latest quarter were about $160 million. And once users are in the ecosystem, the data shows they spend much more over time.Source: Investor PresentationThe chart above shows, on average, how much Wix receives in collections over time from specific customer cohorts. So after 4 years, customers who signed on in the first quarter of 2014, have spent 4.6 the amount that Wix spent in customer acquisition. This is the reason the company has been so deliberate regarding the amount of marketing spend. You may have seen an ad by Wix on YouTube or another online outlet as it really is focusing on customer acquisition in this growth phase. And for good reason.Source: Investor PresentationAbove you can see that the company is spending heavily on marketing but if the customer lifetime value is much higher than customer acquisition cost, you like to see an emphasis on marketing. However, the company is not throwing money away. Management also likes to have cash-on-cash returns on investment in 7-9 months. If you read a Wix earnings call transcript, you will see an acronym “TROI” which stands for Time Return on Investment. Rather than just hoping that their marketing spend pays off, management is very intentional about how and when they get their money back.This emphasis on marketing spend has created valuable mindshare as well.Source: Investor PresentationThis is key as people usually don't switch providers after finding one they like.The solid business model and careful analytics collected by management have put Wix in an enviable financial position. In the last quarter, revenue shot up 49%, or 15% sequentially. Gross margins went from 84% a year ago to 80% this year but management made sure to point out that the reason for this was an accounting change from a new relationship with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Wix, in February, started realizing revenue from selling G suite subscriptions but it also affected the cost of revenues. Therefore, this shouldn’t be too much of a worry.One thing that really stood out was Wix’s ability to create free cash flow. Free cash flow grew 46% year over year to $21.4 million in the last quarter, or 16% of revenue. Management is modeling long-term free cash flow margins to hit 30% in the non-too-distant future. Also, on a non-GAAP basis, the company is right on the edge of consistently posting an operating profit. In the past three years in the first quarter, the operating margin has gone from -20% to -8% and now -1%. Clearly, there is some operating leverage built into the model.A combination of fantastic revenue growth, operating leverage, strong free cash flow and very respectable gross margins, show that Wix’s business is right on track.Moving onto valuation, even if the financials are fantastic, you still have to pay a reasonable price as an investor. As of writing this, Wix’s market cap has eclipsed $4.9 billion. Backing out the $265 million in cash on the balance sheet, enterprise value is about $4.6 billion. Based on the midpoint of this year’s sales guidance, which is $595.5 million, the company should easily hit the $600 million mark. This means the company is trading at less than 8x forward sales. For nearly 50% revenue growth and solid free cash flow margins, this valuation seems rather digestible.But why is the company not trading for a higher valuation relative to peers like Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Square (NYSE:SQ)?There are probably a variety of reasons but one might be that only 2.8% (3.5 million premium / 125 million users) of the user base are paying customers. It could show that Wix’s premium platform is really not solving a big problem. In short, the free version is good enough. From my vantage point, that line of thinking is a mistake. I see it as more opportunity for users to start premium subscriptions, especially coming off the strongest first quarter premium cohort ever. Plus, Wix Code, a new tool to service more advanced developers that was somewhat recently created, opens up Wix’s market considerably.Another risk is competition. The space seems crowded with the likes of Weebly, Square’s recent acquisition, WordPress, and SquareSpace. There are a lot of website builders out there so pricing power can become diminished. When asked his thoughts about Wix is taking market share in this space, the CEO said:From a high level, it is hard to understand the competitive advantages in this space. Essentially, the question, why Wix over someone else? Better technology, easier to use, more innovation, what is it? In my eyes, it’s simple, Wix offers the best value out there. I did rigorous research to choose a website building platform and I came upon Wix and based on the price for the ease of use, it seemed like a no-brainer. And I’ve been very happy with the choice. From an investor’s point of view, the numbers seem to back that up as well.Wix plays in a crowded space but the company seems to offer more value than other providers. This has been sustained by a solid business model and careful analytics resulting in great financials.Keep this one in mind. Wix looks to be creating a very sticky tool to help people build stunning websites.Author’s Note: Hit the big, orange ""Follow"" button and toggle on the real-time updates box to get these articles before they hit the paywall.

This is likely a result of strong sales growth, proving the company’s business concept is sound. Even though the company has struggled so far to translate this success into its bottom line, financial statement analysis suggests Wix is likely to break-even as soon as it manages to take control over its costs of goods sold.Wix.com is a web development platform facilitating businesses to create and run online presentations and various tools such as reservation and scheduling apps, online stores and other. The company has currently a little over 2000 employees in offices all over the world such as Tel-Aviv, San Francisco, Miami, New York, Los Angeles, Vancouver, Kiev, Vilnius or Berlin. The majority of the company’s revenue (~83 percent) comes from one year+ subscriptions services such as web hosting and domain parking, whilst the rest comes from short term deals which represent around a third of the volume of all new subscriptions. Over the last 8 years, the company’s revenue base has become substantially more diversified, with a greater proportion of revenues coming from Asia, Latin America and Europe.Source: Wix.com 2018 Q4 earnings presentationReading through the quarterly earnings call, the company’s management reiterated the company's vision to 'enable everyone to create their dreams online' and provided revenue guidance of 25-26 percent for the next year. Besides this qualitative outlook, the management also discussed its strategy for the upcoming quarters which was indicated to evolve primarily around entering new markets and expanding its current product offerings (with possible removal of the lowest-priced packages). In the past quarter, the company benefited primarily from churn minimizing efforts, investing in the 'go to market' segment and increasing demand from web agencies.A closer look at the company’s financials reveals that the company has already managed to proof its business concept and is likely soon to prove its competence. Despite negative operating earnings this year, Wix’s EBIT Margin has been gradually improving. As the company’s SG&A expenses as a percentage of annual revenues have been on a decline, it seems the best possible way to break-even will be through taking control over the COGS (or cost of revenues), which according to Wix's latest 2018 10-K report, include items such as bandwidth, hosting, customer support software solutions and call center costs, along with domain name registration costs, share-based compensation, personnel and other related overhead costs.In the light of revenue variation of popular Peter Lynch's earnings line for the projection of probable per share values of the company, I estimate Wix's shares to offer a positive return potential (with an expected 3-4 year annualized rate of return potential between -11 and +40 percent). According to my model assuming 40 percent annual revenue growth decreasing by 5 percent each year, 49.9 million shares outstanding diluting at 5.9 percent annual rate and an average price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6x, the company's share price by the end of 2022 could hover around $178 USD.Source: Author's own Excel modelTo sum up, Wix is a fast-growing innovative web development company, facilitating cost-efficient and accelerated website creation. The company has a healthy focus on growing the first line of its income statement and has been successfully mitigating its losses on the bottom line. At the current pace of improvement, I believe the company is just steps from turning fully into black figures which can help to sustain the stock’s long run momentum."

Click here to find out more »I was recently asked by a client to help him choose an on-line e-commerce store front for his business. While doing so, I looked at two alternatives: Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and WiX (NASDAQ:WIX). This prompted me to look at both companies from both a financial and a product perspective and share my findings.Following is the stock graph for both companies:The correlation between both companies is very high and both have experienced a huge return on investment (383% for Shopify and 225% for WiX) in less than 3 years. Both companies operate in the same field (providers of e-commerce and web sites). In addition, both companies have comparable revenue (in the range of $500M each) and comparable number of employees (approximately 2,000 for Shopify and 2,400 for WiX).Shopify is an e-commerce platform, while WiX is a general web site building platform with e-commerce capabilities. WiX has come a long way over the past 12 months to the extent that it is now competing head-to-head with Shopify in the e-commerce software space, and is now considered the primary Shopify competitor. If this trend continues for the next 12 months, WiX will surpass Shopify from a functionality perspective, and this will result in significantly curtailing the potential growth rate for Shopify.Shopify and WiX have an overlap in terms of their target market. The following diagram shows how the customer base of both companies overlap:At a high level, if someone has a few products they are selling (like authors or sports clubs), they should use WiX. If someone is in the e-commerce business with hundreds of products, then Shopify would be a better choice.The following table provides a comparison between both products from a product perspective and the winner in each category:This section provides the detailed comparison of the above features. You might like to skip the details and jump directly to the BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL COMPARISON REVIEW BELOW.Given that most of the e-commerce clients for both companies are using the starting package, we will look at the starter package for both.WiX is conspicuously less expensive than Shopify. WiX starts at $17 per month while Shopify starts at $29. The features provided are very similar and comparable for simple e-commerce stores. For more details about the features, all you need to do is to search for ""WiX vs Shopify"" on YouTube, and you would get many videos that compare both platforms.Please note the date of the video you are watching. Many videos are outdated from 2016 and 2017. WiX has improved quite significantly over the last 12 months, and you should review the videos from 2018.In general, at the low end, both products provide very similar features. However, as the e-commerce needs increase, the Shopify features become better than the WiX features.While these videos are useful, you should take them with a grain of salt. WiX does not pay for referring clients to them, Shopify has an Affiliate Program that pays up to $2,000 for each merchant referral. In some comparison videos, you will find the presenter asking the viewer to click on a Shopify link for them to ""take credit and continue creating free comparison videos"".Both products are very easy to set up.WiX, being a general website builder platform, has more templates for different types of businesses, and you can add an on-line store for any of these templates as a separate page. WiX also has the WiX Artificial Design Intelligence in addition to its regular editor which can have the e-commerce site up and running in a very short time frame.Shopify, being specialized in e-commerce excels in the maintenance of the site after is being built. It also has a very large number of templates related to e-commerce sites. Shopify compares negatively against WiX from the perspective of enhancing the site with features that are not related to e-commerce, for example, blogs, resources, surveys, on-line bookings, memberships, calendars, and general forms.On the other hand, Shopify provides the ability for users to switch themes after the site is built, which is not yet available via WiX.In July 2017, WiX introduced WiX Code, the new feature that allows the site developers with an unlimited ability to introduce new features and have native database access to their site. More details are available in their public announcement: Wix Introduces Wix Code.I personally believe that WiX Code is an integral feature of WiX's strategy that would allow developers to create more advanced features which will eventually enhance the experience of WiX users.Shopify does not provide this level of flexibility in its site and its development standards are more rigid.Shopify has support for all subscription plans, while WiX has phone support only for the upper tier (which is still less expensive than Shopify). In addition, Shopify provides help with non-technical issues like how to sell your products. On the other hand WiX provides Professional Site Review with its upper tier plan ($25 per month, which is still less expensive than Shopify's starter plan at $29 per month).Both companies provide a comprehensive support database and a user group community that can help answering in-depth questions.CORRECTION: After publishing the report, WiX PR staff contacted me and informed me that while WiX does not provide a traditional call centre, they provide a call-back feature for all its users, even the free ones. According to WiX, this functionality is the same as calling and provides less sitting and waiting.In general, Shopify has better customer support compared to WiX.In this category, Shopify wins without competition. They allow integration with other platforms like Amazon, Facebook, Messenger and many other platforms. WiX does not have these capabilities, and Shopify clearly wins on this front.The following table provides a comparison between both companies from a financial perspectiveThe financial details are based on the latest annual financial results from both Shopify (Shopify Announces Fourth-Quarter and Full Year 2017 Financial Results) and WiX (Wix Reports Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2017 Results). All figures are in USD.Annual revenue for Shopify was $673M and for WiX was $425M. However these numbers do not tell the whole story:As a result of the above adjustments, on a non-GAAP basis, the revenue can be adjusted for both companies, and it would result in over $525M of revenue for WiX and lower than $450M for Shopify.Both companies have expenses in the low $400M ($429M for Shopify and $406M for WiX). If we look at the details of these expenses, we will see that the breakdown of expenses is marginally different:Looking at the trends, Shopify expenses went up by 75% year-over-year with most of the increase in the Sales and Marketing, while WiX expenses have gone up by 40%.I would personally see the expense profile marginally better for WiX which spends more on R&D compared to Shopify. The significant increase in the Sales and Marketing expenses for Shopify (about $100M increase) also worries me about their sales and marketing strategies.As of the end of the year, Shopify had $1,025M in current assets, while WiX had $264M. The more important factor is cash from operations. Shopify generated $8M from operating activities while WiX generated $83M from operating activities, more than 10 times as much. Moreover, the cash flow from operating activities from Shopify dropped by about 40% from $14M to $8M while WiX's cash flow from operating activities more than doubled from $40M to $83M.The above numbers provide a relatively gloomy picture for Shopify's cash flow from operating activities compared to WiX.Both companies are in a losing position, so the PE ration is not meaningful. However, price to revenue may provide a more meaningful measure for comparison.As of March 3rd, the market cap of Shopify was $11.95B compared to a market cap of $3.49B for WiX. That is, WiX is valued as a company at 30% of the value attributed to Shopify.On a non-adjusted GAAP basis, Shopify's revenue was $673M and WiX's revenue was $425M. This means that Shopify is trading at 17.8 times the historical GAAP revenue while WiX is trading at 8.2 times the historical GAAP revenue.Based on the adjusted financial statements, Shopify's revenue is approximately $450M and WiX's revenue is $600M. This would increase the price for Shopify to be 26.6 times the historical non-GAAP revenue and reduce the price for WiX to be 6.6 times the historical non-GAAP revenue.In other words, based on the adjusted historical financial statements, Shopify is about 4 times as expensive as WiX.The numbers do not lie, and based on historical figures, Shopify has experienced a higher growth rate compared to WiX both from revenue and number of customers perspectives.The following chart shows the GAAP revenue growth rate for Shopify (in millions of USD):This is an impressive chart and shows that, while both companies are experiencing a good growth rate, Shopify's revenue has been growing significantly faster than WiX.The next chart shows the paying subscriber[1] base growth rate:While WiX has a significantly higher number of paying customers, most of these customers are at much lower subscription base compared to Shopify. This shows that the per-user annual fee for WiX is significantly lower than that of Shopify, and accordingly they would be less price-sensitive and more committed to the WiX platform.In general Shopify beats WiX on all fronts of historical growth.While history may provide a glimpse on what the future is holding for us, this is not necessarily the case for the comparison between Shopify and WiX. Management guidance may also provide some indication, but in this fast changing environment, we cannot rely on them.Because of the continued growth of e-commerce, I expect both companies to continue growing. However, I expect the WiX growth rate to be increasing while the Shopify growth rate will be stagnant or even decline. Here are the reasons for my prediction:I would recommend longing WiX and shorting Shopify for the following reasons:[1] WiX has over 119,000,000 overall registered users, most of which are non-paying (only 3,200,000 are paying), which provides a tremendous growth opportunity for WiX."
4146648,104119,2018-02-14T14:17:37-05:00,"Wix.com is a dilutive company that's been unable to translate ~564% of sales growth into equally impressive bottom line growth, with a negative earnings yield.Troublesomely, its net income is no higher than it was back in 2013.Even granting the most charitable revenue growth assumptions imaginable, investors should still be wary, due to Wix.com's dilutive history.","Wix.com (WIX) is a web development platform provider. As Joe Pollaro states at a recent conference regarding WIX:Sounds so good one might wonder why it's struggling to generate consistent profits. But, first things first. Let's talk about dilution.As many of you know, one of the first things I look at when I analyze a company is its recent history of share dilution. As we know, when a company issues additional shares, an investor's share of ownership decreases. Research suggests that even acquisitions funded with stock are not generally favorable for investors, as they fare worse than those funded with cash:As we can see from the chart below that, Wix.com has diluted its shareholders by about 262% since its IPO.WIX Average Diluted Shares Outstanding (Annual) data by YChartsTo explore just how extraordinary this cost is for shareholders of WIX, let's start with a thought experiment. Let's say you buy 1,000 shares of WIX today at ~$63.20 when it has ~44.8M shares outstanding.Source: Author's WorkLet's say, over the next five years or so, WIX achieves the unbelievably challenging feat of doubling its revenue. (Impressive, in a growing, competitive market!) And, let's say that, because investors love to reward revenue, the stock price reflects that. Your risk has paid off!But let's say that, ceteris paribus, during that time, WIX has also diluted the shareholder base by about 262% (as per its history charted above). So now, just a few years later, there would be ~162M shares outstanding.Source: Author's WorkHolding all else constant, in our little scenario, the company doubled its revenue and simultaneously diluted its shareholder base. That means that revenue per share has actually decreased, from about $8.73 to $4.82. That means that, instead of your shares being worth $17.46 per share, they would now be worth only $4.82 per share - simply because of the dilution.Instead of your original $63K investment growing to a little over $126K, even though you made the correct directional call, now, simply because of management's decision to dilute those shares, your investment is worth significantly less.Dilution is just one of the many risks that investors may face, among risks like business risk, market risk, opportunity risk, inflationary risk, legislative risk. No matter how bullish you are regarding WIX's growth prospects, you should still be wary of its plans with regards to dilution. Growing revenue won't guarantee price-based returns because we're rewarded on a per share basis. If it continues to dilute its shareholder base, your profits may not grow in line with its revenue growth.With WIX's share price up over 200% since 2015, trading at 647x book value while generating a negative (-1.95% TTM) earnings yield, there may be some optimism embedded in its price. This optimism may not be good for investors. As the Review of Accounting Studies suggests (emphasis added):Before its most recent earnings report with EPS in-line, Wix.com provided several earnings disappointments in a row.Consider the chart below. Consider Wix.com's stellar revenue growth. Revenue can't grow at such high rates forever; growth can stall for even the best companies. If its current revenue increases haven't yet led to earnings growth, what will it take?WIX Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsIn fact, after running a correlation analysis, we can see that, quarterly, its earnings and net income were negatively correlated to a tune of -0.08. And - troublesomely - its net income is no higher than it was back in 2013. Investors, in my opinion, shouldn't overpay for such lackluster earnings.The point is this. Even granting the most charitable revenue growth assumptions imaginable, investors should still be wary, due to WIX's dilutive history. Even assuming five years of amazing price-linked revenue growth, an investor's reward may very well be muted if it continues diluting its shareholder base. The dilutive situation discussed above is even worse when we consider its struggle to turn sales growth into earnings growth. As such, I caution investors against buying shares of WIX and recommend they look for better risk-adjusted returns elsewhere."
4115242,98236,2017-10-21T11:06:17-04:00,"Wix shares have languished for some 7 months now, and have thus become more attractive both on an absolute and relative basis.The company continues to build on its leadership position in terms of website building expertise.The company has dramatically improved its performance in the website optimization space, a key user consideration.The company has recently introduced Code, a product that can readily double the TAM for this company and sustain hyper-growth for several more years.The company's relatively conservative guidance has provided investors with favorable risk/reward parameters prior to the announcement of quarterly earnings early next month.","One of the investment themes that has worked well so far in 2017 is finding those enterprises that offer users development platforms and tools that have helped customers create and enhance their websites. Obviously, a prime beneficiary of that trend has been Shopify (SHOP), but in addition to that vendor, much of the success that Square (SQ) and Adobe (ADBE) have achieved in these last few quarters relate to users trying to enhance the web experience of their own customers and potential customers. Wix (WIX) is another company that essentially is in the same space.The title of the introduction comes from a famous song of the late 1920’s, Puttin’ on the Ritz, composed by Irving Berlin and most famously performed by Fred Astaire. The title derives from a slang expression of the era which meant to dress fashionably. And of course, Wix is a platform that allows users to dress their websites fashionably - indeed, the company talks about its ability to create the most beautiful of websites. (Just to be clear, the original lyrics and the contemporary equivalent of music videos of that era had some typical racial innuendos. The composer later altered the lyrics to avoid any racial connotations. I hope that readers simply accept the title for what it is meant to convey - there is no political message intended.)The company is hardly undiscovered (it is covered by 14 analysts who are post their recommendations on First Call, and of that cohort, it is rated a buy by 8) and the shares are not particularly cheap - although no longer an outlier in terms of valuation either. The company currently has a market capitalization of $3.1 billion and an enterprise value of just less than $3 billion. That calculates to an EV/S on the forward 12-month revenue consensus of just above 6X.As will be explored in some detail through this article, the consensus revenues and growth rate for 2018 strike this writer as unrealistically low. Most publishing analysts are projecting EPS for 2018 in the range of $1.25+ non-GAAP, although the consensus that appears in First Call is quite a bit lower. At the $1.25 EPS level, the company has a P/E of 55X, quite a bit less than most hyper-growth vendors.Wix has forecast that it will generate free cash flow of about $67-$68 million this year. Given the sharp increase anticipated in operating earnings next year, and continued growth in deferred revenues, it seems likely that cash flow from operations could reach $150-$160 million of revenues in 2018 with free cash flow reaching as much as $140 million. Most of the company’s operating cash flow currently comes from the increase in deferred revenue balances, although stock-based comp will still wind up being around 35% of free cash flow using trending projections. I think a free cash flow yield projected at over 4.6% is a rather impressive metric, and is both a testament to the strength of a subscription-based business model with moderate churn and to a steadily improving ARPU metric that ultimately drives profitability. After 7 months in share price purgatory, during which many of its peers were showing almost extravagant share price appreciation, Wix shares have become far more of a relative bargain than they have been in some time. At this point, the valuation no longer seems extreme and yet the company has continued its hyper-growth trajectory.The shares took a noticeable tumble in the wake of the last earnings report, apparently because the company chose not to raise guidance at that point, despite a quarter that was significantly better than expected. I think it is time for investors to take another look at this company in front of the 3rd quarter earnings release, scheduled for November 8th. The set-up is reasonable and the share price has relatively compressed noticeably. Given the overall trends in the space and for IT spending as a whole, I think the shares are worth buying at current levels.There are many companies which have a variety of motivations when they give guidance. And, of course, analysts parse guidance as though they contain nuggets of wisdom. I initially wrote about this company back in May. I was a bit afraid of its valuation and its strong recent share price performance at that time. High valuations can readily lead to investor concern about what might otherwise be construed as an innocent statement. In fact, it is probably worth looking at part of the conference call transcript at that time to put that issue to rest. “This is Lior (company CFO). So, with regards to the question, absolutely not. I mean we don’t see any deacceleration in our business. Actually, it’s quite the opposite. Let’s remember that with Q3 guidance and for the overall year, we’re actually confirming the annual guidance that we provided back in May which basically indicates a 39% increase of growth on a year over year basis, which we think is incredible. And we feel very comfortable with that, that this is exactly according to our expectations, again, from the beginning of the year…” I can't purport to understand the interstices of the guidance provided at the end of July. But the sharp sell-off of the shares back then, almost entirely because of management's choice not to increase guidance seems to this writer to be at significant variance with what the guidance was actually meant to imply.Wix results have exceeded guidance thus far this year on the revenue line. Revenue growth has shown a noticeable reacceleration. The company has made a significant tuck-in acquisition and has announced a new set of capabilities which should expand the TAM and should have further salutary impacts on percentage growth. I expect that at the least, revenue over attainment will continue to be a consistent theme this quarter and for the next several quarters as well. I think the issue of possibly declining percentage growth is basically contrived and not supported by the preponderance of the evidence.WIX is a platform on which users and developers can develop websites. It is based on a so-called “freemium” model and most of its 110 million users are part of the free community. It is fair to ask what makes Wix unique in a field in which users have dozens of choices in terms of finding tools to build and host their website. One element in the company’s success is that it has been willing to spend to make itself known. Does spending money on Super Bowl ads featuring well-known actors constitute a defensible moat? Of course, it wouldn’t be the case if this were enterprise software - but Wix is not quite an enterprise software vendor.I have linked to a third-party source called Website Tool Tester to try to provide readers with something close to an unbiased evaluation of what makes Wix win. For those who don’t want to read the commentary, it basically calls out the fact that on balance, using Wix is likely to get users “better” websites that will wind up being more attractive and which are, on balance, likely to outperform websites built with other tools. It is the templates that the company offers that set it apart. In addition, the tools are called extremely flexible, it offers animations, it has built a large 3rd party community that offers many features and it has some level of artificial intelligence that is used to help its users build their sites. The company was early in terms of developing technology that allows users to build their sites to run on mobile devices.The evaluation raises some quibbles. Building a website on a mobile device using Wix requires some manual intervention. It is said to be a bit more complicated to use for beginners than the tools offered by major competitor Weeby. And the Wix e-commerce product is for smaller merchants and is significantly outclassed by Shopify in terms of feature/function. If a user is trying to build a major e-commerce presence, it is fair to say that Wix is not best solution.It is probably fair to say that Wix is ahead of the curve at this writing. But part of building a defensible moat really does require a very rapid pace of technology innovation. I do not propose to write about all of the new functionality that Wix has added in the past year. I will comment about Wix Code later in this article because it is said to be a TAM expanding innovation that is a bit unique. Wix ADI is also likely to be viewed as somewhat unique. Perhaps of most importance is the number of new verticals that the company launched and will continue to launch including templates for bookings sites, music sites, restaurants and many additional verticals. Verticalization is a hoary software strategy - because it works well and since the days of SAP R3 it has proven to be one of the most effective differentiators that vendors can implement.Most recently, investors have been concerned about potential competition with GoDaddy (GDDY), a company best known for registering domain names. I have linked here to a competitive evaluation between Wix and GoDaddy provided by a site called HostAdvice. Suffice it to say that based on this review, neither Wix or its shareholders has much to worry about from competition from GDDY. Simply put, “Wix has a more reliable environment, better pricing, more features and superior customer support. Users of each company rank Wix better as well. When our hosting experts reviewed all the factors, we are confident in naming Wix as the winner in this comparison.”The most significant competitor to Wix is a company called Weebly. (I have no idea as to how these companies have chosen to name themselves. Being historically minded, Weebly reminds me of most of what were called the Wobblies, an anarchist trade union, the IWW that “flourished” mainly in the Pacific Northwest a century ago. But I am quite sure that the founders of Weebly had no intention of emphasizing that association.)I have linked to a comparison from Website Builder Expert that evaluates the two competitors. While in this evaluation, there is no absolute clear winner, I think the preponderance of the evidence suggests that Wix has the most advanced technology and is certainly said to have the better selection of templates. If a user has some level of sophistication, and wants to build a feature rich website, than according to this expert, Wix is the clear choice.At the end of the day, this is an article about the virtues, and deficiencies of Wix as an investment. I think that from what can be adduced by looking at 3rd party evaluations, Wix is the current leader in its space, it has better products, more name recognition and is likely to remain the category leader for the foreseeable future. As is often the case in looking at companies in what are still nascent categories, Wix’s challenges as an investment will be those of sales execution and expense management and not competition.Most analysts evaluating Wix look carefully at user growth both on an annual basis and a sequential basis. They then look at revenue growth which is driven by both the increase in users and the ARPU (Average Revenue per User). This past quarter, premium users - the kind that actually pay money to use the Wix service grew by 7.2% sequentially and are now 35% above year earlier levels. In Q2 of the prior year, sequential growth in subscriptions was 9.4% while the number of users grew by 41% year on year.What is particularly interesting to this writer is that while 41% user growth grew revenues by 42% in the year earlier quarter, 35% user growth grew revenues by a bit more than 50% last quarter. It is this kind of leverage that is likely to produce significant profitability and sticky customer relationships going forward.As it happens, ARPU did not increase in Q2. Management called out some promotional activity, i.e., special price offers because of Easter, but the CEO went on to forecast that the metric would continue to climb. It is very easy to over analyze every metric for a company like this and lose sight of the forest. Last year, the company introduced several verticals as mentioned earlier in this article. The verticals were more successful than were initially forecast with about 30% of users choosing the verticalized product compared to an initial estimate of 15%. So, in fact, the ARPU was already above company expectations in Q1 which, in turn, led to a flattish sequential trend in Q2.At this point, Wix is the largest vendor in the website building market with the largest number of currently operating websites. That is nice to write, but not terribly important to investors. What is really important is the conversion rate from using a free tool to becoming a paying customer. At the end of the day, companies can advertise all they want, but getting a free user to spend money is a function of that user getting value from what Wix sells. When revenue growth is built on user benefits, and there is some substantiation in terms of seeing growth accelerate from already elevated levels, it speaks volumes more than my poor keyboard in suggesting that the Wix growth phenomenon is likely to be real and sustainable.Most recently, Wix introduced a product it calls Code. I don’t propose to write a review of the product and I really do not have the skills to do so effectively. What I can say, without fear of much contradiction is that the new product allows users to add advanced functionality to their website relatively painlessly. It would seem to answer the few quibbles that the reviewers linked above had suggested.Code is designed to address the 95% of potential website operators who will choose to use professionals to build their website. As such, it has been forecast by the company and other observers, to double the available TAM and has the potential to sustain the company’s hyper-growth for some years into the future. At this point, it has only been available for a couple of months. I assume that more will be said about its revenue generation potential during the earnings call. For what it is worth, the CEO said on the latest call that he expected that by 2019, Wix Code will actually be bigger than other platform for web development. Needless to say, if it works that way, then current growth assumptions for the company, which show growth falling to 32% next year, compared to estimates for top line growth of 46% this year, will have to be dramatically revised. Code has been extensively beta tested with favorable response on the part of its users. It appears to fill a significant market need. Management's commentary is bold and positive and perhaps more so in that regard than might have been expected. The success of Code is a principle factor in a positive investment evaluation for this company.Search Engine Optimization is a topic that is often written about. Users create a website with the expectation that it will be visited. A critical element of the business model for a company like Wix is that it is able to deliver strong performance in terms of SEO. For some period, Wix had a poor reputation in terms of what it could actually accomplish in terms of helping its users get their websites viewed. These days, there is a review for almost everything, and there is actually an article, linked here, that talks specifically about how Wix has transformed its SEO technology so that it is now a leader in that area.Is that a reason for the company’s growth reacceleration? It is hard to say, given the paucity of specific evidence. I think that it is likely that there has been some correlation between more rapid growth seen the past two quarters and the company’s improved SEO capabilities. If one is looking for a secret sauce in terms of improving rates of conversion from free to paid and in terms of rising revenue per paid subscriber, improving the performance of SEO is probably as good a place as any to start.The company recently acquired a business called DeviantArt. It is another one of those strange names, although perhaps it appeals to younger, more creative users. DeviantArt was not acquired to inflect short-term financial results. It will add something less than 2% to Wix revenues this year and it will diminish cash flow by something more than 10%. What it is supposed to accomplish will be to expose more young and “cool” developers to the Wix platform and when it is fully integrated it will increase the range of visual alternatives that Wix will be able to offer its community. Sometimes, in looking at things like this, I feel more than a bit of empathy for Theodore Roosevelt after he saw the Armory Show in 1913 - but acquiring DeviantArt is likely to be part of an effective strategy in build a competitive moat for Wix that should not be under-appreciated. I confess that I find some of the ""art"" to be appalling and much of it to be quite disturbing-but then I am not the kind of potential customer for which Wix is aiming.As mentioned earlier in this article, many analysts rate Wix shares a hold based on valuation. They love it, but they just do not find the valuation compelling. In some ways, I think it is that kind of controversy that makes the case for buying this name a bit more compelling. Many analysts are not persuaded that hyper-growth can continue, and because of that, they have developed quite conservative valuation parameters.In the wake of the Q2 earnings release and conference call, the almost universal theme, both from positive and negative analysts had to do with guidance. Wix shares fell by 26% in the wake of the guidance provided on that call, before recovering about 65% of that loss over the subsequent two months.I tried earlier in this article to suggest that guidance is not always what it seems, even when it seems straightforward enough. I do not think I need to return to that theme. I have attempted to lay out a case here as to why Wix is likely to exceed current guidance and estimates and remain a hyper-growth story for years. In looking at valuation, investors more or less need to determine how they choose to invest in smaller, high-growth businesses. I think the odds of finding exactly the right entry point are low. That said, it strikes me that with a 7-month hiatus in share price appreciation, the shares, from a relative point of view are particularly attractive.Wix is making some progress in its path to profitability and expectations suggest that the cadence of the progress is likely to increase. At a headline level, the company reported non-GAAP break-even last quarter, in line with prior expectations, compared to a $.09 non-GAAP EPS loss the prior year.As is my practice, the foregoing analysis is all based on GAAP metrics. In Q2, operating expenses at Wix were 112.3% of revenues. This compares to 117.9% of revenues the prior year and to 126.1% of revenues the prior quarter. General and administrative costs showed some moderation sequentially, although they were up by 41% year on year.Gross margins were 82.6% of revenues last quarter compared to 83.9% of revenues in the quarter the prior year. To a limited extent, the improvement in results has been constrained by the losses being made by DeviantArt, although at this point, those expenses are baked into guidance.Consensus expectations for 2018 call for a significant improvement in key expense ratios. That said, this is a business model that will almost inevitably have higher than average research and development spending in an attempt to build a competitive moat.The competitive evaluations linked earlier in this article are the product of substantial investments in new product development which has to continue to foster hyper-growth. Sales and marketing cost may show better trends if the advent of the Code product results in significant sales at higher price points to enterprise users.Based on the company’s business model, in many ways, collections are probably a better metric in terms of analyzing sales progress than reported revenues. Most of the revenues Wix reports come from the balance sheet as it signs one year deals with most of its paying users that are then amortized into revenues. Collections increased by 44% last quarter compared to 51% in Q1 which normally shows the strongest relationship to revenues because of renewals. That relationship typically troughs in Q3-4 which are the lowest quarters for renewal revenues.The company uses a significant level of stock based comp which is not surprising given its very high research and development spend and the competitive necessity of incenting developers. Last quarter, stock based comp was $12 million or 11% of revenue. Stock-based comp was up by 82% year on year and by 33% sequentially. Without specific discussion by the company regarding their strategy for cost management, I don’t know at what point the stock based comp ratio peaks. That said, it appears as though the company will still make a small GAAP operating margin for the full year of 2018, again, better than many other comparable vendors in the small-cap tech space.All of that said, the reason to buy these shares at this point is simply one of expected growth at rates significantly above currently published expectations. This is a strong space - although there are no real statistics for what market growth really is. The TAM is large - there are research reports that cite TAM’s of $30 billion or more. The company has a strong competitive position and has recently introduced a solution that is thought to move Wix into a new and essentially virgin market space. While these shares certainly do not have a “deep value”, they have ceased to be outliers and yet the outlook for growth is perhaps stronger than it has been in some time. I think the potential for the shares to yield positive alpha is excellent."
4150311,98236,2018-02-23T17:40:00-05:00,"Wix reported the results of Q4 a bit more than a week ago.Results and guidance basically showed a reacceleration of revenue growth, but no real pivot to profitability.The company guidance typically excludes some elements of revenue that are likely to lead to over-attainment in the course of the year.A crucial element of the company's future performance will be the success of recently released Wix Code.The initial experience for Code has been better than company expectations. And if that trend continues, the company will noticeably exceed growth expectations in 2018 and for some time to come.","I confess to not being a TV viewer, and somehow I'm that rare soul who managed to go through Super Bowl Sunday without cheering on either the Eagles or the Patriots. As it happened, there was a pretty fair crowd of diners and wine drinkers looking to avoid the event by enjoying the cuisine at La Republique, the closest one can come to a French bistro experience in the LA basin.While I have followed Wix (WIX) for some time now, I confess that I was unaware that it sponsored something called ""Good Mythical Morning"" and that the stars of this show, which apparently has some measure of popularity, appeared in the 2018 Wix Super Bowl ad and also have endorsed the Wix service. I have never watched a show on YouTube, and somehow I don't imagine it is an experience for my bucket list.And now, having confessed to my lack of integration into the popular culture of the day, I will get back to the purpose of this article which is to assess the strong quarter that Wix reported last week. I first wrote about this company a few months ago and followed it up in October in the wake of the company's share price pullback. Back at that point, a few analysts such as the individual from Wedbush were bemoaning the company's extra development spending which caused it to miss Q3 EPS estimates. This time around, while reported non-GAAP EPS was just in line, revenue growth was above expectations, and revenue growth guidance for 2018 was well above prior estimates.The company's faster revenue growth forecast this year is partially a function of its deeper alliance with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Because of the enhanced relationship, Wix will now change its reporting of its sales of Google's G-Suite from that of recognizing net revenues as an agent to recognizing gross revenues as a principal. In addition, the adoption of ASC 606 is going to add marginally to growth in the current year.That said, as will be detailed later, the company actually saw an organic growth resurgence last quarter and is anticipating a further noticeable resurgence in growth this year as its guidance doesn't actually mean the same as guidance from many other companies. See Slide 18 of the Q4 investor presentation for details.This company focuses on free cash flow growth rather than non-GAAP profitability as its favored metric in terms of margins. That's probably because it has not optimized its operations at this point to produce any earnings at all. It is forecasting that it will achieve a free cash flow margin of about 15% on collections in 2018, up slightly from the 14.7% free cash flow margin the company reported last year. Growing free cash flow by over 40% year over year, after a year in which that metric grew by 85%, suggests that this come has a healthy business model even at its current scale.As for the title of this article, it comes from a song called ""They Say its Wonderful"" composed for the musical ""Annie Get Your Gun"" by Irving Berlin. The song was about how falling in love was wonderful. Many users seem to have fallen in love with the websites they have been able to build with Wix based on the commentary I have read in connection with preparing this article. It has continued to enjoy very high renewal rates and user satisfaction scores.While I rarely fall in love with my investments and eschew anthropomorphism, particularly when it comes to investing, I do believe that Wix, while not worth loving, is certainly worth an investment and for something a bit more long lasting than a fling.It should be noted at the outset that Wix, as a company, is focused more on operating cash flow/free cash flow and therefore collections - or bookings really, than it is on the more traditional financial metrics. Collections, or what most companies call bookings, typically exceed reported revenues by a few percent although this amount varies depending on the deal mix in any given quarter. In essence, Wix is building up a large base of deferred revenues that are getting collected monthly and which should lead to accelerating cash flows.The other thing to note is that for Wix guidance is not really guidance. The company actually presented a slide in this quarter's investor presentation that has a subhead called Potential Additional Drivers. For example, the current forecast includes no contribution from Wix Code, although that's the company's largest new product launch to date. The slide also speaks to the potential of unannounced new products. In addition, the guidance includes little impact from the company's DeviantArt solutions, a product that was acquired last year and which is just now getting monetized. It is fair to state that based on the company's subscription model, new users of new products are not going to drive an overwhelming contribution in any given time period. That said, however, it would not particularly surprise this writer to see Wix achieve reported revenue growth of 50% or more this year - again, the company has no revenue experience with Wix Code which has a larger addressable market than the totality of what Wix has addressed to date.Focusing on collections - or basically bookings, and not including the contribution from products particularly including Wix Code which is just newly offered in a production version, are quite likely to noticeably change the financial outlook of the business. I think, realistically, that Wix revenues this year are likely to reach $650 million, and I would not be surprised to see them reach as much as $900 million in 2019. Wix is not the ultimate e-commerce vendor. While it competes with Shopify (SHOP) at the margin, it simply is not the way users set up e-commerce retail sites, and it never will be. But this company will continue to benefit from its position and trends that continue to support the growth in e-commerce offerings beyond retail. Simply put, if an entrepreneur wants to sell products on the web, his first choice these days will be the creation of a SHOP store. But if an entrepreneur wants to create a website to offer services of various kinds, then the Wix set of solutions has captured the No. 1 position. And with the advent of Wix code, that lead will almost inevitably grow.Wix has achieved very high levels of gross margins, and it is not reasonable to suggest that it can exceed current levels in any meaningful fashion. In Q4, the company reported GAAP gross margins of 85%, up marginally from the prior year. Gross margins will likely decline somewhat in 2018 as the company will include the royalties the company pays to Google for G-Suite as part of its cost of goods.The company's R&D spend is an outlier even in the context of hyper-growth tech names and continues to increase. Last quarter, the company spent 37% of its revenue on research and development, compared to 34% in the prior year's period. Research and development spending rose by almost 10% sequentially. Some of this is organic, and some of this represents the appreciation of the Israeli shekel in Q4. Wix does essentially all of its development in Israel, and the Shekel appreciated by a few percent on average during Q4. As it happens, the Shekel has declined significantly against the USD so far in this quarter. The elevated level of the cost of research and development is a continuation of some of the trends experienced in the prior quarter. Back then, some analysts thought the company was over-spending on research and development, and because of the headline earnings miss, the shares were pummeled.As it happens, the sequential growth in research and development spending was a bit faster in Q4 than it was in Q3. Investors simply seem to have adjusted their expectations to reflect both the issues of the shekel and the fact that getting Wix Code ready for mass distribution to the professional developer market is costing lots of development dollars. Ultimately, Wix Code is going to address a different market segment than that addressed by Wix so far, and one said to be double the size of the market that has heretofore been targeted by Wix. Without going into the details, the cohort analysis presented in the slide presentation suggests that Wix is well advised to continue to spend heavily on research and development, given the company's ability to sell its newly developed products into its installed base.Wix also spends liberally on sales and marketing, just not quite as much compared to other hyper-growth companies in terms of its percentages. Last quarter, sales and marketing expense was 43% of revenues, down from 47.5% of revenues in the prior year. Sales and marketing expense actually fell a little sequentially, although there can be a bit of seasonality in spend on that category with Q4 seeing a low point in spending because it is a seasonal low for new customer acquisitions. Wix has no direct sales people, and this gives it the flexibility to scale its customer acquisition program without having to hire a substantial level of new personnel.General and administrative costs are rather elevated and have yet to show meaningful leverage. They grew by 10.6% sequentially last quarter and were up by more than 85% year on year. That level of cost increase suggests that the company is building a substantial infrastructure and that there are meaningful opportunities to constrain the future growth of that expense line.Overall, operating expenses were 91.5% of revenue on a GAAP basis last quarter compared to 90.5% of revenues the prior year. As mentioned, Wix has focused on cash flow rather than reported profitability, but it has focused most of all on revenue growth and customer acquisition given the ability it has had to drive revenue from within its installed base. Last quarter, Wix added another 170k net premium subscribers, that is those who pay, and added 5.3 million registered users. The increase in paying customers in 2017 Q4 was consistent with that metric the prior year. The growth in premium users is typically at a nadir in Q4 compared to other quarters during the year. Overall, premium subscribers increased from 2.5 million to 3.2 million over the course of the year, and the average revenue per premium user continued to increase. The company has increased its conversion rate of new users to a certain extent. Overall, registered users rose by 22% while paying customers rose by 28%. As registered users have now reached the 119 million level, it is reasonable to believe that the rate of growth in that metric will decline in percentage terms going forward.Wix Code had 144k registered users at the start of 2018, a metric management said was ahead of company expectations. At this point, Wix charges Code users the same pricing that is the case for all other classes of pro users. The company hasn't reported the number of paying customers for Code although it is almost certainly in the low thousands at this point and has not had a discernible impact on revenue metrics. It wouldn't be surprising to see the company start to charge a premium price for Code - the product provides more value for users who can build a more elaborate website using the technology, and certainly, I expect to see the company achieve at least a six-figure cohort of paying Code customers by the end of the current year. It would be reasonable to anticipate that by the end of 2018, Code will be contributing a few hundred basis points to revenue and will be a factor in driving percentage growth beyond the forecast the company provided this quarter.WIX provides investors a very detailed set of revenue metrics in its investor presentation. I do not think it is necessary to review all of the items on these charts for the purposes of this article. That said, it is worth noting that the average revenue per new subscriber has continued its advance and reached a record last quarter. That in turn is a function of the company's pace of new product creation. Recently, the company has introduced a new editor, has enhanced its store capability, has created a template for entertainment bookings, enhanced its video capability and added both a music and a ""ShoutOut"" capability to its stack. Wix offers its users lots to buy and it has a vast population (119 million registered users) to which it can sell. Last year, it was able to increase the annual revenue value per new subscriber by 23%, which is a remarkable accomplishment.As mentioned, WIX is highly focused on free cash flow as the metric it tracks more than reported non-GAAP profitability. The level of deferred revenue increase it has been able to achieve suggests that this is a reasonable focus. Last quarter, CFFO grew by about 25% compared to the prior year, and it more than doubled during all of 2017. Much of the increase in cash flow last year was a function of the increase in stock-based comp which accounted for a bit more than half of CFFO last quarter. Overall, stock-based comp was 57% of CFFO in 2017 compared to 70% of that metric the prior year.I have written about WIX in the recent past, and I don't propose to do much more than update a bit of what I have written. WIX continues to be the leading company in its space. Back in October, I linked to a number of evaluations of Wix versus its competitors. There are some new surveys - they still reach the same conclusions. I have linked to one here for the convenience of readers, but this is a large space with many potential customers for tools to build websites. Readers can find many alternative comparisons of the tools offered competitors. I think it is fair to say that Wix has more apps and templates that address specific verticals than its competitors and that is often why it wins.I would have liked to have more specific quantification regarding the market for website building tools. Indeed, it is difficult to find the category into which Wix solutions fit. Neither Gartner or Forrester have a category for Wix although they both publish studies on what they describe as Digital Experience Platforms. So, readers are going to have to take the TAMs that have been suggested in many studies with a bit of skepticism - there isn't any real substantiation. The one thing that seems to be obvious is that with the advent of Wix Code, the ability the company has to address a far larger market than heretofore is striking.One of its principal competitors is an infelicitously named enterprise called GoDaddy (GDDY). This is apparently the competitor that Wix watches most closely - or at least that is the impression I obtained when talking to company management. As it happened, GoDaddy reported its quarterly results earlier this week. GoDaddy is perhaps better recognized as the leading provider of domain names, but it does compete directly with Wix. It is a bit hard to evaluate GDDY's relative growth vs. Wix as it has recently made some significant acquisitions which have led to very rapid reported growth. The part of GDDY that competes directly with Wix is quite a bit smaller and has far slower organic growth - but trying to create an apples to apples comparison is not feasible at this point. There's no evidence that the competition in this space has changed substantially in the last four months since I last reviewed Wix. This company has many advantages based on relatively newer offerings that are targeted at specific verticals. Its pricing is probably in the middle of the pack - sometimes, one vendor or the other runs a promotion, but overall pricing has been stable for some time now and seems likely to remain that way.While Wix is likely to continue to introduce additional features and functions and to expand its vertical capabilities, its largest growth opportunity is Code. The market research studies that Wix has consulted suggest that Code, which is designed to be used by professional developers more than by website operators, addresses a market at least twice the size of the market that is currently addressed by the Wix product. I really can't find any readily available studies that are on-point with the TAM addressed by Wix Code, but based on anecdotal evidence, it seems likely that most website operators do use a professional website designer to develop their property.Clearly, the success of Code is key to evaluating the long-term prospects for Wix. The initial auguries appear positive. It will be at least another 2-3 quarters before there's adequate quantification from company reporting regarding user demand for Code to evaluate either the ultimate magnitude or the cadence of this opportunity. In the meantime, I think that even without a substantial uplift from Code revenues, the proliferation of revenue contribution from all of the new Wix applications should enable the company to deliver growth in the 40% range, excluding the impact of both the change in accounting for G-Suite revenues and the impact of the adoption of ASC-606.A couple of weeks ago, the world - or at least the stock market - was in a correction. Two weeks later and the issuance of several hundred earnings reports, and the outlook for equities has a far more roseate hue even despite somewhat questionable datum regarding inflation and other economic metrics. Valuing Wix has lots to do with whether the current business environment remains on a positive trend as much as it does anything specific to do with the company's operational performance. The shares are up almost 28% since their nadir on February 8. That said, the shares have basically retraced the move down that they made down from the end of July when the company's second quarter results were viewed as disappointing. In that regard, the shares have substantially underperformed the IGV, which has appreciated by about 18% over that time span. While a 28% move seems substantial, in context, it is far less so.Wix currently has a market capitalization of $6.2 billion based on its latest reported shares. Outstanding shares rose 7.5% during the last reporting quarter, and that is consistent in terms of growth percentage with the rate of the last year. The company has about $230 million of total cash on its balance sheet, so its current enterprise value is about $6 billion. Based on my view of the current growth cadence of revenue growth, and management commentary regarding its guidance, as opposed to using the First Call consensus numbers as a revenue projection, I think the forward 12-month EV/S calculation is about 9.2X.Is that too high? That's one of those arguments for which there's no single right answer. If Wix can continue to grow at 40% on a consistent basis for several years, it isn't particularly high or even an outlier. If Code is successful, which will generate that kind of growth, then the EV/S valuation is attractive. If the web design space continues to grow as it has, then the tools that Wix sells will continue to show outsized revenue growth. The Digital Experience category seems to this writer to be more at its start than to have reached any kind of saturation or maturity.Wix has not achieved profitability, and it is unlikely to do so in the next couple of years. I think it is fair to say that many observers, and that includes this author and investor, would not like to see Wix slow down the growth of either its marketing spend or its research and development activities. Frankly, while there are doubtless efficiencies to be had in almost any activity growing at 50%, the key is really the productivity that Wix is achieving from its investments. Just as an example, the evolution of the Wix AI functionality is one of the reasons why the company scores well with its users and why its growth has reaccelerated. Investors do not buy Wix shares because of any expectations of near-term earnings or substantial improvement in operating margin metrics.As mentioned, Wix does highlight its cash flow and free cash flow numbers as a reasonable way to value the company and to measure its progress. Projecting cash flow margins for almost any company is a highly fraught undertaking. I have no real way of knowing the track for stock-based comp. I hope it won't rise 71% this year, and it shows signs of lower percentage growth to come in the latest reported quarter. But I claim no second sight in projecting that metric. Can deferred revenues grow faster than they did in 2017 on a percentage basis? I actually think that's likely based on some decent ramp for Wix Code. The company is not projecting any increase in the growth of deferred revenues in dollar terms next year and that seems more than a bit unlikely. CFFO doubled last year, and free cash flow grew by 95%. Overall, I think that the current forecast for free cash flow of about $100 million for the year, while showing 40% growth from the 2017 attainment, is likely to prove far below a more likely number. I think free cash flow could reach $125 million next year based on slight improvements in GAAP operating margins - particularly if general and administrative costs are better contained and because the increase in deferred revenues will grow as well. My forecast of a free cash flow yield is thus just about 2% - not a metric that's going to support share price appreciation in the short term.Again, the issue is growth. If the company does achieve my expectations, and free cash flow margins turn up substantially, then the investment case is well supported. It is basically as simple as that. Wix has been and remains the leader in one of the sub-components of the Digital Experience category. The overall Digital Experience category is showing rapid growth, and Wix is expanding its product footprint, with a fair amount of visible success. I do not think the recent share price increase should deter readers from initiating or expanding positions in these shares. They can readily produce positive alpha based on the kind of operating success the company is delivering."
4134488,104014,2017-12-29T16:26:10-05:00,"The AI software market is expected to grow 28x between 2016 and 2025.The high cost and low supply of AI programmers will create huge demand for AI driven software and web services in the years to come.Alteryx, Inc. and Wix.com are both well positioned to grow within this sector of the AI Revolution.","This series has already investigated GPU chip designers and a data storage manufacturer as direct play on the AI Revolution. This article will take a leap downstream of the market and check out two small to medium-cap players in the software and web design sectors poised for big growth ahead.AI as a software is expected to grow from $3.2B in 2016 to $89.8B by 2025, according to research firm Tractica. This represents a 28x increase from last year and provides a peek at the potential opportunity ahead of us as investors. A recent article from NYTimes paints the picture clear:The supply-demand for AI programmers is disproportionately skewed. 10,000 AI experts is only 1 per 755,000 people in the world for an industry that forecast to add 1.7% to global GDP by 2035. Competition for these programmers is so fierce that companies are willing to pay incentives well above their $500k salaries. This means that small and medium sized businesses are unable to afford an AI programmer on their staff to keep up with larger competition. Enter AI software.AI as a software offers the benefits of Deep Learning at a fraction of the development costs. Software developers absorb the exceedingly high costs of AI programmers and amortize those costs out by selling subscription packages for the AI software. Meanwhile, the small and medium sized businesses owners reap the benefit of having AI capabilities at their fingertips.Based on a recent study from Alteryx presented in their investor presentation, 94% of organizations use multiple data resources with 60%+ managing five or more different sources. This translates into hours lost manually manipulated and combing through data. Extensive data sets must be access, prepared, and cleansed before being integrated to allow for analytical coding. Expensive software and labor are usually required to create the app for output. This is where AYX makes its value proposition: delivering machine learning/AI capability to the common business user.The nice thing about AYX is that its platform is scalable and can pull in additional data sources to learn from, like census, credit scores, traffic and maps, etc. Being an all-encompassing SAS provider, any average Joe like myself can run analytics without needing coding or advanced analytical skills. This means I can harness the power of deep learning to spot trends and opportunities with my business that would have otherwise been nearly impossible.What’s so impressive about AYX is that it has a very diverse blue-chip customer base with household names like P&G, GE, Ford, HP, Microsoft, Home Depot, McDonald’s Coke. This not only establishes a broad foundation of revenue streams, but reinforces AYX’s calculated TAM of $19B from 2016. Add in the additional $10B opportunity from the 21 million advanced data prep spreadsheet users worldwide, and AYX has a huge opportunity ahead of it.Since 2014, AYX has seen 50% CAGR revenues and 52% y/y revenue growth this year alone. Meanwhile, cost of goods sold and operating expenses only grew 31% and 35% y/y, significantly outpaced by revenues. While the company is not forecast to be earning positive before 2019, its free cash flows (FCF) have entered positive territory at $6.4M over the trailing twelve months. This is a positive sign for future valuation of the stock and opens the door for more analyst coverage as the stock becomes easier to value.Image Source: Excel Spreadsheet using Income Statement dataManagement also expects both its gross margins and operating margins to increase over time, eventually allowing the company to start reporting positive earnings.Most of AYX’s operating costs are employee related. It also sports a very clean and easy to follow income statement. 95% of its revenues originate from its subscription revenue model, translating into a highly visible business model. AYX also sports a 133% net revenue retention and has no unusual expenses to report. All in all, this company should be an easy one to monitor and follow as an investment.AYX sits on a very comfortable cash position of $95M with no long-term debt, which makes me comfortable as an investor. With current year forecast revenues at $129M and a P/S ratio of 11, AYX is just beginning to scratch the surface on its potential opportunity.But buyer beware. At $1.5B market cap, this is a small cap stock sitting 25% above its Morningstar fair value after rocketing 67% this year. This makes it a prime target for short seller attacks near term. For those with patience and a longer runway however, this stock appears to have the legs and room to run.The nearest comparable company to Wix.com would be GoDaddy.com if GoDaddy were to grow an artificially intelligent brain and develop its own eye for design. WIX originally laid its foundation as a web site developer, but has sense blasted away all competition by introducing the world’s first web development package run by artificial intelligence.New subscribers to WIX are asked a few simple questions about the user’s business before the AI algorithms comb through billions of website designs to find the perfect customized match. This process only takes a couple of minutes and even gathers content from around the web and social media to strengthen the user’s website.Subscription are inexpensive, ranging from $5 to $40. This business model appears to be working as customer retention is extremely high and revenues continue to accelerate. WIX has essentially created a self-sustaining revenue model where each year brings addiitonal revenues to its recurring subscription base. As of this last quarter, revenues accelerated 46% y/y, faster than the 43% growth in each of the prior two yearsImage Source: Company Overview November - December 2017However, like AYX, WIX also reports earnings in the red. But it appears that they are managing spending exceedingly well as OPEX continues to fall as a percent of revenues. This is a great sign for investors and puts them on pace for positive earnings of $0.52 per share in 2018. FCF’s are already positive for WIX and grew an impressive 91% y/y to $70M on a TTM basis. This is a good sign for those looking for some certainty in the value of the stock, as fair value analysis using DCF is much more reliable when FCF is historically positive.With a heavy 53% of its employees devoted to R&D and already strong history of innovation, it appears WIX should continue to lead the market in innovation and gain market share. Below are results from WIX’s search traffic from Google Trends, showing an increase in interest relative to its competition. With an absence of market share information, this is a decent gauge on whether a service provider is gaining in popularity or not.Finally, WIX’s sticky subscription model appears to incentive users to roll their agreements into an annual subscription, as shown below in the subscription breakdown. Most small to medium sized business owners would prefer to deal with the day to day of operations and avoid losing focus in the weeds of website development. This is where I see WIX differentiating itself in that its AI algorithms do all of the thinking and designing for you. Having a superior AI manage your website at an low cost is significantly more attractive than spending the hours yourself and forking up the cash for a professional developer.I like WIX at its current price, which is a hair north of its Morningstar fair value of $59 per share and only 6.9 P/S ratio with a history of 40%+ annual revenues growth.Based on this high level analysis, WIX appears to be the more attractive buy based on today's share prices. Longer term, AYX may be better positioned to grow as it sells a more diverse product line to deep pocketed customers within a larger market. As mentioned in previous articles, I will wait to see which way the wind blows into the New Year and look to buy both should the market (and these AI related stocks) correct."

(NASDAQ:WIX) will acquire customer loyalty platform Flok for an undisclosed sum.Flok promises to help Wix provide a suite of CRM offerings for physical retailers wishing to increase engagement with their mobile-oriented customers.The deal was announced in the same week as the disclosure of a significant investment position by Mangrove Investments, which may or may not be related.Flok should be an capable addition to WIX' suite of digital presence offerings to businesses.Target CompanyNew York-based Flok was founded in 2011 as LoyaltyBlocks by co-founders Ido Gaver and Eran Kirshenboim.Flok has created a system that enables businesses to design their own loyalty mobile app to increase prospect and customer engagement.The app creates a 'punch card' that is activated every time the user enters the retailers local store.Retailers can also allow for in-app purchases, push notifications, chat and email messages to users.Below is a brief explainer video:(Source: Flok YouTube)The company raised $18.9 million in funding from investors including General Catalyst Partners, Gemini Israel Ventures and Founder Collective.Monthly pricing for the service ranges from $16.58 to $99.91.Acquisition Terms, Rationale and CommentaryThe acquisition price was not disclosed.Related to the acquisition, Wix also stated, ""The acquisition is not expected to have a material impact on Wix's non-GAAP operating results.""The target company was still at a relatively early stage of development and raised under $20 million in venture capital, so it is likely the acquisition price didn't exceed $40 million in total consideration.Wix, which has historically offered businesses the ability to easily create an online presence, aims to grow its ecommerce suite for off-line retailers as well.To that end, it just announced an integration with Square (NYSE:SQ) to provide its 98 million customers with the ability 'to accept online and in-person credit card payments.'The company's acquisition of Flok is intended to continue to bolster its commerce-oriented offerings for physical retailers.Flok's mobile-oriented application is a good fit for Wix' ambitions to allow retailers to manage their CRM via mobile or tablet devices.WIX stock has reacted positively in the days after the announcement, increasing from $52.50 to $56 per share in the days since the deal was disclosed, a rise of 6.7%.However, the jump in price was not a direct result from the deal announcement, rather from an SEC filing indicating Mangrove Investments and affiliates have disclosed a significant stake in the company.It isn't known if the disclosure is connected to the acquisition of Flok.In any event, assuming WIX didn't overpay for Flok, the new capability indicates that management is focused on continuing to take advantage of opportunities to grow its business, with a focus on off-line businesses.That's a net positive for the stock aside from the Mangrove activity.I write about IPOs, follow-ons, secondaries, and M&A.

4073299,98236,2017-05-16T11:56:48-04:00,"Last week, WIX reported its Q1 financial results.The results showed growth accelerating and guidance was increased by an amount greater than the Q1 beat.The company saw improvement in all of the major metrics that investors use to track this company.The problem for new investors is that lots of the good news has already been noted and the shares reflect very strong growth expectations.The next leg up of the share price, if there is to be one, is going to require a significant level of success from the company's newer product initiatives.","Is there any stopping this company or perhaps more importantly its shares?One of my goals as a columnist/investor on this site is to find new, less discovered names in the IT world. Names that I would never have otherwise known and companies that I might never have decided to look at. Somehow, while this is my initial article about Wix (NASDAQ:WIX), I can hardly claim to be discovering a dusty quarter or an unknown component of the enterprise software world. I wish I had seen it a few quarters ago - although at that time it might have appeared as a company that was seeing results that were regressing to the mean. That is no longer the case.I can't quite bring myself to pull the trigger on Wix shares at its current valuation and the current valuation of IT shares in general. The run in the space since the first of the year has been remarkable and it is hard to believe that it will be sustainable. And if IT shares in general have been strong, the shares of WIX have been stronger still, although perhaps with some reasonable justification. I think it is reasonable to get to understand Wix, but for myself, I intend to wait for a less super-stressed entry point.That being said, Wix, in terms of its operating numbers, has really seen a break-out run just these last two quarters with a material growth reacceleration and significant beat and raise quarters. To a greater or lesser extent, the break-out flat-footed many analysts who were not focused on the company's potential or who just couldn't believe in the company's re-accelerating growth. About the best I can say for myself is that I wasn't in that group because I wasn't even watching at the time.In the quarter reported this past week, the company grew revenues by 50% year on year and it added 8% sequentially to its paid user base which has now reached 2.7 million. Its total user count reached 103 million, up another 6% sequentially.The beat was a considerable surprise to many with both Raymond James and Cantor Fitzgerald dropping their ratings in front of earnings. Some brokerages had to increase their price targets which had recently been in the low $50 range at an exceptionally steep rate (RBC raised its price target from $59 to $83 while still maintaining a Sector Perform rating) and the mean price target has now reached the mid-$80/share.Consensus earnings estimates, as reported to First Call have escalated sharply, rising from $.21 to $.34 for the current year and from $.86 to $1.03 for 2018. Those numbers probably are lagging behind the actual consensus which I believe will settle at EPS of $1.25 for 2018 and $1.90+ for 2019. Analyst ratings have been in flux as the shares have rocketed upward faster than estimates.Wix has only been around for a decade, but it has already marked out its space as perhaps the ""go-to"" site for building a web site. It is best known as the ""the flexible website builder."" Its tools have given birth to something over 100 million web sites. What is even more amazing is that number has more than doubled just since 2014. It has become the leading player in the website builder landscape, and while headquartered in Israel, it also has a co-headquarters in a city called Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, from which it achieves noticeable economies in terms of development costs and its effective tax rate.The company has attracted the attention of a professional short-seller on this site, so far without noticeable impact to its share price, which recently made a new high and is up 77% just this year to date. Over the past year, the shares have actually trebled as the company has made a decisive turn toward profitability and faster growth.The report of the short-seller was issued prior to the last earnings report. The last earnings report basically made hash of many of the arguments presented about the primary metrics that were used to support the short thesis. It might have been informative to see some kind of update as to the assertions in the report in light of the actual results that WIX published last week.One of the problems with this kind of report is that it is completely polemical in nature without any pretense of objectivity. Because of the operating/writing style of the authors, it can be difficult to objectively assess some of their assertions. That doesn't necessarily mean that all of the points of the authors are inaccurate. The space in which this company operates is crowded and no one would suggest that this company is without seemingly viable competitors.That said, the associations of the company's CFO and auditors are perhaps troublesome and are not something that can be blithely dismissed. Still, the fact that VCs have sold their shares is not terribly surprising. In fact, most of them have charters that oblige them to do just that. And the company has dramatically escalated its spend on audit as suggested by the doubling of its general and administrative costs year on year last quarter.Needless to say, with that kind of share price increases, readers might think at this point that valuation is probably stretched and that the shares have one of those hyper-valuations that are so unloved by many investors. The shares are certainly not cheap. On the other hand, the performance of the shares has basically kept valuations at levels comparable to other hyper-growth IT names. The 50% growth just reported was far from expected and share prices have responded accordingly.While certainly not cheap, the shares are certainly not outliers either given the rapid growth of the company's revenues. The world is inexorably moving to the web with regards to commerce and business interaction, and this is a company solidly athwart the trend.The article will consider the company's valuation in more depth later on. But the current market cap metric based on about 45 million shares outstanding and Friday's closing price per share of $78.30 is $3.5 billion. The company has $160 million of cash as of the end of its last reporting period and has become cash flow positive, mainly due to the company's very rapid increase in deferred revenues. So, with an enterprise value of $3.4 billion, and revenues forecast by the company to be $422 million for this year, which would be growth in the 45%-46% range, the EV/S is 8X. Is it reasonable to recommend shares with an EV/S of 8X? It is a very fraught question for this writer and frankly there is an element of unease in trying to justify that metric even though all too many hyper-growth IT companies have such a valuationThis company forecasts free cash flow. As part of that forecast, it is important to understand that its collections range significantly above expected recognized revenues. Its newly revised forecast for free cash flow is now $68 million for the current year. At that level, the free cash flow yield on the company's current market cap would be over 2%, again certainly not in bargain territory but not a substantial outlier amongst its comps, either.I do not think that anyone buying these shares at this time is doing so because of how they screen on traditional valuation metrics. Most analysts, to support their recommendations, are doing so based on some multiple of 2018 numbers. And more than a few throw in 2019 numbers just to prove their points. I confess my own view of 2019 at this point is that of distant shore, dimly perceived.That is not all that unusual to be sure these days with the calendar in May, and most estimates on 2018 numbers are based on some kind of reversion to the mean, but the exercise of assuming 35%+ growth simply to get to a price target a few percent about current levels is not a comfortable set of assumptions for this writer. Investors in WIX, as is the case with other hyper-growth names, are there for the growth and not much more than the growth. In this case, they get a bit of cash flow and reported earnings, but not nearly enough to make a viable purchase case at current valuation for the shares.The 24% YTD rise in IT shares cited earlier is more than a bit remarkable. There are many possible explanations for that kind of performance. Some commentators have suggested that growth stocks are back in style because the Trump Trade, as it relates to basic economy stocks, is no longer considered to be a sure thing. One thing that is happening for sure is that there has been a trade that relates to sale of shares in traditional retail related companies in favor of buying shares in companies which are growing fat on the carcass of what is considered a withering part of the economy. Shortage of rapid growth names, poor financial performance of retail companies, strong current operational performance from many IT vendors and some interesting pieces of technology such as Big Data and AI which are accelerating future CAGRs in a noticeable fashion are all likely suspects in the aggressive share price increases most recently seen in the space.The index that best encapsulates the trend, the IGV, has appreciated by 7% in the last month and by 11% in the last quarter. That is simply not a sustainable cadence, and while certainly the correlation between WIX and the IGV is not anywhere close to perfect, it seems likely that as the appreciation potential of the IGV decreases over the short term, the same will be true for WIX shares as well.Naturally, I would like to see a bit of a pullback and less general approbation of so many names in the space. But I think I have to be on the lookout for Wix with the hope of being able to acquire it on any kind of visible pullback.Wix is well known for having spent an incredible amount of money getting itself known during the last several Super Bowls. This year's little vignette, featuring Jason Statham and Gal Gadot was all about sex, violence, the trashing of what looked like a decent restaurant and a young clean cut chef creating a web site using the tool set offered by Wix - all in 120 seconds. Presumably, these things work as this is the third time Wix has been to the festivities.Wix is often compared to Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), and of course, there are similarities between the platforms and points at which they compete. Wix has its Online Shop which is a competitor of SHOP's service. I think it is fair to say that at this writing and based on the preponderance of reviews I have seen, if a user is serious about developing a significant e-commerce presence, the choice is SHOP. If a user wants to develop a web site with lots of basic appeal and wants tools designed for non-IT savvy entrepreneurs, Wix is the probably the better fit. The pricing between the two rivals is such that anyone looking to conduct a reasonable volume of e-commerce will wind up paying about the same, even though at the moment, Wix does not charge transaction fees. The link shown above actually finds Wix ""better"" than SHOP, but it is one of many and I threw it in because it displays nicely.But clearly, just given the numbers, SHOP and WIX currently address two different markets and fill two quite different roles on the Web. Will the future see these two companies converge? Probably. Should that concern investors? Not particularly. These are big spaces and for years will have different vendors with different approaches to similar problems. Just how big? That is another question that needs to be addressed in this article.Some of the latest data suggest that new website birth continues at a prodigious rate. The link above shows many statistics that all reach the same conclusion. There are lots of new web sites and they have to be designed. These days, apparently, about 70% of new websites are designed by professionals while the balance of new designs use DIY tools such as those sold by WIX.There are various complications that are important in considering the potential CAGR of Wix. If nothing else, the company offers 5 different service levels from free to Elite. I think looking at the CAGR potential is a good place to start a dive into the investment merits of this company.WIX - A Freemium Model within an enormous categoryJust how large is the business opportunity that WIX addresses and where does it stand competitively? These are two of the factors that are necessary to establish in trying to develop a longer term CAGR expectation for the company. This article is about whether or not to invest in Wix and is not intended to provide a guide as to which website builder to choose. Given what Wix does and who is its intended customer base, there will, no doubt, be plenty of readers who have both personal experience with the product and their own evaluation of how it stacks up competitively.But for what it is worth, as seen in the link here, and frankly on other sites as well, Wix gets the top marks across basically all of the major categories. Its closest competitors in the space are said to be Squarespace and Weebly and ratings drop very sharply below these three.Another competitor to look at is WordPress. WordPress is the ultimate ""do-it-yourself"" experience for creating web sites. As such, it is cheaper than Wix. I have linked to a rather in-depth review here if anyone has interest. In general, Wix will be more acceptable for the mass of users who want to create a website that is quick to build and easy to deploy.Unfortunately, none of the reports cited in these links really answer the question as to what the market might be for the tools that Wix and its competitors sell. Given that registered users are growing rapidly, with no signs of a slowdown, I think it is reasonable to conclude that the market opportunity for DIY website tools remains far from saturated.But there is the issue of trying to determine how much of the market is based on professionals designing websites for users under contracts, how much of it is from enterprises which have their own IT efforts and need to pivot to online presentations and how much of the market is DIY. And while Shopify doesn't directly compete with Wix, they are both, most often, included in the same bucket when it comes to market research analysis.As an investor, I really only care about determining if the market places constraints on the available growth rate for Wix. As best as I can tell, it really doesn't. The linked article here is a bit old, but I think the points it makes about the size of the available market for the DIY approach and just how nascent the space is suggest that the runway for Wix ought to be more than enough to support hyper-growth for some years to come. Trying to present anything more precise at this point would be gross misrepresentation.Wix is supposed to achieve 36% growth next year to achieve the consensus forecast. Indeed, I would argue that it has to grow a bit faster than 36% in order to support its now-current valuation. That is, no doubt, a hefty number. But so far as I can determine, the available market is certainly large enough and growing fast enough and Wix has a more than adequate competitive position to achieve that kind of growth rate for the next couple of years. Indeed, the recent addition of Wix Video into the mix probably increases the chances of the company achieving top line targets. Video is becoming such a key consideration in the design of websites and their appeal to users. The introduction of tools to add video to Wix powered websites is likely to have a noticeable impact on demand, I believe, and it has yet to become a major factor in the consensus growth forecast. A couple of quarters ago, the company launched a tool that uses artificial intelligence to create websites. That initiative may be one of the reasons behind the re-accelerating growth. It is a unique property that has yet to be incorporated by the company's competitors.The company has intimated that it has other substantive product announcements coming shortly, but what these might be and what their impact could be on numbers is unknowable at this point.In the wake of the results achieved last quarter and the broad-based strength the company is seeing, it is hard to make the case that the company has problems with its market space, its competitive positioning, its product mix or its overall sales execution.Wix - A raft of numbers that are mainly investor friendlyIn this era of massive quantification, Wix, like its peers, presents many numbers which analysts hang on. I won't purport to try to comment on all of them, but I will touch a few of the highlights just to address the issue of relevant trends. I think the guts of the Wix story when it comes to financial progress can be seen in the chart the company presented as part of its deck of financial performance slides.Over the last 12 months, the company has increased the number of its registered users by 25%, it has been able to add to the base of paid subscriptions by 38% and the paying customers have increased their spend on Wix by 51%. Within those numbers, deferred revenues are rising slightly faster than reported revenues due to more users choosing longer-term, prepaid subscriptions.Why is that happening? I think the simplest answer is that the market space continues strong; the web has long since become the go-to home for entrepreneurs and Wix has become the go-to home for those designing websites themselves and not focused on creating an e-commerce store.There remains a tremendous market opportunity for Wix to convert its installed base which totals over 100 million registered users as compared to 2.7 million currently paid subscriptions. And there is significant opportunity to increase revenues that are coming from new subscriptions. That number has increased 10% in the last year alone and is one reason for the company's growth in cash flow.The company has seen modest improvements in GAAP expense ratios, although not yet at a rate that will lead to an end to GAAP losses. Last quarter, gross margins increased by 150 bps year on year. Last quarter, general and administrative costs doubled on a GAAP basis, while research and development rose by one-third and sales and marketing rose just short of 40%. It's expensive to hire Jason Statham and Gal Gadot for a Super Bowl commercial experience. Overall, opex growth was 39% compared to revenue growth of 51%. So, the GAAP loss margins fell from 32% to 22%.The company's operating leverage has been greater than the performance seen by many other hyper-growth companies. Given that the company spends more than 1/3rd of its revenues on research and development and an elevated 59% of revenues on sales and marketing, there are huge targets for further improvement. The math suggests that it was costing more in Q1 to acquire premium users than in the year earlier period, but that was more than offset by the increased spending of the new users. It is a reasonable trade, and one that is a positive and not a negative for investors. As mentioned, one professional short seller presented a case that the company's sub-headline numbers showed deteriorating metrics. At least in the eyes of this observer, those trends are simply not visible.ValuationHow does one rationally value a company like this. Given the growth rate and the revised guidance, the shares are not outrageously expensive on a relative basis. But given what has happened in the world of IT shares thus far this year, it is hard to make the case that valuations are anything but stretched - not for this company specifically, but in the space as a whole. Rather than reprise the specific metrics of which I am fond, none of which are really flashing some kind of buy indication at this point, I will simply make a few observations about what might convert me to a lover from a friend as the lyrics of that song go.The company has several product initiatives, two announced (AI and now video) and one scheduled for release in June. Will they be enough to move the growth needle? By how much and how long?The company reported a decent set of numbers with regards to expense management. It is still growing opex swiftly, but at a rate noticeably less than revenue. Can it improve the efficiency of those spend ratios significantly over the next couple of quarters?The companies deferred revenue balance growth continues to outpace the growth in revenues. How long can that continue? And the virtuous cycle in which active user growth exceeds total user growth and in which average revenue per active user continues to rise is strong medicine. How much of it is possible to forecast?Sometimes the prudent thing to do is to say, ""I need more data points."" I like Wix. I like what it does and I like the moat it is building and I like the model. Unfortunately, it is no dusty corner. If growth rates compress next year, which is the published consensus, then the shares are a bit rich for my taste. And if the new product initiatives create more value than the consensus forecast, there is still some - but not huge positive alpha up ahead. I would like to conclude with a buy recommendation. But I simply haven't enough confidence that growth will not compress to get to that point at this time."

The company says the site has more than 325 million pieces of original art, over 40 million registered members, and more than 65 million unique visitors per month.DeviantArt raised at least $13.5 million in two financing rounds from investors including DivX, Emagen Investment Group and corporate investor Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK).Competitors to DeviantArt include the following artist community sites:Other competitive sites include niche sites based on the type of artwork created, such as photography, film, music, craft art, written art, etc. DeviantArt is generally considered the largest art site online, though most of its contributors are believed to be ""amateur"" or aspiring artists.Other online communities serve professional artists as more of their core focus.Acquisition Terms, Rationale and CommentaryWix has acquired DeviantArt for $36 million in cash and also adjusted its 2017 revenue guidance upward by $8 million concurrent with the transaction announcement. Thus, it appears that Wix paid approximately 4.5x forward revenues for the deal.The company also expects to invest $8 million in DeviantArt for ""R&D and marketing, integration costs, employee retention bonus payments and other transaction related expenses."" The management intends to bring its ease-of-use technology and marketing expertise to the DeviantArt community platform and continue to operate the business as a standalone entity, with all of its employees remaining at the firm.With the deal, Wix appears to be expanding its current focus of providing technologies to help users build their own websites to now operating ""online collaboration and communities.""If management can successfully monetize the DeviantArt community acquisition by combining Wix's online technologies and marketing knowledge, we can expect Wix to pursue additional acquisitions of online communities in the future.Many online communities have grown organically over the years and may have deficits in their technology and marketing capabilities. The combination of Wix's capabilities and capacity to invest in upgrading promising communities could mean a whole new business line for the company.It will take several quarters of financial performance to tell whether the DeviantArt deal can be a template for an expanded strategy.I write about IPOs, follow-ons, secondaries, and M&A.

3980676,98656,2016-06-08T08:08:46-04:00,"Since we recommended Wix in March the share price has jumped 36%, but we feel there are more gains to come.Wix appears to be capturing market share from its competitors, judging by Google Trends.Premium subscriptions grew by an impressive 41% year on year in the quarter.Wix launched an automated web design service built on artificial intelligence this week. This is designed to make the process even simpler.","There have been a few standout performers in our portfolio this year, but Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) could be the best. We bought in on Wix believing a rise in small businesses in the United States was going to be the catalyst for accelerated growth. So far this appears to have been on the money, as Wix produced a robust first quarter with year-on-year revenue growth of 40.9%. The bottom line was still loss-making, but it did come out ahead of the consensus estimate by a solitary cent.(Source: Wix.com)The effect this had on the stock was clear. Having dropped as low as $14.79 in February 2016 from $25.00 in November 2015, the stock is now touching on a 52-week at $27.50. Although we just missed the bottom, we managed to get in around the $19 level on March 2, meaning a wonderful 36% gain today.After such a strong gain it is tempting to lock in the gains. It is a thought that has come to mind numerous times, but we remain convinced there are even greater gains ahead for this growing company.One thing that impressed us most during the last quarter was the increase in its premium subscriptions. These grew 41% year-on-year to 1.938 million. As the presentation slide below shows, this is the 20th consecutive quarter in which the company has grown its premium subscriptions. The same can be said for its registered users. In our opinion, its intuitive cloud-based software, strong marketing, and growth in small businesses are the reasons for these increases.(Source: Company Presentation)The attractive pricing model continues to entice customers into signing up for annual subscriptions. In FY 2014, new customers sign ups were more or less split even between monthly and annual subscriptions, whereas today 77% of new sign-ups opt for an annual subscription. Getting customers to commit to a year at the sign up stage is a great feat and one which we believe will benefit the company down the line.We feel Wix's products are very sticky. Unless they are web developers, we imagine most customers just want to get the website side of the business done and move onto concentrating on running the business. Unless the web dramatically evolves in the near future, we think most customers will be happy with their website for a couple of years at least. After all, Wix spend a lot of time developing modern and varied website templates for its customers. Moving away from Wix to another provider would take a lot of effort, and with prices being reasonably competitive, we see little reason why customers would choose to switch.The stickiness is great news also when you consider that amongst its peers, it is looking to be far and away the most popular choice. As the Google Trends chart indicates, Wix is the runaway leader which appears to be growing market share (at least in search) at the expense of its competition. Considering it is an online business, we place a lot more emphasis on these search results than we would for many other industries. In many respects this is the equivalent of seeing foot traffic increase for a retailer.Source: Google TrendsDuring the quarter the company launched Wix Restaurants. The service provides restaurants with online order management services, enabling restaurant owners to grow and manage their business without relying on commission-based food ordering marketplaces. We think this is a great idea and will be interested to see how it is received. We still feel restaurants will have to use these commission-based food ordering marketplaces to compete, but if we were running a restaurant we would want to offer both to our customers. This is yet another up-sell product that we believe should help grow its average revenue per user.Finally, just this week Wix launched an automated web design service built on artificial intelligence. CEO and co-founder Avishai Abrahami had this to say about the service:Wix has promised that each Wix ADI website will be unique. After answering a few questions about the business and user preferences, the platform will pull in relevant photos, text, and a layout that suits the particular business and its location. We have not trialed the service, but management seems quite excited that this is a step forward in making getting online easier. If this is truly the case, then we believe it can only be good news for growth.As you may be able to tell, we are very bullish. But we do acknowledge that there are potential headwinds. There has been a lot of talk just recently about small businesses hitting a brick wall when it comes to growth. A former McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) CEO called it a small business recession, and Michael Bloomberg and Warren Buffett called on elected officials and the private sector to help small businesses expand. They believe entrepreneurs across the United States are facing barriers to growth, according to a recent editorial in USA Today. They've pinpointed the need for ""better access to capital, less burdensome regulations, more qualified workers and ability to better assimilate information technology.""If things do not improve and the entrepreneurial spirit deflates then we do envisage Wix's growth slowing. So we do feel it is worth keeping a close eye on the state of small businesses in the United States. But as things stand today, we feel Wix is in a good position to continue its growth.As we explained last time, we see a price-to-sales ratio of around 4.75 being fair for Wix and expect the company to produce full year revenue of $275 million. Based on this and an estimated 43 million shares outstanding we maintain our target price of $30.38. With the share price currently at $27.50, this would mean a return of 10.4%. In our opinion, this makes Wix a great long-term investment with a lot of growth ahead."

The Company has forecasted a ~37% increase in diluted share count.Source: WIX Shareholder Update February 2017Source: WIX Investor Presentation, February-March 2017Consider the following math:Fundamental Strains In WIX's Business ModelThere are limited barriers to entry in WIX's business, and many new competitors have entered offering a similar proposition of a free website, with the hope of upselling registered users.Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a formidable competitor that is moving into WIX's space catering to small businesses looking to build an online e-commerce presence. Adobe is also now building an Artificial Intelligence tool to automate web design. This should worry WIX, which recently released a similar ADI feature last year.Other competitors such as TRAIBL take direct aim at WIX through targeted search advertising:WIX has a deep pool of competitors, including newer ones that have recently seized more market share faster than WIX has been able to achieve since 2013. WIX has spent almost $500 million in sales and marketing and has just 0.7% market share of content management systems. The bulls would say this data shows WIX is growing market share, but we say it is fractional share gains, and others have achieved more share faster.Market Share EstimatesSource: W3Techs Survey; Note: New entrants with faster growth boldedWIX's Problem: Acquisition Costs Exploding, Growth Rate Slowing, Discounts RisingWIX Affiliate ProgramWIX does not discuss much about its ""Affiliate"" program other than a one-sentence disclosure in its 20-F Annual Report.

When asked, the CFO's explanation seemed murky and difficult to validate. He claims collections accelerated with no explanation why. We've analyzed the annual growth rates for both variables and find that they historically track each other within a couple percent. We also checked his assertion that collections growth was accelerated in 2H16, yet we don't find evidence that collections growth outpaced sales.

The Company reports almost no long-term deferred revenue. This is surprising given the nature of its business and recent new Risk Factor disclosure that it has multi-year contracts with customers. WIX also sells longer term domain registrations. Compare WIX's deferred revenue composition vs. peers below and you'll understand our concern.From the new 20-F Risk Factor addition underlined:Warning: First Sign of Revenue RestatementWIX restated its App Market revenues lower recently.

There's a lengthy discussion in the notes of the 20-F. While it is too early to determine the impact, WIX has made some disclosures that bear closer consideration. What exactly about creating a website at WIX involves ""Variable consideration and significant financing""The Company says the following:""The Company is in the process of reviewing its current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the guidance to its revenue contracts.With the assessment in its progress, the Company identified the following areas that may be affected:In addition, the Company is in the process of identifying appropriate changes to its business processes, systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new guidance.""Question Marks Around Management, Governance, and Audit IntegrityPay careful attention to WIX's CFO.

The number of subscriptions has jumped to a record level. The stock had a great performance year to date. Many analysts questioned how far Wix can rise without posting actual profits. However, now the SaaS company has reported bigger-than-expected revenues, which show that the investments in technology and its product are starting to pay off (Earnings Call, 27 July, 2016).Competitive AdvantageA few years ago, Wix launched the App Market. This was another milestone and an astonishing product feature. You will not find anything similar at its competitors, especially nothing that works so smoothly. The editor lets you plug in a number of ""apps"" such as a booking or payment gateway. Now, service personnel can take orders even easier. You can create your own booking form on your website. And it all looks extremely professional and is very easy to edit. Those plugins have not been seen before in such a simple way.The integration is smooth and works with just one click. Apart from this, the site works in more than 15 different languages. The App Market is a one-stop shop that offers all enhancements that you need. Furthermore, social media links and plugins seem like a high priority for Wix and its clients and are included everywhere. You can even add a live chat feature on your website. All the e-commerce features are on such a high level that most competitors cannot even come close to what Wix is offering. From my point of view, the App Market is Wix's unique selling proposition and gives the firm a clear advantage over its competitors. Not only that Wix is offering many more templates for your website, but it also wins more customers with the App Market.That App Market is also extremely profitable as there is a fremium pricing model in place. Users that want to use special tools from the market can add them and pay an additional $5-15 per month to use them. You can also start accepting payments much easier than before. You have a wide variety of options ranging from PayPal to several credit cards. Its App Market can be credited with the applauses, because now Wix users can do things they'd never thought possible. There are so many terrific apps on the App Market.Wix has a global reach and has been rapidly expanding in the German-speaking area. It appeared on TV, with the advertisement now showing an increase in the German-speaking market (Wix App Market, 1 June, 2016).Weebly or Jimdo are its most known competitors in Europe. Squarespace is a US-based competitor. Jimdo is Germany based and offers much less templates, has no App Market and does not work as smoothly as Wix. It offers its users a much less sophisticated product. Wix offers a wide range and wins by being easy to use (Comparison of website editors, 20 May, 2016).Financial OverviewThe founder and CEO of Wix, Avishai Abrahami, has announced on the 26th of July 2016 that the firm now has $10 million of free cash flow. Usually, the first quarter is stronger than the second one. But this year, the second quarter was a record.Wix added a record 183,000 new subscriptions. After the announcement, the stock price jumped approximately 15%. Second-quarter revenue jumped to $68 million for this year in comparison to $48 million in 2015. That is a growth rate of 41%. Operating losses were only slightly improved.Adjusted EBITDA was $10.7 million compared to $3.5 million for the second quarter of 2015. There is an incredible momentum in the business. Higher conversion rates have helped Wix to gain more premium subscribers. Please have a look at the table below for details (Wix's record results, 27th July, 2016):New Product - The Wix ADIWix ADI stands for Wix Artificial Design Intelligence. This is a ground-breaking product that follows the App Market, and I am sure it will be the next milestone at Wix. Wix unveiled the first ever artificial intelligence solution for design and creation for desktop and mobile websites. It was designed to eliminate the most significant challenges of building websites - time, content creation and design. Wix ADI instantly produces tailored websites by learning about the user through a few simple questions and curates content to create a unique design and website. There are billions of high-quality combinations, the service selects the perfect combination for each user's need (Wix ADI, 6th July, 2016).Technical AnalysisWIX data by YChartsThere is no sign of a weakening upside trend. In April 2016, Wix broke through the 200-day average. It has also ignored its $31 resistance and previous high. That is why Wix will reach $40 very soon.ConclusionWix continues to be as creative as four years ago, and therefore, I think it is a clear buy. I am a Wix bull and simply understand that its product is so much better than its competitors. Financials are improving, and very soon Wix will be profitable. Although the stock has climbed significantly in the past months, I still think that there is more room to move higher. My target is at $45 in the coming 12 months."
4053734,94986,2017-03-09T12:12:40-05:00,"WIX reported and will continue to report strong revenue growth.The company is making headway in Latin America and Asia, while also geographically diversifying its revenue.Its freemium model enables market share capture and creates upselling opportunity.Recent acquisition of DeviantArt adds further unique points to the bull case.","Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX) is Tel Aviv-based web development platform that enables organizations to take businesses, brands and workflow online. We discovered this company in early January after looking for a platform to design and launch our website. The design experience was effortless, the company was public, and after a night of due diligence (DD) we made an investment the next day. Unfortunately, we ended up selling after one week hence the title, which stems from the night of DD that would have led to some significant capital gains had we kept our position open. Fundamentally, WIX offers investors an opportunity to gain exposure to the global internet economy, particularly in emerging nations in Asia and Latin America.Part I: The Bull CaseWhile WIX is currently not profitable, it commands a four-year revenue CAGR of 38%. FY'2016 revenue grew 43% y/y to $290mn, while collections (a non-GAAP measure for total cash collected from annual and monthly premium subscriptions) grew 42% to $342mn.Q/Q Revenue growth for WIX (Source: WIX Earnings Slides).WIX operates on a freemium business model as it provides its platform at no cost to free users. This comes with constraints such as the inability to use a custom domain name and a permanent WIX ad displayed on a site.The month-on-month cost of WIX's premium plans range from $7 for the most basic website build plan to $39.90 for the ""VIP Store"", WIX's high-end solutions for e-commerce entrepreneurs. Discounts for premium users who subscribe on a yearly or two-year plan are also used to boost collections.The premium upgrade options and their discount rate (Source: Wix.com)As at the end of Q4'2016, WIX had grown its total users to 97 million, representing y/y growth of 27%. User growth has been on an upward trajectory for the last five years, a trend that should continue into the long term. Indeed, WIX updated the market post Q4'2016 earnings release that it had reached a 100 million users.Furthermore, premium subscriptions grew 39% y/y to 2.46 million at end of FY'2016, underlying the company's ability to grow premium subscribers at a stronger rate compared to overall user growth.WIX's premium subscribers currently account for less than 3% of its total users. This, combined with the overall global increase in demand for web development platforms, creates a substantial opportunity for WIX to increase collections for the foreseeable future.Also, the rate at which users are upgrading to WIX's premium solutions has increased compared to its historical average.In Q1'2016, premium users registered during that quarter was 126,962. This grew by 60% to 203,289 by Q4 2016. Compared with the previous Q1s, this was the fastest rate of premium subscriber growth. The bull case is further compounded by the q/q increase in average collection per new annual subscription. This grew 8.5% from $141 in Q1'2016 to $153 in Q4'2016. WIX is also geographically diversifying its revenue base. This is imperative because it creates adequate exposure to the fast-growing online economies in Asia and Latin America.The most marked growth was experienced in Latin America, where its percentage of total revenue grew to 9% from 3%. This level of geographic exposure, combined with its scalable SaaS business model, potentially alludes to a company that will trade at a substantially higher valuation in 5+ years.Part II: A Valuation DilemmaValued at historic growth, WIX is expensive. The stock trades on a P/S of 9.929 compared to the industry average of 6.966. Its EV/FCF is 68.82 compared to 20.74 of its closest comparable GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) and the industry average of 24.68.Source: YChartsHowever, if you value a high-growth stock based on historic rather than forward growth, you risk losing out on substantial capital gains. Consensus estimates peg WIX's revenue to grow to $418.57 in FY'2017 and to $533.92mn in FY'2018. This results in a forward P/S of 5.08, which is lower than the current industry average. The company also has a history of beating consensus estimates so actual FY'2018 revenue may be higher. Using conservative growth figures, we forecast WIX growth through to FY'2021 and assume three scenarios in regards to what its future P/S would be.Assuming a 5-year revenue CAGR of 19.15% and a P/S of 2, 3 and 5, WIX's expected market cap range at FY'2021 would be between $1.89bn and $4.72bn. However, these are extremely conservative figures and I would expect WIX to have reached a billion in revenue by FY'2020. Indeed, the recent acquisition of DeviantArt creates the potential for increased revenue growth. WIX would be able to provide its web development platform and e-commerce solutions to the DeviantArt community of over 40mn.Part III: The Bear CaseThe market for web development and e-commerce platforms is incredibly saturated as there are over 20 different competing platforms, including Squarespace, Weebly, Shopify and WordPress. This could lead to commodification of this industry's solutions, driving subscription costs lower.Source: Google TrendsFurther, while WIX is one of the leading platforms due to its freemium business model. It has had to spend heavily on marketing. Selling and marketing costs for FY'2016 were $151mn up 30% from the previous year. WIX is set to spend 40% of projected revenue on marketing and has earmarked $150 million for high profile campaigns including Super Bowl ads. Such heavy marketing will weigh down on potential earnings into the long term and can only be controlled after WIX owns significant market share in a more mature market that is hostile to new entrants.While we missed out on WIX's stock price gains post earnings release, we have built up a significant position for a solid long-term hold."
4021967,102421,2016-11-10T06:37:38-05:00,The tech sector is showing many similarities to the nineties dot-com bubble.Wix.com's quality of earnings are poor.GOOG and GDDY have seen large draw-downs after providing conservative guidance.,"I survived the dot-com bubble as a CPA practicing in San Francisco. It was electric in the City back then… until it wasn't. The Fed pricked the bubble. Before they raised rates, everyone in the City thought of him as God. After, these same people, paper millionaires, watched their fortunes die in the matter of months. I see a similar situation setting up in today's go-go technology sector, and believe a short selling opportunity exists in a firm called Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX).Wix.com provides a software platform for small businesses to operate online. Through free and premium subscriptions, the Wix Editor and highly curated App Market enable users to build and manage a fully integrated and dynamic digital presence (Information gathered from Wix.com Investor Relations Website on November 9, 2016). In addition, the firm launched the Wix ADI last quarter. Artificial Design Intelligence allows access to more stylized, yet automated websites. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, their website designs are highly adaptable to mobile interface.The company Headquarters is located in Tel Aviv, Israel. Avishai Abrahami, Co-founder and CEO of Wix stated in the Second Quarter Shareholder Update that:And the report further provides these highlights:Admittedly, these are all very impressive. One tiny problem, though, the company does not make any money. I am aware that tech companies don't have to make money if the future earnings capacity is strong enough to support the valuation. I am also aware that the third quarter has a chance to be very good. Lior Shemesh, CFO of Wix, commented in the Second Quarter Earnings Release that, ""As a result [of strong performance], we are once again increasing our full year outlook for all of our key financial metrics.""Is Wix.com really a firm that is generating positive cash flow amidst negative earnings. From the Second Quarter earnings report, Avishai Abrahami, said ""Free cash flow improved to $10.2 million compared to $3.4 million for the second quarter of 2015.""He's using an appeal to authority in order to sway opinion. The appeal he makes is based on the investor's regard for ""Free Cash Flow,"" but in a tech software company, this metric is not useful to informed decision makers, unless they (A) pay dividends or (B) have substantial capital investments. A study of the statement of cash flows will show that, but first let's consider Free Cash Flow for a moment.Kieso, Kemmel & Weygandt define it in Managerial Accounting, 7e as ""the cash remaining from operations after adjustment for capital expenditures and dividends."" Accounting for high-tech firms allows every investment-type expenditure to go through the income statement as R&D expense, so there is nothing helpful from knowing the Free Cash Flow. Mr. Abrahami would be more authentic to provide the Cash Flow from Operations as that amount does not include capital investments or dividends, which Wix has not.He wanted to put a positive spin on the firm, I get it. Looking closely at the financial statements of this firm will show that they are generating positive cash flow through stock-based incentive options. In other words, his rhetoric does not fit nicely with the fact that any positive cash flow they currently generate is coming from incurrence of future obligations to the employees.If you back out the adjustment for the Cash Provided by Operating Activities to the Share-Based Compensation this firm would not be cash flow positive. Back in the day, I always advised my clients to execute a same day sale on their stock options once they've vested. I still do because these firms promise you everything yet very few deliver on their promises.The second point of my short thesis is that comparable results are not favorable in the tech sector at this moment in time. Based on the results from GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) for the Second Quarter, a narrow beat and less than stellar guidance will punish the stock:(Source: Seeking Alpha Website)If that isn't enough, consider the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) earnings report for the most recent quarter. Specifically, investors were cautious after the results showed that the relationship in the Aggregate Paid Clicks (APC, or Revenue) and the Cost Per Click (Cost per Click, or Expense) is inverting. I've compiled the data in this graph:(Data from Alphabet website)The best explanation for this comes from Rebecca Muir, a Tech Journalist, in her article titled Google: Click Volume Rises, CPC Falls. She thinks that Google is paying less for their members' advertising because there is simply more value from media websites like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram. Small businesses need Google search to be working for them, and this graph I prepared shows that it is not.Going back to the dot com bubble now, because as a survivor from the fall-out I wanted to draw out some similarities of this firm and management team to what we've learned from back then. I've pointed out some comps that do not support the firm's third quarter guidance. The former point I made suggests the tone from the top of Wix is arrogant and cavalier, and the latter point gives evidence of a slowing sector.Combined, these should be considered for a short selling opportunity into earnings on November 10th. Further, the short position could be maintained until the investor presentation at the UBS conference in San Francisco on November 15th. I would also not be surprised if the firm re-traced its chart back to the lows of last year, below $20, or a fifty percent drawdown from today's levels."

In the highly fragmented and inefficient DIY marketplace, Wix continues to grow at a strong pace with a strong product pipeline. While investors focus on churn and discount its signup pipeline, I believe that continued execution by the company would set the stage for a revaluation and drive the stock up.Business Overview: Wix.com is the creator of websites that allows users to create websites without the knowledge of writing code or design using pre-existing templates through a drag and drop functionality.A subscription business model in playCompetitive Moats: The business runs on an annual/monthly subscription model and has strong competitive moats:Annuity income streams: Customers using Wix are all subscribers, paying a fee of $9-10 a month High marketing efficiency: 13x (and counting!) returns on marketing spend in under 24 quarters. Moreover, SEO and free channels power over 50% of Wix's customer acquisition. High switching costs: Practically impossible for people to move from Wix to another rival by exporting their data. High operating leverage: As of Q4 2015, Wix has zero sales employees. The model offers an incredible operating leverage through its dominance of SEO and other free marketing channels.Other interesting updates from the business:Improving retention through subscription change into annual plans from 66% in Q1 2014 to 81% in Q4 2015. Improved growth through penetration into international markets: does not show up due to strengthening dollar. Higher ARPU from a vertical focused strategy: Wix Hotels, Wix Music, Wix Restaurants launched.Wix is an execution machine: my conversations with its marketing and tech leads has convinced me that it has one of the most efficient and focused teams, something that shows in its results: the sector mostly acts as a catch-up to Wix's product launches. It is currently growing by over 40% YoY and adding ~140,000 subscribers every quarter. Its subscriber base has now swelled to 1.65M subscribers.What's the market missing?My proprietary work indicates that Wix has far stronger market position than what the market/sell side believes: Market is underestimating what's happening at Wix by clubbing it with other consumer software businesses, even though its moats are far superior and its subscription numbers and effective churn is comparable to a typical SaaS business.Lead in free registrations: I worked with an engineer to scrape all known subdomains for Wix and Squarespace to quantify its lead over rival Squarespace. We find the gap is ~6x: much bigger than market's assumptions.Initial Conversions - Conversions from free registrations to paid subs happens after initial marketing spend over multiple quartersWhat this means is that if tomorrow Wix stopped acquiring new customers via marketing channels, their existing free pipeline will act as a ""tree that continues giving.""Organic search leads: Moreover, by tapping some of the top search volume keywords in Google Adwords and identifying the top ranking domains, we find that Wix enjoys a strong lead over its rivals, an approx. 4x differential with Squarespace in visibility. More importantly, we believe that moat is defensible: Analysis using Ahrefs, SEMRush, Searchmetrics and web search scraping indicates that the Wix has much stronger domain authority and a backlink profile that gives it a competitive advantage in exploiting SEO. This SEO lead means that Wix can acquire subscribers at a low blended cost and outspend rivals to maintain its lead in new customer acquisition. I estimate a 5.5x differential in back link profile versus Squarespace. This difference cannot be overcome with additional funding or in a short span of time.ValuationA. Relative Comps: Wix lacks good public comps for comparison. The Street's comp set is service-focused businesses like Web.com that are low growth and offer a fundamentally different low margin, low leverage product. For example, Web.com continues to offer a ""Do it for me"" product that's a relatively high touch service business. A relatively better comparable is Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) that trades at ~11x 2016E revenues vs. Wix's ~2.7x 2016E comp.True competitors exist in private market but are at a much higher multiple than Wix:A reversion to trendline implies 2.5x growth in market capI'd argue that Wix exhibits the characteristics of a good SaaS business, but trades at a discount relative to the SaaS universe. Saas businesses trade on revenue growth as they are in a heavy growth phase. Wix too is incredibly similar, but trades at a discount despite its strong growth.B. DCF: My 18-month price target for shares of Wix is $32. I have modeled FCFF, assumed a modest growth in FCFF and then applied a LT growth rate of 4%. A sensitivity analysis shows our assumptions to be highly robust with a good margin of safety.Discussion on WACC Assumption: As per Bloomberg, the WACC of the company is estimated at 6.2%, which implies a very low beta. However, I believe that the volatility of the stock should increase and taking a very cautious stance I have used a WACC of 11% to value the company. Note that using the Bloomberg derived WACC of 6.2% would significantly increase the target price.C/Liquidation Value: We extrapolate subscriber cohort retention metrics using a shifted beta geometric model (refer Bruce Hardie and Peter Fader's research) to calculate residual LTV. This implies expected PV of revenues of $734M IF the company completely stops spending on S&M/R&D and relies on its existing subscriber base for revenues. With $92M in cash and short-term assets, this falls short of the market cap by just 15%.In short, Wix trades at a price that's at a small premium than its subscriber liquidation value if we account for H1 2016 signups.Multiple catalysts could trigger a price revaluationImprovement in ARPU metrics faster than what Street expects: After speaking with the Wix team, we find that they are much more focused on improving ARPU instead of user growth, which has been the key focus area in the past. I find this context missing in sell side research. As Wix continues to grow, the gap between its intrinsic valuation and market value will widen if ARPU growth is higher than Street expectation, triggering a multiple revaluation.Move into other niche areas: Wix's move into other niche areas doesn't fully get reflected in the stock price; its App products could open a whole new market for the company.Funding squeeze in private markets could act as a potential tailwind: As the late stage private markets turn sour, Wix could be poised to exploit this opportunity. Wix's direct competitors are all private companies (Weebly, Squarespace) and competing with Wix can become very challenging. This might mean:Risks:Slowing growth: The underlying assumption in the Wix story is the ability to maintain strong growth numbers. Wix might see its growth slow down, thereby negatively impacting its stock price.Negative EBITDA: Due to its aggressive spend on growth, Wix has a negative EBITDA. Although guidance remains positive, markets may start giving more credit to margins over growth impacting Wix's stock price.Aggressive Growth Marketing Team: Some of the Wix aggressive ""tricks"" are known in the growth community and could result in being penalized by Google. This might increase acquisition costs as 50% of customers are currently acquired via organic search.Country Risks: Operations in Israel and ~40% revenues ex-US, so forex risks exist as costs are in Israeli Shekel while revenues are in US DollarsWix's employee base is young: they could be called for military service in case of a conflict.(Editors' Note: This is a republication of an entry in the Sohn Investment Idea Contest. All figures are current as of the entry's submission - the contest deadline was April 22, 2016)."

The company is headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel. It also has offices in the U.S., Brazil, and Eastern Europe.Introduction: Development of Website Building IndustryWix is a company that specializes in providing technology over the Internet for people to build their own websites. It wasn't too long ago that if a business owner wanted a website, he or she had to pay a web designer a few thousand dollars to build one for them or do it themselves after buying expensive software and committing a considerable amount of time to learn basic HTML and CSS coding. I started my business in 2010 and did the latter. At the time, I had never even heard of Wix or any of its competitors. WYSISWYG (What You See Is What You Get), drag and drop, website building software was in its infancy.Now, less than six years later, there is an established industry of cloud-based (i.e., through a web browser and no software download needed), do-it-yourself website building providers. Wix is the only one that is a publicly-traded company. Its top competitors are Squarespace, Weebly, and WordPress. With relatively little barriers to entry, there are many other smaller players. The overall industry is still very fragmented. There are countless websites evaluating and comparing the services of these main players.Wix also competes with independent website designers, many of whom use Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) sophisticated Dreamweaver application or the open source WordPress technology. These independent designers tend to cater to companies with larger budgets. Lastly, it also competes more indirectly with web hosting companies like GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY). Because companies like Wix offer free hosting with even their most basic paid service, companies that used to just specialize in web hosting have had to start offering website building applications in order to survive. This is what happened with my hosting company, MacHighway. It now offers package plans that include Weebly's site builder.As you can see, the website building industry has come a long way in a short amount of time. It is no coincidence that I have emphasized this in my introduction. We will touch on the importance of this later.Priced to PerfectionMost readers are aware that high-growth technology stocks typically have a strong dose of hypothetical future earnings growth priced into them at any given point. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the quintessential example. For investors to ultimately get a good return on their investment, the companies have to keep the growth going at a relatively high rate. Investors realize that the rate of growth will eventually slow down, but they expect the share price to eventually be much higher along that ultimate glide path.This is currently the case with Wix. I estimate that its current share price reflects a good value for earnings about three years out (2018) and free cash flow about two years out (2017) under what I would call the best-case scenario. First, let us take a detailed look at this best-case scenario.The following chart incorporates historical revenue (or net sales) and collections for Wix and projects them forward through 2018 based upon my estimates derived from a continuation of their underlying growth trend (Collections is a non-GAAP measure used by the company that refers to the amount of cash collected by customers in a given period. It is calculated by taking revenues + change in deferred revenues. Deferred revenue is cash received from customers that is not yet recognized as revenue).The following table shows what the historical annual growth rates for collections and revenue were and what they would be from 2016 to 2018 to achieve the targets on the previous chart:As shown in this table, this model assumes that annual growth rates will continue to slow down over the next three years as the market steadily matures.These growth rates were derived from the estimates on the following table of how many premium subscribers (i.e., paying customers) Wix will have and the assumption that its collections per subscriber will flat line going forward (some historical figures are also included for perspective):There are two reasons why I am projecting that collections per subscriber will, at best, flat line. Here they are in order of importance:1. Collections per subscriber peaked in the fourth quarter of 2013 and have been declining ever since then. The following chart shows the quarterly trend of the annualized collections per premium subscriber calculated by taking the collections for each quarter x 4 and dividing by the number of premium subscribers from the prior quarter (My thinking here was that the collections for a quarter are best measured against the number of premium subscribers at the end of the previous quarter).(Note: Q4 2015 is an estimate).2. I think the quarterly decline in collections per subscriber is a reflection of a maturing market with increased price competition. Squarespace, Weebly, and WordPress all have comparable pricing to Wix. Wix has been discounting to lure registered users into premium subscriptions.The company's management has laid out the following targets for its business model (each based on percentage of collections):The gross margin, sales & marketing, and G&A targets look achievable by 2018. Based on current trends though, there is no way it will come even close to the R&D target anytime soon without making considerable sacrifices to the key source of its future innovation. Wix would have to spend less on R&D in 2018 than it is spending now to reach its target. For the purpose of my estimates, I assume that the company meets all these expense targets by 2018, except for R&D which I estimate at 26%.Here are my earnings estimates for the next three years:Also, I should note that these estimates assume the following:Again, these estimates reveal my best-case scenario for Wix where it would reach a trailing 12-month (""TTM"") multiple in the mid-20s by the end of 2018.Sooner or Later... There Will Be Something For The Bear To EatThe next three years for Wix are not going to be the same as the last three. I see several potential disruptions to the company achieving the optimal scenario laid out in the previous section. I will list them in what I think are the order of importance.1. Technological Advancement of the Internet Requires Greater R&D SpendJust over the last seven-year economic/market cycle (2008 to 2014), website designs have changed dramatically. If there is any guarantee for Wix's future, it is that it will continually face increased competition from new technology. To hold, let alone gain, market share, the company will need to continue to innovate and remain at the forefront of essential web design technology. Websites are now the storefront or newspaper front page (via blogs) for many of their customers. If a competitor has something better, people will be tempted to switch. Furthermore, there is a certain edge that business owners and writers can maintain in their respective marketplace by refreshing their web presence periodically.Wix's target for R&D expense could prove to be very unrealistic when it comes to what is required for remaining competitive. My own personal example is relevant here. About a year ago, I built the latest version of my advisory business website truevineinvestments.com using Adobe Dreamweaver's fluid grid layout that enabled me to build a mobile responsive website. Prior to deciding to ""do it myself"" (again) I looked into Squarespace and Wix. I recall thinking at the time that Wix's templates were unappealing. Not too long after that though, the company launched a new editor and more appealing template designs. The year prior to these major upgrades (2014) saw R&D spending of 41% of revenue/34% of collections. This ratio could obviously come down as the company adds more users, but I think management's targets are way, way out there. The rapid technological advancement of the Internet is such that a steady stream of R&D spending is required to remain competitive.2. Wix's Restrictions Could Lead To The Loss Of More Premium SubscribersI have developed several of my own websites so I have a good deal of expertise on how Wix's industry works. In preparation for this article, I devoted a significant amount of time to reading subscriber commentary and reviews of Wix on the Internet. Because of the nature of the business, there is a ton of information available on the nuts and bolts of Wix and its competitors.There are a lot of small business owners, like me, that initially built their own website or paid an independent developer to do it for them. With the rise of template based, do-it-yourself services like Wix, many have been ""trying"" such services over the last several years. This helps explain the solid growth of Wix's subscriber base. The refresh cycle is now coming again for many of these business owners who are now more experienced with websites and more savvy about what they need.There are several, very important technical reasons why many premium subscribers have already, or may soon decide, left Wix behind. Here they are in no order of importance:(1) Mobile DesignWhen I built the last version of my website, I knew I had to have a mobile-friendly site. Not just because it helps your Google search rankings, but because many people now are using mobile devices for their primary computing and not desktop computers (Seeking Alpha contributors know exactly what I am talking about). Personally, I find it relaxing to read articles on my iPhone while laying in bed at night. I wanted to ensure others could do the same on my websites.Dreamweaver's fluid grid layouts allowed me to essentially design the site with a ""mobile first perspective."" In other words, I could easily design the site to look and function good on a mobile phone and it would automatically do the same for tablets and desktop computers. This is commonly referred to as ""responsive"" design. If you are designing a site and later maintaining it frequently (adding content, etc.), you do not want to have to constantly tweak the mobile version of the site. Furthermore, companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Samsung (OTC:SSNNF) keep throwing all sorts of different sized phones and tablets into the market. You want your website to look good and function properly on every single different sized device.Apparently, the Wix editor is designed to primarily build websites for desktop computers and then a mobile editor is used to ""tweak"" them for mobile. This was fine in 2010, but not now, and certainly not in 2018. In a detailed blog post titled, ""Why I Left Wix for Squarespace,"" a photographer mentions the following regarding Squarespace:He was referring to the fact that he had to constantly tweak the mobile version of his site when he was using Wix. In the post, he goes on to describe all sorts of issues he had with his images looking right on different sized screens (link above for those interested in reading more).(2) Limitations of TemplatesWhen a Wix subscriber designs a website, they have to pick from one of the many templates offered by the company (The abundant use of templates are why so many websites now look the same). Apparently, users cannot switch templates with their content. This is a major setback. For example, say you built your site in 2014 and want to refresh it in 2016 with a new look. Guess what, you have to build it all over again! With Squarespace, users can simply switch templates and their content carries over. I found the following comparison review of Wix and Squarespace to be very good. It mentions this limitation.(3) Search Engine Optimization (""SEO"")SEO refers to the proper building of a website so that it can be found on Internet search engines. I found a significant volume of complaints on the Internet about problems with Wix's SEO, including right on the company's support page. I am sure that not all the negativity is justified, however, there is so much of it out there that it may very well be discouraging sales to new users. Wix's SEO limitations are also commonly referred to on review blogs.(4) Users Do Not Control Their DataUsers who build sites with Wix cannot access the code to make any changes. More importantly, if they decide to leave Wix, they cannot take it with them. If the company ever has a severe interruption of service, such as from being hacked, users would have to rebuild their entire website elsewhere. Conversely, Squarespace users and independent designers like myself can take their code with them. If my web host was destroyed, I could upload all the code for my site (because I control it all) with another host very quickly. This should be particularly concerning for Wix's shareholders, especially after reading the following statement in its 2014 20-F:If you are a small business using a Wix-built website to make all your sales online, the time it would take to rebuild elsewhere could be devastating to your business. If more Wix users get a whiff of this risk, this could mean more lost subscriptions.Moreover, I see this as a potential impediment to Wix's strategy of building an integrated ecosystem, including CRM, etc., for business owners. Putting all this together, I suspect that the company is going to be facing an increase in lost premium subscribers in the near term.3. Technological DisruptionA few months back, I wrote a brief article on Seeking Alpha about The Grid. The team of individuals behind it are attempting to use artificial intelligence (""AI"") to build websites. All users have to do is add content, pictures, etc. and steer it in their preferred design direction. Here is an example of a site about Bitcoin that was recently built with The Grid. This is no doubt easier said than done. I was convinced enough last year though to sign up (and prepay a $96 annual subscription) to become one of about 65,000 founding members. The beta platform for The Grid is now being rolled out to the founding members at a pace of about 200 more per day. I should have access in a few months, and I am near the end of the line, so in another year or so we should start to get a good idea of how viable this potential technology could become. If the essential promise is fulfilled, then it could take off and become a severe disruption to the industry. Such an occurrence could also lure one of the big boys like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) into competing. Conversely though, if Wix can introduce new disrupting technologies, then its growth could accelerate further.4. International Growth StrategyThe hallmark of Wix's growth strategy has been international expansion. In 2010, the company derived 71% of its revenue from North America. During the third quarter of 2015, only 48% of revenue came from North America. As I inspected its geographic revenue growth further, I noticed that the pace of North American revenue growth is slowing substantially. North American revenues grew by 66.5% in 2014, but only by 36.5% in 2015. Wix faces intense competition in the U.S., and I think this is a signal that the industry is quickly heading to an early level of maturity.Almost two-thirds of Wix's revenue growth in 2015 came from outside North America. This is fine over the longer term, but the immediate trend of a rising U.S. dollar is going to continue to be a revenue headwind. The following chart reveals the trend of the dollar:Real Trade Weighted US Dollar Index: Major Currencies data by YChartsAs the dollar continues to climb, Wix's foreign revenues, translated back into U.S. dollars, will continue to shrink. That being said, it does have about 1/3 of its expenses denominated in Israeli shekels. The shekel has been falling against the dollar, so this has helped the company absorb some of the rising dollar headwind.Expansion into emerging markets may also require Wix to price its service lower, so it is more affordable for small businesses in those countries. The company mentions this as a potential risk in its 20-F filing. Because Wix's revenue base is becoming increasingly concentrated outside of the U.S., this could be a reason why collections per premium subscriber (measured quarterly, as shown on the red chart above) have been declining.Wix's international operations also bring other noteworthy challenges and risks along with it. Examples include the (1) need to create different and more complex business processes in various countries to receive customer payments (many emerging market users don't have credit cards) and (2) regulations, such as those being considered in the European Union, that may require technology companies to physically house all customer data in each specific country. Such complications and regulations may hinder Wix's margins as its international footprint continues to accelerate. At the very least, it will likely add a degree of volatility to its earnings.Modelling a Negative OutcomeFrom a risk/reward perspective, I see the risks as heavily skewed to the downside. In other words, those taking a short position have little to lose at the current price and potentially a lot to gain. I feel it is almost as if a short can just take their position and let the ""law"" of constant technological change and increased Internet complexity do the work.The market is looking at Wix's nice and pretty stair-stepped trend of increased premium subscribers with little understanding of the underlying demands of website building and little appreciation for the potential impact of competitive threats (both internally, margin wise, and externally through the direct loss of customers).I gave you what I think is the best-case scenario for Wix's revenue growth and profitability over the next three years. What will happen if the growth trend starts to deteriorate faster or the company cannot bring down costs as fast as it has projected? I ran some potential scenarios and, let me just say, it doesn't take much for the bottom line to be wiped out quickly. If Wix's revenue growth only increases by 24% in 2016, 21% in 2017, and 15% in 2018 (down from my best case of 29% in 2016, 21% in 2017, and 15% in 2018), then the company would still have negative operating income in 2018 (assuming the same level of expenses). This scenario alone would likely devastate the share price, especially given the fact that I am expecting a bear market in stocks to intensify in 2018.Strategy For ShortingAccording to Interactive Brokers, Wix had 995,066 shortable shares on January 27, 2016. Also, 4% of Wix's outstanding shares were short (861,000) with 5.92 days to cover, based on average trading volumes. Interactive Brokers' borrowing fee rate is only .94%.Before going further, it is important that readers have some perspective on the historical price range of the stock. The following chart provides that:WIX data by YChartsWix trades on the NASDAQ. After a big drop during the third quarter of 2015 - from $28 down to $18 per share - the stock's performance has paralleled the broader index, as shown here:WIX data by YChartsTo execute a short sale of Wix, a little patience is needed. The company releases its fourth-quarter 2015 earnings on February 11, 2016, and I am not anticipating any major surprises to drag the stock down right away. More likely, it will show reasonable subscriber growth, and the market will hold to the same growth story. Any underlying deterioration of its operating fundamentals will likely go unnoticed. I am also expecting the broader U.S. stock market to experience a strong rebound over the next few months, the tide of which would also likely lift the Wix boat. After this period is when the Wix short opportunity will come to fruition.To be specific, anywhere above $25 per share is a good entry point in the near term. I do not expect the stock to breach its December 2015 high of $25.52. Since the company went public, the stock has been putting in a series of lower highs, but has been basing its lows around $17.50. At a minimum, I think the stock will at least return to this base. A return to the base presents about 15% upside. However, I expect one or more of my bear impacts to begin hitting the stock this year. The market will wake up to the fact that Wix's business faces intense technological and competitive demands and the rosy growth story will begin to come into question. I think the more likely outcome is that the $17.50 base will break and the stock will be facing the $10 to $15 trading range by late 2017.Short sellers could take one of two different approaches. The first would be to take a position now (e.g., 50% of the desired total position) and leave some dry powder in case the stock climbs back to $25. The second would be to hold out entirely and wait for a better entry point. I prefer the latter approach, because I am bullish on the broader market near term. Traders who disagree with me and are more bearish may prefer the former approach.ConclusionThe competitive environment for website development is intense and fraught with land mines that the market does not see or understand. 2016 will be the year that the market wakes up to the fact that the Wix growth story is not as smooth as expected. The post-IPO honeymoon for the company is about to come to an abrupt end. Depending upon the intensity of the various bearish headwinds for Wix, there could be considerable downside for the stock over the next year or two as the market adjusts.Important Regulatory DisclosuresI am a Registered Investment Advisor in the State of Pennsylvania.

3979767,61873,2016-06-03T15:25:59-04:00,It could take a long time for Wix to grow into its current high valuation.Wix needs to constantly spend on new features and services in order to keep up with the competition.Wix is an expensive stock with a product that is not superior to the competition.Based on my personal experience I have found Wordpress to be a better platform.,"In this article I would like to share my experience as a client of Wix and what conclusions I reached regarding the stock. I was with Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) since 2012. I decided to setup a website mainly for family and friends who knew me and want to follow along with my investment strategy. I decided to try out Wix because the full version was free and if I liked it I could pay to get rid of the ads and use a domain of my choosing. FYI, you don't need a domain or pretty much anything when going with Wix because they will give you an address based on your account name (eg. lastname.wix.com/yoursitename). As you see below, Wix is quite popular.(Source: Wix Investor Relations)This is a fantastic marketing strategy because you end up dedicating time to put the site together. As a result, when you decide to take the next step then more than likely you will become a Wix client. Wix is easy to use with a drag and drop system. Over time it has become a little more complicated but I consider it to be quite intuitive.(Source: Wix Investor Relations)After designing the website in flash, I had to pretty much start over if I wanted to move to HTML5. And I really had no option as the flash site would not work on all devices. Wix provided a ""convert"" option but was little help. The HTML5 site at the time had few options but I was still happy with the product. As I added content and pages, I discovered I wanted to do more and more. Unfortunately, a lot of the features I wanted were not available and many quick fixes suggested were just not satisfactory to me.I stuck with it though as I liked the design options and Wix kept adding more options and items. For example the galleries have a rich set of options under the following four categories: slider galleries, grid galleries, full-width galleries, and 3D galleries. There are 46 different gallery options!I found the implementation problematic. As I tried out different galleries, I discovered they visually didn't turn out as nicely as I would have liked and it appeared that the monitor or browser also affected the result. When I finally found something I liked and which worked, I discovered that it didn't look so good on mobile devices. This I believe is a huge disadvantage of Wix. You basically have to switch views from desktop to mobile and edit your design there as well. In other words Wix is not responsive. In a responsive design (such as offered under Wordpress) you make the change once and it looks great everywhere without any need to change anything. As I result, every time I made a change in Wix, I would also have to look at the mobile view and make changes there as well. For example, I would have to change the font or move things around. It was very tedious.Over the past year I asked a friend to take a look at my website and help me improve it. She noticed even more problems. For example, when clicking through the pages, the alignment or fonts need tweaking. This is the beauty of a Wordpress website, which as you understand, I switched to. The theme pretty much takes care of all these issues automatically as design and content are separate while in Wix it's all integrated together.I finally gave up a few months ago when I decided to add ads to my website. I applied to Google Adsense, and was rejected due to insufficient content. This didn't make sense to me as there was content. So I googled the problem and found that I wasn't on my own. There were a lot of people on the Wix forums looking for a solution and the reply given by Wix support was not helpful at all. Most of the time it was the same copy/paste response! I was paying EUR 177 a year for this torture and I had had enough. I was sick of looking up workarounds for Wix problems. In case you were wondering, my Wordpress site was approved by Google Adsense within hours! And in a few days the final review was completed and ads are now displayed.For those unfamiliar with Wordpress there is a Wordpress.com and Wordpress.org. For maximum flexibility users go to .org (to see the differences look here). Basically with .org you need to find a host and do the maintenance work but you can install plugins, custom themes, etc. I went with Bluehost (recommended by Wordpress) which would cost me EUR 42 for the first year. Plus when I transferred my domains from Wix to Bluehost they renewed it for free. More importantly, I had direct access to real people at Bluehost via live chat. There was a bit of waiting but the Bluehost staff were excellent. They helped make the transition as easy as possible.On setting up my new Wordpress website I decided to purchase a theme for USD 99 and went with Genesis framework and a child theme. Basically all the changes you do are on the ""child"" theme and Genesis is the backbone. This approach is recommended because when Wordpress updates their software some of the free themes have issues. Apologies if this sounds complicated, but its much simpler than it sounds. Studiopress (Genesis creator) has a setup page for the theme I bought and basically I learned how to use Wordpress by following the Studiopress instructions. Furthermore I would like to point out that there are several companies that offer a variety of themes that make the process much simpler for beginners. For example there are even drag and drop builders but I can't comment on them as I haven't used them.Wordpress differs from Wix in its approach. There is the dashboard on which you have access to both design and content but they are essentially two separate things. As a result a design change can be implemented easily. You can go as far as switching themes and the posts and pages are now in the new theme. In Wix the content is in the theme so if you want to change it, you have to re-design the site from scratch.Wordpress offers superior flexibility and support. There are so many people using Wordpress that a simple google search will lead you to the answer. I was shocked at how fast I found answers. If I wanted to do something on the site there was already someone else out there who had also wanted to do the same and the answer was there. Plugins work like the Wix App Market, however in Wordpress there are significantly more and better options. Furthermore you can find a free plugin or the basic version of a plugin and don't need to buy the pro version. In Wix, I found the basic/free version of apps to be useless. As a I result I can conclude that Wordpress plugins are far superior. (It reminds me of Windows mobile apps vs Apple App Store Apps). Finally, my website was no longer hostage, and I have the option of changing the design or moving it to a different host any time I want. The website is now truly mine.So where am I going with this? The above is my story as a loyal Wix customer who switched to Wordpress because Wix has limitations and what is marketed as an easy to use platform results in many lost hours trying to get what you want to work and look good. This has implications for Wix's model. As we see below, Wix is not profitable.(Source: Wix Investor Relations)While Wix has had impressive revenue growth, it is still losing money. Even adjusted EBITDA turns negative when we include stock based compensation. Stock based compensation has been rising as shown below. If we annualize 1Q16 then this expense will reach $24m vs $19M in 2015. Company guidance for full-year 2016 adjusted EBITDA is $30-32m. If we removed the stock based compensation that becomes $6-8m. Even with the company's adjusted value, the stock is trading at over 30x EV/EBITDA. P/S is a bit better at 3x guidance. Analysts expect Wix to be loss-making in both 2016 and 2017 with estimated EPS of -49c and -2c respectively. (Note that analysts estimates are usually non-gaap so they are not conservative...)The problem that I see with Wix is their target model which is shown below. Over the last two years the company has more than doubled revenues but these cost haven't changed much. So it could be a while before these targets are reached...(Source: Wix Investor Relations)Below is the output from Google Trends which shows Wordpress in the lead, followed by Wix. From this chart we see that Joomla's popularity has dropped significantly.(Source: google.com/trends)So over the next few years I wouldn't be surprised to see other firms go Joomla's way. We could have a new market leader or additional competition. But having seen the power of Wordpress, its following and abundant support, they will be difficult to displace. The one thing that is for sure is that Wix needs to continue spending in order to keep improving its platform.The company could very well be loss-making for a while and plans to reduce costs may take longer. At the same time, there is a risk that other customers like myself walk away and use other platforms. (Note that when I type in google ""switch from wix to wordpress"" I get over 500 results while ""switch from wordpress to wix"" results in only 7 results). Overall for a product that may fail and is not superior to its competition, the stock is richly priced. I believe investors should stay away."
3948176,98656,2016-03-02T12:10:24-05:00,"Small businesses have grown again in February. We see this as a great sign for Wix.com.By providing website and e-commerce solutions, we feel Wix could benefit from this sustained increase in small business growth.Around 70% of small to medium-sized businesses still don't have a website. This gives the company a huge amount of growth potential.The company grew its premium user count by a massive 43% year over year.","Following reports that the IHS Small Business Jobs Index has expanded again in February, we feel now could be a good time to look at an investment in a company we feel could be benefiting from this continued rise. The company in question is Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX).As you can see on the chart below, there has been a sustained uptick in small business growth in the last few months following an overwhelming run of declines since the start of 2014. With lots of small businesses growing and/or starting up, certain needs will have to be met, and we believe that Wix.com can provide solutions to a number of these needs.Source: Paychex IHS Small Business Jobs IndexWix.com provides a cloud-based web development platform which allows its users to easily create web sites and mobile sites or use pre-designed templates for personal or business use. One of the first things you need when you start a business is some form of online presence. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) are great for this, but we see them as more of a complement to a website rather than being a business' home page.According to its recent presentation, 70% of small to medium-sized businesses do not have a website, and of those that do, 70% do not have mobile optimization. The reason most businesses give for not having a website is that it is too difficult setting one up. This is where Wix steps up to the plate.Whether you're selling something or promoting your services, Wix is able to help every step of the way. We've trialed the service and find the creation of websites to be quite easy, and the template designs on offer to be very appealing.The plans are competitive and its e-commerce plan comes in at $24.90 monthly, or $194 if paid annually. Compared with competitor Shopify (NYSE:SHOP), this is significantly cheaper. Now, we do feel that Shopify offers a better e-commerce platform, but when you are starting a business money can be tight, so we feel there will be a lot of people opting for a value option initially.Source: Wix.comAbove you can see a sample of the free templates that the company provides users. We think the free offerings are of a very high standard and a great way of bringing in customers. Although they offer these services free, the company has the opportunity to upsell services to them to enhance the experience. It's a great way of gaining subscribers. In its recent presentation the company stated that approximately 50% of its subscribers come via free traffic sources.The numbers that management has released are very impressive in our opinion and can be seen on the chart below. With 77 million registered users, up around 33% year over year, the company's growth has been explosive. Its premium user growth was just as explosive, too, with a year-over-year gain of approximately 43%, to 1.77 million. This helped increase revenue by 43.5% to $203.5 million.Source: Wix PresentationThe key for continued revenue growth, beyond an increase in users, is the company's app market. Through its app market it can introduce apps with the potential to generate revenue streams which could significantly boost the company's top line. Wix Bookings is one such app that we especially like. We see this app as being a great way to convert free users into premium users. The app quite simply allows bookings to be made on its users' websites. We think this will attract businesses ranging from restaurants to beauticians into using Wix's services, and in order to accept payments they'll need to upgrade to a premium package.Due to the growth in small businesses, together with its growing reputation and user count, we believe the company will continue to grow its premium users and revenue at similarly high rates in 2016. We expect revenue to come in at $275 million in fiscal 2016, which is an increase of 35% year over year.In terms of valuation, we see a price-to-sales ratio of around 4.75 being more than fair. This is significantly less than Shopify which is trading at 8.7 times sales at present, but considering its trading history, shown above, it is a level we feel comfortable with.Priced at 4.75 times sales, with $275 million of revenue, and an estimated 43 million shares outstanding, we have a target price for Wix of $30.38. This would be a huge return of approximately 58% from the last close price of $19.20. Although this does seem incredibly far away, it is worth pointing out that it was only six months ago that the shares were trading as high as $28.63.If Wix can continue its strong growth, we feel this incredible return will be the start of even greater returns in the future. For this reason we have taken a long position with Wix today."
3706366,70435,2015-11-23T10:10:12-05:00,Growing paid subscriptions have translated to a sharp increase in revenues.Rollout of updated design and features is improving conversion rates.Company yet to show a profit since public listing but losses are shrinking.,"Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX) has shown a positive trend following a third quarter that beat analyst expectations. Revenues were up and the company's EPS also managed beat forecasts, but the company has still yet to report a profit. Since its initial public offering and subsequent drop in prices, Wix has been hard at work attempting to increase its registered users and more importantly, turning them into paying customers. So far, the company has succeeded in increasing their user numbers, but despite an increase in traffic and revenues that continue to rise, Wix must still show that it can translate those users into profits. In a technology ecosystem that is increasingly hostile to companies that cannot generate profits, Wix must prove to investors, as many successful technology providers have in the past, that increasing exposure will eventually lead to profitability.Improving FinancialsWix has shown improved growth during the previous two quarters. The company has displayed increased revenue in every quarter since the second quarter of 2014, and the third quarter of this year showed their best growth yet, with $53.28 million representing a 9% quarterly increase, and a 43% year over year jump from the same period in 2014. This beat both the company's guidance for the quarter of $52 to 53 million and analyst forecasts of $52.57 million in revenues.Other important metrics for the company have also seen strong growth in the period. The company added 140,000 new subscriptions to premium plans in the quarter, their best ever recorded results at impressive 56% year over year growth. This also coincides with growth of overall registered users, both paid and unpaid, 34% year over year to 72 million. Wix has also been fairly successful at maintaining a solid rate of active users throughout the previous quarters, and shows no sign of changing that trend.Still not thereA more worrying trend appears, however, when closely examining Wix's profits going back to its IPO in 2013. To date, Wix has not reported a profit in any quarter it has been publicly traded. In the third quarter, the company reported a net loss of $11.70 million or -$0.30 per share, as they have consistently been unable to translate high numbers of users into a sustainable business model. . This trend has been improving, though, and the company has been able to cut losses by 5% versus the second quarter and 9% on an annualized basis.Another important concern for Wix at this point is their ability to convert their 72 million users into paid customers. Ending in September, the total amount of premium users was still only 2% of all registered users. While revenue growth is certainly important, Wix will continue to struggle to turn a profit until it can cut costs further or find a way to improve the conversion rate.Moving ForwardDespite these problems, Wix seems to be on the way up. Even without profits, the company has managed to rally after an initial drop in share prices in the months following their public debut, now rallying nearly almost 34% from the most recent lows on the back of strong fundamentals and a plan that seems to account for a lack of profits. The company has been consistent in managing their growth and have even managed positive cash flow for the third quarter. This reflects a massive improvement from $-2.90 million to $5.4 million, with the company showing an increasing strong commitment to building solid financials.Wix has also been aggressive in evolving and continuing to improve their service. The company recently launched a redesign of their site and web development tools. Wix reportedly claims the new design has already paid dividends, contributing to a 15-20% increase in conversion rates for the newer premium subscriptions. They have also launched a new music-specific service, and have hired major celebrities as a way of increasing their brand awareness.The Fundamental PictureFrom a strictly fundamental point of view, value investors and income investors should go nowhere near shares of Wix. Although the company boasts an amazing user base and potential for high growth in the technology space, lack of profits is a worrisome indication for potential shareholders looking to see improved stakeholder value. Prices continue to trend well-off of this year's record highs and despite the long-view of management, shows little in the way of upside unless the company can substantially improve conversion to paid subscriptions.While the redesigned site might have seen a rapid improvement in this measure, it must be seen as a sustained trend to really translate to optimism for shareholders. Should conversion rates begin seeing increased momentum higher, it could see share prices easily overcome previous 52-week highs at $28.63 and pushing towards $30 per share, especially considering the high growth nature of the company and astounding year over year revenue growth. If the company can successfully reverse the cash burn, it will rapidly improve sentiment. Although not an ideal entry point, investors would be keen to initiate long-term positions targeting $30 on any correction that nears $20 per share.ConclusionWix has so far shown itself to be more resilient than most of its publicly traded contemporaries in the technology industry, but are not completely immune. Other major tech companies debuted on the markets with promise, only to see their hopes swiftly dashed. Companies such as Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) and Square (NYSE:SQ) have not lived up to the public offering promises flouted to investors, with shares floundering and dropping after a few months because of their inability to convert their business models from revenue and user growth to profit and monetization. However, if Wix continues to prove it is dedicated to responsible growth and is better able to realize conversions from free users to premium subscriptions, the streak of losses should come to an end sooner than later."

        The Grid is a private startup run by an impressive team of web pioneers.
        If the Grid can successfully deliver on its promise, it would be a serious competitive threat to Wix.com.","I am a small business owner with three different websites that I built myself using Adobe's (NASDAQ:ADBE) Dreamweaver software. Dreamweaver is a high-end solution used by many web design professionals. Each subsequent site build required a substantial investment of my time to learn how to do it and/or update myself on new capabilities, such as fluid grid layouts for mobile web design. I enjoyed the experience though, because it taught me a lot about how the internet and websites work. I also tried Squarespace, but I found it restrictive. I think it is a good product for the beginner, but if you know too much it can be frustrating. Ultimately though, as I move forward, I would prefer to leave Dreamweaver and use a simpler solution that integrates new web technology for me so I can just focus on what I do best. This seemed impossible until I stumbled upon The Grid.The Grid is a personal web development platform that harnesses the power of Artificial Intelligence (""AI""). The company describes it as follows:There is also a short video on the site that summarizes this unique approach. The Grid claims that its AI platform will build the website for you. You simply add your content and the AI keeps expanding and refining your website. The sites are also mobile friendly.I am convinced. I signed up to be a founding member last week. Founding members lock in an annual subscription for $96 ($8 a month) for life. Once the Grid launches, an annual subscription will cost $25 a month. The pricing looks comparative to the existing solutions I previously referenced. The Grid is looking to expand their founding members by paying existing founding members for referrals. (Full disclosure: As a founding member of the Grid, I can be compensated for referrals. However, these must be processed through a web link that is not provided in this article. Therefore, if someone visits the Grid website through this article and signs up, I will not be compensated.)The Grid is currently a private startup run by an impressive team of experienced web pioneers, such as chairman and co-founder Brian Axe who built Google's AdSense business from the ground up. At this point, there is simply a unique promise for people like myself, and a promotional website-built by the Grid-with many thought provoking details of what this promise means. If they can pull this off, it will be quite impressive indeed.The Grid currently has a little over 60,000 founding members. It is currently in beta testing and expected to launch soon for the founding members (the initial projected start date was 2015). I can't wait to try it out. If it is highly successful, it could quickly start eating into the subscriptions of the existing, template-based web development and hosting platforms offered by Squarespace, Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Web.com (WWWW), GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY), and a whole host of other smaller players. Moreover, it could really shakeup the web design industry in general.A Possible Test for Wix.comWix.com is a small capitalization growth stock that has stumbled a bit out of the gate, since it went public in 2013. It has had strong revenue growth, but is not yet profitable. However, it was free cash flow positive after the most recent quarter. The following table shows the growth progression of Wix.com's revenue, free cash flow, and net income over the last five quarters.Assuming it can bring in $10 million of net income next year, it is trading for about 80 times earnings. Also, the stock is trading for 250 times last quarter's free cash flow (annual basis). A serious competitive obstacle for Wix.com could crater the stock.ConclusionWix.com investors should keep an eye on the Grid. It is not an immediate threat, but if successful after its launch, it quickly could be. Like me on Dreamweaver, I suspect that the vast majority of Wix.com's existing subscribers would only leave town if there was a significantly more simple and cost-effective solution that delivered cutting edge technology. This is exactly what attracted me to the Grid.Important Regulatory Disclosures:I am a Registered Investment Advisor in the State of Pennsylvania.

3238876,48411,2015-06-05T10:27:19-04:00,"WIX is a buy at just ~5X E2015 sales and ~3X E2016 sales.WIX presents impressive cohort data that show that it should be on the front end of a massive run.WIX is also one of three ""superpowers"" in the creation engine niche that should benefit form the continued ""move"" online and the content creation craze.WIX has a great model that should be Adjusted EBITDA positive on the full year.Buy WIX.","Let's talk about Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX) because I love WIX, I love what it's doing, what it is, what it represents, and I love that I love it and I think it can be wildly lucrative. In fact, I think WIX is really, really, cheap and on the front end of a major inflection point that will have it never looking back.Now, with all the technology names the first question you should be asking yourself is ""is this differentiated"" followed immediately by ""is this defensible"" and the answer to both for WIX is largely, no. Which is surprising, right? Maybe not surprising that what essentially boils down to as a website development engine isn't differentiated and defensible but that I would still love it as an investment.So why do I? Well, for me, WIX's biggest asset is that it was a first mover in the space (along with WordPress - owned by Automatic, and Squarespace) and that it has a huge base of users. These users, which take quite a bit of time (at least they did) to acquire, have proven out to be more and more profitable with time and retention. WIX provides a cohort case study for its Q1/2010 acquired users in its 20-F filing that shows that it has turned a ~12X return on investment from this group. That's right, 12X.Think about that. As WIX is still growing at absurd rates, both for users and for revenues - which are being largely powered by older cohorts, its model is becoming more and more profitable. When I say profitable of course, I mean that loosely in a non-GAAP sense assuming collections (non-GAAP measure) equaled revenues.Still, even non-GAAP, I think this fact is reason enough to buy WIX. WIX will be full year Adjusted EBITDA positive, is slowly seeing GAAP leverage - which isn't that big of a deal for me because I understand how the cohorts work over time (I also understand the front end hole that WIX has to go into to acquire new users), has a really low cash burn model inclusive of CAPEX, is well funded, and is showing to be a huge beneficiary of the overall movement online. Yes, that's still happening.As engines like WIX have made it easier for users to develop their own ""space"" online and as content has become an even more valuable commodity, the general space is still enjoying rapid rates of growth. This rising tide has created niche superpowers out of WIX, WordPress, and Squarespace. I just don't see a change to this status quo happening for a long, long time. I think that WIX has reached a point of velocity that its momentum for user acquisition is going to be hard to slow, it's now benefiting as much from its customer acquisition spend as its network (I think so). You could say that for the other two players as well.The space is big enough to have multiple winners and with WIX trading at just ~5X E2015 and ~3X E2016 sales (using Thomson estimates via Sentieo.com) that's a pretty low multiple to add a tech company at, especially one that should be EBITDA positive on the full year and should never be again. Plus, buyers get the added bonus of having WIX deploy new capabilities (some in Q2) throughout the year, which should act as a catalyst for shares.One final item to make note of, the broader creation engine niche is feeling a small tremor coming from a new entry competitor - The Grid. In doing some early research into The Grid, which hasn't launched yet but has built some substantial social interest and momentum, it looks like an incredible engine. I mean, it looks incredible. It also does some very special, long desired things that none of the existing Big Three do - so that matters as well.Now, I'm not sure if The Grid is going to offer a menu of subscription options but the one option it's currently advertising is running $96/year, which is in-line with a yearly subscription for WIX's Combo premium subscription packages and below but less expensive than WIX's Unlimited, eCommerce, and VIP packages. Once The Grid launches, I'll do some research into what exactly a user gets for that $96/year layout. If it's a competitive offering to WIX's Unlimited, eCommerce, and VIP packages (or better) at a lower price point, better user experience, etc., this could be something to watch very closely as The Grid scales up.The Grid being the newest entry into the space has had the luxury of building out its platform to be competitive. I wouldn't think it to squander that one-time opportunity. So stay tuned for updates on that.In the meantime, and even assuming The Grid comes out to rave reviews and a better engine, it will take it some time and some fund raising to build its network - which again, is the biggest differentiation and defense mechanism in the space (so far - maybe The Grid changes this).I like WIX as a buy and I think it should do well for investors in the near and midterm.Good luck everybody."
3902706,40031,2016-02-17T12:19:15-05:00,"Wix continues to deliver strong top line growth despite currency headwinds and is finally turning profitable and cash-flow positive.The company is well-positioned for continued growth.New verticals and product updates should lead to higher conversion, retention and ARPS going forward.Poor market sentiment has created an attractive entry point for long-term investors.","Wix's (NASDAQ:WIX) share price has been punished in the last few months due to the overall weakness in the general market. The underlying fundamentals are stronger than ever. Wix has finally turned a profit (on an EBITDA basis) and had positive cash flow in 2015. Strong currency headwinds in the last few quarters make these accomplishments even more encouraging. Wix is doing the right things to boost conversion and retention, and I expect the recent initiatives to have a positive effect on ARPS in the following quarters. I believe that poor market sentiment has created a solid buying opportunity for long-term investors. I am reiterating my view on Wix.Strong execution in 2015 despite continued currency headwinds2015 was another good year for Wix, despite the significant currency headwinds. The strong dollar took around $16 million from FY2015 collections, which were up 51% on a constant currency basis and up 41% on a reported basis. Revenues were up 50% Y/Y to $212 million in constant currency and up 43% Y/Y to $203.5 million on a reported basis.The number of registered users increased 32.8% to 77 million, while the number of premium subscribers rose 43.3% to 1.767 million. The conversion ratio has improved from 2.13% in Q4 2014 to 2.30% in Q4 2015.Profitability has improved significantly as well. Wix's adjusted EBITDA in 2015 was $14.7 million, with $7 million in Q4 alone, and was well above the company's initial guidance for $2 million to $5 million. Wix also provided a very solid Q1 and FY2016 guidance for collections, revenue and EBITDA (see table below).Source: Wix Q4 earnings reportOverall, there is little or no reason for concern. The company is increasing the number of verticals (Wix bookings, WixHotel with TripAdvisor Instant bookings being the most recent ones), which should increase customer stickiness and lead to increased upsell opportunities. Management stated on the Q4 2015 conference call that they intend to launch two significant products during 2016, which should have a significant effect on demand later this year, while the effect should be more pronounced in 2017. The potential impact of these products is not included in the FY2016 guidance. The increasing profitability is proof of the leverage potential of Wix's business, as expenses are growing less than collections and revenues, and margins are expected to benefit from these trends going forward. The FY2016 EBITDA guidance translates into an EBITDA margin in the 10% to 11% range, which is above the 7.2% margin in 2015, but below the Q4 2015 level of 12.4%. I think that there are two reasons for the EBITDA guidance for 2016 to be lower than the Q4 2015 level:Going forward, I expect collections and revenue growth to exceed SG&A and R&D expense growth, which should drive margins significantly higher and closer to the company's long-term goal of EBITDA margins north of 30%. The company has a proven marketing model, which drives substantial long-term returns on investment. For example, the Q1 2010 user cohort has a return of 14.1x for every invested dollar, while the Q1 2014 cohort has already returned $4.6 for every dollar invested. As these cohorts get bigger and as newer (and larger) cohorts mature over time, leverage should kick in and drive strong growth without the need for additional spending. Another reason to be optimistic is the fact that as the marketing team gains more experience, the conversion and retention should increase as well, which is already evident in the most recent cohort numbers. The number of premium users in the Q1 2013 cohort rose 48% after one year while the Q1 2014 cohort rose 58% after one year.Shift to annual payments having a negative effect on ARPS, but the introduction of new verticals and product updates should positively affect ARPS going forwardWix has also been very successful at converting monthly subscribers to annual subscribers, which is negatively affecting ARPS, but positively impacting cash flow and enabling faster marketing deployment. As of Q4 2015, 79% of subscribers were annual, which is a significant increase from 51% in Q1 2014. I expect the number of annual subscribers will plateau soon or grow much slower than in previous quarters, which should lead to a stabilization of ARPS. The other culprit for the lower ARPS is the strong dollar, which has made international ARPS lower. If the dollar is stable or weaker going forward, Wix's international segment should benefit. On an adjusted basis, the ARPS has trended higher over the last few quarters.Source: Q4 2015 earnings report presentationOn the other hand, constant improvements in user experience and the introduction of new tools and verticals should lead to increased retention and conversion in the following quarters. Increasing upsell opportunities should positively affect the ARPS and drive higher top line growth going forward. As I mentioned earlier in the article, management seemed pretty excited about the two new products that should hit the market this year, although they declined to reveal the nature of these two new products. They expect these two new products to drive stronger growth later this year and particularly in 2017.A combination of higher conversion and higher ARPS could have a profound effect on Wix's top and bottom line in the following years. A conversion rate of 2.50% by the end of 2016 (up from 2.30% at the end of 2015) is realistic in my view. I believe that the number of users by the end of the year will rise to 95 million to 100 million (an increase of 18 million to 23 million compared to an increase of around 19 million in 2015). This translates to premium subscribers in the 2.38 million to 2.5 million range by the end of 2016.On the other hand, if the quarterly ARPS rises 10% this year (from $33.33 in Q4 2015 to around $36.7), revenues should reach $87 million to $91 million in Q4 2016, which compares very favorably to the Q1 2016 guidance for revenues in the $60 million to $61 million range. However, while I believe that the conversion ratio and the expected number of users is realistic, an APRS increase of 10% is not realistic this year, and we will likely see either modest growth or no growth at all if the dollar continues to strengthen. Therefore, a more realistic scenario is a quarterly revenue run rate of around $80 million at the end of this year, which translates into an annual run rate of $320 million. Of course, a quarterly step up is going to take the company there. Based on these observations, I believe the company's guidance and analyst consensus are a bit on the conservative side. I expect 2016 revenues in the $275 million to $285 million range, which is $10 million above the company's guidance and the analyst consensus at mid-point.Margin expansion and solid long-term growth to lead to a higher valuationRelying on profitability was not a useful valuation tool for Wix in previous years. However, given the more reliable EBITDA margin outlook and the margin expansion potential in the following years, I think that it is a good idea to take a look at Wix on an EV/EBITDA basis and derive a new price target. Based on the company's EBITDA guidance for 2016, the company is trading at an EV/EBITDA ratio of 20. This might seem high for a conservative investor, but I think that it is too low from a growth perspective, since Wix's EBITDA is expected to double this year and grow rapidly in the following years as well. It is also worth mentioning that the 2016 EBITDA margin in the 10% to 11% range is far from the company's peak margin potential, which is north of 30%. In the table below, you can see my growth, EBITDA margin and price target model for the next three years.Source: Author's estimatesAs you can see, my year-end price target on Wix is $27 (down from $32, which was based on the P/S ratio), which translates into approximately 35% upside from the current price, while the expected two-year return is close to 60% based on the 2017 price target of $31. I believe that the targeted EV/EBITDA multiples are realistic, and perhaps even conservative considering the expected growth rates in the following years. These targets are also within the analyst price target range of $24 to $36 and the year-end price target is below the analyst mean of $28.RisksAs mentioned earlier, the strength of the U.S. dollar is a negative for Wix, especially considering the rapid international expansion in the last couple of quarters. Continued weakness of other currencies may continue to weigh on international revenues and ARPS. However, I do not see the dollar's strength as a major impediment for Wix's success.The company has so far been unaffected by the weakness in global economies, but a global recession may negatively impact its growth rates going forward. High growth rates and margin expansion are the basis for my thesis and a significant growth slowdown and/or margin contraction going forward could negatively affect the share price, as well as a prolonged equity bear market.Competition is another important factor to consider, but Wix has so far proven to be very successful in that regard and has managed to grow considerably despite the intense competition. Given the growing number of verticals and product improvements over the last few quarters, I think that Wix is well-positioned to grow its top and bottom line in the future. The company also has a solid balance sheet and has turned cash flow positive and has no need for additional financing, which has become a significant issue for many companies considering the plunging equity markets and tighter credit markets.ConclusionI believe that the recent market turmoil has resulted in a strong buying opportunity for long-term investors. The company has proven that it can have positive EBITDA margins and cash flow and grow revenues north of 30% at the same time, which is not very common in the SaaS space. The reward/risk ratio is skewed to the long side, and if the company manages to increase free cash flow as expected in the following quarters/years, a buyback program would be represent good use of the growing cash pile if the share price remains depressed in the following quarters."

It was founded in Israel in 2006 and went public in November 2013 and has since emerged as a global leader in the market with more than 73 million users registered to its services across 190 countries and more than 1.5 million new users each month. At this stage, 1.5 million of those 73 million users are premium subscribers. Other official numbers of Wix users are hard to find.Definition of a user as per prospectus:Number of registered users at period end is defined as the total number of users, including those who purchase premium subscriptions. Wix should communicate on the total number of published websites in order to have a better overview of the business growth.The number of registered users (73 million) is therefore materially inconsistent with the number of active users or the number of published websites as a user might never publish a website or might have multiple registrations. Even if the total number of registered users is misleading, the progression of the user base is still important to the growth of published websites (free version or premium accounts).Wix shows at this stage a sustainable growth of registered users, but also an increase of market share in the CMS universe over time.Some statisticsSource: Wix reportCMS market share in the Datanyze Universe(Only to use as a trend indication)Source: DatanyzeNumber of published websitesA lot of people are discussing and arguing about the progression of premium users, but what about the number of published websites (premium + free users), and why it is so important?As mentioned before, the growth of the registered users is impressive for this kind of business model (not all people need a website), but a registered user may never publish a website.We can find an indication, a trend, about the growth of published websites in the communicated numbers of published mobile sites disclosed each quarter, but users do not always convert their classic websites to the mobile version, therefore the number of published websites might be much more higher.Source: Quarterly reports - figures in millionsThe figures show an average of 1.3 million new published mobile sites each quarter, representing more than 5 million new published websites per year (Y/Y increase 166%).As the company counts 1.5 million premium users and 9.3 million published mobile sites (refer to the quarterly reports), we can easily conclude that the main users of Wix are free users.Free version comparison with the main DIY competitorsWix: The free version plan shows some pretty visible Wix ads. The company places two separate advertisements in the published websites. One towards the top right hand corner and the second one is a footer bar across the bottom. Both ads are visible at all times, no matter where you are on the website.Weebly: Only one advertisement placed in the footer of the website.Jimbo: It displays only a small button in the footer.Squarespace: No free version available.This, of course, leads to the obvious question: Why consumers use Wix with more visible ads, when they can chose competitors with more subtle advertisements?There may be a number of possible answers; either users do not know the competitors (not the best answer, as the competitors invest in marketing and are visible) or a huge number of users are unique users with multiple published websites, or last but not least, the most logical response, consumers prefer Wix.We can conclude that the inclusion of Wix ads on free websites is not considered by free the company's users as a constraint.Change in the terms of use: Advertisements/commercials as a new type of revenueAs for Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram, Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), revenues are mainly generated from advertising revenues. This will be also the case for Wix (not in the same proportion as the others, but with a huge potential).According to the initial and updated ""terms of use"":The inclusion of advertisements or commercials will be implemented once Wix has reached a certain number of published free version websites. As the company does not communicate on the number of published websites, it's hard to make assumptions, but this should happen on a medium- to long-term perspective.The inclusion of advertisements will show a significant impact on the revenues (with a minimum of 5 million mobile sites published each year). The best business model should show a win-win situation/configuration, where free users should also be rewarded depending on their website audience with ""Wix coins"" to buy gifts (as already done for Wix Education) or with a portion of money generated through the commercials (But this is only my personal recommendation).ConclusionBased solely on the premium business model, Wix shows already, at this stage, positive adjusted EBITDA and positive free cash flow (Q3 published report). Considering the perspective of the inclusion of advertisements in the future, Wix will reach another level of revenues.Wix's future growth is therefore highly underestimated."

This is where Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX) comes to mind.I think it is vital prior to any investment to fully understand exactly what a company does. Let's start off with what exactly Wix.com is and who they target. Wix.com is a full service solution for small businesses. They are one of the leading web development platform with over 65 million users. Wix empowers businesses, organizations, professionals, and individuals to take their business to the next level. Wix Editor is the main tool for users to build a website which is mobile optimized. You can literally build a site in 15 minutes using their solution. Don't believe me? Look here. I will talk further about the technology as I believe that this is the key advantage for Wix.Think what a business needs. You need a powerful social media connected website, a client or customer relationship management system, an email marketing tool, inventory management system, and many other things. When you think of this you are likely to use a variety of options. Maybe your email service is Constant Contact (NASDAQ:CTCT), and your website host is GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY), and your website was created on SquareSpace, and inventory and e-commerce done through Shopify (NYSE:SHOP). Wix does all this in one place. A visual is probably an easier way to see all the items in which Wix fulfils.Source: WIX Investor RelationsI look for economic moats in my investments. Here there are three evident ones - intangible assets through their technology, switching costs, and network effect. The Wix Editor is their crown jewel, their technological edge, and really separates them from their peers. The Wix Editor functions similar to Microsoft PowerPoint. You can place any text anywhere on the page, and even put pictures in any location.Another key aspect of Wix is its App store. Think Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and how you can make your phone much more functional by downloading certain productivity apps. Wix is no different, but they are the only one in this space doing this. Within the app store you can get the Shopify app to help manage your e-commerce, download the site commentary feature, or even make a website survey for users to fill out. Wix has hundreds of apps to choose from and enhances their ecosystem. The app store creates what I like to call a network effect. This is where apps are developed because of the large base of users which Wix has accumulated, and users are attracted by the amount of apps in the app store. In addition to this it now becomes difficult to switch programs. As users add new apps to their site, they become more entrenched in Wix, therefore leaving them no room to switch to another provider.Source: WIX Investor RelationsWix was one of the first to really master this space. They did not however stop at just making websites. They wanted to connect the computer to the phone in a simple way. Just back in 2008, this process was not easy, but as the use of phones grew the demand for small businesses propelled Wix to enhance their technology. In addition, Wix will release an updated version of their Wix Editor later this year. This will further increase their technological advantage over their peers.Source: WIX Investor RelationsAnother key difference in which Wix has vs. its peer group is one of its newer services, Wix Shoutout. Think of this as their version of Constant Contact. Here you can send out emails, promotions, surveys, collect emails, and much more on Wix Shoutout. The opportunity is great as their user count grows. If your think about it, Constant Contact does $350 million in annual revenues and is worth nearly $900 million. With those type of potential figures, this is a huge avenue for future growth. Today, there are 66 million contacts receiving shoutouts and 8 million items sold through Wix e-commerce products.Source: WIX Investor RelationsIn this business marketing is just as important as their product. Wix does not just offer this product here in the US. They offer this product all across the globe in over 10 languages. Also, the company has rolled out their own payment platforms for various countries. This is another thing in which WIX competitors just do not have to compete in scale. Their success is not just about their products, they have done a fine job marketing. As shown below, WIX has a YouTube channel for all the countries in which they operate. When looking into a freemium model, the key comes down to a structured marketing plan with close attention to the details. Wix pays close attention to the details and this is just one example.So now you know a little about the business. What's the opportunity here? It is inevitable that each business will need to improve their technology to become relevant and stay relevant thereafter. Companies need to communicate with their customers, offer promotions, take surveys, manage inventory. Wix does all this.Wix knows their place, and that is to provide a product for small businesses to operate in a highly competitive market. There are over 125 million small businesses around the world, with 27 million which start every month. Now some companies will need two to three sites. Let's use myself as an example. I have my blog themarketmeter.com which was created on WIX. I also have my resume site and a site for my wedding which is coming up. I realized just how easy this product was to use, that I began using it for ancillary reasons. The opportunity is huge, and below shows two visuals.Source: WIX Investor RelationsSource: WIX Investor RelationsNow let's turn to some of the financial figures. Wix reported on August 5th, and in my view reported exceptional figures. The company is seeing 34% user growth year-over-year, and an even higher figure for premium subscribers at 48% year over year.Source: WIX Investor RelationsCohort analysis shows that they are turning new users into premium users at their fastest clip ever. This looks at the number of new registered users and looks at how many of those users turn to premium and how quickly they turn. The latest quarter is the orange bar at the top. One key takeaway from this chart is that as you move into more recent quarters (top to bottom), the conversion rate improves. This signifies that Wix has continued to improve their product to increase conversions.Source: WIX Investor RelationsAnother metric in focus is their ability to turn marketing spend into revenue. Below looks confusing but it is really easy. This looks at the cohorts from left to right. The left bars show Q1 2015 new users, the marketing dollars which were spent during that quarter (yellow) and what that group of new users produces in revenue (blue). So the chart is showing that as time goes on they generate X amount times their marketing spend. An example is the Q1 2012 cohort. This group produced 4.2x their marketing spend in 14 quarters. The point is that the business produces long-term returns using short-term marketing spend.Source: WIX Investor RelationsThe company also generates revenue across the globe. As of today, the company generates 50% of their revenue outside the US. Each region is generating revenue growth above 40%. The fastest growing region is Asia growing at 63%, with the slowest region being US growing at 43%.Source: WIX Investor RelationsThis quarter the company saw the following results:The profitability was an important figure for investors to see that Wix can become profitable now and in the future. The adjusted EBITDA figure is one which makes sense in my view. It takes the net gain or loss and adds back hedging losses or gains, adds back stock compensation and change in deferred revenues. Given that this is a subscription business, deferred revenues can fluctuate.The company also talked about their outlook. Below is the summary. The company narrowed their full-year outlook but keeping the mid point almost the same. They increased their Adjusted EBITDA and are looking for 42% revenue growth on a mid point basis.Wix Earnings CallNow is this stock cheap?This past quarter showed that the company can leverage their business model into profitability. In the past they have disclosed their target margins of 86% gross margins, 18% R&D spend, 30% sales and marketing, 7% G&A, and Adjusted EBITDA at 30%. Without using those and focusing on top-line growth, the company is expected to grow sales at 33.20% over the next three years. Given the app market success, start of Wix Shoutout, increased growth internationally, and continued growth in small businesses, these sales figures seem reasonable. At those figures, Wix would be trading at 2.4 times sales.There are risks of course given that this is a competitive space. The risk comes from technology innovations from other companies. One company called Grid is trying to make website creation done through computer algorithms. This means your site will be created without any time or effort. Also, other companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could potentially get into this space.Lets compare the direct competition. Some of these companies are private or have been acquired. I wanted to look at the target market, their solution, whether it is do-it-yourself or not, how the support is, whether there is an app market, their 2017 price to sales, and revenue growth over this period. When looking at this, Wix looks attractively valued based on the features and revenue growth.Source: Sean Emory, Website Ranking Here, Bloomberg DataLastly, is the trend in Wix likely to continue relative to its direct do-it-yourself peers?I think so. Simply look at the target market and a simple Google trend search. As expected Go Daddy has the most relevancy on Google searched, but the trend is flat and rolled over. Wix on the other hand is trending higher and closing the gap. In addition, Wix is above that of its competitors Weebly, Squarespace, and Constant Contact. I added Constant Contact as this is a potential opportunity for Wix down the road.Conclusion:Wix is a premier company that is under-owned. The company is so much more than just a website creation site, rather a full service tool for small businesses. With a huge opportunity set, great management and great tools, Wix is a long-term holding to take advantage of the push to mobile and internet connectivity."
3321035,48411,2015-07-13T11:38:08-04:00,"Wix.com has launched a free, new user service called WixEd.WixEd is a “university” style online training program that helps “certify” users as wix.com web designers.It’s actually a really, really great idea by Wix and something that’s innovative enough to gain traction.I also think that what it can and should do for key metric growth at Wix should benefit its stock price.","Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX) has launched a free, new, user service called WixEd. WixEd is a ""university"" style online training program that helps ""certify"" users as wix.com web designers. It's actually a really, really great idea by Wix and something that's innovative enough to gain traction. I also think that what it can and should do for key metric growth at Wix should benefit its stock price.So the concept of WixEd isn't groundbreaking in that there are plenty of online education and ""app"" based education services - Duolingo, Coursera, Udemy, etc. What is groundbreaking is giving users the education (free of course), the platform of monetization, and the platform for distribution. You see what Wix has done here, right? Essentially Wix has created an affiliate marketing program at zero cost - well, very little cost. Wix of course is on the hook for the actual platform infrastructure and the minimal response feedback necessary to facilitate the program but that's it. Wix should see a massive ROI from this even at minimal levels of traction and engagement. Although, as I said above, I do think this will take off quite nicely.Even the ""infrastructure spend"" associated with WixEd is going to be something negligible, in my opinion. Wix already had a large part of the technical infrastructure in place simply from running its broader platform. Really, and again, the only outspend Wix is accounting for is the small overhead associated with the engagement team. This is a superbly thought out minimal risk overlay to the model that was already existing. I'm not sure what has taken Wix a rumored three years to launch WixEd (via techcrunch) but here it is and here is comes equity owners.So how does this benefit the stock price? Well, Wix users will now at the very least (assuming participation in WixEd) have the knowledge to expand their blogs into ancillary, premium Wix services. These of course include marketing, ecommerce, app services, etc. Any addition to the take rate for those services is of course accretive. Wix users will also now theoretically have the knowledge to optimize their existing wix.com page. Should a Wix user see higher rates of efficacy from his or page it stands to reason that user happiness would increase which also stands to reason that user retention would increase. Again, all good for the financials.But for me this is more an offensive move for Wix than a defensive one. With new competitors and optionality for how to host and market a blog/webpage (including the much anticipated TheGrid if it can ever get launched) coming into the competitive picture I think it's obvious that the space in general is growing and growing quickly. If it wasn't I'm not sure we would see the level of funding and development taking place into it that we are. Wix, I'm sure, being a leader in the niche realizes this and wants to continue to land grab at as fast a pace as possible. But Wix, I'm also sure, doesn't want to upset its status quo of efficient growth. Enter WixEd.WixEd, by giving users the Holy Trinity of ""get rich quick"", has potential to create an army of new (cringe) startups/marketers in the web designer vertical. In a weekend (at most) you could go from having zero clue to being a resume worthy, certified Wix web designer. That matters. It especially matters in the Ebay/Etsy/multi-level marketing sense. What do I mean by that?What I mean is that it's rare to hear about a genuine self-made millionaire that's selling multi-level marketed products. BUT, it's not rare to hear about say your brother in law who has 20 loyal monthly shoppers that buy Advocare from him. Why does he do it? Why not. Generally those selling multi-level marketing schemes aren't entirely dependent on the income yet it generates ""enough"" income to keep up the business. That's what Wix is going for with WixEd.Wix understands it's probably not going to launch the next self-made millionaire but it also understands that it can ""fill in"" a large part of the SMB market by educating and arming as many ""marketers"" of its service as possible. Also, that this only makes sense for ""marketers"" to do if they can monetize their collective efforts. Enter WixEd.I just think that is a brilliant, low-cost, overlay synergistic, and perfectly marketed initiative that at worst will increase some of the overall key metrics and at best will increase SMB market density. Wix.com is already a hugely popular and brand name SMB blog/webpage platform. WixEd should go a long way into making sure it stays that way.I continue to recommend a long position in Wix.Good luck everybody."
3542596,54942,2015-10-01T09:57:48-04:00,"The highly scalable, profitable, and sticky SaaS business model provides strong leverage growth capability while providing strong visibility into earnings and revenue.We think growth will be driven by increased conversion from the company's free model in addition to better retention rates.International growth is a nearly untapped market with massive potential for WIX that can develop a larger array of language templates and support.","Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) is a global web development company headquartered in Israel. Its platform has one of the largest registered users in the world with approximately 58 million in 190 countries. The company has pioneered a new approach to web development through a cloud-based platform that increased functionality and versatility. The company's core product attempts to bring website design to the mass population via an easy-to-use interface. The functionality allows small and medium-sized businesses to design highly functional sites that are e-commerce and social media-friendly - a fast growing market.We think the company has developed a successful and scalable formula for growing in a large, unpenetrated and fragmented market. There are many competitors in the space, but we believe many can thrive simultaneously in the industry and generate sustained, long-term profitability through premium upgrades and the SaaS business model.Business Model Provides Highly Scalable Platform For GrowthThe business model is fairly simple: Wix offers a free website design for registered domains with easy functionality, but then offer premium-valued services like apps, e-commerce, and social tie-ins that are supported via a paid monthly or annual subscription fee. Converting its free users to the premium subscription model is the key to the company's business, accomplished through compelling user recommendations for added website functionality.(Source: Investor Presentation)Wix's comprehensive array of features and functionality is what we think provides it a competitive advantage. The company has added several add-ons including the Wix App Market, an application market that allows users to select and simply add features and new functions to the website. Through its patented third-party application communication API, the company gives consumers added functionality for plug-and-play options, something most of its competition doesn't provide.On the back-end, strong customer support is another area where we think it differentiates with many of its competitors. Though the site focuses on easy-to-use design, the do-it-yourself space can frustrate and confuse customers who lack basic computer skills or knowledge. Wix is the only DIY platform that provides its customers one-on-one phone support as an option. Most of its competition is limited to email which has a high turnaround time, or live chat which is relegated to business hours. We believe this support option will allow for lower churn as customers are less apt to become frustrated and cancel/change providers.The design flexibility allows users to start from a blank webpage or utilize one of its 400 design templates. Compared to the competition, the company offers far more templates and is one of only a handful to offer full customization starting from a blank webpage. Another competitive advantage for the company. Within design, its patented technology allows full layout customization, permitting object placement anywhere on the page instead of limited placement and resizing capabilities at much of the competition.We think the value the company provides on added functionality coupled with the freemium business model is a strong combination for growth. While its costs are not the cheapest, the company has been able to convert approximately 3% of its registered users to paid subscribers.(Source: Investor Presentation)Growth OpportunitiesWe think the bottom line will be driven by four growth drivers: increasing conversion, increasing retention, increasing average revenue per user, and marketing efficiency. The company has a fast-growing and large addressable market with increasing ARPU. Total global websites are growing around 200 million sites per year which provides a substantial base of new business to the company. As the company increases its average revenue per user while moving into ancillary markets, we think the firm is setup for significant growth over the next few years. We think it has a significant amount of runway for growth in a largely fragmented and untapped market, especially within the global small-medium business space.The company noted that 73 million of the world's SMBs have yet to setup a website. While many of these businesses are likely small home-based operations, as the world connects the over 7 billion people to the Internet, most of which remain unconnected, the demand for a digital presence will continue to grow exponentially. Over the next five years, an e-commerce portal for any business will become essential.The company currently converts a very small percentage of the free users to the premium paid base. Subscribers typically register for the free version and then convert later to a premium subscriber in order utilize their own domain name instead of being a subset of Wix. We think enticing free users to convert is becoming easier and cheaper for Wix as the company capitalizes on better marketing while implementing significant enhancements to the premium functionality.The company has been adding over 300K new free registered users each week, which we think will continue as there is still a massive amount of the market untapped. Approximately 60% of its premium subscribers come from free registered users who setup their free site as far back as four years ago. These new customer adds supply the base of potential customers to the company's premium subscriber base. We think conversion rates will continue to increase as they did in the most recent quarter with premium payers increasing over 48% to 1.5+ million. This was only a slight deceleration from the previous quarter's 51% growth yoy.We believe conversion rates will climb as Wix continues to increase marketing spend but decreases it as a percentage of revenue. The company spent $1 million on marketing 22 quarters ago and demonstrated a 13.1x return on that investment. Our contention is that as it collects market intelligence on its customer base and ascertains what are the best drivers of conversion, it can utilize that knowledge and leverage that data to optimize its marketing spend.(Source: Investor Presentation)Average revenue per user is likely to climb over time, but we think the company sacrifices some ARPU in favor of additional paid subscribers in the near term. This way the company can at least generate some revenue and focus on up-sell opportunities to add to ARPU later along with boosting retention levels to drive profitability and growth.Retention rates should see continued improvement as Wix invests in new technologies and customer service while maintaining its value proposition to customers. As the company invests in editor enhancements, grows the app market place, and implements further mobile and vertical solutions, we see retention rates likely climbing much higher.Geographic Expansion Is A Main Growth DriverMost of its competition is located in North America and solely focuses on English-language sites. Wix's Israeli-based business has allowed it to focus more on international expansion through the addition of a wide-array of language suites. In the last year, it established billing operations for Russia, Mexico, South Korea, and Brazil, which allows it to collect credit card information and start charging customers.The WIX editor is currently available in 14 different languages, but we expect that to ramp over the next two years, especially within Asia where competition is scarce.The US still accounts for 51% of total revenue as of fiscal 2014, down from 71% five years ago. We believe international expansion is the low-hanging fruit for top line growth as its international presence should allow the company to capitalize on the emerging market web growth trend. We think Wix may partner with third-parties in order to roll-out additional language and billing capabilities and capitalize on first-mover advantage in many of these emerging economies.Below was a slide from a recent investor day presentation showing how conversion levels increased with each roll-out in Japan:(Source: Investor Presentation)ValuationWe think as the company continues to leverage its business model it should see increased cash flow and free cash flow inflection. This should be driven by the large market opportunity available to the company and increasing retention and customer conversion, boosting revenue and profitability. We see top-line growth averaging at least 30% between now and 2018 with a fairly high level of confidence. That confidence is driven by approximately half of the customers paying for the service annually - these are very sticky customers - with the other half paying monthly.While revenue per user is likely to decline near term, which we forecast in our model, we think premium user growth is likely to be at least maintained at current growth rates due to the increase in marketing spend and added functionality driving conversion. We think the current share price sets up the long opportunity fairly well as top line should grow fairly strongly and the company's guidance tends to be fairly accurate (again to the business model and percentage of annual payers).We think the shares are worth around $31-32 looking out a little more than a year. The 20x multiple is a significant discount to the current growth rate projected over the next five years where we expect a minimum of 30-35% bottom-line growth. This will be driven by the top-line growth while seeing a kicker from the business model's operating leverage and lower marketing spend as a percentage of revenue.At less than 2.5x EV/Revenue, we think the shares are a bargain as much of Wix's peer group trades at a multiple that is at least 50% higher. As the company approaches positive earnings, which we think could happen on a run-rate basis sometime in 2017, we think that multiple re-rates higher towards 3.5-4.0x and more in line with similar growing enterprises. At 3.5x revenue, the shares are worth $31 for an upside of 78%.ConclusionWix is a largely unheard-of recent IPO that has shed its financial sponsor overhang (lock-up expired last year) and has several growth drivers and competitive advantages that separate it from a crowded space. We think the recent weakness in the shares is related to global growth concerns, but that its expansion into new markets and adjacent areas like cloud services are more than offsetting the slower growth. As the company has a very scalable SaaS business model with more than half of its customers paying annually, we think the growth visibility is very evident, lowering overall risk. We think the shares are worth low $30s."
2806225,78265,2015-01-09T09:14:38-05:00,"Freemium services can be awesome. Even as awesome as King Entertainment's Candy Crush Saga.
        Wix.com is a freemium web platform that offers users a drag-and-drop website creator, free templates, and more. In other words: Wix.com is no Candy Crush Saga.
        Freemium is cool because it attracts customers. They just don't always give shareholders money.
        Sure, we could gamble on Wix's future profitability. Yet, in a new, changing industry, we'd rather wait for proof of that profitability.","Admit it. You've probably played a lot of Candy Crush. King Entertainment's (BATS:KING) Candy Crush is a shining example of a totally addictive ""freemium"" service that works. Because it's awesome. There are a number of totally successful freemium services, including the likes of LinkedIn, Dropbox, Evernote, and Skype (a lifesaver as we traveled for a year around Thailand).Nevertheless, the freemium model is certainly no license to print money. Freemium-based services can be great businesses--or they can be terrible businesses. Today, we want to look at the recent IPO Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX), a freemium-model website builder.Wix's Freemium Product MixFreeAccording to its 10-K, Wix free users have access to free templates, free Wix.com web hosting, free support, and more. For this, free websites display the relatively unsightly Wix advertisement in the footer, and use the Wix.com domain name.Source: A Free Wix.com WebsitePremiumWix premium, used by businesses and professionals, receive all of the features of free, but also include features like eCommerce apps, appointment apps, marketing tools like Google Analytics and mailing lists, greater storage and bandwidth, and more. 66% of Wix's paid subscriptions were annual and 34% were monthly. Premium customers, depending on the package, pay from $48 to $358.8 a year.Source: Company FilingsAccording to its 10-K, Wix has over 42 million registered users and over 789,753 premium subscriptions (as of December 31, 2013). That seems like a lot, and, well--it is, and it isn't. To put Wix into context, let's compare Wix to some of its peers in the CMS industry.IndustryAs Wix states in its 10-K:A totally non-academic search in Google for ""free website builder"" brings up a whole host of results. Some particularly mentionable names in the freemium website space include Weebly, Squarespace, Webnode, and many others.CMS market share. Source: DatanyzeThe dominant website builder is Wordpress.org (a paid content management system) followed by, well, more Wordpress (Wordpress.com, which offers free websites). Wix.com is a small piece of a large, fragmented pie. Many of those... slices of pie... have remarkably similar features, too. This is one reason we question the value of Wix's investment moat.As investors, we want to buy the most profitable company. In a market as fragmented as the CMS market, this leaves us with a few problems.To solve these problems, we decided to compare companies based not on their strict product offerings, but on how they made money. To us, more important than the relative virtues of one company vs. its incredibly similar peer - in this highly competitive and fragmented market - is how it makes money (and how much money it makes).This leads us to value Wix based on a relative valuation of its freemium-based pricing peers. How does Wix.com's freemium model compare, in profitability, to other companies in the freemium space? In this article, we'll examine the nature of the freemium model, comparing Wix.com to some of its publicly traded freemium competitors, and take a cold, hard look at Wix.com's performance.The Seductive Reality Of Freemium""Freemium"" is a pricing strategy by which a product or service is provided for free, but certain proprietary features, functionality, or virtual goods cost money. Lots of companies give their base products away for free to build a customer base--think of Dropbox, LinkedIn, Skype, AVG, Evernote, and so on.Forbes sums up the freemium fantasy well, in this five-step plan:Freemium is cool because it attracts customers. Unpaying customers, mind you. The beauty is that some percentage of the time, some percentage of those free users turn into paying customers.The nightmare, for many companies, is most don't. It's possible, simply, that the type of customer who wants stuff for free - you might call them ""freeloaders"" - tend not to want to spend money on stuff. And it's possible, simply, that the big spenders who want to pay may not be attracted by free stuff-for example, large companies with an expense budget aren't looking to get stuff for free--they're looking for the best, most comprehensive product solution (Wordpress.org, it seems from the above chart).And so it is that less than 2% - 1.87%, in fact - of Wix.com's users are premium.Source: Company filings and author compilationThe trouble with freemium is that too big a base of freeloading users can get expensive, and this can hurt profitability. From the start, Evernote was profitable (for $0.25 of gross revenue, $0.09 went to costs, and $0.16 was net income)--but that's certainly not the norm. So the question is, then, how's Wix.com's profitability?AnalysisIn the chart below, we compare Wix.com with some of its publicly traded freemium peers, including AVG Technologies (NYSE:AVG), Pandora (NYSE:P), King Digital , Changyou.com (NASDAQ:CYOU), LogMein (NASDAQ:LOGM), and LinkedIn (LNKD).Source: Gurufocus and author compilationAs illustrated by the chart above, the freemium model works well for some, and worse for others. AVG Technologies, as well as Candy Crush's King Digital, seem to be generating impressively large returns using a freemium model. Yet Wix.com underperforms on all measures of profitability, including ROA, ROE, and operating and net margin.And it's only getting worse for Wix.As Wix.com states in its 10-K:You can say that again. In fact, although Wix.com's revenue is increasing, its sales and marketing is increasing in tandem.Source: YChartsOn top of that (or, rather, well below it) is net income. Net income is moving in the wrong direction. Forget about ""achieving profitability""--Wix.com can't even stop the firehose of bleeding red losses.Next, its operating and profit margins have gone from ""terrible"" to ""atrocious."" With a profit margin of -41.9%,Source: YChartsWix's costs are - quite frankly - out of control. Wix.com's profit margin - -41.9% - indicates that it loses $-0.42 of net income for each dollar of sales. For Goodness' sake, somebody rescue them from this bloodbath.It's terribly stable return on assets and return on equity are consistently bad.Source: YChartsIt's unsurprising, then, that Wix.com underperforms its technology industry peers by a large spread.Source: Morningstar and author compilationIn particular:ConclusionWix.com is a freemium web platform that offers users a drag-and-drop website creator, free templates, and more. Some investors may suggest that Wix.com may have the potential for incredible growth. Yet, as the company states itself:And sure, we could gamble on Wix's future profitability. Yet, in a new, changing industry, we'd rather wait for proof of that profitability. So far, that profit has eluded Wix.com.Until then, we believe that investors can get better risk-adjusted returns elsewhere. It's not a race. As Warren Buffett suggests:So investors: avoid Wix.com--or at least, wait for it to show real signs of real profitability, and then - and only then - swing for the fences. In the meantime, investors who love the ""freemium"" model are probably better off sticking to buying those in-app Boosters for Candy Crush Saga, which, as we said earlier, are awesome."
3236576,40031,2015-06-04T12:35:04-04:00,"Wix is executing its growth strategy and the conversion and retention rates have improved and the company is on the way become profitable on an EBITDA basis in 2H 2015.Increasing awareness and marketing spending to positively impact future growth rates.We are seeing evidence of increasing operating leverage, but the company has a long way to go in order to achieve its long-term margin goals.Addressing some of the prior bearish arguments.Recent rally has brought Wix near my previous price target, but I believe that it has more room to run.","Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) has performed very well in the last couple of weeks and its share price is just 4% below my $26 price target. The company has increased spending significantly in order to increase awareness and drive higher conversion of free users to premium subscribers and the results are visible in the company's financial statements. The Super Bowl ad campaign was a success and the company has recently announced a new campaign with Heidi Klum, which should act as another boost for brand awareness and have a positive effect on growth rates. The company is also on its way to becoming profitable on an EBITDA basis in the second half of the year as the operating leverage of its business model kicks in and as revenues outgrow spending. I am reiterating my view on Wix and raising my price target to reflect the recent positive changes.Revenue growth solid in Q1 despite FX headwindsWix raised the full-year revenue and EBITDA outlook (see table below) despite FX headwinds when it announced the Q1 results. Given the currency headwinds, I think this is a solid accomplishment. Collections in Q1 increased 49% to $55.9 million, while they were up 58% on a constant currency basis to $58.6 million. The company added 4.6 million registered users in Q1 to reach 62.5 million at the end of March, a 35% Y/Y increase. Premium prescriptions rose 138,000 to 1.37 million, a 51% increase over the same period last year.Source: Wix Q1 reportLarge addressable market with a lot of SMBs needing more than ""just a website""SMBs are Wix's primary focus. The number of global SMBs is above 125 million with over 500,000 SMBs started every month in the U.S. alone. A large portion (approximately 70%) of SMBs do not even have a website and about 45% of the SMBs who do not have a website say that creating one is either expensive, complex or time consuming. Additionally, 70% of existing SMB websites are not optimized for mobile, which can be an important ""turn-off"" for prospective customers. Given the increasing importance of the internet, and especially the importance of mobile, I think that we should see a continued strong increase in the number of SMB websites, which bodes well for Wix's future. And a good portion of these SMBs that are expected to come online will need more than ""just a website"" and this is where Wix's premium offerings come in. Due to the increasing complexity of websites and the importance of social integration and mobile support, I think that a lot of SMBs will turn to Wix in order to get their website up and running to satisfy the growing online needs of their prospective customers. The company's vertical penetration is also delivering the results and WixStores is one of the important verticals that I expect to gain significant traction going forward. WixStores' premium subscription allows users to create a virtual store to sell products online and process payments using an integrated shopping cart app. The company also launched a WixStores platform in 2015, which allows merchants to create an online store and a full set of store management tools like payment processing, inventory management and shipping. I believe that this is a huge upsell opportunity for Wix and that it should gain significant traction going forward and allow the company to additionally increase the conversion and retention rates as well as the ARPU and this should prove as a ""must have"" for e-commerce oriented SMBs. The company also has more tools that should help increase the ARPU going forward. One of these tools is the Wix ShoutOut, which was launched in Q3 2014. Wix ShoutOut enables users to easily create and send customized newsletters, updates, promotions and e-mail campaigns directly from their Wix dashboard. These new tools and options should result in additional appeal to free users and should lead to more free users wanting to become premium subscribers. The complex set of solutions that are easy to use and implement with a slight additional cost should be a win-win combination for both Wix and its potential and existing customers.Going forward, I expect the company to increase the ARPU on these new verticals and additional functionalities which should drive revenue growth ahead of user growth and may result in growth acceleration in the following quarters, as opposed to current expectations for slowing growth. These tools also serve as a point of significant differentiation when we compare it to the competition. The company's long-term goal is to create an ecosystemIncreasing conversion and user cohort behavior points to cost effectiveness of marketing spendingWix's freemium model seems to be working and the company's focus on increasing conversion rates is starting to pay off, although the rate is still low at around 2.2% at the end of Q1, but it is still a solid improvement over just 1.75% at the end of 2011. Increasing website complexity and the need for an integrated solution along with Wix's new product offerings should lead to further improvement in conversion rates going forward. Retention rates are also improving and an increasing number of users are opting for an annual subscription, which enables the company to accelerate sales and marketing efforts. Annual subscriptions as a percentage of total new subscriptions were around 50% at the end of 2013 and have risen to 74% at the start of 2015 and they were around 77% at the end of Q1 2015.And while some are concerned with a serious ramp up in R&D and sales and marketing spending in the last couple of quarters, I think that it is very good for the long-term top and bottom line growth. The company's user cohorts are behaving predictably which enables good planning and TROI (time return on (marketing) investment). The company's goal is to maximize premium subscription growth at a targeted TROI of 7 to 9 months. Looking back to Q1 2010, the company has a relatively consistent user cohort with approximately the same number of users at the end of Q1 2015 compared to the start of the measuring period, while the higher conversion has led to an increased number of users in the last two cohorts, which is evidenced by sharper upticks in the chart below.Source: Wix investor presentationThe drivers of higher conversion and retention are the before mentioned tools and the added functionalities along the way: new languages in 2011, HTML 5 and the app market in 2012, HTML5 mobile and Google apps 2012-2013 and the recent vertical penetration with WixStores, WixHotels and WixMusic along with WixShoutOut. The retention is important since the company has no incremental marketing costs once it acquires a user. As an example, the Q1 2010 cohort has brought in $13 in collections for every $1 spent on marketing, while the Q1 2011 cohort has brought approximately $6 for every dollar spent on marketing. This is the basis for the company's increasing operating leverage in the future, which did not have a chance to show itself due to ever rising R&D and sales and marketing costs in recent quarters, which are needed as a basic function of faster growth.Super Bowl, Heidi Klum and the case for increasing awarenessWix made a big move with the Super Bowl ad campaign this year. The company's #ItsThatEasy campaign featured five NFL legends and their transition from football to small business owners and showed that challenges are made significantly easier with a Wix website. It was a month-long campaign and has resulted in more than 2,000 press mentions and 350 million press impressions. Wix was exposed to a large number of viewers which has significantly increased the brand awareness and should positively affect the growth rates this year. The company reported a 40% increase in brand awareness following the Super Bowl ad, which is a meaningful accomplishment.The company went further with the branding campaign in May, when it announced that a new ad campaign starring supermodel Heidi Klum and actor Rex Lee would hit the screens on May 14. The campaign will follow Heidi Klum ""seeking the next business venture to add to her already busy life."" While these campaigns will increase the near-term expenses, they should have a beneficial effect on the rising brand awareness and eventually result in higher user growth and revenue growth.Why becoming profitable (albeit at an EBITDA basis) is a big deal for WixWix initially planned to become profitable on an EBITDA basis by the end of 2015, but this goal has been pushed to Q2 or Q3 as a result of better than expected execution. I think that this is a big deal for Wix and should put the bearish arguments to rest to a certain degree, although the company is still far from delivering positive net margins. The bearish arguments that I have found when researching Wix are that the ever-rising costs will not allow the company to become profitable. This is essentially not true, and Wix could still grow even with a significantly decreased sales and marketing spending due to the facts stated above. Old cohorts are providing the needed scale and I think that the company could easily grow collections 5% to 10% a year with significantly reduced sales and marketing spending, which would result in significant operating leverage and bring the margins significantly higher. We are already seeing a moderation in expense growth, as R&D expenses have increased 105%, 65% and 45% Y/Y in the last three quarters respectively, while sales and marketing expenses increased 70%, 66% and 45% Y/Y in the last three quarters. Both the R&D and sales and marketing spending are finally growing less than the overall revenue growth which is what we should expect going forward and will result in increased operating leverage. The company is actually targeting the long-term EBITDA margin around 30% or higher, and I think that it could get there in 3 to 5 years. The days of negative EBITDA margins are likely behind us and once the company achieves additional scale, the current share price should prove as a bargain.ValuationI noted in my previous article the established P/S valuation trends and expected the company to keep trading in a P/S ratio range of 5 to 6 with the potential to expand back to the 7 to 8 range. While the stock failed to exceed the lower range by much, it has indeed traded in the expected 5 to 6 range and I do not think that we will see the P/S ratio significantly higher unless the growth accelerates, which might happen given the awareness campaign. I am raising my price target from $26 to $32 on rising growth expectations and a solid increase in EBITDA guidance. The new price target is based on a 2015 P/S ratio range of 6. The long-term upside could be significantly higher, but Wix should continue to perform well in the short and medium term as well. The new price target translates into almost 30% upside from the current price.Source: Yahoo! Finance, Wix earnings reportsAddressing the bearish arguments and looking at potential risksOne of the main bearish arguments in the past was the absence of profitability. I think that this is not a serious issue and it is not unusual for companies to sacrifice short-term profitability for higher long-term top line growth. The return on marketing investment on older cohorts is a clear example of the operating leverage the company has, as it incurs no additional marketing costs and reaps the long-term collection benefits. I also stated earlier in the article that I see the company growing its top line 5% to 10% in a conservative scenario with flat or even lower Y/Y growth in sales and marketing expenses in the next couple of years, which could lead to significant operating leverage and result in EBITDA margins north of 30%, which is the targeted long-term margin. The accelerated spending is a function of rapid growth and margins are the necessary sacrifice to achieve this goal.Low conversion rates are another argument, but the conversion rates are increasing and given the company's current valuation and future expectations, they do not need to trend significantly higher for the company to achieve its long-term goals. I also pointed out earlier in the article that the company has several levers that it can pull to increase conversion and retention going forward, and the results are already visible as the conversion rates are increasing, while the greater percentage of annual prescriptions is another good indicator of future success. The upsell opportunities are also rising with new verticals and useful tools and a higher ARPU is also likely in the next couple of quarters and should lead to higher revenues and margins going forward.The third bearish argument is the lack of differentiation - ""you could just use WordPress"" or any other free tool, but this is not the case. WordPress is essentially a blog creation tool and the users need to know how to code or hire someone to do it for them, which differs from Wix's drag-and-drop solutions. I encourage readers to read the latest article on Wix from a fellow contributor Lior Ronen, where he interviewed Wix's CFO, who explained in detail Wix's differentiation from the companies that might have been perceived as competitors and the advantages the company has over real competitors.I also think that investors are not focusing on profitability anyway, and this is an issue that would need to be addressed two to three years down the road, since the main focus right now is paying users and top line growth, but we should already see an improvement in EBITDA margins this year. And if this is the main bearish argument, I do not expect any serious trouble for Wix anytime soon.The real risk here is a serious slowdown in revenue growth, since it is the metric investors are carefully watching. A significant slowdown could lead to a meaningful correction in Wix's share price, depending on the level of change in future expectations.ConclusionWix is positioned to grow significantly in the following years and reward its shareholders with solid gains. The ongoing awareness campaign should result in higher user growth, the predictable cohort behavior should drive significant long-term collections and make marketing spending measurable while the new verticals and tools should lead to higher conversion and retention rates. Continued execution of the growth strategy and EBITDA profitability by the end of 2015 should put the bearish arguments to rest and bring Wix closer to my new $32 price target."
3070236,61281,2015-04-14T16:59:00-04:00,Wix CFO Lior Shemesh sheds some light on the most relevant and interesting topics related to Wix.The company is much more than just a website builder - it is an overall solution that allows SMBs to manage their entire business online.Wix opened a technology gap from the competition and worked to increase it even further.Wix has a number of new initiatives that will enable the company to expand its offering to SMBs.,"I met with Lior Shemesh, Wix's (NASDAQ:WIX) CFO, in the company's headquarters in Tel Aviv to talk about the company's strategy and how it differentiates itself from the many competitors in the web services market. In a long conversation, we were able to touch upon many topics, from how successful Wix's freemium model is, to what is driving the success, and from how vertical solutions and complimentary services fit into the corporate strategy, to why R&D expansion is so important to Wix and how Wix sees the competition. We talked about Wix's plans, and I learned about the company's intention to penetrate the mobile apps market, its global expansion plans for 2015, and its relationship with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).In the last part of the conversation, we talked about the local equity market in Israel, how the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange ended up with very few technology companies listed, and how current regulatory status is driving more and more Israeli start-ups abroad.Wix is located in a unique place in Tel Aviv, just near the port and far away from the city's vibrant financial center or high-tech areas. This location, just a few meters from the Mediterranean Sea, is perfect scenery for my conversation with Mr. Shemesh.Brief OverviewWix is an Israeli start-up specializing in website building capabilities and additional complimentary services for small and medium businesses. Wix operates on a freemium business model in which a registered user can create a website with minimal capabilities for free and can upgrade to receive more enhanced capabilities and better site functionality. There are 63M registered users of Wix, and 2% (1.2M) of them are paying premium customers. The company generated $142M in revenues in 2014 mainly from its core business of website building services and also from new vertical solutions that were recently released, contact management tool Wix ShoutOut, and the Wix App market. Wix revenue guidance for 2015 of $202M reflects 42% year-over-year growth and should drive the company toward a positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time.For a further overview of Wix, you can see my previous articles on the company available in this link.Web services market and Wix differentiationQ: Market services is very competitive, with a large number of players and low barriers to entry. There are three categories of players in the market: (1) independent developers that offer white label solutions based on HTML5, Flash and Joomla; (2) bigger players that offer pure play website-building solutions such as WordPress, Weebly, and Squarespace; (3) and hosting and domain players that offer website-building solutions as part of their portfolio such as GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY), Endurance (NASDAQ:EIGI) and Web.com (WWWW). What differentiates Wix from all these players?A: ""Let's see what separates Wix from every group and then from our significant competitors. The first group of white label solution makers offer expensive and more complicated solutions that usually look outdated and are similar to many other websites you saw before. I do not consider them real competition to Wix. WordPress is a blog creation tool, the best blog creation tool available, but it is not the same solution as Wix offers. In order to build a WordPress-based website, you need to know how to code or hire someone to do it for you. This is different from the drag-and-drop solution Wix offers. The third group of GoDaddy, Endurance and Web.com are services companies that sell domains and hosting and use their website builders as a gateway to complimentary web services. They do not compete with Wix.Now, let's look at Weebly and Squarespace: Our solution is different from theirs. As Avishai (Avishai Abrahami, Wix's CEO) showed during the recent analyst day, building a website on these platforms is a different experience than doing it on Wix. If you try to add a picture, place some wording on top of it, and then try to move it around, you'll find out that you cannot do it on these platforms. They are not true HTML5 drag-and-drop solutions, and your ability to create a website that reflects your vision as a business owner of how you want your website to look like is very limited. You cannot go beyond the template, and you are restricted to use it in a very specific way while, in Wix, two plumbers can use the same template and end up with two different websites. On top of the user experience and platform functionality, we have a significant technological gap from our competitors. We are bigger than Weebly and Squarespace not only in market share, but also in R&D headcount. That creates the technological gap between Wix and them. Wix has a number of technological solutions that our competition does not have, such as the Wix App Market, our vertical solutions, our mobile capabilities, and a comparable solution to our WixHive.""Q: Can you elaborate on the mobile capabilities and the WixHive?A: ""Wix is the first and only company that offers web applications with a shared database that is a very common feature of mobile applications. When you install WhatsApp, LinkedIn or Facebook, for example, the app can extract the list of contacts you have on your phone and use it, if you agree, without any manual downloading or uploading required. WixHive allows business owners to communicate with their customers easily through many applications in the Wix App Market. A business owner can send a coupon to all customers who purchased something on the store during the last month using Wix capabilities.The mobile solution that we offer is different and has a sophisticated technology behind it. Remember, Wix is a flexible drag-and-drop platform, and it requires many efforts to translate your adjusted template into a mobile website that looks good and is perfectly functional. In other sites, where templates are fixed and not flexible, it's much easier to transform a desktop site to a mobile site. However, the fact we can do it in a much more complex environment reflects the technological gap.Moreover, in the future, our users will be able to transform their websites to native apps with a click of a button. They will have a dedicated, standalone app that enables business owners to interact best with their clients. This app will be available in the Google Play and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Store. This capability to create a native app is going to be built-in as part of the new WixRestaurant vertical solution we will introduce in Q2'15. The new e-commerce vertical solution will have a dedicated version of this feature that will allow store owners to create a native e-commerce app for their store.""Q: This means that the native app creation capability will have a security feature embedded in it, right?A: ""Yes, and behind the scenes, we will take care of the Google Play/App Store registration with Google and Apple. This new feature will allow small business owners to transform their websites into mobile apps in a cost-efficient and simple way.""Q: I guess these native apps will be offered free in Google Play/App Store to avoid any revenue split between Google, Apple and Wix. Right?A: ""Yes, that is correct.""Q: Most small business owners around the world start the journey to build their website in a domain registration, usually in GoDaddy, and in the next phase, they reach GoDaddy's website builder. Why do they need Wix?A: ""GoDaddy is a fantastic company with a super strong brand in the U.S., and it's most likely that you will go to GoDaddy, Endurance, Web.com or Tucows (NASDAQ:TCX) to purchase a domain. And these companies use their website builders as gateways to other services.""Q: The domain registration market is not very profitable, and they are trying to expand their offering.A: ""Correct. They offer their website builder at a relatively low price, but you need to add storage, hosting, web applications, marketing tools, SSL, etc. on top of that. You end up buying many services separately and paying a lot more than you would have paid for a similar package through Wix. A large portion of our customers purchased their domains in these companies I just mentioned and decided to build their website in Wix because the website-building solutions they were offered were not good enough. The technological gap between Wix and these companies is significant because we are a software company, and they are services companies.""Q: What's the difference?A: ""GoDaddy's ability to offer additional services is limited and based on acquisitions. We developed Wix ShoutOut (Wix ShoutOut is a contact management tool that allows one to send marketing emails to particular customers). In a few months, GoDaddy had to purchase a company (The Mad Mimi acquisition was in August 2014), and that's the difference between a services company and a software company.""Vertical SolutionsQ: Wix has a number of vertical solutions for hotels, musicians, restaurants and e-commerce. Do you see any increase in the conversion rate as a result of these new solutions?A: ""Yes. Take the hotels solution for example. Since we launched it, we see higher conversion from free to the premium by hotels, and we see a much higher conversion rate in 2014 than 2013 due to these new solutions. We plan to expand the vertical solutions also to the App Market so that a dentist could see what apps fit him best in the App Market instantly. I believe this will increase both the conversion rate in the future and the ARPU (average revenue per user).""Q: Aren't you concerned from competing with Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE) and Priceline (PCLN) in the Hotels market?A: ""I do not think we compete with Expedia and Priceline, only we offer a simple and straightforward solution for an audience that had very little options before. Wix provides an additional solution for hotel owners to run their business online in a simple and efficient way and maintain their business in Expedia or Booking.com in parallel. These sites offer a great ability to increase traffic, and Wix offers an excellent online services platform for SMBs. I think that we can even cooperate with Priceline, Airbnb, Expedia, etc. to create an even better solution for our customers.Global ExpansionQ: Wix is addressing customers in developed countries with entrepreneurship orientation and open connection to the international banking system. What is your solution for the rest of the markets?A: ""First of all, Weebly and Squarespace are not present at all outside of North America, only Jimdo, but they are tiny and don't challenge Wix. Also, the services companies are not present outside of the U.S., UK and India. In Wix's case, more than 50% are generated outside of North America - from South America, Europe, Asia and the Pacific. We are the only real global company in the market, and our ability to penetrate additional markets is better than all the other companies mentioned above.""Q: You talked about worldwide revenues, but you can see that Asia and South America are weak markets at Wix (as shown in the chart below on the Q4 earnings). During the recent analyst day, you gave Brazil and Japan as examples of your penetration strategy into these markets. Can you elaborate?A: ""Brazil is the third biggest country in revenue generation in Wix. United States is number one. The UK is number two, and then Brazil. In the South American market, Wix is more dominant by far than any of our competitors. Weebly and Squarespace are not there as well as GoDaddy, Endurance and Web.com.""Q: If Wix is so dominant in South America, how come only 10% of revenues are generated in this region? What are the problems in your global expansion?A: ""First of all, we grew fast in South America in 2014 and we increased our South American revenues more than 100% and we see this region as a significant growth driver, but there are payment and billing problems that we are working to solve. Take Mexico for example. We translated out the platform to Spanish, and it works excellent in Spain and generates decent revenues. However, in Mexico, even though the platform is in Spanish, the number of premium users was almost zero because there are very few Mexicans with international credit cards.""Q: Can't you solve it with PayPal?A: ""PayPal does not work in these markets.""Q: So how do you solve it?A: ""We created our billing system that controls the road map, and every quarter we add new gateway and new payment processors. That means that in order to penetrate the Mexican market, I need to integrate our billing system with the local wire transfer system, with a local gateway that uses debit cards, and with Mexican e-wallets. We face the same problems in Russia, where many people use Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) and QIWI (NASDAQ:QIWI) e-walls, and even in Germany, where they mainly use local debit cards instead of international credit cards. Our billing system is so robust that in Brazil we assist Google to process their Google Apps payments. This ability is not trivial, and it allows us to expand worldwide quickly and accept payment from additional markets. This year we will add Mexico, Colombia, Peru and Argentina to our billing system.""Future Possible InitiativesQ: You mentioned that Wix provides comprehensive services for SMBs. Have you considered providing data analytics services to SMBs, maybe for security purposes? Wix collects all the data about the traffic in its customers' websites.A: ""We need to see how we use big data on our platform. We have plans for the future to implement such capabilities but, naturally, I cannot elaborate more.""Q: What about creating an internal advertising network for Wix customers? Wix can use the large number of businesses already in its network and offer to display advertising content from other Wix customers. Wix benefits from additional revenue, and customers benefit either from advertising revenue for displaying ads on their site or from an efficient and effective marketing medium. Is that something you will consider?A: ""You should never say never, but right now, this is not something that we will consider.""Q: There are many examples that the freemium model is not sustainable for the long term. Are you looking for additional revenue not generated from such a business model? Maybe projects for large corporations?A: ""We are still growing both in our top line and organically, so this kind of idea is not relevant in the meantime. We currently focus on increasing our conversion rate and ARPU substantially and improving our products and technology to increase the gap from our competition so we become an industry standard. Right now, our vertical solutions and other complimentary services are tactical moves, and the strategy is to improve our technology so much that we will open a gap that our competitors will not be able to close. When you look at our Cohorts chart (below) that we presented in our analyst day, you can see that our business model works perfectly because it is freemium. (Wix defines Cohort as the number of new registered users added in a period generated by a fixed amount of marketing expense in the same period).Let's look at the Q1 '10 cohort when 919,221 new users registered to Wix and 18,513 of them became premium customers in the first quarter. Five years later, there are 19,329 premium customers in the same cohort, resulting from that same group that registered back in Q1 '10. Our freemium model does not only attract customers to be able to offset the churn, but it also drives an increase in premium customers over time. The marketing effort to increase the number of premium customers in each cohort is minimal, as the main effort is made to attract customers to the cohort in the first place. So, this one-time effort drives an increasing amount of revenues, even 20 quarters after a group of users registered to Wix.""Q: How can you explain that?A: ""There are a number of reasons. First, Wix has additional services, such as the App Market, Wix ShoutOut and Vertical Solutions. Second, when a user registered to Wix five years ago while he was a college student, and now when his business is ready for a website, he is already familiar with us and will upgrade to a premium package. Third, with every user, you can create a number of sites. You can try and test any template and any feature for free before you choose to become a premium customer.""Q: What about profitability? Is it even a target that you strive for?A: ""Of course, Wix could have been profitable in 2014, but we wanted to invest further in our R&D and technology to drive growth. Wix doubled its R&D headcount since the IPO and is expected to continue the increase in 2015, probably not in the same pace, but fast enough to be able to grow. I expect that our top line will grow faster in 2015 than our R&D, and, as we stated in our analyst day and latest 2015 guidance, we expected to deliver a positively adjusted EBITDA in 2015.""Israeli Equity MarketQ: We sit here in Tel Aviv, speaking in Hebrew about Wix, and I cannot avoid asking where you stand, regarding the latest attempt to revive the Israeli equity market. The Israeli Securities Authority (the Israeli equivalent of the American SEC) and Tel Aviv Stock Exchange management try to come up with some solutions to attract Israeli companies to list their stocks on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Solutions vary from an Israeli version for ADRs, filing relief based on SEC filings, minor regulatory exemptions for small IPOs, etc. What about Wix? Does Wix have any added value for trade in Tel Aviv?A: ""Once the extensive regulation burden is minimized, I do not overrule dual-listing in New York and Tel Aviv. However, in the current situation, this will be a burden for us.""Q: What do you mean?A: ""I think that the local capital markets and equity market specifically are ill mainly because of the regulation requirements. In the past, there were many Israeli companies that were dual-listed in Tel Aviv and New York or London, and now many Israeli companies not only prefer to be solely traded abroad but also they prefer to register elsewhere. Companies like Mobileye (NYSE:MBLY) and Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) - and the list is very long - are a big miss for the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, but they have a superb reason to avoid dual listing. In order to be dual-listed, a company needs to follow two sets of regulations, and we do not receive any relief in Israel. Yossi (Yossi Beinart, Tel Aviv Stock Exchange CEO) is doing an excellent job, but he needs help from Israeli regulators.""Q: So why does Wix stay in Tel Aviv?A: ""We stay here because we are Israelis, our management is in Israel, (AND) we are very patriotic and want to contribute more to Israel. Right now, Wix is the biggest web company in Israel, and we opened an academy to educate people from the North and South about the Internet market. We try to develop a market that hardly existed in Israel, but we cannot do it alone. It becomes more frequent that Israeli start-ups are registered abroad and not in Israel, and you need to lift some of the regulations requirements to attract these start-ups to the local market. Right now, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange has mainly industrial and real estate companies listed, and with all the local and foreign bonds listed (bonds are listed and traded on Tel Aviv Stock Exchange), we are losing the technology sector. Israel should strive to become a corporate center for Israeli companies, not just a global R&D center in order to create a new Check Point (NASDAQ:CHKP).""Q: Do you think that an Israeli equivalent to the American JOBS ACT and the recent A+ regulation could solve this?A: ""I think that could be a great point to begin. Confidential filing is an excellent option for a start-up to sense the field and see whether there is a demand for its shares and whether it should continue a public offering.Q: Do you think that we have the infrastructure in Israel to have a technology sector in the local stock exchange?A: ""Current proficiency of local technology analysts is improving, but foreign analysts can cover Israeli companies as well. We need to create the ecosystem: more analysts that genuinely understand technology, institutional investors and local investment funds that are interested to invest in Israeli tech companies and technology companies that want to trade on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. In order to develop this ecosystem, start-up companies like Wix need the full cooperation of the regulatory bodies in Israel."""
2664785,61281,2014-11-10T11:52:40-05:00,"A few months ago, Wix announced a new product line of industry-specific features to address specific needs of certain industries not covered in the current Wix platform.Wix expects to increase conversion to premium plans through the new features and drive higher revenues as a result.In 2015, Wix forecasts adjusted EBITDA profitability driven by revenue growth slightly offset by an increase in operational expenses.","Website development platform Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX) reported Q3'14 earnings last week with record high quarterly revenues that were $1.8M above analyst consensus and reflected 75% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter growth. As shown in Chart 1 below, Wix revenues grew rapidly at a quarterly rate of 15% and an annual rate of 54%. Wix slightly increased its 2014 outlook from $137M to $139.5M and reaffirmed expectations to deliver record quarterly revenues in Q4'14.During Q2'14, Wix started implementing a new product line in its popular website development platform that targets a specific market. Until August, Wix offered a one-size-fits-all simple platform where business owners or individuals could create their website in do-it-yourself fashion. Wix offered templates, design ideas and complementary services to help customers from different markets and industries create their site by using the same development platform. However, that way of thinking might be too simplistic and some industries may have specific requirements Wix's current platform could not meet.In August 2014, Wix announced WixHotels, the company's first industry-specific solution aimed at the hotel and travel agent markets. WixHotels enables small travel agencies and boutique hotels to accept and manage reservations through a Wix-dedicated platform, not online traveling services, such as Booking.com, Agoda and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE). By transferring to the self-maintained WixHotels platforms, small hotels can save the fee they pay online travel services and directly interact with their customers online. As mentioned in a previous Seeking Alpha article, Wix identified inefficiencies in the online accommodation industry and created a tailor-made solution for that industry to attract premium subscribers to Wix.At the end of October, Wix announced its acquisition of OpenRest, a provider of online ordering and mobile solutions for independent restaurants. The OpenRest acquisition will allow Wix to offer restaurant owners a dedicated solution to accept and manage reservations and orders from the Wix platform. Similar to the WixHotels case, Wix identified an inefficiency in the restaurant business in which independent restaurants need to use the services of third-party platforms to publicize their restaurants and receive orders. The new feature based on the OpenRest acquisition will be available in 2015 for Wix customers. It will enable small restaurant owners to gain full control over the content and design now controlled by online reservation sites such as TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), OpenTable and a large number of local sites.In its Q3'14 earnings call, Wix introduced WixStores, a new feature targeted at small and medium retailers that will be available toward the end of this year. According to Wix's announcement, the new feature will be a significant improvement on the current eCommerce offering from Wix and will allow store owners to manage their stores from a mobile device.Conversion RateAs shown in Chart 2 below, from Q1'13, the number of Wix premium subscribers grew faster than the number of registered users. However, both numbers were in a declining trend. The declining trend also occurred in revenues, where the quarterly growth rate was 15%. Q4'14 is expected to produce just 5% sequential growth.The industry specific features discussed in this article are emerging revenue streams of Wix and should accelerate conversion from registered users to premium subscribers. Based on recent years, Wix can deliver steady revenue growth. These new industry-specific features should drive its revenues higher in 2015.As shown in Chart 3 below, the market is undervaluing Wix's growth and innovation as its stock trades around its IPO price. After the stock rallied at the beginning of 2014, it experienced a sharp decline fueled by the GoDaddy IPO filing, a secondary offering and the broad-based tech stocks drop.If Wix can increase conversion to premium subscriptions as a result of its new vertical strategy, its stock should bounce back. Toward 2015, Wix plans to expand marketing and R&D efforts to increase revenues and release new vertical features. In the Q3'14 earnings release, WiX CFO, Lior Shemesh, announced that the company expects significant financial improvement and will reach profitability on an adjusted EBITDA basis in the second half of 2015.ConclusionWix continues to invest in its industry-focused solutions to unlock great potential in inefficient markets. Wix expects WixHotels, OpenRest and WixStores to accelerate conversion to premium plans and increase revenues. I plan to stick with my long position in Wix, as I expect renewed upside as this strategy takes shape."
2496115,72905,2014-09-15T13:33:59-04:00,Internet access and number of websites are growing globally.Wix has penetration in the right areas of the world.Wix will see outsized long-term gains.,"Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX) is a leading do-it-yourself website development platform. It was founded in Israel in 2006 and has since emerged as a global leader in the space with over 50M global users. Wix filed for its IPO and started trading publicly on November 6, 2013, giving every investor the opportunity to be a part of the company. This post explains part of why I feel Wix is a good investment opportunity and how it compares to its peers.Internet developmentInternet growth is booming. While the internet may seem like old news to many people in developed regions, most of the world is not yet connected. For many places in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, the internet is a new arrival. With the addition of programs like Google Loon and the explosion of smartphone accessibility, more and more people will continue to get connected.Website developmentWhile the number of people that access the internet is expanding, the number of people creating websites is growing at a greater rate. Notice the green line below, which shows the number of web users divided by the number of websites. The lower the green line goes, the more websites per user that are being created.Data for the above here.Market penetrationIn understanding who might lead an industry, you have to make comparisons among competitors. Features plays a big role, but for now, let's assume that all the platforms are created equal. The next question then is market penetration.The chart posted below is a Google trends chart comparing relative popularity of search terms globally. It compares Wix, SquareSpace, Weebly, and WordPress. As you can see, WordPress is way ahead (in green).It is a known fact that WordPress has the most market share but I would not consider them a direct competitor. WordPress is not a DIY platform as it requires coding for any real customization and it is definitely not drag-and-drop. The bigger issue from a business standpoint is that they monetize less than 1% of their users and are not in much hurry to change that. In fact, doing so runs a bit counter to their open source philosophy.So taking WordPress off the table, let's get a bit more granular on the true Wix competitors.Here, again, we have a global Google trends chart. As we can see, Wix is ahead, with Weebly close behind and SquareSpace lagging a bit.Another way to look at it is Alexa.com rank:This shows Weebly ranking in first place in the USA and narrowly above Wix globally. SquareSpace, again, is lagging a bit.While the above is a good start, I think it is also prudent to look more closely at which geographic areas each platform has penetration in - this way we can look at areas where there is more long-term growth potential.WeeblyAs we see below, Weebly has most of their penetration in English speaking places such as Australia, New Zealand, the United States and the United Kingdom. These countries are also areas that have some of the most mature internet populations.SquareSpaceHere, again, we see penetration in the United States, Australia, Canada, etc. These mature markets are ones that are already largely developed from an internet standpoint.WixLooking at the chart below, Wix is way ahead of the game with respect to penetration in emerging internet areas. Beyond what you see on the list, places like India and China are also more colored in than the charts for Weebly and SquareSpace.Penetration final thoughtsWorking in mature internet areas is fine, since there is still significant growth to be had, and there is generally more purchasing power in those regions. But in thinking about 5-10 year growth, it is better to look at markets that will see exponential growth.Wix sees terrific market penetration in areas that have some of the best room for growth. You can see that the top 5 regional WIX results all fall into the areas where there is currently less than 50% internet penetration by population (the first graph). This shows how Wix will lead the way in areas where the internet will see some of the most explosive growth in the next years.ExpansionSo we have seen that Wix has penetration in the right areas as far as long-term internet growth goes. But the other piece to this puzzle is expansion in these areas. One of the key indicators for expansion is how much companies are spending to expand. So let's take a look…SquareSpaceSquareSpace has decided to grow more organically. They have 190 employees with $38 million in total outside investment. 1 2 While they are focused on growth as well, basic math tells us that their commitment to organic growth means they can only expand with the money they are making.WeeblyWeebly has taken very little outside funding ($650K) and says it funds growth organically as well. They say they are adding about 500 more employees and have expanded into a 50,000 sq. ft. building in San Francisco. 1 But, same as the point above, running profitable means less money with which to expand.WixWix raised over 100 million dollars in its IPO for the company to continue to fund its growth. Wix has seen three consecutive years with over 100% growth in revenue each year. Wix CEO, Avishai Abrahami, said, ""The growth potential is huge, particularly in trying to penetrate globally into more regions. The decision was to raise money now so that we could continue to improve R&D and to invest more in marketing to pursue those other users."" 1 Wix is hiring at all its international locations and just opened a new office in San Francisco.If reasons behind the value of quicker expansion aren't too obvious, here's a nice visual to help reinforce the point. This shows the more spent on expansion earlier on, the higher the loss in the short term, but the larger the gain in the long term.SourceFundamentalsWix reported its 2014 Q2 financial results with record high revenues and minor improvements in net & operating profit margins. The company had Q2 revenue of $33.9M, amounting to an 18% increase Q/Q and 82% increase Y/Y, beating analysts' expectations.Wix has been able to extract very high lifetime value from its premium users. The chart below shows under a year to recoup the initial marketing cost of acquisition and a 9X return on marketing spend after just 4 years.This revenue is explained by the low churn and the long and consistent tail of additional premium conversions. Even many years after a user signed up for the free plan. Notice the tail in the chart below of users continuing to sign up 3 and 4 years later.Wix expects that they may even achieve up to 80% rate at converting users during their lifetime.ConclusionThe internet is growing quickly, but even faster growth is seen in the number of websites created. Wix has penetration in better markets globally and is spending more money on expanding. This is reinforced by the following graph.I believe this will create a situation that generates more long-term value for Wix compared to its competitors. Beyond picking the winner, just because Microsoft and Apple compete doesn't mean investing in one or both is a bad idea. Jeff Epstein, former CFO of Oracle and Bessemer partner, told a Stanford MBA class that he recommends getting involved in industries that will see 10X growth. He said that by the fact that you are involved in an industry with that much growth, your odds improve for being wildly successful.

2739035,77545,2014-12-09T11:24:28-05:00,"Wix has converted a small percentage of users to paying members.Wix's ideal customer is very narrow, the company admits it itself.Subscriber rates are down 3 consecutive quarters, while marketing & R&D expenses are up.","Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) has over 54.1 million registered users, of which, 1.125 million currently pay Wix each year or month. The immediate question that comes to my mind when I see figures like this is:If Wix's software is great... why aren't more people willing to pay for it?Think about it. Over 50 million websites built on Wix, but only about 1 million decided to actually pay for it.In the case of Wix - I believe all 3 statements are true.How does Wix make money?I always like to investigate how a company makes money - and with Wix, it's not a very complex web of income streams. Wix makes money selling hosting plans (and domains) that are similar to what competitors offer.Source: Wix Pricing InformationThe first thing I notice about Wix's pricing structure is unless you need features like more storage space, your own dot-com domain name, or need a shopping cart - you just use Wix for free. Considering nearly 53 of the 54 million sites created on Wix never pay... I think it's safe to say most people don't need/want the services Wix is trying to sell.As a side note, these are yearly plans - if you pay month-to-month the price goes up. Also, Wix often offers discounts via social media and e-mail offers to free & paid members. It's actually a key strategy Wix uses to acquire customers:Not only are the conversions from free to paid users very low, but the company has to discount the service as a primary method to attract new customers.Clearly, the vast majority of people who have tried Wix decided they don't need the features Wix is charging for. Since 2011, the company has spent over $100,000,000 on R&D developing proprietary drag/drop software that it gives away for free. Instead, Wix charges for things like hosting & domains... which is a competitive business filled with many low-cost providers.Let's take a look at some of Wix's competitors and see how their pricing stacks ups. I like doing this when analyzing companies because it's likely what a potential customer would do as well. Also, it gives you an idea if a company has any pricing power now, or in the future.Weebly is a very close competitor to Wix - as it features a similar drag & drop website building function as its main selling point. Weebly boasts on its website it has over 20 million websites created using the service. Like Wix, you are confined to using Weebly's software and cannot install something like Wordpress or any kind of custom built website you might want to use.Source: Weebly Pricing PlansWeebly does charge in a slightly different way than Wix on the lower end plans. Until you get to the $8/mo ""Pro"" pricing plan, you are limited to the number of pages your website can have, along with other limited features. One advantage Weebly could have over Wix is even the 'Free' plan can have up to 5 ecommerce products if customers agree to a 3% transaction fee. Ultimately, though, the two are very similar on the higher end plans, which makes this more of a marketing & customer acquisition competition than a feature-for-feature competition in the long run.GoDaddy is one of the world's largest domain registrars, and is a logical place a customer might compare Wix to as well. While GoDaddy doesn't offer the drag/drop software Wix & Weebly provide - you can install numerous content management systems like Wordpress, Joomla and Drupal with a few clicks. A user also has the freedom to run programming language like HTML5, PHP, jQuery, JavaScript, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Muse, Flash, vBulletin, etc., etc. Ultimately, that might be a larger addressable market than what Wix can reach, but I'll get to that later. Let's take a look at the current pricing GoDaddy offers for its hosting plans:Source: GoDaddy Pricing InformationNotice that GoDaddy offers an introductory rate, but even when that rate escalates - it's inline or even cheaper than a competing plan Wix offers. More importantly, starting with the Deluxe plan on GoDaddy, which costs $8.99/mo - you can host unlimited websites for that price. With Wix, a user would need to pay for a hosting plan for each individual website they create, therefore narrowing the target Wix customer even further.Wix's target customer I believe is fairly narrow (which is likely why the new subscriber rate is declining - something I will provide more detail on later). Here is my idea of the ideal Wix customer:After all (or most) of these conditions are met - we are getting down to a very small segment of the webmaster universe. Getting people to sign up for free has been the easy part for Wix (and plenty of other websites)... but finding the narrow customer who is willing to pay you every month is not a small challenge.Don't just take my word for it though. Wix admits itself that it is targeting a narrow set of customers too:Not sure why Wix needs to run a Super Bowl ad when it's trying to target restaurant owners... but I'll address the marketing spend in a moment.Bottom line, Wix isn't a 'one stop shop' for everyone needing a website. Its drag/drop software attracts lots of free users - but certainly turns away others who need different solutions. As time goes on, Wix will have even more difficulty finding new customers. In fact, Wix's growth rate already appears to be slowing.Net Premium Subscriptions AddsEach quarter, the company has reported the net premium subscribers and the total number of premium subscribers at the top of press releases.2013 4th Quarter = 83,000 (790,000 Total)2014 1st Quarter = 118,000 (908,000 Total)2014 2nd Quarter = 110,000 (1,019,000 Total)2014 3rd Quarter = 106,000 (1,125,000 Total)As you can see, the net additional premium subscribers has declined for 3 consecutive quarters. This isn't at all shocking to me considering Wix's ideal customer base is a small segment of the overall market.More important to me is not the headline premium subscriber number or even the net premium subscribers - I'm more curious about how much is it costing Wix to acquire a premium subscriber?2013 4th Quarter- Revenue ... $24,943,000- Expenses ... $30,135,000 ($16.542m Marketing)2014 1st Quarter- Revenue ... $28,847,000- Expenses ... $38,104,000 ($21.178m Marketing)2014 2nd Quarter- Revenue ... $33,931,000 - Expenses ... $41,048,000 ($23.708m Marketing)2014 3rd Quarter- Revenue ... $37,504,000- Expenses ... $44,372,000 ($24.788 Marketing)Source - Wix Q3 2014 Data SheetSo Wix is spending more on marketing each quarter, but is adding less premium subscribers. If Wix was already profitable, it might not be an enormous concern. However, Wix has generated a net loss during every quarter it's reported to shareholders since 2011. That's why when I read articles that describe Wix as ""fast growing"" - I'm wondering if the author is referring to the marketing spend or the net premium subscribers, as each are moving in opposite directions.In order to become profitable, Wix needs more paying customers, but in order to acquire that customer - it's costing the company more & more marketing dollars. Recently the company boasted about buying a Super Bowl ad. According to estimates, it's roughly $4.5m just for the ad, not to mention the production costs. Guess it's safe to assume the Q4 marketing spend will be up again?More importantly, the story Wix's management is telling investors about the company isn't adding up to me. Why buy a Super Bowl ad when the company is admittedly targeting a narrow segment of the industry? That doesn't make any sense and more importantly sounds like a huge waste of money.R&D SpendingThe marketing/customer acquisition challenge isn't the only one Wix faces. Keeping up with web standards & programming languages is difficult, especially when you're reacting to changes like Wix is.When Wix launched, it utilized Adobe Flash, which isn't compatible with Apple devices & browsers. This wasn't a massive problem when Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) dominated the PC landscape, however in 2007 Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) released something called the iPhone, which revolutionized how people consumed the web. It ushered in new ways website owners could present content, including responsive website layouts utilizing HTML5 programming language.Wix has been historically slow to adapt to these changes. It wasn't until 2012 when Wix released an HTML5 editor that was compatible with Apple products - by then the iPhone was already in its 5th generation.Despite having an HTML5 editor now, websites built on Wix are not responsive. Essentially a responsive website automatically re-sizes content & menu areas of a website as the size of the screen/browser changes. The primary benefit for a website owner is you only need to set up 1 website - and it will conform to the device & screen size automatically. Wix software is not capable of doing this at this time - and users are required to create a mobile website along with a desktop version if they want their website to re-size on smaller screens. While this does add some ability to customize each version of your website - theoretically the users attracted to Wix are ones that want something simple & easy to use. Does laying out 2 separate websites sound simple or easy?In order for Wix to keep pace with competitors, the company will need to continue to adapt to changing web standards. This all comes at a cost to the company & ultimately shareholders. To understand better the challenge Wix faces developing & maintaining its software platform, the research & development expenses are as follows:2013 4th Quarter = $10.444m2014 1st Quarter = $11.966m2014 2nd Quarter = $13.729m2014 3rd Quarter = $15.573mSource - Wix Q3 2014 Data SheetSo Wix is spending more on marketing AND more on R&D - while net premium subscribers are declining. Again, might not be an enormous concern for some companies, however Wix is not profitable and needs to scale the business up in order to be.Bottom line is Wix has built a drag/drop website creation tool that is always going to have limitations and require investment in order to keep pace with competitors. In reality, Wix is not an innovative tech company, rather one that is reacting. I believe this, along with substantial customer acquisition costs are massive risks the company faces; on top of not being profitable.Other Ways Wix Can MonetizeOne could easily argue that Wix's business model isn't even mature yet, and the way it generates revenue is limited to a narrow method. I can buy into that story - but Wix's management would need to develop additional ways to monetize the user-base more effectively to get me to fully buy into that idea.So far the plan of attack has been advertise via pay-per-click ads on search engines like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), run television ads (including a Super Bowl ad) and acquire relatively niche products for hotel managers & restaurant owners. Niche software platforms like Uber and Airbnb have taken off in recent years, so it's conceivable Wix could acquire or develop something similar - but until that day comes, I'd rather focus on reality.The reality is Wix does have some ways it can monetize its user base more effectively, I just don't see management - or bullish articles ever articulating any as potential sources of upside for the company in the future.So with that - here are my thoughts on how Wix could generate revenue differently than it currently does today:Wix could potentially run ads for 3rd parties on all the non-paying websites. Currently Wix runs ads/links to itself promoting that the site is setup on Wix. While this is likely a relatively cheap marketing strategy, it doesn't appear to be driving new premium subscribers at an increasing rate. Quite possibly the ads aren't annoying enough - and it could be argued that more traditional banner ads could drive users to pay Wix in order to remove them.The majority of Wix's products today are geared toward the lower end, or budget conscious website owner. Businesses exist that require far more advanced (and expensive) website capabilities than what Wix offers. To an extent, Wix is trying to address this by allowing 3rd parties to build 'apps' that add to the functionality of Wix. More to the point, the company's acquisition of hotel & restaurant management software platforms could conceivably be offered at a higher price point/margin because of the nature of the customer. Additionally, if you think about it - there are dozens of competitors that serve the low-end of the website hosting market, while the higher end client might actually be where the lower hanging fruit is.Wix could change the definition of the premium subscriber. Remember, in order to pay Wix any money - I must want additional features for my website - otherwise I don't pay Wix anything. Those additional features are similar to what competitors offer, which means Wix competes on something other than its core differentiating feature - the drag/drop software.I'm speculating here, but I think it's worth doing if you're a long-term shareholder. The release of the iPhone affected Wix in a major way, imagine the next innovation. You could argue Wix's drag/drop software is innovative - but the way it monetizes customers is not.Wix StoresIn October, Wix announced it is 'revamping' the e-commerce platform on the website. This is an example of the R&D challenge Wix faces, as it will constantly need to revamp & introduce new features.E-commerce customers are valuable to Wix. They pay more per month/year than other users and Wix can monetize these customers differently than it can with blogs or small business websites.One thing is for sure, it seems like it's against the company's 'philosophy' to go down the eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) or Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) route of charging per transaction on its ecommerce platform. On the last quarterly conference call, analyst Nat Schindler of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch wanted further details on the WixStores pricing model.To which CEO Avishai Abrahami replied:To be honest, that same philosophy seems to be working out well for Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) - but charging for transactions also worked out pretty well for eBay, Amazon and others too.Ultimately, it is Wix's challenge to find businesses that want to setup their own e-commerce online store. Many businesses already have a solution, others might be too large or small to use Wix. Others might just want to pay someone else to do it. Any way you slice it, Wix will only capture a small segment of the market and it will likely cost the company tremendous resources in order to acquire those customers.Dilution RiskOn March 20, 2014, the company announced it had filed an F-1 statement with the hopes of raising up to $86.3m in a follow-on offering. Just 11 days later, the company withdrew the filing, stating that ""adverse market conditions"" were the reason. The conditions the company was referring to was the stock selling off $3.66 per share, or about 13%.At some point you have to imagine this group of insiders will want to exit. If Wix was growing at an accelerating rate, dilution might not be your worst fear - however, as stated above, Wix's growth rate is actually declining, while expense are increasing. Add in a dilutive fundraising round and that's not an investment I'd want to be in.ConclusionWix is spending more to acquire less customers each quarter. Unless Wix management innovates on some new ways to monetize the product, the company will be caught in a spiraling circle of spending with no way out."
2580605,61281,2014-10-21T17:23:20-04:00,"After an 89% rally post-IPO and a 53% drop, Wix’s stock is currently traded at its IPO price.Wix presents impressive quarter-over-quarter increases in revenue and user base driven by increased number of premium subscriptions.Wix is actively working to increase its revenues through global expansion and a wider portfolio.Future growth offers potential upside of almost 30% in stock price.","Wix (NASDAQ: WIX), an Israeli website development platform, went public last year, raising $127M with an IPO price of $16.5 per share. Four months after it went public, Wix's stock completed an 89% rally and hit an all time high price of $31.32 followed by a 53% correction that was fueled by a failed attempt for a secondary offering in March 2014 and by GoDaddy's IPO filing in April 2014 that pushed the stock further down. As shown in chart 1 below, since the pullback, Wix is traded at its IPO price in attractive multiples and a 1-year price target.Business OverviewWix operates in a freemium business model, i.e., offering a free basic package to registered users who can upgrade to a premium plan and enjoy larger storage, additional templates, e-commerce platform, external domain connection and ad-free websites. Wix has more than 50 million users registered to its services, where one million of these are premium subscribers. Percentage of premium subscribers out of the total registered users might seem small in the first glance. However, it increases every quarter and in fact the percentage of registered users that convert to premium subscriptions increase quarter over quarter. As shown in chart 2, the quarter-over-quarter increase of premium subscriptions is higher than the quarter-over-quarter increase of registered users, which means that every quarter more premium subscriptions are added than users in the free plan.This trend of users' conversion from free plans to premium plans has a direct impact on the company's revenues that increased at the quarterly rate of 15% in the last three years. Even though, Wix has an impressive quarterly revenue growth rate, the company is actively looking to increase its revenues further.Wix focused its R&D on enabling new features to attract new customers. Wix introduced several new features lately, which include WixShoutOut for newsletter distributions, Etsy integration and some new apps in Wix's app market, however the interesting news for investors is from other areas.In June, the company announced that it partnered with Google in the Google Domains initiative that is supposed to help Wix introduce its platform to a larger audience than it previously was able to and generate a new incoming cash flow as a result. Two months later, Wix introduced a new reservations feature named WixHotels, targeted at small travel agencies and boutique hotels. This feature allows the agency/hotel to create and maintain their reservations independently, and consequently save the fees previously paid to Booking.com, Expedia, etc. WixHotels marks a change in Wix's mindset. Wix identified a specific market that would benefit from a unique solution and actively pursued that opportunity. If Wix expands this model into additional markets, it could further expand revenues beyond the 15% quarterly rate.Wix's SG&A is focused on global expansion and, for the first time, international revenues generated slightly more than 50% of the total revenues with expansion into Brazil and Russia.ValuationWix is trading at a P/S ratio of 5.81 and, with a $137M revenue outlook for 2014, there is potential of an upside of 28% in Wix's stock by the end of the year. However, if Wix continues to increase revenues at its current quarterly pace of 15% per quarter, the company will generate more than $140M in annual revenue for 2014, and will offer an even higher upside for shareholders.ConclusionsWix increases its user base and revenues every quarter and has a proven ability to generate revenues from its current freemium model. After the post-IPO rally, Wix's stock price plunged from its all time high to an all time low, in just three months. Since the correction, Wix's stock could not bounce back, and it's currently trading at its IPO price. In light of the attractive multiples, company revenue trends, new business initiatives, and current low share price, this might appear a good time to buy into Wix and capture its future upside."
2679345,68855,2014-11-13T14:48:16-05:00,WIX is a high growth business with unlimited opportunities.The company is predictable with reoccurring revenues and has no debt.Potential takeover target from some of the large players in the internet space.,"When investing in a company it is important to lay out a clear repeatable game plan. Our game plan focuses on quality at each step in the process and is as follows...Management: Management teams drive business activity, and restrain or release shareholder value by the decisions they make.Thematic View: Understanding the industry dynamics and what will lead to above market growth opportunities.Economic Moat: Uncovering and quantifying an economic moat which makes it difficult for new entrants.Stable and Above Market Earnings Growth: Predictability in earnings and cash flow generation is usually handed a premium valuation. If one can determine that future earnings will be more or less predictable, one can put more faith in valuation analysis.Dividends: A company that has the ability to pay a dividend and increase dividends over time creates shareholder value.Valuation: Given that we are valuation sensitive we harvest intrinsic values under various market conditions.Patience: One of the hardest things to do in investing is staying patient. Investors need to trust the process and stay within the game plan. Once an entry point is determined, one must stick to this entry point.In the past we have taken a deep dive into three investments.Today let's take a look at WIX (NASDAQ:WIX). To get started I think it is very important to understand exactly what a company does. You must understand the product, the distribution channel, management, and many of the other core components of the business.OverviewBelow is a detailed analysis of WIX. In its simplest form, WIX allows you to build websites in a way that is just as easy as using PowerPoint. The process of creating a site takes no coding experience at all. The distribution channel also is simple. They use traditional advertising to lure customers to their site. These customers can then use their platform free of charge or subscribe if they want to remove the WIX logos. They currently offer a wide range of cost packages from as low as $79 a year.Below is an example of the WIX website. They offer hundreds of website templates with a free mobile version attached. You can either use one of their templates or start from a blank canvas.Source: WIX SiteOnce you are on your template you have a range of options to choose from. These options are called the WIX App Market. The app market offers hundreds of apps and is similar to how iTunes functions. There are a host of outside developers which create apps to list on the market. Like iTunes there are free apps and apps that have ad-on costs. Below is an illustration of what the app store looks like. The app market facilitated by WIX really separates it from its peers. Below is an example of what the app market looks like today. Users can add everything from web page analytics to a Shopify app to better serve ecommerce businesses.Source: WIX SiteAs you can see, the product is great and easy to use. WIX also has a robust support system to ensure that there is guidance at every step of the development process. Below is an example of a video which describes how to get started with WIX. This type of support is vital and helps to create repeat customers and build brand loyalty.Source: WIX SiteI now hope you have a better understanding of just how easy this product is to use, how beneficial it is to business owners, and the effort put in by management. Now I want to go into some of the key investment characteristics.Management:Wix was founded in 2006 by Avishai Abrahami, Nadav Abrahami and Giora Kaplan. They successfully created Wix.com which is now the leading cloud-based web development platform with more than 54 million registered users worldwide. On 5 November 2013, the partners took Wix public, offering on the Nasdaq, raising about $127 million for the company and some shareholders. The company is an Israeli-based outfit with operations in Israel and the US. From a management standpoint, while it is difficult to judge their past success prior to WIX, it is clear that they have what it takes to build a business and a successful brand. All three founders remain on the team with executive roles. Aviashai is the CEO and Chairman, Giora is the current Chief Technology Officer, and Nadav is the Vice President of client development. We like that all three founders remain in the company today.Theme:We look for companies with secular tailwinds within their niche. The chart below beautifully highlights the biggest factors supporting WIX's long-term growth.Global population has risen from 6.5 billion in 2005 to 7.2 billion in 2013. With that rise has come a fall in the amount of users NOT using the internet. Both trends are supportive for WIX's growth as they benefit from higher internet usage.Today more and more small businesses are creating web pages to enhance visibility. Likewise given the ease of use which WIX provides, websites are being created for short-term events. For example, WIX generates a ton of business from single events like a wedding. Another example is the use of websites for individuals looking to showcase themselves, similar to resumes, or business cards.Source: Global Internet UsageEconomic Moat:WIX has generated and continues to improve upon its economic moat. Two moats stand out.1) WIX has a high switching cost. Once a customer has created a site with valuable information, it may make more sense to keep using WIX rather than starting over with a new provider. Similarly, WIX has added features such as the App market and the WIX Shoutout, which further entrenches customers within their platform.2) The second moat is the network effect. As more and more users get on WIX, the more enticing it is for creative app developers to begin to code and create more apps.Stable Earnings:I broke out stable earnings versus above market earnings into two different categories. The company remains in its infancy stage, and they are not generating any profits. This usually makes a company non investable until they show profits or a clear plan to profits.WIX has clearly articulated a plan to become profitable. The company has set margin targets which seem very much attainable given how the company operates. Gross margins are extremely wide given the low fixed costs of the product. This means scalability is large, and costs mostly come from the employee and compensation side of the income statement. Below is the summary of the company targets. Much of the money is going directly to costs for sales and marketing and research and development. One fact to know is that over 50% of WIX's employees are engineers, which also signifies their dedication to innovation.While the company is not yet turning a profit, management now believes that they will start to become profitable in early to mid-2015.Source: WIX QuarterlySource: WIX QuarterlyAbove Market GrowthThe key for growth in WIX is the ability to convert marketing spend into registered users, and subsequently converting registered users into premium users. The chart of ""users and subscriptions"" perfectly illustrates their ability to not only get users at a high rate, but convert them at an even faster rate.Source: WIX QuarterlyIn addition to that, the company has been able to acquire more annual based subscriptions. An annual based subscription model is exactly what every business and investor wants. Reoccurring revenue makes earnings and cash flow more predictable. In 2010 only 50% of the users were annual, however that number has risen to 70% as of the most recent quarter. During the conference call management was asked about why they were gaining more annual based subscriptions. Management replied with a thoughtful answer, referencing that the quality of the product continues to improve. As a user of WIX myself, the product has improved and continues to improve every week.Source: WIX QuarterlyDividendsThe company currently does not pay a dividend, and I do not foresee a dividend in the near future. As the company matures, I could see WIX paying a dividend. A business with a reoccurring revenue stream and earnings predictability are commonly dividend payers.ValuationHere is the toughest part to cope with. Valuation for a company not generating earnings can become tricky and can lead to significant losses. Let's take a look at some numbers provided from the latest quarter.These numbers are astounding. However we need to model out current revenue growth with future margin expansion. Given that the target margin levels provided by management seem very much reasonable into the future, we used that as the base case. Using 5% sensitivity in both directions, we do a discounted cash flow analysis. Our required rate of return is 10%, which is our base target for most companies. Keep in mind WIX has no debt. Our target multiple is 25 times and terminal growth is 3.5%. We get three fair values averaging out at $33.59. In addition we looked at comparable valuations based off of revenues. WIX is currently trading at nearly 4 times revenue, but most importantly around 2 times 2017 revenue. At this level with the hyper growth and natural industry tailwind, it is clear that the stock offers some long-term value. For your own reference, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) with flat growth is trading at 2.5 times revenue, Pandora (NYSE:P) at 5 times revenue, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) at 6 times revenue. Therefore from a comparable valuation analysis, and discounted cash flow analysis, the stock offers value.OtherThere are other great things to say about WIX. Like their vertical integration of products. WIX has created a product template for hotels, which allows for them to easily market and book directly through their site. Also, they acquired a business several weeks ago which does a very similar thing for restaurants. Another great attribute is the fact that they have no debt on their balance sheet. Or the fact that 50% of their revenue is international, higher than most of their peers. Or that WIX is created in 10 different languages, and they have their own propriety payment platform.RisksThere are also some risks to make note of. The company currently has nearly 360 employees located in Israel. If a war does break out in the area, employees could be called into duty. This would most certainly effect operations of the business. In addition the company has yet to make any money. If the economy were to turn for the worse, the business could be negatively impacted. Lastly, the company still has a large amount of shares outstanding which can be used to dilute current holders. This was accounted for in our analysis, however this would hurt the stock in the short term.Conclusion:After all that I hope you understand exactly what WIX is. In my view it is an unknown gem trading below the $1b mark. While the stock is volatile, I think the market opportunity is huge. In addition, with no debt and an enterprise value of nearly $600 million, this could be acquired from someone like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).You can move into this stock into two ways. My first choice is take a stake in the company. For others, you can go out and sell put options well below today's price ($17.69). This will allow for you to potentially get in if the stock has downside volatility."
2452665,61281,2014-08-26T17:17:58-04:00,"Wix reported Q2’14 financials with record high revenues, beating analysts' expectations.Registered users to premium subscribers conversion rate is slightly down quarter-over-quarter, and after a peak in Q1'14, it returns to a 2013 level of 3%.Wix announced a partnership with Google with Google Domains, targeted to take market share from GoDaddy and increase revenues.Wix introduced a new hotel reservations feature that marks a change in the way Wix thinks and can encourage many new premium users.","Web development platform Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) reported its Q2 2014 financial results at the beginning of August with record high revenues and small improvements in operating and net profit margins. The company showed a quarterly revenue of $33.9M, which is an 18% increase quarter-over-quarter and 82% increase year-over-year and beat analysts' revenues expectations by 6.5%. Although Wix's revenue increase quarter-over-quarter is in the double digits, the company still remains in start-up mode as total expenses (operating expense and cost of revenue) increase even higher and drive the company to an operating loss. As shown in chart 1 below, in Q2 2014 Wix slowed down the increase in operating loss and presented an operating margin of -40%, which is 10 percentage points better than Q1 2014, but 16 points worse than Q2 2013.In an earlier article, I presented Wix's conversion rate that represents the quarterly rate in which Wix users switch from registered users' status to premium subsections. As shown in chart 2 below, Wix's conversion rate (in gray) in Q2'14 decreased by 2 percentage points compared to Q1'14. However, excluding the peak of Q1 2014, the Q2 2014 conversion rate is back to the 2013 level of around 3% and continues the upward trend.At the earnings release, Wix presented the previously announced Wix-Google partnership with Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Domains. The partnership is targeted at GoDaddy and expected to generate additional revenues to Wix for its web development tools and allow Google to gain substantial market share in the domains market that is currently dominated by GoDaddy. In an earlier article about Google Domains, I mentioned that the hidden strategic benefit Wix has from the Google partnership, on top of the potential revenues, is the impact on GoDaddy from Google's move. Wix's biggest competitors in the web building market are GoDaddy, Weebly and Squarespace, and with GoDaddy losing market share to Google in the domains segment, it will also lose market share in the site creation segment and will pose less of a threat to Wix.Another announcement that Wix made in the earnings release might be more meaningful to its future. Wix introduced a new hotel reservations feature, named WixHotels, which marks a change in the way Wix is thinking. Until recently, Wix has offered a one-size-fits-all web development platform. Using that platform, every small business owner or individual can create a custom-made website according to their wills using the same general tools available for every user. Wix offered different templates and even tailor-made designs, but the development tools were the same for every site in every business in every market, and frankly, it might be too simplistic for some businesses.Wix identified a problem in the online reservations market that could resolve and attract new paying customers to use its platform. WixHotels will allow small hotels or travel agencies to accept and manage reservations through the Wix platform and free them from offering their deals in the various online reservations services. The new WixHotels feature will encourage small hotels and travel agencies to create their platform instead of using a third-party aggregator to display their offers. That way, small hotels and travel agencies could save commission dollars, control the content better, and interact directly with potential clients. WixHotels has real potential in encouraging small hotels and travel agencies to become premium users in order to reduce their dependency on the big online reservation sites. If this new feature is successful in bringing new premium users, Wix will have a bigger challenge - to identify a new market that could benefit from a unique feature that could drive revenues in the future.ConclusionsWix proved it could generate revenues and increase its user base every quarter. However, it is still in rapid growth mode, and the constant increase in expenses drives the operating loss. The partnership with Google presents an opportunity for Wix not only to gain additional revenues as a development platform for domains purchased through Google Domains, but also to take market share from GoDaddy. The new WixHotels feature marks a change in the way of thinking from a one-size-fits-all to dedicated solutions for specific markets. Small hotels and travel agencies that want to reduce their dependency in the large reservations sites could use Wix to create their site and interact directly with their potential clients. Because of the structure of the travel market, this feature has a real potential to succeed, and Wix will have the challenge to identify another market that it could offer a dedicated solution to attract premium users.I still believe Wix is a solid, small-cap long-term investment for the technology portfolio. However, investors should pay attention to the fact that Wix stock is highly unstable. The stock completed an almost 50% drop since it hit an all time high price of $31 only four months after it went public with a $16.5 IPO price. Investors looking for a short-term investment horizon should use options to defend their investment from the stock's high volatility."
2549825,40031,2014-10-10T07:15:00-04:00,Wix has been delivering strong revenue growth in the last couple of years while incurring losses.The company is investing heavily in R&D and marketing to boost the growth of its platform.Recent initiatives should boost conversion rates and accelerate revenue growth.Current valuation leaves room for significant upside in the following years.,"Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) has traded in a volatile fashion since going public in November 2013. The stock is trading slightly above its IPO price and is down almost 50% from its February highs. The company has managed to grow revenues considerably in the last couple of years, and the growth rates have been consistently high along the way. Future expectations continue to trend higher, and further downside should be limited, while the potential upside in the following years should be significant. Recent fundamental trends are encouraging, and the company seems to have more positive surprises in store in the next couple of quarters. I am initiating Wix with a buy rating and a conservative price target of $26 and I believe that the potential upside in the bullish case scenario might be north of 100% in the next two to three years.Freemium business model leads to substantial growthWix is one of the leading global web development platforms with a large number of registered users. The company has been pioneering an approach to web development that provides an easy-to-use cloud-based platform that eliminates the need for complex coding and supplants expensive design services. Wix essentially operates under a ""freemium"" business model. The company is offering its basic services to users for free, and users can upgrade to premium subscription, which provides additional solutions such as extra bandwidth and storage, Wix ad removal, access to Google Analytics, domain connectivity and eCommerce solutions. The evidence of success can be seen in the company's revenue growth in previous years. Revenue has grown from $9.8 million in 2010 to $80.4 million in 2013 and is expected to continue to grow at a fast rate in the next couple of years. The company is employing an aggressive growth strategy that includes growing its user base, developing new solutions, investing in product development and expanding to underserved geographic markets.However, the company has incurred significant losses as it invests aggressively in R&D and marketing in order to grow its user base and offer more compelling products to its customers. But the business model itself enjoys a high gross margin profile, and the company is targeting an EBITDA margin above 30%, but we are not going to get close to these margins anytime soon because the company will continue to invest aggressively to gain market share and diversify its product offerings.Future growth potential underestimatedI have reason to believe that analyst estimates for the rest of 2014 and 2015 are quite conservative and that upward estimate revisions should be one of the drivers for a higher share price in the following months. The company also guides its expectations conservatively and its own guidance should be raised along the way. Wix has managed to beat revenue expectations in all three quarters since going public, and the revenue beat was between $1.3 million and $2 million. The company initially guided FY 2014 revenue between $127 million and $130 million in Q4 2013, and has subsequently raised its guidance to $130 million to $133 million in Q1 2014 and to $136 million to $138 million in Q2 2014. Analyst consensus has moved up in the meantime, and currently stands at $137.2 million, which is slightly above the mid-range of management guidance. In the table below, you can see my own revenue estimates for 2014 and 2015 compared to analyst consensus.Source: Yahoo! Finance, Author's estimatesMy optimism is not just based on management's conservatism. The company has several initiatives that should have a positive effect on revenue growth in the following quarters:- Developing tailored products for small businesses across many vertical markets. The company announced in early August its first solution of this kind - WixHotels. This solution for hotel owners is intended to build a fully integrated reservation and booking engine, including room availability, details and pricing, inventory management and payments. All of this should be done in the Wix cloud and is fully adapted for mobile and affordable. Hotel owners can manage their customer lists on Wix's platform and leverage the data for marketing campaigns and promotions. The success of this initial solution should have a profound effect on the company's solutions in the future, and if it proves successful, it should be the driving force for the growth of other verticals.- Google domain partnership. In late June 2014, Google announced a launch of a domain registration service aimed at small businesses and Wix is one of Google's partners. Wix's web development platform should make connecting a domain to a new Wix website seamless. Management believes that Google Domain could be a meaningful and attractive acquisition channel. It is still early to see the results of this partnership, but Google should be able to generate a significant level of traffic and generate substantial growth of Wix's platform going forward.- Increasing conversion rates and user retention rates. The company is continually working on improving user retention and it has achieved higher retention with several product enhancements and launches over the last 12 months. The company's paid user base case grew 68% Y/Y in 2013 and 65% and 62% Y/Y in Q1 and Q2 2014 respectively, while the total user base grew 49% Y/Y in 2013 and 45% and 41% in Q1 and Q2 2014 respectively. These enhancements were intended to increase the functionality and improve user experience and this leads to higher conversion and retention rates. The company has also improved payment capabilities for users outside of the United States, which also has a positive effect on user conversion and retention.- Going after high growth international markets. Wix is focusing on international growth. Revenue outside of North America accounted for 48% of total revenue in the first half of 2014, compared to 29% in 2010, and this trend is expected to continue in the future. The company intends to take advantage of the international markets that are growing fast, and is making progress in Brazil and Latin America in general as well as in Europe. The company plans to further expand globally in the second half of 2014 and in 2015. One thing that is helping the cause is the language adaptation to specific markets. The translation efforts and improvement of non-English languages has helped the growth in international markets and has resulted in higher conversion and retention rates in these geographies. Further improvements and developments on the language front should result in faster penetration in specific geographic regions.In addition to these initiatives, management indicated on the Q2 conference call that the new products and product improvements that are planned to be released in the next couple of months should have a meaningful effect on conversion rates in the following quarters. All of these initiatives coupled with increasing R&D and marketing investments should result in continued strong revenue growth in the future and we should continue to see revenue guidance and estimates trending higher in the following quarters.Appixia acquisition and mobile growthGrowth in mobile is becoming an important issue for most companies, and Wix is particularly dependent on the growth in mobile. The company announced the acquisition of Appixia in March 2014, an Israeli company that enables users to build native mobile apps for Android and iOS without the need to code. The acquisition should allow Wix to go beyond mobile website building and to expand into the creation of mobile apps. Over 3.5 million mobile sites have been built using Wix mobile and Wix's App Market is experiencing strong growth with over 35,000 installations a day. The company is still working on integrating Appixia and has not yet made a product announcement, but there are a number of beta versions. This should be an important milestone for the company and a significant growth driver in the following years, as the rising use of smartphones should result in significant opportunities for Wix and its users.Valuation and price targetWix's valuation has contracted significantly in the last couple of months, but the stock seems to have found a footing around a TTM P/S ratio between 5.5 and 6. Given the expectations for continued strong growth in the following years, and my expectations for even higher growth than is currently anticipated by Wall Street analysts, I believe that further P/S ratio contraction should be limited and that we might even see some expansion in the following months. However, I will take a conservative stance and my base case price target is based on a 2015 P/S ratio of 5, which represents a 15% discount to the current P/S ratio. This translates into a $26 price target based on analyst estimates and a $28 price target on my own revenue estimates for 2015. The upside potential is between 55% and 66%. If we make a more bullish assumption with valuation expectations, the upside potential is north of 100%. If revenue growth continues to be above 50% in the following quarters (and it should), we might see the P/S ratio expanding to a 7 to 8 range. The upside potential based on analyst revenue estimates for 2015 is 110% to 140% and 130% to 165% based on my revenue estimates for 2015.Source: Yahoo! Finance, Wix earnings reportsDownside should be limited to 20% to 30% since further valuation contraction should be limited. A 30% correction in the share price brings Wix's 2014 P/S ratio below 3.5, while the 2015 P/S ratio would be around 2.4. This would make Wix very cheap if we take the high EBITDA margin potential into account.Risks and challengesThe most important risk for my long thesis is the competition. This field is highly competitive and dependent on innovation and keeping up with the latest technological trends. Wix's growth prospects might be adversely affected if some of its competitors lower their prices or if a more established company enters the market and offers more attractive solutions. However, Wix has been able to address user needs in the past and is investing heavily in research and development, and the company's R&D staff accounts for more than half of the total number of employees.Other risks include:- The growth of mobile. Wix might prove to be unsuccessful in growing its user base as the ascent of smartphones takes users to mobile apps rather than websites. The company is addressing this issue, and the Appixia acquisition is part of the efforts to go after the mobile app market. It remains to be seen if its strategy will prove as successful in the following years.- A deterioration of worldwide economic conditions might negatively affect the company's future growth rates, as they will most likely result in lower spending by small to medium-sized businesses that mostly employ Wix's premium solutions. The Russia-Ukraine crisis might negatively affect Wix's growth in Russia, as the company has established a strong presence there, and it might negatively affect the growth of other countries in Europe.- Failing to convert free users to premium users and the question of long-term margin goals. Wix's business model attracts a lot of free users and its conversion rates are quite low, although they are improving and should continue to improve in the following years. However, if the company is not able to drive higher conversion rates in the future, or if the conversion rates start to trend down (due to competitors which might have better offerings at lower prices), the company's long-term margin goal will certainly become unattainable. And since my valuation expectations are based on the company's long-term margin goals, it will be adversely affected in such a case, and my bullish thesis would prove to be incorrect. However, the recent trends and growth point to the other direction, but the situation needs to be monitored going forward.ConclusionWix is well positioned to benefit from the intense worldwide growth of the internet and creation of websites. The company has a strong product offering and the constant improvements and investments in research and development should have a positive effect on conversion and retention rates and should help the company grow its revenues and expand margins significantly in the following years. My $26 price target represents 55% upside from the current price, while the potential upside could be more than 100% in the more bullish scenario. The recent weakness in small cap stocks might have a negative effect on Wix's short-term price movement, but the company's growth and focus on improving conversion and higher profitability should make the lower prices a bargain for long-term investors."
2011221,55382,2014-02-12T11:20:00-05:00,,"Executive summary:_________________________________Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX) is an Israeli company based in Tel Aviv. Many times, I have walked past its headquarters, which are located in the Tel Aviv port district. I heard the name Wix for the first time a couple of years ago, from a friend of mine who was starting a bakery business and had a very good feedback on the Wix platform as he tried to build his site. From then on, I kept hearing from people who were using Wix to build their websites, most of which were for their already existing small businesses. Taking my cue from the legendry investor Peter Lynch (who believes in taking advantage of any information you have about a product/service success long before the Wall St. guys become aware of that success), I waited for a Wix IPO. That IPO came about two years later, on November 6, 2013. Since the IPO, the stock price has risen from $16.30 to $28, a 72% increase. I firmly believe that this increase is just the beginning of a multi-year growth story. I'd like to present you with everything you need to know about Wix's business and the tools to evaluate it. Before we start talking about Wix's business, I'd like to go through the product itself. I think that, as with any business you invest in, it is crucial to understand why the business is growing and what factors you need to gauge to monitor the business growth. To do so, one has to understand the product.What Is Wix?Wix is a platform for building websites. Wix focuses on simplicity, meaning that the platform is meant to enable everyone, even people who don't have any experience in building websites or coding, with the tools to build his or her own website. Wix enables you to create a website with a very professional look that is very customizable. You can choose a template from a list of hundreds of website templates, and then you can start tinkering with it as you wish. Editing the template and changing anything on it does not involve any technical knowledge. The whole process is done by a simple drag & drop interface, which, I suspect, even a very unskilled individual, one who uses his or her computer only for random internet browsing, can manage.Wix enables the user to create a website that looks and functions like a website that a professional website designer made. The fast evolution of the Internet has brought new and complex websites. Today's user expects any website to be friendly, socially integrated, easy to navigate in, and of course, it has to be accessible through a mobile device (smartphone/tablet). Here is a cool visualization that Wix made about the evolution of websites over the past 5-6 years.Source: Wix's latest IR presentationNow, all of the features above (search box, contact form, a Google Map, E-Commerce product list) can be chosen from the Wix Editor and then dragged to the desired spot on your website page. To keep things simple and save you from going through the platform yourself, I have posted a couple of screenshots from the Wix Editor.Let's say I want to add a social bar to my website that will enable visitors to my site to go to my FB page, follow me on Twitter, etc. I go to the ""add"" menu, and choose ""Social Bar.""And then I can just drag the bar to my desired spot. All that is left to do is adding the links to my FB/Twitter/Google+ pages.As you see, the platform is highly intuitive. You can tinker and change your website with endless functions and widgets. Prior to Wix, you had to go to one of the other options to build your site, a professional designer or a cheap template service. Both of these options are either high cost, or offer limited design control.You can easily optimize your website for mobile access with an automatic feature, after which you can make any changes you want in the same way you did on the Wix editor. In my opinion, this mobile feature is one of the most important features a small business must incorporate into its website. We all know how annoying it is to try and navigate in a mobile-noncompatible website with our mobile phones. Most users will just give up and leave the website, which could mean lost revenues for a SMB owner.The Customer ChoiceLet's step in the shoes of a potential customer. Let's say we are ""Dial-a-Dumpster"" (the imaginary company from the template I used above). We are an old-fashioned small business and we understand that we have to own a website to connect with customers. What are our options?Our first option is the ""old way."" We would look for a website designer, tell him what website we need, and he would start building it with HTML5. At the end of the day we get a website to which we can make hardly any changes (because we lack coding knowledge), plus we need to maintain it (make ongoing changes as our business changes, e.g., add another service area to the map as our dumpster operation grows). All of that costs us $10K-$20K, which is not a negligible expense for a small business.Or, we could use the Wix platform. We could enjoy all of the features as with the ""old way,"" but this time we can do it ourselves. The cost would be $100-$140/year, which is substantially lower than the other option. On top of that, we would have full control over our website, and we would be able to make any changes we want, by ourselves.I believe that the value proposition that the Wix platform offers will bring many potential customers facing the dilemma above to choose Wix as their preferred website-building solution.The MarketWix is active in the website-building market. According to Netcraft, there were more than 920M websites in the world in February 2014. The number of websites is rapidly growing, and the growth is accelerating.Source: Netcraft.com. The numbers are in millions and refer to host names; according to Netcraft less than 25% of hostnames are active websites.While it's tricky to count the number of new sites created in any given year, we do know the number of host names and the number of active sites in any given month, thanks to the Netcraft survey. While the number of host names approaches the 1B mark, the number of active websites was 179.8M in February of 2014. Let's examine the active website numbers:Source: Netcraft web server survey February 2014. Years are 2001, 2002, and so on.The Wix IR presentation includes the hostname figure as the actual size of the market. As we can't know what is the actual ""new website"" figure, just the net figure (new websites minus expired domains), we can't actually figure out the market size. We do know that the number of new hostnames was 227M in 2013. If we take 20% as the percentage of active new sites from the new hostnames, we arrive at 45.4M new websites in 2013. At a $120 average annual subscription price, I estimate Wix has a TAM of $6B.It is important to understand no one actually knows how many new websites went online, but, by being careful we could figure out that the size of Wix's TAM is in the neighborhood of $6B.Wix created 397,319 websites in 2012; there is no reason to think that Wix has even started to scrape the surface of its potential TAM. Even if we don't know exactly how many new websites are created each year, that number is in the tens of millions, which leaves plenty of room for growth at Wix.Another staggering figure is that more than half of American SMB owners don't have a website, according to Yodle, while Wix and AMI partners believe that figure to be 75% world-wide. Any way we spin it, Wix's market is huge.Wix User BaseWix has been growing its user base rapidly in the past few years. The business model is fairly simple.Users register to the site, then they can design their own website for free. After which, if they want to publish their website, they can experience a free trial for two weeks. The user can publish the website using his own domain or purchase a domain directly from Wix. Wix actually offers users a free domain for 1 year if the user purchases certain plans. The Wix App Market offers various plug-ins for your website (like shopping carts, forms, etc.). Let's crunch some numbers to analyze Wix's user base.Source: Wix Prospectus.As you can see for yourself, Wix has been growing its user base quite rapidly for the past 11 quarters. The company is consistently adding new users. The most important category, Premium User, is actually enjoying accelerated growth.As of the last quarter, the company had 1.82% of premium users out of its registered user base. The ratio started to climb beginning in Q3-12 when the growth of premium users outpaced the growth of the registered users.Y/Y Growth RatesGrowth is calculated in comparison to the same quarter figure in the last year.The number of new users added in comparison to the last quarter.We get a pretty solid picture. Although the new users of Wix in each quarter varies a bit, the trend is a steady but positive growth rate in respect to the new registered users and a healthy and very high growth rate in respect to the new premium users.To conclude this section, I believe that Wix's user base will continue to show solid growth. The numbers prove that the platform provides value to the users; more and more users are signing up to a premium plan, and I don't think we need to doubt that this trend will continue.MonetizationAs a business, all of the above will mean nothing without a strong monetization mechanism. Let's examine the amount of revenue Wix is able to get from each premium subscriber on average.ARPPU stands for Average Revenues Per Premium UserThese numbers are encouraging. In the past 11 quarters, Wix has managed to grow the ARPPU figure by 8%-10% Y/Y. I believe this comes from continuous improvements in the monetization process at Wix, combined with a continuous increase in the value proposition (the Wix App Market, for example).A good sign for Wix's ability to convert registered users to premium ones is the next slide:The slide above shows how many of Wix's premium users went active that originated from certain cohorts. In this slide, Wix took the users that registered in the first quarters of 2010 through 2013, and showed how many premium users signed up from that base and when they signed up. We can clearly see that the same pattern applies for the last four years. Even 15 quarters after the Q1-10 registrees' user base was added, premium users were still signing up. This is a sign that the Wix platform offers long-standing value to its users. Another important figure is that 58% of the premium subscriptions (in September 2013) originated from direct and organic traffic. That means that most of the users reach Wix through word-of-mouth, and Wix doesn't heavily rely on aggressive methods of customer acquisition.The next image shows the exact numbers of the Q1-2010 user cohort taken from the Wix prospectus.I'll assume that Wix management will continue to put an emphasis on monetization and that ARPPU will keep growing ~9% Y/Y.When To Expect Profits?My model suggests that we could see the company reach the breakeven point around Q4-2014. I expect the revenues in the coming years to be as follows:My Projections 2013-2016The EPS figure assumes no further dilution, as the company has started to generate positive cash flows. In 2017, I assume the company will start paying a 20% income tax.I expect this business to operate with an operating margin of about 30% over the long term. This requires management to manage expenses as the company grows. On an absolute basis, I expect OPEX to keep increasing year over year, but as revenues start to reach substantial levels, OPEX will decrease as a percentage of revenues.ValuationToday, Wix's market cap is $1B. This is 12.5 times my 2013 expected revenues figure. I'll take two approaches in valuing the company over the long term. In 2016, I expect the company to make $3.47 in EPS. The first approach is giving the company a PEG of 1, which will force a P/E of 30 in 2016. According to this approach, the company shares' fair value in 2016 will be $104. This is almost four times today's price level of ~$28. Even if you price in massive dilution-let's take 20%-the shares will be worth $83 or almost three times today's price.The second approach is looking at the revenue multiple, which is about 12.5 as of today. Even if the market revenue multiple will decrease to 8, when applied to 2016 revenues of $380M, we come up with a market cap of just over $3B, or almost $82/share.RisksConclusionIn conclusion, I think Wix could be one of the shining stars in the coming few years with solid growth, which should propel earnings and make this play a multi-bagger opportunity. I hope you have enjoyed my work and I look forward to your feedback.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in WIX over the next 72 hours.

2352615,61281,2014-07-29T11:20:24-04:00,Wix's stock price fluctuated sharply since its IPO last year.Wix’s conversion rate of users from the free plan to the premium plans increases.Collaboration with Google Domains is a strategic alliance that is expected to attract more users to use Wix’s services.Lower level of R&D and SG&A as percentages of revenue is a key milestone to improve operating margin.,"Wix (NASDAQ:WIX), an Israeli website creation platform, raised $127M in a successful IPO last November. The company offered 7.7 million shares at $16.5 each, the top of a $14.5-$16.5 price range that reflected a $750M market cap for the Israeli start-up. One month later, the underwriters of Wix's IPO published bullish opinions and price targets for the stock. As shown in Chart 1 below, underwriters' prices reflected a potential upside of 22% on average that ranges from 5% to 53%, an impressive return for a small sized micro-cap tech company from Tel-Aviv.Wix's stock price fluctuated considerably until it reached its all-time high of $31.32 in February 2014 and completed an 89% increase from its IPO price level. After hitting an all-time high, Wix's stock price declined sharply and lost 36% of its value, which stopped when the company withdrew its secondary offering.At the beginning of 2014, many Israeli tech companies filed for either initial offerings or secondary offerings, and Wix followed that trend and filed for a secondary offering at the end of March. In an earlier article published in April, I described a market sentiment of an Israeli tech bubble evolving in NASDAQ. Following that sentiment, Wix withdrew its secondary offering filing, and the stock price responded with a 10% increase as shown in point B in Chart 2 below. Shortly after that increase, GoDaddy (Pending:DADDY) filed for IPO, and Wix's stock price reacted with another correction that ended when the company reported Q1'14 results with a higher EPS and more revenues than expected. From that point, Wix's stock price increased 19% to below $18, far from the underwriters' price targets.Business AnalysisWix operates in a Freemium business model in which registration to the website and essential web services such as a website creation platform and minimal storage are free, but Wix will display ads on your site. The premium plan includes more advanced features such as domain registration, ample storage, large bandwidth, mailbox, option to connect an external domain to Wix platform, and no external ads on the website.At the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2014 Global Technology Conference held in San Francisco in June, Wix presented slides that show the impressive increase Wix had in the total number of users and premium subscriptions to Wix services from Q1'11 to Q1'14. In its presentation, the company showed that as of Q1'14, premium subscriptions are only 2% of Wix registered users. This is not very impressive and may be alarming until you take a look at the conversion rate of users from the free plan to the premium plans.As shown in chart 3 below, since Q412, the company's increase quarter-over-quarter in the number of premium subscriptions (orange line) is higher than the increase quarter-over-quarter in the number of total users (blue line), which means that more and more registered users convert their free plan to a premium plan. The rate of conversion from free to premium plans that is reflected in the gray line in chart 3 below increases regularly from Q211 and has a direct impact on the revenue increase the company had in the same timeframe.At the end of June, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) announced its domain registration services, named Google Domain. I covered the impact of that announcement on the web services market in an earlier article; however, one thing is worth mentioning again. Google Domains is a big threat for GoDaddy, which mainly offers domain registration services, but also offers web creation tools that compete with Wix. Google Domain offers Wix as one of the platforms to create a website after a domain is registered through its new service. This collaboration is expected to attract additional users to register to Wix services. Users that register a domain and don't look for free domain names available will probably use premium services offered by Wix. Impact of that move will not be reflected in Q2'14 earnings release but should have a positive impact on Wix's financials in Q3'14 and on.In the paragraphs above, I described catalysts for revenues increase; however, Wix is still losing money. At the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2014 Global Technology Conference I mentioned above, Wix's executives presented a table that relates to that. That table can be seen in chart 4 below and discusses the level of R&D and SG&A the company targets. Wix's gross margin is increasing year-over-year to 82% level in Q1'14, which is a reasonable figure for a software company like Wix; however, its operating profit is negative driven from high levels of R&D and SG&A. In that table, Wix shows its intention to keep reducing its operating expenses in order to get closer for a positive operating profit. Once Wix shifts from an operating loss to operating profit, the company can start looking at how to improve its earnings.ConclusionsWix's stock fluctuated considerably since its IPO last year, and the current price is way below underwriters' price targets. Wix's operating figures are good, and the company presents an increasing number of registered users and increasing conversion rate to premium subscriptions. Google's entrance to the domain market and collaboration with Wix should attract users to use Wix premium services. The company targets to improve its operating profit by reducing levels of R&D and SG&A as percentages of revenue. Wix has a great potential and an impressive possible upside that makes it a buy for long-term investment.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The number of websites have quadrupled over the last five years. The influx of mobile devices has also created the need for websites that can cater to mobile operating systems. Additionally, today, consumers demand a higher level of customization and functionality from a website.Wix's OfferingsIsrael-based Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) was founded by Avishai Abrahami, Nadav Abrahami and Giora Kaplan in 2006 to simplify the process of website publishing for all users. It has successfully implemented the DIY model to become one of the largest website creation platforms on the Web. Today, the company offers an easy-to-use, cloud-based platform that enables more than 42 million users across 190 countries to use visual aids and editing tools and create websites, as well as complicated web businesses. Best of all, users can create these pages without possessing any coding skills.The core product utilizes the drag-and-drop tool, and comes with a media gallery that includes web page templates, graphics, image galleries and fonts. The tool lets users customize their websites for most browsers, as well as desktop, tablet and mobile devices. Wix also has a curated App Market that offers a choice of over 170 free and paid apps to embed on websites using a simple select-and-click process.Wix's FinancialsWix operates on a freemium model, allowing individuals and small businesses to open their basic portals for free and additional features are available for purchase. Pricing varies from $4.08 a month to $24.90 a month depending on the storage, bandwidth, support and advertisement capabilities demanded by the user. Of the 40 million users worldwide, a mere 790,000 are paying customers. But that hasn't stopped Wix's revenue growth. The company has delivered 16 consecutive quarters of revenue growth so far. However, the company is yet to turn in profits.Revenues have grown from $9.9 million in 2010 to $80.5 million in 2013.Wix recently reported fourth-quarter and full-year 2013 results. Fourth-quarter revenue grew 88% over the year to $24.9 million, with premium subscriptions growing 68% to 790,000. Losses have started to narrow, and the company ended the quarter with a loss of $0.45 per share, compared with a loss of $0.63 per share reported a year ago.For the full-year 2013, revenue grew 84% to $80.5 million and the net loss was $3.33 per share, compared with $2.71 per share a year ago.For the current quarter, Wix expects revenues of $26 million-$27 million, with a loss of $13 million-$14 million. The company is projecting to end the year with revenues of $127 million-$130 million and an adjusted EBITDA of a loss of $38 million-$42 million.Till November last year, Wix was venture-funded, with $58.5 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, Mangrove Capital Partners, Benchmark and Insight Venture Partners. Last November, it went public on the Nasdaq under the ticker WIX, and raised $127.05 million by selling 7.7 million shares at $16.50 each. This was the largest-ever IPO for an Israel-based firm since the 2010 listing of SodaStream International (NASDAQ:SODA).Wix's Mobile InitiativesDuring the recent quarter, Wix also released a new mobile solution. Given the importance of mobile Internet usage, the company is delivering more mobile-based offerings. The mobile solution allows users to customize the mobile website without editing the desktop version. Since its launch, the company has seen more than 1.6 million mobile sites created on the platform.Wix's stock is trading at $26.56, with a market capitalization of $670.35 million. It touched a high of $32.69 last month."
1857301,21136,2013-11-22T08:47:26-05:00,,"On Saturday, November 30, the 25 day quiet period on underwriter research subsequent to the November 5 IPO of Wix.com (NASDAQ:WIX), a global provider of web presence solutions for SMB's, will come to an end. With the expiration of the quiet period, the IPO underwriters will be allowed to release research reports to the market, which will likely result in at least a short-term rise in the price of WIX shares.The stock initially priced at $16.50 per share, and has since held fairly steady with fluctuations between $16.19 and $18.90, closing at $18.30 on November 21.The underwriters, including J.P. Morgan, BofA Merrill Lynch, RBC Capital Markets, Needham & Co, and Oppenheimer & Co, will attempt to boost the stock's price with a release of positive research reports at the close of the quiet period.The past two years of our research efforts and recent academic studies have provided empirical evidence of a correlation between the quantity and visibility of IPO underwriters and increased share prices at the closing of the quiet period. Prices typically will start to rise a few days before the quiet period expires, as savvy investors begin to purchase shares under the assumption that the underwriters will only release positive research reports; these investors realize that there would be little reason for an underwriter to release a negative report on a firm it recently underwrote. These early stock buys generate the perception of increased demand and push prices up as the quiet period nears expiration.BUSINESSAs a provider of web development services for SMB's, WIX stands to benefit tremendously from the huge numbers of websites being created around the globe. A recent survey from Netcraft found 767 million total websites, four times the number of sites found five years ago. This trend is unsurprising, as websites have come to be considered essential for most businesses. Perhaps because of this necessity, WIX faces extreme competition from similar website developers.Powerful competitors like Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) are much better capitalized and have access to far greater resources than WIX. WIX also faces competition from free and open-source tools like Drupal, KompoZer, and WordPress.MANAGEMENTAvishai Abrahami co-founded WIX and served as the Co-CEO since 2006; he became sole CEO in September 2010. Mr. Abrahami previously served as Arel Communications & Software's Vice President of Strategic Alliances.CONCLUSIONWix.com has performed reasonably well in the market thus far, and certainly does have some appeal due to constantly growing demand for its services, so the upcoming bump from the quiet period expiration may be a good time to own part of the WIX business by becoming a shareholder.Disclosure: I am long WIX.

The full IPO calendar can be found at IPOpremium.F-1 filed October 23, 2013.Manager, Joint managers: J.P. Morgan/ BofA Merrill Lynch/ RBC Capital Markets.Co-Managers: Needham & Co., Oppenheimer & Co.SummaryWIX is a leading global web development platform with one of the largest number of registered users in the world.Through September 30, 2013, WIX achieved 15 consecutive quarters of sequential growth in the accumulated number of premium subscriptions. WIX also achieved 15 consecutive quarters of growth in revenues and collections.ValuationAccumulated deficit of -$78 million.GlossaryConclusionThe rating on WIX is a buy on the IPO. Registered and paid subscribers are on an upswing, the revenue model is recurring subscription-based and WIX just turned free cash flow positive for the nine months ended September 2013.To put the conclusions and observations in context, the following is reorganized, edited and summarized from the full S-1 referenced above:BusinessWIX is a leading global web development platform with one of the largest number of registered users in the world.As of September 30, 2013, WIX had almost 39 million registered users and 706,780 premium subscriptions and averaged 20,595 app installations per day during the month of September.As of September 30, 2013, 64% of WIX's overall premium subscriptions were annual and 36% were monthly.How WIX generates revenueWIX derives the substantial majority of revenue from monthly and annual premium subscriptions. Annual subscriptions provide benefits to the operating model because WIX is able to collect cash up front, increase overall retention rates and have greater visibility into revenues.WIX has noticed, however, that promotions that further lower the effective price of an annual subscription can result in attracting users who do not renew their subscription once the promotion is no longer available.WIX therefore seeks to strike a balance between attracting annual subscriptions and maintaining a user base that is loyal to WIX's offering.User Acquisition Spending58% of the premium subscriptions generated by users that registered in September 2013 came from organic and direct sources, meaning visitors that reached WIX via unpaid search results or by typing the URL of WIX's website in their browser.Geographic breakdownFor the nine months ended September 30, 2013, the geographic customer breakdown was: North America, 55%; Europe, 24%; Latin America, 11%; Asia and others, 10%.Core ProductWIX's core product is a drag-and-drop visual development and editing environment complete with high quality templates, graphics, image galleries and fonts. With its platform, WIX users can create and manage a professional-quality digital presence tailored to their brands' specific look and feel, accessible across all major browsers and the most widely used desktop, tablet and mobile devices.WIX's cloud-based platform is accessed through a hosted environment, allowing its users to update their site and manage their business or organization at any time. WIX provides its users with flexibility and scalability, allowing them to expand their digital presence as their business, organizational, professional or individual needs change and grow.WIX's scale and reach makes it an attractive partner for companies interested in distributing their own solutions to WIX's users, which are primarily small business owners, organizations and entrepreneurs. As WIX expands its platform through partnerships, WIX is able to increase its value proposition for existing users and more easily attract new users.App MarketThrough its highly curated App Market, which WIX launched in the last quarter of 2012, WIX offers users the ability to easily install more than 140 different apps that were carefully identified and selected for inclusion in the App Market based on user needs and demand. These apps add additional functionality and are easily integrated into users' websites with one click and without any coding.Revenues from WIX's App Market have been negligible to date.CompetitionWIX believes that it does not compete with traditional web development firms because WIX focuses on not only web development but also technology, design and business work flow processes.Nevertheless, WIX does compete with aspects of the services provided by web-based website design platforms and software programs as well as some of the service offerings of a number of smaller template-based web builder companies and designers, as well as those who offer domain registration services, particularly using a freemium business model similar to WIX.For example, Squarespace5% stockholders pre-IPOEntities affiliated with Mangrove Capital Partners, 27%Entities affiliated with Bessemer Venture Partners, 26%Benchmark Capital Partners, 13%Entities affiliated with Insight Venture Partners, 12%Use of proceedsWIX expects to net $76 from its IPO, from sale of 5.5 million shares.

1801092,20108,2013-11-04T05:39:31-05:00,,"The DIY site builder is financing its way through massive profitless growth - but has a plan for profits.DIY website builder Wix (NASDAQ:WIX) plans a $100+ million IPO on the NYSE this week, with proposed pricing that values the business at around $700 million. This will be the highest profile New York IPO for an Israeli tech company in some time, and by far the largest consumer internet IPO among the new wave of Israeli product and design focused startups.In October Wix filed its F-1 (now amended), pulling back the kimono on its financials for the first time. Everyone knew Wix had raised a boatload of VC money - $40 million in its 2011 Series D alone - and that it's been spending gobs of it on marketing, but until now nobody knew just how effectively the cash had been deployed.Jumping right to the bottom line: the company lost $15 million last year, and is on track to lose over $20 million in 2013. Proceeds from the IPO will allow Wix to continue its marketing-heavy user acquisition model, which means ongoing losses for the time being.But of course if you buy this IPO, you expect Wix to break out of its current model and begin generating significant free cash flow at some point in the future. How likely does that appear given the current business? Let's try to figure that out with a few key charts and figures from Wix's own roadshow presentation.Wix's high marketing spend, coupled with its very solid product for SMBs, has fueled strong registered user growth. This in turn drives steady growth in premium subscriptions (Wix runs a freemium model):Regarding those blue bars, Wix acknowledges in the F-1 that it has no idea how engaged its non-premium users are, as ""some users may never publish a website, but have not cancelled their registration. Even if [user engagement] were measurable, we do not consider the level of engagement of our registered users to be material to our business."" That's surprising, as it makes comprehensive churn analysis impossible. Wix can only assess churn of premium subscribers, which is relatively high - it reports that over 35% of paid users don't renew for a second year.In any case, those premium subscriptions have produced strong top line numbers, though revenue growth has decelerated to around 80% year over year:Break the marketing spend into cohorts and you see that a Wix marketing dollar pays for itself relatively quickly. The strongest example of this came from early spend. The company says the $1 million it dropped on marketing in Q1 2010 has already generated over $11 million in realized and deferred revenue from that cohort:This cohort analysis helps toward defining the all-important lifetime value (LTV) of a Wix user, and shows the beauty of a recurring revenue model for a high margin hosted app business like Wix's. Here's a nice visualization of that - new paying users according to year of origination:The pattern is clear: Each year's marketing spend generates a burst of new premium subscriptions, and Wix then enjoys some late conversion that forms a rising base for subsequent years.That translates into a growing proportion of Wix's current income derived from subscriptions initiated in previous years - a good trend for the business:Now here's the money slide, presenting the company's long-term plan toward profitability:That third row for 'S&M' indicates that Wix currently pays $0.66 in marketing (they have no sales team) for each $1 of revenue it generates. In its effort to reach positive cash flow, it plans to pull marketing spend back to just 28 cents on the revenue dollar, while slashing R&D costs as well.The company doesn't put a timeline on this, but you can bet that big institutional investors being pitched on the deal right now are demanding details.The bull case: Wix can safely pull back on marketing spend when it has a large enough free and paying user base, has significantly reduced churn, and effectively upsells premium users on new, more lucrative products. It's a huge market for SMB websites - and still largely untapped.The bear case: Wix hasn't demonstrated its independence from high marketing spend for customer acquisition, and without ongoing strong user growth the whole model breaks down. LTV may appear high, but CPA will continue to rise over time and squeeze any profitability out of it.Currently Wix - like Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) (Wix is no doubt trying to draft off Twitter's big upcoming IPO) is financing its way through massive profitless growth. This strategy can work just fine as long as investors support management's vision of future value creation. As Jeff Bezos demonstrates, that can be a long time if you make the case well. But make no mistake: as Ben Horowitz recently noted, a company in this framework doesn't fully control its own destiny. It cedes control to those investors, and can continue along this path only as long as its institutional investors allow it to.Right now the private and public markets are smiling on this model for consumer internet companies (for an extreme example, see Pinterest's recent financing), so Wix's IPO will likely go through without a hitch. But when investor sentiment changes - and it absolutely will at some point - Wix management will probably want to be well along the path toward profits if it doesn't want to see its stock swoon."
1952021,52382,2014-01-18T11:05:10-05:00,,"Wix.com Limited (NASDAQ:WIX) stock, after an uneventful IPO, has risen by more than 50% in the last few weeks. Bullish investors are banking upon continuation of strong revenue growth rates. They have high hopes that this ""cloud"" story with high gross margins would eventually start generating profit and justify the current high valuations.There are broader concerns around the DIY (Do-It-Yourself) website building tools market in general and Wix in particular that may act as negative catalysts in the coming weeks and quarters. Some of these areThe stock, which is trading at more than 13 times sales and 16 times book value, has not fully reflected these concerns and may correct as the name gets more coverage on the street.What is Wix?Wix.com is an online DIY (Do-It-Yourself) website building platform to build websites most helpful for individuals and small-medium businesses, which require just a few pages with limited advance level functionality. The platform, with its drag and drop development functionality, is renowned for its ease of use.The company, with 39 million registered users and more than 700,000 premium subscribers, has a dual pricing model. The platform is free for very basic website hosted on Wix and charges different subscriptions for different level of functionalities.DIY platforms have shortcomings for the fast changing web development landscapeThe most promising feature of the platform is ""drag and drop"" functionality to design web pages, which is good for personal & small businesses to create their basic online presence but is limited in its ability to offer interactive content or dynamic processing. As the market matures, DIY website building platforms lose value as customers demand more functionality for their websites.As the market for low-end websites shifted from independent web developers to ready templates offered by DIY website building platforms, the company experienced decent growth along with the rest of the marketplace.Broader market can be segregated between platforms like Wordpress, who offer more sophisticated and vast number of tools via ""plugins"" created by independent developers and relatively simple DIY platforms like Wix, Weebly or Squarespace. Even though platforms like Wordpress require some basic level of coding knowledge, they offer a much higher scalability in terms of traffic and functional sophistication. Another limitation customers face with DIY tools like Wix is the limited integration with social networks and e-commerce tools.There are concerns around poor search optimization on the platformWix platform was initially built on ""Flash"" technology and later changed to HTML5. Even though the platform has changed, there have been constant concerns around poor Search Engine Optimization (SEO) of the websites built using Wix and other DIY website building platforms. Some of the common concerns areSince poor SEO affects the traffic flow from search engines, which is a major source of traffic for small businesses, it greatly affects the customer's choice in adopting these platforms. With increased traffic from search engines, poor SEO affects not just the more sophisticated web businesses but businesses of all sizes.Mobile and social network traffic growth to affect negativelyOnline traffic is moving to mobile in a big way and website owners are following them with more mobile optimized sites or Apps. This should pose a strong challenge to the growth of DIY website building platforms. Wix launched its updated mobile editor in October, which allows the customer to build a mobile specific site while keeping the desktop site intact on a single URL across the website's versions.The growth of ""Apps"" on mobile operating systems like iOS (AAPL) or Android (NASDAQ:GOOG) poses a serious threat as it does away with the need for mobile websites itself.Another challenge is about the rise of social networks, who are gaining an ever-larger share of SMB mindshare as the customers move to social platforms for information and reviews on small medium businesses. As customers spend more on social, they may spend a less amount on their websites.Registered user growth rate slowdown is a cause of concernAlmost 70% of the premium subscriptions in the last quarter were from conversion of new registered users of last 3 quarters and 42% of premium subscriptions are from same quarter's registered users so registered user growth is one of the leading indicators for the business.Raw data source: Wix prospectusLooking at the registered user growth rate of the last few quarters, decelerating growth rate is something worth watching closely.""App Market"" pick-up has failed to impress compared to Wordpress ""Widgets""With an eye on ever increasing need for websites to integrate and interact with third party tools & services, customers are asking for advanced functionality for their websites. One of the more popular ways has been integrating tools developed by third parties without using any advanced coding skills through ""Apps"" or ""Widgets"". Some of the popular needs are integrating social networks, distributing updates or adding e-commerce functionality.To counter competition and increased interest for advanced functionality, Wix launched its ""App Market"" in late 2012 but compared to hundreds of thousands ""Widgets"" on Wordpress it holds limited appeal with less than 200 ""Apps"". There are hardly any other DIY website building platforms who provide these services.From an analysis standpoint, even though Wix does not provide these Apps as part of their core services and intend to monetize them still Apps may not contribute any meaningful revenue for the next few years.This is a crowded space and pricing pressure may follow soonEven though there are hardly any publicly listed competitors, but the space is way overcrowded with limited product differentiation. Some of the more prominent solutions that compete very closely are Weebly, Squarespace, Jimdo and Webs (part of VPRT). Compared to major content management systems, analysis by W3Techs says a lot (chart below).Source: W3TechsPrice improvements have contributed to the revenue growth of the last few years, which may get affected by increasing competition and limited product differentiation among the DIY website building platforms.Breakeven seem far even with a high operating leverageA rough back of the envelope calculation (worksheet below) would lead us to a revenue break-even level of close to $30 million per quarter.Which seem a few quarters away even if the company continues the current pace of strong revenue growth and high gross margin structure. High operating cost structure is a big reason for the absence of profitability, as shown by the worksheet below.What's even worrisome is the trend of this operating cost structure.One need not look closely at the numbers to understand the absence of earnings leverage. Another interesting fact worth noting is the weak relationship between premium subscribers and registered user growth with the revenue growth, as shown by the worksheet above.Estimates seem conservative but not by muchOn the back of solid revenue growth of the last few years, bullish investors are expecting a quarter significantly better than street estimate, at least looking at the recent stock movement.If we run growth estimates against that of last year, it seems the numbers are definitely on the conservative side, but even if the growth rate hits that of last year's level, it might still be difficult for the company to impress on the earnings front.Risks to the short thesisSome risks worthy of consideration, especially while looking at the name as a potential short candidate.Few may include potential of take over as an added risk, but looking at the serious long-term concerns around DIY building tools market in general, I will be very surprised to see substantial premium from any large company at the current valuations.ConclusionQuestion mark over long-term growth of the market, high valuation and leading indicators of the business losing momentum, all suggest a reassessment of the bull-side thesis, which is primarily built upon revenue growth rate of the last few years.

Click here to find out more »Willis Towers Watson (WLTW) has just been granted a licence to operate in China. With expansion into new territory afoot for the recently-merged company, WLTW is showing underlying strength compared to competitors.Since the merger of Willis and Towers Watson in 2016, the combined company has gone from strength to strength.It was announced on 15th May that Willis Towers Watson has become the first global broker to be fully licensed to transact insurance business in China.To be the first foreign broker breaking ground in China is a huge competitive advantage.WLTW has been granted access to an insurance market in a country with more than 1.3 billion people. Further to this, the Chinese insurance landscape is highly concentrated at the moment. 50% of the market is controlled by just three players. The scope for a smaller player to break the mould is large.Foreign insurers make up just 6% of the Chinese market at the most recent count. Growth potential in this area is huge. Willis Towers Watson is primed to close this gap.Source: Aon's 2016 whitepaper on the Chinese Insurance MarketLooking at the overall landscape of the insurance market in China, we can see that the premium per capita is minuscule compared to more developed nations. It currently stands at less than 5% of the US premium. As China's economy grows and falls more in line with the G7, this premium should develop as well.We have seen China's insurance market boom since 2005 and before, growing from $60bn to $390bn in 2015. In addition to this, the Chinese insurance industry is forecast to grow at twice the rate of the overall Chinese economy. Some analysts have set a target of low double-digit annual growth until at least 2020.Furthermore, WLTW continues the integration further since the merger in 2016. This will lead WLTW to become greater than the sum of its parts due to leveraging its global distribution network and creating a unified platform.Diving deeper into their 10-K, it's immediately striking to see how much revenues have grown in such a short amount of time. While I don't want to surmise, it would be prudent to assume a 114% increase in revenue, over the course of two years, is in some way down to the combined resources which the unified firm now possess.Although the costly and time-consuming process of combining independent companies is no doubt a drag on management attention (they've identified this as a potential issue), WLTW has still performed well and grown significantly in its time as a single entity.As far as I can tell, WLTW, or the insurance industry as a whole, doesn't appear to have stand-out risk factors for its growth or general income. The main risks to WLTW are a general economic downturn or regulatory action.WLTW also has enough cash flow to service current debts ($4.5bn in debt compared to $8.2bn annual revenue and a healthy debt/equity of 0.43). In fact, the cash flow has increased substantially since merging. End of year cash and cash equivalents have increased from $532m in 2015 to $1.030 billion in 2017.While Jay Powell (Chairman of the Federal Reserve) hinted at a faster rise in interest rates earlier in his term, these fast rises in rates haven't materialized in practice.WLTW interest expense currently stands at $188m, which will rise incrementally as rates increase.Though a fast rise in rates won't break the bank for WLTW, the slower rise which we have seen from the Fed will benefit them, as they are given more time to consolidate and prepare for higher interest payments.A summary taken from their most recent financial reports:Moving to a price chart and some industry comparisons, we can see further reasons for bullishness.In terms of technicals, we can certainly see more than one reason to sit up. After breaking out of the 2015-2017 price value area, WLTW has continued its rise.Should buyers want to initiate positions, $132.34 to $125.66 is just the area to do so. Despite being nearly 16% below the current price, it is very likely buying will continue in this area.This price range was previously heavily traded, with the huge push out of the area showing a clear supply and demand imbalance.For the more impatient buyer, perhaps someone looking for a shorter-term investment, there's currently a momentum buy opportunity unravelling in this stock.Zooming in on the same weekly chart, we can see the ""fakeout"" of a recent strong low. Following this, last week was a very strong bullish week which has cleared a prior high (week of 16th April).This leads me to believe that anywhere between $152.56 and $148.76 will be a springboard for a move to a new all-time high. The highs of WLTW look extremely primed for a price probe. Any liquidity beyond those highs will be used for larger players to exit some of their positions.Comparing WLTW to the SPDR S&P Insurance ETF (NYSEARCA:KIE), we can see that WLTW is showing strength compared to its benchmark.KIE appears to be holding below its bull flag while WLTW has solidly rejected the bottom. This means that WLTW is stronger than its overall sector. This is further confluence for the momentum buy.Upon further comparison, we can see that the industry leader, AXA (CS), happens to be showing weakness.AXA has firmly rejected the interim highs at €26-€27, and moved down swiftly, including a large gap to a fresh low.This is more positive news for WLTW. Anyone looking to immediately rebalance their long-insurance portfolio sector should take a serious look at WLTW and what they can offer.Their expansion and first arrival into the growing Chinese market give them a large competitive advantage over their contemporaries.For the more passive value investor, there's a solid technical and fundamental case for buying if we get a 15-20% dip in price. Investments from the $132 area are shrewd, to say the least."
4103166,67775,2017-08-30T18:21:05-04:00,"Jeffrey Ubben, a board member of Willis Towers Watson, has sold a total of 2.6 million shares in August worth more than $400 million.While the stock is up 22% year-to-date, insiders appear to be taking some chips off the table.Comparing the company to its peer group offers an explanation for the insider selling and may point to limited upside in the stock going forward.","Jeffrey W Ubben, a board member of Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW), sold 311,000 shares of the company worth a total of $46.3 million on Monday, August 28th. Mr. Ubben has served as a Director of Willis Towers Watson since January 4, 2016. He is the Founder, CEO and Chief Investment Officer of ValueAct Capital. Through ValueAct, Ubben continues to hold 4,227,358 shares of Willis Towers Watson which is worth approximately $625 million.According to Market Beat, Mr. Ubben has sold roughly $400 million worth of Willis Towers Watson stock in the month of August alone (roughly 2% of the company's market capitalization).The company's shares last traded at $147.87 as of Tuesday, August 29, approximately 97.7% of its 52-week high. While the stock is up 22% year-to-date, Mr. Ubben appears to be taking some chips off the table. Could the recent insider transactions signal a troubling road ahead for shareholders?Willis Towers Watson operates as an advisory, broking, and solutions company worldwide. The company was formerly known as Willis Group Holdings Public Limited Company and changed its name to Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company in January 2016 - right when Mr. Ubben of ValueAct joined the board of directors.Analysts covering the stock often compare the company to a peer group that includes Aon plc (NYSE: AON), Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE: AJG), Marsh & McLennan Companies, (NYSE: MMC) and CNA Financial (NYSE: CNA). Analyzing Willis Towers Watson's valuation metrics and ratios provides further insight into why insiders may be selling their shares.We define fundamental metrics and present charts below that may help explain why insiders are selling their shares.Return on Equity (ROE) measures a company's profitability in relation to the book value of Shareholders' Equity. ROE is a measure of how effectively management makes investments to generate earnings for shareholders. It's calculated as Net Income / Average Total Equity. Willis Towers Watson's ROE of 4.5% is below all of its selected comparable public companies: AON (32.9%), AJG (11.8%), MMC (27.4%) and CNA (9.3%).Furthermore, Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) is used to evaluate the ability of a company to create value for all its stakeholders, debt and equity. It is calculated as NOPAT / Average Invested Capital where NOPAT is defined as Net Operating Profit After Tax. Notice in the above chart the company's ROIC of 2.8% is also well below all of its peers: AON (7.0%), AJG (4.4%), MMC (14.0%) and CNA (6.9%).Net Profit Margin is defined as Net Income/Total Revenue. All else equal, companies with higher profit margins command higher valuation multiples. However, Willis Towers Watson's net profit margin of 6.1% is below its entire peer group but its P/E multiple of 40.9x trades above this same peer group as illustrated below.Although the company's stock is up 22% year-to-date, shares are up only up 25% since August 2014. Additionally, the stock has hovered around the $145-$150 range over the last three months. Insiders may be trying to take some chips off the table while fundamentals appear stretched and the stock remains in a holding pattern.The fundamental charts above indicate that the company's stock may be trading at a premium and helps explain why insiders have been selling shares. Value investors long Willis Towers Watson may want to re-evaluate their positions."

The crux of their argument comes down to the fact that the value of the deal, based on share prices before the deal was announced, was a ~12% discount to where TW had been trading.Implied Synergies Don't Match RealityTo analyze this acquisition, we've created a synergy impact analysis visualizing this deal from both perspectives, either as Willis Group buying Towers Watson, or Towers Watson buying Willis Group. This analysis is possible since this an all-stock ""merger of equals.""What we find is that, if we visualize the deal from the perspective of Towers Watson buying Willis Group, it's paying a premium of $1.86/share or $321 million above market price. This scenario assumes estimated cost savings of $100-$120 million and potential tax savings from moving the headquarters to London of up to $80 million. We still see the synergies come up short, though not by that much.However, if we look at the deal the other way, as Willis Group buying Towers Watson, it becomes clear that Willis Group is getting, by far, the better end of the deal here. The purchase price implies negative synergies of $887 million, which seems bizarre because, as mentioned, Towers Watson's cash flows should easily improve after the merger due to the improved tax treatment, if nothing else.Business Strength Favors Towers WatsonThe discount that Willis Group is getting on Towers Watson shares in this merger is bad enough, but what also has investors frustrated is the fact that Towers Watson has been a much stronger business over the past few years. It doesn't make sense to many investors that Towers Watson would willingly give up so much value just to merge with what appears to be a weaker company.Figures 1 and 2 show the relative trends in after-tax profit (NOPAT) and return on invested capital (ROIC) for the two companies since 2010, when the merger of Towers, Perrin, Forster & Crosby with Watson Wyatt created Towers Watson in its present form.Figure 1: Towers Watson's Business Trending UpwardsSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsFigure 2: Willis Group's Business Trending DownwardSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsThese trends by and large look primed to continue. The human resources consulting and risk management sector is expected to record consistent growth over the next several years, while Willis Group's property & casualty business could face some significant pricing pressure. Among the positives for Towers Watson:Among the negatives for Willis Group:Given the relative trajectories of their businesses, it seems like Towers Watson should be the one getting Willis Group at a discount, and not the other way around.Economic Book Value Also Favors Towers WatsonThe final frustration for Towers Watson's investors is that they'll be getting a 49.9% stake in the combined company once the merger is complete. They'll also be getting a $4.87/share special dividend. While Towers Watson is being treated as more valuable than Willis Group, it's only by ~$300 million.Figure 3 shows the trends in economic book value for each company. We can see that, as of right now, Towers Watson has an EBV that is ~$300 million higher than Willis Group. However, we also see that economic book value is moving in the opposite direction for both companies.Figure 3: Towers Watson's Rising Economic ValueSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsTowers Watson Shareholders Are Losing OutThis is supposedly a ""merger of equals,"" yet as we see above, these two businesses are hardly equal at all. In addition, over the past five years, Towers Watson has a NOPAT CAGR of 12.5% compared to -6% for Willis Group. Given their current trajectories and future outlook, it doesn't seem to make much sense for Towers Watson shareholders to be getting a smaller stake in the combined company.Disclosure: David Trainer and Sam McBride receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, sector, style, or theme."
3956706,71675,2016-03-08T14:05:51-05:00,,"The use of longevity hedging instruments, such as swaps and reinsurance, is expected to grow in 2016, with longevity risk increasingly on the agenda for pension funds, while reinsurer appetite for assuming longevity risks remains strong, according to Willis Towers Watson (NASDAQ:WLTW).One of the signs of a healthy market in longevity swaps and risk transfer has been the availability and affordability of reinsurance capacity. Reinsurer appetite for assuming longevity risk has been strong and growing, keeping longevity risks largely out of the capital markets in recent years.Many large reinsurance firms remain over-weighted towards mortality risks, the risk that more deaths occur than forecast, meaning that assuming longevity risk as a natural hedge and balance to that mortality exposure has been increasingly attractive.By assuming and underwriting longevity risk, to balance the mortality exposure, reinsurance firms can optimize their capital use and lower reserve requirements, overall. Hence the appetite among reinsurers and large life insurers has been strong and driving the growth of the longevity risk transfer market.That growth is expected to continue in 2016, with forecast that £20 billion or more of longevity swaps will be transacted in 2016, despite a slower start to the year.Shelly Beard, senior de-risking consultant at Willis Towers Watson, explained; ""The prominence of longevity risk on schemes' agendas means that we are expecting to see continuing growth in longevity swap markets. 2014 saw deals covering £25bn of liabilities, including the record breaking £16bn hedge for the BT Pension Scheme. This flow of deals continued in 2015 with AXA (OTCQX:AXAHY), Heineken (OTCQX:HEINY) and a further deal for Aviva (NYSE:AV) - some £6bn of liabilities.""£20 billion or more of UK sourced longevity hedging in 2016 would be the second biggest year on record for the market. For the moment longevity risk transfer remains largely a UK and Netherlands phenomenon, with a few transactions seen in Canada and other European countries. Interest is growing in the U.S. and once that market recognises the risk of pensioners living longer and the additional liabilities that results in, its pension market is also expected to see some activity.""Based on the conversations we are having with our clients, it is likely that 2016 could see longevity-hedging deals covering over £20bn of liabilities. The range of structures available for accessing the demand for longevity risk in the reinsurance market means that longevity hedging is more affordable and flexible than ever,"" Beard continued.It is this strong demand for longevity risk from reinsurance companies that makes it a good time for pension funds to be looking at ways to offload their longevity risk. With more options available than ever before, transaction costs cheaper, more efficient structures available and more experience among brokers and facilitators, the longevity risk hedging market seems destined for growth.Willis Towers Watson warns that demand for longevity reinsurance capacity could also rise, thanks to the new Solvency II capital requirements. Bulk-annuity providers may find themselves compelled to look to transfer our longevity risk, through swaps and reinsurance, in order to improve their capital positions.This increased Solvency II driven demand for longevity reinsurance capacity could result in capacity and resource constraints, potentially meaning that ""pension schemes find it more difficult to get traction when reinsurers have limited resources,"" Willis Towers Watson explained.However Beard said that any impact to the market is expected to be minimal, explaining; ""Reinsurers are aware of the potential capacity constraints and are continuing to build their teams to cope. While we may see bottlenecks in certain areas, we do not expect it to have a major impact on the market and schemes that go to market with clear objectives will continue to achieve good outcomes.""The potential for the longevity risk transfer market is clear, with exposure to longer lives a major risk for pension funds in the UK and elsewhere.""There are £2 trillion of UK defined benefit (NYSE:DB) liabilities and to date only £150 billion of these have hedged longevity risk. This is an area that continues to grow rapidly both in terms of the size and volume of annuity transactions and longevity swaps, with more innovative ways to access this market being developed,"" Beard continued.The market continues to discuss the need for longevity risk to be transferred in a liquid and tradable form, but longevity swaps and risk transfer transactions remain largely traditional, tapping the world's largest reinsurers and life insurers for most of their capacity needs.However, with activity expected to continue to be brisk there is an increasing chance that the capital markets will get their moment in longevity hedging. A number of ILS managers remain open to participation in longevity swaps and hedging, but opportunities continue to be scarce as traditional re/insurance firms soak up the bulk of any deal-flow.Beard suggests that market growth is likely to continue; ""With more and more pension schemes starting to think about a de-risking journey and how to manage their risks, the activity in this market is only expected to increase as longevity risk moves higher up the agenda for pension schemes.""The expectation that deal sizes will continue to shrink remains, a trend we've been covering for a few years now. The efficiencies gained in recent years are helping pension funds to transact in smaller deals more cost-effectively, opening the doors to much smaller pension plans to hedge their longevity risk.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

For the full list of managers we cover, please visit Schedule of Manager Reviews.I. IntroductionThis is part of a series of quarterly reviews that analyze the performance and portfolio characteristics of interesting equity managers running public (mutual funds) or private pooled investment vehicles (hedge funds) that are not accessible by mainstream investors. Our aim is to provide readers:All analysis is based on a clone portfolio of the manager's top 10 disclosed holdings, which allows readers to replicate the portfolio with ease if desired. It may not be an accurate reflection of the manager's actual investment performance. For more information on why we focus on the top 10, please refer to our Schedule of Manager Reviews.II. Manager BriefCantillon was founded in 2003 by William von Mueffling, who led Lazard Asset Management's hedge fund group. During his tenure from 1998 to 2003, von Mueffling posted annualized returns of 30%, helped by his technology shorts during the Dot Com bubble. The manager subscribes to a Buffett-esque investment philosophy, seeking businesses that produce high returns on shareholder equity.At its peak, Cantillon managed north of $10 billion in various hedge fund strategies. However, in 2009 the firm decided to shut-down many of its offerings to focus on managing long-only assets.According to a WSJ article:Cantillon charges clients a flat 1.25% fee, according to the article.III. Performance Analysis (USD Total Returns)After a strong 2013, Cantillon has underperformed the S&P 500 in 2014 and 2015, despite delivering positive absolute returns.

The portfolio is currently 10% cheaper than the S&P 500, with higher ROA and ROE. The manager's top 10 holdings are currently concentrated in the Technology sector, which comprises 50% of our equally-weighted portfolio.

Because at the end of the day, if you are an investor, you are buying the business. The FAST Graphs™ presented with this article will focus first on the business behind the stock. The orange line on the graph plots earnings per share since 2000. A quick glance vividly reveals the historical operating record of the company.Towers Watson (NASDAQ:TW) is a leading global professional services company that helps organizations improve performance through effective people, risk and financial management. The company offers solutions in the areas of benefits, talent management, rewards, and risk and capital management.This article will reveal the business prospects of Towers Watson & Co through the lens of FAST Graphs - fundamentals analyzer software tool. Therefore, it is offered as the first step before a more comprehensive research effort. Our objective is to provide companies that have excellent historical records and appear reasonably priced based on past, present and future data and expectations.A quick glance at the graph itself and the orange earnings justified valuation line will tell the readers volumes about how well the company has historically been managed and performed as an operating business. Simply put, the reader should ask whether this example is worthy of a greater investment of their time and effort based on the data as presented and organized. The FAST Graphs' unique advantage is the graphical articulation of the price value proposition.Earnings Determine Market Price: The following earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs™ clearly illustrates the importance of earnings. The Earnings Growth Rate Line or True Worth™ Line (orange line with white triangles) is correlated with the historical stock price line. On graph after graph the lines will move in tandem. If the stock price strays away from the earnings line (over or under), inevitably it will come back to earnings.Earnings & Price Correlated Fundamentals-at-a-GlanceA quick glance at the historical earnings and price correlated FAST Graphs™ on Towers Watson & Co shows a picture of undervaluation based upon the historical earnings growth rate of 14.2% and a current P/E of 12.6. Analysts are forecasting the earnings growth to continue at about 12%, and when you look at the forecasting graph below, the stock appears undervalued (it's inside of the value corridor of the five orange lines - based on future growth).Towers Watson & Co: Historical Earnings, Price, Dividends and Normal P/E Since 2000Performance Table Towers Watson & CoThe associated performance results with the earnings and price correlated graph, validates the principles regarding the two components of total return: capital appreciation and dividend income. Dividends are included in the total return calculation and are assumed paid, but not reinvested.When presented separately like this, the additional rate of return a dividend paying stock produces for shareholders becomes undeniably evident. In addition to the 10.4% capital appreciation (green circle), long-term shareholders of Towers Watson & Co, assuming an initial investment of $1,000, would have received an additional $181.95 in dividends (blue highlighting) that increased their total return from 10.4% to 10.9% per annum versus 1.7% in the S&P 500.The following graph plots the historical P/E ratio (the dark blue line) in conjunction with 10-year Treasury note interest. Notice that the current price earnings ratio on this quality company is as normal as it has been since 2000.A further indication of valuation can be seen by examining a company's current P/S ratio relative to its historical P/S ratio. The current P/S ratio for Towers Watson & Co is 1.20 which is historically normal.Looking to the FutureExtensive research has provided a preponderance of conclusive evidence that future long-term returns are a function of two critical determinants:1. The rate of change (growth rate) of the company's earnings2. The price or valuation you pay to buy those earningsForecasting future earnings growth, bought at sound valuations, is the key to safe, sound and profitable performance.The Estimated Earnings and Return Calculator Tool is a simple yet powerful resource that empowers the user to calculate and run various investing scenarios that generate precise rate of return potentialities. Thinking the investment through to its logical conclusion is an important component towards making sound and prudent commonsense investing decisions.The consensus of 9 leading analysts reporting to Capital IQ forecast Towers Watson & Co's long-term earnings growth at 12% (orange circle). Towers Watson & Co has low long-term debt at 19% of capital (red circle). Towers Watson & Co is currently trading at a P/E of 12.6, which is inside the value corridor (defined by the five orange lines) of a maximum P/E of 18. If the earnings materialize as forecast, based upon forecasted earnings growth of 12%, Towers Watson & Co's share price would $131.94 at the end of 2018 (brown circle on EYE Chart), which would represent a 16.8% annual rate of total return which includes dividends paid (yellow highlighting).Earnings Yield EstimatesDiscounted Future Cash Flows: All companies derive their value from the future cash flows (earnings) they are capable of generating for their stakeholders over time. Therefore, because Earnings Determine Market Price in the long run, we expect the future earnings of a company to justify the price we pay.Since all investments potentially compete with all other investments, it is useful to compare investing in any prospective company to that of a comparable investment in low risk Treasury bonds. Comparing an investment in Towers Watson & Co to an equal investment in 10-year Treasury bonds illustrates that Towers Watson & Co's expected earnings would be 8 (purple circle) times that of the 10-year T-bond interest (see EYE chart below). This is the essence of the importance of proper valuation as a critical investing component.Summary & ConclusionsThis report presented essential ""fundamentals at a glance"" illustrating the past and present valuation based on earnings achievements as reported.

2149673,52262,2014-04-20T14:26:11-04:00,"Willis Group has a strong core business but the trend towards falling margins last year was disappointing following 2012's restructuring at the firm.Higher interest rates and better P&C pricing would both help the company but neither is convincingly imminent.Despite the company's track record of growing revenues in recent years, there are enough question marks to warrant some caution on the stock.","Global insurance broker Willis Group Holdings (WSH) is an interesting investment opportunity right now. The $7.5B market cap company is facing a favorable pricing environment for its risk management services and the insurance brokerage operations will probably see better pricing in the months to come. Willis has also done a good job of generating consistent sales growth over the last five years. These factors compliment the firm's industry leading position. At the same time though, WSH is facing several company specific risks including the need to (further) restructure its operations and rebuild its franchise to take advantage of the acquisition of Hilb Rogal & Hobbs Co (completed in 2008 for $2.1B in cash and stock). In addition, WSH faces the added challenge of relatively high leverage and narrowing margins. The company completed a restructuring in 2012 to the tune of ~ $1.1B in charges including a ~$500M goodwill write-down.These restructuring charges led the firm to a one-time expense of $4.65 per share which more than wiped out profits for all of 2012 leading to a $2.58 adjusted loss for the year. Despite this action, operating margins at WSH still narrowed by 130 bps in the first three quarters of last year - a frankly surprising and disappointing outcome. The company's actions were probably driven by the new CEO Dominic Casserley in an effort to get all the bad news out to investors at once and pave the way for better times ahead. (This is a common tactic when a company changes CEO's.) Yet despite this restructuring and Casserley's plan for targeted head count reductions, the company did not perform all that much better last year than it did in 2012. As I mentioned operating margins shrunk - hardly an auspicious start. All things considered, I'm afraid the new CEO definitely has his work cut out for him.Given these firm specific issues, it's hard for me to get behind Willis Group at this stage, but it probably does bear watching in case things start to turn around later this year. WSH does sport a healthy 18.7% ROE with a consensus long-term growth forecast of more than 9% against a forward PE of only 15X. At the same time though, the last couple of earnings announcements have been disappointing, and of the 18 analysts covering the firm, 14 have a hold recommendation on the stock, so I'm hardly alone in my less than sanguine views.Willis Group is based in Ireland and offers specialized risk management consulting and investment brokerage services to clients especially in the aerospace, marine, construction, and energy industries. The company is in a very stable business and the large majority of its revenues are recurring annually, especially in the insurance and reinsurance division. WSH is the third largest broker for insurance and reinsurance in the world and the group contributes roughly 70% of revenues to the overall company. Willis' operations are admirably diversified extending from the mundane like Willis Re, an enormous reinsurance firm to operations providing services to the fine arts, jewelry, and horse racing businesses, and even specialty services involving unusual contingencies from kidnapping to ransom. These widely diversified operations certainly help to ensure that the firm is more stable and less susceptible to headwinds in any given industry. But, as investors in Citigroup (NYSE:C) are discovering, with greater diversification comes more difficultly in growing profits rapidly and righting the ship when it goes off course.While revenues for Willis rose about 5% in 2013 vs. 2012, and 2014 is likely to see similar growth rates, the trend towards shrinking operating margins are still a concern in my view. The profitability of Willis' insurance divisions are heavily influenced by two factors - property & casualty rates and interest rates. Right now P&C rates are pretty abysmal. I expect that this will change over the next 12 months and that rates will start to move higher. What's more, the reinsurance business is just terrible right now - absolutely horrible - there is too much capital sloshing around and too much competition even in obscure and relatively small segments of the market. However, this might be starting to change - recently Aspen Holdings (NYSE:AHL) got a buyout offer from Endurance (NYSE:ENH). If this marks the start of a trend and the reinsurance space sees some consolidation, then Willis will certainly benefit. As of right now though, it's too early to say with any certainty that either then P&C primary space or reinsurance space are bottoming and ready to move higher in a sustainable fashion. Eventually both markets will improve, and when they do, Willis will benefit - I'm just not convinced that improvement is starting yet.Moreover, while Willis will certainly make more money as interest rates rise over the next few years, it's not clear when such rate increases might start. Some market observers expect rates to begin moving higher as early as a year from now, but frankly I'm not sure that's justified given the generally subdued levels of inflation in both the US and UK, and the weak overall economic recovery. Both Mark Carney in the UK and Janet Yellen in the US appear to want to be absolutely sure their respective economies reach launch velocity before raising rates. This dovish tendency makes me think that rate increases when they do eventually arrive will be slow and steady rather than rapid and abrupt. Given that, bulls on Willis waiting for higher interest rates or insurance pricing improvements to move the stock higher need to be sure they are ready to hold the company over the long-term rather than looking for a quick pop earnings around higher rates. For investors with anything less than a very long-term outlook, I would suggest waiting a few months and then checking in on Willis Holdings again.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2096813,56062,2014-03-20T05:00:00-04:00,"Willis Group is well positioned to benefit from a whole series of tailwinds in the near future.The company enjoys a very stable business with over 90% of revenues recurring every year.The new CEO thinks like a value investor and has outlined a credible path to double digit growth.While the downside is well protected by Willis' stable revenue base, the compounded effect of several tailwinds together will likely produce tremendous upside over the next 2 years.","Willis Group Holdings (WSH) provides a range of insurance brokerage, reinsurance and risk management consulting services to its clients worldwide. It is recognized in providing specialized risk management advisory and other services on a global basis to clients in various industries including aerospace, marine, construction and energy. It has three segments: North America, International and Global.The company is the world's third largest insurance and largest reinsurance broker. About 70% of Willis' revenues are generated through commissions and over 93% is recurring. 78% of the market share in the company's industry is held by the top six players. Unlike their competitors Brown & Brown (NYSE:BRO) and Arthur J. Gallagher (NYSE:AJG), the brokers Willis, Aon (NYSE:AON) and Marsh & McLennan (NYSE:MMC) have large international businesses. But unlike Aon and Marsh & McLennan, Willis does not have a consulting business.Once a company has established its service network and the necessary scale, insurance brokerage is a very attractive business. It needs little incremental investment and is largely relationship-based.Given the stable, non-cyclical nature of its business, Willis could be a nice fit for retirement portfolios. The company has historically paid out between 30 and 50% of its earnings and has clearly stated its intention to steadily increase its dividend over time.Why Willis has lagged compared to its peersHere is an overview of Willis and its peers (data from Morningstar):While all its peers could achieve at least some EPS growth since 2009, Willis' EPS seems to be approximately stable, with the exceptions of 2011 and 2012.However, if we consider adjusted EPS, Willis starts to look a bit better:We see that, backing out several one-time charges, adjusted net income has been stable over the past five years. As far as adjusted EPS is concerned, dilution has taken its toll.But why did growth stall?Brown & Brown and Arthur J. Gallagher, having little international exposure, clearly benefited from the US recovery after the recession, whereas Aon and MMC benefited from their large consulting businesses.Here is a chart for AON, which exited low-margin insurance underwriting a few years ago and focused its portfolio towards higher-margin, capital light professional services. Human Resources, the consulting segment, now makes up 34% of total revenues, compared to 17% four years ago:This shows that a large part of AON's comparatively high earnings growth was due to its consulting business. The same also applies to MMC. So, all in all, AON's and MMC's brokerage segments did not do so much better than Willis.If we consider just organic growth, it would seem that Willis could even be doing better than them:The overall revenue growth trend has been OK:So why did this revenue growth not translate into earnings growth? The explanation lies in a rather unfortunate acquisition in 2008, which made North America approximately one-third of Willis' business and also came at the worst possible time, as property & casualty and interest rates fell off a cliff soon afterwards. Hence, while the added business increased the top line, the bottom line didn't grow and in 2013 the company was forced to record a large impairment charge to reduce the North American unit's goodwill.And the string of unfortunate circumstances still hasn't ended. Due to the extremely low interest rates not only did the company not make any money on its float, but also needed to pay large special contributions to its pension fund:While these contributions don't show up in the P&L statement, they effectively reduce available cash and book value. Basically Willis could barely cover dividends with its earnings and almost all excess cash went to pension contributions.Lollapalooza aheadWhen two or more tailwinds combine together, their effects get compounded on a tremendous scale. Charlie Munger calls this combination the Lollapalooza effect.Which tailwinds would that be in the case of Willis? Far more than two:1) Reduced or at least stable capital expenditures together with growing cash flows:During last year's investor day, the CEO stated the following (if not specified differently, all following quotes share the same source):2) Reduced or at least stable pension contributions:3) Higher returns on float:With higher interest rates, Willis can increase its investment income significantly. Before the crisis, investment income contributed each year about $70-100 million to its revenues; in 2013 investment income was only $15 million. As an intermediary, Willis holds funds generally in a fiduciary capacity for the account of third parties, typically as the result of premiums received from clients that are in transit to insurers and claims due to clients that are in transit from insurers.Currently these funds generate gross returns of $15 million, less than 1%. When interest rates will rise again, Willis should be able to generate returns on this float comparable to the period before the financial crisis. It would require only $26 million of additional investment income (or an increase of interest rates to a bit more than 2%) to increase Willis' free cash flow by 4%.4) Share repurchases:At current prices, Willis would need about $100 million of FCF to reduce shares outstanding by 1.5%.5) Structural tailwinds:6) Exposure to strongly growing emerging markets that over time will likely reach insurance penetration rates similar to those of the developed world:Which leads to a different, higher-margin revenue mix:7) Disciplined M&A activity, made possible by higher free cash flows:Presuming a net yield on investment of 13% (far below Willis' average return on equity of about 20% and without factoring in any leverage), the company would need to invest only $100 million to increase FCF by 2%.8) Clearly defined strategy to increase operating leverage:9) Increasing P&C insurance rates:Better pricing in the P&C insurance sector is almost inevitable because overall the insurance industry is losing money on an underwriting basis and investment returns have declined sharply due to low interest rates. Furthermore, insurance companies have been covered missing income with reserve releases for several years now, which means that reserves are currently developing unfavorably.SummaryTo sum up these many possible tailwinds, here are their respective, very conservatively projected impacts on annual FCF/share growth. I am projecting 2014 free cash flow of about $480 million, of which about $200 million would go to dividends, $100 million to share repurchases, $80 million to pension contributions and $100 million to M&A.An increase of interest rates of 1.5% would produce an increase of about 4% of net investment income.Share repurchases would add another 1.5%.Average revenue growth of 3% with increased operating leverage could add more than 3% to FCF.M&A activity, as explained above, could add another 2% to FCF.Higher overall margins, due to better revenue mix, of only 25 basis points would produce 2% FCF growth.Finally, even if P&C rates increase only slightly, this could easily add another 2% to the bottom line.All in all, that's 10.5% growth per year, plus an increase of 4% in years with rising interest rates. In addition, the dividend should continue to provide a yield of about 3%.This growth certainly will not materialize year after year on a steady curve, but is highly likely to be delivered as an average compounded growth rate for the next several years.ValuationBased on their respective P/E ratios, all peers currently trade at a 20-40% premium to Willis. Even based on 2015 forward P/E ratios, Willis is by far the cheapest, trading only at 13.6 times its consensus 2015 EPS forecast. However, together with AON, Willis is the company among the group with the strongest forecast EPS growth. Yet AON trades at 16.3 times its forecast 2015 EPS.If only some of the tailwinds described above materialize, Willis will likely deliver on its promises and achieve FCF/share of at least $3 per share in 2015. This would require only a compounded FCF/share growth rate of 10%.At that point, investors will realize that the same reasons that have made the company a laggard until now will have sustained its outperformance thereafter. But as usual, investors prefer to look into the rear mirror and not through the windscreen. Leaving aside its unfortunate acquisition in the US, the most important headwind for Willis has been the low interest environment that reduced net investment income by 80% and its net income by 20-25%, consuming all its free cash and leaving little room for growth through M&A and share repurchases. But interest rates won't stay low forever.As soon as investors will see earnings growth materialize, they will understand that most of what they had considered ""uncertainties"" around Willis' business model had actually been macroeconomic headwinds and the stock will see a reduction of the valuation gap to its competitors. This means that, only 1.5-2 years from now, Willis could trade at a multiple comparable to those of its peers, which would translate into about $60 or a total return (including dividends) of about 50% on its current share price. On the other hand, even if low interest rates or low P&C insurance rates persist, thanks to share repurchases, higher operating leverage, a shift to higher margin business and revenue growth in line with historical averages, Willis should still be able to deliver nicely growing earnings and maintain its dividend. In this case, stronger growth would only be delayed and probably kick in soon afterwards. Thus, I see very little downside here and a clearly asymmetric risk/reward profile.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in WSH over the next 72 hours.

This Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) has been acquiring companies to expand its exchange business, which was already expected to grow by the double digits in fiscal 2014.Towers Watson is a professional services consulting company that specializes in the management of employee benefits, talent management, rewards and benefit exchanges, aka the healthcare exchanges. It has 14,000 associates worldwide.The Liazon AcquisitionOn Nov 22, Towers Watson announced it had acquired Liazon Corporation, a privately-held developer of private benefit exchanges for active employees, for $215 million. Liazon, which was founded in 2007, focused on companies with 100 to 10,000 employees, or the small to mid-sized company.This fills a hole in Towers Watson exchanges business which had focused on larger companies with more than 100,000 employees. Towers Watson expects smaller companies to move to the exchange model faster than the larger companies. It also gives Towers Watson a big entry into the active employee exchange business instead of the retirees business.Liazon had 100,000 on its active exchanges. Towers Watson expects to have 40,000 in fiscal 2014. Its combined 140,000 customers already puts it as one of the larger national players in the active exchange business.The exchange business is changing faster than even those in the business had anticipated. Towers Watson called it a ""transformational time"" in the benefits industry.The acquisition is expected to be dilutive to fiscal 2014 by $0.10 to $0.15. However, the company expects it to be accretive by fiscal 2015, especially in the second half of the year when open enrollments occur.Full Year Estimates RiseDespite expectations that the Liazon acquisition will be dilutive to earnings, the fiscal 2014 Zacks Consensus Estimate has still been rising.It jumped to $5.68 from $5.64 over the last month with one analyst lowering and one raising their estimate in that time period. That is earnings growth of 3.6%.The analysts are more bullish on fiscal 2015, for obvious reasons, as the acquisition will be accretive that year. The fiscal 2015 Zacks Consensus Estimate jumped to $6.22 from $6.06 in the last four weeks with two estimates being raised in that time. That is earnings growth of 9.6%.Shares at New Multi-Year HighsInvestors are excited about the growth in the exchange business. In the 2014 fiscal first quarter, the Exchange Solutions group grew sales by 154%.But this is the smallest of the company's segments, at just 4% of total revenue. Its benefits group, which generates more than half of its revenue, saw flat sales in the first quarter.Still, shares have soared to five-year highs.Towers Watson has a forward P/E of 21.2, just slightly higher than the consulting industry which averages 20.9x.There are ways to play the changes in healthcare that go beyond simply buying the insurers.

3208676,88626,2015-05-25T05:41:56-04:00,WSH is an excellent growth story available at a reasonable price with approximately 25% upside in the next one year.The company's expanded global footprint as a result of its recent and upcoming buyouts will sharpen its competitive edge.The company's “value creation strategy” is expected to significantly boost its profitability.,"I am modestly bullish on the insurance broking and risk solutions industry in general. Willis Group Holdings (WSH) is a relatively small but attractive growth story in this industry. The company's international expansion coupled with its ongoing acquisition spree is likely to drive its bottom line growth for the next two/three years. I believe the stock has a favorable risk-reward ratio for medium-term investors with a one-year time horizon. The stock is expected to have significant upside of approximately 25% and very limited downside.Industry OutlookOutlook for the insurance broking industry is bullish for the next three to five years. If the unemployment rate continues to decline, albeit rather slowly, the home ownership rate and auto sales should continue to rise, leading to rising demand for various property/casualty insurance products. Amid this scenario, I expect that WSH's ""value creation strategy,"" as pointed out by CEO Dominic Casserley, will help the company gain significant market share. In addition to WSH, the companies that are also expected to benefit from this trend include Marsh & McLennan Companies (NYSE:MMC), Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (NYSE:AJG) and Aon Plc (NYSE:AON). However, WSH is best positioned among the peer group to benefit from the trend.Willis Group vis-à-vis CompetitorsDuring the last two and a half years, WSH's EBITDA growth remained subdued primarily due to soft investment income and rising opex. However, with the company looking into various options to boost operational efficiency including cutting opex, I believe EBITDA should start rising from this year. Further, global expansion and recent/upcoming buyouts should drive EBITDA as well.Among the peer group, despite MMC and AON enjoying significantly lower leverage, their growth prospects are limited given their large market capitalization. In contrast, WSH and AJG are mid-cap companies and I believe WSH has the potential to become a large-cap company with a market cap of more than $10 billion in the next twelve months.I expect that WSH's top-line and EBITDA margin will grow consistently going forward as a result of its ""value creation strategy,"" as mentioned above. Its recent three buyouts during 2014, which are Charles Monat, Max Matthiessen and the IFG Group, should significantly boost top-line performance in the coming quarters. The three acquisitions have set the stage for WSH's global market share expansion in the insurance, pension and benefits businesses. In addition, the acquisition of Miller Insurance Services, which is expected to close in the middle of the current year, will also contribute to the company's future sales growth.AJG is also aiming to grow its market share by acquisitions. The company very recently announced the acquisition of James R. Weir Insurance Agency. But compared to WSH, AJG's leveraged balance sheet makes it a less attractive growth story. Furthermore, AJG's EBITDA margin is significantly lower than that of WSH and the peer group average, which is also worrisome.Compared to MMC and AON, the financial leverage of WSH is definitely higher. But if the leverage is considered as a means of growth, it doesn't appear significant. On the contrary, WSH's 20% EBITDA margin, which is almost on par with MMC and AON, is certainly encouraging. I believe WSH's cost cutting measures will help boost EBITDA margin further, resulting in improved profitability.ValuationIt's true that WSH isn't attractively valued in terms of TTM EV/EBITDA and EV/Revenues compared to its competitors. But I believe if one wants to own a high growth company, one has to pay the price.In the next twelve months, however, WSH's revenues and EBITDA should rise at an improved pace than the past twelve months. Organic sales growth is expected to be around mid single digits, which management is focusing on, and EBITDA should grow at low double digits. I believe this is certainly attainable given management's willingness to deliver growth, the evidence, which was clearly visible in the past two quarters.If EBITDA grows at 10% in the next twelve months, it should be around $836 million on revenues of approximately $3.98 billion (at an EBITDA margin of 21%). I'd be comfortable with one-year forward EV/EBITDA of 15x (which is still lower than AJG's current multiple), which leads to a market cap of $10.87 billion after adjusting for $1.67 billion of net debt. This equals $60.60 per share with 179.32 million shares outstanding. At this price, WSH will be available at 2.73x one-year forward EV/Revenues, which I believe is reasonable.ConclusionWSH is gradually becoming a top international company in the risk solutions business. In today's uncertain and highly competitive business environment, risk management assumes a bigger role for smaller to medium sized companies across the world. WSH's expanded global footprint will help the company further sharpen its competitive edge in the coming years."
3297305,25120,2015-07-02T12:50:45-04:00,"Willis Group and Towers Watson are merging in what could become a giant global professional service firm.Investors should benefit from an increase in scale, cost synergies and tax synergies in this all-equity deal.Shareholders in Towers Watson have not been enthusiastic given the disappointing deal terms.The lack of enthusiasm surrounding the deal and the discount at which Towers Watson is being valued makes me a buyer of those shares.If the deal breaks down shares of Towers Watson are likely to bounce back upwards while investors benefit from synergies in case the deal proceeds.","Willis Group (WSH) announced that it will merge with Towers Watson (NASDAQ:TW) in order to create a giant in advisory, broking and other professional services.The deal makes sense from a strategic point of view. By combining the operations the companies are able to offer more services in more geographical areas at lower costs. Given the fact that Willis is domiciled in Ireland, the merger company will benefit from additional tax savings as well.Given the disappointing price reaction in the share price of Towers Watson in response to the news, I'm a buyer of shares. If a deal fails, shares could see a bounce higher while investors stand to benefit from extensive cost and tax synergies if a deal proceeds.The Deal HighlightsWillis Group and Towers Watson will combine their operations in an all-equity deal. As part of the merger terms, existing shareholders in Willis Group will hold 50.1% of the shares of the new combination which will be named ""Willis Towers Watson.""Both companies offer advice, benefits solutions, brokerage and advisory solutions as well as risk management solutions, among others. Given the complementary offerings in terms of services and overlap in geographical and product offerings, the tie-up should boost the market positioning of the group while deliver on synergies.Even as the deal has been announced as a merger of equals, it seems that investors in Willis have gotten a better deal. Not only will its executives hold a prominent position in the new entity, the name of the new company will start with Willis as well. More importantly for shareholders, the stock of Willis has outperformed Towers Watson in response to the deal.Investors in Towers Group will receive a one-time dividend of $4.87 per share as well as 2.649 shares in Willis. Based on the closing prices the day before the deal has been announced this offer values Towers Watson at $125.13. This is kind of remarkable given that shares of Towers Watson closed Monday's trading session at $137.98 per share, implying a near 10% discount.If both companies manage to close the deal under these terms, a reverse stock split will take place in the same 2.649 ratio so each shareholder in Towers Watson will hold the same number of shares in the new combination.Financial Performance Of The Individual Businesses And The Pro-Forma ImplicationsThe Willis Group is quite an international business with a great position in Great Britain. The business has strong positions in global risk advisory, (re)insurance, broking and benefits. The deal presentation reports that the business posts pro-forma sales of $3.8 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $829 million.Towers Watson is very strong in benefits although it offers rewards, exchange solutions and risk services as well. These solutions brought in $3.5 billion in sales and adjusted EBITDA of $670 million on a trailing basis.The combination announced that it believes it will be able to deliver on $100 to $125 million in cost synergies which should be realized within three years after closure. This is equivalent to 1-1.5% of total sales which seems achievable. Another important benefit of the deal is the fact that Willis is domiciled in Ireland for tax purposes. The group anticipates to report an effective tax rate in the mid-twenties going forward.The Balance SheetTowers Watson has roughly 70 million shares outstanding ahead of the deal. The company held $760 million in cash at the latest quarterly report while operating with $206 million in debt.Willis has 182 million shares outstanding as of the latest quarterly earnings report. The company held $503 million in cash while it operates with $2.3 billion in debt.After taking into account the $4.87 per share dividend which investors in Towers stand to receive, the combined cash holdings of the merged company will be roughly $920 million. The new combination will operate with $2.5 billion in debt for a net debt load of $1.6 billion. This is roughly 1 times the adjusted EBITDA foreseen for the combination which is a very manageable leverage ratio.Investors in Towers Watson will receive 2.649 shares in Willis for each share they hold. This implies that the float in Willis will increase from 182 million to roughly 367 million shares. Those shares have risen to $47 in response to the deal which thereby values the combination at $17.2 billion. Including the modest net debt position the enterprise valuation comes in at close to $19 billion, equivalent to roughly 11 times EBITDA.The combination posted earnings of $740 million over the past 12 months. Towers reported $378 million in earnings and this profit contribution could increase by roughly $50 million as the effective tax rate on these profits could fall by roughly ten percentage points. The $125 million in cost synergies could boost the bottom line by nearly $100 million at the lower tax rate. These two items combined could push pro-forma earnings to roughly $900 million in the future.Based on the current equity valuation of roughly $17 billion, equity in the combination now trades at roughly 19 times earnings.Towers Watson Investors Are Not HappyInvestors in Towers Watson do not like the deal given that the offer for the shares represented a near 10% discount from the closing price of the shares ahead of the deal. Shares traded at $138 ahead of the deal which valued that business at $9.7 billion, or at $9.2 billion after subtracting the net cash holdings of the business.Shares fell roughly $12 in response to the deal, implying a wealth destruction of roughly $840 million as a result of the deal terms. The exact opposite occurred at Willis Group as shares of that company rose by $1.5 after investors liked the prospects for the shares given the favorable exchange ratio and the potential synergies. These modest gains in the share price of Willis Group added roughly $270 million in value, or roughly double that amount if you add in the newly issued shares.The situation that investors in Towers Watson will convert their holdings at a discount compared to pre-deal price levels is highly unusual given that the company is essentially the ""selling"" party in this deal. Management can argue that investors benefit from cost synergies as well as tax synergies which are the result of the tax domicile of Willis Group. While this is true, I do think that Towers Group has some real work ahead in order to convince its shareholders to tender their shares on these terms.While the discount in the valuation for the shares of Towers is remarkable, it is also noteworthy that the combined valuation of both companies has fallen in response to the deal. This value destruction is the result despite the anticipated cost savings of $125 million and potential tax savings of roughly $50 million. Based on these items, one would expect value accretion in the combination of both firms to the tune of $1.5-$2.5 billion after applying normal EBITDA multiples to these benefits.Final ThoughtsGiven the lackluster reception of the deal I do see potential room for some short to medium term gains. The cost synergies and tax savings are highly achievable and the lack of enthusiasm from the investment community pretty much shows that these gains have not been priced in at the moment.While a deal could fall apart, it would not be a disaster for either of the companies as no fat premiums are offered. For that reason I do see upside as the synergy estimates are credible, while the company stresses that these estimates might prove to be conservative.While investors in Towers Group could decide to not tender their shares given the discount, a rejection of the offer does not have to be a problem. If a deal falls apart, it is likely that shares of Towers Group rise to the $140s again, creating a nice short-term gain. Other alternatives include an improvement of the deal terms for shareholders in Towers. Even if a deal goes through at current terms there's long-term upside based on the relative sizable cost and tax synergies.Given this situation I'm a buyer Towers Willis amidst a favorable risk-reward scenario."

So it has rolled the dice with a $435 million cash offer to buy Extend Health, which is in the business of running those kinds of exchanges.Extend's current business is Medicare exchanges, but the structure of the new exchanges, due to be operational by the end of 2013, would be very similar. Its CEO is Bryce Williams, who got into the business through eHealth.This is a major dice roll for Towers Watson. Its balance sheet shows $427 million in cash and it's covering a $435 million transaction. Analysts say Towers Watson may have paid too much, and the company admits that in the short run there will be a $0.02-per-share hit to earnings this year, but that it will be accretive afterward.In its run-up to the transaction the company also took on a new Chief Information Officer, named John Dick, most of whose experience is in the banking business. That's actually pretty relevant here, in terms of security, finance, privacy, and the need to deal with high volumes of sensitive data. (The operational expertise will come from Extend Health, with Dick acting as the main company's eyes on progress.)After an initial gap-down in the share price of 10%, Towers Watson stock recovered in Monday's trading and currently sits just $1/share lower than it did before the deal. But investors need to look at this as an entirely new company. Towers Watson's work in human resources will help it bring lots of potential clients to the exchange, and assuming businesses and consumers are both required to seek insurance over the next few years growth could be enormous, since it would have a massive head start.It's speculative, true. Towers Watson is no longer a risk-off stock doing consulting, but a risk-on stock managing a market. But it's an interesting speculation, and if the Supreme Court rules for the government the stock could run up.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

TW does not sell organic burritos or the latest smartphone. The company is not involved in social networking. But TW is the type of company that should attract the attention of the true value investor.TW was formed in 2010 by the merger of Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt Worldwide. Both of the prior companies had long histories of successful business in the areas of consulting and management of business processes such as employee benefits, risk management and talent and rewards. I had been a happy shareholder of Watson Wyatt Worldwide for a number of years prior to the merger. That company had roughly doubled revenue and profits over the 2005-9 period and shareholders had been rewarded with a rough doubling in the stock prior to the 2008-9 market drop.Since the merger, investors have continued reason to be pleased by progress in the business. The company has reported double-digit increases in annual revenue and adjusted EPS. In its most recent earnings announcement out last week, revenue increased by 11% and adjusted EPS by 22% vs. prior year. Both numbers soundly beat analyst forecasts. The company also issued a strong outlook for 2012 seeing EPS in the range of $5.05-$5.15. That would correspond to a 95% increase in EPS vs. 2011 and a 150% increase vs. 2010 levels. Large mergers often do not live up to promises, but so far this one appears to be working well.TW reported in it earnings conference call last week that clients are very pleased with the increased depth and breadth of services as a result of the merger. TW describes itself as the largest actuarial company in the U.S., Germany, the Netherlands and Brazil. It also claims to the leader in U.S. healthcare and group benefits consulting. TW is clearly profiting from the current environment that finds many companies seeking to make health benefits more efficient and where Dodd Frank is driving changes in executive compensation. The company also sees increasing M&A activity in areas like P&C insurance as a coming growth opportunity. One possible risk factor is the move from defined retirement benefit plans to defined contribution plans.TW divides it business into three segments: Benefits (roughly 64% of revs., Risk and Financial Services (21% of revs.) and Talent and Rewards (15% of revs.) In recent quarters revenue from the Benefits sector have been growing at a 5-10% rate, while the other sectors have seen 10%+ growth on average. TW has a diversified client base that includes 84% of the Fortune 100, 76% of FTSE listed companies, and three quarters of the world's top insurance companies according to a recent corporate presentation. The largest client contributes less than 1% of total revenue.On a geographic split in 2010 , 52% of revenue came from U.S. clients, 22% from UK, 6 from Canada, another 7% from Germany and the Netherlands combined with the remainder from regions like Asia Pacific and the Middle East.TW has continued to make smaller acquisitions since the merger, acquiring the insurance software and consulting company EMB in Nov 2010, the health and welfare benefits company Aliquant in Dec. 2010 and raising its stake to 51% in the South African actuarial company Fifth Quadrant in 2011. Most recently (Oct. 2011) it purchased WellsCanning a company specializing in investment advice to the insurance industry.On a valuation basis TW stock is currently selling at about 12.4x projected 2012 EPS and about 1.3x projected 2012 revenue. This is a very modest valuation considering the growth record of TW and its predecessor company.The balance sheet is very strong with no long-term debt and $560 MM in cash and short-term investments.The company pays a modest dividend of $0.40/share corresponding to a 0.6% yield. But the dividend was upped by 33% in 2010 and future increases are likely if business growth continues.TW is not a widely covered company. Yahoo Finance lists only 10 analysts, a small number for a company with a market capitalization of $4.5B. Standard & Poor's does not even cover the stock. I think over time this will change as the business accomplishments of TW become more widely recognized.Towers Watson is a core holding in accounts managed for Freedom Mountain Investment clients and in my individual accounts. I have added shares since the most recent quarterly earnings announcement.Disclosure: I am long TW."

I tried just about everything over the years, and I learned quickly it is better to use a sim account first. Now I use a few methods that produce consistant results.In this article we will go over an upcoming dividend that I may capture at a minimum amount of risk. The criteria that I use is that I must be able to sell a call option in either the front, or first back month that is in the money, and with enough premium that I will not mind getting exercised early (which happens often and can be a good thing if the trades are executed correctly).This is one of my favorite and easy to understand methods of making gains through options and dividends. Although much of the gains will come from dividends, it should be noted in my experience, the option decay can provide a return. This is especially true in lower yielding stocks.Willis Group Holdings PLC (WSH)  Yield: 2.74%Dividend Amount: $0.26Ex-Dividend Date: September 28, 2011Beta: 1.02In combination with my buying the stock and after checking company updates, offer to sell the October $35.00 strike call for $1.27 over the intrinsic value. The option may get exercised early for a gain. If not, after qualifying for the dividend, I will attempt to close out the trade with a gain of near $0.14.The P/E ratio has been discounted, as the current trailing twelve months (ttm) P/E ratio is 23, while the forward P/E ratio is now 12.6. It will be interesting to see if pricing is currently at a discount, or if the market has been correct to price in lower growth expectations. The current book value per share is 15.66.For the same fiscal period year-over-year, revenue has improved to $3.34 billion for 2010 vs. $3.26 billion for 2009. The bottom line has rising earnings year-over-year of $455.00 million for 2010 vs. $438.00 million for 2009. The company's earnings before income and taxes are rising with an EBIT year-over-year of $753.00 million for 2010 vs. $694.00 million for 2009.At $36.27, the price is currently below the 200 day moving average of 38.33, and below the 60 day moving average of 38.99. Looking at the price movement over the last month, the stock has moved higher in price 9.35%, with a one year change of 24.42%. Comparing to the S&P 500 price changes, the price performances are 2.24% vs. the S&P 500 from a month ago, and year to date difference is 14.86% vs. the S&P 500 price change.Remember, you must buy a stock at least three business days before the record date (at least one business day before the ex-dividend date) to qualify for a dividend.My last step (completed before making a trade on the same day) is to check company announcements, and news sources for possible events that may cause the stock price to move. This is especially important during earnings season.I research the different call options and calculate the expected probabilities based on Beta, Bid, Offer, Volume traded the current day, open interest, and time value / implied volatility. The options offer some level of protection from down moves in the stock, and provide revenue to cover the times that the options do not fully cover down moves in the stock. Income is not needed from the option premiums, so a break even from premiums received/stock losses ratio is a win.I use a proprietary blend of technical analysis, financial crowd behavior, and fundamentals in my short-term trades, and while not totally the same in longer swing trades to investments, the concepts used are similar. Nothing in the article should be considered investment advise, but you may want to use this article as a starting point of your own research with your financial planner. I use Seeking Alpha, Edgar Online, and Yahoo Finance for most of my data.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in WSH over the next 72 hours."
145931,21084,2009-06-29T06:34:48-04:00,,"With the news of Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt (NASDAQ:WW) merging to form Towers Watson, tongues are wagging about what this means for the employee benefits consulting business in general. According to the June 28, 2009 press release, the all stock deal ""will create one of the world's leading professional services firms.""
The combination comes at an interesting time. Besides the economic rollercoaster we've been riding, there is a real debate about the role of consultants, particularly whether they will wear the hat of pension fiduciary, functional or otherwise. Additionally, many of the decisions that challenge pension executives are increasingly specialized, making it difficult for generalists to assist. Then there is the issue of fees and whether ""traditional"" firms can prosper as competition mounts. The offering of asset management services by select consultative organizations illustrates their respective desire to juice up revenue, despite the possible conflicts of interest that ensue.
Whether the Watson Wyatt - Towers Perrin deal is a harbinger of things to come remains to be seen. One thing is sure. The advice and consulting business is changing rapidly.Disclosure: No positions"
202130,20568,2010-04-30T17:21:41-04:00,,"Willis Group Holdings plc (WSH) reported fourth-quarter earnings of $1.27 per share, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.17. The company had earned $1.16 per share in the year-ago quarter. The beat was driven primarily by growth in organic business and expense saving initiatives.Net income from continuing operations came in at $204 million or $1.20 per share, compared with $192 million or $1.15 per share in the prior-year period. Quarterly results in 2010 were negatively impacted by a charge of $12 million or 7 cents per share, related to the devaluation of the Venezuelan currency. The prior-year quarter results had a $2 million or 1 cent impact for integration costs following the acquisition of Hilb Rogal & Hobbs Company.For the reported quarter, revenues were up 5% year over year to $972 million. Organic growth in commissions and fees was 3% and reflected a 5% net new business growth, partially offset by a negative 2% impact from declining premium rates and other market factors.The North America segment contributed 1% organic growth in commissions and fees. The company reported strong new business, steady client retention and benefited from the cost saving initiatives. However, the soft insurance markets and the continuing weakness in the US economy were major headwinds. Operating margin of 25.5% was up 60 basis points (bps) year over year.The International business segment contributed 3% organic growth in commissions and fees. While the company experienced solid growth in Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe, it was partially offset by a soft rate environment and weakness in the UK and Ireland retail market and sluggish growth in some developed European economies. Operating margin was 33.9%, compared with 34.9% in the year ago quarter.The Global segment's organic growth in commissions and fees was 7% year over year, primarily driven by the Reinsurance division with solid organic growth in North America. Global Specialties also reported positive organic growth, driven by financial and executive risks and marine lines. However, operating margin was seasonally high at 45.5% and in line with the prior-year quarter.Adjusted operating margin was 32.2%, up 240 bps from the year-ago quarter. The improvement reflected organic growth in commissions and fees, coupled with the benefits of cost saving initiatives.Investment income was $9 million in the quarter, down from $13 million in the year-ago quarter, primarily due to lower interest rates. Expenses were $671 million, compared with $656 million in the prior-year quarter.As of March 31, 2010, cash and cash equivalents totaled $196 million, up from $191 million as of Dec. 31, 2010.We are encouraged to see Willis' improved organic growth in revenues from its three segments, with strong client retention. The ""Shaping Our Future"" initiatives are also contributing to growth.However, the company expects that the soft insurance market is likely to continue despite an increase in the number of natural catastrophes in early 2010. Additionally, the weakness in the US economy will remain a headwind and restrict any significant top line growth in the company."

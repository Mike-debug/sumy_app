Part 1 examined MGE Energy (MGEE), Part 2 reviewed Alliant Energy (LNT) and Part 3 compared Duke Energy (DUK) and NextEra (NEE). The remaining three stocks are Atmos Energy (ATO), WEC Energy (WEC), and Xcel Energy (XEL), are covered in Part 4. Of the three, Atmos offers the best current value while WEC and Xcel shares appear to be overpriced.SourceThe original premise of this series, The Best of the Best, was to identify utility companies with three important similarities: 1) CFRA rating of A for 10-year consistency in earnings and dividend growth; 2) S&P credit rating of A; 3) Operating in states rated as Above Average by Regulatory Research Associates [RRA] arm of S&P Global. The strategy is to locate companies operating in favorable regulatory environments whose management has utilized the support to both manage a conservative balance sheet and to generate above average earnings and dividend growth. Of 50+ utilities evaluated, only the seven companies listed above made the cut. However, these three utilities have smaller percentages of their business in states with the highest rating by RRA.Atmos EnergyAtmos Energy is the largest publicly traded local distribution natural gas utility [LDC]. ATO services over 3.3 million utility customers in the Southwest, eastern mountain states, and lower Midwest: Texas, Colorado, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Virginia. ATO is a fully regulated utility offering exposure to both state-regulated LDC and a 5,700-mile intra-state gas transmission pipeline combined with a storage network. ATO is a mid-cap value style selection with a 2.5% yield.The LDC segment generated 83% of fiscal Sept 2019 operating revenues and 63% of operating profit. The table below outlines ATO’s customer count by state, the percentage of total customers, the RRA regulatory support environment for each state (Above Average 1-1 (highest) to 1-3, Average 2-1 to 2-3, Below Average 3-1 to 3-3 (lowest)), and the state PUC allowed return on equity [ROE].As shown, the majority of ATO’s customers lie in Texas, which is rated Below Average 3-1 for regulatory support of its utilities. Texas accounted for 53% of 2019 LDC operating income. Approx. 12% of customer service territory are in the states of Virginia and Mississippi and are rated Above Average for regulatory support. These two states generated about 16% of operating income. The balance, or 26% of customers, live in states considered as Average for regulatory support and contributed 31% of 2019 operating income. As shown, while 63% of customers live in Texas, the Below Average rating by RRA for regulatory financial support shows up in lower operating profits per customer for that segment of ATO’s business.In addition to the LDC business, Atmos operates 5,700 miles of intra-state natural gas pipeline and five natural gas storage facilities. In FY2019, the pipeline and storage business generated 17% of revenues and 37% of operating profit. Compared to the state-allowed ROE regulation of between 9.10% and 9.80%, the intra-state pipeline and storage ROE is 11.5%.Atmos LDC operating income for FY2020 9-months through June 30 increased from $447 million in 2019 to $496 in 2020, led by $71 million in rate increases, $10 million in customer growth, and $10 million decrease in operating expenses, offset by $10 million in COVID-related decline in customer volumes and $25 million increase in property taxes combined with increase in depreciation and amortization. Overall, ATO LDCs have been granted $145 million in rate increases so far in FY2020 with an additional $140 million pending and in progress, compared to a total of $115 million in rate increases in FY2019.The pipeline and storage segment generated $227 million in operating profits for the same FY2020 period vs $209 last year, driven by $40 million increase in rates offset by increases in operating expenses.In FY2019, Atmos earned $4.35 per share, and during its 3rd qtr investors presentation, management has offered a guidance of $4.65 (midpoint) this fiscal year. In FY 2021, ATO could earn close to $5.00 per share. It is important for investors to appreciate that ~70% of earnings per share for Atmos is generated during the 6 months of October to March.As with many utilities, Atmos growth in the future will be driven by its capital expenditures additions to its rate base. However, according to its latest investor’s presentation, 88% of its $1.4 billion capital budget for FY2020 is earmarked for “safety and reliability” projects. $916 million is slated for replacement of old and potentially “leak-prone” distribution and service pipes, an Achilles heel for LDCs across the country. While many pipe replacement programs carry preferential inclusion into the rate base, this is a “replacement of assets” issue rather than an underlying business growth issue.WEC Energy Group is a multi-utility providing electric and natural gas service to customers in Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. In addition, WEC is 60% owner of American Transmission Co [ATC], a JV with other Wisconsin utilities in operating and developing FERC-regulated high voltage electric transmission networks. WEC is also aggressively expanding its non-regulated renewable energy generation capacity through its construction and purchase of wind and solar farms throughout the Midwest.WEC serves 1.6 million electric customers in Wisconsin and Michigan, as well operating a natural gas LDC for 2.9 million customers in Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Michigan. As with most regulated utilities, a hefty capital expenditure budget expanding the regulated rate base will be a driving factor in WEC future earnings growth. Management is working on a projected 2020 to 2024 electric and gas utility cap ex program of $8.5 billion, with many of its projects covered by timely inclusion into the rate base via riders. For example, most “leak-prone” LDC pipe replacement cap ex is included in the rate base not long after project completion. Management expects to invest an additional $1.3 billion in ATC assets. Non-regulated renewable power generation is earmarked to grow by $5.2 billion. Combined, WEC has an aggressive $15 billion 5-yr capital expenditure program.WEC is expected to earn $3.72 per share this year and $4.00 in 2021, up from $3.58 in 2019. From a state regulatory environment vantage point, 55% of earnings is generated from regulated utilities in Wisconsin, with an Above Average 1-2 rating by RRA. 14% of earnings come from Illinois (Below Average 3-1) and 4% from Michigan (Average 2-1) and Minnesota (Average 2-2). FERC-regulated ATC generates 6% of earnings, with non-regulated power generation making up the balance 23%.Operating cash flow is expected to grow from $1.0 billion last year to over $1.5 billion in 2022. With the majority of cap ex funding coming from operating cash flow and increased debt, analysts are not anticipating addition dilutive share issuance over the next 3 years. However, total liabilities are expected to grow from $24.6 billion last year to $28.7 billion by the end of 2022, representing a 17% increase in indebtedness.WEC is expected to grow earnings per share by 6% to 7% a year, about average with the utility sector. The dividend payout should follow suit, mirroring the underlying earnings growth. However, with a current 2.7% yield, the cash income rewards seem a bit light compared to WEC multi-utility peers.More information can be found from their Sept 2020 investor presentation.Xcel Energy serves almost 6 million customer, 3.8 million electric and 2.1 million natural gas. Operating as Northern States Power in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, along with Public Service Company of Colorado and Southwestern Public Service Company, which serves customers in Texas and New Mexico. XEL also operates one of the largest renewable power networks in the US, with 23% of its generating capacity from solar and wind resources. The electric utility operations accounted for 83% of operating revenues in 2019, the LDC natural gas utility operations generated 16% of operating revenues, and non-regulated and other for 1%.From a regulatory vantage point, allowed ROE for Xcel’s 14 rate jurisdictions range from 9.2% to 10.75% with a 9.6% system-wide weighted average allowed ROE. XEL’s largest service territories are Minnesota and Colorado which combined represent 77% of ongoing earnings per share. Colorado (RRA rating Average 2-1) oversees $12.4 billion in WEC regulated rate base assets and contributed $1.11 of ongoing earnings. Minnesota (RRA rating Average 2-2) is right behind CO overseeing $11.3 billion in rate base assets and $1.04 in earnings per share. Texas (RRA rating Below Average 3-1) and New Mexico (RRA rating Below Average 3-1) oversee a combined $4.7 billion rate base and contributed $0.51 per share in earnings. Lastly, Wisconsin (RRA rating Above Average 1-2) and Michigan (RRA rating Average 2-1) oversee $1.7 billion in rate base assets and generated $0.15 in earnings per share.Xcel is set to invest more than $22 billion in capital expenditures in 2020-24, much of it going to renewable energy projects and the electric grid infrastructure needed to support renewable energy. The expansion of its rate base will drive earnings higher by 6% a year and will also reflect on dividend growth of a similar amount. However, like WEC, XEL’s current distribution yield is also a bit light at 2.5%.More information can be found in XEL latest investor presentation.All three companies have exposure to aging and “leak-prone” cast iron and/or uncoated steel LDC main (under the road) and service (road to meter) pipes. The Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration estimates there are 68,000 miles of distribution pipes and over 1.8 million miles of service connections in need of replacement. An important annual publication for natural gas utility investors to review is the Natural Gas Distribution Infrastructure Replacement and Modernization: A Review of State Programs which outlines the status of pipe replacement by state. While there is no reliable estimate on the total cost liability to replace these problematic pipes, in urban settings, the cost could exceed $10 million per mile.Of the three companies Atmos Energy, WEC Energy and Xcel Energy, ATO offers the best “value” from a price to earnings vantage point. ATO has a TTM PE ratio of 19x vs 26x for WEC and XEL and all three have approx. the same EPS growth potential of 5% to 7%. All three offer the same dividend yield of 2.4% to 2.6% with the identical dividend growth profile.Atmos also gets a minor leg up on the other two utilities due to its pure play natural gas LDC profile. There are some investors who believe LDC utilities have less “disruptive technology” exposure on the horizon than electric utilities with their issues of distributed power, micro-grids, and competitive power markets where some nuclear power plants are shutting down due to an auction-based short-term pricing scheme.Historically, LDC have traded at a premium PE to electric utilities. According to an article by S&P Global Insights, historically LDCs have traded at a 16% premium to electric utility PE ratios, as was the case as recently as Jan 2019. However, during the “Great Swan Dive” of March 2020 and amid growing concern about future natural gas availability, the premium slipped to a -6% discount, but has since rebounded to a positive premium spread of around 4%. However, bucking this trend, ATO current trades at a substantial discount to the PE ratios of WEC and XEL.I hope readers have found this 4-part series to be thought-provoking and useful. Thanks for reading.Author’s Note: Below is the spreadsheet of the seven companies that qualify for inclusion in the Best of the Best Utilities.The states consider by RRA as being More Constructive/Above Average #2: Alabama, Virginia, and Wisconsin. States considered More Constructive/Above Average #3: Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Indiana, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania."
4311292,20599,2019-12-08T19:35:08-05:00,Xcel Energy is up 26-fold over the last two decades.Destination 2050 is a goal to reach 100% clean energy.Electric vehicles strong adoption presents a huge opportunity for the daring investor.,"Perhaps not the energy miracle Bill Gates refers too, but still, a miracle by any investor's standard – Xcel Energy (XEL) is up 26 (twenty-six!) fold in the last 17 years, pushing to new highs repeatedly. Even the 2008 financial crisis, when the global equity markets suffered, seems just a bump in the road for Xcel. Can it still move higher, or it is to late to get in?As a company providing energy to homes and businesses in eight Midwestern and Western states, Xcel is an industry leader in renewable energy, continuously improves its carbon and other emissions, and already invests heavily to make the most of the electric industry trends.One of the biggest opportunities is to boost long-term revenue via electrification in the transportation sector as electric vehicle adoption rises. It may sound like not enough to boost a company further, but the figures for the next years tell a different story.US roads expect 20 million electric vehicles by 2030, a staggering number when compared with the 1.1 million in 2019. Amazon (AMZN) only recently ordered a hundred-thousand electric delivery vans to hit the road between 2021 and 2024. Moreover, by 2025, some 40k heavy-duty electric vehicles will be active in the United States and Europe.We can go on with the numbers, but that's not the point. What matters is the tremendous potential ahead – utilities that are preparing for the electric vehicles growth potential have many opportunities in the years to come.The transition to clean energy implies heavy investment in charging infrastructure, new technologies to explore new business models (e.g., blockchain to enable customers to make the most of their rooftop solar or managed electric vehicle charging), but also a commitment to reduce CO2 by all means. According to the company’s website, it plans to reduce carbon emissions more than 30% by 2030 and provide 100% clean energy by 2050.One of the latest Lead-Lag Reports I wrote mentioned that in Q3 2019, the largest earnings growth was witnessed in the utility sector, while the energy sector suffered the biggest decline in earnings growth.With a strong cash position and foothold in the US utility market, Xcel Energy looks poised to take advantage of industry opportunities. Challenges ahead do exist – growing cyber risk, preparing and responding to natural disasters, etc.But the company’s price chart shows an unstoppable series of higher highs and higher lows for the last seventeen years. A correction may be in the cards, but each trendline on the chart below represents just another opportunity to participate in one of the most notable rallies in the last decades.Why would it stop now when the world shifts to clean energy and people open their eyes to climate change all over the world?*Like this article?

4320687,40101,2020-01-31T16:21:04-05:00,"In mid-January, news of Xcel Energy's plans to accelerate closing a Texas coal-fired plant wasn't necessarily surprising for a utility targeting to be the first to eliminate its carbon footprint.Yet, the acceleration of the date isn't about coal. It's about water.When Moody's included water shortages as a threat to regulated electric utilities' credit in a research note just days later, it seemed prudent to explore the warning.","It's always wise to look beyond a headline. One of the most recent, with a warning including Xcel Energy (XEL), seemed to misconstrue the rating company's message. As a current Xcel shareholder, I intend to ignore the warning.Xcel Energy is an electric and natural gas utility operating in eight states - Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Colorado, Texas, and New Mexico. The utility plans to be the first in the United States to totally eliminate its carbon emission footprint. Its target date is 2050.So, it wasn't a surprise to see a headline touting the company had decided to close down a coal-fired plant in Texas a decade early. It was a surprise to see a second headline suggesting such infrastructure changes could ""potentially be a credit concern"".Xcel Energy's Tolk Generating Station, in the Texas panhandle, consists of two units capable of producing 1,067 MW of power.SourceIt is fueled by coal shipped in from the Powder River Basin. The facility was specifically designed to accommodate the arid environment. The station started serving customers in Texas and New Mexico in the 1980s.In 2010, Tolk was named ""Plant of the Year"" by the Powder River Basin Coal User's Group. The award was partially based on the plant's environmental stewardship.So much can change in a decade.The Powder River Basin spans northeast Wyoming and southeast Montana and produces over 40% of the coal consumed in the United States. Because coal from the region has a low sulfur content, it is primarily used for the generation of electricity.SourceProduction from the region peaked in 2008. Since then, the usage of natural gas and renewables to produce electricity has displaced the usage of coal. In 2019, two of the primary mining companies operating in the region filed bankruptcy, Cloud Peak in May and Blackjewel in July.But, the acceleration of the Tolk plant retirement isn't about coal or the industry pressures in the Powder River Basin. Rather, it's an issue of water supply.The Tolk plant relies on groundwater from the Ogallala Aquifer, a reservoir spanning 174,000 square miles in eight states in the Midwest.SourceIt provides water to nearly 1/5 of the production of wheat, corn, cotton, and cattle in the United States. For at least a decade, the USDA has recognized consumption relying on the aquifer is unsustainable.According to Utility Dive, the accelerated retirement plan for the Tolk plant was prompted by Senate Bill 489 in New Mexico signed into law in March 2019.Obviously, the original retirement date of 2042 would have met the state's requirements. But, Xcel's subsidiary, Southwestern Public Services, had already determined the water wouldn't last that long, even if it only operated seasonally. Its 2019 rate case application included plans to idle Tolk in 2032.Xcel had requested $51 million with the 2019 application in New Mexico.SourceNew Mexico's Public Regulation Commission authorized $31 million in base rate revenue increases. It also stipulated the utility must conduct ""a robust analysis"" on how it will replace Tolk's electric generation to support the updated target date. These results are to be submitted with the 2021 rate case application.Just days after Xcel's rate base approval in New Mexico, Moody's issued a research announcement warning climate hazards impacting regulated electric utilities could threaten traditional business models. The research addressed higher temperatures, water shortages, storm intensity, and flooding.One of Xcel's financial objectives is to ""maintain senior secured debt credit ratings in the A range"". Southwestern Public Services has an A3 credit rating with Moody's. Obviously, being included in Moody's narrative, relative to the utility's exposure to water shortages, would warrant concern.Yet, Moody's research note focused its concern on a longer-term view.The ongoing concern seemed to be more related to how the costs from potential damage will be absorbed.On that note, it would seem Xcel Energy shareholders would be much less concerned about the second headline."

That plan includes:As a result, coal becomes a smaller portion of the company's asset base.Source: Xcel Energy: Goldman Sachs Conference, August 2020In 2019, the City of Boulder chose to pursue its clean energy policy by offering to buy Xcel Energy's assets located inside the city for $93.96 million, which the city stated was double the original cost of the assets, less depreciation.This effort stumbled as the coronavirus caused a downturn in the local economy, caused the city to reconsider whether starting a municipal utility was the best use of its financial assets, and led to the current settlement with the company.On July 28, 2020, the city and Xcel came to a tentative agreement, which they are calling a new partnership that includes:Source: City of Boulder, ColoradoMany utilities, like Xcel Energy, are moving towards renewable energy, but the challenge for Xcel is its current debt load, which totals $23 billion or, to put it another way, it carries a debt/equity ratio of 173%. The company posted negative changes to net working capital for 2017, 2018, and 2019.Annual cash from operations continues to hover around $3.1 to $3.2 billion per year, and current plans are contingent upon a continued low interest rate environment.Source: Xcel Energy: Goldman Sachs Conference, August 2020The company's capitalization stands at approximately 51% long-term debt and 40% equity.

In May, citizens of Pueblo, Colorado, voted to continue to receive electricity from Black Hills Energy, although citizens' Electric Utility Commission (EUC) made up of residents continues to consider the viability of a municipal electric utility.Citizens of Pueblo are watching how the Boulder-Xcel agreement unfolds, as it will influence the future direction of Pueblo's EUC.Black Hills has proposed building a 200-megawatt solar project in Pueblo County, Colorado, which may dampen some of the opposition to the utility.Source: Black Hills Energy 2020 Q2 PresentationEven though electric utilities are making progress in adopting renewable energy, they will continue to feel pressure from customers who feel that their progress is too slow.There are several positive effects in moving towards renewable energy, including a cleaner environment and gaining support from customers who can influence decisions by state regulators concerning the utility's future rate requests.For Xcel Energy shareholders, acceptance of this new ""partnership"" between the City of Boulder and Xcel Energy will accelerate efforts to move Xcel Energy towards renewable energy and lower emissions and increase customer satisfaction with the company.For a regulated utility, support from customers is a valuable consideration for state regulators when considering changes in rate structures.These opportunities can lead to a faster transformation of the company and an improved long-range outlook for the company, which benefits all stakeholders, including shareholders."
4354733,103321,2020-06-19T15:12:57-04:00,Xcel Energy delivered a poor Q1 2020 due to unfavorable weather in its services territories.The company has 5-year $22 billion capital projects to support its long-term EPS growth of 5% - 7% annually.Xcel has a solid balance sheet to fund its growth projects and currently pays a growing 2.6%-yielding dividend.,"Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) saw its Q1 2020 results declined due to unfavorable weather. The company expects COVID-19 to impact its earnings in Q2 2020 but is implementing initiatives to reduce its operating and maintenance expenses. The company has 5-year $22 billion capital projects to grow its rate base by about 6.7% annually through 2024. It also has a solid balance sheet to support these projects. Xcel pays a growing 2.6%-yielding dividend with a sustainable payout ratio. In fact, we see a total return of 15.2% by the end of 2022. Hence, this is a good stock to own for investors seeking both dividend growth and capital appreciation.Data by YChartsXcel delivered an unimpressive Q1 2020 with an EPS of $0.56 per share in Q1 2020. This was about 10% lower than last year’s $0.61 per share. The decline was primarily due to warmer than normal weather in Q1 2020 compared to cooler than normal weather in Q1 2019.Source: Q1 2020 Presentation$22 billion of capital projects between 2020 and 2024Xcel has 5-year $22 billion capital projects between 2020 and 2024. These investments include a combination of electric distribution, transmission, generation, renewables, and natural gas projects. These projects should help grow its rate base from $30 billion in 2019 to $41.9 billion. This represents an annual growth rate of 6.7%. We think these projects will help Xcel to reach its long-term EPS growth target of 5% - 7% annually.Source: June 2020 Investor PresentationThe impact of COVID-19 should gradually recede in H2 2020The outbreak of coronavirus in the U.S. is impacting Xcel’s sales in Q2 2020. As can be illustrated from the chart below, total retail electricity sales declined by 9.6% in April driven by a significant decline in commercial and industrial electricity sales but offset by 3.2% growth in residential electricity sales. Xcel’s electricity sales in May improved from April as stay-at-home orders relax in its services territories. However, total retail electricity sales still went down by 6.7% year over year. We expect sales to improve in the second half of 2020 as commercial and industrial activities resume. To help mitigate this loss in revenue, management is implementing a cost restructuring program to reduce its operating and maintenance expenses and should reduce its O&M expenses by about 4% annually. Although management reiterated its annual EPS guidance of about $2.73 - $2.83 per share, we think reaching the low end of its guidance is probably the most likely outcome, given uncertainties related to COVID-19.Source: June 2020 Investor PresentationA solid balance sheet to support its capital projectsXcel has an investment grade balance sheet with credit ratings of Baa1 (Moody’s) and BBB+ (S&P, Fitch). The company has a total liquidity of $5.9 billion on June 12, 2020. Xcel has a strong balance sheet with total debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.9x and funds from operations to debt ratio of about 17%. The company has a solid plan to fund its 5-year capital expenditures. As can be seen from the chart below, over 60% of its planned capital expenditures will be funded through its cash flow from operations. About 30% of this expenditure will be funded through incremental debt, and the rest will be funded through equity issuance.Source: June 2020 Investor PresentationXcel should be able to grow its EPS by about 6% annually. Using this annual target, its EPS could reach $2.95 per share and $3.12 per share in 2021 and 2022, respectively. Xcel has been trading at an average P/E ratio of about 22.1x in the past 3 years. Using a P/E ratio of 22x, we reach target prices of $64.83 by the end of 2021 and $68.72 by the end of 2022. Together with its dividend, we have a total return of 6.1% by the end of 2021 and 15.2% by the end of 2022.Source: Created by authorA growing 2.6%-yielding dividendXcel pays a quarterly dividend of $0.43 per share. This is equivalent to a dividend yield of about 2.6%. The company has consistently raised its dividend in the past. As can be seen from the chart below, its dividend yield of 2.6% is towards the low end of its 10-year yield range. Xcel’s dividend is sustainable with a target payout ratio of about 60% - 70% of its EPS.Xcel faces several risks:(1) Xcel Energy faces regulatory risk. A lengthy period of low interest rates could result in lower allowed return on equity.(2) Adverse weather may impact the demand for electricity.(3) Multiple waves of pandemic may cause lower electricity demand in the second half of 2020 and 2021.Xcel’s regulated utilities business should continue to grow thanks to its investment projects. In fact, we see a total return of about 15.2% by the end of 2022 and believe this is a good stock to own for investors with a long-term investment horizon seeking dividend income and modest capital appreciation."
4332299,80836,2020-03-16T16:04:46-04:00,"I have been analyzing two utility companies in the past month and preferred one over the other.In this article I am going to look whether the market sell-off has made another utility company an attractive investment opportunity.I will analyze the fundamentals and valuation of Xcel Energy, and try to determine whether the current risks and opportunities are attractive enough.","In previous article I analyzed two utility companies. This sector was a little overvalued before the Corona outbreak, and I am looking at some opportunities in it. I found that CenterPoint Energy (CNP) was more attractive when compared to American Electric Power (AEP). I am willing to look further into this sector.In this article I am going to look into Xcel Energy (XEL), which is another utility company that unlike many of its peers shows higher than average growth. Many of these companies seem boring by investors and are overlooked.In this article, I will analyze XEL using the graph below. I will analyze the fundamentals, the valuation, the growth opportunities and the risks. I will try to determine whether it's a good investment on its own, and whether it's superior to the peers I analyzed.(Graph made by author)According to Seeking Alpha:(Source: www.xcelenergy.com)Over the last decade the company achieved very little revenue growth. However, this growth rate is typical in the sector. The utility companies are regulated and cannot raise prices when they want to. The company's projects will allow it to keep showing low single digits top line growth.Data by YChartsThe bottom line is far more impressive, and XEL managed to achieve in the last decade an impressive growth rate for a utility. While many of its peers show low to mid-single digits growth, XEL achieved mid to high single digits growth rate. Analysts believe that the growth rate will continue at around 6%-7% in the medium term.Data by YChartsThe current 2.5% entry yield is rather low when compared to the company's own historical data. While 6% growth with 2.5% dividend may be attractive, I still believe that investors should strive for a more attractive entry point. However, there are exceptions, and I won't ever disqualify a company for the entry yield. In addition, the payout ratio is highly conservative when compared to its peers.Data by YChartsIn the past decade the company has been diluting its shareholders. Some utility companies do it as they refrain from buying back their shares and still use shares for acquisition and compensation packages. In this case it is more disappointing, because as I stated the payout ratio is conservative, so the company could at least negate the dilution.Data by YChartsThe current P/E ratio is extremely rich. I find it really hard to justify such a rich valuation. The current forward P/E is over 25, and it puts XEL closer to companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG)(GOOGL), than to its industry peers, so investors should be cautious here.Data by YChartsThe graph below from fastgrahs.com shows how the stock price disconnected from the fundamentals. The average P/E ratio is 15.52 and even when we take into account the lower interest rates, I just cannot justify the current valuation using the fundamentals shown above.(Source: Fastgraphs.com)XEL is a company with strong fundamentals. The company has a healthy payout ratio and enjoys decent bottom line growth that will keep supporting dividend growth in the foreseeable future. While the fundamentals are solid, the current valuation cannot be justified. In the next paragraphs, I will look into the future opportunities as I try to determine whether they may justify this rich valuation.There is a positive regulatory environment for XEL. It's an extremely big opportunity as the company is relying on its cooperation with the regulators to raise prices. Resolving regulatory proceeding in different jurisdictions will allow the company to raise prices and improve top and bottom line.The company is also participating in the global fight to slow down climate change. The company is becoming greener and is buying and building wind facilities. Being environmentally friendly is helpful to the company's image and brand and will make it easier to justify price hikes in the future.The management team is extremely successful and tend to reach its goals. I appreciate talented managers, and I believe that that they can bring the alpha with their skills. The company exceeded its goals for more than a decade, and they managed to bring significant projects online and negotiate good deals with regulators.The level of uncertainty in the markets right now is extremely high. The coronavirus crisis is weighting on the markets, and investors in XEL have no margin of safety. I find the current valuation unjustified. Even in an optimist case, the shares are priced for perfection, and offer no margin of safety in case of recession or even a slowdown.The growth rate under the optimistic scenario is simply not attractive enough. Yes, the management is more than capable, but even under their own assumptions they cannot achieve a growth rate that can justify the premium. The company should be able to achieve low double digits growth rate in order to justify such valuation.In addition, the company also has to deal with demographic challenges. While it operates in growing markets like Texas, it also operates in more challenging markets in the northern part of the country. These areas have lower population growth rate, and the population is not as dense. It also poses a challenge that XEL has to deal with.XEL is a solid company. The fundamentals are strong, with growing top and bottom line. The dividend is safe, and keeps growing, and even the dilution is not too harsh. However, the future growth opportunities, while overcoming the risks cannot justify the current valuation in my opinion.Therefore, when I look at all three companies, I prefer CNP over its two peers. The dividend is safe, and the enticing entry yield will help investors achieve decent returns as they wait for the market to calm, and for new projects to come online. AEP and XEL are decent companies, with unattractive valuation."
4288248,104980,2019-08-27T16:17:00-04:00,"Having raised its dividend for the past 16 years, Xcel Energy is a Dividend Contender.Despite the risks, Xcel Energy is likely to continue to deliver satisfactory earnings growth for its shareholders because of its strong management team and growth plan.Unfortunately, the company is trading at a 23% premium to fair value and poses 19% downside from the current price.Between the 2.6% yield, likely 5-6% earnings growth, and 2.1% annual valuation multiple contraction, Xcel Energy is likely to perform in line with the market, delivering 5.5-6.5% annual total returns over the next decade.I would rate Xcel Energy a buy at a 3.4% yield. Between that, the 5-6% earnings growth, and 0.6% average annual expansion in the valuation multiple, the company would deliver 9.0-10.0% annual total returns over the next decade.","In spite of the volatility that has returned to the market recently and the S&P 500 falling 4.5% for the month of August thus far, the S&P is still up over 13% YTD.One sector that has held up well for a couple of reasons has been the utilities sector. The S&P 500 Utilities index is up over 17% YTD and this has led to overvaluation throughout most of the utility sector.The 25 basis point rate cut a few weeks ago has contributed to both increased interest in the utility sector as an alternative to bonds and also will have a favorable impact on the earnings of utilities as most utilities tend to have higher debt loads compared to other sectors due to the capital intensive nature of the utility industry.Image Source: GurufocusUnfortunately, I believe the utility sector as a whole is slightly overpriced to moderately overpriced, and there are very few utilities that I would rate as a buy at this time.The Shiller PE ratio is close to a 5 year high for utilities at over 30, which means that now isn't an ideal time to buy most utilities.One of the many utilities that I believe to be overvalued is Xcel Energy (XEL). Although the company's Shiller PE ratio of 29 is a bit below the utility sector's Shiller PE of 30.9, the company is still moderately overvalued in my opinion.I'll be discussing Xcel Energy's dividend safety and growth profile, the company's fundamentals and key risks to consider, as well as the valuation perspective of an investment in Xcel Energy.I'll then close with my estimated annual total returns over the next decade for Xcel Energy and by offering the price at which I would rate shares of Xcel Energy a buy. Aside from the fundamentals of a company, two of the most important considerations for a dividend growth investor are the safety of a company's dividend and the growth of that dividend in the future.In order to determine the safety of Xcel Energy's dividend, I'll be examining the company's EPS payout ratio. While I typically like to examine the FCF payout ratio as well, this isn't particularly useful to investors because utilities generally have negative FCF. And in the case of a utility, that isn't an issue because as long as earnings are growing in excess of share issuances, the utility will be able to continue to increase its dividend.In its previous fiscal year, Xcel Energy generated EPS of $2.47 against a dividend obligation of $1.52 for dividends per share declared in 2018, for an EPS payout ratio of 61.5%.Looking at this fiscal year, Xcel Energy recently reaffirmed its 2019 EPS guidance of $2.55-$2.65. Against the $1.62 in dividends per share slated to be paid out in 2019, this equates to a 62.3% EPS payout ratio using the midpoint EPS figure of $2.60.When we consider that Simply Safe Dividends considers an EPS payout ratio below 75% to be safe, Xcel Energy's dividend is clearly safe for the foreseeable future.Image Source: Simply Safe DividendsWhen we consider what I alluded to above, it should come as no surprise that Simply Safe Dividends and I agree that Xcel Energy's dividend is safe for the foreseeable future.With that in mind, we'll now discuss the growth prospects for the company's dividend moving forward.Image Source: Simply Safe DividendsWhen we consider that Xcel Energy's EPS payout ratio is in the low 60% range and that there is a bit of room for expansion in the payout ratio without sacrificing dividend safety, it seems likely that the payout ratio will expand into the mid to high 60% range over time. This means that the company's dividend growth could slightly exceed earnings growth over the long-term.In support of my thesis of a continuation of Xcel Energy's mid-single digit dividend growth, Yahoo! Finance and Nasdaq are projecting 5.8% and 4.9% annual earnings growth over the next 5 years, respectively.Next, we'll delve into the reasons why I believe Xcel Energy will be able to deliver the mid-single digit earnings growth necessary to support mid-single digit dividend growth over the long-term.Image Source: Xcel Energy Canada Investor Meetings PresentationXcel Energy is a major U.S. regulated electric and natural gas delivery company which serves customers in eight mid-western and western states, including parts of Michigan, Colorado, Minnesota, North Dakota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.Xcel Energy serves 3.6 million electric customers and 2.0 million natural gas customers on a rate base of $27 billion.Xcel Energy is divided into the following four operating companies:NSP-Minnesota: According to page 6 of Xcel Energy's most recent 10-K, NSP-Minnesota conducts business in Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota. The company has electric operations in all three states, including the generation, purchase, transmission, and distribution and sale of electricity. NSP-Minnesota also purchases, transports, distributes and sells natural gas to retail customers and transports customer-owned natural gas in Minnesota and North Dakota. The company accounted for 35-45% of consolidated earnings in 2018.NSP-Wisconsin: NSP-Wisconsin conducts business in Wisconsin and Michigan, and generates, transmits, distributes and sells electricity. The company also purchases, transports, distributes and sells natural gas to retail customers and transports customer-owned natural gas. The company accounted for 5-10% of consolidated earnings in 2018.PSCo: According to page 7 of Xcel Energy's most recent 10-K, PSCo conducts business in Colorado and generates, purchases, transmits, distributes and sells electricity in addition to purchasing, transporting, distributing and selling natural gas to retail customers and transporting customer-owned natural gas. The company accounted for 35-45% of consolidated earnings in 2018.SPS: SPS conducts business in Texas and New Mexico and generates, purchases, transmits, distributes and sells electricity. The segment accounted for 15-20% of consolidated earnings in 2018.Now that we have a better understanding of Xcel Energy and how the company generates its revenue and earnings, we'll delve into the growth story for the company in the years ahead.Image Source: Xcel Energy Canada Investor Meetings PresentationThe bulk of the company's growth will be derived from its capital investment plan that involves investing over $20 billion to expand its base rate. This rate base growth is expected to contribute to 6.5% average annual rate base growth through 2023. Xcel Energy is also forecasting an additional $1 billion of capital spending in 2022 and 2023 for unidentified capital projects that could come to fruition during the forecast period via incremental projects.As part of its commitment to serve all customers with 100% zero-carbon emissions by 2050, Renewables will comprise 18% of Xcel Energy's capital spending. Image Source: Xcel Energy Canada Investor Meetings PresentationThe above illustration shows Xcel Energy's commitment to expanding upon its renewable energy infrastructure in the years ahead to meet its goal of zero-carbon emissions by 2050. The 2,950 MW in construction that will be completed by 2021 moves the company closer to its zero-carbon emissions goal.Fortunately for Xcel Energy, the company also operates in states that are highly advantageous for above-average electricity generation. For instance, New Mexico ranks as second in the nation for potential solar-generated electric power production and tenth in wind potential.Image Source: Xcel Energy June 2019 Investor PresentationAs far as the logistics of the company's 5 year capital spending plan is concerned, Xcel Energy expects to fund its 5 year growth plan primarily with over $13 billion in operating cash flow, with the remainder of funding for its capital projects coming from the refinancing of long-term debt, incremental debt, and the issuance of equity.Image Source: Xcel Energy Canada Investor Meetings PresentationXcel Energy has show itself to be reliable in meeting or exceeding its initial guidance, which demonstrates an ability of management to deliver on their promises. This has allowed the company to consistently deliver mid-single digit EPS growth and dividend growth.It's for that reason I fully believe the company will be able to deliver upon its 5-7% EPS growth target over the long-term. It doesn't deviate from what management has proven it is capable of delivering in the past. I also don't believe Xcel Energy's fundamentals have detrimentally changed to alter the growth story, and I have utmost confidence in the management team to continue with the status quo in terms of EPS growth.Speaking of the management team, I believe it would be worthwhile to outline the experience of Xcel Energy's key members in its solid management team.Chairman of the Board, President and CEO Ben Fowke has served in his current positions since his appointment in August 2011. Prior to his current roles, Mr. Fowke served as President and COO from 2009 to 2011. Mr. Fowke served as CFO and Vice President with the company before he was appointed President and COO. Prior to the 2000 merger of Northern States Power Co. and New Century Energies to form what is now Xcel Energy, Mr. Fowke was a VP in the NCE Retail business unit. Prior to joining the company, Mr. Fowke also held management positions with FPL Group (now a part of NextEra Energy).Simply put, Mr. Fowke boasts over 3 decades of experience in the utility industry.CFO Bob Frenzel joined Xcel Energy in 2016 from Energy Future Holdings, where he served as Senior VP and CFO for Luminant, its competitive power generating subsidiary, and prior to that position, Mr. Frenzel served as Senior VP of Strategy and Corporate Development. Prior to his experience in the utility industry, Mr. Frenzel worked as a VP in the Investment Banking division of Goldman Sachs. Following college, Mr. Frenzel worked as a nuclear engineering officer and weapons officer in the United States Navy.It's clear that two of the key executives at Xcel Energy both possess the necessary industry experience to continue to guide Xcel Energy into the future as an environmental leader.Image Source: Xcel Energy Canada Investor Meetings Presentation Adding to the case for an investment in Xcel Energy is the fact that the company also possesses investment grade credit ratings of Baa1, BBB+, and BBB+ from the three major credit rating agencies.This is because of Xcel Energy's fairly conservative balance sheet for a utility. The company's expected debt/EBITDA ratio of 4.7 is well below what Simply Safe Dividends considers to be a desirable debt/EBITDA ratio for a utility. For context, Simply Safe Dividends considers a debt/EBITDA ratio of below 5.5 to be a preferential ratio.There is quite a bit to like about Xcel Energy from a growth perspective due to its ambitious but reasonable growth plan, the company's capable management team, and its reasonably strong balance sheet. It is for the foregoing reasons I believe Xcel Energy has the potential to be a great long-term investment at the right price, which we'll analyze after covering the key risks to Xcel Energy.While Xcel Energy is a high-quality utility, that doesn't mean the company doesn't come without risks, and below are what I believe to be a few of the key risks associated with an investment in Xcel Energy.The first risk to a natural gas utility is the possibility of a leak, explosion, or outage, which could all result in material losses for Xcel Energy (page 18 of Xcel Energy's most recent 10-K ). These losses could be immediate in the sense that outages lead to lost revenue for utilities and events such as the first two referenced above could result in significant legal settlements or fines against the company, not to mention the negative impact on Xcel Energy's reputation as a company.Another operating risk is from a planning perspective. Because the electric utility industry is undergoing significant changes currently, there is the possibility that adoption of increased energy efficiency technologies could result in excess transmission for Xcel Energy, which would weigh on the company's financial results if it isn't able to fully recover its costs and investment (page 18 of Xcel Energy's most recent 10-K).The final notable operating risk to Xcel Energy that is arguably the most remote possibility is an accident at either of its two nuclear stations in Minnesota (page 19 of Xcel Energy's most recent 10-K).Although nuclear power plant accidents are quite rare, they can be absolutely devastating to an entire geographic area and a severe enough event at one of Xcel Energy's power plants or any nuclear power plant for that matter could result in additional compliance costs for the entire industry.While Xcel Energy's dividend appears to be quite safe, a major nuclear power plant accident would have a materially negative impact on the company's future dividend growth, and the company would likely be required to cut its dividend from both a financial and PR standpoint. Even if the nuclear disaster was a complete accident or fluke and the company played no part in it, maintaining/raising dividends or paying bonuses to executives in the midst of significant human suffering and the upending of many lives would be the worst thing a company could do to its reputation, and would certainly attractive negative attention from the media and regulatory authorities (and deservedly so, if I may add).A nuclear power plant accident would likely not only increase compliance costs across the entire industry, but it would also result in a more negative perception toward Xcel Energy and potentially massive legal settlements or fines against the company.A financial risk to the utility industry as a whole that I've alluded to in previous utility articles is the fact that while utilities have typically been very steady through recessions in terms of generating earnings, Yale economist and law professor Yair Listokin argues that lowering utility rates on the verge of a recession or in the midst of one could be an effective method of combating a recession, along with other measures.Listokin argues that while this could have a detrimental impact on the steadiness of utilities, there could be measures put in place to ensure that during expansionary economic periods, utilities are able to achieve their expected rates of return on their rate base.The end result would be the same, but it would come at the cost of slightly less steady utility performance around recessionary periods.Along the lines of less steady utility performance due to varying allowed rates of return, another risk is that Xcel Energy's allowed returns on equity are subject to the approval of the regulatory authorities in the states they operate. If these states aren't as favorable with their allowed rates of return in the future, this could be detrimental to Xcel Energy's financial results going forward.While the above risks are what I believe to be the most notable associated with an investment in Xcel Energy, I should note that these risks are certainly not the only risks. I would refer interested readers to pages 18-23 of the company's most recent 10-K for a more comprehensive listing of the risks facing Xcel Energy.Now that we've established Xcel Energy is an excellent utility with decent growth prospects, we'll delve into the one aspect that is preventing me from rating Xcel Energy a buy, which is valuation.The first valuation metric we'll use to determine the extent to which Xcel Energy is overvalued is the 5 year average dividend yield.According to Simply Safe Dividends, Xcel Energy's current yield of 2.59% is well below its 5 year average of 3.28%. Assuming a reversion to a 3% fair value yield and a stock price of $54.00 a share (to compensate for the very low interest rates, but the added risk of investing in an equity compared to bonds), shares of Xcel Energy are trading at a 15.5% premium to fair value and pose 13.4% downside from the current price of $62.35 a share (as of August 25, 2019).The next valuation method we'll use to arrive at a fair value for Xcel Energy is the 5 year average forward PE ratio.According to Simply Safe Dividends, Xcel Energy's forward PE ratio of 23.1 is elevated compared to its 5 year average forward PE ratio of 18.7.Even assuming a reversion to a forward PE ratio of 19 and a fair value of $51.28, shares of Xcel Energy are trading at a 21.6% premium to fair value and pose 17.7% downside from the current price.Image Source: InvestopediaThe final valuation method I'll use to assign a fair value to shares of Xcel Energy is the dividend discount model or DDM.The first input into the DDM is the expected dividend per share, which is simply the annualized dividend per share. In the case of Xcel Energy, that amount is currently $1.62.The next input into the DDM is the cost of capital equity, which is another term for the rate of return that an investor requires from an investment. I require a 10% rate of return because I believe that adequately rewards me for the time and effort I spend on both researching and occasionally monitoring investments.The third and final input into the DDM is the long-term dividend growth rate. Unsurprisingly, readers that have been following me for any length of time would know that this is the most difficult input to consider because of the numerous factors that determine an investment's dividend growth rate.When we look at Xcel Energy's EPS dividend payout ratio in the low 60% range, it's a reasonable conclusion to assume that dividend growth could slightly exceed earnings growth in the years ahead and the payout ratio could potentially expand to the high 60% range. Given the 5-6% earnings growth expected over the next 5 years, I believe it's fair to conclude that Xcel Energy will deliver a 6.5% long-term dividend growth rate for investors.This gives us a fair value of $46.29 a share, which means that shares of Xcel Energy are trading at a 34.7% premium to fair value and pose 25.8% downside from the current price.When we average the three fair values, we arrive at a fair value of $50.52 a share. This indicates that shares of Xcel Energy are trading at a 23.4% premium to fair value and pose 19.0% downside from the current price.Xcel Energy operates in an industry that is necessary to our daily lives and that's one of the main reasons the company has been able to increase its dividend each year for the past 16 years, making it a Dividend Contender.Xcel Energy will be investing over $20 billion in projects over the next 5 years, which, along with occasional rate increases, will allow the company to continue with its mid-single digit dividend growth rate for many years to come. In addition, the company boasts an investment grade credit rating and an experienced management team to help the company navigate any obstacles on the way to implementing its vision for the future.At its current price, Xcel Energy offers a 2.6% yield, along with 5-6% earnings growth, and 2.1% annual valuation multiple contraction over the next decade based upon my fair value estimate. While Xcel Energy is quite likely to perform in line with the broader market over the next decade, I don't believe this is an adequate entry point from both a dividend yield standpoint and a total return standpoint.I would rate Xcel Energy a buy below $48 a share or at a 3.4%+ yield. Between a 3.4% yield, 5-6% earnings growth, and 0.6% average annual expansion in the valuation multiple, the company would deliver 9.0-10.0% annual total returns over the next decade."
4355121,104097,2020-06-23T04:52:54-04:00,"Normally, utility companies are seen as a safe and reliable source of dividend income, such as Xcel Energy, but the analysis of their finances should still not be skipped.Although I have nothing against debt-funded growth, it does not matter what type of company it is, the leverage cannot continue increasing indefinitely.Since 2013, Xcel Energy's free cash flow has always been negative, and thus, it is reliant on debt to fund its dividend payments, which has helped increase it significantly.This has resulted in the company's leverage increasing despite it also raising around $1 billion of equity. If this trend does not change within the medium term, it will pose a risk to the dividend.When all of the considerations discussed in this article are combined, I believe that a Neutral rating is appropriate.","Generally speaking, since most investors treat large utilities such as Xcel Energy (XEL) as safe and reliable sources for dividend income, some investors may then question the validity of assessing their leverage and, thus, dividend sustainability. Whilst this may have worked well in the past, given the company's heavy reliance on debt funding, this may not always be the situation. It does not matter what type of company, its leverage cannot continue increasing indefinitely.Thankfully, the graphs largely speak for themselves, with the first three graphs included below summarizing the company's cash flows and debt from the last quarter and previous seven years.(Image Source: Author)Xcel Energy's historical cash flow was primarily provided to provide context and frame the subsequent analysis of the company's financial position. It can be seen that whilst it has varied across the years, it has never been positive, with the surge in capital expenditure during the first quarter of 2020 weighing it down further year on year. Although this is seldom a positive sign for a dividend investment, since it stems from relatively high capital expenditure, the company's overall financial health may not be deteriorating if these investments are producing sufficient returns.(Image Source: Author)Since Xcel Energy has never produced any free cash flow, it naturally stands to reason that the company's dividend coverage has always been negative, despite it always being easily covered by net income. Whilst some investors may feel that net income coverage provides an adequate assessment of dividend coverage, I beg to differ, since dividends are ultimately paid from cash, and thus, using net income does not capture the true impacts to its financial position. Since the beginning of 2013, the company's dividend payments have totaled $4.809 billion, which were all clearly funded through debt, as its free cash flow was negative $4.647 billion during this same period of time. It is highly questionable if that can be sustainable in the long term, as the company's earnings would have to increase sufficiently to offset the additional debt used to fund both its negative free cash flow and dividend payments.(Image Source: Author)Following the company's previously discussed negative free cash flow and debt-funded dividend payments, it comes as no surprise that its net debt has been steadily expanding every year. Since the end of 2013, it has increased 65.78% from $11.843 billion to $19.633 billion, despite the company also raising a total of $1.075 billion of equity net of share buybacks. Unlike many other companies, Xcel Energy did not take any action to boost its very low cash balance amidst the turmoil during the first quarter of 2020. However, generally speaking, liquidity is less of a concern for such companies.Whether this path of funding dividend payments through debt appears sustainable will depend upon its impact on the company's financial position. The two graphs included below summarizes Xcel Energy's financial position from the last quarter and previous three to seven years.(Image Source: Author)Even though its leverage is not necessarily excessive for a utility company, it can be observed that it has been increasing across all of these four primary financial metrics, which is a problematic trend in the medium to long term. To paint a further worsening picture, this has still eventuated despite Xcel Energy raising the aforementioned $1.075 billion of equity. If the company had used debt funding instead of equity funding, then its net debt-to-EBITDA at the end of the first quarter of 2020 would have been higher at 5.44 instead of 5.16. Considering interest rates have been heading towards record lows recently, it is rather concerning to see the company's interest coverage actually worsening to 2.55, which indicates that servicing its debt is beginning to become somewhat burdensome.Since this is not simply due to one-off events or the economic downturn during the first quarter of 2020, it indicates that Xcel Energy's leverage is not trending in a sustainable direction, as its earnings have failed to keep pace with higher debt levels. Whilst this is not at crisis levels for a utility company, it still indicates that a change will be required within the medium term.(Image Source: Author)Since the end of 2017, the company's liquidity has also deteriorated modestly, as evidenced by its current ratio decreasing from 0.73 to a quite low 0.51. Unlike many of its peers, Xcel Energy did not take any action in the first quarter of 2020 to boost its cash balance and thus liquidity. Similar to many other utility companies, Xcel Energy's liquidity is less of the question versus its leverage, as it is a fairly large company that provides critical infrastructure. This means that it would be difficult to imagine the company being completely unable to access adequate liquidity to remain a going concern, especially with the recent supportive central bank monetary policy.At the moment, it seems unlikely that leverage will cause any issues for its dividend. However, shareholders should continue monitoring the situation, as Xcel Energy operates in a capital-intensive industry, and thus far, it is trending in a worrying direction. Although investors can debate at what point the company's leverage would spell an end to its current dividend or stop any future growth, it does not change the fact that its leverage still has a limit and this recession is unlikely to help. After combining all these considerations, I believe that a Neutral rating is appropriate.Notes: Unless specified otherwise, all figures in this article were taken from Xcel Energy’s SEC filings, all calculated figures were performed by the author."
4261915,103213,2019-05-09T09:41:33-04:00,"Xcel Energy has a decent yield and good dividend potential.The stock has shown good momentum, although the valuation is now in uncharted territory.I would advise investors to not add more to their positions and to consider transitioning the position towards more undervalued utility stocks.","Note: This article wraps up our analysis of utilities for now. To have an overview of the 10 utility stocks we have analyzed during the past 18 days, read the following blog post: MAD Wrap Up: Utilities.Written By Sam KovacsXcel Energy (XEL) has a dividend yield of 2.90% and is trading at $56.51 per share. Based on my M.A.D. assessment, XEL has a dividend strength score of 85 and a stock strength score of 53.This article will present and discuss the factors which show why I believe that dividend investors shouldn't add to their positions in XEL.Source: mad-dividends.comXcel Energy Inc. manages utilities to serve over 3.5 million electric customers and 2.0 million natural gas customers across the United States. The company, through its subsidiary firms, operates the electric and gas business in US and Mexico.M.A.D. assessments are presented in two sections: dividend strength and stock strength.I look at stock and dividend strength as 2 distinct subjects. A high dividend strength score indicates that the company has a good combination of dividend safety, dividend yield, and dividend growth potential. Whereas a high stock strength score is an indicator that the share price is likely to increase in upcoming quarters. Dividend investors can expect to do well by investing in stocks which rank highly in both dividend strength and stock strength.Dividend strength can be broken down into a) dividend safety and b) dividend potential.Therefore, we can break down dividend strength into two dynamics: dividend safety and dividend potential.To evaluate the dividend safety, I will look at payout and coverage ratios. XEL's dividend potential will be derived by analyzing the current dividend yield as well as the history of revenue, net income, and dividend growth.Xcel Energy pays out 62% of earnings as dividends. This makes XEL's payout ratio better than 29% of dividend stocks.Operating cash flow payout also gives a good idea of a company's ability to pay its dividend and gives a more complete picture than simply looking at the earnings payout.XEL pays 25% of its operating cash flow as a dividend, putting it ahead of 50% of dividend stocks.Like many utility stocks, XEL generates negative free cash flow due to large amounts of CAPEX.Xcel Energy Inc.'s payout ratio is satisfying, according to these metrics.Source: mad-dividends.comAnalyzing interest and debt coverage ratios along payout ratios gives us an idea of the payout ratio's stability. If a lot of the company's earnings go towards paying interest, the financial leverage makes the company's bottom line more affected by variations in revenue.XEL can pay its interest 9 times, which is better than 78% of stocks. This level of coverage can be considered very satisfying for a utility.The company can cover all of its current debt 4 times. Xcel Energy has a better debt service coverage ratio than 43% of stocks. This is a lot higher than we usually see for utilities.Looking at payout and coverage ratios together would suggest that XEL's dividend is very safe.I then move on to analyzing the company's dividend potential (i.e.: its ability to pay us a good dividend which grows at a satisfying rate).Source: mad-dividends.comXcel Energy Inc.'s dividend yield of 2.90% is better than 64% of dividend stocks.This last year, the dividend grew 8%, which is higher than their 5-year CAGR of 6%.Source: mad-dividends.comOver the previous 3 years, Xcel Energy has seen its revenues grow at a 2% CAGR and net income by a 9% CAGR. It is important for a company to continue growing revenues and net income in order to continue paying and important for a dividend investor growing their dividends.Source: mad-dividendsIf the company can continue to grow its revenue and net income at the current rate, XEL's dividend has good potential for growth. While the stock's yield is at all-time lows, I expect the dividend to keep growing at a 6-8% rate.The data presented above gives XEL a dividend strength score of 85/100.The dividend is safe, no doubts. Revenue and net income have slowly been appreciating, enough to warrant continued dividend growth of 6-8% in upcoming years.When picking dividend stocks, investors must focus on more factors than dividends alone. To pick the most attractive dividend investments at any given point in time, we must also focus on other factors.Within the company's stock strength score, we look at four factors: value, momentum, financial strength and earnings quality.Each of these factors will be analyzed, one by one, to best understand the stock's underlying dynamics.It has been proven, time and time again, that undervalued stocks outperform overvalued stocks. To assess value, I look at a company's P/E, P/S, P/CFO, and Shareholder Yield. I combine them to give the stock a value score out of 100.Here are XEL's value ratios:These values would suggest that XEL is more undervalued than 71% of stocks, which is satisfying. Undervalued stocks tend to outperform their overvalued counterparts.Value Score: 71/100I also draw PE lines over a stock chart, very much like Peter Lynch would do while running the Magellan Fund. By doing so, investors get an idea of the company's PE range, and it serves as an indicator of potential downside and upside.Source: mad-dividends.comThe chart above suggests that XEL is trading above its 5-year average PE, and close to its 5-year maximum PE. This dampens the potential for price appreciation: while XEL is undervalued in comparison with the market, it is overvalued based on its historical PE range.Most dividend investors disregard momentum and are happy buying on the way down.But buying losing stocks is never a good idea, even if your main motivation is to receive a dividend.Xcel Energy Inc.' price has increased 7.78% these last 3 months, 15.00% these last 6 months, and 21.82% these last 12 months, and now, currently sits at $56.51.Source: mad-dividends.comXEL has better momentum than 79% of stocks, which is very encouraging. The top 25% of momentum stocks tend to outperform the market. XEL could continue to rise in 2019, although concerns about valuation could subdue returns in comparison with other utilities.Momentum Score: 79/100Stocks with good financial strength will have reasonable levels of debt, low liability growth - or even decreasing liabilities - and will produce high levels of cash flows in relation to their liabilities.Financially strong stocks have historically performed a lot better than companies with weak financials. It goes without saying that investors should be extra careful with stocks who dramatically increase their financial leverage.XEL's Debt/Equity ratio of 2.8 is better than 29% of stocks. Xcel Energy Inc.'s liabilities have increased by 7% this last year. Operating cash flow can cover 9.2% of XEL's liabilities.These ratios would suggest that Xcel Energy has better financial strength than 35% of stocks. This is at the lower end of the range, even for utility stocks which inherently have worse financial strength than the median US stock.Financial Strength Score: 35/100Stocks with high earnings quality will have low levels of accruals and will depreciate their capital expenses quickly. Their assets will also generate large amounts of revenue.Xcel Energy Inc.'s Total Accruals to Assets ratio of -12.7% puts it ahead of 62% of stocks.41.9% of XEL's capital expenditure is depreciated each year, which is better than 13% of stocks.Each dollar of XEL's assets generates $0.3 of revenue, putting it ahead of 28% of stocks.This makes XEL's earnings quality better than 25% of stocks. The asset turnover is just average for a utility; we do still appreciate the negative accruals. The low level of depreciation to capital expenditure hurts XEL's earnings quality.Earnings Quality Score: 25/100When combining the different factors of the stock's profile, we get a stock strength score of 53/100, which is average. The concerns about the valuation might be a headwind, despite good momentum. The fundamentals aren't as great as I would have expected them. While I expect XEL to continue appreciating in 2019, there are other utilities which I am more comfortable with.With a dividend strength score of 85 and a stock strength of 53, Xcel Energy is, at best, an okay choice for dividend investors.For investors who have been invested in XEL for a while and have enjoyed the appreciation in price, I'd advise holding the stock while it has good momentum and transitioning out of it and into other utilities if the valuation gets stretched. For those on the sidelines, place it on a watchlist, but don't initiate a position for now.Liked this article? Why not hit the orange follow button at the top of the page?

4284680,103321,2019-08-11T22:03:03-04:00,Xcel Energy is an electric and gas utilities company with a focus in Western and Midwestern states.The company has $20.1 billion of capital projects in the next 5 years to grow its business.Xcel should be able to take advantage of the above national average wind resources in its service territories.It pays a growing 2.6%-yielding dividend.,"Xcel Energy (XEL) delivered an unimpressive quarter, primarily due to weather-related issues. The company should be able to continue to grow its revenue, thanks to its 5-year $20.1 billion capital projects. Among these projects include renewable projects that will take advantage of the above national average wind resources in its service territories. The company has a solid balance sheet to support this growth. Xcel also pays a growing 2.6%-yielding dividend. However, its shares are not cheap. We think investors may want to wait for a pullback before initiating a position.Data by YChartsXcel delivered a poor Q2 2019, as the company saw its EPS declined to $0.46 per share. This was about 11.5% lower than a year ago. The decline was primarily due to adverse weather conditions. If we adjust weather-related sales, its adjusted electric sales actually increased by 0.4%.(Source: Q2 2019 Presentation)Looking forward, we have a positive view on Xcel for the following reasons:Five-year $20.1 billion capital projects will help drive revenue and earnings growthXcel has a five-year capital investment program of $20.1 billion. These investments are in the areas of electric distribution (26%), electric transmission (20%), renewables (18%), electric generation (15%), natural gas (12%), and other investments (9%). These projects should help grow its rate base by about 6.5% annually through 2023. As can be seen from the chart below, there may be additional investment opportunities (about $1 billion) available that will drive its rate base growth from the projected 6.5% growth annually to 7% growth annually. This should support its revenue growth in the next few years.(Source: June 2019 Investor Presentation)Xcel’s investments in renewable energy should be beneficialRecent legislations in Xcel’s markets, such as Colorado and New Mexico, appear to be favorable for the development of its renewable projects. Both states target to achieve 100% carbon-free status by 2050. These new legislations should help support its renewable projects. Besides favorable legislations, Xcel has a geographical advantage compared to many other utility companies to develop renewable energy. As can be seen from the left map below, Xcel’s markets have a rich wind resources compared to other states. Therefore, we expect above-average electricity generation in these states.(Source: June 2019 Investor Presentation)As can be seen from the table below, Xcel has a total of 2,950 MW of wind projects currently under construction. These projects should contributed to its revenue favorably in the next few years.(Source: June 2019 Investor Presentation)An investment grade balance sheetXcel has an investment grade balance sheet (see credit ratings for its debts below). It has a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 59%.(Source: Q2 2019 Earnings Release)Xcel also has a healthy leverage ratio of 4.7x. The company also has a clear financing plan for its projects in the next few years. As can be seen from the chart below, Xcel will finance its projects with $13 billion operating cash flow that it expects to generate in the next few years. There will also be incremental debts needed to fund its projects. We like the fact that equity issuance only represents a small portion of its total financing amount. This means the share dilution will be low.(Source: June 2019 Investor Presentation)Above average population growth rate in Xcel’s major marketsWe like the fact that population growth rates in many of Xcel’s major markets will exceed the national average. As can be seen from the map below, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Colorado, and Texas had a population growth rates between 0.5% and 2.0% in 2018. These growth rates should be above the national average of 0.6%. Only Michigan, Wisconsin, and New Mexico had population growth rates between 0% and 0.49% in 2018. If the trend continues in the next few years, we will expect steady growth in electricity consumption in Xcel’s markets.(Source: U.S. Census Bureau)Electricity consumption growth rate may increase due to the gradual adoption of electric vehiclesWhile electricity consumption has been stagnating in the past decade, we expect demand for electricity to resume growth in the next few decades due to the gradual adoption for electric vehicles. If electric vehicles completely replace all traditional vehicles, it will result in much higher electricity consumption than the current level. As can be seen from the chart below, the growth rate will be in the range of 10-55%.(Source: CityLab.com)As can be seen from the table below, in Xcel’s major markets, growth rates will range from 20% to 36%. In fact, Xcel estimates that electric vehicle sales will contribute to its revenue by about 0.4% annually from 2018 to 2035.(Source: Created by author; CityLab.com)Xcel is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 23.21x. This is about 1.7 multiple higher than the 21.5x average of its peers. We believe this is warranted given that all of its businesses are regulated utilities. In addition, the company's revenue growth is well-supported by its development projects in the next 5 years.Data by YChartsA growing 2.6%-yielding dividendXcel pays a quarterly dividend of $0.405 per share. This is equivalent to a dividend yield of about 2.6%. The company has consistently raised its dividend in the past. As can be seen from the chart below, the dividend yield of 2.6% is towards the low end of its 10-year yield range.Data by YChartsXcel faces several risks:(1) The company faces regulatory risk. A lengthy period of low interest rates could result in lower allowed return on equity.(2) Adverse weather may impact the demand for electricity.(3) Rising natural gas price can result in lower profit margin for its natural gas-fired power plants.We like Xcel’s regulated utilities business and its investment projects. We also have a positive long-term growth outlook for Xcel and think the company will continue to grow its dividend annually. Given that its shares have already surged by nearly 25% this year, we think a pullback will provide a more attractive risk/reward profile."
4168858,24206,2018-05-02T19:34:21-04:00,Revenue and operating income were flat; net income rose thanks to a lower tax bill.All of their base rate increases requests are in a holding pattern until the company recomputes their revenue needs by taking the TCJA into consideration.The second quarter doesn't look much brighter.,"Investment thesis: While Xcel energy is attractive due to its size and large geographic footprint, investors should consider other utilities that have better revenue growth with a higher dividend.Of 53 electric companies, Xcel Energy (XEL):Xcel provides electricity and gas service in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin. A broad geographic footprint is good because it broadens its exposure to various markets. However, it does mean it has to deal with a larger number of energy markets:(Image is from FERC)This potentially increases the company's compliance costs.The electric utility sector is down for the year:(chart from Finviz.com)The industry sold off in mid-December as Treasury yields started to rise. The industry continued to sell off in February with the broader market. Since then, the industry has been moving higher. As of this writing, the XLU is the best-performing ETF of the week:(Data from finviz.com)XEL's chart is in a solid uptrend:Prices sold off with the broader market starting in mid-December. Prices hit a hard bottom in early February and have been moving higher since. Prices are now above the 200-day EMA. The shorter EMAs are rising; prices are using them for technical support. The MACD (top panel) shows rising momentum, which supports a bullish case for the stock.Here are XEL's main developments over the last quarter (data from their latest 10-Q):Let's turn to the numbers from the 10-Q (please see this link for the source for all data going forward). First up, is the simple quarter on quarter comparison:Total revenue and operating income were up marginally. But the increase could just as well be classified as statistical noise. Net income increased due to a lower tax bill.The following table breaks the data down into operating segments:For all practical purposes, the numbers barely moved; any increase or decrease is analytically meaningless. We see the exact same result in the per-share earnings results for the various operating segments:Across the board, we see modest increases and decreases. There was no significant movement in either direction.The reason for earnings standing still is weak weather-normalized sales growth:The above table shows ""weather-normalized"" sales, where the company attempts to remove the weather impact from the numbers. It's very similar to an economist performing a seasonal adjustment. The numbers really aren't that surprising; large utilities have been coping with lower overall demand for the duration of this expansion. As a result, industrial production for utilities has been flat:(data from the Federal Reserve)What can we expect in the next quarterly report? As I recently noted, probably more of the same with a potential for modestly higher earnings:How does this fit with the rest of the utility industry? Overall, Eastern utilities (those that are east of the Mississippi River) have had a more difficult time growing revenue, instead relying on increasing margins to send more money to net income. In contrast, utilities in the NW have seen better top-line revenue growth and, in some cases, improved margins. The current quarter's earnings place XEL squarely in the middle of standard, east-of-the-Mississippi River utilities: it is difficult for them to grow revenue. Xcel is facing the same problem as many utilities: increased energy efficiencies are lowering or stagnating overall demand. That makes the selection process for utility candidates that much more important. While Xcel's size (it is the 7th largest electric utility by market capitalization) and 3.25% dividend might be attractive, there are other utilities that have either higher dividend yields or better revenue growth for investors to consider.

4138338,21558,2018-01-18T09:59:27-05:00,"Recent pricing trends in utility scale wind and solar, are presenting big opportunities for the utility sector.Power Purchase Agreements for both wind and solar are now below $20 a megawatt hour (mwh), making wind and solar cheaper then coal, nuclear, or natural gas generation.The move towards a 90+% renewable grid is now becoming a tangible goal, and the utilities that enable this to happen will be rewarded.Duke Energy and Xcel energy are well positioned to take advantage of this new energy economy.The combination of strong net margins, and the guaranteed profit model, make also make owning a utility a solid long term investment.","Over the past few months, the 10 year bond yield has risen substantially:This rise in the risk free yield, has investors moving away from the utility sector as the 10 year yield approaches the dividend yield of utilities. Here is the 3 month chart for Duke Energy (DUK):This recent decline in the utility sector is a buying opportunity for longer term investors. Based on fundamentals such as margins, margin growth, earnings, cash flow yields, dividends I have screened out the top utilities to own in 2018.My main metric is the net profit margins/trends. I am looking for the net margin above 10%, and trending upward over the past 3 years.Many utilities make this screening - so which ones are the best long term investments? This article will explore another key factor in a utilities long term success and profitability - Embracing renewables and the new energy economy.I am looking for a long term investment, so I do not want to worry about future compliance risk - and the substantial potential cost, of using coal to generate electricity.As we will explore in this article, Duke Energy and XCEL Energy (XEL) are my favorite picks in the utility sector based on fundamentals, and their leadership positions in renewable energy. First some profitability trends:Based on the higher margins and dividends, Duke Energy is my #1 pick.Both Duke Energy and XCEL Energy are positioning themselves to benefit from increased renewable penetrations, especially wind. The recent trends in utility scale wind and solar are quite amazing. Here are some recent (Fall of 2017) bids for wind and solar projects in North America:Austin Energy announced this December 2017, that it has accepted a record low US bid for a solar power purchase agreement. Estimates put this bid as low as 2.1 cents per kwh fixed for 15 years.Also, the results of Mexico's most recent energy auction were release on November 22, with 16 different bids with an average PPA price of 2 cents per kwh.Canadian solar (CSIQ) was awarded 370 mw's, and Enel Group a new record low wind PPA at 1.77 cents per kwh. Also of note, Global solar developer Neoen secured the lowest solar bid, at $19.18 per megawatt-hour -- which represents the lowest solar price seen in Latin America to date.Last month Xcel energy released their RFP responses:WOW - that was my first response. 96 bids for wind, with the median bid of $18 a mwh - totaling over 42 gigawatts. Using 1 standard deviation from the mean, the lower bids may be around $15 or 16 a mwh.Wind plus storage bids with a median bid of $21 a mwh. Based on the above recent results it is obvious that the cost of renewables are cheaper than coal or natural gas generation.In consumer terms, the cost per kilowatt hours (kwh) is now below 2 cents. The average USA residential rate is around 13 cents per kwh for comparison.To compare these recent low PPA's with 2017 generation costs for a utility, I performed a case study on an electric coop in Colorado - the Platte River Power Authority (PRPA).PRPA is an electric coop that serves 4 cities in Colorado: Fort Collins, Longmont, Loveland, and Estes Park. As a public entity, PRPA provides its load and cost data to the public. Here are some recent load, generation, and cost data points:Over the past year, the communities that PRPA serves have called for more renewables and less coal fired generation. This trend is not just municipalities, but large corporations (with large electrical loads) as well.As seen in the above data, PRPA is 96% coal generation (Craig and Rawhide) to municipal load in 2017. PRPA buys federal hydro power (LAP in graph) at about $30 a mwh, but has grid sales above that amount and sell for under $23 a mwh:From the above graphic, it appears the blended cost from PRPA's 3 coal units is about $27 or $28 a mwh. Of note is that PRPA has a direct rail line delivery of coal from the powder river basin in Wyoming, the cheapest coal basin in the USA. This provides an important data point for all utilities that typically do not share coal generation cost data.Using these new data points for PPA pricing, I have run grid simulations for PRPA using the most recent 12 months of hourly load data (8760 model). I loaded the 2017 8760 hours of PRPA loads into Homer energy software. Homer energy is an economic grid and micro-grid modeling software platform.My simulations included wind, solar, natural gas generation, small storage, grid purchases and sales. My simulation assumes no coal generation. Over 200,000 simulations were performed, and thousands of them has the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) under 2.5 cents per kwh. The way to look at these homer results are ""what if"" scenario analytics.My goal was to get PRPA close to 90% renewables by 2025. I have done this kind of modeling for many other grid simulations, and full isolated diesel micro-grids. Like my prior work, getting to 80-90% renewable penetration is economically possible, with that last 10% more costly. That is why I focus on the ""90%"" renewable grid.ESP llcSince PRPA can buy and sell energy to the larger grid, Homer would not include storage in the results. My assumption for solar is for an on-site solar array at PRPA's existing coal and natural gas plants, and for wind projects in Wyoming area. I used PPA cost of about $24.5 a mwh for both to include some estimate for integration costs. Also of note would be the solar project developer would use PRPA's land, eliminating land acquisition costs - this could mean even lower PPA pricing.As with other renewable simulations, Homer will pick results with over production of both solar and wind since PRPA could sell this excess energy at a small profit, further lowering the LCOE. Some simulation results came in at under 2 cents per kwh.The below results where for solar, wind, Li-ion storage and grid sales and purchases:ESP llcESP llcWe can see from the Homer Energy modeling, that we can have a future state of more than 80 or 90% renewables, that has a lower LCOE of the current cost of coal and gas generation.Another important factor is the capacity factors for wind and solar. For our Colorado example, wind and solar combined can achieve over 60-65% capacity factors.Wind can be over 45%, and utility scale solar at 25%. Wind and solar work well together, as it is more windy in the winter and shoulder seasons, and more windy at night, were as solar produces more in the summer and daytime.2 utilities that have announced plans to change their generation mix away from coal, and towards renewables are XCEL Energy . and Duke Energy .The Minneapolis-based utility, which serves eight Midwestern and Western states, is one of America's leading wind pioneers. In Colorado, the company is considering plans to shutter coal plants to make way for wind and other renewable resources.Xcel plans to add more than 3 gigawatts of wind power across its service area in the coming years and expects to generate the majority of its electricity from wind by 2021.XCEL has done similar modeling as I have, and come up with the same results. Close down more expensive generation - coal, and replace with cheaper, cleaner generation - wind.Getting all this new wind power will require new transmission, and infrastructure upgrades. This is why wind is good for a utilities revenues and profits, as they can charge the cost plus % for these new assets.Duke now owns and operates about 2,900 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy:Duke Energy Carolinas has continued its aggressive push for more renewable energy with an RFP for up to 500 MW of new wind capacity.The company is open to power purchase agreements as well as new or existing facilities that would be eventually purchased by Duke. Projects should be connected to the grid by the end of 2022.The CEO of Duke Energy says despite the Trump administration's push for fossil fuels, ""our strategy will continue to be to drive carbon out of our business."" (Charlotte Business Journal).As shown above, the cost of wind and solar are now cheaper then coal generation. This is not the only reason why some utilities are moving away from coal. Another important reason is the future compliance risk involved in using coal to generate electricity:GREENVILLE, N.C. -- Duke Energy pleaded guilty Thursday to nine violations of the federal Clean Water Act and will pay $102 million in fines and restitution for illegally discharging pollution from coal-ash dumps at five North Carolina power plants.All utilities that burn coal have a fly ash problem. Most simply store this hazardous waste on site with liners. Utilities develop generation resource plans decades out into the future, so many are now concerned about future legislation on not only fly ash, but the airborne pollutants as well.We can see from the above chart, the utility sector has taken a bit of a beating recently. As shown, many electric utilities have fallen 15-25% in just the past 6 months. The main reason for this is the expected rise in interest rates, and the 10 year bond yield. As the risk free rate approached the utilities dividend rate, many investors will swap out to the this safer asset class.I consider this recent downtrend to be a buying opportunity. Based on the above analysis on net margins, and the move to renewables, valuation, I find Duke Energy and XCEL energy as buys.Here is a table of 3 utilities and some other key metrics:ESP llcMost investors understand the first 3 metrics, but I have added another metric - the utilities renewable penetration percentage. As shown in the above equity share price chart, all 3 of these utilities have fallen, but Black Hills Corp. (BKH) has fallen the most. Black Hills Energy has pushed back on increasing renewables, and has a very low renewable %.I feel investors also are picking utilities that are moving towards renewables and away from coal. Investors also are worried about future compliance risk such as:The lawsuit was filed by the attorneys general of Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont, which in late 2013 originally asked to have nine upwind states added to the ""Ozone Transport Region.""""Millions of New Yorkers are breathing unhealthy air as smog pollution continues to pour in from other states,"" said New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed the lawsuit dated Friday.Another factor may be large institutional investors may start to divest in firms that are involved with polluting fossil fuel operations:When choosing an electric utility to invest in, I want to own those utilities that are proactively moving away from future compliance costs, and have large institutional investors supporting the equity as well.Due to the recent pull back in utilities, I feel this is a good entry point in a few select utilities. Based on solid fundamentals, positive cash flows, solid dividends, and the move to more renewables, I pick Duke Energy and XCEL energy as winner in the sector.Also one utility to avoid is Black Hills Corp, due to high leverage and short position, and the lack of any plans to move to the new energy economy and renewables."
4181535,40101,2018-06-14T00:31:07-04:00,"In the summer of 2016, my investment club decided to invest in a utility company because they liked Coach Mike. I vowed such a decision-making process would never happen again.It wouldn't hurt to diversify our portfolio and add another utility. Fortunately, we've got a DGI model to follow now. We want ""GRAVY"".It's not about basketball anymore. But deciding to add Xcel Energy to our portfolio should be a slam dunk.","The last time my investment club invested in the Utility sector, the decision was made based on basketball - specifically, Coach Mike Krzyzewski of Duke. Ridiculous? Absolutely! Harmful? In the long run, probably not.The vote happened quickly in the last few minutes of a meeting - before I could derail it. It prompted a vow on my part that such hurried, uninformed decision-making would never happen again.In the summer of 2016, our Otter Tail (NASDAQ:OTTR) investment doubled. We decided to diversify geographically. Beyond considering locale, the club selected Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) because they liked Coach Mike.We're at a point where it wouldn't hurt to add another utility to our portfolio from a diversification standpoint. Basketball will not be a deciding factor this time.Since the summer of 2016, we've adopted a model for selecting DGI (dividend growth investing) stocks based on GRAVY - “GR”owth “A”bility, “V”aluation and “Y”ield. We strive to invest in healthy, fairly valued dividend payers with clear potential for dividend growth.Our filters and weighting and scoring system highlighted Black Hills (NYSE:BKH). The electric and gas utility has grown its dividend for 48 years and offers a yield nearing 3.4%. Geographically, it would have my club heading west.(Source: Black Hills 2018 AGA Financial Forum Presentation)One aspect of the Black Hills story immediately sparked interest - it's at a turning point. My investment club is drawn to turning points. The rest of 2018 and 2019 will be spent setting the utility up for greater growth.(Source: Black Hills 2018 AGA Financial Forum Presentation)Consistently playing devil's advocate, it was time to ask the challenging questions. For example, if 48 years of dividend growth is attractive, wouldn't the 62-year track record of Northwest Natural Gas Company (NYSE:NWN) be downright gorgeous? And Northwest Natural Gas serves customers on the mainland as far west as one can get in the Pacific Northwest. The yield is comparative at 3.26%. However, dividend growth has been stifled at just $0.01 annually since 2014.(Source: EEI U.S. Member Company Service Territories)Or, would the club be better served diversifying into a utility like Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) that spans from Michigan to Texas, covering the extremes of climate in the U.S.? Though the company's dividend growth track record pales at just 15 years, its yield is comparative at 3.57%. And probably because it hasn't been growing its dividend as long, its 5-year average growth rate tops 6%, greater than that of both Black Hills and Northwest Natural Gas Company.(Source: Xcel Energy West Coast Investor Meetings presentation, May 30-31, 2018)In my club, selecting a DGI candidate means considering several pertinent factors.(Source: Author-created from company data)Earnings in the utility segment typically increase when the company's regulated rates increase. Rate cases are utilized for overall cost increases or large projects. Rate cases require regulatory approval by state. Thus, rate base growth is a result of capital investment.(Source: Author-created from company data)Based on the factors featured in the tables above, Xcel Energy stands apart. But it's not just about size. Yes, it has the largest rate base of the three. But its capital plans for future infrastructure are proportionately greater compared to its rate base.(Source: Xcel Energy West Coast Investor Meetings presentation, May 30-31, 2018)With the potential of Xcel's growing rate base, it's natural to wonder if its customers' bills will go up, up, up. On one hand, residential customers are employing energy-efficient technology and lowering usage. But Xcel intends to do its fair share for customers. The utility is targeting that its customers' bills increase only at a rate that is “at or below inflation”. The first step to controlling the rate means maintaining its operations and maintenance budget at approximately $2.3 billion through 2022. Last year marked the third consecutive year that the company was able to lower its O&M expenses. In 2017, its operational and technology improvements resulted in full-year O&M expenses totaling less than the 2014 level.(Source: Xcel Energy West Coast Investor Meetings presentation, May 30-31, 2018)Additionally, Xcel's fuel costs are projected to decrease alongside its carbon emissions. From 2005 through 2017, the company reduced its carbon footprint by 35%. By 2030, the goal is to be 85% carbon-free by continuing the reduction of coal usage and adopting renewable energy sources - wind and solar. By 2021, Xcel projects it will have 3,050 MW of new owned wind capacity. Its Colorado Energy Plan, introduced in 2017, aims to retire two coal units producing 660 MW, add 700 MW each of solar and natural gas and up to 1,000 MW of wind. Xcel also proposes to add 1,250 MW of wind in New Mexico and Texas.(Source: Xcel Energy West Coast Investor Meetings presentation, May 30-31, 2018)Like all utilities, Xcel Energy is currently dealing with the impact of tax reform. The company expects it to be accretive to earnings over the next five years.Tax reform also benefits the utility company's customers. Incorporating the benefits of tax reform for customers requires state commission approvals.While tax reform presents a bit of a challenge currently, the challenge is temporary.Even ""moderated"" to $18.5 billion, Xcel's capital expenditure plans certainly signal that it will be aggressively building its future infrastructure. Besides the utility's goal to lead its industry's clean energy transition, the company also intends to be ready for potential demands coming in the next decade, such as electric vehicle adoption or battery storage.(Source: Xcel Energy West Coast Investor Meetings presentation, May 30-31, 2018)Black Hills may be at a turning point, and that may well entice my investment club. But it's hardly a measurable factor. The dividend growth track records of both Black Hills and Northwest Natural Gas Company are a source of pride and will very likely be protected by their Boards. This factor alone warrants consideration.It certainly does not compare, but Xcel Energy's track record of 15 years is respectable. As well, it dominates in enough of the categories my club has deemed important to warrant not only consideration but investment. It is healthy and fairly valued. There's clear potential for dividend growth. And speaking of immeasurable factors, though we don't live in its service territories, we should certainly value Xcel's goal of keeping its customers' bills low in spite of a growing rate base.It's not going to be about basketball this time.

Unit 2 produces 335 mg and was built in 1975.Unit 1 would be closed at the end of 2022, and Unit 2 by the end of 2025 under terms of the agreement that was negotiated by Xcel with the staff of the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, and other parties.The CPUC would still have to approve the plan, but it is expected that approval will be given.Unit 3, which Xcel says is a highly advanced, highly efficient, supercritical coal unit, would continue to operate under the proposal. Unit 3 was built in 2010 and is capable of generating 750 mw.All three units use low-sulfur coal from the Powder River Basin near Gillette, Wyoming.The Associated Press reports that the Comanche Generation Station burns around 5 million tons of coal a year. If the two older units are retired, that would be cut in half, Xcel spokesman Mark Stutz said. Xcel says that with the implementation of the agreement, the company's renewable energy share of its generation portfolio will grow to 55% by 2026. Companies listed as mining coal in the Powder River Basin include Alpha Natural Resources (OTCPK:ANRZQ), Arch Coal (ARCH), Black Hills Corporation (BKH), Cloud Peak Energy (CLD), Kiewit Royalty Trust (OTCPK:KIRY), Peabody Energy (BTU), Ambre Energy, and Westmoreland Coal Company (WLB).Not all of the companies listed above supply coal to the Comanche Station but the loss of this coal user increases concerns that companies operating in the Powder River Basin will need to look farther for customers, including overseas.If there is good news for coal companies out of this announcement, it is that (1) the announcement brings some certainty to an otherwise uncertain situation for the coal units, (2) the two units being mothballed will continue to require coal supplies for the next 5 to 8 years, (3) plans are for the larger Unit 3 to continue to operate after that time period, and (4) the export market continues to be robust. While the U.S. domestic market for coal appears to continue to shrink, coal companies are increasingly dependent on overseas markets for their sales.Coal exports for the first quarter of 2017 were 58% higher than in the same quarter last year, according to the Energy Information Administration. Steam coal exports have increased by 6 million short tons (MMst) and metallurgical coal exports have increased by 2 MMst. Most of these exports were shipped from Atlantic Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports.In EIA’s most recent Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), EIA expects growth in coal exports to slow in the coming months, with total 2017 exports forecast at 72 MMst, 11 MMst (19%) higher than the 2016 level.These levels still are above expected growth in the U.S. market, which is expected to continue to decline due to environmental concerns.For Peabody Energy, which already has assets in Australia, and for Arch Coal, which ships most of its coal out of the country already, the continued health of their foreign markets, particularly in Asia and Europe, becomes of paramount concern to investors.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4241487,40101,2019-02-15T12:20:33-05:00,"Xcel Energy reported fourth quarter and full-year results on January 31st. The utility is executing exactly as planned.The utility's 2019 outlook includes further expansion of its wind capacity, decreases in O&M expenses, EPS growth of 5% to 7% and dividend growth of 5% to 7%.Longer term, the company has plans through 2023 that will grow its rate base and decrease its carbon emissions footprint while controlling its customers' bills.Potential investors desiring a minimum 3% yield on cost can achieve this by acquiring XEL at a price below $53.33.","It's reassuring when a company executes exactly as planned.Xcel Energy (XEL) is an electric and natural gas utility operating in eight states - Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Colorado, Texas and New Mexico. The utility plans to be the first in the United States to totally eliminate its carbon emission footprint and plans to do so by 2050. Its transition to clean energy sources - wind, solar, natural gas and battery storage, is progressing so well the utility proposes to reach the 80% mark by 2030. From 2005 to year-end 2018, Xcel has already reduced its footprint by 39%.SourceIn the third quarter, Xcel Energy narrowed its full-year earnings guidance for 2018 to a range of $2.45 to $2.49. On January 31st, the utility reported fourth quarter and full-year results for 2018. It delivered GAAP diluted earnings of $2.47 per share, the exact midpoint of its latest projection. This was a 9.8% improvement over 2017, ahead of the company's long-term target for 5% to 7% earnings growth.The earnings improvement is encouraging because full-year revenue in 2018 improved just 1.2% to $11.54 billion compared to 2017 revenue. The primary contributor to the bottom line performance was the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act.Earnings for a utility company typically increase when the company's regulated rates increase. Rate cases require regulatory approval by state governments. Rate cases are utilized for overall cost increases or large projects. Thus, as a utility invests in its infrastructure, its rate base should grow.In less than a year, Xcel's capital investment forecast increased from $18.5 billion to $20.1 billion.SourceThe two latest contributors to the forecast are the acquisition of Mankato Energy Center, a natural gas plant in Minnesota and the PPA (power purchase agreement) buyout of a wind farm in Minnesota.On November 6th, Xcel Energy announced its acquisition of Mankato. Xcel's NSP (Northern States Power) subsidiary had a tolling agreement with the Mankato plant through Southern Power until July, 2026. Southern Power is a subsidiary of Southern Company (SO). Calpine Corporation sold the natural gas-fired plant with capacity of 375-MW to Southern Power in 2016. The center includes a second unit, still under construction, which will increase capacity to 760-MW of electricity.In December, Xcel's NSP (Northern States Power) subsidiary filed with the MPUC (Minnesota Public Utilities Commission) for the acquisition of the Jeffers and Community Wind North wind farms. The wind farms were owned by Longroad Energy. NSP will repower the wind farms. The repowering effort should be completed by December, 2020.But, state governments cannot unconditionally greenlight constantly increasing rates. Xcel's intention is its customers' bills will increase only at a rate “at or below inflation”. The first step to controlling the rate means maintaining an operations and maintenance budget at approximately $2.3 billion through 2022.From 2015 to 2017, Xcel was able to lower its O&M expenses. In fact, O&M expenses in 2017 were less than O&M expenses in 2014. But, the category increased slightly for all of 2018, rising from $2.27 billion to $2.35 billion.The company listed several culprits creating the difference such as additional maintenance related to atypical summer heat and increased costs for business processes and customer service. It also pointed out the wind generation it is adding is not replacing legacy generation yet. Thus, there are slight temporary costs for additional capacity.And yet, for 2019, Xcel is intent on resetting O&M expenses to the 2017 level of $2.27 billion.Xcel's long-term target of 5% to 7% annual earnings growth and 5% to 7% annual dividend growth remain in tact. These targets continue to be supported by the planned rate base growth to $36.8 billion by 2023.SourceBut, as noted above, this does not mean Xcel's customers bills will increase in line with earnings and dividend growth.SourceXcel currently serves 3.6 million electricity customers and 2 million natural gas customers with 17 gigawatts (GW) of capacity. Besides controlling the costs of operations, it will be key for the utility to lower the costs of fuel inputs.SourceFrom 2007 to 2017, Xcel retired 2.1 GW of coal capacity and replaced it with wind capacity of 6.7 GW. The utility intends to continue retiring its reliance on coal by 2.1 GW in the next ten years. SourceBy 2021, Xcel's wind capacity is expected to increase to 11.3 GW, 40% of which will be owned rather than purchased. SourceIn addition to the expansion opportunities, there is ample opportunity for Xcel to buy out more of its power purchasing agreements.SourceXcel expects its customers' demands to change and expand in the near future.SourceGrid modernization should provide more reliability, greater security and enable utilities to address outages more efficiently. As well, it should provide customers more options and the ability to take greater control of their usage as their homes become “smarter”.These features become more critical as the adoption of electric vehicles increases. By 2035, Xcel estimates there could be as many as 2 million electric vehicles in use in its territories. This will require additional distribution equipment to support public charging stations, home charging stations and fleet charging operations.According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the United States will add approximately 11 GW of electric generating capacity from wind in 2019. Xcel is scheduled to add over 10% or 1.23 GW of this projection.The utility's capital spending forecast for the year is now $5.17 billion which should bump the rate base above $30 billion.Earnings are projected in a range of $2.55 to $2.65 per share.The utility typically announces its dividend rate for the year in the latter part of February. Since 2014, the increase has equaled $0.02 quarterly or $0.08 annually. If Xcel follows suit, the rate will grow to $1.60 for 2019. This would equate to growth of 5.3% compared to the 2018 rate. At the midpoint of the expected earnings for the year, it equates to a payout of 62%, in line with the ratio of the past four years.Xcel Energy is indeed executing as planned. This includes execution on its near-term commitment to shareholder return inclusive of dividend growth at 5% to 7% per year.Anticipating an updated dividend rate of $1.60 per share for 2019 would mean potential investors looking for a yield on investment of 3% need to pull the trigger below $53.33."
4051868,100856,2017-03-03T11:50:52-05:00,"Xcel Energy recently released its Q4 report.It is a profitable utility with an excellent dividend record.Currently, it is trading 9% above fair value.","On February 2, Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) released their Q4 results, reporting EPS of $0.45 which beat estimates by $0.01, and revenue of $2.79 billion which missed estimates by $530 million. This mixed Q4 report makes one wonder whether or not Xcel Energy is worth considering as a long-term investment.Company OverviewXcel Energy is a utility holding company that is headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, has a workforce of approximately 12,000 employees, and a market capitalization of $22.07 billion.Through its four subsidiaries - Northern States Power-Minnesota, Northern States Power-Wisconsin, Public Service Company of Colorado, and Southwestern Public Service Co. - Xcel Energy serves 3.3 million electrical consumers and 1.8 million natural gas consumers in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin.Competitive AdvantageGenerally speaking, as investments utilities boast two main advantages. First, they possess a geographical monopoly over the territories which they serve, as it is expensive to build power plants (which limits the chances of prospective competitors doing so where an established provider exists) and it is costly to switch energy providers (which limits the chances of customers who have to power their homes from changing from one energy provider to another).The second main advantage that a utility has is government regulation. Utilities are regulated to ensure that customers are protected from price gouging, and the regulations that are brought to bear on the utilities involved make it cost-prohibitive for a competitor to attempt to offer an alternative service. Combined, these factors make utilities as stable an investment as it gets.Xcel Energy's ability to benefit from these advantages can be gleaned from its revenue and net income figures over the past five years:Further proof of Xcel Energy's profitability can be gleaned from the dividends it has rewarded shareholders with over the years: Xcel Energy has paid consecutively rising dividends since 2004 - a thirteen-year streak that only a profitable company can sustain.ValuationCurrently, Xcel Energy is trading in the mid-$40 range with a price-to-earnings ratio of 19.89, a forward P/E ratio of 17.93 and offers a dividend yield of 3.28% with a sustainable payout ratio of 60.70%. Both the trailing and forward P/E ratios are higher than Xcel Energy's five-year average P/E ratio of 16.7, and its current dividend yield is lower than its five-year average dividend yield of 3.61%. This suggests that Xcel Energy is somewhat overvalued at this time, as does the fact that it is trading just 1.84% shy of its 52-week high.So what is fair value for Xcel Energy? Well, earnings per share over the last twelve months was $2.21, and EPS growth for the next five years is estimated to be 5.32%, leveling off to 5.20% thereafter. Using an 11% discount rate - the stock market average - I calculate fair value for Xcel Energy to be $40.29. The stock is thus currently overvalued by 9%.Final ThoughtsThat Xcel Energy is an excellent company which has served its investors well cannot be doubted, and it is definitely a hold at this time. However, prospective investors who are seeking to initiate a position here would be wise to wait until the share price pulls back closer to fair value before doing so, as it is hard to recommend a stock that is trading 9% above fair value - especially an established utility stock which is not likely to supply huge growth rates for its investors going forward.DISCLAIMER: The author is not a financial professional and accept no responsibility for any investment decisions a reader makes.

4039911,102327,2017-01-26T17:52:01-05:00,"XEL is a growing utility that is growing it dividend too.XEL is growing its wind and solar generation capabilities in a reasonable way.With growing earnings and growing dividends, XEL is priced at a good value.","Xcel Energy (NYSE:XEL) is a utility company with operations in eight states spread across the middle of the country. For dividend growth investors looking to own a company that is growing its investments in renewable energy generation, the market price of the stock is currently below the present value of the dividend stream, making it a buy.Is XEL a good investment partner?In evaluating a new company, I use a checklist to determine whether a company is a good investment partner. The four items on my checklist are: growing markets, growing profits, responsible handling of debt and growing dividends. I want the company being evaluated to present me with the data I need to make that determination, and for XEL I find it in this presentation. Read the whole presentation, but below I provide the slides that best address the items in my checklist.This first slide provides a view of the service territories for each of the 4 XEL subsidiaries and how much each subsidiary contributes to the total earnings. I like that XEL is entirely composed of regulated utility businesses. Sure, being regulated caps the potential profits, but it also guarantees a profit as well. I have seen many utilities that are now in the process of selling their unregulated segments because they didn't live up to expectations.This slide coupled with the previous slide, showing service territories, shows a couple of things. First it shows that XEL while wanting to increase its generation capabilities in wind and solar power, also recognizes that not all areas are suitable for those generation technologies. Second, when potential is compared to customer location, XEL is matching capacity to both generation potential and customers. Notice, for instance, where the customers are located for NPSM. Those customers are well located to get power from wind but not so well located to get power from solar generation. And XEL is aligning its investments in developing capacity to match that. For a utility that generates its own power, locating new sources of power where they are cost effective to service customers is a key to good pricing and maintaining (or even growing) market share.Regulated utilities need to maintain good relations with the agencies that regulate them. The slide above shows that XEL has a plan in place to work with its various regulatory agencies. I am somewhat concerned that NSPW doesn't yet implement many of the parts of this plan, but since at most it represents 10% of earnings, it's not a big concern yet. NSPM and PSCo, since they represent the lion's share of earnings, are far more important in how far along they are in implementing this plan. I will want to monitor XEL progress on getting the remainder of these items fully implemented across all subsidiaries and states.A company cannot pay a growing dividend for long unless it has growing earnings. The slide above shows the history of XEL's dividend payments since 2005. I think that a history of growing earnings in the past is a good indicator for the future. Its not a perfect indicator, which is why I need more than this single slide to support a finding that XEL will continue to grow earnings into the future. I also like that XEL provides projections for EPS in both 2016 (which was mostly complete when this presentation was given) and 2017. I also like that the projected growth target range going forward is just a bit lower than what they grew in the past. Given that the EPS has nearly doubled since 2005, it's a lot harder to grow more than 6% going forward than it was in the past.Since a large component of both revenue and earnings for utilities comes from the rate base, I like to see guidance on rate base growth. Since XEL is entirely composed of regulated utilities, these numbers are easier to project. I like that the projections of the increase in the rate base are a bit higher than the middle of their EPS growth target. If they hit these targets, the EPS targets are very likely to be met.The next item on my checklist has to do with managing the debt well. The slide above shows, using several different metrics, that XEL is doing a good job. The various ratios of debt versus some measure of cash flow or equity show that XEL should be able to support its debt payments and that those payments will not have a bigger impact on profits than they currently do. The credit ratings also show that the credit rating agencies think XEL has its debt well in hand. Also with investment grade credit, it will be able to finance new debt at reasonable rates.From the slide above it looks like debt maturities are reasonable. I am a little concerned with the large amount in 2018, but with so low an amount needed in 2017 XEL should have enough time to handle it all. Given that interest rates will likely increase, refinancing some of the 2018 debt early could work to XEL's benefit.Finally, managing debt responsibly also entails spending your capital wisely. The slide above shows how XEL is spending its capital budget. Despite wanting to be bigger players in wind and solar generation, I like that they are only spending just under 20% of their capital budget between now and 20121 on renewables. I also like that they are devoting the majority of their spending to electricity, which is what XEL provides the majority of its customers.This last slide shows that XEL management recognizes that dividend growth is important to its investors. I like that it shows both the total dividend and the portion that was an increase from the prior year. One thing that does sometimes happen with dividend paying companies, is that as time goes along they slow their dividend growth, so the CAGR for longer periods will be higher than for shorter more recent periods. I like that XEL has over the last 3 years grown its dividend at a faster rate than the rate it grew since 2005. Finally, I like that management has included both a target payout ratio and a target dividend growth rate. That makes it easier for me to figure out a rate to use in my DDM calculation.Looking at the CCC List, I can see that XCEL has paid a growing dividend for 13 years, which backs up the data the company presented. 13 years also exceeds my desired streak length of 10 years.What's a good price?To figure out a good price, I do a DDM calculation using my Excel® based DDM calculator (pictured above, you can see the web-based calculator I based it on here and read a discussion on how the formulas were developed here).For XEL, I used their current dividend of $1.36 and the low end of management's dividend growth target range. The terminal dividend growth rate is set to 3%, which is what I use for utilities (as they should be able to grow the earnings and thus the dividends around the rate of inflation). I also use 6.4% as I want my dividend income to increase at twice the rate of long time inflation. That produces a present value of $45.10 for the predicted dividend payments. I think price under $45 is thus a buy. So with the current market price being under $41, XEL is a buy at this time.Can options help?At the present time I don't see any attractive calls at strike prices I am willing to sell ($45 and above).For a cash secured put, for the February expiration date, both the $40 and $45 strikes offer potentially attractive premiums. Because the bid/ask spread is so wide, don't try to use market orders, only use a limit order. Depending on your commission structure, getting about $0.45 premium for just a little more than 20 days might be workable. The slightly less than 1 in 3 chance of getting the shares assigned, isn't ideal, but the premium could be worth it if you commission is small enough.Information from Simply Wall St websiteI recently heard about a website called Simple Wall St. which provides a lot of information on various publicly traded companies and their stocks. They get their data from S&P Capital HQ. The site has a free membership level and a premium paid level. I found it very helpful in how it displayed data.Here you can find their analysis of XEL.Above is the summary of their analysis of XEL. Basic information is included. Two things of particular note is what they call the snowflake and the list of competitors (with their snowflakes as well).The snowflake gives an over-all summary of what the data shows about dividends, value, future prospects, past performance and general financial health of the company. The farther out from the center the colored area is, the better the company did on that measure. The color of the snowflake also gives a summary reading on the company. Green is good, the redder the color the less well the company is doing. I also like that you get a snap shot of the evaluation of several competitors.For XEL, since I am most interested in the dividend, I like seeing that the dividend parameter is near its maximum value.This shows the value metric that I find applicable to what I am looking for in a company. I don't place a lot of value in P/E ratios, but it does tend to indicate reasonable valuation if the company is trading at a better ratio than its industry. XEL is selling for a lower P/E than the average for utilities.This slide presents what analysts expect for earnings growth and compares it with a benchmark of a low risk date plus inflation. I want earnings to increase faster than inflation, and clearly this graphic shows that analysts expect that to happen over the near to mid-term. Such growing earnings are good, because they will allow XEL to increase the dividends faster than inflation as well. I also like this graphic because it shows that analysts reach a conclusion on earnings growth that is fairly close to what management says is there goal. This gives me greater assurance that management will be able to meet their targets.This slide shows in part why XEL didn't do as well as it might on the future performance aspect of the analysis. While the benchmark for one test was 20% ROE and XEL won't have that in 3 years, it still did better than the average utility and is expected to improve on this metric over the next 3 years. For me, I am not so concerned with a utility having a very high ROE, as utilities have regulatory requirements that both limit the maximum and minimum value for that metric, but see that it beats the average for utilities as far more important.I like the Simply Wall St site because it presents the data in a very easy-to-understand format. Visualizing the meaning of the data from S&P Capital IQ, which is very reliable data source, is a valuable addition when analyzing a company's performance.ConclusionXEL looks like an interesting utility. I think it's well-positioned to carry out its plans to increase the amount of power it generates from wind and solar. If an investor is looking to add a company that is adding renewable sources of power, XEL is priced at a good value and worth consideration.Note: I hope you all got something out of this article.

4055327,63883,2017-03-15T08:23:10-04:00,,"This post was written by Bob Ciura for Sure DividendIncome investors should consider adding some U.S. utility stocks to their portfolios.Utilities are extremely stable. Electricity and gas are defensive industries. They see continuous demand, even during recessions. This allows them to be consistent dividend payers over long periods of time.Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) and Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) are both Dividend Achievers - a group of 271 stocks with 10+ years of consecutive dividend increases. You can see the full Dividend Achievers list here.Duke has paid dividend for more than 90 years. Xcel, going back to its days as Northern States Power, has paid dividends for over six decades.Duke and Xcel are very similar companies. They both provide electric and natural gas services, mostly in regulated markets.This article will discuss which of these two U.S. utility giants, could be the better dividend stock to buy today.Business OverviewWinner: XcelXcel Energy is a fully regulated utility. It has operations in eight U.S. states, mostly in the West and Midwest.Its customer base includes 3.5 million electricity customers and 2.0 million natural gas customers.(Source: March 2017 Morgan Stanley Conference, page 20)Approximately 90% of Xcel's earnings come from electricity, with the remaining 10% from gas.Duke is also an electric and gas utility. It has a large regulated utility business that has approximately 7.4 million electric customers. Duke Energy's customers are located in six states in the Southeast and Midwest.It also distributes natural gas to more than 1.5 million customers in the Carolinas, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee.(Source: 4Q Earnings Presentation, page 4)The company's electric utility business comprises nearly 90% of its total earnings.Duke's adjusted earnings per share rose 3.3% in 2016. Growth was driven by favorable weather conditions, cost controls and acquisition-related synergies.Meanwhile, Xcel's adjusted earnings per share grew 5.7% last year. Like Duke, it also benefited from favorable weather. The company had the added advantage of stronger rate increases.Both Xcel and Duke have a 'A-' credit rating from Standard & Poor's. They both have strong business businesses, built around regulated markets.But due to its more favorable rate outcomes and slightly stronger financial performance last year, Xcel gets the nod.Growth ProspectsWinner: Toss-UpDuke and Xcel have virtually identical growth strategies.In both cases, their three biggest growth initiatives going forward are shifting to regulated operations, investing in renewables and expanding in natural gas. And both companies expect long-term earnings growth of 4-6% each year.Regulated markets are typically more stable than unregulated markets, because they allow utilities to generate regular rate hike approvals.Xcel is restructuring its financial framework around regulated businesses.(Source: March 2017 Morgan Stanley Conference, page 13)Duke Energy is following suit. It has made $25 billion of infrastructure investments over the past 10 years, centered on regulated markets.(Source: 4Q Earnings Presentation, page 9)Separately, the company pushed further into regulated markets in 2012, when it merged with Progress Energy in a massive $32 billion deal. In addition, Duke exited its international business to focus more on domestic regulated businesses.As a result of these moves, Duke will generate nearly 100% of future profit from its regulated business.And both companies are investing in renewable energy sources. By 2021, more than one-third of Xcel's energy will be generated from renewable sources, like wind and solar.(Source: March 2017 Morgan Stanley Conference, page 7)Xcel expects to invest $18.4 billion in capital expenditures from 2017 to 2021, 19% of which will be allocated toward renewable energy. This is expected to fuel 5.5% compound annual growth in the company's rate base.(Source: March 2017 Morgan Stanley Conference, page 10)By 2021, approximately 10% of its rate base will come from renewables, up from 4% in 2016. Renewable energy is expected to contribute the highest growth for Xcel moving forward.By 2026, Duke will derive 9% of its energy from hydroelectricity, wind and solar, up from 2% in 2005.Lastly, Xcel's natural gas earnings rose 4% last year.Duke Energy has boosted its own natural gas business, largely through acquisitions. In 2015, it acquired Piedmont Natural Gas for $4.9 billion. The acquisition tripled Duke's natural gas customers, by adding 1 million natural gas customers to its existing customer base of 525,000.Going forward, the company expects to generate steady growth from these initiatives.(Source: 4Q Earnings Presentation, page 14)The regulated and natural gas businesses are expected to grow by 6% per year through 2021. This is projected to fuel 4-6% growth in adjusted earnings per share over that time.DividendsWinner: Duke EnergyDuke pays an annualized dividend of $3.42 per share. This works out to a 4.2% dividend yield based on its recent share price.For its part, Xcel has a 3.3% dividend yield.Both stocks yield significantly more than the average stock. The S&P 500 Index as an average dividend yield of 2%.But Duke has a big advantage. The stock generates roughly 27% more annual income for investors than Xcel.Part of the reason for this is that Duke maintains a higher payout ratio. Xcel distributed 62% of its earnings per share over the past 12 months, compared with a 73% payout ratio for Duke.The trade-off is that Xcel typically raises its dividend at a higher rate than Duke. Xcel raised its dividend by 5.9% in February 2017. Duke's last dividend raise was a 3.6% hike last year.Xcel expects to increase its dividend by 5-7% per year.Duke intends to maintain a 70-75% payout ratio going forward. It expects to increase its dividend by 4% per year moving forward.If Xcel raises its dividend by 6%, compared with 4% for Duke, it will take 15 years for Xcel's yield on cost to surpass Duke Energy's. As a result, while Xcel could be a better choice for investors with a very long time horizon, Duke is the better pick for income now.Final ThoughtsDuke and Xcel have extremely similar business models and future growth strategies. Both companies are high-quality utilities.It would be fairly easy to argue that both stocks deserve a place in an income investor's stock portfolio. They have both paid consistent dividends for decades, without interruption.That being said, they have different dividend policies. Duke is willing to part with more of its cash flow each year than Xcel. Its higher payout ratio means investors receive a much higher dividend yield, which makes a big difference for dividend investors.As a result, Duke is the better utility dividend stock."

XEL services 3.5 million electric customers and 2.0 million natural gas customers in eight states. Xcel Energy has embarked on an aggressive capital expansion program that is one of the largest in the sector. Management expects to spend an average of $3 billion annually over the next five years, driving its regulated rate base higher. However, Xcel currently offers little exceptional investment value based on its share price and yield, regulator lag creating lower ROE, and a history of mediocre returns on invested capital.90% of XEL's earnings come from electric regulated businesses and 10% from regulated natural gas. Its utilities are:• Northern States Power, which serves customers in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Michigan;• Public Service Company of Colorado; and• Southwestern Public Service Company, which serves customers in Texas and New Mexico.Management offers future guidance including an average EPS growth rate of 4% to 6%, dividend growth of 5% to 7%, and a payout ratio of 60% to 70%. In 2015, the payout ratio was 65%, about mid-range of management's future guidance. For dividend growth to outstrip earnings growth, the payout ratio will climb to the upper end of the guidance range.As with many utilities, XEL's future growth is based on an expanding rate base. Over the next five years, Xcel is expecting to invest $15.2 billion. 27% of cap ex is earmarked for transmission projects, 27% for electric distribution upgrades and expansion, 22% for new generation capacity, and 13% for its natural gas infrastructure. This expansion will be funded mainly by operating cash flow. In 2015, the company generated $3.0 billion in operating cash flow, with its projections of $13.3 billion in OCF during 2016 to 2020. This relates to an average annual OCF projection of $2.66 billion, slightly less than in 2015, but in line with 2013 and 2014. The balance of cap ex will be funded by the issuance of $1.9 billion in new debt, with no new issuance of stock expected. Unlike some of its peers, management has done an admirable job of maintaining share count over time, raising an average of just 1.6% a year over the previous 10 years while investing over $25 billion. Long-term debt has grown over the same period from $6.6 billion to $12.5 billion.The geographic areas served leans heavily towards MN and CO, and combined these states comprise around 75% of earnings. While Colorado is considered as regulatory friendly for utilities under their jurisdiction, Minnesota is considered as average.Historically, Xcel relied on coal for over 50% of its fuel source. However, the company made a commitment to wind generation 10 years ago, and is replacing its base load coal with intermittent load wind. Natural gas and nuclear remain about the same percentage of total exposure by fuel. Below is a graphic from its most recent investor presentation outlining the transformation of XEL's fuel supply from 2005 to 2030.XEL's management has made a commitment to renewable power generation, with natural gas generation used as a backstop. Below are EIA maps of preferred locations for wind and solar power generation in North America.The company's service territory falls in the sweet spot for wind generation and is a strong contender for solar generation in its western service area. The management has developed the approach of investing in utility-scale wind projects where the assets can be incorporated into its regulated rate base, and the company is the recipient of tax credits and subsidies. Of the four utility-scale wind farms XEL operates, three are company owned and the balance is purchased using long-term purchase power agreements (PPAs).According to the company, XEL is the #1 utility wind power provider in the US for the past 11 years. As of the end of 2015, Xcel owned 5,800 MW of wind generation, or a total of 7.7% of the total US wind generating capacity. Management plans on expanding its wind generating base by a minimum of 40% over the next few years, with this year's goal of over 7,000 MW. Below is a chart of installed wind capacity from 2006 to 2016:XEL is also expanding its solar footprint. However, the company prefers utility-scale projects over distributed rooftop and small community or neighborhood sites. Regulators in MN recently approved three large solar projects, with a 100 MW site as the anchor. In Colorado, XEL is under contract for 100 MW from three sites as well.Of interest are management's pilot projects in Colorado using large batteries as solar-generated storage. One project is in partnership with a community solar site. The more important project is a combination of utility-scale solar generation with battery storage to supply a new microgrid at the Denver airport as emergency backup. This site will also feed to the regional grid. The combination of solar with storage integrating a microgrid could be a fascinating development for the company. The foresight to profit from the increasing demands for microgrids could provide XEL with interesting opportunities.While the future looks interesting for XEL's power generation, management's return on equity (ROE) has been lacking. The management has been plagued with low returns in part due to ""regulatory lag"". The lag is the time delay between an actual cash payment or investment by the utility and its inclusion into the regulated rate base. In the case of Xcel, returns have been less than the allowed rate in several of its businesses. Below is a table of allowed vs. weighted average earned ROE for 2015, per the company's presentation. In addition is a graphic showing the overall ROE by the operating company. Xcel generated an overall ROE of 8.91% for 2015.Source: Investors Presentation, Guiding Mast InvestmentsIn Minnesota, Xcel's electric business generated an ROE of 8.4% vs. an allowed rate of 9.7%. Based on its regulated rate base of $7.074 billion, the difference between allowed and actual ROE amounts to $91 million in profits annually. In Colorado, the difference for XEL's gas business is $35 million. According to Fitch, XEL is not alone in its struggle for earn its allowed ROE. On average in 2015, utilities earned 82 basis points less than their allowed ROE, again blamed mainly on regulatory lag.According to the company, a 25 basis point improvement in ROE would equate to a gain in EPS of $0.06 and a 50 basis point improvement would generate a $0.12 improvement. The common cure for regulatory lag is more frequent rate requests, greater use of periodical cost adjustments, and specific project investment inclusions in the rate base. Regulators in Minnesota recently implemented a series of rate reforms incorporating some of these cures. While it may take a few years for the full impact to be felt on XEL's ROE, it is a positive step in the right direction.In 2014, Xcel formed two transmission subsidiaries, Xcel Energy Transmission Development Co. and Xcel Energy Southwest Transmission Development Co. Xcel is the sixth largest transmission company, based on network miles. As shown in the graphic above, these subsidiaries earned a 10.22% ROE in 2015 and are a bright spot for the company. Of the capital investment program outlined above, over $4.1 billion is expected to be invested in transmission network expansion.Xcel's management has an interesting opportunity concerning its transmission assets. Federally-regulated transmission businesses usually offer improved ROE over state-regulated assets, and XEL is no exception as demonstrated in the graphic above. This advantage is not going unnoticed as the only stand-alone US transmission company recently received a merger proposal from a Canadian utility. Based on an offer of $6.9 billion for its equity and assumption of $4.4 billion in debt for 15,500 miles of transmission assets, XEL's 20,000 miles of assets in about the same geography could be worth upwards of $14.6 billion, or 42% of its enterprise value of $34.6 billion ($20.6 billion market cap, $13.0 billion debt). However, Xcel's transmission business and its wind generation position are the crown jewels of the company.XEL's market valuation seems to be expensive, relative to its forecasts. Below are two fastgraph.com charts that tell the tale of overvaluation of share price and average performance on ROIC:With a WACC of 3.69%, 2015 net ROIC is positive, unlike many of its peers. However, the management has offered 2016 EPS guidance of $2.12 to $2.27, for a forward PE ratio of 18.72. The sector is trading at a forward PE average of around 15.5. In addition, a current yield of 3.41% is about average for an electric utility.While taking profits is not necessarily recommended for current investors, there are better opportunities elsewhere in the sector. The management has struggled with earning allowed ROE, and even though there is some movement for an improving environment, full implementation will be a few years away. Investors looking to add exposure to wind power generation and transmission assets may want to review XEL, but buying on dips is suggested.Author's note: Please review disclosure in Author's profile."
4104414,103473,2017-09-06T09:58:13-04:00,"The U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s new energy storage study identifies electric utilities with high demand charges that represent attractive energy storage markets.Arizona, Colorado, Minnesota, North Carolina, and Georgia are among the states with non-restructured utilities and high demand charges.Given the experience in Nevada, where large commercial customers defected from the incumbent utility service, investors should ask which utilities are most vulnerable.This article uses data on the largest state employers, state commercial electricity rates and revenue, and utility business models to rank grid defection risk by state and company.Among the four companies evaluated, Pinnacle West has the highest earnings risk, followed by Duke Energy.","Recently, the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory published a short study about the potential energy storage market for U.S. commercial electricity customers, “Identifying Potential Markets for Behind-the-Meter Battery Energy Storage: A Survey of U.S. Demand Charges.” The paper's authors examined over 10,000 commercial utility tariffs across the U.S. to identify those with the highest demand charges. Demand charges, defined as a fee per kilowatt “based on the highest level of electricity supplied at one time during the billing period and at the time of day it’s needed.” This is in contrast to energy charges, which is the cost for every kilowatt-hour consumed by a customer. As the NREL study notes, customers with high demand charges benefit from managing their load to reduce their peak usage. Energy storage is an option for doing so.Number of commercial electricity customers that can subscribe to demand charges over $15/kWSource: National Renewable Energy Laboratory, 2017The NREL report focuses on markets for energy storage, but in the long-term, customers who opt for energy storage may be tempted to take the next logical step, completely separating from the grid. This scenario could be devastating for regulated utilities, which would face higher fixed costs spread over fewer remaining customers. The scenario was first elaborated in detail by the power industry’s Edison Electric Institute. EEI’s 2013 report, ""Disruptive Challenges: Financial Implications and Strategic Responses to a Changing Retail Electric Business,"" raised the concept of the utility death spiral, in which higher costs for remaining customers force more and more customers to leave the grid. For those skeptical whether large companies would ever leave the grid, EEI specifically noted that even the threat of such a scenario has the potential to hurt utility earnings:The Rocky Mountain Institute followed up on EEI’s report in 2015, with ""The Economics of Load Defection"":In 2016, these predictions became very real, very fast in Nevada, when two of the state’s largest utility customers, MGM Resorts (MGM) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN), decided to defect from utility NV Energy (owned by Berkshire Hathaway) and purchase power from a third party, citing cheaper power from merchant solar energy as one motivation. The two companies accounted for an astonishing 6% of the utility’s energy sales, but the blow was softened by over $100 million in transition payments from the two companies. A third casino giant, Sands (LVS), opted to remain in the utility but pushed for greater customer solar choice.While the Nevada case was shocking, there have been other less flamboyant utility defections in recent years. One is the case of Microsoft (MSFT) in the service territory of Puget Sound Energy (PSE), which represents a case of partial defection: 80% of the company’s load will be taken to a renewable energy provider while 20% will remain on the grid.Such decisions are based less on storage than on conventional power-purchase agreement models where renewable energy is paired with low-cost conventional generation. But a recent study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory showed that falling energy storage costs will make grid defection economical for some large electricity customers.For this analysis, I wanted to look at whether the risk of utility defections on company earnings could be quantified sufficiently to evaluate relative risk. The analysis considers the following factors:Utility customers come in all shapes and sizes, but most states feature a handful of very large employers, with major headquarters and strong community involvement. Large companies also often have programs related to sustainability or environmental responsibility. As wind, solar, and energy storage fall in price, these energy sources become the cheapest and easiest way for companies to burnish green credentials—often while saving money.Background on state commercial energy sharesTo evaluate the grid defection potential, this analysis considers the top 50 employers in each of the five states and how many are members of either RE100 (companies committed to sourcing 100% of their energy from renewables) or the Rocky Mountain Institute’s Business Renewables Center. As of 2016, RE100 member companies had committed to consuming at least 146 Terawatt-hours of renewable energy.While most companies used the purchase of renewable energy certificates to meet commitments, both The Climate Group and Rocky Mountain Institute have reported a trend towards power purchase agreements. Under both methodologies, companies typically seek to offset all or a portion of their normal electricity use by purchasing an equal amount of energy sourced from renewables—but not necessarily at the same time of day. Typically, companies purchase renewable energy in the same geographical area, such as in the same state. So far, grid defection for renewable procurement is a rare event.While companies in a wide variety of sectors have joined RE100 and the BRC, three groups stand out as having a critical mass of consumer brands: finance (banks, insurance), food/beverage, and software/Internet. With a critical mass, it becomes a question whether consumer pressure, shareholder activism and industry best practices could push more and more large companies in these sectors to adopt aggressive RE goals of their own.State exposure to renewable consumer groups or industries:It’s notable that each state has at least one very prominent employer in one of these two renewable consumer groups. Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) in Atlanta is perhaps the best example. Surprisingly, Arizona comes out higher on this measure of utility defection risk than Minnesota. Both states play host to Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), itself a financing powerhouse in the global solar industry.Renewable energy potential also relates to grid defection potential. The five states here have starkly different situations, and policies when it comes to wind and solar. Arizona already has a respectable amount of solar photovoltaic power installed, for example, and the state’s flag is practically an advertisement for solar energy. (Pinnacle West reports that its peak output happens at 1 pm, compared to load peak at 6-7 pm when solar is producing at under 30% of its maximum. The case for customer-sited storage is obvious in such situations.) North Carolina is also one of the top solar states for installations, while Colorado and Georgia have decent solar resources with few solar installations. Minnesota and Colorado have ample wind resources and these two states border some of the windiest states in the nation.State renewable energy situations and overall grid defection ratingBy combining the various quantitative data, this analysis provides an overall qualitative rating of the risk of grid defection for the five states shown. The rating is normalized to a 0-10 scale, and weights two factors equally: (1) the overall size of the grid defection market as calculated from membership in renewable consumer groups or top renewable consumer industries, and (2) renewable energy market potential considering current shares of wind and solar plus the overall solar energy potential. The results suggest that Colorado has the highest grid defection rating, followed by Arizona. Minnesota ranks at the bottom due to its middling renewable energy situation and low share of top employers in renewable consuming industries and groups.As the states of Washington and Nevada show, utilities in any state can suffer from grid defection. Though it is widely said that utility defections have an outsized impact on earnings, since they reduce variable costs while fixed costs remain static, I am not aware of any systematic study across utilities that attempts to quantify this. The analysis here is an effort to arrive at an earnings impact approximation. Starting from the assumption of an across-the-board 10% defection of commercial electricity sales in just the five states listed here, this article derives an estimate of the revenue and earnings-per-share impact on the parent company. Earnings estimate impact factors in reduced fuel and operating costs, as well as reduced parent company income taxes. The analysis does not consider any transition payments or other regulatory compensation to the parent.Estimated earnings impact of grid defection on four regulated utilities:Estimated earnings impact of grid defection:Source: Montana Investment Analysis 2017 estimatesThis analysis of state grid defection potential combined with earnings impact estimates suggests Pinnacle West is in the most vulnerable position, followed by Duke Energy and then Southern Company. Although Colorado has high grid defection potential, Xcel Energy operates in several states, and Minnesota’s grid defection potential is relatively low.A factor not considered here is the effect on interest payments. As EEI and RMI both noted, given utility reliance on long-term debt financing, it is not necessary for utility customers to actually leave the grid for utilities to experience difficulties. Rating agencies have already taken notice of the grid defection issue. While the four utilities shown here have debt ratings above the industry average, these ratings could change quickly if a few more grid defections around the country change lender attitudes. One intriguing factor is that banks themselves are among the largest investors in renewable energy and are leading members of renewable consumer groups mentioned above. It’s not beyond imagining that a large bank could seek to reduce its energy spending while bolstering its own lending portfolio by gradually shifting both towards renewable energy.Utilities are powerful, and they have the potential to foresee and avoid defection scenarios. If high demand charges are the problem, utilities can ask regulators to lower or modify them to reduce the attraction of storage or going off the grid. If large customers defect, utilities can impose onerous transition charges, provided regulators allow it. (And courts can overturn such charges.) And if companies demand cheap energy from renewables, utilities can offer to provide it, and potentially earn regulated rates for renewable or storage investments.The utilities in these five states are among the most politically powerful in the nation. Southern Company and Duke Energy spent more on lobbying in 2016 than any other utilities. For years, North Carolina utility regulation has been roiled in controversy over efforts to fire the entire independent regulatory board and replace them with regulators required to have “industry experience.” Minnesota legislators are considering proposals to lighten utility regulation.Arguably no state can boast of more utility regulatory turmoil than Arizona, where the Federal Bureau of Investigations is investigating one former commissioner and another is under indictment for bribery. In the background allegations swirl around the influence of dark money in past Arizona Corporation Commission elections and whether Pinnacle West should be forced to divulge its campaign contributions. These issues have coincided with a fierce public debate in Arizona about the regulation of distributed solar.While utilities are powerful, utility efforts to craft favorable regulation can backfire, and that’s especially true with energy storage. Demand charges and time-of-use rates are a way for utilities to increase costs for customers with solar or other intermittent energy sources, either to improve fairness between solar and non-solar customers or as a way to discourage customer-owned generation entirely. The fairness debate about cost sharing is likely to continue and even worsen as solar market adoption rises. But the very uncertainties created by such debates, and the charges advocated by utilities to maintain their revenue base, tend to push customers to consider storage and self-generation options. Utilities may have to get creative about partnering with large customers to manage renewables and storage to avoid such outcomes.This analysis shows that investors have ample reason to be concerned about the potential impact of energy storage on grid earnings. While the timing and size of any major commercial grid defection is speculative, this analysis can help investors quantify the maximum impact, and the calculation suggests it can be substantial. Utility investors concerned about grid defection have several choices. One is to simply avoid regulated utilities with high demand charges such as those shown here. A second is to engage in pair trading, for example between PNW and XEL, which are the companies estimated as most and least exposed to this risk. A better strategy may be to focus on utilities with greater exposure to Utility-of-the-Future proceedings, which may be able to avoid customer defections by reducing the connection between energy sales and earnings.While I hope the analysis presented here appears reasonable, I also hope it provokes lively discussion given the many varied opinions about the topics presented, which are subject to wide uncertainties. I look forward to hearing your views.If you enjoyed this article or found this content useful, please consider sharing your comments and following my account."
4222427,40101,2018-11-15T08:32:33-05:00,"My investment club invested in Xcel Energy in July because it was healthy, fairly-valued and had clear potential for dividend growth.The utility's outlook has only improved. Its rate base is bigger. Its capital investment plans are larger. Its dividend growth is more stable because of an improved earnings growth target.The next bump to its dividend rate should occur in February 2019. Shares acquired below $53.33 should deliver a yield on cost of at least 3%.","When it was time for my investment club to make another investment in the Utilities sector this summer, we considered Black Hills (BKH), Northwest Natural Gas (NWN) and Xcel Energy (XEL). The club already had investments in Otter Tail (OTTR) and Duke Energy (DUK).We chose Xcel using our GRAVY criteria - “GR” owth “A”bility, “V”aluation and “Y”ield. We strive to invest in healthy, fairly-valued dividend-payers with clear potential for dividend growth. Xcel Energy has four subsidiaries - Northern States Power Minnesota, Northern States Power Wisconsin, Public Service of Colorado and Southwestern Public Service. It generates electricity and transmits natural gas to millions of customers in eight states. The utility prides itself on leading the industry in reducing carbon emissions by replacing its reliance on coal with renewable energy sources.Xcel's goal is to increase its dividend 5% to 7% annually. Its dividend growth potential was to be fueled, ultimately, by its $18.5 billion in capital investment plans. Earnings in the utility segment typically increase when the company's regulated rates increase. And, rate base growth is typically a result of capital investment.Since we made our investment in July, Xcel's outlook has only improved. Its capital investment plans now range from $19.3 billion to $21.1 billion through 2023.SourceThe rate base forecast has grown from $34.5 billion in 2022 to at least $36.5 billion in 2023.SourceIn the third quarter report, the long-term earnings growth forecast was updated from a range of 5% to 6% annually to a range of 5% to 7%. This goal now matches Xcel's target for dividend growth.SourceIn the third quarter earnings call, management expressed great confidence in the further expansion of its capital investment plans.At the November 2018 EEI Conference, Xcel illustrated the potential beyond the forecasted timeframe.SourceGrid modernization will also provide substantial opportunity for capital investment.SourceWhen Xcel first embarked on its transition to renewable energy, it purchased rather than owned production. Its goal now is to own 50% of renewables that come online. In the past four years, Xcel has been playing catch-up.SourceOn November 6th, Xcel Energy announced its acquisition of the Mankato Energy Center. Xcel's Northern States Power subsidiary had a tolling agreement with the Mankato plant through Southern Power until July, 2026. Southern Power is a subsidiary of Southern Company (SO). Calpine Corporation sold the natural gas-fired plant with capacity of 375-MW to Southern Power in 2016. The center includes a second unit, still under construction, which will increase capacity to 760-MW of electricity.In the 2018 fourth quarter, Xcel also expects to file a rate case for the buyout of a 70-MW wind PPA (power purchase agreement) for $135 million.SourceXcel's authorized framework at year-end 2017 equates to a rate base of $25.1 billion.SourceIn the third quarter, Xcel's Colorado Energy Plan was approved by the Colorado Commission. The plan will add 1,100 MW of wind, 700 MW of solar and 275 MW of battery storage while retiring 660 MW of coal. As well, Xcel has reached settlements on tax reform proceedings in Minnesota, South Dakota, North Dakota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Colorado, Texas and New Mexico.Xcel will file rate cases in the second and fourth quarters of 2019 for Colorado and Minnesota respectively for 2020 rates. It will also file rate cases in Texas and New Mexico in 2019 to add its Hale Wind Farm.With Xcel's third quarter results, the utility tightened its 2018 guidance and offered 2019 guidance for earnings. The full-year guidance for 2018 was originally $2.37 to $2.47, revised to $2.41 to $2.51 and now narrowed to $2.45 to $2.49. True to its new target of 5% to 7% EPS growth, the 2019 projection for EPS will begin in a range of $2.55 to $2.65.By 2023, Xcel's EPS, based on its targeted growth, should range from $3.13 to $3.49. The utility's optimism would lift the range to $3.31 to $3.49.Source: Author-created from company targetsWith Xcel's forecasted growth equal for earnings and dividends, by 2023, the dividend rate should be nearing $2.00 in a range of $1.94 to $1.98. This rate hits at the lower end of Xcel's targeted payout range of 60% to 70%. By 2023, the company will be nearing Dividend Champion status as it will have raised its dividend for 20 consecutive years.With its improving outlook, Xcel's share price has appreciated well the past few months, especially through the market turmoil in October and November. Because of this share price appreciation, its dividend yield is now lagging other utilities. The next rate increase should be announced in February, 2019. It is likely the rate will be at least $1.60. Thus, any price below $53.33 will equate to a yield on cost of at least 3%.On November 13th, Xcel closed a common stock offering with forward sale agreements of an additional 9,359,103 shares priced at $49. A common stock offering with forward sale agreements allows the price to be set but delays the issuance of shares and receipt of proceeds until settlement. Xcel's forward sale agreements will settle on or before February 7, 2020. The proceeds will total approximately $459 million.My investment club opted to invest in Xcel Energy in July because we deemed it to be healthy and fairly-valued with clear potential for dividend growth. With an improved outlook, it is even healthier now relative to its rate base and capital investment plans. Its potential for dividend growth is further stabilized with its upgraded target for earnings growth.We still see GRAVY when we analyze Xcel."

Revenue estimates for next year stand at $24.23 per share, giving a fair value of $31.50and $26.90 based on 5- and 10-year averages, respectively.The consensus from analysts is that earnings will rise at 4.68% per year over the next five years. If we take a more conservative number at 4.5%, running the three-stage DCF analysis with an 8% discount rate (expected rate of return), we get a fair price of $34.38.The following charts from F.A.S.T. Graphs provide a perspective on the valuation of XEL.(Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs)The chart above shows that XEL is slightly overvalued. The Estimates section of F.A.S.T. Graphs predicts that at a P/E valuation of 15, the 1-year return would be flat, confirming that the valuation is high.(Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs)ConclusionElectric utilities in general have seen slower sales industry-wide amid a combination of energy conservation, energy efficiency and shift towards independent power generation/natural gas usage. Coupled with the new regulations from the US government to reduce carbon emissions, electric utilities have started focusing a shift away from dirty fuels such as coal. XEL relies heavily on the electric utility business segment - making 90% of the company's earnings. As we've seen with other companies in the sector, this is resulting in falling revenues and competitors have resorted to buying natgas infrastructure assets. XEL needs a similar approach. Earnings are expected to grow at 4.68% over the next five years according to analysts and dividend growth is targeted to be in the range of 5-7% CAGR, although it might fall closer to its 5-yr and 10-yr average of 4.1%. The company appears slightly overvalued based on the valuation metrics used above. If we give equal weight to all metrics used above, we get a fair value of $31.74. An added risk for investors is the rise of interest rates by the US Fed. Bond substitutes such as utility stocks suffer in a rising rate environment and investors should remain cautious.Further ReadingBe sure to check out other stocks analyzed in this sectorFull Disclosure: None.

2445675,69105,2014-08-22T16:50:29-04:00,"I plan on purchasing a safe utility to raise the yield in my dividend growth portfolio.DUK and XEL present good utilities to analyze for a purchase.One utility has an edge when it comes to financial strength, valuation, fundamentals and dividend history.","In the next week, I will be adding to my dividend growth portfolio. The overall portfolio yield is currently under my target goal of yielding 4.5% as outlined in my plan. As such, I am looking to add a safe utility with a higher yield to bump up its current yield of 3.5%. After reviewing my watch list, I've narrowed it down to two utilities to analyze, Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE: DUK) and Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL). I will look at each company's financial strength, valuation, fundamentals and dividend history to determine which qualifies as the logical buy. For most research, I use Morningstar and S&P qualitative and quantitative stock reports. I also use Dave Fish's list of U.S. Dividend Champions found here.Beginning with financial strength, both meet my plan's minimum standard of meeting a credit rating of BBB or higher from Morningstar. Both DUK and XEL have a credit rating of BBB+. This is important because quality companies are great for long-term growth, which is the aim of this portfolio.S&P gives DUK a quality rating of B (Below Average) and XEL a B+ (Average). From this point, a good business metric to look at is a company's payout ratio. In other words, what percentage of earnings does a company payout to its shareholders? For smaller companies, the lower the better. The same goes for larger companies but the risk is inherently less if they are financially strong. DUK has a trailing twelve month payout ratio of 100.7% and XEL is 59.7%. I like XEL's ratio because anything under 70% has some space for dividend growth and they are a smaller company.For valuation, S&P gives DUK a fair value rating of 2 (moderately overvalued). Morningstar recommends a purchase price of $75.00 with a rating of three stars (fairly valued). S&P also gives XEL a fair value rating of 2 and is overvalued approximately 2% more DUK. Morningstar recommends a purchase price of $29.00 with a rating of two stars (overvalued). This means that either way I will be paying a premium unless the price of either takes a drop in the next week.Moving onto fundamentals, both have a beta of 0.26, which is low and typical for this sector. Utilities generally don't respond as much to fluctuations in the market as other sectors. Anything below 7 is great for my portfolio, according to my plan. DUK's P/E ratio is 23.2, which is above its historical average. XEL's P/E ratio is 16, which is a slightly higher than average. Its 10-yr historical P/E ceiling is 19.For buy, sell, hold ratings, S&P analysts give DUK a rating of two stars, (hold rating) and XEL a rating of four stars (buy rating). One equity clearly has the edge after analysis so far, but we still need to look at the most important element of a dividend growth portfolio. Dividends and dividend growth.As mentioned at the beginning of this article, the DGI plan sets an overall target dividend return of 4.5%. I don't purchase anything yielding below 2%. DUK's current yield is 4.41%, which would definitely push the portfolio closer to its target yield. XEL's current yield is 3.70, which is also good. But before I go chasing yield, I need to examine the stability and trends of their dividend growth rates.I prefer to find DGR trends between the years. DUK's 5-yr DGR is 2.7 and its 3-yr DGR decreased to 2.0. This year, it has remained at 2.0. Although stable, it seems to have dropped and is remaining stagnant. XEL's 5-yr DGR is 3.3 and its 3-yr DGR increased slightly to 3.4. This year, it has grown to 3.8. It occurs relatively stable and increasing.Lastly, an important metric to analyze is the Chowder Rule. Also known as the total dividend return rule, it is the sum of a company's yield and its 5-year dividend growth. For utilities, the sum of these two numbers should be 8 or higher. Unfortunately, both don't meet this minimum. DUK has a current chowder rule of 7.1 and 7.2. Although, with XEL's DGR trend, this might change in the near future.To circle back, I started this article with two goals in mind; increasing the overall yield of my dividend growth portfolio and buying a safe, strong company. Although DUK would raise the overall yield, my overall analysis currently favors XEL. In the next week, I plan on opening a position."

        Natural gas markets are fluctuating, and XEL's stock price is inversely related.
        Summer is a seasonal low for natural gas prices, and as NG prices rise, XEL will fall.","Xcel is a public utility company that is entering a bear cycle. While the Company pays a solid dividend which yields around 4% , its the revenues are stagnating. The Company has seen average residential electricity rates rise from 10.84 cents in 2012 to 11.89 cents in 2014. As these rates rise higher, solar and distributed generation become more economically attractive. Further, the price for Xcel's energy is unlikely to decline in the near future, as the Company will have to upgrade its coal-fueled facilities to keep up with government regulation. Additionally Xcel's stock price is inversely correlated to the natural gas market, when natural gas goes up, Xcel goes down. So if you believe as I do, that natural gas prices will increase over the next few years, Xcel is a sell.Company Positioning: from the 10-KXcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) is a holding company with subsidiaries engaged in the utility business. These subsidiaries are wholly owned public utilities that serve electric and natural gas customers in portions of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas and Wisconsin. from the 10-KCoal is Xcel's largest fuel input for electricity generation, it represents 46% of Xcel's portfolio. Natural gas is the second largest with 21% of Xcel's portfolio. The third largest is wind, with 15%. The Company has decreased its exposure to natural gas generation with approximately a -2% decrease from 23% of the portfolio in 2013 to 21% in 2014. from the 10-KAs you can see from the table above, Xcel's two major fuel sources , coal and nuclear, have low costs.Risk Management: from the 10-K from the 10-KDividends: from dividend.com from dividend.comXEL's dividend historically ranges between $0.2 - $0.4 per share, however for three quarters of 2003 the dividend was not awarded at all. The period in 2003 is the only period which the stock has not paid dividends. The yield of the dividends are typically around 4%.Expert Opinions: from Yahoo FinanceThe median price estimate for XEL is $37 per share which gives the stock a 15.66% upside at its current price of $31.99. The stock has a beta of 0.34 which implies that the stock's price is loosely related to the general market price.from Yahoo FinanceXEL's growth revenue is expected to slow down by 1% to 3.1% during 2016 year-over-year. Additionally, the Company's EPS is expected to grow by 5.8% year-over-year.from Yahoo FinanceThe quarterly earnings growth for XEL was -41.8% year-over-year. Further quarterly revenue growth fell by -7.50% year-over-year. These are not good signs for a public utility company, whose revenues are dependent upon rate-making policy.Natural Gas Market:XEL has a negative correlation of -0.51 with United States Natural Gas Fund (NYSEARCA:UNG) over a three year period. Summer is traditionally the season low pricing period for natural gas, as winter gets closer and closer we should begin to see the buyers enter to the market to hedge for winter exposures. Look for a seasonal up turn in natural gas markets as we near the end of summer.Recent News:Conclusion:Xcel's relationship with natural gas prices is really the major factor in recommending a sell of this stock. The natural gas market has been whip-sawing for the past year and considering we are currently near natural gas seasonal low, and with the adoption of LNG technology; natural gas seems poised for a climb. Xcel's dividend is a healthy 4%, but they have cut the dividend in the past when the company hit hard times. There is little bright side to speak of, with quarterly revenue declines of -7.5% year-over-year and a total yearly revenue growth of only 3.1%. Further, the experts do not have a solid consensus regarding the future price of the stock. I recommend reducing exposure to XEL because of its risk associated with the natural gas market."

This is best done by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries. What follows is a specific look at how Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.XEL data by YChartsDefensive Investor - must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 6/7Enterprising Investor - must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 3/5Valuation SummaryKey Data:Balance Sheet - 12/31/2013Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryXEL Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:Xcel Energy Inc. is a very intriguing utility company, having passed every requirement of the Defensive Investor except the current ratio requirement. It also qualifies for the Enterprising Investor by default because it is suitable for Defensive Investors, despite having a level of debt relative to its current assets that normally turns Enterprising Investors away. As a result, value investors seeking to follow the ModernGraham approach based on Benjamin Graham's methods should feel comfortable researching the company further. From a valuation perspective, the company appears to be fairly valued, having grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.42 in 2009 to $1.79 in 2013. This level of historically demonstrated growth supports the market's implied estimate of earnings growth of 4.15%, leading the ModernGraham valuation model to return an estimate of intrinsic value that falls within a margin of safety relative to the market price.Disclaimer: The author did not hold a position in Xcel Energy Inc.

1959881,23810,2014-01-22T11:50:34-05:00,,"Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) is an overshadowed, consistent company with solid potential as the company continues to expand operations and grow the already large customer base. This is not the type of stock that will double in a year, but it provides a solid foundation for any portfolio looking for steady returns and a nice dividend. Below is our introduction into the business model, the company's strengths, and buying opportunity that exists for Xcel Energy as the stock has pulled back off of 52-week highs of $31.79 over the course of the last 7 months.Investors and Wall Street continue to fail in realizing value in this company. The traditional issue with Xcel Energy is the way that Wall Street has viewed the company in the past. Traditionally, the company was viewed as the classic boring utility company that pays a steady dividend. This has led to a decline in the shares of Xcel Energy over the last few months as value has been found in other sectors. The question now is whether or not the company is undervalued as it continues to expand operations all over the country. The company has improving fundamentals and business prospects beyond 2014 and revenue will see a nice increase this year. The company has a market cap of $14.03 Billion and reports the next quarter on January 30, 2014. With this in mind, we value Xcel Energy at $30.00 by second quarter-end on May 30, 2014 and $32.00 by year-end 2014, an increase of 13.47% from current levels. We strongly feel that this company has the potential to see solid upside over the next year as it takes advantage of new market opportunities and continue to drive growth in the new businesses.We hope that potential investors are presented with a thorough and comprehensive view of Xcel Energy, and at the end can look at the facts presented and the insightful research in order to support our decision to buy or sell shares in the company examined. The discussion begins with an overview of the company and the different businesses and potential new products being developed.Xcel Energy at a GlanceXcel Energy Inc. engages in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution, and sale of electricity in the United States. It operates through Regulated Electric Utility, Regulated Natural Gas Utility, and All Other segments. The company generates electricity using coal, nuclear, natural gas, hydro, solar, biomass, oil, and wind energy sources. It is also involved in the purchase, transportation, distribution, and sale of natural gas. In addition, the company engages in developing and leasing natural gas pipelines, and storage and compression facilities, and investing in rental housing projects. It serves residential, commercial, and industrial customers, as well as public authorities in the portions of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.Xcel Energy Growth StrategyExpanding Existing OperationsA substantial portion of revenue growth has been generated by expansion into new geographic regions. The company will continue to seek opportunities to further increase business, and the primary focus should be on developing and expanding existing revenue bases by strengthening customer relationships, and adding new customers.Improved Asset ProductivityThe company is focused on improving the revenue generated from all core business operations. XEL can accomplish this objective through increased cost savings and aggressive investment structures, both of which are expected to increase over the course of the next year.Strengthening Customer RelationshipsXEL markets services and products to both existing and new customers that complement existing operations. The company seeks customers who will diversify the revenue base and present new opportunities going forward.Diversifying Service OfferingsXcel Energy is committed to providing customers a broad and growing range of energy products and services and continues to invest considerable resources toward developing a range of solutions for energy customers. Each product and service offering produced revenue growth in 2012 as well as 2013. XEL will continue to leverage nationwide and provide expertise and synergies by adding value to customers through diversified offerings.Large Energy Customer BaseXcel Energy has a diversified customer base in over 8 states with long-term contracts. This means that Xcel Energy is not too reliant on a single customer as a source of revenue, limiting downside on any changes in customer base. New contracts are renegotiated every three to five years, which gives Xcel insight into what the future looks like for continuing business. One important factor to look at with Xcel Energy is that the boost in average customer retention rate of over 98% since 2000 being a dominant energy provider in over 8 states, which provides stable revenue stream and protects against industry downturns on business.Business and Geographic Diversification in High-Growth AreasXcel Energy is well diversified across multiple operations of the utilities industry. This diversification affords it protection in the event of a downturn in any one sector while providing the ability to offer a ""one stop"" solution for energy customers. Higher growth areas such as North and South Dakota will prove to be important growth drivers going forward.Highly Efficient, Flexible Structure Drives Significant Free Cash Flow GenerationXcel Energy has a strong focus on return on net assets and high free cash flow generation in order to maximize shareholder value. The company has done a great job with cost control with active asset management strategies that results in a business model with a high degree of operating leverage. We wouldn't be surprised to see Xcel Energy increase the dividend as it continues to generate large amounts of cash in the future. Notice in the chart below how the operating expenses curve has flattened while revenue has remained consistent, with nice growth prospects going forward.Increasing Market Share and Growing Business with Current Customers - XCEL Energy has committed to expanding existing relationships with the current customer base while securing new customers. XCEL has done this and continued to take market share by providing a ""one stop shop"" for energy products. Several of the largest customers have recently switched to sole or primary service contracts with Xcel Energy, locking in long-term contracts that will guarantee solid revenue for the foreseeable future. There are also significant opportunities to expand intrastate with current North American contracts.How Xcel Energy Continues to Build Shareholder Value - Making Investments that Drive ValueUnderstanding the Main Components of the Xcel Energy Business - Constantly EvolvingNSP-MinnesotaNSP-Minnesota is an operating utility primarily engaged in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota. The wholesale customers served by NSP-Minnesota comprised approximately 4 percent of its total KWh sold in 2013. NSP-Minnesota also purchases, transports, distributes and sells natural gas to retail customers and transports customer-owned natural gas in Minnesota and North Dakota. It provides electric utility service to approximately 1.4 million customers and natural gas utility service to approximately 0.5 million customers. Approximately 89 percent of NSP-Minnesota's retail electric operating revenues were derived from operations in Minnesota during 2013.NSP-WisconsinNSP-Wisconsin is an operating utility primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in portions of northwestern Wisconsin and in the western portion of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The wholesale customers served by NSP-Wisconsin comprised approximately 6 percent of its total KWh sold in 2013. NSP-Wisconsin also purchases, transports, distributes and sells natural gas to retail customers and transports customer-owned natural gas in the same service territory. NSP-Wisconsin provides electric utility service to approximately 251,000 customers and natural gas utility service to approximately 108,000 customers. Approximately 98 percent of NSP-Wisconsin's retail electric operating revenues were derived from operations in Wisconsin during 2013.PS Colorado (PSCo)The wholesale customers served by PSCo comprised approximately 13 percent of its total KWh sold in 2013. PSCo also purchases, transports, distributes and sells natural gas to retail customers and transports customer-owned natural gas. PSCo provides electric utility service to approximately 1.4 million customers and natural gas utility service to approximately 1.3 million customers. All of PSCo's retail electric operating revenues were derived from operations in Colorado during 2013. A significant portion of PSCo's large commercial and industrial electric sales include customers in the following industries: fabricated metal products, as well as oil and gas extraction. Generally, PSCo's earnings contribute approximately 45 percent to 55 percent of Xcel Energy's consolidated net income.SPSSPS is an operating utility engaged primarily in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in portions of Texas and New Mexico. The wholesale customers served by SPS comprised approximately 33 percent of its total KWh sold in 2012. SPS provides electric utility service to approximately 381,000 retail customers in Texas and New Mexico. Approximately 74 percent of SPS's retail electric operating revenues were derived from operations in Texas during 2012. For small commercial and industrial customers, significant electric retail sales include customers in the following industries: oil and gas extraction and crop related agricultural industries. Generally, SPS's earnings contribute approximately 5 percent to 15 percent of Xcel Energy's consolidated net income.The Future of Xcel Energy ProjectsMinnesota ProjectsThe DakotasPlans in ColoradoRate Increases in WisconsinNew Mexico Providing ValueIn the case for Xcel Energy, considering the future prospects and improved pricing surrounding energy and utilities, the company appears to be undervalued compared to its peers. It will see increased spending from customers as pricing continues to improve in improved environments around the country. The recent pullback should be used as a buying opportunity as XEL continues to diversify the business and expand operations. The firm is trading at a discount in almost every valuation metric. Investors should focus on the firm's extremely low Price/Sales ratio (1.30) compared to competitors. When it comes to valuation, XEL appears to be a Buy at this point in time. The company also boasts a nice dividend yield at 4.00%.Sales Growth is another key metric to look at in the Utilities space. This is an area that has slowed for many companies involved in this sector as competitors needed to re-vamp business lines in accommodating the economic environment. With sales growth of 5.81%, Xcel has proven that a high quality energy product can be successful and a sustainable business. This sales growth does not appear to be slowing down based on the company outlook and sales for 2014. EPS Growth has also remained consistent at 6.64% over the last 5 years.Xcel Energy boasts a nice Operating Profit Margin at 17.12%, which outpaces other best of breed companies in the sector traditionally at 15.39%. This industry has been challenged by the high costs and tightening margins, but XEL has been very successful in terms of cutting costs and structuring contracts in a manner that will make it profitable.Obviously, when looking at these measures, XEL is succeeding on all fronts. When specifically focusing on the ROA of 2.92%, the company is performing well when it comes to the operating efficiency, but this is also an area where management has focused on improving. The ROE of 10.20% shows the solid performance in terms of the shareholders' rate of return on investment in the company. XEL has outperformed its peers in a tough environment and with big opportunities approaching in the near future, expect this outperformance to continue.Xcel Energy - A Solid Dividend PlayAnother area for investors to focus is on the company's dividend payout ratio and overall financial strength. The company currently has a 4.00% Yield and has consistently raised the dividend over the past 8 years. Investors should look for this trend to continue as the company continues to grow its customer base around the United States.What Investors Need To KnowThe next earnings release will give investors insight into how the firm is positioning its product portfolio for 2014 and beyond. Expect this company to outperform in the Utilities Industry as it has one of the industry's best business models and management teams. The 2013 fiscal year proved that the company has adapted to a new environment and can weather the tougher markets, while positioning the company for strong future growth. This is a firm that has a great opportunity to grow and become recognized over the next year as the environment surrounding the company begins to become more favorable.With this in mind, we value XEL at $30.00 by May 30, 2014 and $32.00 by year-end 2014, an increase of 13.47% from current levels. We arrive at this number by assuming that Xcel Energy will see an earnings increase of 7% over the course of the next 12 months, the company will begin to trade at an industry average P/E multiple (currently 14.9 and the industry average P/E multiple is 15.5), which gives us multiple expansion of at least 3%, and continued dividend increase representing an additional 3.5% (7%+3%+3.5%=13.5%).Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

(NASDAQ:XEL) generates and distributes electricity to residential, commercial, and industrial customers across states from Colorado to New Mexico, Minnesota and Michigan. Traditionally, utility companies are cash generative, steady businesses that pay good dividends. However, with winter approaching and the economy weakening, investors may have a conundrum to solve.Xcel shares are currently trading around $25.50, and the mean 12 month price target from analysts researching the stock is $25.63 (1% upside potential). This stock is trading above its 50-day exponential moving average of $24.51 and its 200-day exponential moving average of $24. The stock has been strengthening through the last couple of months, as the traditional rally in utility shares coming into the winter quarters has taken hold.Earnings per share for the last 12 months are $1.69, and these are expected to reach to $1.82 in its next fiscal year (ending Dec 2012). These numbers place the shares on a trailing price to earnings ratio of 15.01, and a forward multiple of 13.97. The sector average training price to earnings ratio is 14.66. For investors looking at dividend paying stocks, Xcel’s payment of a dividend of $1.04 last year gives the stock a yield of 4.10%, and is covered more than 1.6 times by its earnings.In an industry sector that pays some of the highest and most reliable dividends in the market, Xcel’s dividend is fairly standard. Allete Inc (NYSE:ALE) yields 4.7%, with the dividend covered 1.4 times by earnings, and American Electric Power (NASDAQ:AEP) yields 4.8%, with cover of 1.6 times, and CenterPoint Energy Inc (NYSE:CNP) yields 3.8% with a cover ratio of 1.5 times. On a dividend basis alone, there really is very little to differentiate the energy utilities.Current operating margin at Xcel is 16.05%, with a return on assets of 3.91% and a return on equity of 10.24%. The current revenue from its income statement is $10.45 billion, and last quarter’s revenue showed year on year growth of 5.50%. Xcel has cash of $117.72 million, and a total of $9.97 billion in debt. The company’s debt/ equity ratio is 119.59. In comparison, the smaller Allete Inc has a debt/equity ratio of 75.1: far more manageable. Though it is usual for utility companies to carry high debt levels, with cash flow easily able to service the debt, the financial crisis of 2008 has shown that the unimaginable can always happen. High debt levels worry me as an investor.Looking at the 12-month chart, XEL shares have performed broadly in line with the S&P 500 index and recovered from their 12-month low in late August. However, with shares near 12-month highs, and rising in expectations of a good winter trading period, I am not convinced of their ability to push far higher. Industrial activity may weaken further in reaction to economic conditions both at home and abroad, and this could prove a drag on earnings moving forward.[Click to enlarge]  The company has recently announced that it is planning to increase the size of its Windsource business, urging business customers to lock into five-year deals. Xcel says such deals could act as a hedge against further electricity price rises caused by rises in the price of coal and natural gas in the future. Customers would have to pay a premium on top of current bills, though to encourage customers to sign up to the program, Excel has said that it will be cutting the program’s prices by half.Xcel recently issued $250 million of senior unsecured notes, paying a coupon of 4.8%, to pay off some of its short term debts. At the time Fitch, the ratings agency, assigned a BBB+ rating BBB+ rating to these notes, but also stated that it was concerned about Xcel’s capital expenditure program that will see it spend approximately $2.6 billion per year, through to 2015. Fitch sees Xcel’s cash flow as being sufficient to service its short term funding requirements, but the debt and expenditure concern is there nonetheless. This is a concern that I share.Whilst I am a fan of utility companies, their cash flow, steady business model, and dividend payments to shareholders, I think the share price of Xcel has risen far enough at this time. Any further weakening in the economy will harm its revenues, and its high level of debt and necessary capital expenditure may prove problematic in these tough economic times. Its need to cut prices on renewable energy programs indicates that it is feeling the pinch from competitors. Shareholders would do well to take profits ahead of a winter period that may not prove as revenue positive as previous.

In the U.S., bond yields will remain timid, which increases the attractiveness of predictable high dividend stocks such as Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL), a Midwest electricity provider.Xcel provides investors with regulatory controlled revenue growth, which helps insulate shares from volatility.  Last quarter, the company saw its electricity sales increase to $2.62 billion last quarter, up from $2.44 billion the prior year. And natural gas revenue rose to $194.9 million from $170.6 million. This kind of clarity has supported 7% compounded annual earnings growth since 2005.In Q3, the company's earnings were $0.69 versus $0.62 last year, bringing 9-month earnings to $1.43 versus $1.34 in 2010. Much of the upside came from interim rate increases in Minnesota, where NSP-MN earnings rose to $0.29 from $0.24 last quarter and $0.62 versus $0.48 in the first nine months, respectively. Overall, rate increases contributed $41 million more to margin last quarter. And, rates have contributed an additional $97 million in earnings so far this year.Earnings strength supports Xcel's target of a 10% annual shareholder return. Since 2005, dividends have grown at a compounded annual rate of 3.2%. Internal targets call for 2-4% annual dividend growth going forward, suggesting investors will continue to receive competitive yield. At current share prices, the stock is yielding 4%, roughly in line with the 3.9% yield on the utilities spider ETF (NYSEARCA:XLU).And, even more flexibility comes from the company's issuance of $700 million in low cost debt, which reduced financing costs and provided for the retirement of its higher cost preferred. In the first nine months, total operating expenses fell to 82.2% from 83.2% year-over-year, a reflection of solid management.The company hopes to expand multi rate proposals. This would provide additional revenue clarity and reduce the lag between costs and rates. Overall, the company is targeting annual earnings growth of 5-7% and is guiding to the top end of its $1.65-$1.75 forecast for 2011. Next year, it expects earnings of $1.75-$1.85 thanks to additional rate increases.As investors look to insulate portfolios from risk with dividend paying stocks with predictable top and bottom lines, utilities remain an attractive alternative. With significant regulatory clarity and a history of dividend growth, Xcel offers a stable yield with price upside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in XEL over the next 72 hours."

It just keeps chugging away, impressively unstoppable. Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) reminds me of a locomotive. Xcel Energy is an electricity and natural gas utility that operates in Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin. XEL has a 3.3% dividend CAGR since 2005. The dividend is currently 3.76% per year. XEL has a 6.6% EPS CAGR since 2005. This generally translates into good dividend and good stock price growth. With 3.4 million electric customers and 1.9 million natural gas customers it is a very stable company.XEL trades at a PE of 17.12 and an FPE of 15.2. This is quite reasonable for a strong dividend payer with a next 5 years average analysts' EPS per annum growth estimate of 5.11% (and a history of 6.6% EPS CAGR). The good cash flow from operations in Q1 2012 of $477.5 million puts it yet further into the safe and stable category. So far this year the stock price has been immune to the world economic slowdown. The FY2012 and FY2013 average analysts' EPS estimates are virtually unchanged over the last three months. Nothing seems to stop the company. Very little seems to slow it down. It has achieved or exceeded EPS guidance for every year since 2005. Its presence in many different US states energy markets gives it further immunity to the problems of any one state.Aside from producing good, steady growth in its EPS and its dividend, XEL gives good value to its customers with lower than national average rates. The following chart shows where some of XEL's bills fall in the national spectrum.Denver, Minneapolis/ St. Paul, and Amarillo in the chart above are all XEL rates. XEL also tries to lead environmentally. The chart below shows how it has and is in the future planning to move to cleaner burning fuels for generating power.Further XEL has made strong efforts to decrease the amount of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide that its existing plants produce. XEL has reduced carbon dioxide pollution by -17% since 2005. It has reduced sulfur dioxide pollution by -44% since 2005. It has reduced nitrogen oxide pollution by -50% since 2005. In each case we are talking about thousands of tons of pollution, which are no longer being produced. XEL has also improved customer satisfaction from 89% in 2007 steadily to 93% in 2011. This is impressive, especially considering XEL's geographically diverse assets. When companies are this well managed, it is easy to believe that they will continue to be successful. It has been spending approximately $2-$3B per year to refurbish and to expand. It plans to continue on this course. This should ensure future success, especially when XEL can normally recover all such expenses from its customers.The two year chart of XEL lends some technical direction to this trade.The slow stochastic sub chart shows that XEL is near oversold levels. The main chart shows that XEL has been in a consistent uptrend for the last two years. Both the price line and the 50-day SMA are strongly above the 200-day SMA. The price line is also firmly above the 50-day SMA. XEL is not overbought, but the two year chart indicates that it can most profitably be bought when the price is below its 50-day SMA. It may be best to wait for this situation to occur, but you can also average in. Perhaps a combination of the tow strategies is appropriate. In any case XEL does look like a utility that an investor looking for safety, yield and slow steady growth would like to own, especially in these very uncertain times. With a Beta of only 0.28, it is not very susceptible to overall market forces. This can be very comforting, when the market may plummet on bad economic news at almost any time. A few other low Beta utilities with good dividends are: Southern Company (NYSE:SO) -- 0.12, Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) -- 0.18, and Duke Energy (NYSE:DUK) -- 0.19.NOTE: Some of the fundamental fiscal data above is from Yahoo Finance.Good Luck Trading.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in XEL over the next 72 hours."
288774,24135,2011-08-21T11:07:26-04:00,,"Xcel Energy Inc.(NASDAQ:XEL) is a leading electric utility. XEL provides electricity services to approximately 3.4 million customers and gas services to 1.9 million customers across parts of Colorado, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Texas, and Wisconsin.XEL has a forward dividend yield of about 4.5% based on a recent closing price of $23.31 per share and the author's estimated forward dividend of $1.045 per year. The most recent quarterly dividend was $0.26 per share. XEL has had a solid track record of dividend growth over the past 5 years with a compound annual growth rate around 3.2%. Earlier dividends were higher, almost always above $0.30 per share per quarter.Created from data from Yahoo Finance. The first observation is that the yield spiked significantly in 2002. Just from this information it is unclear what happened.Created from data from Yahoo Finance. The above graph clearly shows that XEL cut its dividend substantially, resulting in a significant drop in stock price on the order of 70%. The dividend was cut from $0.375 to $0.188 per share, a drop of about 50%. Since the graph looks at trailing twelve months dividends, the yield spike up substantially. However since that time, dividends have climbed higher and the stock price has tracked upwards as well. However, neither the stock price nor the dividend have recovered to those levels.Looking forward XEL can be valued using a dividend discount model (DDM) and some assumptions around growth rate and equity hurdle rates. The equity hurdle rate can be calculated at 4.3% using the capital asset pricing model and a beta of 0.37.This value is extreme especially given that XEL has posted dividend growth around 3% on a very consistent basis. A DDM would thus suggest that XEL is extremely undervalued. Even using a 6.3% equity hurdle rate would result in a potential upside over 30%.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Disclaimer: This article is for informational and educational purposes only and shall not be construed to constitute investment advice.

3799916,80836,2016-01-08T19:52:46-05:00,"I wrote several articles about utility companies. Xcel is another company that can suit dividend growth portfolios.It will give investors medium yield and medium growth for the medium term.The firm has several growth prospects that will support the growing EPS and dividends, but the valuation isn't too compelling.","IntroductionI wrote on several utility companies in 2015. Although this sector might seem boring for many investors, it can offer some real value and safety to dividend growth investors. It is crucial to divide the companies by yield and growth as I suggested in a previous article. As I stated there, I am willing to sacrifice current yield for growth, and I believe there are more utility companies that offer medium growth and medium yield to accompany Wisconsin Energy (NYSE:WEC), and Avista (NYSE:AVA) that I already own.Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) is a utility company that seems to have the profile of Wisconsin Energy, which is my favorite in the sector. It offers a medium yield, and the outlook is for medium growth. In this article, I will analyze and try to figure whether I should initiate a position in this company.XEL is a holding company. Through its four utility subsidiaries, Northern States Power Company, Minnesota; Northern States Power Company, Wisconsin; Public Service Company of Colorado; and Southwestern Public Service Company, it is engaged principally in the generation, purchase, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity, and in the purchase, transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas.FundamentalsFirst, I will look at the fundamentals of the company. Revenues are growing pretty slowly, but this is typical to this sector, as these companies are monopolies which are tightly regulated. Revenues grew from $9.62 billion in 2005 to $11.68 billion in 2014. This is a CAGR of 2%, which is low, but acceptable if earnings grow at a faster rate. Significant growth in revenues is many times achieved through acquisitions in this sector.XEL Revenue (Annual) data by YChartsEarnings per share is a whole different story. EPS over the past decade grew steadily at over 5% annually. A nice mid-single-digit growth for a regulated monopoly is appreciated. The EPS grew from $1.23 in 2005 to $2.03 in 2014. This is a CAGR of 5.2%, which is enough to support the dividend growth. The company and analysts forecast that EPS will grow at the same pace in the medium term.XEL EPS Diluted (Annual) data by YChartsDividend is the crucial element for investors in this sector. It grew very modestly over the past decade, and therefore, the payout ratio was decreased. The dividend grew from a quarterly payment of $0.225 in 2006 to $0.32 in 2015. This is a CAGR of 3.7%, but the last two dividend raises were two times the average raise at 7%. The payout ratio is sustainable at 60%, and the company wishes to maintain it between 60% and 70%. Therefore, the dividend hikes will probably be around 6% in the coming years. The current yield is 3.5%, and it will grow soon as the company will probably raise its dividend next quarter.XEL Dividend data by YChartsThe company has been funding its growth through both debt and equity. Therefore, the amount of shares outstanding grew, but, as the money was wisely used, EPS kept growing as well. In addition, the debt load is well managed. The credit rating varies between BBB+ and A, which is pretty safe.ValuationXcel Energy is what I called in a previous article a type 2 dividend growth stock. It has medium yield and medium growth. Therefore, I will compare its valuation to Wisconsin Energy, which is also a type 2 dividend growth stock, and they are both from the same sector.I will look at the P/E ratio, P/S ratio and the P/B. I will concentrate on the future metrics, as I am willing to buy shares for the long run, and I care less about their past performance.XEL PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsThis is an interesting comparison as both companies try to maintain 60-70% payout ratio, and Wisconsin Energy is growing faster than Xcel Energy. As the metrics show, XEL is traded for a cheaper valuation. This is justified by the lower growth. The difference between 6% and 7% might seem irrelevant, but when it compounds annually, it becomes significant.I believe the difference in all the valuation metrics should be larger. From my point of view, the valuation of XEL is a little bit high, especially given the market is so volatile. I think from the valuation point of view, it is better to initiate a position when the yield is closer to 4% at around $32, and if the market continues with its volatility, it might get even lower.OpportunitiesI will now try to look at the opportunities and risks. Sometimes great opportunities justify a premium in the valuation. The first opportunity is the diversification of this business. The company is diversified with its products; electricity and now natural gas. It is also diversified geographically, as it does business in many states. True, this diversification may be confusing, as most of its income comes from Colorado and Minnesota. However, the exposure to the South gives the company some room to grow outside of its natural habitat. Texas is a quickly growing state, and this is a good opportunity for XEL.Xcel Energy is a utility company. Therefore, it suffers from tight regulations. However, these regulations are due to the fact that the company is a local monopoly. Residents must rely on its services. Therefore, regulators are limiting the price increases. Xcel's management team managed to increase its earnings and dividends despite the regulations. It aims to bring shareholders 6% annual increase in EPS under the tight regulations. This shows me that the management knows how to deal with the regulators, grow the business, and manage debt that funds capex.President Obama said that by 2030, renewable energy will account for 20% of the market. This will happen as the government will lure companies to invest renewable energy projects. XEL is ready for that; it invests in plants that use natural gas which is cheap and clean and renewable energy mainly in Colorado and Minnesota. The company also invests in its transmission network and gas infrastructure. All this is done with the support of the regulators.Talking about the regulators in these eight states, they were very good for XEL. They support its grid modernization and the new investments, and they also allow price increases that will help the company to grow, and eventually earnings will grow as well. When the regulator is the king, their willingness to allow the company to increase prices for gas and electricity is crucial.RisksThe first risk is the constant use of debt. This sector requires a lot of money and credit to fund major projects like new power plants and modernization of the massive transmission network. Therefore, the company must have constant access to credit. In a time when interest rates are raising, the debt may become more expensive. It will harm earnings and FCF. However, I must note that XEL knows how to deal with its debt, and the current credit rating is the proof.The regulation that I mentioned before works well for XEL at the moment. However, as I said, the regulator is the king, and changes in their policy can shake the well-regulated companies. If, for example, regulators limit the allowed return on equity, earnings will drop. Regulations are here due to the fact that XEL is a monopoly, but they also make it more dependent.The current valuation is also a risk. It is at the fair valuation territory, but I think that some of the company's peers like WEC enjoy a better valuation. As the interest rate is about to rise slowly and the market is very volatile, this can pose a short-term and even medium-term risk for investors.A big part of the business is in the Rust Belt. The growth there is slower, and the weather is harsher. It requires more gas for heating, but the costs of maintenance are also higher. This is why I am glad the company is more diversified, and operates in the southern part of the country as well.ConclusionInvestors in American companies should be grateful that they have so many fine companies to invest in. The stock exchange is full of many good and stable companies, and XEL is definitely one of them. The fundamentals are strong, the outlook is bright, valuation is fair, and there are several growth prospects for the future of the business.However, in order to invest in the company, I must buy its stock. At the moment, the valuation is fair, but not compelling enough for me. I will be much more comfortable to invest in XEL at a price range of $32-33, and if the market keeps being that volatile, we might see the $30-31 range again. You can always initiate a tiny position that will help you track the movement of the share price."

273138,21992,2011-06-03T01:26:21-04:00,,"This post is a follow up to Preferred Stock ETFs: Beware the Heavy Concentration in Financials and 5 Preferred Stocks for High Income and Safety both of which are the latest in an ongoing series first introduced in the article Best Post-QE2 Opportunities Lie Beyond Stocks providing a detailed analysis on investment strategies outside of the stock market leading up to the end of QE2.Trading opportunities are available in preferred stocks just like they are in regular common stocks. Sure, most invest in preferred stocks for their yield. But this doesn’t mean that you have to buy it today and hold it until it gets called away. One of the great things about preferred stocks is that, when selected at the right time, they can offer attractive high quality capital gains opportunities to go along with their generous yields.When I focus on a preferred stock investment opportunity, I am looking first at the capital gain potential. The yield is also terrific, but this is typically secondary in my investment decision. What is attractive about preferred stocks from a trading perspective is the various levels of protection that come along with the investment. First, the par value for most preferred stocks is $25 per share. While most preferreds trade close to $25, it is not unusual to see prices deviate by 20% or more from this par value at any given point in time. Such price movement implies that worthwhile capital gains opportunities exist in these names. Second, the price volatility is sufficient but still fairly predictable in a tight range, which sets up attractive low risk trading opportunities. Also, you are one step higher above common stocks in the capital structure. So in the event the underlying company runs into solvency or liquidity troubles, you have more time to act in advance of any issues and a greater probability of recovering more of your principal investment.In my post 5 Preferred Stocks for High Income and Safety, I introduced five preferred stocks that I am monitoring for such trading opportunities. The list was made up of non-financial preferreds that are investment grade rated and demonstrated relative price stability through recent market pullbacks including the financial crisis. They are also not callable until at least 2012. This list is shown below:Before going any further, I thought it would be worthwhile to respond to a very good point that was raised in several of the comments from my previous post on the topic. All of these preferred stocks trade at a premium to par. In other words, the price is over $25 per share. As a result, if the preferred ended up getting called by the issuer at $25 per share, you would end up with a capital loss on your investment. It is for this reason that this strategy applies best to stocks that are not callable for at least six to nine months or more. For any preferred stock trading strategy, I would expect that I have sold out of the position well before it becomes callable. And in the unlikely event that I do end up holding a position to call, I will have at least been collecting the yield income along the way to help neutralize any downside. But the objective is to first realize a capital gain with the potential of capturing some generous yield on top along the way for a solid overall total return.Xcel Energy 7.60 (XCJ) presented the first such trading opportunity following my previous post. After reaching an intraday high of $28.24 just four trading days earlier on May 23, XCJ corrected lower by -4% to $27.12 by May 30. This price hit right on the upward sloping trend and immediately bounced higher. As a result, I stepped with limit orders to purchase XCJ at $27.19 on May 31. Click to enlarge: This new XCJ position sets up for a nice trading opportunity. First, the price remains in an upward sloping trend on a yield adjusted basis, and the potential for this upside continuing has support given that QE2 is soon ending on June 30. Second, XCJ has various levels of strong downside support including at the 50-day moving average at $27.36, the upward sloping trend line now around $27.20 and the 200-day moving average at $26.79. Third, if XCJ returns to its previous highs in the $28.20 to $28.30 range, this would provide a +4% capital gain, which is more than six months worth of dividends if I purchased XCJ with only the yield in mind. Finally, if XCJ hits this $28.20 to $28.30 range and is technically overbought with an RSI of 70 or above, that’s my signal to exit the position and lock in the capital gain. Otherwise, it may be worthwhile to hold the position and collect the next dividend scheduled for a few weeks on July 1, thus combining the capital gains power of the position along with the healthy yield.In the two days after the XCJ purchase, the price already jumped by +3.2%. This highlights once again the trading opportunities available in preferred stocks, as 42% of the yield you expect to receive in an entire year from holding this preferred has been achieved through a capital gains trading strategy in just two days.Two points are worth mentioning. First, this type of trading strategy is obviously better employed in a qualified account such as an IRA. But with that being said, it also has merit in a taxable account. After all, an investor would be paying ordinary income tax rates on the yield received from their preferred, so paying the same tax on short-term capital gains essentially makes this an opportunity to create additional synthetic income in taxable accounts. Second, employing such a strategy does require watching these types of positions on a daily basis and having the patience to implement and wait on limit orders to ensure the right price realization on both the buy side and the sell side.I will check back if and when other trading opportunities present themselves in the five names listed above.Disclosure: I am long XCJ.Disclaimer: This post is for information purposes only.

271086,22326,2011-05-20T12:41:03-04:00,,I was screening on Barchart for an electric utility with great price momentum and came across XCEL Energy (NASDAQ:XEL). When I say a sure thing I mean that the company is rated 100 for both price stability and earning predictability so what you see is what you get with a minimum of surprises. The company has already received a 20 year license on one of its plants and is soon expected to receive another one on another. They also have been granted new price increases in several other jurisdictions. I like the utility on its price momentum alone.
249779,20568,2011-01-31T14:50:08-05:00,,"Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) came up with its fourth quarter and full-year 2010 earnings results on January 27, 2011. The company’s full-year results comfortably reached the higher end of its guidance range helped by improved electric margins. Though the company’s results missed analyst expectations for both the periods, the company continued providing a high level of customer satisfaction and successfully met or exceeded its energy efficiency and conservation program targets. The company also continued to progress on various projects and programs which should help the company achieve its long-term earnings goals.Analysts’ sentiments on future earnings remain stable as the company is expected to perform smoothly to reach its project goals going forward.Turning to Recent ResultsElectricity and natural gas company Xcel Energy announced fourth quarter 2010 operating earnings of 29 cents per share versus 37 cents per share in the year-ago quarter, reflecting a decline of 27.6%. The results of the company were lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 31 cents per share.Xcel's operating earnings of 2010 were $1.62 per share compared with $1.50 per share reported in 2009. The results again lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2 cents.Xcel Energy's total revenue for fourth-quarter 2010 was $2.56 billion versus $2.61 billion reported in the year-ago period, reflecting a decline of 2.0%. The year-over-year decline in revenue was due to lower contribution from Natural Gas and Others. Reported quarter revenue surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.52 billion.Xcel Energy's total revenue for 2010 was $10.3 billion versus $9.6 billion reported in the prior fiscal year, reflecting a growth of 6.9%. Despite a 4.5% year-over-year decline in Natural Gas contribution, the growth in total revenue was attributable to higher contribution from Electric and Other segment. Fiscal year 2010 revenue of the company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $10.2 billion.We have discussed the quarterly results at length here: Xcel Misses EPS, Beats SalesAgreement Following the year-end 2010 earnings release, the estimate revisions of analysts remain largely stable. In the last 7 days, only one (out of 13) analyst has slashed its earnings estimates for fiscal 2010, while none of the analysts raised their 2010 estimates. Estimate revisions for 2011 also followed the same trend as 2010.Annual estimate revisions, over the last 30-day period, also revealed the same trend as the 7-day period, with only one analyst each lowering its estimate for both 2010 and 2011. There were no upside revisions in the 30-day period as well.MagnitudeDespite one analyst cutting estimates for 2010 and 2011 over the 7-day and 30-day periods, annual estimates for both 2010 and 2011 remained unchanged at $1.73 and $1.84, respectively.Long-term NeutralXcel Energy offers a comprehensive portfolio of energy-related products and services operating in 8 Western and Midwestern states. The company’s diversified portfolio of operations helps to hedge the specific risks emanating from any one state’s regulatory environment and economy.Looking ahead, we expect Xcel to grow its earnings, driven by its diverse operations, ability to achieve constructive rate case outcomes and visibility for future rate-base growth. On the recent conference call, Xcel Energy reaffirmed its 2011 ongoing earnings guidance of $1.65 to $1.75 per share.Xcel Energy has shown tremendous progress on its growth projects along with maintaining its position as an environmental leader. During 2010, the company completed the acquisition of two natural gas power plants in Colorado, commenced commercial operation at the Comanche Unit 3 and Nobles wind farm, began construction on the CapX2020 transmission project and received commission approval for its Clean Air Clean Jobs plan, which is designed to reduce emissions in Colorado by at least 70% to 80%.In addition to operational goals Xcel Energy continues to successfully meet its financial objectives as well. Recently, the company raised its annual dividend by 3 cents to $1.01 per share, representing a 30% growth. The company also saw its credit ratings improve as S&P raised its rating on Xcel Energy and three of its operating companies by one notch.Minneapolis, Minnesota-based Xcel Energy is a holding company, with subsidiaries engaged primarily in the utility business. Through its four regulated utility subsidiaries the company serves 3.4 million electricity customers and 1.9 million natural gas customers. The company mainly competes with Consolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) and Ameren Corp. (NYSE:AEE).We believe Xcel’s favorable geographic, regulatory, environmental and financial position bodes well for the company. However, we believe these positives have already been reflected in our current target price, leaving little room for further upside in the near term.Xcel Energy currently retains a Zacks #4 Rank (short-term Sell rating). However, we maintain our long-tern Neutral rating on the stock."

The fuel recovery mechanism, which allows the company to recover current expenses, came in handy, otherwise revenues and margins would have been affected by volatile input costs.Natural gas: Revenue at this segment increased 0.6% to $170.6 million from $169.6 million a year ago.Other: Segment revenue in the reported quarter was $17.3 million versus $16.0 million in the year-ago period, reflecting a growth of 8.3%.Operational UpdateTotal operating expenses climbed 11.4% to $2,060.2 million from $1,849.4 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase in expenses was mainly due to a 13.1% increase in input costs used for generation of electricity. However, operating expenses, as a percentage of total revenue, declined year over year, which benefited the operating results of the company.Operating income was $568.3 million versus $465.1 million in the year-ago period, showing an improvement of 22.2%.Interest expenses increased to $138.5 million from $129.7 million in the year-ago period. The increase was mainly due to higher long-term debt levels to fund investment in utility operations, partially mitigated by lower interest rates.Financial UpdateXcel Energy ended the quarter with a total debt of $9.3 billion and a total debt to capitalization of 55%, compared with $8.6 billion of total debt and a total debt to capitalization of 54% in the year-ago period.The company from time to time issues debt and equity to refinance debts, fund operations and for other general corporate purposes. During the quarter, one of its subsidiaries, NSP- Minnesota, issued 250 million of five-year first mortgage bonds with a coupon of 1.95% and $250 million of 30-year first mortgage bonds with a coupon of 4.85%. Another subsidiary, Public Service Company of Colorado, plans to issue $400 million of first mortgage bonds in the fourth quarter of 2010.DividendOn October 20, 2010, the board of directors of Xcel Energy paid a quarterly dividend of 25.25 cents per share to shareholders of record on September 23, 2010, as declared on August 25, 2010.GuidanceXcel Energy reaffirmed its earnings guidance for 2010 in the range of $1.55–$1.65 per share. The guidance assumes normal weather pattern for the rest of the year.

The state's Public Utilities Commission was due to hold a hearing on the proposal Wednesday, and that was canceled with Xcel decided not to pursue the plan for now.The new fee would've affected only new customers who install solar after April 2010.Xcel said that many of its customers who own solar energy systems aren't paying their share of maintaining the grid because their systems typically generate more energy than they need. The customers send the excess electricity to the grid and get credits on the bills.Because they don't owe the utility money at the end of the billing cycle, they don't pay the grid maintenance fee that is folded into the regular rate that non-solar customers pay.By Xcel's calculation, a customer owning a 4.5-kilowatt system would pay about $1.90 per month under the proposal. But the fees could be a lot higher because it's based on each customer's use of electricity procured by Xcel, such as during the night when the solar panels aren't generating electricity.Xcel's proposal appeared unusual. Investor-owned utilities in California, for example, don't impose a grid fee for their solar customers."
114893,21568,2009-01-15T05:38:37-05:00,,"By Ucilia WangXcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL), the largest utility in Colorado, is trying to settle a case with the state over allegations that it oversold wind energy credits between 2005 and 2007.An administrative law judge is looking at the $2.6 million proposed settlement, reported the Associated Press.Colorado’s Public Utilities Commission said Xcel sold more credits for wind energy generation than what it actually produced from wind farms in its Windsource program. The voluntary program allows Xcel’s customers to tag on an extra charge on their utility bills in support of wind energy generation. The program has about 47,000 participants.Other utilities in the country have similar programs. The PG&E, for example, has a ClimateSmart program in which customers can pay (about $5 per month for a typical household in Northern California) the utility to support projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.The proposed settlement calls for Xcel to fork over $1.6 million in order to lower the fees that program participants will pay in 2009. The utility would spend an additional $1 million to buy renewable energy credits to fulfill a state mandate that requires utilities to buy a certain amount of electricity from renewable sources such as wind or solar.Xcel sold more credits than what it produced because only two wind farms, with a combined capacity of 60 megawatts, could be used for the program, Xcel spokesman Joe Fuentes told me.“We had more demand than we had supply,” Fuentes said.Obviously, the Colorado PUC and various groups that pointed out the practice and asked for a change didn’t think Xcel had a good excuse.What Xcel hopes to be able to include all of its wind farms and other types of renewable energy generation in the Windsource program, Fuentes said. The utility has nearly 1.1 gigawatts of wind generation capacity now.Xcel expects the administrative judge to issue a decision by the end of this month. After that, the utilities commission will review the proposed settlement and make a final decision."
152872,21568,2009-07-31T10:24:24-04:00,,"By Ucilia WangXcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) is proposing a fee for its Colorado customers who feed their excess solar electricity to the grid, a practice that some say would dampen consumers' demand for solar.The utility has asked the Colorado Public Utilities Commission for approval to impose that fee, which Xcel estimates would be around $1.90 per month, or $23 per year, for a customer who owns a 4.5-kilowatt system.Xcel said the fee is fair because solar energy system owners not only send the solar electricity they don't use back to the grid during the day, they also rely on electricity supplied by Xcel during the night.But it's easy for these customers to avoid paying for the costs of maintaining the grid, said Tom Henley, a spokesman for Xcel.That's because when the bills are tallied, what these customers get from ""selling"" the excess solar electricity at retail rates to Xcel is greater than the cost of using Xcel's electricity. The customers get credits on their bills for feeding the excess electricity into the grid instead of getting a payment from the utility.If they don't owe Xcel money, then they don't pay for the grid maintenance cost, which is folded into the electric rates that non-solar customers pay. Xcel current charges 9 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity it procures.""We don't think solar power customers should have access to the backup of the grid and access to the grid for selling energy without paying for it,"" Henley said.Henley declined to disclose how much the utility believes it could have collected from those solar energy system owners.Solar energy advocates see the proposed fee as a penalty. Beth Hart, head of the Colorado Solar Energy Industries Association, told the Wall Street Journal that the cost could decrease demand for solar energy systems.Xcel appears to be making an unusual request. Investor-owned utilities in California, for example, don't levy such a fee.""We are doing anything we can to encourage our customers to go solar,"" said Vanessa McGrady, a spokeswoman for the Southern California Edison.The public utilities commission is scheduled to hold a hearing on the proposed fee next Wednesday. Xcel's proposal calls for imposing the fee on customers who install solar energy systems after April 2010.Only customers who take advantage of the utility's solar rebate program would be subject to the fee.The program, which began in March 2006, has enrolled about 5,660 residential and commercial customers to date. Funding for the program comes from a 2 percent charge tacked onto the monthly bill. But those who don't owe Xcel for power used don't pay for the charge.The program has doled out $86 million worth of rebates, Henley said.Although Xcel estimates that the fee would be roughly $1.90 per month for a customer with 4.5-kilowatt system, the actual fee could differ widely.Xcel would determine a minimum fee for each solar customer that is based on the power used by that customer over the preceding 11-month period. The utility would take the peak use during that period and multiply it by 26 cents per kilowatt hour to come up with a minimum fee for the monthly bill.The peak power refers to the electricity provided by Xcel to the customer.Solar power customers would pay the minimum amount unless they use so much of the electricity provided by Xcel that they would simply pay for the Xcel energy at the same rate as other non-solar customers."
101987,21568,2008-10-26T10:48:17-04:00,,"By Ucilia WangThe recent passage of federal solar investment tax credits has prompted one Colorado utility to reduce the rate it will pay to solar installers by 40 percent and give the installers one day to submit paperwork to qualify for the old rate.Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL), the state's largest utility, plans to reduce the rate it pays for renewable energy credits from $2.50 per watt to $1.50 per watt for solar energy systems with a capacity of less than 10 kilowatts, said Joe Fuentes, an Xcel spokesman. The change will largely affect residential solar installations, which average 4 kilowatts to 5 kilowatts in capacity in Colorado, the utility said.While the decision to lower the rate wasn't a complete surprise, the way the utility delivered the news to solar installers had some fuming.Xcel notified the rate change in an email to solar installers and in a letter to the state's Public Utilities Commission on Thursday afternoon. Xcel gave installers until 11:50 p.m. Mountain Time Friday to apply for the credits worth $2.50 per watt, Fuentes said.The short notice has prompted solar installers to scramble to file paperwork, while also raising raised concerns about the outlook for the state's solar industry, an industry group said.""We at Colorado Solar Energy Industries Association are concerned about how this will slow the growth of the industry moving forward,"" said Jim Welch, the association's president, in an email to Greentech Media. ""We also are concerned [with] how the process went with Xcel where we had wanted to be involved on the discussion of rebate change and Xcel rebuked our requests for meetings.""The purchase of RECs is part of the Solar Rewards program set by Xcel in 2006 to encourage solar energy use and help the company meet a state mandate that requires investor-owned utilities, such as Xcel, to have 20 percent of its electrical power coming from renewable sources by 2020.The utility has to tell the commission how it runs the program, but it doesn't require the commission's approval to set the rate.In addition to buying RECs, Xcel also provides a $2 per watt rebate for all solar energy systems with up to 100 kilowatts in capacity, whether they are located on residential or commercial properties. The rebate remains unchanged, Fuentes said.The utility decided to lower the REC rate that affects residential solar installations because it believes the new federal incentives for residential solar energy systems will bridge the difference, Fuentes said.The U.S. government passed the solar incentives in early October as part of a large tax break package for many types of renewable energy (see Lawmakers Approve Energy Tax Credits, Bailout).The legislation, to take effect in January, will remove the $2,000 cap for investing in residential solar energy systems. In effect, a system could cost 30 percent less for its owner as a result of the new law. Because of the high cost of solar energy systems, solar installers often own and maintain the residential systems and sell the power to the homeowners.By Xcel's calculations, these new federal incentives will not increase the cost of owning a solar energy system by much. It would cost a solar energy system owner one percentage point more under the new REC rate, Fuentes said.A 4.5-kilowatt system would cost about $14,175 after factoring in the new $1.50 per-watt REC rate, the $2 per-watt rebate and the new federal incentives, according to the letter Xcel sent to the utilities commission.A 4.5-kilowatt system would cost $13,750 if the old, $2.50 per-watt REC rate and the $2 per-watt rebate stays in place and the federal incentives are factored in."
56730,20585,2007-12-10T03:30:56-05:00,,"I've begun acting as a consultant to the Colorado Energy Efficiency Business
Coalition [CEEBC] in a rulemaking docket for Demand Side Management [DSM] case
before the  Colorado Public Utilities Commission [PUC].  In the 2007
Legislative session, the Colorado legislature passed enabling legislation
calling for utility-wide Demand Side Management programs for natural gas utilities. 
To date, all DSM in Colorado has been focused on low income customers. Crucially, the legislation allows for non-energy benefits, such as increased
comfort, economic multiplier effects (i.e. jobs), and reduced volatility of energy costs be
included in the evaluation of the benefits of programs.  Since financial
benefits are a relatively small part of net benefit, this allows the
implementation of a large
number of DSM programs with large net benefit, but which might have only small
financial benefits.  The Commission will effectively decide whether those programs will be implemented
in this rulemaking.  The utilities in question, led by Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL), are currently only willing to include minor, easily quantified non-energy
benefits, such as water savings in an energy-efficient dishwasher.A Seemingly Easy DecisionSuppose you have the following choice for your home or business:
A. Spend $1000 to get improved indoor air quality, fewer drafts and
  hot or cold spots, quieter operation of equipment, less condensation on
  windows and walls (and associated mold growth), less noise from outside the
  building, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, an increase in the local
  economy, less air pollution, increased national energy security, and $15 per
  month for ten years.B. Spend $750 and save $15 a month on your utility bill for ten
  years.  You might or might not get some of the benefits in A, but
  they will be smaller than the benefits you would have gotten with A
  (except for the cash.)C. Keep the money.D. Spend $350 and save $7.50 a month on your utility bill for ten
  years.  Like B, you may get some small, unknown fraction of the
  other benefits in A.Utilities Chose C.Until a few years ago, electricity regulators and legislators were choosing C
on behalf of their customers, by meeting increasing demand for energy with new
power generation.  They are now starting to realize that the cash-only
internal rate or returns for options A and B are quite
attractive.  (These returns are 11% and 19%, respectively, similar to
buying a CD with that interest rate.)  Because the non-financial benefits
of A are difficult to quantify, most regulators only consider the cash,
and pick option B.Option B is a traditional DSM program, which bases the decisions on
which actions to take solely on the financial impact.  It is also
essentially what Xcel Energy
is arguing for in the utilities commission docket, despite their widely announced
proposed doubling of their DSM target.  What Xcel does not mention is that
the current DSM program (choice D, in the above analogy), was the result
of a
settlement agreement made with environmental groups who had opposed a massive
coal-fired power plant in a previous PUC docket.  In my opinion, the
environmental groups got very little for their concession of not opposing the
750 MW Comanche 3 power plant (now under construction), but at the time, they
faced a Public Utilities Commission hostile to environmental concerns, and they
may have been lucky to get as much as they did.  I seriously doubt any
would have agreed to the settlement in today's political climate.""A"" Excellent ChoiceFortunately, legislators and regulators are awakening to the advantages of A.  
The New York State Energy Research and
Development Authority [NYSERDA] has been conducting a continuing evaluation
of their ongoing Energy $mart DSM program, which means that they chose A,
and then went on to quantify the non-cash benefits.  Because of the controversy
about valuing emissions, the environmental benefits were not included in this
study, but they used a series of questions similar to the poll above, and some
advanced statistical analysis, to figure out what people would actually be
willing to pay for the other benefits.What they found was that the net present value of all benefits from the
Energy $mart program were worth approximately twice as much as they would seem
to be worth when measured on a traditional, cash-only basis (called
""Scenario 1 TMET"" in the study.)  And this does not include the
environmental benefits listed in A, nor energy security.  In other
words, people would be willing to pay well over twice as much for the benefits
in option A, as they would be willing to pay for the cash alone.ConclusionStudying non-energy benefits is still an inexact science, and one of the
things CEEBC is pushing for in the PUC docket is to make sure that we do our own
study of non-energy benefits in Colorado, so we can better understand what we
are getting (besides an excellent financial return) for our money.  That
understanding should lead to more DSM programs, because the results will be
better and higher valued as people begin to recognize the true worth of energy
efficiency.  This has already benefited the companies, such as Energy
Service Contractors, and providers of energy efficient products and the
controls which enable them as more and more individuals, businesses, and
utilities (gently prodded by the regulators), begin to choose A.DISCLOSURE: Tom Konrad  and/or his clients have positions
in these companies mentioned here: XEL.  (They're actually not bad, as utilities
go, although they have been much more active on the renewable energy and energy
efficiency front in Minnesota than they have been in Colorado.  This is, in
my opinion, mainly the result to the proactive stance of regulators.)"

182526,21568,2010-01-14T09:46:04-05:00,,"By Michael KanellosWe thought they meant pay us $5 million.That was a common initial reaction from execs at smart grid start-ups when mega utility Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) approached them about participating in SmartGridCity, an ambitious plan to wire up approximately 50,000 homes around Boulder with smart meters, two-way communications and other technologies.Then reality set in. Instead of paying these companies, Xcel wanted them to pay $5 million to participate, according to sources at smart grid companies approached about participating in the project. By paying, participants would effectively become a signature partner in the project and in all likelihood be in line to participate in larger commercial rollouts of ideas fostered during the project.If company didn't want to pay, it could participate by providing equipment, technology and/or services. If Xcel didn't get any takers, the utility then said it would be willing to buy equipment.But the $5 million figure stuck in people's heads, particularly execs from start-ups that have spent the last few years raising money from VCs.The tariff in part explains why many smart grid companies did not participate in the program, according to some.""There are no Silver Springs, Itrons and Landis + Gyrs in there,"" said one executive.An Xcel spokesman declined to discuss details of any transactions with participants or other companies. Nonetheless, he added that the project wasn't cheap. The total budget came to ""upwards of $100 million,"" he stated. The SmartGridCity network has largely been completed, he added.He further added that smart grid technologies aren't cheap. The grid functions 99.92 percent of the time and, unlike a computer networks, is spread over hundreds of miles of ever-changing terrain and must content with varying weather conditions. Smart grid has become popular because it's cheaper than building additional power plants to accommodate new demand, but it's still not easy. Invariably, it involves installing new hardware across distributed service areas. (The point in some ways is supported by the VC funding that the supposedly capital lite segment has attracted in the past year. Silver Spring alone has raised $275 million.)Others sources said the unusual strategy came because Xcel didn't want to see a rate increase to pay for it. For companies that had excess inventory or wanted a test bed it made sense, but for many companies with existing, revenue-generating pilots underway, it wasn't the best deal.The program did attract partners. Xcel, after all, covers eight states and garners over $9 billion in revenue a year. GridPoint, which has raised over $220 million from investors and has been actively acquiring companies, has provided demand management and electric car charging technologies to the project. Other participants include Current Group and OSIsoft. Current Group's President Ray Gogel served as CIO at Xcel while Mike Carlson at GridPoint came from Xcel. But in the end, Xcel paid for most of the project."
102457,20307,2008-10-28T16:17:31-04:00,,"The battered solar sector has received some more alarming news, this time from the Minneapolis-based utility Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL). According to the Denver Post, the company on Friday cut the credit offered on a typical household photovoltaic system to $6,750 from $11,250.The Post noted that in a letter to the Colorado PUC, Xcel said it was cutting its solar subsidy because Congress voted to lift the $2,000 maximum on the federal solar investment tax credit. Essentially, Xcel said that because customers will get a bigger boost from Uncle Sam, it could cut its own discount without much of a change in overall consumer system costs. The story notes that Xcel now estimates that a typical rooftop solar system of 4.5 KW will cost customers $14,175 after all credits and rebates, versus $13,750 before Xcel’s credit reduction. While not a big change in overall costs, the move does have the effect of sharply increasing upfront costs, since the tax credit is not received immediately.In a research note this morning, Hapoalim Securities analyst Gordon Johnson asserts that if Xcel’s move starts a trend, “there could be material retrenchment in residential solar demand.”"

We anticipated this move and expected final regulatory approval to be slow in coming to fruition. What ensued for the remainder of the year was more in line with wishful thinking than reality. A number of acquisitions were announced only to be terminated in the beginning of 2007. Nonetheless, Utilities have continued to trade at above normal multiples. What we dub Utility Mania actually started overseas in the U.K. eventually powering a surge in U.S. utility equities. Xcel Energy (NASDAQ:XEL) went along for the ride. 99% of revenue is regulated and increases were granted in 2006. Electricity rate increases in Texas are on the table for 2007. Electricity growth is limited to about 2% so profits can only grow substantially from margins. This is where Xcel has some obstacles to overcome. The effective tax rate for 2006 was 24.2% due to one time tax credits. The anticipated effective tax rate for 2007 is 29.5%. This should offset any improvement in rates and efficiencies. Earned credits from pollution reduction are somewhat a double edge sword. On the one hand, converting the coal-fired Riverside and High Bridge units in Minnesota to natural gas should result in cost savings. On the other hand, Xcel has already added three natural gas-burning units in 2006, increasing reliance on natural gas pricing. An interesting point was made during an office discussion regarding the contrasting effect from possible higher natural gas prices. Regulated electricity would suffer from higher prices yet at the same time distributed natural gas might benefit from a linkage mechanism that might be employed in Colorado and Minnesota. Using 2005 verified figures, revenue from electricity and gas distribution was at a 3 to 1 ratio. We couldn't find the cost and margin breakdown. Without this information it is impossible to calculate the exact trigger point for negative returns. We estimate 2007 earnings to be flat for the year at $1.36. Xcel may increase the dividend which always gives a good impression yet doesn't really affect the fundamentals. Dividend distribution rates have vacillated between 61% and 101% over the past ten years. Currently, ttm P/E is hovering over 18. We expect Utility Mania to fizzle out in 2007 and a return to normal P/E range of 14 to 17.   P/E ratio source: Standard & Poor's Disclosure: no conflicts."

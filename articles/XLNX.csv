4382260,71685,2020-10-28T17:03:39-04:00,AMD is buying Xilinx for $35 billion.AMD has been given a gift by the stock market to buy Xilinx.The deal may never have happened otherwise.,"AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) announced a $35 billion acquisition for Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX). It is an all-stock deal, which means shareholders of AMD will be diluted, likely pushing the stock lower. Overall, it might be a great deal for the two companies to come together, but both companies' shareholders don't seem to benefit. The deal will be structured with AMD holders receiving 74% of the new company, while Xilinx holders will get 26%.From another standpoint, Xilinx stockholders are receiving 1.7234 shares of AMD. Basically, if AMD's stock goes up or down from this point, Xilinx will follow. Should the market go through a period of turmoil or investors decide to re-rate AMD's stock, Xilinx holders may never see the $143 per share noted as the deal price. That price was determined using the volume-weighted average price of the past 10 days, which was $82.9726. Based on AMD's current price of around $76 on October 28, the deal values Xilinx around $131.70.It makes little sense as to how this deal works from a shareholder standpoint. AMD has been the beneficiary of a stock market that has risen dramatically from its March lows, which helped push AMD to record prices. Along the way, the stock benefited from a tremendous amount of multiple expansion, with the stock's one-year forward PE soaring to more than 44 times one-year forward earnings estimates.In fact, among other semiconductor companies, only Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a higher PE multiple, which stands at 48. Then comes AMD, and then comes Xilinx at 37. The next highest is ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML), at 31. This comes against an average of around 24 for other names in the SMH semiconductor ETF.(Data from Refinitiv)Clearly, AMD has a faster earnings growth based on analysts' consensus estimates than most of its peers. That does give the stock a pass to trade with a premium valuation to its peers. But we also know that AMD's PE seems to ebb and flow by a wide margin, ranging from 20 to 50 over the past 3 years. It seems that, right now, the market is giving AMD the upper end of its valuation range.In essence, AMD has benefited from using its inflated share price as currency to acquire Xilinx. It means that, over time, should AMD disappoint investors and the share price drop, Xilinx will suffer all the same. The deal isn't expected to close until the end of 2021.The technical chart continues to suggest that AMD's actually falls even further. There is a very bearish pattern known as a head and shoulders in the chart. Should the stock fall below $75, it would confirm that bearish pattern, which likely leads to a decline to around $69.50. That would allow the stock to fill a technical gap created at the end of July. Should the stock fall below that support at $69.50, it could drop to around $62, filling another technical gap.Additionally, the stock has a relative strength index that is trending lower. Worse is that the RSI hasn't even hit oversold levels yet. It would need to drop to 30. It suggests that bullish momentum is leaving AMD.Overall, it seems as if AMD may have caught a break with investors boosting its price to all-time highs. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been able to acquire Xilinx."
4384630,63973,2020-11-03T15:38:37-05:00,"AMD and Xilinx are not a great strategic fit in traditional terms but there seems to be enough here for the AMD-Xilinx deal to work.The article discusses the key items of synergies, opportunities and challenges.There is also little doubt that the deal team did a disservice to AMD investors.","Advanced Micro Devices' (AMD) announced acquisition of Xilinx (XLNX) is not intuitively obvious. It is not one of those strong strategic fits that jumps at investors. AMD's main line of business are CPUs and GPUs which primarily go into PCs, servers, and game consoles. Whereas, Xilinx's programmable chip business is highly diversified and has no overlap with AMD's product line. The companies are not direct competitors and neither do they have similar sales force or field support or channels. The product types and life cycles of the companies are also entirely different - while the name of the game at AMD is high volume and rapid obsolescence standard products, Xilinx products are low volume long life cycle custom products.Xilinx datacenter business is being touted as the main reason for the deal but, as the table below shows, it is a small $106M business in the most recent quarter. Certainly not supportive of the $35B sticker price.The segment with most sales, AIT, is not even relevant to AMD. So, what gives? Why would AMD want to do this acquisition?AMD stated scale and breadth of products as one of the key reasons for the acquisition. As can be seen from the image below from the M&A presentation, product depth increases outside of the key PC and gaming segments.In a more analytical sense, here are the likely reasons why AMD may be pursuing this acquisition:AMD identified some of these synergies in its M&A presentation.It is unclear which one of these vectors, or a vector not discussed here, is dominating AMD's need to acquire Xilinx but early indications are that datacenter strategy may be driving this acquisition.Operationally, Xilinx is a different beast from AMD. Consequently, Xilinx can and should be run largely as an independent company except in areas where there is close collaboration with the CPU/GPU side of the business. This reduces the scope for synergies, but a few key opportunities do exist. AMD claims $300M in cost synergies. Here are some of the key areas where the impact is likely to be significant.The biggest synergy in operations likely comes from the supplier front. AMD can consolidate Xilinx volumes on the wafer and packaging front to get better pricing from suppliers. Especially on the wafer front, AMD may be able to get considerably lower prices at TSMC (TSMC) for leading edge capacity than Xilinx can. It would not be surprising if Xilinx margins move up several hundred basis points under AMD. The resulting impact on overall AMD margins could be meaningful.On the sales and support fronts, there are likely to be some operational synergies between AMD and Xilinx in key segments such as DCG and WWG. While these are unlikely to be large, a few million in annual savings is possible.On the design front, there could be synergies in procuring and using shared tools and shared IP. Operationally, some of the foundry and packaging interface operations could be consolidated for greater efficiency. A few tens of millions of savings may be possible.As far as administrative overhead goes, some of the financial reporting and public company overhead can be reduced potentially saving a few million dollars.Overall, the primary synergies are likely to be on the fab front with more moderate gains on opex and SG&A.Based on the guidance provided in the most recent quarter, Xilinx calendar Q4 revenues could be around $775M whereas AMD Q4 revenues could be around $3B. However, this immediate quarter numbers are not very meaningful as it is unlikely that a merger can close in less than three quarters.Given the current growth vectors, it is likely that, by the time the acquisition closes in late Q3 or early Q4 2021, AMD will be posting $4B+ quarters whereas Xilinx may be posting $800M to $1,000M quarters. At this level, Xilinx is likely to be less than 20% of combined company's revenues. Unless AMD can find way to rapidly grow the Xilinx 20% of the business, Xilinx could become a growth drag on the Company in 2022 and beyond. The exception here would be if Xilinx enables a much faster take rate of AMD CPUs and GPUs - that could help make up for slow growth in the Xilinx part of AMD.On the plus side, Xilinx sports higher gross margins than AMD currently and the gross margin gap is likely to remain by the time the merger concludes. Xilinx can provide a nice gross margin boost to AMD which will be seen positively by investors. Assuming Xilinx business does not deteriorate significantly, the deal should be accretive in terms of earnings.However, the deal should be measured by the numbers when it closes and not when the deal is announced. And, with this lens, AMD is giving out far too much equity for what it is getting in return. Given the growth discrepancy between the companies, AMD is committing to significantly overpay for Xilinx and the deal team did a disservice to AMD shareholders.In terms of the deal itself, AMD does not have much cash on the books and deal needs to be financed primarily with equity or debt or convertible debt. Given Xilinx's strong balance sheet, healthy historic margins, and historically low interest rates, a debt fueled deal could have made sense. However, it is understandable that AMD management was averse to accumulating debt.AMD and Xilinx are historically based out of San Francisco Bay Area and share a similar entrepreneurial product driven culture. Xilinx CEO Victor Peng hails from ATI (the GPU company that AMD acquired) and subsequently became a Vice President at AMD. Not only is there some amount of cross pollination between AMD and Xilinx over the years but there is also an existing relationship between the companies to address the data center market.While the nature of developing, selling, and supporting FPGAs is different from dealing with standard and semi-custom products, culturally, there does not appear to be any major fit issue.While the deal itself is not an obvious one and has some warts on it, it does make sense on several vectors. With this acquisition, it appears that AMD is aiming to be a total solution provider to datacenters akin to Nvidia and Intel. This could pay off well with more rapid adoption of AMD products into the datacenter. Time will tell.In the meantime, AMD stock has taken a to be expected hit due to poor deal terms. Thankfully for AMD investors, the Company's core x86 and GPU prospects are very strong and the Xilinx deal is but a small hiccup on the way to long-term growth."
4383862,25120,2020-11-01T14:38:17-05:00,"AMD is acquiring Xilinx after what has been a much rumored deal.Xilinx's shareholders received fair value for their shares in terms of sales, as its higher margins are offset by slower growth.AMD is obtaining crucial capabilities and will become a more diversified growth play following the deal, although at a steep price.Despite great actual and product leadership, I have some reservations here, solely relating to the valuation.","After rumors surfaced already in recent weeks, the much anticipated tie-up between Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Xilinx (XLNX) is now a fact, or at least the announcement is. Given the somewhat higher price of the target than rumored and a small setback seen in the market, shares of AMD have seen a small drop, yet I would not read too much into that.Nonetheless, expectations on AMD and the new combination remain very high, yet remain supported as long as AMD continues to report just rapid growth, certainly versus some (struggling) peers.The deal in which AMD will acquire Xilinx values the latter at $35 billion deal as the transaction will be an all-stock deal, making that relative valuation count in such a scenario. Given that AMD's stock has comfortably outperformed that of Xilinx so far this year, this timing element looks favorably.Investors in the target will receive 1.7234 shares of AMD for every Xilinx share they currently own, which boils down to $143 per share in terms of Xilinx's stock based on the 10-day weighted average of AMD's stock before rumors about a deal broke. Hence, investors in Xilinx will on a combined basis own 26% of the equity of the combination which is valued at $135 billion on a pro-forma basis.The deal is driven to create a leading higher performance computing company, giving the combination more firepower against the likes of Intel (INTC) and Nvidia (NVDA), with the latter recently announcing a big deal for ARM (NASDAQ:ARMH) of course quite recently.AMD touts the product portfolio and diverse growth markets, with the deal being immediate accretive to margins, earnings per share and cash flow generation. AMD will bolster it positing towards the data center, gaming, PC, communication, industrial, aerospace and automotive, among others, setting the company up for multi-year growth.With no debt incurred as a result of the all-cash deal, the pro-forma implications are relatively easy to see by simply adding the performance of both businesses. On top of this, some synergies are seen. AMD pegs these at $300 million, to be achieved within 18 months after closing, notably on shared infrastructure and improved purchasing power. That being said, this will take a while as closing is only seen late in the calendar year 2021.The deal presentation reveals some key pro-forma numbers which reveal that the multiples at which Xilinx is valued in this deal look much more compelling compared to AMD. This comes in part because the latter has real growth engines, is very well led and many investors expect a (partial) defeat for Intel going forward.AMD reports sales of $8.6 billion on a trailing basis as Xilinx will add $3.0 billion in revenues. Of the $11.6 billion combined revenue base, Xilinx contributes 26% of pro-forma sales, exactly the same as the share ownership in the combination.That is where the equality ends as the margin profile of Xilinx is much better than that of AMD, with gross margins of 70% being 25 points higher than AMD as the $1.0 billion in operating income contribution makes up more than 40% of pro-forma non-GAAP operating income number of $2.4 billion. The combination will operate with net cash of $2.5 billion, as we can now make some calculations.Alongside the deal, the company reported its quarterly results, as AMD has a diluted share count of 1.23 billion shares. With Xilinx given a 26% equity stake in the combination, I peg the combined share count at 1.66 billion, translating into a $135 billion equity valuation at $81 per share, although shares have now fallen to $77 in part amidst a small setback in the markets.Of course, the valuations are highly distorted because of great momentum in the third quarter. AMD's third-quarter revenues rose more than 50% on both a quarter-on-quarter and year-over-year basis to $2.8 billion. This suggests that AMD reports revenues at $11.2 billion a year, as the company reported net earnings of $390 million for the quarter on a GAAP basis, or $1.56 billion a year.Xilinx reported its second-quarter results last week with revenues down 8% on an annual basis to just over $3.0 billion run rate, for a combined run rate of $14.2 billion, suggesting it only contributes 21% to the current run rate in sales. Net earnings came in at $194 million for the quarter, or about $780 million a year. Combined, this comes in at $2.34 billion a year, as synergies could boost this number to $2.6 billion.Given the diluted share count, this provides a boost to the earnings run rate of AMD, yet it only comes in around $1.50 per share per year, about equal to about the net cash holding of the firm. Thus, with operating assets now trading around $75 per share, this translates into a 50 times earnings multiple, and the enterprise value comes in around 9 times annualised sales.The deal with Xilinx makes sense as it will provide AMD with much more R&D and cash flow power, and while the deal is accretive to margins, it is dilutive to the growth rates. That said, the deal is really driven by adding great R&D capabilities to reinforce the growth and potential of the combination going forward.As the valuation multiples are very steep at 50 times earnings, I do not see a compelling reason to get in onboard, yet one has to appreciate that AMD has been driving great operating performance thanks to its leadership and focus on R&D. After all, the company is delivering on >50% revenue growth which stands in sharp contrast to the small revenue declines reported by Intel, which is still 6 times as large in terms of the revenue base and is superior to many other peers as well.Real innovation and R&D is what counts in such a market as besides superior growth, it is AMD which on top of growth still has more room on the margin front as well. Intel does report GAAP operating profits in a range of 30-35% which is still far higher than the 15-20% margins reported by AMD at this moment.If the company can close the margin gap and report operating margins of 30% on pro-forma sales of around $14 billion, the picture looks already a bit different. With operating profits of $4.2 billion, no net interest expenses due and assuming 10% tax, that allows for earnings to increase 50% on the same revenue base to about $2.25 per share. This still results in very demanding valuation multiples, although growth reported by AMD provides a lot of comfort.You get the point, investing in quality and winners is probably a long-term winning strategy in an industry which is not commoditized and capabilities really matter. AMD has been a great recovery story yet it feels very late in the innings, with the great dealership and transition now publicly getting acknowledged, making me a bit fearful that the best days are behind us already, that is for the shareholders at least."
4381837,22148,2020-10-27T16:35:07-04:00,AMD agrees to acquire Xilinx for $35 billion.The deal is immediately accretive to current earnings due to low AMD margins.The combined company needs to execute in order to not cut the previous trajectory of a standalone AMD.Investors should Buy the weakness as CEO Lisa Su has never failed to deliver in the past.,"As rumored by the market, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) agreed to acquire Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) for $35 billion. The merger creates an industry leader in high performance computing with a large TAM to attack. The deal over-shadows blowout Q3 results from AMD, causing the stock to fall in initial trading. My investment thesis remains bullish on the stock due to the vision of CEO Lisa Su.Image Source: AMD websiteMy prior warning was that a deal with Xilinx would naturally come through as an accretive deal due to the higher margins of the target company. AMD delivered such a deal with an all-stock acquisition of Xilinx for $35 billion. Xilinx shareholders obtain 1.7234 shares of AMD common stock and will own ~26% of the new company.The deal promises to deliver the leader in high performance computing with a combined 13,000 talented engineers and over $2.7 billion in annual R&D investments. Also, as mentioned in my previous research, the deal only offers a limited synergy amount of $300 million within 18 months of closing the merger. The amount is meager, considering the listed combined enterprise value of $135 billion. Based on Xilinx 2021 revenue estimates of $3.4 billion, the merger synergies aren't even crossing the 10% threshold.Xilinx offers AMD access to adaptive platforms in key areas such as 5G and automotive. According to the merger documents, the combination leads to an enormous opportunity with a TAM jumping to $110 billion, up from previous AMD standalone estimates of $79 billion for 2022.Source: AMD/Xilinx merger presentationXilinx adds about $31 billion to the TAM, though their numbers are listed as for 2025. The big addition is the $21 billion embedded market and an additional $10 billion data center. The company adds ~28% of the TAM while contributing 26% of the shareholder ownership.Just looking at the combined financial picture based on trailing numbers, AMD will see gross margins jump from 45% to 51%. In addition, operating income margins surge to 21%, up from 16%. All of these amounts are before eliminating $300 million in annual synergies.Source: AMD/Xilinx merger presentationThe deal easily starts accretive based on the numbers from the last 12 months. Clearly, Xilinx contributes nearly the same operating income and higher free cash flows despite the semiconductor company being substantially smaller than AMD.AMD reported that Q3 revenues jumped 55.6% and smashed analyst estimates by $240 million. EPS beat analyst estimates by $0.06 providing the highest level of earnings in years at $0.41 per share.The company is firing on all cylinders, with the Computing and Graphics division beating estimates with revenues of $1.67 billion. Even more impressive, the EESC business had sales of $1.13 billion versus consensus estimates at $1.06 billion. The EESC segment was the laggard at the company, but the ramp of new consoles and data center sales led to an incredible 101% sequential revenue increase.The numbers from AMD are a stark contract to Xilinx where FQ2 revenues actually fell 7.9% from last year. The major difference is that Xilinx has far higher gross margins at nearly 70%, while AMD is down at only 44%.Even at 4x the revenues, AMD only generated a net income of $501 million in the quarter, while Xilinx had $203 million for the period. The deal is accretive for this reason, but this doesn't mean that the long-term earnings potential of AMD isn't capped to an extent.The only major troubling part of the deal is the capped growth. AMD was forecast to grow at long-term rates closer to 20%, while Xilinx is down to only 10% growth.Data by YChartsMy previous research along with analysts had AMD generating substantially higher revenues and profits in a few years backed on the theory reinforced by the strong Q3 beat and Q4 guide. Xilinx has to generate more than double current profits to not turn into a dilutive deal to long-term targets. AMD earnings were predicted to surge to $4.50 per share on a standalone basis with only 30% market share of the previous TAM.CEO Lisa Su has produced incredible results since taking over AMD back in 2014. The CEO deserves the benefit of the doubt for shareholders to follow the vision on acquiring Xilinx to become a leader in advanced computing.The key investor takeaway is that AMD delivers on an accretive deal that offers an enormous TAM for a company with combined 2021 revenue targets of only $14.4 billion before the blowout Q3 numbers. The tricky part is whether CEO Lisa Su can grow the revenue base of Xilinx beyond the 10% growth rates targeted for the next couple of years.The disappointment here is that AMD would've surged on these results and easily top $90 and approach $100. The stock could easily struggle while the deal is in the works, but more strong numbers from the combined entity will push the stock to previous targets anyway."
4379070,48311,2020-10-14T15:27:00-04:00,"Learning of a potential bid from AMD for Xilinx I struggled to form a confident opinion.It looked interesting to me and I established a small position.Later I reached out to Philip Freidin, a true expert in semiconductors, AMD and especially Xilinx.He's been so generous to let me interview him about the technological merits of the deal.It was a great pleasure and I've learned an incredible amount about semis but also cemented a newfound appreciation for Xilinx and its unique business model in semiconductors.","When I first learned AMD (AMD) was rumored to consider acquiring Xilinx (XLNX) I struggled to understand the rationale behind it. The products looked quite different. Xilinx is the leader in a unique type of chip called FPGA. Intel (INTC) made a similar acquisition in Altera years ago. Supposedly Intel wanted to combine its CPUs with the Altera FPGAs. But that hasn't exactly been a raving success. What's AMD's CEO Lisa Su's angle here? What are the odds of a competing offer? Does Xilinx hold a critical piece of technology or can that be acquired elsewhere? I didn't have the answers to those questions.Usually, it goes a long way if I put in the hours and read up. But semis aren't just any subject. It's a complicated field where even seasoned execs can make an ill-fated bet putting their company well behind the competition. I'm no stranger to hard-to-understand industries. I like biotech. But in the semis the different technologies are not just complex, they interact with each other. And that can actually yield a breakthrough combination.That's why I asked Philip Freidin if he'd be willing to be interviewed by me for Seeking Alpha. Philip has been for 10 years both at AMD and Xilinx which is perfect given the backdrop of this potential merger. After that, he consulted for 10 more to various semiconductor companies from small to big.At both AMD and Xilinx, he's held a product planning role. Product planning is the ongoing process of identifying and articulating market requirements that define a product's feature set. To do that well in semiconductors you need to talk to end users and try and predict what their needs are going to be three to four years down the line. Then you have to translate that into product development ""bets"" that are likely to work for your company.I couldn't be more thrilled to have been able to interview Philip on this subject. We ended up talking for hours in a wide-ranging conversation.This is actually a three-part-interview. I assume you have seen the first which you can find here. In that video we cover the basics of FPGAs. The second part is here.Later Philip talks about Xilinx and its strategy to become the leader in the space. Why Altera is a competitor to respect, while others are quite far behind for now.As were others, he's surprised at the rumor of AMD interest.He isn't immediately convinced it makes a lot of sense. There could be some angles to a combination that he all touches on. In these areas, the companies could potentially benefit from a combination. But overall, he's not sure why AMD wouldn't go for a licensing deal, with limited rights, in those specific areas.We also get into Xilinx's latest technological advancement, the Versal ACAP, and whether that's a game changer for Xilinx. We also get into whether FPGAs can be combined with CPUs on one die.Higher-performance SoCs are very important to AMD and Philip speculates that the company could be interested in Xilinx's latest iteration of its silicon interposer technology which could help AMD's 2.5D packaging.In this final part, Philip is kind enough to answer several reader questions.Because it runs very long I'll release the full interview in three installments. These take time to edit, get ready, upload and go through the editorial process.Enjoy it when you have time to enjoy long-form content and contemplate the next paradigm shift.I know these long-form interviews are not for everyone. If you do enjoy these interviews please like, subscribe, share the video. It makes all the difference to our guests, knowing people are interested to hear from them, learn from them and can be inspired by them.Philip will look at the comments, so give him a shoutout, and if you have a question for him that I didn't get to or didn't ask, throw it out there.Part 1Part 2"
4380055,42661,2020-10-20T15:28:10-04:00,"Rumors have been widespread since 10/8/20 of a deal pending for AMD to acquire Xilinx in a $30 billion deal.The rumors are countered by several analysts that argue it is not a good fit. Overall, a simple market buy is a crap-shoot at this time.I present a strategy to produce asymmetric high yield coupled with double-digit downside market protection, all bundled in a short-term 60-day exposure to market risks.","Trading stocks on rumors can be a real crap-shoot. With pundits talking about Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) close to a deal to buy Xilinx (XLNX), and others speculating on Nvidia (NVDA) being a better fit, I prefer a strategy that will provide a 24.82% annualized yield rate on a net $100.95 investment tied up for 59 days while providing 13.26% downside protection from the current $116.38 market price.Benzinga first reported a bullish pattern of unusual option trading activity in XLNX on October 2nd. On 10/8/20, The Wall Street Journal reported a deal was near for AMD to buy XLNX in a deal valued at $30 billion. Benzinga and many others picked up and spread the story the following day. That same day, Barron's responded with reports of doubts, citing Citigroup's Christopher Danely, New Street Research analyst Pierre Ferragu, and Truist's William Stein, all of whom discussed reasons the deal would be a bad fit. Cascend Research opined that Nvidia would be a better fit. Xilinx declined comment, citing policy not to comment on rumors, and AMD did not respond to queries.You will find abundant discussion and analysis of these rumors in the material linked above and on Seeking Alpha's XLNX ticker page. With this abundant coverage, I need not discuss those details here.At this time, Street talk has quieted but shares remain at the elevated level they popped to upon the first rumor reports. The 9 weeks prior to that, shares were consolidating around the $105 level after a long recovery from the virus bear market.The open question now is how to profit from the rumors without joining a simple crap-shoot. Covered option writing of cash secured puts currently are priced to provide a high annualized yield rate with downside market protection below the ore-rumor price consolidation in the $105 levels, all while limiting market risk exposure to a short-term 59 days. Consider writing (selling) the cash secured puts for the 59-day 12/18/20 $105.00 strike price at a premium of $4.05. This gives a net break-even point at $100.95. Downside protection is then $15.43 (13.26%) below current market price of $116.38, at a point on the low side of the consolidation range prior to the elevated prices driven by the current rumors. This converts a risky speculative hunch into a well balanced trade with asymmetric upside from the option premium. Longer-term contracts can be used to lock in greater option premium cash but trading off longer time exposure to market risk if these fading rumors should lead to prices sagging back to the prior trading range.Thank you for taking the time to read my work.

4381666,48311,2020-10-27T12:32:35-04:00,The annualized expected return on the AMD/Xilinx deal looks like it will be around 8%.I don't love that return although the deal looks like it could be on the safer side for a semi deal.I wouldn't mind having a position especially as it's one that's easy to hedge.Overall I'm inclined to believe there's going to be a better opportunity down the road.,"Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is acquiring chipmaker Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ:XLNX). I reviewed the deal rumors a few weeks ago and they seemed highly credible to me. At that time, I said I didn't think a 20% premium would cut it. AMD would likely need to top Xilinx's 12-month high. It's now topping its 12-month high and if AMD's stock holds up (which it looks like) then the deal will also exceed Xilinx's highest traded price in '19.As expected and flagged in my pre-market note, AMD shifted from being down pre-market/pre-call to up post-call.I've been listening in on the pre-market call and not surprised it is very well-received. Both executives seem very excited about the deal and are very positive about the future together and genuinely seem happy it is coming together.As I'm finishing this write-up, things have turned around again and on the market opening or slightly before AMD started selling off.Importantly, AMD's CEO Lisa Su sees growth for the flexible FPGAs in the future, and believes the 20% CAGR will still be attained by the combined company. Meanwhile, the deal is accretive on EPS and FCF per share. If AMD can keep up that combined CAGR, this is a sweet, sweet deal for the company. The deal is based on $300 million in synergies. Seems like a high number to me but we'll see.CEO Su goes as far as calling Xilinx the ideal match and emphasized that she isn't interested in M&A for M&A's sake and has historically not been interested in M&A. She believes this is a unique opportunity. She sees Xilinx as a technology leader, like AMD, in specific but important areas. She also notes Xilinx's deep strategic partnerships with a broad set of industry leaders. CEO Su also notes Xilinx's strong business model, long life cycle for the products and their technological benefits all of which industry specialist Philip Freidin (ex-AMD, ex-Xilinx) explained to me in three video interviews published here:What surprised me is Su noted a total addressable market of $30 billion for Xilinx. Currently, it is doing about $3 billion and I'd think it is likely that TAM should expand over time as well.Xilinx CEO Victor Peng also made a great impression and seemed genuinely very interested in the deal. At one point, he said he's all-in on the deal and highly motivated to make it integrate well.Faced with questions about the similar Intel (INTC) Alterra deal which is often referenced as a failure, both executives confidently argue this is completely different.Xilinx is the market leader. Market share continues to grow. Both companies execute really well. They emphasize businesses are complementary in terms of product and market segments. Emphasizing both companies are leading-edge technology users. Both partnered with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM). Both have modular designs. Xilinx is a leader in 2D and 3D die integration. And they mention there are a lot of synergies under the cover.Xilinx CEO Peng specifically mentions the combined company will be able to offer very powerful customer solutions. A nice underscore of how customer-focused Xilinx is to get its products that are ideal for flexibility into customer products.The deal is set to close at the end of 2021. I expect it will close sooner. The gross return looks to be around 8%. I've assumed Xilinx maintains its dividend. That return is okay.It is a hedged deal which makes it less vulnerable to market gyration. It can be invested in with some leverage and that will take the return up. I personally don't like it enough to invest in right now. There is a high probability we'll get a better entry point somewhere down the line. I've looked at the options market as well but I don't see an obvious opportunity to profit from this deal.It is possible I have the closing probability a bit too low. The executives appear really excited and driven to get this done. But to get to an annualized return that I love, I have to adjust the time to close and the closing probability and that really increases the risk of having these wrong and making what would be a bad bet in the long run. I'd be surprised if the spread significantly narrows in the short-term basis so I think it's fine to fade this for now.If you're a Xilinx holder, you're put in a tough spot because now you're essentially holding mostly AMD. If that were me, I'd probably hedge out the AMD stock (unless I already really liked AMD) and start researching AMD's prospects and its valuation.If I found myself in the deal pre-market (I closed it as the spread narrowed this much), I could have chosen to hold. I don't have to deal with long-term tax gains and that would be a consideration for me if I had to.The bottom line is that the market likes the deal so much, it isn't juicy enough that I want to be in there too."
4379036,48311,2020-10-14T11:34:52-04:00,Video interview with industry expert Philip Freidin.Philip worked at both AMD and Xilinx and made design choices based on estimates of future market fit.He's extremely knowledgeable about the products of companies and helped me understand the dynamics of a potential deal better.But much more importantly I gained new insights in the semiconductor industry and the beauty of the FPGA.This is the second installment of a three-part-interview.,Part 1 Part 3
4378727,63973,2020-10-12T17:52:34-04:00,"AMD's rumored acquisition of Xilinx is being made possible by a strong gain in AMD market capitalization over the last few years.The acquisition would make sense for Xilinx stockholders as the Company and stock have underperformed lately and could use a stimulus.While some investors see the takeout premium as small, the deal value is likely to be in the $30-$35B range and not much higher.","Rumors of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) acquiring Xilinx (XLNX) have started making rounds since Thursday. The terseness or absence of comments from AMD and Xilinx are more likely to be an indication of a deal in progress than the absence of one.It is an ironic turn of fate for Xilinx. During the early and mid-part of last decade, when AMD's valuation was closer to a couple of billion dollars, it was a potential acquisition target for Xilinx. Xilinx, which was valued over $10B at that time, had the reputation as an industry powerhouse whereas AMD's reputation was that of a weakling.About half a decade later, Xilinx, prior to the acquisition news leaking out, was valued at about $25B and AMD at $100B. In the recent past, including in the current calendar year, AMD has been growing rapidly. After a stellar 2019, AMD has guided for 32% growth this calendar year. Xilinx, on the other hand, had a low growth FY2020 and has been forecasting negative growth for FY2021 so far. In a market that rewards growth, it is clear why each company's stocks are performing as they are.(Source: Yahoo Finance)From a Xilinx stockholder perspective, the Company has underperformed and needs a growth vector. Management has bet on Datacenter as the key growth area. However, that may not be rewarding for the foreseeable future as datacenter barely constituted double digit percentage of the revenues in the most recent quarter (image below from Xilinx earnings presentation).Even superlative growth in datacenter segment will not drive much top line growth until that business area grows to be much larger.Wired and Wireless Group, or WWG, has been seen by investors as a potential growth area but that too has faced challenges - in large part due to the US government tariffs on Huawei and other Chinese companies. This dynamic could reverse if Democrats come in to power but that may not be a good bet given that Huawei future may have changed permanently and even Democrats may not significantly back off from current administration policies when it comes to China related issues.What the above implies is that Xilinx, on its current path, is headed for years of modest growth. An acquisition by a rapidly growing company like AMD may be strong positive for investors given the low internal growth prospects. By being a target of an acquisition, Xilinx shareholders will immediately get a pop in the stock price (some, or most, of which has already occurred since the rumor surfaced). Short-term shareholders can sell the pop if so desired. Longer-term shareholders may wait to see the deal details before making their move.Assuming an all stock, or mostly stock, deal - which seems likely given AMD does not have much cash on the balance sheet - investors need to decide if they want to convert their Xilinx shares into AMD shares. For investors contemplating the prospects, here is some food for thought:Xilinx management, due to its existing partnership with AMD on the datacenter front, likely has keen appreciation of AMD's growth prospects. If the management is not confident of AMD's prospects, they are unlikely to sell the Company to AMD - especially for a small ~20% premium which is being rumored.The small premium, especially if the deal goes down as a stock deal, suggests Xilinx management's confidence of a future as a part of AMD.Investors may wonder if the premium being rumored is too little. This is a legitimate question but given the weak prospects that Xilinx has shared recently, it is unclear if there is much upside to this number. However, a valuation closer to $35B, instead of the rumored $30B, would not surprise us."
4378378,48311,2020-10-09T13:33:01-04:00,"Chipmaker AMD is rumored to consider a deal for Xilinx.I'm inclined to believe the interest is quite genuine.Xilinx jumped 17% pre-market.I can't see AMD walking away from paying a 17% premium, but I can easily see a higher deal value.","The WSJ reports Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) to be in advanced talks to buy rival chipmaker Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ:XLNX). The WSJ has multiple sources that are in the know about this event. Because these are deal talks, it should be C-suite or advisors.The deal could be valued at more than $30 billion. That means it would take place at a surprisingly modest 20% premium. It's possible the stock gained about 5% before this rumor, but it doesn't look like it has already run up big time on speculation.Earlier talks stalled, but now it could get done as soon as next week. That would mean they get it done before the next earnings call.Xilinx is up 17% pre-market. A 17% pop on a rumor means the market views this as a very, very credible rumor and believes it makes sense. The WSJ article suggests AMD could use its soaring stock as currency. To be fair, it doesn't really have a choice.AMD has a market cap of about $100 billion. It has $1.7 billion in cash. It generates about $1.15 billion of EBITDA per annum. I don't see any other option but stock. AMD also has about $900 million in debt and is down about 4% pre-market.I don't think a 20% premium is going to cut it here. More likely AMD will need to go to $112 minimum, which is about Xilinx's 12-month high. But that will tank AMD's stock further.A Xilinx acquisition is accretive even if AMD offers quite a bit more. Which also means AMD could up the potential offer a bit. See Seeking Alpha data below:Xilinx generates much better margins; again see data below:Take my strategic analysis with a grain of salt. I'm not an industry expert by any means and just researched as deep as I've been able to pre-market. Xilinx is a leader in the field-programmable gate array niche. FPGAs can be reconfigured and reprogrammed. What that means is that once customers go with your products, they tend to stick to those. You're usually better off paying a little bit more for a product over having to retrain people or all kinds of built-up knowledge within your organization becoming obsolete. But Xilinx isn't showing a lot of growth over the past few years and that's why the market gave it a multiple that's a lot lower than AMD's:But Xilinx still commands a high multiple, and given its specialty, I wouldn't be surprised if sector specialists see this as an inflection point for FPGAs.I don't know enough about the semiconductor industry to have a good sense of what the synergy profiles look like here. I did look into the strategic rationale behind the Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Altera deal. Intel expected to be able to integrate FPGAs and processors on the same die (integrated circuit). That could double the performance, and Intel views that as important to perform server workloads. I think Intel is a bit more focused on servers, and it also expected the integrated chips to be strong enough to replace application-specific integrated circuits in autonomous driving, driver assistance and in industrial robots. Intel expected strong growth for the FPGAs in the server market.Both IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Advanced Micro Devices already partnered with Xilinx for their server processors.I'm inclined to believe it probably makes sense strategically. This merger could even make some other players nervous. One of the reasons for the deal to leak now could be to rouse competition. Either forcing AMD to tie it up fast or throw in something extra to get a sizeable break-up fee, but that's all speculation.Given the information I have available, I don't think AMD is going to walk away from this deal if it could get it done at a 20% premium. There seems to be a good strategic rationale given Intel made the same move. Maybe it is even necessary with Intel, after four years, seems to be making important progress with the integration of Xeon and FPGA.A 20% premium could be realistic if Xilinx would benefit tremendously from a combination as well. But in that case, it's probably not terrible to buy into Xilinx.At the pre-market price of $123, this seems like an interesting speculation on the deal becoming finalized. The problem is that you have about 17% downside risk that could materialize. But a ~20% premium is very low, especially if the combination offers competitive advantages. Which seems to be the case. With the added possibility that another party comes in and sets off a bidding war.Overall, I think there are enough interesting possibilities here. I entered a tiny long Xilinx position. I'm planning to increase or decrease it as I understand the deal better."
4378350,24361,2020-10-09T11:19:24-04:00,"The Wall Street Journal has reported that AMD is in ""advanced talks"" to acquire Xilinx for over $30 billion.Xilinx would offer attractive leverage to significant growth in markets like data center and 5G wireless, but the FPGA business is very different than what AMD knows.A bid in the $120's would be a fair price for Xilinx shareholders, though the exact structure of the deal (price, cash vs. equity) remains to be seen.","Maybe one of the surest signs that things are starting to get back to normal is the M&A cycle firing up again in the semiconductor space. It had been quiet for a while, but then there was the July bid from Analog (ADI) for Maxim (MXIM) and then September’s Nvidia (NVDA) bid for Arm Holdings. Now the Wall Street Journal reports that there may be another significant M&A deal in the works, with Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reportedly in “advanced talks” to acquire Xilinx (XLNX) for something north of $30 billion.I’ve liked Xilinx’s business for a while, and I see some significant growth opportunities for the company in areas like data center and 5G, with specific drivers like server acceleration, SmartNICs, antennae, and O-RAN. The immediate overlap with AMD is a little sketchy at first glance, and the businesses are very different (different product cycles, different customer bases, different development processes, et al), but Xilinx would definitely fit in with AMD’s desire to grow the data center business, and FPGA companies are scarce assets.Apart from the WSJ report late Thursday night, there really hasn’t been any specific rumors about a possible AMD-Xilinx deal. Xilinx’s name has come up in buyout chatter before, and that makes sense given its standalone position as the only buyable high-end FPGA asset, but seldom with specific details attached. The WSJ report suggests a buyout price “above $30 billion”, and Xilinx shares have since moved to a $30.2B enterprise value in pre-market trading as of this writing.How AMD would construct this deal (if there is a deal), remains to be seen. I don’t see much room for AMD offering a large cash component in a deal, as the company had a little under $2 billion in cash at the end of the quarter and it would likely be struggle to raise much more than another $10 billion or so. With AMD shares up 80% on a year-to-date basis, using equity as currency would be considerably more appealing for AMD, but I believe the price would likely have to be higher to get Xilinx shareholders to agree.Considering all of the above, AMD may offer XLNX shareholders a deal that gives them some degree of choice in the cash/equity mix (more AMD shares in exchange for a lower cash component) with boundaries on both components.Xilinx is one of the largest players in field-programmable gate arrays (or FPGAs), semiconductors that are configured by the customer after manufacture and can then be reprogrammed if and as needed. This is in contrast to application-specific integrated circuits (or ASICs) which are designed with specific functions. The “which is better?” question has a lot of nuances to it; ASICs are more expensive and time-consuming to design, but are cheaper to produce in volume and tend to be higher-performance in the field (as they’re optimized for a various specific task list). But if you need a chip quickly, need it to be flexible, and don’t need high volumes, FPGAs may well be the right choice.Like anything, there’s a high-end, low-end, and middle area for FPGA performance, and Xilinx and Intel’s (INTC) Altera dominate the high end in what is effectively a duopoly. For years the companies have traded leadership from node-to-node, but Xilinx has been introducing some interesting products like Zynq, which integrates a high-end microprocessor core.Xilinx generates about half of its revenue from the aerospace/defense, industrial, and test & measurement markets, with long-term growth drivers in areas like factory automation and machine vision. More than a third of revenue comes from communications, including switches, routers, basestations, and antennae. The data center business is still small (a little over 10% of revenue), but it’s growing very rapidly and Xilinx is leveraged to opportunities like server acceleration, edge computing, and interconnect.Xilinx has generated respectable long-term revenue growth over the last decade-plus (over 5%), though the company has always had (and always will have) to deal with FPGA-to-ASIC transitions that interrupt the growth trajectory. Gross margins are quite good (close to 70% on a non-GAAP basis), while non-GAAP operating margins have recently slipped from the 30% level into the high 20%’s on accelerated R&D spending – spending that I believe will be rewarded in the future with higher rates of growth.Between the opportunities in data center and 5G, I expect Xilinx’s revenue growth to accelerate into the double-digits for several years, with a forward revenue growth rate (around 8% to 9%) well ahead of the trailing growth rateAt $120 or higher, is AMD getting a good price for Xilinx? That really depends on how much you value growth and how well you think AMD management will do with a business that will be largely unfamiliar to them. The price would be well ahead of what Xilinx’s cash flows and/or margins would normally support, but it wouldn’t be out of line with what growth semiconductors often trade for in the market. Plus, you have to factor in the scarcity value/premium for a rare asset (a top-tier FPGA company).Given the differences in the business, including product development and product cycles, as well as the relatively low level of overlap, I think it would be a risky deal for AMD. I understand the attraction of the growth opportunities, particularly in the data center, but it’s a high price to pay.For Xilinx shareholders, this is a potentially a good opportunity to cash out at a respectable price. A key consideration will be the structure of the deal; given the multiples involved and the potential integration challenges, I wouldn’t be as excited to take AMD stock. I can’t say that Xilinx couldn’t have possibly outgrown the value of this bid (if there is an actual bid), but it provides a fair takeout price."
4378735,21597,2020-10-12T19:12:32-04:00,"The acquisition of Xilinx will add FPGAs to MPU and GPU sectors that AMD competes with Intel.AMD is after Xilinx' Versal ACAP solution, the next generation of technology moving AMD into 5G and Artificial Intelligence.Xilinx will see no benefit from the acquisition and won't accept the offer from AMD.","The Wall Street Journal reported on Oct. 8 that AMD (AMD) is in advanced talks to buy FPGA-maker Xilinx (XLNX) in a deal that could top $30 billion. Following the announcement there was the customary positives and negatives from sell-side analysts, as well as by authors on Seeking Alpha.In this article I will analyze the acquisition from the standpoint of market size, growth, and shares of the MPU (AMD) and FPGA (NASDAQ:XLNX) and the benefits to both companies. Looking forward to advanced technologies outside the MPU and FPGA sectors, I will focus on Xilinx' Versal ACAP solutions.The obvious question is why would AMD, which is gaining market share, want to acquire a company that has had a flat market share in its core FPGA business over the past six years? Let’s look at the numbers.Chart 1 shows market shares for AMD compared to Intel broken down by desktops, notebooks, and servers for the same period. AMD’s share in desktops is close to 15%, which is a result of the AMD's 32-core 3970X and 24-core 3960X Threadripper processors introduced in late 2019. They perform better for both video and 3D rendering than Intel's latest i9-10980X CPU.Chart 1Table 1 shows several important parameters. FPGA revenues are about 12% of MPU shares. However, the CAGR (compound annual growth rate) for FPGAs at 4.8% is less than MPU at 5.2%.But a key factor is Xilinx’ market share, which has been hovering around the 50% share for the past six years. Thus, CAGR is 0%. In contrast, AMD’s share of the overall MPU market is small, but increasing of late, as mentioned above.The third part of Table 1 is more telling. Multiplying market share by overall market gives revenues for the two companies. In this case, we can see that revenues for the two companies in the two markets are about the same. But AMD’s revenues have been increasing at a CAGR of 7.4% while Xilinx’ FPGA revenues have been increasing at a CAGR of just 4.8%.Another positive for AMD’s acquisition is the move by Xilinx to make devices at smaller dimensions. Doing so will increase the number of chips on a wafer, reduce cost, and increase performance of the chip.Xilinx calls its products manufactured at the 28nm, 20nm and 16nm nodes into a category named “Advanced Products” while all other products are included in a category named “Core Products.”Chart 2 shows that in 2014, just 24.7% of its FPGA revenues were Advanced Product. That percentage increased to 70.8% of revenues in 2019. Between 2014 and 2019, Advanced Products increased at a CAGR of 30.7% compared to -12.4% for Core Products.Chart 2Chart 3 shows that Xilinix held a 52% share of the FPGA market in 2019, ahead of Intel with a 35% share.Chart 3Xilinx has been working on its adaptive compute acceleration platform (ACAP) for several years. ACAP is the company’s name for its combination of ""adaptable hardware"" (programmable logic), scalar engines (CPUs), intelligent engines (AI or DSP accelerators) and hard IP blocks for connectivity and security. The company spent more than $1 billion and four years to develop the new chip.In early 2020, Xilinx released details of its Versal Premium series, offering three times the bandwidth and will enable double the compute density for accelerated workloads in the data center, when compared to Xilinx’ previous generation of FPGAs.These compute functions are mixed in different ratios and magnitudes to form the Versal portfolio of devices, as shown in Table 2.Versal Prime family has a broad range of target markets, while the Versal AI Core range is designed specifically for AI acceleration. Versal AI Edge and AI RF series with AI engines will follow in 2020, with the HBM series, which builds on Premium by taking advantage of high bandwidth memory technology, on the cards for 2021.The Versal ACAPs targeted markets are:With 5G implementation starting in earnest in 2020, Versal ACAP is being used at Samsung Electronics (OTC:SSNLF) to perform complex, real-time signal processing for 5G base stations. This includes sophisticated beamforming, especially in millimeter wave spectrum, an aspect of 5G in which Samsung has established some technology leadership.Samsung announced in a press release on April 16, 2020, that it will be using the Versal ACAP for worldwide 5G commercial deployments. Xilinx Versal ACAPs provide a universal, flexible and scalable platform that can address multiple operator requirements across multiple geographies.The increase in traffic and device connections in moving from 4G to 5G puts the core network under huge stress, with operators needing to provision for up to 100 times more traffic capacity within the same space and power constraints. Traditional CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs would not address that challenge alone, hence the need for combinations of different elements.It's claimed that AMD will make an offer to acquire Xilinx. In the core businesses, AMD has been gaining market share in recent years against Intel in a small growth MPU market (5.2% CAGR between 2013 and 2019).Xilinx has not shown growth in market share between 2013 and 2019 in its core FPGA market. small growth market (4.8% CAGR between 2013 and 2019).Clearly, the growth of the FPGA market would not warrant a $30 billion acquisition spend by AMD. Also, AMD competes against Intel in MPUs and GPUs. Another sector of competition against Intel in FPGAs with only a small margin of share difference, will stretch AMD financially.FPGAs will be replacing GPU AI accelerators at the datacenter and edge, but that market is currently small but with strong growth potential. Yet it also doesn’t warrant a $30 billion acquisition spend.The crown jewel for AMD is Xilinx’ Versal ACAP solution. The 7nm Versal ACAP product family represents Xilinx’s successor to the 16nm Virtex UltraScale+ FPGAs launched in 2015. Most importantly, Xilinx has regularly noted that the Versal ACAP solutions are to be considered a separate product category than FPGAs, reporting that ACAP goes far beyond the capabilities of an FPGA.The Versal ACAPs targeted markets are data center, wireless 5G communications, aerospace and defense radar, automotive driver assist (ADAS), and wired communications. These technologies represent the next generation in growth in the semiconductor markets, demanding significant performance increase and greater power efficiency.According to Xilinx, Versal ACAP is ideally suited to accelerate a broad set of applications in the emerging era of big data and artificial intelligence. These include: Video transcoding, database, data compression, search, AI inference, genomics, machine vision, computational storage and network acceleration. Software and hardware developers will be able to design ACAP-based products for end point, edge and cloud applications.Obviously Xilinx will be a profitable acquisition for AMD, hence the offer. But will Xilinix accept the offer? I say No."
4378935,48311,2020-10-13T17:31:00-04:00,"Analyzing the potential for AMD to acquire Xilinx I struggled understanding the rationale behind it because of deficient technological knowledge.I reached out to Philip Freidin who has been so generous to let me interview him at length about Xilinx, AMD, the cultures of the companies and FPGAs.By interviewing him I learned a tremendous amount about the possible rationales.Now appreciate how interesting FPGAs really are and better understand the Xilinx special business model.",Part 2 Part 3
4378359,103219,2020-10-09T12:20:26-04:00,AMD and XLNX might be tying the knot.The markets already have moved rapidly to adjust.We look at how this could be financed and the best way to hedge risks.,"The Wall Street Journal broke the news that Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) is negotiating to buy Xilinx (XLNX).Source: Wall Street Journal The Wall Street Journal has a very high accuracy on such reporting, and while the deal could fall apart, we have no doubt that one is being talked about today. The markets have rapidly moved to adjust as well.Source: Interactive BrokersWe look at the deal from three angles and suggest investors use this opportunity to hedge.Assuming the acquisition goes through both stocks would benefit. XLNX's Aerospace and Defense presence alongside its foothold in telecommunications would expand AMD's reach.Source: XLNXAMD on the other hand has stuck a sweet spot where it's finally delivering the revenue growth it promised for more than five years. The revenue chart actually looks like a ""Cup and Handle"" breakout.While XLNX has the ability to diversify AMD's revenue base, it has hit a rough spot and recent quarters showed revenue declines. This though is predominantly a pandemic impact and XLNX should be able to get back to a 7-10% revenue growth rate very quickly.Our verdict here is that the companies would likely be much stronger together with synergies in the data center division.The big issue for investors is that both stocks are trading at extremely expensive multiples. AMD is trading at over 13X revenues while XLNX is bordering on 10X.These are not points from which investors have made money in general multiple years out. XLNX makes a great example of that. It traded over 10X revenues on three occasions in the past.What were the returns?If you bought at about 10X revenues you broke even after 16, 14 and 11 years, respectively.Paying those revenue multiples can seem fun in the short term, and 1999 stands out as a stellar example of the ""madness of crowds,"" but longer term returns will be abysmal. Even if you ignore revenue multiples (which you should never do) both stocks are trading at over 45X earnings. Multiples that again suggest caution for a longer term outlook.Nvidia's (NVDA) foray into the M&A world by agreeing to acquire privately-held ARM Holdings from Softbank (OTCPK:SFTBY) is likely to get a very long and thorough review from antitrust authorities in many countries. XLNX and AMD will likely have almost none of these issues due to both their individual sizes and lack of domination of their sectors. ARM Holdings' patents also are likely to be a very interesting issue for regulatory authorities to resolve and again AMD and XLNX will bypass that threat.Before we get how to play the stocks, we want to bring one thing to your attention. AMD recently (less than one month back) got a big boost to its credit rating.Source: MarketwatchAt last check S&P still had AMD at a ""junk"" rating but was scheduled to review for an upgrade soon. With these developments in play, expect very little in the way of cash from AMD. This will be an all-stock or a predominantly ""all-stock"" deal. What this means is that beyond a point, the more AMD tries to pay for XLNX, the lower its own stock will go, offsetting benefits for XLNX shareholders.We are leaving our personal bearish thoughts aside, but the best thing for AMD shareholders would be to hedge this outcome by selling near-term $100 calls. These calls would buffer downside in case AMD gets incredibly enthusiastic in how much it agrees to pay. Source: Interactive BrokersIn the case of XLNX, we would go closer to the money and consider selling the $125 calls. If the acquisition does not go through, you could offset half the share price gains you see today via the call option.Source: Interactive BrokersWe could see AMD bid as high as $145 for XLNX, but when paid in AMD shares (which have dropped and will drop more), the value would be substantially lesser. The key risk in this action is if another white knight emerges and tries to get XLNX. Investors worried about this outcome could sell further out of the money call options.AMD and XLNX's marriage will likely benefit both companies and allow them to compete better against rivals like Intel (INTC). That said, the revenue multiples today are only justified though if you believe that this time is really, really different. Extremely high implied volatility should be used to the investors' advantage. As we have recently shown, this is the single best method to keep returns the same while decreasing risk."
4379555,105556,2020-10-17T10:23:28-04:00,"AMD rumored to acquire Xilinx for $30B, following on the heels of Nvidia acquiring Arm.In my Nvidia-Arm analysis, I remarked Nvidia is imitating Intel to at least some degree, with the reverse also being true.A Xilinx acquisition by AMD would imitate Intel’s 2015 Altera acquisition. Potential synergies include AI, DPU and 5G. Data center is also a small, but growing segment.AMD's data center group is currently led by the former VP of Intel's Programmable Solutions Group.I called Nvidia-Intel the 'semi battle of the decade'. It seems AMD does not want to be left behind.","On the heels of Nvidia (NVDA) acquiring Arm, reports have emerged that Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) would be close to acquiring Xilinx (XLNX) for $30B. The acquisition would be highly reminiscent of Intel's (INTC) acquisition of Altera in 2015.Looking at the FPGA market itself, it seems a mixed bag. Both Intel and Xilinx have seen mixed results in recent years. While leading products such as Stratix and Versal are likely growth drivers, uptake of FPGAs in the data center and for AI likely remains relatively minor. Nevertheless, the promise of the democratization of FPGAs persists for both companies.Looking at it from a broader view, competition between Intel and Nvidia has been intensifying as the future of compute becomes more heterogenous. Acquisitions such as Mellanox, Altera and Arm also indicate consolidation in the industry. Nvidia shifting to CPUs and Intel developing a GPU stack further indicates imitation in the industry as many of the leading silicon providers pursue the same markets to drive further growth.So, with AMD's strengthened position in recent years, it seems it does not want to be left behind. In terms of execution, AMD's data center group is led by the former leader of Intel's FPGA group.AMD's and Nvidia's market valuations are both indicative of high expectations to continue their growth, so such acquisitions seem in line with expectations in the market.Towards the middle of last decade when smartphones were maturing, the industry was sort of facing the question of what would come next. Much of what was heard around that time was about the emergence of IoT, with the expectation of 50 billion devices by 2020, for example smart watches. While, indeed, there have been many investments and growth in IoT, there has been no such explosion (yet). Instead, the biggest driver of demand became the data center and cloud, and that was were Intel shifted its resources primarily towards, in conjunction with the emergence of AI (while also growing its IoT business at a steady clip, to be sure).But before AI fueled billions in additional silicon demand, there had been expectations of FPGAs becoming much more predominant in the data center, with some estimates of 30% uptake by 2020. With so many 'threats' of third-party silicon potentially cannibalizing CPU demand in the data center, Intel eventually would invest in the whole portfolio of heterogenous compute.While FPGAs didn’t quite pan out (yet), since GPUs were much more apt for AI training than CPUs given their inherently more parallel nature, Nvidia did emerge as a new player in the data center. To further bolster its presence as a strong, and potentially independent end-to-end data center provider, Nvidia further acquired Mellanox and recently Arm.So, in recent analysis of this acquisition, I remarked that Nvidia seemed to be imitating Intel more than Intel was imitating Nvidia, given its pivot towards CPUs: Nvidia Vs. Intel: The Semi Battle Of The Decade. To that end, I indicated that Nvidia still lacked memory and storage, so I suggested it might acquire Micron (MU) next. Adding FPGAs might have been another possibility, but it seems another company has other plans about that.Since my analysis of Nvidia vs. Intel omitted AMD, some mentioned AMD in the comments. This is perhaps justified given its increasingly more competitive position. AMD has been conquering the desktop enthusiast segment with no response from Intel, moved to TSMC 7nm well before Nvidia, and the expectations of the upcoming Big Navi are also quite high. AMD has also increasingly differentiated its investments for the data center, for example by developing the upcoming CNDA2 architecture.AMD’s elevated ambitions were also seen in several other points this year. Its long-term model clearly indicated that it wanted to increase its gross margins. This was recently seen in the price positioning of Zen 3. AMD argues it has a leading product proposition, and charges accordingly. No longer is AMD a budget CPU vendor. While outsiders will often talk about market share, AMD’s strategy is not to grow share necessarily at whatever cost, but to grow both top and bottom lines.Since many contend AMD has competitive products both in CPUs and GPUs, perhaps the real 'semi battle' would really be Nvidia vs. Intel vs. AMD of perhaps three almost equally competitive companies with a broad product portfolio.However, as I detailed, for example, in this article, AMD has been lacking in the 'product portfolio' aspect: AMD Is Not Half An Intel. In that regard, an acquisition might change that.The AI revolution has been entertaining because every silicon vendor deemed its silicon apt for AI workloads.There has also been another notable trend, 5G. With 5G comes the emergence of software-defined networking, which changes the role traditional CPUs as well as FPGAs play in the network.To that end, Xilinx has also been adapting, and calls its latest 7nm FPGAs not FPGAs, but ACAPs: adaptable compute platform. Xilinx is developing a range of 7nm Versal silicon with dedicated IP geared towards networking, AI, edge, etc.Nvidia recently announced its DPU roadmap, leveraging assets from Mellanox. Intel's answer seems to be its SmartNICs. As Intel describes:Since they are FPGA-based, AMD would be able to compete in this segment of the data center if it acquires Xilinx.The trends above are not new. They have been and are still unfolding. Early last decade or so, they were called 'More than Moore'. More recently, Intel (Raja Koduri) has called it the architecture era. While Moore’s Law is definitely not over, the industry has recognized the role that more specialized and heterogenous silicon can play: in fact, leveraging Moore’s Law to include dedicated IP for specific workloads (such as AI, vision, etc.). In most SoCs, the actual CPU cores only take up fraction of total silicon area.Simply put, competition is increasing, and so has consolidation. This has resulted in fewer players, but those want to play an increasingly end-to-end role as a silicon provider for their customers, whether in the data center or at the edge. I earlier pointed at Nvidia and Intel as the two giants that were increasingly competing against each other in CPUs, GPUs, data center, self-driving silicon, IoT, etc.By acquiring Xilinx, reminiscent of Intel’s Altera acquisition half a decade ago, AMD would make a point that it doesn’t intend to be left behind as just a CPU and GPU provider for desktops and consoles. Even more so, AMD by market share would actually be bigger than Intel in FPGAs.The general concerns about the FPGA market lately has been that despite all promises, they have not or do not seem to come to fruition.Altera’s revenue has been basically flat over the last half a decade. Xilinx has seen some growth, but also declines. While FPGAs are clearly growing in the data center, it is still a fairly small market. FPGAs are used in a variety of markets, but growth in one segment often seems to be offset by declines in others. (Most recently, Xilinx saw declines in wireless, despite the build-out of 5G, while Intel saw growth in that segment.)Summed up, while some reports may mention AI and the data center as applications for FPGAs, those still do not seem to be a major revenue driver for that market (yet), even though it may be a growing segment. For example, Intel had been vocal about plans for increased integration between the Altera FPGAs and its Xeon CPUs, but it seems to have largely shelved those plans, in favor of an interconnect approach via its CXL open standard.On the other hand, some have also remarked that just as AMD’s financial profile is improving, AMD would be taking on a lot of debt. Nevertheless, while one can disagree with the market, the market is valuing AMD at ~$100B despite revenue of less than $10B, so an acquisition would be in line with the general trends in semiconductors and likely the expectations of the market of AMD to be a third competitor against Intel and Nvidia.Lastly, something I haven't seen mentioned in most reporting, it might be noted that AMD already has some FPGA experience in-house, as its data center group (Server Business Unit) is led by former SVP of Intel's Programmable Solutions Group, Dan McNamara.Shortly before his transition to AMD, he had in fact been promoted to SVP of a newly created Network and Custom Logic Group:By acquiring Xilinx, AMD would be able to pursue a similar opportunity as Intel in the 5G network infrastructure segment, which it announced early this year it would enter.One piece often mentioned is software: CUDA, x86, Arm. To that end, AMD does not really have a software ecosystem of itself. For example, Intel management will most often use the term 'Intel Architecture' instead of x86. Intel has also been developing oneAPI as an open industry standard.Nevertheless, given the mention of oneAPI, the extent of software as a differentiator can nevertheless be questioned. For example, oneAPI recently received support for AMD GPUs. So, while oneAPI seems clearly positioned as Intel's alternative to CUDA, others might also benefit from this model.Xilinx’s leading position in FPGAs in any case takes away concerns about software on that side; both Intel and Xilinx have their own FPGA ecosystem.Synergies between CPUs and FPGAs in the data center arguably have not been fulfilled at anywhere near the pace once expected, for example by Intel likely. Nevertheless, the promise of the democratization of FPGAs through higher-level programming tools is still there. For example through Intel’s OpenVINO and oneAPI tools. Xilinx's ACAPs are also an indication of this.FPGAs can also be leveraged for AI workloads, which both Xilinx and Intel have been pursuing, via their ACAPs and Stratix 10 NX with AI Tensor Blocks, respectively. Furthermore, (even with the emergence of software-defined networking) wireless will likely also remain a core market for FPGAs, a segment that AMD this year announced it is also pursuing with its Epyc CPUs with Nokia.To date, AMD has been watching Intel and Nvidia both growing and acquiring companies to become more relevant in the data center and beyond, increasing their competition. With AMD this year laying out a long-term financial model for increased revenue and margins, and given its own increased investment in the data center and emergence as a more competitive company since its Zen CPUs, it seems AMD, too, is starting to look beyond the CPU and GPU to further growth opportunities.To that end, adding FPGAs would add a new computing platform to AMD's portfolio, with some synergies in AI, 5G and data center. Xilinx itself was already on a path to increase its relevance by defining the new 'ACAP' category as FPGAs with additional IP, connected by a network-on-chip (NoC).In a previous analysis, I characterized Nvidia and Intel as the semi battle of the decade, but it seems AMD does not want to be left behind. Recent trends such as increased pricing of its Zen 3 CPUs further indicate that AMD wants to receive its fair profits from the (competitive) silicon it sells.AMD, just like Nvidia, has received more-than-premium stock valuations, so these companies expanding their markets to continue their growth seems in line with expectations as well as industry trends in the last half a decade such as AI, 5G, edge/IoT, data center and consolidation.Concerning Intel, while FPGA leadership on technical aspects can be discussed, in terms of market share/revenue, Xilinx is still well above Intel, so this acquisition would definitely add to their multi-decade competitive history."
4372147,21702,2020-09-02T13:45:53-04:00,"Like all semiconductor companies, Xilinx had a tough quarter.But data center segment revenue was up sequentially and up over 100% yoy.Data center growth was lead by SmartNICs, but the relatively new ACAP (Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform) product could be a winner going forward.","Xilinx (XLNX) is the inventor of the field-programmable gate-array (""FPGA"") and programmable System-on-a-Chip (""SoC"") solutions. What these products have in common is that they are highly-flexible and programmable silicon chips that enable engineers to rapidly build prototypes, easily fix-bugs, and optimize functionality using a suite of advanced software tools. These products can be found across many industries - from consumer to cars to the cloud - but data centers appear to be Xilinx's biggest growth catalyst.Unsurprisingly, XLNX was negatively affected by COVID-19 during its Q1FY21 quarter (for the 3 months ending June 27, 2020):Source: Q1FY21 EPS ReportAs can be seen by the graphic above, EPS was down -42% sequentially and -60% yoy. However, the company was still able to deliver $0.38/share of net income and $230 million in free cash flow (32% of revenue). During the quarter, XLNX returned $146 million to stockholders through dividends ($0.38/share) and share repurchases totalling 0.7 million shares of common stock at an average price of $78.38. The stock closed today at $105.31.The interesting observation from the quarterly segment breakdown was that the Data Center Group (""DCG"") was the only segment showing growth both sequentially (+10%) and year-over-year (+104%):Source: Q1FY21 PresentationThe bad news is that DCG only represented 12% of overall revenue. The company's biggest segment, AIT, which composes the Aerospace & Defense/Industrial/Test, Measurement, Emulation businesses (45% of revenue) hung in there pretty well and was only down 2% yoy. But the Wired and Wireless segment (WWG), the second-largest segment with 32% of revenue, took a big hit and was down 33% yoy.From the Q1 conference call, the DCG group's growth was driven by its SmartNIC product (a network interface controller) and compute AI chips:Guidance was for Q2 revenue in the range of $730-780 million. The midpoint of that guidance - $755 million - would be up ~4% sequentially but down 9.4% yoy. Data center group sales are expected to be relatively flat from the record quarter in Q1 as ""customers digest SmartNIC deployments.""The company's relatively new Versal ACAP engine could be a positive growth catalyst going forward:Source: Versal ACAPACAP stands for Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform. This is a powerful high-end product. It is a flexible and software-programmable SoC compute platform that combines two ARM scalar processing engines, ""Adaptable Engines"", and ""Intelligent Engines"" to achieve dramatic performance improvements of up to 20x over today's fastest FPGA implementations. Xilinx says for some specific applications, the ACAP platform could achieve over 100X the performance over today's fastest CPU implementations. That level of performance makes the Versal ACAP ideal for Data Centers, wired networks, 5G wireless, and automotive driver assist applications.The two ARM cores are common and fairly well-known industry scalar compute engines. ACAP's key advantage is that the Adaptable Engines are composed of memory cells connected to Xilinx's next generation of fast programmable logic. These structures can be customized for a specific compute task and configured and interfaced to work in conjunction with the Intelligent Engines - which are typically very long instruction word (""VLIW"") and/or single instruction/multiple data (""SIMD"") processors that are connected to high bandwidth memory for excellent performance. This is an ideal architecture to implement - for example - a flexible and programmable vector engine for churning through large data sets. Xilinx says these systems can improve performance by 5-10X for machine learning and digital signal processing (""DSP"") applications.The ACAP chip comes with a variety of standard network interfaces that enable it to interface seamlessly to the larger system.The beauty of ACAP is that it can be configured and highly tuned to focus on a specific application, getting rid of any functionality that is not needed, would slow performance, and burn more power. For example: a specific application to crunch large data sets might need only a single ARM scalar processor and would likely want to optimize memory bandwidth to feed a single SIMD processor. As a result, the company has already developed a portfolio of implementations to focus on various core markets:Source: Versal ACAPLike many semiconductor companies (see my recent articles on Texas Instruments (TXN) and NXP Semiconductor (NXPI) here and here), Xilinx's Q1FY21 was significantly affected by the impact of COVID-19. Guidance for Q2 isn't that strong but could surprise on the upside. As a result, and combined with the stock's recent strong performance (the forward P/E=36 and the yield has dropped to only 1.5%), I rate the company a HOLD.Longer term, it will be interesting to see if Xilinx's customers adopt the new and powerful ACAP product line. The architecture of ACAP is well-thought-out, and the flexibility of enabling engineers to reprogram logic and functionality would be a boon to those developing new data center applications for crunching big data. It's a high-end product, so would likely be a big boost to the top and bottom lines. Pay attention to the conference calls for any adoption news on the ACAP platform.Source: Seeking Alpha Charting Tool"
4347201,104695,2020-05-13T14:18:32-04:00,"Xilinx is the market leader in the PLD market with a range of FPGAs and is undergoing a transition to offer more complex and integrated products.The company is developing ACAP, a highly complex computational platform to target the growing data center, AI and 5G markets.The company is presented with great opportunities ahead, however near-term challenges and strong competition make us believe that the company is trading at a fair price.","Xilinx, Inc. (XLNX) develops and manufactures a range of Programmable Logic Devices ('PLDs') including Field Programmable Gate Array ('FPGA'). The company commands around half of the total market share of the FPGA duopoly market. As computational power continues to increase, FPGAs have gained increasing popularity due to its configurability and ability to handle large data workloads. The uses of the IC will grow even more with the advent of cloud computing, AI inferencing and 5G networks requiring significant computational capabilities. To capture these areas of growth, Xilinx is adopting a 'data center first' strategy, targeting Intel with a series of acceleration products used by cloud vendors such as Amazon (AMZN), Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba (BABA) and Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY).Besides FPGAs, constant innovation with application-specific integrated circuits ('ASIC') may act as substitutes which offer power efficiency over FPGAs. To counter the growing threat, Xilinx is developing an Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform ('ACAP'), a computational platform which is a complex SoC that offers better performances while maintaining the configurability of an FPGA. The company plans to ramp up production in the future and has recently secured a partnership with Samsung in 5G deployment by utilizing ACAPs in 5G infrastructures.Within the FPGA market, Xilinx and Altera (owned by Intel (INTC)), hold a duopoly power, with a combined market share of 90%. Xilinx though, holds a larger share at 50%. Both players are battling out in an increasingly competitive market.To understand what FPGAs are, you would have to compare them with the classic microcontrollers. Microcontrollers such as CPUs and GPUs have fixed designs and are only programmed from a software standpoint, whereas with FPGAs, the user has complete control over the hardware, as the hardware is configurable, allowing for incredible customization in running any application. The chip consists of modifiable and configurable logic blocks, and computes data in a parallel manner, which allows it to process large amounts of data more efficiently than general processors.These chips also have a wide range of applications, in areas such as telecommunication base stations, image processing, artificial intelligence (AI), data center hardware acceleration, enterprise networking and automotive advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).About half of Xilinx's revenue exposure is in the industrial, aerospace and defense segment, servicing the government in complex military systems. Yet as part of its strategy to realign target markets, the company's product portfolio has evolved to target the growing adoption of AI inferencing in cloud and 5G markets. Its Alveo and UltraScale line of FPGAs saw the company's data center segment growing at a staggering 42% CAGR between FY17 to FY19.Underpinning this growth, is the rise of FPGA-as-a-Service. With the rapidly growing AI and machine learning applications based on cloud computing, adoption of Xilinx's products has been increasing in hyperscale data centers offering FPGA acceleration application rental services. Xilinx's main partner in this space is Amazon's AWS, its EC2 F1 instance provides cloud-based access to UltraScale+ FPGAs which offer 30x better workload acceleration performance than CPUs in applications such as genomics research, financial analysis, video processing, security and cryptography, and machine learning.Besides Amazon, Xilinx has also steadily extended its footprint in the Chinese data center market, with partnerships with China's BAT (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent), providing its products enabling partners to develop and sell access to FPGA applications. Interestingly, Huawei was also one of Xilinx's customers, however due to the ban placed by the Trump administration, the company may lose Huawei as an important customer, risking up to $1 bln in revenues.Both FPGAs and ASICs have been around for decades with many electronic products today relying on these technologies, though innovation and advances in technology of both chips had continued to fuel the debate between ASIC and FPGA. Achieving higher gate density and lower power consumption over the past years, ASICs are posing major competition for FPGAs.Compared to FPGAs, ASIC technology offers superior performances and power efficiency. Further, ASICs are much harder to reverse engineer. Its drawback, however, is that it is not configurable unlike FPGAs. This means that ASICs are built for specific applications, which generally require higher performance, smaller device footprint and lower power consumption including large volume production.To deal with increasing competition from Intel and ASIC producers, Xilinx is developing a new form of SoC FPGA called the Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform ('ACAP'). This chip is a highly integrated, multicore, heterogeneous compute platform which is configurable at both the software and hardware level. The chip is a combination of a programmable logic block, CPU, DSP accelerators and hard IP blocks all in a single platform. Its main advantage is that the platform is able to optimize all the architectures to adapt to data flows and compute patterns that emerge real time. It also offers the ability to reconfigure hardware to accelerate data workloads within milliseconds. This allows data center servers to become highly programmable and offers significant increases in performance enabling various applications in big data and AI areas such as video transcoding, genomics, advanced search and many other leading technologies.Another important area for ACAP is in 5G deployment. Recently, Xilinx has partnered with Samsung to utilize its Versal ACAP chips for next gen 5G base station equipment. According to Samsung (OTC:SSNLF), these chips will be used in real time DSP tasks such as beam forming, which allows multiple streams of data to be transmitted simultaneously to multiple connected devices on the same spectrum. With beam forming, 5G networks can handle a significant increase in capacity, but requires greater computational power to deliver low-latency connections, constraining the existing FPGAs in the market. We cannot undermine the importance of this strategic partnership in 5G for Xilinx, adding to its list of partners like Ericsson (OTCPK:ERIAF) and Nokia (NOK). Although COVID-19 has slowed the deployment of 5G, it still represents an incredible growth opportunity for the company.Leveraging its market leadership in FPGA, Xilinx has managed to generate strong positive free cash flow in the past 10 years with an average margin of 29.33%. The only year its free cash flow was negative was in 2012 because the company made large investments in marketable securities that year. We believe Xilinx will continue to generate positive free cash flow in the coming years with the opportunities in AI, data centers and 5G.In terms of valuation though, the company appears to be trading at a fair price. This takes into account various factors such as the growing competition from Intel, which aims to harness its processing, memory and FPGAs in its latest Agilex line-up for its data center customers such as Microsoft (MSFT), posing a threat to Xilinx's strategic transition. Additionally, the ban on Huawei is causing the company to lose an important customer in the Chinese market.Based on a discounted cash flow analysis with a terminal EV/EBITDA multiple of 13.10x (Semiconductor industry average) and a discount rate of 8.9% (company's WACC), while assuming 0% revenue growth for 2020 (accounting impact from COVID-19), our model shows all growth opportunities have been fully priced in.Overall, Xilinx's strategy to transition towards the cloud, AI and 5G applications has gathered pace with the launch of its Versal ACAP line. CEO Victor Peng has announced in its recent earnings call that production is expected to start towards the end of the year, ramping up in 2021. Its partnerships with the major cloud vendors and 5G infrastructure players underpin its efforts to extend its leadership in these segments.However, the near-term challenges including the slowdown in 5G deployment due to COVID-19 and the ban on Huawei have caused increased uncertainty in the near term. Additionally, competition from Intel appears to be strong underpinned with its acquisition of Altera, aiming to create an integrated solution to solidify its lead in server markets. Thus, we believe the company is fairly priced and rate Xilinx as a Hold with a price target of $88.55.Note: For more research and analysis of high-quality companies within the global semiconductor industry, please click the ""Follow"" icon at the top of this page."
4350060,77985,2020-05-26T11:02:25-04:00,"Xilinx's top and bottom line shrank in Q4, and the forecast calls for more of the same in Q1 FY2021.Trade restrictions continue to cause problems for Xilinx, and even more restrictions may be looming.End markets that had not been as affected by trade restrictions could face a bigger threat with the coronavirus.The combination of increased trade restrictions and a lingering coronavirus will likely extend the time needed for Xilinx to get back on track.","Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) put the finishing touches on another fiscal year when it posted its Q4 FY2020 earnings results. Although there were some gains made, FY2020 turned out to be a disappointing year as a whole. While the year got off to a good start, FY2020 did not go the way it was expected to. What led to this and why this is likely to remain the case for the time being will be covered next.Source: XilinxRevenue declined by 9% YoY to $756M in Q4, and non-GAAP net income fell by 20% to $193M. Q4 was essentially a repeat of what happened in Q3. Both quarters had to deal with a shrinking top and bottom line. On the other hand, Xilinx still managed to post a new record in terms of annual revenue. Revenue for all of FY2020 increased by 3% to $3.16B. Xilinx continues its recent trend of increasing its annual revenue in comparison to the year before. Such a pattern, if maintained, bodes well for the future of the company.However, a closer look reveals a worrisome trend. While Xilinx got off to a great start with Q1 in FY2020, momentum was lost in subsequent quarters, and the company has been struggling to get back on track. The company peaked in Q1 when quarterly revenue reached a record high of $850M, but top and bottom line growth has since reversed.The table below shows how the first half of the year contrasts with the second half of the year. A small consolation is the fact that the declines seen in Q4 were less than the ones in Q3, which may give some hope that the worst is behind us. Nevertheless, business at Xilinx is no longer as robust as it was earlier in the year.The numbers from Xilinx could be a reflection of the stocking up of extra inventories by Chinese companies in anticipation of U.S. sanctions. Recall that trade sanctions on China's Huawei were imposed in May 2019, something some had anticipated way beforehand. The pulling forward of future sales may have distorted quarterly results at Xilinx.Some companies may have added extra inventory, which artificially boosted demand in previous quarters before restrictions went into effect. Once this slowed down due to trade restrictions and other reasons, demand fell. A previous article goes into further detail as to its impact on Xilinx.The outlook calls for further declines. Xilinx is forecasting Q1 FY2021 revenue of $660-720M, a decrease of 19% YoY at the midpoint. The company also declined to provide full-year guidance because of all the uncertainty in the current environment.Xilinx provided more details as to the current outlook in the Q4 earnings call. Trade restrictions were a big reason why FY2020 turned out to be different than what Xilinx had hoped for. These factors impacted the company in ways that were not anticipated. Management explains in the Q4 earnings call that:A transcript of the Q4 FY2020 earnings call can be found using this link.The inability to conduct business as usual with certain Chinese companies affected revenues, as can be seen in the table below. Revenue from the Asia Pacific region declined substantially compared to a year ago. Asia Pacific made up 47% of revenue a year ago, but this percentage fell by 10 percentage points in Q4.According to the 2018 Form-10K, China contributed roughly a quarter of revenue in FY2018, the year before China and the U.S. initiated a trade war. It's therefore inevitable that a company like Xilinx will be negatively impacted if trade restrictions are imposed on a big part of your client base.The impact of not being able to conduct business as usual with Huawei, a leading supplier of telecommunications equipment, can also be seen in revenues from end markets. The ""Wired and Wireless Group"" was by far the worst performer in the table below. The WWG segment has fallen from 42% of revenue to just 24% in one year.However, it's not only trade restrictions Xilinx has to contend with. Another factor impacting Xilinx is the coronavirus outbreak. The need to combat the virus required drastic countermeasures, which greatly affected companies and the economies of many countries.The coronavirus is expected to continue to have an impact in the coming quarters, although to what extent is yet to be determined.On a more positive note, Xilinx remains optimistic about 5G and the impact it will have on the company.Much of the bull case for Xilinx rested on the assumption that the rollout of 5G networks would boost demand for FPGAs to be used in 5G infrastructure. The Huawei restrictions may have derailed Xilinx to a certain extent, but the road ahead looks mostly intact.Xilinx still believes that 5G will pay off, although the company may have to wait a while longer for the benefits to arrive.Source: Wikimedia CommonsXilinx experienced a reversal of fortunes in FY2020. The company headed into FY2020 with the expectations that it would stand to benefit from the global rollout of 5G networks. The quarterly results in late 2018 and early 2019 seemed to validate expectations that 5G would be a potent driver of growth at Xilinx. The stock was and is still considered a 5G play.But the coronavirus looks to be a major spoiler. 5G deployments are likely to face delays due to the need to combat the coronavirus outbreak. For instance, Nokia's CEO has stated that at least some European countries will have to delay their 5G rollout. Some carriers may have to cut back on capex spending due to a worsening economy, and that will impact suppliers to telecom equipment manufacturers like Xilinx.Some of the end markets that had previously held up relatively well in the past could face a bigger challenge with the coronavirus. How much depends on how well countries are able to contain the further spread of the virus. The one exception may be the Data Center Group at Xilinx. That segment could benefit from the coronavirus due to the need to do more online.In addition, Xilinx still has to deal with trade-related issues that have not gone away. If anything, trade restrictions could increase if we go by recent reports. It's possible that China will retaliate in ways that not everyone anticipates. Demand from China cannot be relied upon with the presence of trade restrictions by the U.S. government.The consequence of these trade restrictions is that a sizable portion of the addressable market has been lost for the time being, if not permanently. While Xilinx believes that the loss can be overcome, it will still take some time to make up for lost revenue. The exact timetable for a full recovery is not certain.Another unknown clouding the company's outlook is the degree to which Chinese companies pulled forward future sales due to the threat of U.S. sanctions. If Chinese companies build large inventories of semiconductor chips, recovery may take longer to materialize. Companies will need to use excess inventories before replenishing, which will temporarily reduce demand for new chips from suppliers like Xilinx. This article delves deeper into this issue.The coronavirus outbreak and trade restrictions are both issues that have yet to be settled. Xilinx will have to deal with both factors for the time being and the likely negative effects that they bring with them. Both could potentially lead to additional weakness at Xilinx that has yet to be accounted for at this point. For instance, it's assumed that a vaccine is only a matter of time. Once here, possibly as soon as the end of the year, it's expected that the economy will return to where it was before the outbreak. But those assumptions may not be correct. A vaccine may take longer to develop, and the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy could be much more severe than currently anticipated.Bottom line, trade restrictions were the initial catalyst that put Xilinx in the rough patch it finds itself in. These have not gone away, and could even become worse. If Xilinx was rated neutral previously due to trade sanctions and its effects, then the additional burden of the coronavirus and its consequences does not help Xilinx. Xilinx therefore stays at neutral."
4356411,69905,2020-06-30T13:48:03-04:00,Q1 2021 updated results points towards a strong improvement to its fundamentals.Its adjusted free cash flows are less strong than first meets the eye.More likely than not the stock is already close to fairly valued.,"Xilinx's (XLNX) updated Q1 2021 results guidance marks a rapid improvement to its underlying performance since management's previous guidance less than 70 days ago.Xilinx is a high quality, high-profit margin business, which pays out a small dividend. While digging into its cash flows, I question just how much of those cash flows are organic versus driven by M&A. On balance, the stock is probably close to fairly valued.Xilinx sells adaptive processing platforms. The industry typically uses fixed-function graphics processing units ('GPUs'), application-specific standard products ('ASSPs'), and custom application-specific integrated circuits ('ASICs'). Those chips are often at a lower cost but come with limited functionality.Conversely, Xilinx's chips are high performance and can be adapted for use after manufacturing. This technology puts it leaps and bounds above its peers. It's the adaptability of its chips which makes Xilinx compelling.Moving on, Xilinx is fairly cyclical as you can see below, including the updated guidance from yesterday:Source: Author's calculations; fiscal Q1 2021 Updated GuidanceConsequently, although Xilinx is fairly well-diversified with a large number of end markets, its exposure to the automotive sector and industrials are likely to continue to weigh on its results, at least in the interim.On the other hand, given that Xilinx's updated Q1 2020 guidance points towards a very strong improvement compared with their own previous guidance for Q1 2020 which previously pointed towards $660M-$720M, and now points to it beating even the high end of its previous guidance, this is very welcome news.However, realistically, I don't expect Xilinx to meaningfully return to open market repurchases anytime soon, despite the positive and unexpected improvement to its operations.For now, Xilinx is likely to continue to look towards shoring up its balance sheet and paying out its recently raised dividend - carrying a 1.7% yield.Investors rarely look at a company's balance sheet. Presently, investors obsess with revenue growth rate to exclusion of almost everything else.For instance, looking through Xilinx's balance sheet, we can see that goodwill and acquisition-related intangibles have jumped from the end of fiscal 2019 (calendar March 2019) from approximately $420 million to $820 million, over the previous twelve months.Indeed, we can see these intangibles have approximately doubled in a short twelve-month period, without anywhere near proportional increase in revenues.Readers' eyes are likely to glaze over this fact and deem this a non-cash entry to balance sheet and consider it immaterial.Before doing that, while I note that this is not a reason to break an investment thesis, this consistent M&A activity has large cash costs associated with it.Consider the table that follows:Source: Fiscal 2020 10-KYou should hopefully notice the very steady and increasing cash flow from operations highlighted in green. Xilinx's cash flows from operations go from $820 million in fiscal 2018 and increase into fiscal 2020 reaching just under $1.2 billion - a very strong increase, no doubt.However, this steady increase has been brought about by a rapidly increasing M&A activity. With the end result being that Xilinx's adjusted free cash flow is actually declining with the passage of time.Next, not a huge make or break case for the company, but management has no significant skin in the game, and no share purchases have been made by management over the past two years.Source: Proxy StatementArguably, the most attractive aspect of Xilinx is the combination of very high-profit margins and strong cash flow generation. While noting that its free cash flow is not increasing at a rapid clip, it still generates approximately $1 billion of free cash flow before its heavy M&A strategy.Saying that paying approximately $22 billion market cap for Xilinx appears to leave investors with an insufficient margin of safety. Particularly, given that its growth rates remain largely negative.Furthermore, it appears to be some time before it will be lapping the easy comps from this year. How long until Xilinx is reporting double-digit revenue growth rates?Asides from pointing out that valuation is a meaningful concern here, we must bear in mind that Xilinx's industry is very cyclical. Even though Wall Street is pricing stocks as if the global economic contraction is irrelevant, this period of unchecked optimism is just as likely to be met with a substantial and equal measure of pessimism once companies start to report their results in the upcoming few weeks, and guidance from companies get pulled.The semi sector is very much exposed to economic cycles, and price erosion is a rapid and frequent occurrence, that would materially affect Xilinx. This is worthwhile bearing in mind.A substantial aspect of the bullish thesis is contingent on Xilinx's very high-profit margins, which are heavily dependent on Xilinx's yield improvement to offset pricing erosion as its products mature. Saying that, so far Xilinx has been successful here, and it may continue to be so.Xilinx is not overly expensively valued given that we note that it does generate strong free cash flow. What's more, as discussed throughout its a high-quality business, with an increasing dividend - albeit with a small yield.Ultimately, its underlying performance is fairly volatile, and even though its Q1 2020 is a strong improvement from earlier expectations, this company's near-term prospects remain heavily influenced by the macroeconomic factors that are substantially outside of its control and possibly the downside is still not fully priced here."
4320952,104941,2020-02-03T11:04:55-05:00,"Xilinx's valuation has been decimated following their recent earnings report.The gloomy consensus surrounding the stock at present creates a seemingly attractive entry point, but further investigation reveals we need a steeper discount.Notwithstanding, Xilinx continues to capitalize on the growth of 5G, artificial intelligence, and a host of other secular tech trends requiring their programmable chips.","Source: Unmanned Systems TechnologyXilinx (XLNX) designs and sources production of semiconductors known as FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Array). The stock fits within my basket of ""the new oil stocks,"" all of which have replaced my oil and gas holdings (save for Energy Transfer (ET)). These holdings include Qualcomm (QCOM), Broadcom (AVGO), Nvidia (NVDA), XLNX, and Skyworks Solutions (SWKS).While the name FPGA seems complex, the product is actually quite simple. In essence, Xilinx creates chips that can be programmed to perform whatever function the end user desires.Xilinx chips are unique because they are considered ""programmable."" In that, most chips are programmed at the time of production, and when their programming reaches obsolescence, these chips must be totally replaced. In contrast, Xilinx's programmable chips enable extended lifecycles, as instead of completely replacing obsolete chip tech, Xilinx's chips can simply be reprogrammed. Here's an example from a website called prowesscorp.com:Xilinx chips differ from a few of the most prominent chip designs in that, CPUs, GPUs, and ASICs cannot be reconfigured after manufacturing, whereas Xilinx chips can. However, with that capability for reprogramming comes sacrifices in other chip attributes, such as cost effectiveness for mass production and efficient power usage.While Xilinx's chips offer a fast, convenient solution for low-volume applications, they suffer when it comes to mass volume production, which is where CPUs, ASICs, and GPUs shine.Shares of Xilinx exploded in early 2019 to the upside due to increased demand for their chips in light of certain secular growth trends in technology. These trends include:Xilinx has been laser-focused on adapting to these secular growth trends, such as cloud computing and 5G infrastructure build, as evidenced by their new products, which can be found here. But does the stock offer compelling value? Let's explore!Today, I'm rolling out my valuation model in its entirety. This model is based in reality, and objectively assesses cash flows that equity holders (aka shareholders) receive. My valuation model consists of three steps:Now that may seem like a good bit of information to digest, but it's actually incredibly simple and useful for grounding our valuations in reality.So let's apply it to Xilinx!Discounted Cash Flow ModelSource: Data compiled from YChartsAssumptions: Over the last ten years, Xilinx has grown their FCF to equity at an annualized rate of 9.94%. Therefore, in light of the secular growth trends bolstering the company's business, I project that they will continue this conservative growth for the next 10 years.Okay, so at our current share price of about $85, buying Xilinx today would technically result in your beating the market over the next 10 years, granted the market's annualized return matches that of its first 90 years (9.8% annualized). This is so because the cash flows you'd receive over the next 10 years would be slightly higher than those yielded by 9.8% growth from SPY.But that's only step 1 and does not fully illustrate the whole picture, especially since we often will not actually receive those cash flows as shareholders!Discounted Cash Flow Including Effects Of BuybacksSource: Data compiled from YChartsIn the above model, you can see that in this case, we accounted for the effect of a 9.14% reduction in share count, which was what Xilinx was able to execute from 2010-2019.Source: YChartsThis increased the rate at which our free cash flow per share grew each year, resulting in an annualized growth rate of 11%, instead of 9.94%. Gotta love buybacks!Alright, onto the last step:At the fair value of $93.67, we implicitly assume that once the 10 years have concluded, growth prospects will precipitously decline or nearly evaporate. While this may be a prudent way to invest, it also completely eschews my fundamental principle of buying fantastic companies at better prices and holding them for a lifetime.So let's normalize for post-10y growth.Source: Data compiled from YChartsSo at the end of the 3-step modeling process, we arrive at a price target of $193.12 by 2030, which implies a CAGR of 8.55% over the next 10 years.While I believe Xilinx will continue to generate solid free cash flow growth, the current valuation does not portend market-beating returns, nor does it provide a margin of safety sufficient to risk investor capital at the present share price.Risks (Vis-a-vis the viability of Xilinx's entire business)The primary risk that revolves around Xilinx, and chip stocks in general, is that their CEO won't overcome ""The Innovator's Dilemma."" That is, will Xilinx's CEO be able to direct the development of the next technology today, for which the company won't be well-compensated, so as to ensure that tomorrow Xilinx's technology will dominate the intelligent chip landscape? One cannot be entirely sure.In light of this dilemma, which all companies face in some form or fashion, we must diversify, hence I shared with you my list of chip stock holdings in one of the above paragraphs.My buy price would be somewhere around $50. Does that mean I think Xilinx is a terrible company to own at their current price? Certainly not. The company may surprise to the upside with the advent of more technologies that use their FPGAs.But based on their 10-year trends, for which we have robust data, the likelihood that Xilinx meaningfully outperforms the market over the next 10 years is relatively slim at today's price.And I want to be abundantly clear about my projection: I think Xilinx is a great investment to buy; however, my goal is always to meaningfully outperform the 9.8% benchmark on an annualized basis. Adding new capital to Xilinx today would not achieve my goal of doing so.With that being said, I'm holding my long position in Xilinx as a part of my basket of chip stocks and plan to continue holding it.Thanks for reading and happy investing!"
4340427,24361,2020-04-28T04:27:40-04:00,"Xilinx's fiscal fourth quarter beat a lowered bar, with some more notable outperformance on the margin lines.Markets like auto, commercial aero, and general industrial are likely to be substantially weaker in Q2, and the wireless business has shrunk by more than half on increased ASIC substitution.The company has weathered big swings between bullishness and bearishness before, but management needs to rebuild confidence in long-term drivers like 5G wireless and data center.Shares aren't really ""cheap"" yet, but they're trading at a much more reasonable valuation than they historically have, and they're worth watching as a sentiment reversal opportunity.","When I last wrote on Xilinx (XLNX), I didn’t see a particularly attractive opportunity in the shares, but I also didn’t expect the roughly 50% underperformance relative to the SOX index that was to come. Xilinx has made a credible case for attractive long-term growth opportunities in markets like data centers and from expanded product platform opportunities like Zynq, but the company has also seen a much faster-than-expected erosion of its 5G opportunity from ASIC vendors like Marvell Technology Group (MRVL).The shares have already enjoyed a good bounce from their March panic lows and do still seem to have some upside relative to discounted cash flow, or at least more than has typically been available. Management needs to rebuild the enthusiasm that investors once had for FPGAs in general, and that is likely to take some time, but won’t be helped by the challenges created by the COVID-19 outbreak. Although I see some opportunity here, there are names I like better on a risk-adjusted basis.The sell side has been scaling down its expectations for Xilinx for some time, driven in large part by disappointments in the Wired & Wireless business, and against that lowered bar, Xilinx did post a better-than-expected fiscal fourth quarter (calendar first quarter).Revenue declined 9% yoy and rose 4.5% on a qoq basis, beating expectations by about 1% and coming in just above the low end of the prior guidance range. Gross margin improved more than three points yoy and close to three points qoq, with Xilinx delivering one of its better quarterly results on a long-term basis. Operating income declined 16% and rose 25% qoq, with operating margin declining a little more than two points yoy and improving almost five points sequentially.Relative to expectations, gross margin beat by 150bp, while operating margin beat by about three and a half points on reduced hiring and better control of discretionary spending.By unit, the AIT segment saw 23% yoy and 30% qoq growth, beating expectations by more than 4%. Aero & Defense was quite healthy (up 23% yoy and 16% qoq), while Industrial held up (down 2% yoy, up 10% qoq) and TME was up strong (up 16% yoy and 79% qoq). Wired and Wireless was weak, down 46% yoy and 19% qoq, but still 4% better than expected on stronger optical transport sales (Wired revenue rose 4% qoq) and some strength in radio shipments. ABC revenue rose 2% yoy and fell 13% qoq, missing by 13%, with a modest decline in Auto (down 1% qoq) and 20%-plus declines in both Broadcast and Consumer. Data Center revenue rose 77% yoy and 14% qoq on ongoing growth in areas like SmartNIC, and sales beat expectations by almost 3%.Full-year guidance is relatively rare now among chip companies, so the greater forecasting uncertainties created by COVID-19 don’t factor quite as much into guidance here as they do for other sectors. Still, Xilinx guided to a 9% qoq decline in revenue (at the midpoint) for the next quarter, a roughly 5% downward guide relative to the prior sell-side average. Not enough chip companies have reported yet to really dial in that guidance revision, but Texas Instruments (TXN) guided 9% below the prior sell-side average, while STMicroelectronics (STM) and Intel (INTC) guided higher relative to lowered expectations.Xilinx management said they saw pronounced weakness starting in mid-March, particularly in autos. Based on what’s going on in the end-markets, the next quarter should be pretty ugly for markets like auto, general industrial, consumer and aerospace, but defense and data center should hold up comparatively better. Looking out a few quarters, I would expect auto to recover a little faster than most other markets, but I believe commercial aerospace could be weaker for longer.A more relevant unknown is the prospects for the Wired and Wireless group in the coming quarters and years. I’m fairly bullish on optical networking deployments, which will help Wired, but that isn’t what most analysts care about. In the Wireless business, Xilinx has seen brutal revenue erosion (down more than 50% year over year), as ASICs have replaced FPGAs sooner than expected in baseband and the company’s business with Huawei has largely gone away.Looking ahead, there are risks of losing more business in areas like 5G radio, though management is still bullish on its opportunities in massive MIMO antennae and recently announced a win at Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) with its Versal ACAP “radio on a chip” solution. Management has been pretty consistent over the last few months that they still believe that the 5G opportunity will eventually be 3x to 4x larger than the opportunity in 4G was, but the faster pace of ASIC substitution has clearly rattled the Street (and that’s a reasonable reaction, at least to a point).There are also still some attractive longer-term opportunities. Growth in Zynq once again outgrew overall company revenue performance (up 2%, to 20% of revenue), and management has been bullish on emerging opportunities in areas like data center and CVM.The Street has shifted to a “show me” attitude on many of Xilinx’s growth opportunities. I won’t say that that is unfair given recent performance, nor is it historically unprecedented, but I will say that sentiment usually comes around again and there are still attractive, credible long-term opportunities for not only FPGAs, but also expanded offerings like Zynq (FPGAs integrated with high-performance microprocessor cores).I’m expecting revenue to accelerate meaningfully from FY2021, growing at a mid-teens rate through FY’25, so clearly I believe this is a “show me” story that will, in fact, show some results. Longer term, I expect revenue to decelerate but still grow at a long-term rate in the high single digits. I’m less aggressive now on margin/FCF margin expansion opportunities. I expect operating margin will decline again in FY’21 (after declining in FY’20), and I think it will take a while to get back to 30%-plus margins.I don’t want to suggest Xilinx is significantly undervalued on a discounted cash flow basis, because I don’t believe it is, but this is a stock that has long been expensive or extremely expensive on that metric, so it is more of a relative call. It would seem that there’s a lot less “FPGA premium” in the share price now, and I think this is a name that’s worth closer monitoring, as I think the Street may have turned a little too far to the other side on the company’s long-term potential."

Not much was expected from Q3 since Xilinx had already issued weak guidance for the quarter. Nevertheless, the stock dropped after the earnings release since the company's outlook was worse than expected. However, Xilinx remains positive that Q3 will be the bottom with better times ahead. Why this may turn out to be too optimistic will be covered next in greater detail.Q3 was expected to be weak and double-digit declines in both revenue and net income are consistent with that. Revenue decreased by 10% YoY to $723M. GAAP net income dropped by 32% YoY to $162M. More weak results are expected and Xilinx lowered its outlook accordingly. Q4 guidance calls for revenue of $750-780M, a decline of 8% YoY at the midpoint. Since revenue for the first three quarters amounted to $2,406M, revenue for all of FY2020 is expected to be $3,156-3,186M.Source: XilinxManagement reiterated its previous call that Xilinx will recover in Q4 after hitting bottom in Q3. From the Q3 earnings call:A transcript of the Q3 FY2020 earnings call can be found here.So far, everything is more or less in line with expectations. But what came next was not. From the Q3 earnings call:In addition, Xilinx announced layoffs as a result of the headwinds confronting it.The change in outlook was driven primarily by the Wired and Wireless Group (WWG). The WWG segment was the weakest in Q3 with a decline of 18% YoY, more than anyone else.Source: Form 10-QFurthermore, it seems that the rollout of 5G is not going the way Xilinx expected it to.Xilinx also changed its stance on Huawei. The loss of revenue from Huawei is seen as having a more permanent character.Xilinx had in the past stated that Huawei would be hard-pressed to live without Xilinx. Other people apparently disagreed with this assessment and offered contrasting views. For instance, this article explores this topic in further detail.Xilinx now seems to be more open to the idea that its initial assessment of Huawei and what it's able to do may have been misplaced. Xilinx may not only have lost a major customer, but Huawei could cause other headwinds, especially as it relates to 5G. This article covers this issue in greater detail.The Q3 quarterly report makes it clear that the telecommunications sector is causing problems for Xilinx. According to CEO Victor Peng, a ""perfect storm"" led to things being the way they are. Most egregious to Xilinx has to be the ""slowdown in 5G rollout across multiple regions.""A stalled rollout is not what was expected from Xilinx. A big part of the bull case for Xilinx rests on the perception that the company stands to benefit from 5G as a supplier of essential components needed in 5G base stations and other infrastructure.The slowdown stands in sharp contrast to the Chinese market where local media reports claim rapid deployment of 5G. According to a recent article, China could add anywhere from 400,000 to 1,000,000 5G base stations in 2020 to extend its lead as the country with the largest 5G network. These two different accounts of how 5G is doing seems to suggest that Xilinx is missing out on the 5G rollout in China.Nevertheless, Xilinx expects market conditions to improve, if only at a slower pace. Q4 FY2020 is expected to show improvement with Q3, the low point. However, this assessment on the part of Xilinx may turn out to be too optimistic. It has been suggested that demand for products from Xilinx was artificially inflated in the months prior to the imposing of trade sanctions on companies from China in May 2019. This article elaborates on this issue.Remember that Q4 FY2019 was the last quarter before Chinese companies like Huawei were added to the Entity List in May 2019 and cut off from U.S. suppliers. That quarter may therefore have been the peak of China's buying spree. That could have an impact on Y-o-Y comps in Q4 FY2020. Some of the increased demand may now be fading with trade restrictions in place.Furthermore, there is reason to believe that this inventory building may have been going on for quite some time. In the tables below, we can see that Chinese imports of semiconductor chips were more or less stable in the four years up to 2016. From that year on, China increased its imports by as much as 37%. That number could have been higher if trade restrictions on China did not lower its chip imports in 2019.Source: China customs statisticsSource: SOIConsortium citing China customsSomething seems to have happened in 2016 that caused China's imports, which had been relatively stable, to jump in the last several years. It's probably no coincidence that 2016 also happens to be the year that Donald Trump got elected as President of the United States.President Trump's hard-line views on China predate his presidency. It's not inconceivable that Chinese companies started stocking up on inventories in anticipation of a possible dispute between the U.S. and China. This process accelerated in 2018 when the trade war started and signs emerged of an imminent ""tech war"" with companies like Huawei subject to trade restrictions.China may not be the only one to have built excess inventories. With one party controlling both the legislative and executive branches of the U.S. government, many companies anticipated that the 2017 tax cuts were not a matter of if but when. Companies were expected to increase their investments and spending with lower tax rates. Many increased their inventories as a result. Chip demand may have been pulled forward due to this.Source: XilinxFrom the table above, we can see that revenue at Xilinx jumped in FY2019 after staying flat for years. Note that FY2019 at Xilinx roughly corresponds with CY2018. The possibility arises that a big chunk of the revenue growth was not due to real demand, but inventory building. It's not clear which is which, but it's hard to see how the huge chip buying binge in China could not have affected Xilinx. According to the last available Form 10-K, China contributed $850M or 27.8% of $3059M in FY2019.If inventory building did play a major role, the implication is that Xilinx will have to go through a period of declining revenue. Companies will need time to reduce the inventories they have accumulated for whatever reason. Xilinx should expect sales to disappoint in the meantime. Depending on how much of the revenue increase was due to real demand or simply stocking up, Xilinx may not be anywhere close to hitting bottom.Source: Wikimedia CommonsXilinx is the largest supplier of FPGAs, an important component needed for 5G. As such, Xilinx is seen as a way to play the 5G rollout. In theory, demand should go up with 5G networks being deployed worldwide. Xilinx should therefore benefit from the upgrade to 5G. A big part of the bull thesis for Xilinx rests on this assumption.But recent quarterly reports are putting a dent in that belief. Xilinx reports that its WWG segment is seeing a slowing down of the 5G rollout. On the other hand, 5G deployment is accelerating in China with Huawei the leading supplier of telecom equipment. This suggests that Xilinx is getting shut out of a large part if not all of the Chinese market, an important development since China was by far the largest market for 4G base stations and is expected to retain that position in the 5G era. Xilinx looks more and more like a casualty of the trade/tech war.Xilinx is responding to recent events by scaling back expectations. The reduction in headcount suggests that Xilinx does not expect the 5G windfall to be as big as it once thought it would be. Xilinx does offer a glimmer of hope that the company will start to improve with Q3 behind us.However, Xilinx may still be underestimating the impact of recent events. There may be a lot of chip inventory out there that has yet to be used. That could hold down demand for products from Xilinx for quite some time. In addition, Huawei remains a wildcard. If Huawei can supply equipment that does not need Xilinx, the latter could be experiencing headwinds for far longer than it anticipates.With all this in mind, it's best to remain neutral and stay on the sidelines. There is a lot of uncertainty hanging over Xilinx. The company has already had to change some of its previous statements on a number of issues. Odds are that we have not seen the last of these changes and corrections."
4280093,77985,2019-08-01T09:50:01-04:00,"Xilinx beat earnings and posted record revenues, but revised forward guidance gives reason to be concerned.Xilinx acknowledges Huawei’s impact, but Victor Peng believes that the fallout will be contained due to a number of reasons.If Victor Peng’s assumptions turn out to be wrong, Xilinx could stand to lose a lot more than it currently believes is possible.Standing on the sidelines is best when the stock has gained as much as it has and there is much in need of clarity.","Xilinx (XLNX) did not react well in the aftermath of its FQ1 2020 earnings report on July 24th. While EPS beat expectations and Xilinx posted record quarterly revenue, its Q2 forward guidance came in lower than expected. The guidance seems to have disappointed investors who were hoping for more from Xilinx.Especially since, despite the recent decline, the stock is still up by over 40% YTD. Such a large gain is an indication that expectations are high and any shortcomings will punish a high-flying stock. However, Xilinx also expects a better second half, even if it decided not to reiterate full year guidance. Xilinx will instead wait until October for another update on fiscal 2020. Such hesitance on the part of Xilinx could be interpreted as Xilinx taking a wait-and-see approach since there are a number of issues, trade especially, that require further clarity.This leaves the investor in a somewhat tricky situation. What to do since Xilinx itself seems unsure about the road ahead. In the absence of further information, the only remaining option is to evaluate what information there is and make a decision based on that.Xilinx kept growing in fiscal Q1 2020. Net income increased by 30% YoY from $192M to $249M. Revenue grew by 24% YoY from $684M to $850M. Good numbers, but the problem is that the pace of growth is showing a troubling trend. Growth is slowing down if we look at the table below, which is not good considering how much the stock has run up over the last twelve months.Source: XilinxThis trend and the fact that Xilinx lowered its Q2 forward guidance is worrisome for those who had expected Xilinx to go on a sustained growth trajectory. Especially with 5G rolling out, which is arguably the main reason why people are bullish about its prospects. The downward revision was mainly driven by Huawei according to the earnings call:A transcript of the FQ1 2020 earnings call can be found here.The U.S. government decided in early May to put Huawei on its Entiry List, which means that it needs permission to do business with U.S. suppliers. That includes Xilinx, which is the biggest supplier of field-programmable gate arrays (""FPGAs"") such as the ones used in communications equipment. FPGAs will be crucial in 5G radio access network infrastructure, including base stations.That Xilinx would have to revise guidance was expected by some. For instance, this article suggested that the spike in FY2019 revenue was amplified by Chinese companies stocking up on semiconductor chips in anticipation of possible sanctions from the U.S. government. In the table below we can see that revenue in FY2019, which ends on March 30th, jumped by roughly 25% after several years of relatively stagnant growth.In fact, a question was asked whether Huawei could have accumulated as much as two years' worth of inventory. CEO Victor Peng replied that he does not subscribe to the notion of that kind of inventory build rates.Victor Peng also seems to think that Huawei will have no credible domestic suppliers of FPGAs. From the earnings call:Huawei's only remaining option would be to design its own application-specific integrated circuits (""ASICs"") if they're unable to acquire FPGAs due to the Entity List.However, it's worth pointing out that using ASICs to replace FPGAs at an early stage of the 5G rollout will present problems to Huawei. Unlike FPGAs, ASICs cannot be reprogrammed in case the ASIC implementation contains design bugs. Something that is very likely considering the complexity of 5G's physical layer.A wiser move would be to validate the design of ASICs through the use of FPGAs before committing to migrating for deployment. If Huawei cannot use FPGAs for prototyping and fine-tuning its 5G designs, Huawei will be at a competitive disadvantage compared to other equipment providers that do retain this ability.Another noteworthy revelation is that Victor Peng does not believe that lost sales due to Huawei are something that cannot be recovered. From the earnings call:This statement seems to imply that Huawei will be forced into some sort of agreement with the U.S. if it intends to keep working on 5G because they will be unable to find replacements otherwise. This leaves open the possibility that Xilinx may resume supplying Huawei in full as part of a deal.But even if that doesn't happen, Xilinx can make up for lost sales by conducting more business with Huawei competitors. Victor Peng alludes to this when he states:In theory, Huawei rivals could replace it if the company is unable to build 5G infrastructure. Huawei competition includes companies like Nokia and Ericsson, but also ZTE, a smaller competitor of Huawei in China. All these companies can source components from Xilinx. If they get more 5G business with Huawei struggling, Xilinx will benefit from increased sales.These statements from Victor Peng seem to be suggesting between the lines that a Huawei ban will not necessarily hurt Xilinx all that much. He was even asked if he's trying to convey that Huawei's customers will switch to other vendors if they're unable to deliver. Victor Peng declined to state that was his message, but his answer was phrased in such a way that it left open the possibility of that happening.If Xilinx is not counting on Huawei, then that makes sense because it's almost certain that Huawei will not be allowed to source components for 5G infrastructure, including those from Xilinx. An interview with Larry Kudlow reveals the current stance of the U.S. administration:So Huawei will most likely be allowed to source some components, but nothing related to 5G as far as the U.S. is concerned. A transcript of the Larry Kudlow interview can be found here.It's important to take into account the perspective from the other side. Huawei's CEO has been consistent in his confidence that his company will be able to keep rolling out 5G even if it cannot do business with U.S. suppliers. In a recent interview, he reiterated this viewpoint:This viewpoint stands in stark contrast to that of Victor Peng. Which of the two is right remains to be seen. A transcript of the interview with Huawei's CEO can be found here.Source: Wikimedia CommonsXilinx is seen by some investors as a way to play the 5G rollout. That makes sense because it provides a crucial part for 5G. But all the available information make it clear that government policy in the form of the Huawei ban has affected Xilinx. Nevertheless, Xilinx is in a rough patch, but it seems to believe that better times are coming based on the earnings call:However, Victor Peng is making a number of assumptions in the process. For example, it's assumed that Huawei will not be able to find replacements for Xilinx. An assumption that is disputed by Huawei's CEO. If Victor Peng turns out to be incorrect about his assumptions, then the outlook for a better second half may also have to be re-evaluated. If Huawei is able to successfully execute 5G contracts without access to U.S. suppliers, then that will be a big negative for Xilinx.Not only will Huawei's competitors not gain 5G contracts from Huawei, but Huawei could even capture market share from rivals that source supplies from Xilinx. Xilinx could stand to lose a lot depending on how successful Huawei is in continuing without Xilinx. The latter could basically get frozen out from participating in places where Huawei is running the show.Since there is no way to verify which of the two CEOs is right, the possibility exists that Xilinx has further to fall if Huawei manages to do what many, including Xilinx, are not expecting. Especially since the stock has gained so much in anticipation of the reward from 5G.It's possible that Xilinx may not benefit from 5G as much as expected. Neither the company nor the stock has yet to take this into account. For instance, if Xilinx finds out that Huawei can get the FPGAs it needs, it may have to cut forward guidance even more and abandon its outlook for a better second half. It's therefore better to stay on the sidelines with regard to Xilinx until there is more clarity on all these issues."
4292341,76975,2019-09-18T16:29:26-04:00,"The market has continued being rather lukewarm on Xilinx ever since the Huawei ban.A leading Wall Street analyst recently downgraded the shares on concerns about FaaS delays.Yet, peering deeper at the company's prospects reveals a business still in the pink of health.","Nearly 11 months have elapsed since I published my first article on FPGA leader Xilinx Inc. (NASDAQ:XLNX). In the article, I waxed bullish on the company’s data center prospects especially after it launched Versal, the industry’s first chips built on ACAP(Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform).The main thrust of the article was that Versal’s ability to optimize all architectures (DSPs, domain-specific engines, memory and programmable logic) on the fly solved a major bugaboo for FPGAs (difficult to program) and was likely to be a game-changer in helping Xilinx capture significant market share in an arena dominated by CPU and GPU makers like Intel Inc. (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia Inc. (NASDAQ:NVDA).Back then, Versal had just launched and even the company’s management was unable to offer any insights on product ramp-up. Nevertheless, the investing community happily bought into the company’s new ‘‘Data Center First’’ mantra, bidding up XLNX shares 52.6% from the time of publication until the Huawei ban threw a spanner in the works—I offered my mea culpa in an article I published on Xilinx’s FPGA rival Lattice Semiconductor Corp. (NASDAQ:LSCC). You could argue that XLNX had run to far too fast and had that coming.All is not lost though with the shares still up 38.8% vs. 8.01% by the S&P 500 since time of publication.Still, I believe that investors are being overly pessimistic about the company and missing the forest for the trees. I agree Huawei remains a critical overhang for XLNX until the next course of action by the Department of Commerce after the 90-day stay of execution comes to an end in October. I, however, take exception to the recent downgrade by Keybanc Capital Markets which cut its XLNX price target from $140 to $130 based on the delayed launch of Microsoft Inc.’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) FPGA-as-a-Service, or FaaS--a project that will see the cloud company deploy Xilinx’s Alveo onto Azure.I concede that a $130 PT is still quite decent since it represents a respectable 25% upside and is not far removed from the Street’s average PT of $133.25. However, it’s the principle behind the downgrade that rung the tocsin for me. The question that immediately came to mind was: just how big is the FPGA-as-a-Service SAM (Serviceable Available Market) and how big could it become in the future? What opportunity cost XLNX is incurring by Microsoft delaying the launch of its FaaS offering?Source: NasdaqBut first things first: what exactly is FPGA-as-a-Service, or FaaS? FaaS is an emerging cloud application in data centers where cloud companies like Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft, Alibaba Inc. (NASDAQ:BABA) and Baidu Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU) offer small-scale FPGA instances to end-users via their clouds. FaaS provides a unified hardware platform and middleware on the cloud that helps to significantly reduce development costs of accelerators. The service is available on demand and helps developers eliminate the common hardware barriers of acceleration technology.Amazon, Alibaba and Baidu use Xilinx FPGAs in their data centers and also offer Xilinx instances to end-users via their clouds. AWS is perhaps the most prominent of the lot and has been working with solution providers to provide shrink-wrapped tools and applications that utilize AWS F1 FPGA instances. Microsoft is actually the biggest user of FPGAs in its data centers (Project Brainwave) but does not yet offer them to the public as FaaS. Meanwhile, Xilinx’s FPGAs in Alibaba’s AliCloud have been credited for accelerating billions of transactions; serving up over 45 billion personalized recommendations to shoppers and helping the company hit a record $30B in sales during last year’s Singles Day.I have scoured high and low trying to find any solid FaaS market estimates but unfortunately couldn’t find any. So I have resorted to a proxy provided by Moor Insights & Strategy who are emerging as experts in the field. Around the time Amazon launched its FaaS project in 2017, Karl Freund, senior analyst for HPC and machine learning at Moor Insights & Strategy, told the EE Times that the FaaS market was tiny--a few million dollars at most. He, however, conceded that the market could grow as much as 5x annually for a few years if real demand kicked in. Assuming the market was worth $5M at the time but has grown at Karl Freund’s amazing clip, then the FaaS market is currently worth ~$125M—divvied up between at least three cloud behemoths.However, that could be an optimistic take. Karl Freund had also offered estimates that AWS needed to rapidly ramp up from 3 AMIs on offer at launch to100 F1 FPGA instances or so to have any material impact on the market. Unfortunately, AMI count enjoyed a nice ramp during the first year but seems to have stagnated at just 19. While that indicates some interest in the application supply-side of the equation which is necessary if we are going to see a knee in the demand curve, it’s hardly earth-shattering and probably not indicative of the 5x growth that Karl had hoped for.The small market and muted growth could be the reason why Microsoft is not in a big hurry to launch its FaaS project--and why Xilinx might have to wait longer for the big order to arrive. It’s also the reason why I thought the Keybanc downgrade was rather harsh because the FaaS opportunity was not that big in the first place. Microsoft and its cloud rivals are unlikely to aggressively ramp their FaaS offerings unless the demand side of things improves considerably.So that begs the question: what’s going on here? Why is FaaS not taking off as fast as we had hoped?The answer could lie with another FPGA company. French startup Accelize, a spin-off of the PLDA Group, employs an FPGA-acceleration-as-a-service model that help cloud vendors increase compute instances with FPGAs by offering users custom hardware acceleration for their specific applications. The main idea is to provide easy-to-use FPGAs for the end user.As Stéphane Monboisset has told EE Times, cloud vendors are focussing on providing FPGA as a service whereas the end-user is actually looking for acceleration as a service. Monboisset contends that IP procurement could be a stumbling block for FaaS vendors because IP providers generally prefer a traditional one-time cost model whereas cloud companies champion the pay-per-use, per-hour model. Persuading IP providers who used to receive as much as $450,000 upfront to settle for a dollar an hour is definitely not going to be a walk in the park.Source: EE TimesAccelize is not having a field day either, with estimated annual revenues of just $2.1M.I believe that XLNX investors should focus more on the firm’s iconic Versal chips rather than FaaS because the company apears fully committed to making ACAP a mainstream computing platform on the same level as CPUs and GPUs (Xilinx has sunk ˃$1B into Versal R&D).Versal’s highly reconfigurable memory hierarchies and intelligent fabric will quite likely expand FPGA adoption considerably with the chip being deployed for Data Center acceleration platforms to embedded designs. Versal supports anywhere from tens to hundreds of cores as well as terabits of memory bandwidth. It can be deployed for ˂5 watt automotive SOCs to 75 watt PCIe cards all the way to 200 watt-node for Hup to PC.With Versal, Xilinx apears to have avoided the pitfall of trading a major software challenge (programming an FPGA) for an even bigger set of hurdles (programming across an SoC containing FPGA, DSPs, ARM and AI Engines). Xilinx is developing compiler technologies that will automate and optimize all these functions somewhat automatically thus allowing the compiler to take on the burden of determining the compute resources and fabric routing required for balanced execution. This high adaptability makes it ideal for AI inference workloads with edge and data center inferenceTAM projections of nearly $23B by 2023 from ~$6B currently. Source: XilinxAnd, so far so good.During its latest earnings call, the company reaffirmed that early signs have been really encouraging. Sampling of the 7-nanometer Versal AI Core and Versal Prime Series products began last quarter with several hundred customers with the exercise expected to continue over the next few quarters. So far, Xilinx says Versal silicon testing indicates the chip is on track to deliver 10x increase in performance as well as significant power efficiency gains compared to the latest generation FPGAs and general-purpose CPUs.The company expects to commence production in FY 21 and so we probably won’t see a big jump in revenues for the time being. Versal though could be the chip that eventually pulls the company’s DCG segment out of its rut. Interestingly, last quarter, DCG was Xilinx’s worst performing segment partly due to Huawei and partly due to a slowdown in product transition by a significant but unspecified memory customer.That could become a thing of the past when Versal starts ramping. And we all know how Wall Street and investors alike love strong data center growth.Versal though will have Intel’s newly launched Agilex chips to contend with. Intel unveiled Agilex in April, marking the first line of FPGAs developed from the ground up since its 2015 acquisition of Altera for $16.7B.Agilex chips will be made using Intel's 10nm manufacturing process and add several billion transitors to comparable FPGAs from earlier generations. Molded on Intel's second-generation HyperFlex architecture, the chips are reputed to offer 40 percent higher performance than the current breed of high-end Stratix 10 line by Altera’s legacy brand.Source: Network WorldBut don’t lest Versal’s superior process fool you.Moorhead points out that Agilex actually features a higher transistor density with total transistors on both chips being nearly equal.The pitch is similar, too: programmable processors that offer a wider variety of programming options than prior FPGA generations. They also seem to be about neck-to-neck in the marketplace considering neither company is yet to announce OEM support for its new FPGA chip. The biggest comfort for XLNX investors: the company has usually enjoyed a considerable technology and market share lead in the FPGA market, which is hardly surprising wityh Xilinx being the true pioneer of the reprogrammable chips.Another interesting FPGA player to watch is Effinix which is offering the so-called Trion FPGAs that leverage quantum technology with 4X power-performance-area advantage over traditional FPGA technologies. But just like Lattice Semi, Effinix ix more interested in the low-end of the market that Xilinx and Intel normally ignore.During its latest call, Xilinx’s management sounded very optimistic about the company’s ability to overcome any revenue shortfall should Huawei receive a complete ban(˂10% of revenue last term) particularly due to strong trends in 5G, wireless, IoT and automotive as well as robust performance by its high-margin advanced product (53% year-over-year growth, 69% of total sale in FY Q1).Xilinx’s value proposition remains as strong as ever despite the Huawei overhang. I expect the shares to hit $140 over the next 12-18 months (22%-34% annualized growth).Long XLNX."
4285559,24757,2019-08-14T13:50:41-04:00,"Xilinx is in an up cycle based on 5G, despite Huawei woes.AI opportunities favor Xilinx.2020 should mark an acceleration in revenue and profit.","Xilinx (XLNX) is known for specialized semiconductor chips known as FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays). While these chips are not as broadly used as the better known CPUs that are in every personal computer and smart phone, they do have a broad variety of specialized uses. AI (artificial intelligence) is a rapidly expanding, increasingly practical field that will require orders-of-magnitude changes in the semiconductor industry in the coming decades. Xilinx's older products have been used in many AI applications, but a new set of products will allow the company to break out in much the same way Nvidia (NVDA) did in 2017. I believe the upward acceleration will be clearly visible in 2020.I would not call Xilinx stock cheap, but it has been held back by concerns about the trade war and Huawei. I will first describe the AI opportunity. Then I will discuss the stock in the context of Q2 results, the trade war and 5G wireless rollouts. That will lead to my argument that the stock is a buy for long-term investors based on the potential of sales into a booming AI market.Artificial intelligence is not new, but it has evolved rapidly since 2010. While autonomous vehicles are the best-known coming application for AI, versions of it have already been used for applications like facial recognition and modeling complex systems.CPUs are typically general purpose computing chips. They can be programmed in a wide variety of ways, and in PCs and smart phones can shift rapidly between applications. When running the same application repeatedly FPGAs may lend an advantage. They can be reprogrammed, but typically are programmed just once, then used to run the same application with a high degree of efficiency. They can be updated if necessary. Xilinx's Spartan chips are a typical example of FPGAs. They are particularly good at signal processing, which makes them useful in wireless and wired communications, as well as in industrial and military products. Both CPUs and FPGAs have a history of use for AI.Virtex FPGA (Source: Xilinx.com)Graphics chips can also be used for some types of AI. The same graphics processing chips that put images on a computer screen can be programmed to manipulate arrays of information very quickly, which words well for tasks like facial recognition and pattern recognition generally. That is why Nvidia was able to capture much of the AI server market in 2017 and 2018.AI requires a lot of computational power, particularly when a task (say, deciding whether to cause an automobile to brake) is done in real time. Depending on the task, this may not be efficient on a graphics chip, CPU, or even a specially programmed FPGA. That is why Xilinx is taking the AI game to the next level with its ACAP (Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform) chips. These chips combine multiple FPGA, memory, DSP (digital signal processing), CPU, and software programmable compute engines on a single chip connected by an on-chip network (per Xilinx ACAP press release).These chips are now sampling under the tradename Versal. That means product makers can get enough to test them for inclusion in new hardware designs. Victor Peng, president and CEO of Xilinx saidThese chips can be used in the cloud to do AI for connected devices, or they can be incorporated locally, for instance into automobiles or scientific instrumentation.There is no Versal ACAP revenue to speak of yet, with just a few chips shipped in the June quarter. I would expect sampling and development to dominate for the rest of 2019, with some larger scale production coming online in 2020, with 2H much stronger than 1H.Fortunately Xilinx has been doing well lately, benefiting from the beginning of the 5G wireless ramp. Revenue in Q2 2019 (fiscal Q1 2020) was a record $850 million, up 24% y/y. GAAP net income was $241 million up 27% from $190 million year-earlier, resulting in diluted GAAP EPS of $0.94. On an adjusted, non-GAAP basis diluted EPS was $0.97.The revenue and profit ramp was largely, but not exclusively, due to the beginning 5G deployments that use Xilinx chips. Xilinx reports three segments. Best on a y/y basis was Wired and Wireless at $349 million, up 66% y/y. This was driven by 5G is ramping in Korea and now in China, despite being hurt by less Huawei business. Also helping was the Automotive, Broadcast, and Consumer segment with revenue of $128 million up 10% y/y. Dragging totals down was the Data Center segment with $42 million, down 13% y/y, also hurt by less Huawei business.When Xilinx will be allowed to ship all of its products again to Huawei is unknown, but with revenue up 24% y/y anyway, that should not be a great concern, yet. If the trade war were to push the world economy into a recession or depression, that would be another story.It is important to note that the 5G ramp has just begun. So even without the new ACAP chips, I would expect 2020 to be a record revenue year for Xilinx, just as 2019 looks to be.I believe any short-term headwinds for Xilinx will be overcome by the longer-term AI opportunity. It is hard to estimate the size of this revenue opportunity, but it will be on top of any 5G ramp. It will be determined by customer adoption, percent of market share captured, and how quickly AI gets incorporated into a variety of end products. For now I am just going with really big, and hope to watch the revenue start ramping in 2020. Keep in mind at first revenue from Versal will be small compared to Xilinx's established chip lines, but it should grow at a much faster rate.I hesitate to put a target price on Xilinx stock, in this case assessing that there are trade war risks and that the China 5G ramp might not go according to prior expectations. As I said in my introduction, I would not describe Xilinx as cheap. It has a forward P/E ratio of 27.6. It also pays a dividend, which is $1.48 per year. Like the rest of the market the stock price has had a volatile year. The 52-week high was $141.60, the 52-week low $68.76. That is an ample spread for short-term speculation. I doubt we will revisit the lows as long as 5G keeps ramping and the ACAP opportunity is ahead.Data by YChartsI have owned Xilinx since 2014 and I am quite happy with this investment. There are competitors, notably Intel's (INTC) Altera division, and a number of smaller FPGA players. I see little downside aside from macroeconomic risks, while I see lots of potential upside over the next decade."
4271927,77985,2019-06-25T01:45:55-04:00,"The 5G rollout requires FPGAs, which should benefit Xilinx as the number one supplier of re-programmable integrated circuits.The trade war and the banning of Huawei could offset the benefits Xilinx was set to receive from carriers upgrading to 5G networks.Demand for Xilinx may have been artificially inflated due to Chinese companies stocking up in anticipation of possible sanctions.Standing on the sidelines is the prudent move as long as Xilinx is surrounded by unresolved issues that could pull down forward guidance.","A significant portion of the world is currently in the process of upgrading their communication networks to support 5G technology. Obviously, this is good news for companies that provide the components needed for 5G to work. One of the biggest beneficiaries should be Xilinx (XLNX). Not only is Xilinx the company that invented the Field Programmable Gate Array (“FPGA”), but it’s also the number one supplier of FPGAs.FPGAs are a type of integrated circuits that have the ability to be reprogrammed after they’ve been manufactured. Their logic can be reconfigured, which makes FPGAs distinct from other integrated circuits such as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (“ASICs”) that feature fixed logic. The ability to adapt gives FPGAs a level of flexibility that engineers can call upon whenever necessary, which can be quite useful. Eventually, some of the FPGAs could be replaced by ASICs once the equipment has matured, but in the early stages FPGAs should rule the roost.The ability of FPGAs to be reconfigured is crucial in 5G cellular base stations, which is why FPGAs are an absolute must-have with 5G being rolled out by many carriers. Especially in the early stages of the 5G rollout, which is mostly concerned with building the infrastructure needed to enable 5G networks.In particular, the emphasis at this stage will be on radio access network equipment, which includes base stations. Any investor who is looking to ride the boom in 5G could consider Xilinx as the need for base stations ensures that demand for FPGAs will be strong in the coming years. The bull thesis for Xilinx is therefore not that difficult. 5G requires FPGAs and Xilinx supplies FPGAs.However, while the future outlook for Xilinx looks bright, there are a number of other issues that investors also need to take into account. These issues may cause the stock to fluctuate and maybe even decline in the short term as they await resolution.The fact that numerous countries have expressed their intent to set up 5G networks is a positive development for Xilinx. However, a number of recent developments have complicated the bull thesis. The first headwind is the trade war with China and the Huawei ban in particular. Huawei happens to be the largest cellular equipment provider, which means they’re a big source of demand for FPGAs.Huawei will need FPGAs. However, if they’re not allowed to source them from Xilinx due to sanctions imposed by the U.S. government, then Xilinx will suffer a drop in demand that looked certain not that long ago. In addition, Huawei will be forced to pursue alternative options that may not bode well for Xilinx.Huawei’s response to the U.S. ban could create a long-term problem for Xilinx for several reasons. If Huawei cannot source FPGA’s from Xilinx or any other American supplier such as Intel (INTC), then they will have to consider other options. One option is to look at domestic suppliers of FPGAs in China.There are apparently several companies in China that supply FPGAs, both state-owned enterprises and private firms. Examples are China Electronics Corporation and Gowin Semiconductor Corp., although it remains to be seen how their products compare to those from Xilinx. Huawei will also need to spend resources redesigning their products in order to use FPGAs from different suppliers.Nevertheless, the possible introduction of new suppliers into Huawei’s supply chain is a problem for Xilinx. Assuming that products from competitors are up to snuff, Huawei may no longer be the source of demand that Xilinx was counting on. Depending on Huawei’s experience with its new suppliers, Huawei may not return as a customer, even if the ban is lifted.Another problem for Xilinx is that the Chinese suppliers of FPGAs could use this opportunity to grow and become formidable competitors of Xilinx on the global stage. The global market for FPGAs is relatively small and intense competition can really have an impact considering there is not that much demand for everyone to share.To put things in perspective, look no further than Intel. Intel became the second biggest supplier of FPGAs after its acquisition of Altera and the main competitor of Xilinx. However, the Programmable Solutions Group that deals with FPGAs at Intel only had $2.1B in revenue. The 2.1B only represented about 3% of total revenue at Intel. Using these numbers, it’s reasonable to assume that it will not take much for another company to have an impact on the market for FPGAs due to its small size.Another important aspect to consider is whether FPGA demand, starting from early last year when the trade war began, was real or inflated because companies in China were stocking up on inventory in anticipation of a possible ban by the U.S. government. The answer may be hard to determine, but it could have a significant impact on the prospects of Xilinx in the immediate future.Recall that in early 2018 the U.S. government imposed sanctions on ZTE, another provider of communications equipment from China. It’s quite possible that Huawei and others may have anticipated that they too could be subject to sanctions. Huawei and others may have concluded that it was necessary for them to have spare inventory of parts that they could call upon in case something happened.Huawei has apparently been stocking up on all sorts of chips, which presumably would also include FPGAs. However, it’s not exactly known how much Huawei has in inventory. What’s also unclear is by how much the stocking up of inventory affected the demand for semiconductors since early last year, including those from Xilinx.If we look at the table below, we can see that Xilinx experienced a big jump in revenue in the twelve months preceding March 30, 2019, after several years of relatively stagnant growth. This period also coincides with the trade war with China. It’s possible that the spike in revenue was not only due to increased demand with the imminent rollout of 5G, but also because of the trade war with China. Chinese companies may have pulled forward orders as a precaution in case they get cut off from the U.S. chip suppliers, Xilinx included.Source: XilinxXilinx had previously credited faster-than-expected ramp-up of 5G spending as the reason for the strong growth at Xilinx. A quote from Victor Peng on the company’s earnings call on January 23 alludes to this:A transcript of the earnings call containing this quote can be found here. While increased spending on 5G could have played a role, it’s not out of the question that Huawei and other Chinese companies have artificially raised demand.Was the strong demand for chips from China due to genuine demand or was it inflated because companies were simply stocking up? The answer is not clear at this point. But if much of the strong demand for semiconductors from Chinese companies in recent months was due to inventory buildup, then the bull case for Xilinx looks a lot weaker.Until quite recently, the bullish outlook for Xilinx made a lot of sense. 5G is rolling out and demand for Xilinx looks certain. But the recent escalation in the trade war with China and the Huawei ban in particular have clouded the outlook for Xilinx. Not only does it affect a major customer in Huawei, but there are a number of other side effects that are not in Xilinx’s favor as explained earlier.There are a number of unresolved issues hanging over Xilinx. Chief among them is whether or by how much the strong numbers in recent months may have been distorted by the fear of sanctions on China. The question of what will happen to Huawei is also not clear and whether they can be counted on as a source of demand. New suppliers of FPGAs from China could also weigh on Xilinx’s future prospects.In addition, Xilinx could be denied a significant role in the rollout of 5G in China, a country that contributes about 25% to revenue at Xilinx. That would be a big blow to Xilinx because the scale of 5G equipment needed for the 1.4 billion people in China is enormous. The Chinese government has said that it will issue a list of “unreliable entities,” which presumably will include U.S. companies that have stopped supplying Huawei. So there’s a chance that Xilinx may be included on that list, which could come with as yet to be determined penalties.As long as these issues have not been resolved, the most prudent thing to do is to move to the sidelines with regard to Xilinx. There’s a reasonable chance that Xilinx may have to revise down guidance, especially if demand from China is not as robust as previously thought. If that happens, Xilinx could retrace some of the gains it has made thanks to the exceptional results it posted in its last fiscal year.Source: Wikimedia Commons"

Xilinx (XLNX) is a company well-positioned to dominate over the course of many years by taking advantage of accelerating growth in technology.Xilinx is the leader in programmable logic. The majority of systems today are run by application specific designs such as CPUs, GPUs, ASSPs, and ASICS. Xilinx gives users a flexible solution that enables companies to bring the latest innovations to market faster. Xilinx's reprogrammable logic removes the high fixed costs associated with developing application-specific chips. Xilinx has begun rolling out Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP), a standard platform that can be leveraged into a wide variety of verticals. Displacing ASICS is a primary objective of Xilinx.SourceMoore's Law has been evidence that this ""Law of Accelerating Returns"" has merit. There's much speculation surrounding the future of Moore's Law and if this trend can continue. Some believe that the trend is alive and well, while others believe that it cannot continue forever, including the law's inventor Gordon Moore.Ray Kurzweil believes that Moore's Law is merely another paradigm in the story of the exponential growth of technology. He reasons Moore's Law will simply be replaced by a new paradigm when it loses steam. Xilinx believes its ACAP system is what will continue to offer faster speeds and more computing power following the erosion of Moore's Law.All good things must come to an end. With the sun setting on Moore's Law, there is a need to find new ways to accelerate computing. Xilinx believes ACAP is that solution. Xilinx is in a strong position to produce market-beating returns well into the future. Xilinx has a track record of innovation. Xilinx invented the FPGA in 1985. FPGAs are a $3.7-billion market expected to grow at an impressive CAGR of 10.87% through 2025. Xilinx is a financially strong, well-established dividend payer that makes sense for both growth and dividend-investing strategies.Xilinx has charted a new course under CEO Victor Peng who took over in January of 2018. The company's ""Data Center First"" strategy focuses on the most rapidly growing segments of technology. The company is poised to benefit primarily from the advancement of artificial intelligence and 5G wireless communications.What should excite investors the most is that the numbers show that while the market has begun to recognize Xilinx's brilliance, the bullish thesis for its data center hopes has yet to play out. The company's data center and TME segment shrunk by 12% quarter over quarter in Q4 2019. On the call, Peng attributed this slowdown to a customer pause, and reiterated the long-term tailwinds for Xilinx.Peng expects strong growth to return to the company's data center segment. Xilinx is still in the very early innings of this transformation. The company is finding its footing in the data center business but has a long runway.SourceOne driver of data center growth is Xilinx's expectations for the company's position in AI inference. Nvidia's (NVDA) powerful GPUs are the go-to chip for AI training. Xilinx believes inference will have a much larger total addressable market. AI spending is expected to grow by 38% over the next 5 years. According to the chart above, the next few years will be critical for investors to see whether Xilinx can capitalize on its AI ambitions.SourceAI Training is the process of the machine learning. Inference is the process of the machine inferring based on its previous training. Inference is the process of making use of the machine's knowledge. I am optimistic that Xilinx will translate success in AI because of its track record, such as the stunning numbers Xilinx has posted from early deployment of 5G.SourceDespite the slowdown in the company's data center business, Xilinx grew revenue by 30% last quarter on the back of stunning 74% growth in the company's communications segment. Looking at projections that only about 14% of mobile connections will be 5G in 2025 shows the incredible runway Xilinx has. Xilinx's massive growth in its communications segment is strong evidence of Xilinx's importance in the 5G rollout.I believe the stability of Xilinx's legacy business and the concrete evidence of Xilinx's wireless success offer investors a solid margin of safety at these levels. Success in AI could add significant value as well, but we don't yet have evidence as to how this will affect the bottom line.Xilinx is a financially strong business with ample cash available. The company has almost $3.2 billion in cash and short-term investments compared with no short-term debt and $1.2 billion in long-term debt. The company has a quick ratio of over 7, it has significant cash to invest in future growth. The company spent over $1 billion in the research and development costs for its ACAP program.If ACAP indeed evolves into Kurzweil's idea of the sixth paradigm of the exponential growth of technology, $1 billion in research and development is a steal. Xilinx has a history of making great use of its capital. Xilinx's strong cash flows and balance sheet bring to light the company's ability to generate cash on its investments. Other factors, including a favorable tax rate, gave the company a stunning 17.1% ROIC over fiscal 2019.Computation visualized via Omni CalculatorEven adjusting the tax rate to more standard rate of 25% yields a nearly 14% ROIC.Xilinx has impressive rates of return across the board. Margins are also stellar. Gross margins are above 70% and operating margins are above 30%. The company's large moat gives it strong pricing power.Xilinx is pioneering the ACAP system, so there is no competition in that regard. Xilinx's most direct competitor is Intel's (INTC) Altera. Xilinx hasn't reported its market share since 2017, where it reported about 60% of the FPGA market. Since Xilinx shifted focus to data center and other growth verticals, the company has differentiated itself from its direct competition.Taking all of this into consideration, the company is not expensive at 30x forward earnings. Xilinx is a semiconductor company that is in control of its own destiny and not as subject to macro struggles as much as its peers. Xilinx produces semiconductors that deploy advanced technology and are not commoditized. Xilinx and Nvidia command higher valuations because they are expected to grow revenues and profits faster than the industry.I expect any impact from the trade war to be minimal over the long term. I expect both nations to come to the conclusion that global trade benefits everyone. Xilinx's long-term secular tailwinds override short-term geopolitical headwinds.Data by YChartsIf the growth potential isn't enough to make a compelling case for Xilinx, the company also pays a dividend. With a 1.45% yield, the company should be able to continue to increase the dividend because of its strong ability to produce cash flow.I believe that Xilinx is positioned for growth into the future. I think shares will continue to appreciate as the 5G roll-out continues on a wider scale. It will be important to monitor the company's results to see if they can continue to post torrid growth in communications. 5G success was enough alone for me to buy the stock; if the company's AI dreams play out as the company hopes, I believe there is significantly more room to the upside for Xilinx."
4299886,77985,2019-10-29T10:18:49-04:00,"Xilinx managed to grow revenue and net income in Q2, but Q3 guidance and a slowing trend are cause for concern.Despite the current headwinds, management thinks that Q3 will be the bottom and Q4 will be the start of a recovery.Xilinx is not counting on Huawei for the rest of FY2020, but that does not mean that there’s no more risk for Xilinx.Xilinx will likely have to deal with more trade restrictions as a consequence of a race between the U.S. and China.","Xilinx (XLNX) released its Q2 FY2020 earnings results on October 23. The company managed to grow revenue by double digits, but weak Q3 guidance weighed on the stock. At the same time, management expects Q3 to be the bottom with a recovery starting in Q4. But there is a possibility that Xilinx may have to contend with more headwinds down the road. What these headwinds are will be detailed next.If one looks at just the headline numbers from Xilinx, Q2 doesn’t look all that bad. But upon closer look, some worrying signs appear. For instance, Q2 revenue increased by 12% YoY and net income increased by 8% YoY. Decent numbers, but revenue and net income decreased by 2% and 4% respectively when compared to the previous quarter.Source: XilinxFurthermore, if we go back even more, we can see that growth is way down from where it used to be. For example, net income grew by 30% in Q1, but fell to just 8% in Q2. Guidance for Q3 looks even worse. The expectation was for Q3 revenue of $845M and revenue of $3.4B for the whole year. But Xilinx is now forecasting Q3 revenue of $710-740M, a decrease of 9.4% at its midpoint. Revenue for FY2020 is forecast to increase by 6.1%, but that is far below the 24% growth in FY2019.Note that Q2 is the first full quarter with the Huawei restrictions in place. Recall that the U.S. government put China’s Huawei on the Entity List in May, which restricts Xilinx from supplying Huawei without permission from the government. These restrictions seem to have affected Xilinx as can be seen in the earnings report.It’s probably no coincidence that Huawei was mentioned several dozen times during the earnings call. It’s no longer a question of whether or not the Huawei restrictions will have an adverse impact on Xilinx. That question has been answered. What is not yet clear is whether the worst is behind us or whether there are more setbacks to be expected for Xilinx.While the headline numbers still show growth at Xilinx, the trend does not look favorable. However, CEO Victor Peng suggests that Xilinx will hit bottom in Q3 and then recover in Q4. From the Q2 earnings call:A transcript of the Q2 earnings call can be found here.Xilinx points to the global economic environment as a problem. The downside guidance for Q3 is the result of a challenging macroeconomic environment. From the Q2 earnings call:Ordering has been impacted by global trade issues. From the Q2 earnings call:Central to the current macroeconomic environment is the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China, which has seen a number of Chinese companies, Huawei in particular, come under trade restrictions. Xilinx applied for a license to do business with Huawei, but the application was not approved by the U.S. government and the restrictions remain in place. From the Q2 earnings call:As a result, Xilinx no longer expects Huawei to contribute to revenue for the remainder of FY2020.Huawei’s removal may lead some people to conclude that the issue has been settled and that there’s no further risk for Xilinx. But that does not necessarily have to be the case. A big reason behind the outperformance of Xilinx stock earlier in the year was the perception that the company was set to benefit from the impending 5G rollout.Xilinx happens to be the biggest supplier of FPGAs, a crucial component in 5G base stations. Since carriers worldwide are expected to invest heavily in the building of 5G base stations to ensure adequate network coverage, Xilinx appears to be in a good position to benefit from the 5G rollout. However, the Huawei restrictions put a damper on these expectations.Nonetheless, Xilinx remains a supplier to other telecommunications equipment providers, even with the absence of Huawei. From that standpoint, Xilinx can still consider 5G as a major opportunity. As Xilinx states in the Q2 earnings call:However, Huawei was expected to be hobbled by the inability to source U.S. components due to the restrictions imposed on the company. But Huawei seems to be more resilient than many had expected. Huawei claims it has started production of 5G base stations that do not contain any U.S. components. This is something that was not seen as possible. Huawei even says it will raise production of 5G base stations from 600,000 in 2019 to 1,500,000 in 2020.The ramp-up in production is made possible by the fact that Huawei has secured contracts with 65 customers for 5G equipment, a number that has steadily increased and puts it ahead of everyone else. China itself has also accelerated its 5G rollout. The Global System for Mobile Communications Association (“GSMA”) predicts that China will become the largest 5G market with 460M users in 2025.To ensure 5G service for such a large number of people, hundreds of billions will need to be spend. Huawei is expected to capture the biggest portion of the market. If Huawei continues to secure more and more contracts, other equipment providers could be left empty-handed and suffer accordingly. This may be the case with Nokia, which reported poor earnings not too long ago.Also affected would be the suppliers that provide components for these 5G equipment providers, which includes Xilinx. Previously, it didn’t matter all that much which provider came out on top in terms of contracts. Xilinx did business with all of them. But that is no longer the case. It’s now important for Xilinx that certain providers win contracts, if it is to benefit in full from 5G.Nevertheless, Xilinx maintains a presence in China as the company states in the earnings call:But the risk for Xilinx is that it could lose much of the opportunity that 5G provides. Every time Huawei signs up a new carrier for its equipment, Xilinx is left empty-handed because Huawei no longer uses U.S. components in its base stations. The more success Huawei has, the more problematic it becomes for Xilinx.Source: Wikimedia CommonsDuring the earnings call, Victor Peng remarked how his company was denied a license to supply Huawei. From the Q2 earning call:The decision by the U.S. government to deny a license to Xilinx is not that surprising.The U.S. sees itself in a race with China when it comes to 5G. A recent speech by President Trump reveals this line of thinking. He stated how “the race to 5G is a race that America must win” and that “we cannot allow any other country to out-compete the United States in this powerful industry of the future”.One way to slow down an opponent is to deny it important components needed to develop 5G. FPGAs fall under that category. It therefore makes sense from the viewpoint of the U.S. government to block Xilinx from doing business with Huawei. This is why Xilinx will likely have to stop counting on Huawei for not just the rest of FY2020, but for much longer than that.A race between the U.S. and China is likely to last years with neither side likely to concede to the other, which means that Huawei is most likely lost for the foreseeable future. In fact, there is a high probability that Xilinx will have to put up with even more trade restrictions.Since Huawei was sanctioned in May, there’s been a steady increase of Chinese companies added to the Entity List by the U.S. government. A U.S. State Department official recently stated that other tech companies in China are as much of a threat as Huawei. This suggests that they too will face sanctions at some point down the line. The list of companies mentioned includes Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), Alibaba (BABA) and Baidu (BIDU). Xilinx does business with all three of them.Bottom line, Xilinx is a supplier of products that are used in a wide variety of industries. Including some that are highly sensitive and strategic in nature. Xilinx has thus become affected by events that are outside of the company’s control. For better or worse, Xilinx has gotten dragged along by what looks to be a contest between the U.S. and China.Such a contest means that the Huawei restrictions are not an isolated incident, but a taste of things to come. Xilinx outlook that calls for a bottom and subsequent recovery in the near future may turn out to be too optimistic. It’s more likely that Xilinx will have to deal with additional headwinds caused by more trade restrictions from the U.S. government. If history is any guide, such trade restrictions are certain to have a negative impact on Xilinx.With this in mind, the prudent move is to be neutral on Xilinx. It’s not necessary to sell existing positions, but going long at this point could result in a significant haircut if Xilinx is hit with new restrictions. Unless of course, the U.S. and China come to some sort of an agreement that would free up Xilinx from the headwinds of trade restrictions."

This is creating a battle between FPGAs and GPUs.Nvidia is one of my favorite companies from a fundamental standpoint and Xilinx also makes a solid investment if/when you can secure the right entry point.","Nvidia (NVDA) fell off a cliff last October from a high of $290 to a low of $130. Meanwhile, the challenger Xilinx (XLNX) remained unharmed by the tech rout despite unfavorable macro conditions. Nvidia popularized GPUs in 1999 and Xilinx invented FPGAs in 1985, and both are chips that will define the computationally-intensive future.GPUs originated from the advanced computations required in gaming and FPGAs originated from electronics engineering. There are strengths and weaknesses to both; however, these are the two that will power the artificial intelligence and machine learning-driven economy. The size of this AI and ML economy is expected to reach $15 trillion by 2030, up from $2 trillion this year.Keep in mind, that long before technologies go public, they are incubating across the startup ecosystem. By the time AI and ML companies reach the public markets, the technology powering and developing this wave of companies was already decided in the years prior. We are in those critical years where startups must quickly design and develop AI if they want to have the first-mover advantage. This is creating a battle between FPGAs and GPUs.Below, I break down the differences between Xilinx’s FPGAs and Nvidia’s GPUs before analyzing the financials and theories on how the two will perform in the future.Note: Previously, I discussed how Nvidia's stock has two impenetrable moats: the developer ecosystem and GPU-powered cloud. This previous analysis was written during the height of the panic sell-off, which I negated as being overly-pessimistic due to Nvidia’s strong fundamentals.On many technical levels, FPGAs (Xilinx) are considered superior to GPUs (Nvidia). They offer a higher amount of on-chip cache memory to help reduce the bottlenecks from external memory, and are flexible enough to be reconfigured for various data types, such as binary, ternary, and custom data types, whereas GPUs must be modified at the vendor level.FPGAs are also known for power efficiency, and often test 10x better in power consumption than GPUs and also 4x better than GPUs for general purpose compute[1]. Reconfigurability for FPGAs also helps provide this efficiency beyond deep learning for a large number of end applications and workloads. The architecture of FPGAs is very adaptable as the chips allow a user to address all of the needs of a workload with the resources provided by FPGAs, such as reconfiguring the data path during run time and with partial reconfiguration. Meanwhile, GPUs are restricted as the architecture is a Single Instruction Multiple Thread (SIMT), which provides an advantage over CPUs but can result in lower performance efficiency when enough parallels cannot be found while mapping the workload.As pointed out in my previous analysis on Nvidia, software developers prefer GPUs as their frameworks are easier to develop on. Nvidia’s CUDA architecture, for instance, does not require an in-depth understanding of underlying hardware. FPGAs require knowledge of machine learning algorithms at the hardware level, in addition to the software development, and this has been a barrier to entry for FPGAs. FPGAs are a reconfigurable integrated circuit (hence the strengths on being easily reconfigured), which requires specifying a hardware circuit, whereas GPUs are configured via software[2].– software developer on RedditSection takeaway: FPGAs result in faster and more efficient computation but are harder to program due to hardware circuit configurations when compared to GPUs for machine learning, which are more universal and require less engineering resources.Nvidia and Xilinx power more than data centers, of course. Nvidia’s top revenue segment is gaming, the origin of GPUs, and this drives about $1 billion per quarter in revenue. Xilinx’s top segment is Communications with many investors using Xilinx as a global bet on 5G, with communications revenue increasing 41% year-over-year as reported in the most recent quarter. Xilinx also was not as affected by crypto as the Broadcast, Consumer & Automotive category was 17% of revenue compared to 15% of revenue in the same quarter YoY. (Xilinx classifies crypto as consumer in this 10-K).Xilinx has a direct competitor with Intel (INTC), which acquired Alterra for $16.7 billion. Intel is keen to solve the development uptake issues with FPGAs with the release of Stratix 10 hardware, which has a software layer to simplify development. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure is partnered with both Xilinx and Intel/Alterra on FPGAs, although there is some indication that MS is leaning more towards Xilinx in the near future after announcing they will replace Intel chips with Xilinx in over half of their servers.Developers favor Xilinx over Intel as a brand, and Microsoft is doing quite a bit to court developers right now including the acquisition of Github. Therefore, the shift towards Xilinx was not unexpected.While Xilinx reported double-digit increases, Nvidia reported double-digit declines, with revenue down 24 percent, earnings per share down 48 percent to $0.92 and operating income down a shocking 73 percent year-over-year in fiscal Q4. The annual numbers ended on a better note, with revenue increasing 21 percent to $11.72 billion, and GAAP earnings per share increasing 38 percent to $6.63. Of Nvidia’s revenue segments, gaming was hit the hardest due to the crypto bust flooding the market with GPUs, which in turn caused reduced unit shipments overall. In addition, the new Turing architecture and real-time ray tracing, while impressive from a graphics perspective, are ahead of their time and are seeing slow adoption (at release, I had originally put Q3 2019 for these to find early adopters and this timing still looks accurate or maybe Q4).This upcoming quarter is not likely to be the comeback quarter for Nvidia with guidance of $2.20 billion, which is flat from last quarter and represents a 31 percent decline year-over-year. As you’ll see in the takeaway paragraph below, I am very bullish on Nvidia in the long term as crypto causing temporary GPU saturation offered an opportunity to enter the stock below its value.Gaming is a foundation for Nvidia, but most certainly this is not the growth story. The GPU-powered cloud is the future due to AI and ML. If you can get Nvidia below a $100 billion market cap, then my prediction is you will be resting easy by 2022 and 2023 with a stellar return as its understated presence across cloud data centers and AI applications should have a firm hold on the market.Xilinx’s revenue growth is at 34% year-over-year in Q3 2019, with 63% growth in operating income YoY in the same quarter, and 42% net income growth. It’s important to mention that Xilinx is a small fish in a big pond and this quarterly growth of 34% and 42% equals $200 million to the top line and less than $100 million to the bottom line. Meanwhile, Xilinx commands a PE ratio of 38, at time of writing.Guidance for the upcoming quarter is revenue of $815 to $835 million compared to $800 million in the previous quarter. One reason Xilinx’s stock price continued to climb, while Nvidia fell off a cliff, is that the smaller fish did not have enough market share to reflect a big impact, whereas Nvidia’s crypto business alone exceeded Xilinx’s net income for the entire year (at around $500 million per quarter). In addition, one year ago Xilinx posted negative net income of $12 million but is now at a net income in the range of $200-$250 million the last two quarters.In other words, Xilinx is more of a trout than a tuna, but is a pure play option that is likely to see very solid returns as the AI economy is built out. (This is why I don’t invest in Intel; I prefer pure plays when possible).Snapshot of Xilinx Revenue segments:Source: XilinxNvidia is one of my favorite companies from a fundamental standpoint, and it is worth repeating that I was not fair weathered during the crypto bust, rather encouraged readers to look at the developer moat and GPU-powered cloud as future drivers of growth. As I stated to a reader over email two days before the Mellanox acquisition: “Can Xilinx’s FPGA disrupt Nvidia GPU’s at 4x faster? My best guess (and it’s only a guess) is that Nvidia will continue to release the right chips that the market demands.” In this case, Nvidia is acquiring the right company that the market demands. You can read my analysis on Mellanox acquisition published here.I want to point out that Xilinx will make a solid investment, as well. Xilinx is priced a minimum of 25-30% higher than Nvidia when looking at PE ratio, Price to Sales, and EPS. Quarter-over-quarter growth for Xilinx right now is in the single digits, and for this reason, I’d like to see Xilinx priced 20% cheaper before I build a position or I’d like to see more than single-digit QoQ revenue growth in a highly competitive market for a 30+ PE ratio. Due to Nvidia’s upcoming flat quarter (per guidance), Nvidia is also likely to trade sideways for a quarter or two. I bought Nvidia in 2017 and cost averaged down to $160, and am comfortable here for the long term."
4259208,103231,2019-05-02T14:47:17-04:00,"The company has lost 17% of its value after cutting its growth expectations from its aerospace and defense, industrial, and TME markets.The growth that Xilinx has seen in its 5G market is still one of the main reasons to keep the company in the long term.The growth in the wired and wireless group will be enough to compensate for the falls in other markets during the short term.However, the market seems to have entered a period of skepticism as more companies in the industry cut their growth expectations.","The price of Xilinx Inc. (XLNX) fell quickly after the company released its results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2019. Although revenues and EPS came in above analysts' expectations, the guide that executives gave for the next fiscal year was a difficult one to process for the market. The value of the shares, which had reached a record high as they appreciate 60% so far this year, contracted almost 17% as a result of the projected difficulties in their aerospace and defense, and test, measurement and emulation markets.Xilinx has received a lot of interest from the market in recent quarters as a result of its new position in the development of 5G technology, which has placed a high premium on the value of its shares. However, this trend in the communications market seems not to be enough for analysts, who also expect to see improvements in the data center and automotive markets before taking a more bullish view.Although we believe that the potential of the 5G market is one of the main reasons to keep Xilinx in the long term, it seems that conditions in other markets are raising doubts among investors. Some of these doubts revolve around how the weakness in its core markets will impact the company's results, and if these will offset the long-term trends in the communications segment.The annual revenues exceeding $3 billion for the fiscal year 2019 and saw an increase of 24%, which has accelerated in recent quarters thanks to the communications, and automotive, broadcast and consumer segments. Looking closely at the results of the fourth quarter, we see that the deployment of 5G in South Korea, and the preparation for the implementation of 5G in China, boosted the $828 million revenues in the period, a growth of 30% year over year.Source: The Data was extracted from filings from the SECAlso, the executives announced a new organization and structure of the revenue report to focus the company's efforts better. This new structure establishes new business units to better estimate the performance of the most strategic markets of the company. As a result of this, the previous communications segment will now become the wired and wireless group, or WWG. The data center group will now be reported separately, which we believe will give a better perspective of the performance of this pivotal business by separating it from the TME business. On the other hand, the aerospace & defense, industrial, and TME markets will be grouped in a segment called AIT, while automotive, broadcast and consumer (ABC) will remain the same.We see that this alignment is a statement of the company's intentions to segment its markets into strategic groups. On the one hand, there are the so-called core markets like those of AIT, a segment that would be the second most important for the company in terms of revenues. This line of business that now groups a broad range of end markets is characterized by a cyclical nature that seems to be entering a period of contraction. In this regard, the executives have projected that for the coming quarters this group will be “down meaningfully” due to a decrease in sales coming from the aerospace and defense, and TME.Historically these markets have performed better than other segments, which has widened the gross margin of the company. In our view, this negative outlook in the so-called core markets has significantly weighed on the quarterly results, causing a rapid correction in the price the shares despite the company reporting better numbers than expected.On the positive side, the fast-growing markets led by the WWG and ABC group will continue their accelerated pace in the medium term. Expectations for the renamed wired and wireless group continue to be positive. The 5G implementations that started earlier than expected are beginning to have material benefits for the company. Analysts expect that the 5G market will be much larger than the 4G due to the complexity of the new radio standard, expanding the total available market for Xilinx.Similarly, the automotive market seems well-positioned to continue to benefit in the long term. During 2019, this business grew at a double-digit rate thanks to new autonomous driving design contracts and artificial intelligence solutions for automobiles. The commercial success of Xilinx's Zynq MPSoC designs has positioned the company as a growing leader in advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS).Finally, the company disclosed the results of its recently separated data center group, which saw a 7% decline in the last quarter after maintaining double-digit growth in recent years. The pause in the spending of one of the most valuable customers in this segment caused this fall. In a broader perspective, the data center industry that has generated high expectations in the market has been impacted by problems surrounding the market conditions, affecting companies with a significant share in this space such as Intel Corporation (INTC), and NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA).Although Xilinx receives a modest portion of its revenue from its data center products, these difficulties have added to those of its core aerospace and defense, industrial, and TME markets.Source: Data provided by Ycharts.Overall, we see that the key driver of Xilinx's growth for the short and long term will be the WWG segment, which we believe will be enough to offset the difficulties of the core markets. Executives expect revenues for the next quarter to be in the range of $835 and $865 million, which means a 24% growth in the mid-point. Additionally, we estimate that these difficulties that have created doubts among analysts are transitory, so we expect growth in the data center, aerospace and defense, and TME segments to return to normal levels from the second half of the fiscal year 2020.Looking to the future, we believe that the imbalance of the new combination of final markets will affect the gross margin of the company. Due to the rapid growth of the WWG group, which is characterized by being slightly less profitable than the core markets, it has caused compression in margins that are becoming more evident in the last quarter. The gross margin, which historically has remained above 70%, has fallen to 67%, expecting this level to stay in the next two quarters.Source: Data provided by Ycharts.Xilinx continues to be one of the most profitable companies in the semiconductor space, even considering the future compression in the margins. The operating margin, which is expected to remain close to 30%, positions the company in the same range as its Intel and NVIDIA peers. Comparatively, the compression in profitability does not seem to place Xilinx at a disadvantage when taking into account the fundamentals of the industry.Source: Data provided by Ycharts.However, Xilinx shares are still trading at a slightly higher premium about the rest of the industry, even after a correction in the price. Comparatively, both PS and EV to EBITDA ratios remain above historical average levels of the company, although these multiples are relatively similar to their NVIDIA pair.We believe that the growth in revenues that Xilinx will maintain, even after cutting expectations for the coming quarters, is enough to justify these valuations. However, the market seems to be entering a period of skepticism as more companies slash their growth expectations. Although we believe that the prospects of Xilinx are positive and the investment thesis is sustainable in the short and long term, we believe that the shares will remain in a period of volatility during the short time due to issues in the semiconductor industry."
4235602,24361,2019-01-25T09:44:28-05:00,"Xilinx zigs while the rest of the semiconductor zags, as 5G, broadcast, data center, and aero/defense drive 34% yoy revenue growth, a strong beat versus expectations, and an upward revision.Xilinx is looking at significant opportunities across its end-markets, including 5G, ADAS/autonomous driving, machine vision/factory automation, and AI inference.With the big post-earnings spike, Xilinx shares look basically fairly-valued, albeit with exceptional momentum in the business.","Not too many semiconductor stocks have reported as of this writing, but with the Texas Instruments (TXN) and Intel (INTC) reports in, it looks like the market's fears of another round of downward guidance revisions for the first quarter are materializing. But then, there's Xilinx (XLNX) - quite possibly a true unicorn this quarter in not only reporting very strong growth (revenue up 34% yoy and 7% qoq) but also guiding UP for the next quarter.With strong earnings and the 5G opportunity seeming to come through sooner than expected, Xilinx shares shot up almost 20% and set a new 52-week high. Xilinx has a legitimate, differentiated opportunity with its strong FPGA and FPGA/SoC portfolio, including near-term opportunities like 5G wireless and auto ADAS and longer-term opportunities like data center/AI and autonomous driving. Although I think Xilinx can generate double-digit long-term revenue growth and that today's DCF-based fair value isn't unreasonable, it's certainly not an overlooked opportunity at this point.Xilinx reported 34% yoy and 7% qoq revenue growth for the December quarter (the company's fiscal third quarter), beating expectations by 4%.Although the company saw weaker demand from industrial customers and only flat sales to the auto sector, it hardly mattered. Communications revenue jumped 41% as the company is seeing broadening 5G deployments beyond South Korea (Texas Instruments management said they believe North American deployments have begun). Industrial, Aero, & Defense revenue rose 18% as stronger aerospace and defense demand counterbalanced weakness in factory automation and industrial IoT (hardly a surprise, given recent comments from Yaskawa (OTCPK:YASKY) and Nidec (OTCPK:NJDCY)). Datacenter and TME revenue was up 14%, which bodes well for Agilent (A), and revenue in the Broadcast, Consumer, and Auto market was up 20% on strength in broadcast.A mix shift toward communications has implications for margins, and gross margin declined 130bp year over year (flat sequentially), which was in line with expectations (arguably a beat, in effect, the unexpectedly high level of Communications revenue). Operating income rose 61% yoy and 11% qoq, with non-GAAP operating margin expanding by 550bp yoy (and 120bp qoq), helping drive a bottom-line beat.Better still, management gave strong guidance for the March quarter. Calling for 30% year-over-year revenue growth in the next quarter, Xilinx set a target about 6% above the prior average sell-side estimate.With the 5G ramp just beginning, Xilinx is in the early days of a market opportunity that could see its served addressable market grow by more than $2 billion over the next four years (to over $7 billion), with more FPGAs going into both radios and baseband. If there's a ""but"", it is likely concern that deployments could take longer than expected (which I don't consider probable) and/or that ASICs will eventually spoil the party. That has been the basic history of FPGAs - great growth eventually disrupted by the eventual introduction of lower-priced ASICs. Although that will probably happen here too, it will take a while.And 5G isn't the only thing Xilinx has going for it. The data center business is only about 5% of revenue now, even though Xilinx scored some early wins with Amazon (AMZN) (while Microsoft (MSFT) has gone with Intel/Altera). Xilinx has seen multiple hyperscale wins for its Smart NICs, though, and the new Alveo and ""AI Core"" chips should make Xilinx a legitimate competitor alongside Nvidia (NVDA) in AI inference - a market currently served mostly by Intel Xeon chips, but that could be worth over $6 billion in 2025 (according to SIG analyst Christopher Rolland) and where I/O fabric, cache size, and programmability are key factors (and where the single-chip ASPs are startlingly high).Auto, too, is a significant opportunity. About half of Xilinx's current auto revenue (around 3% to 4% of total revenue) comes from ADAS, where Xilinx is the #2 supplier today, and where expectations are for exceptional content growth over the next 10 years as cars incorporate more safety and assistance features on the path to partial or fully autonomous driving. This is perhaps one of the most uncertain markets for Xilinx, as there are so many chip companies throwing their hats into this rink (including Nvidia, Intel, and Renesas (OTCPK:RNECY) among others).On a more product-specific level, the Zynq platform continues to do exceptionally well, with very strong growth in MPSoCs that has helped lift this to about 20% of company revenue. Management has also started sampling its 7nm Versal Adaptive Compute Accelerated Platform family with customers in a range of markets.Xilinx has generally confined its M&A to small-scale deals for companies with important FPGA-relevant hardware or software capabilities. Most recently, the company acquired DeePhi, a start-up with capabilities relevant to harnessing FPGAs for machine learning (an obvious interest for Xilinx).Not so long ago, though, there was a rumor making the rounds (and reported on CNBC) that Xilinx was kicking the tires on Mellanox (MLNX). While the potential synergies in Smart NICs for hyperscale data centers would be significant, and Mellanox's relationship with Microsoft could possibly open some doors for Xilinx, it seems like that idea has died down. Although there would be clear risks in running a business that is very different from what Xilinx currently does, I can see some synergy and appeal to the deal, were it to happen.I think it is pretty clear that I'm bullish on Xilinx and its growth opportunities over the next five years or so. Xilinx has done a very strong job relative to Intel migrating to bleeding-edge nodes (16nm and 7nm), and the capabilities of FPGAs make them attractive options for some of the most demanding semiconductor applications today. Still, Xilinx is likely to get only just so far ahead of Intel (and vice versa), as there are some meaningful switching costs.I expect mid-teens annualized revenue growth over the next five years and low double-digit growth over the next decade, with 5G a big near-term opportunity and AI, advanced ADAS, and factory automation (including machine vision) offering longer-tailed opportunities. I also see room for further margin leverage, with adjusted FCF margins in the low 30%'s and mid-teens growth. On the subject of FCF, I'd note that stock option expense has been growing quite a bit faster than operating free cash flow over the past decade, cutting into adjusted free cash flow growth.Discounting the cash flows back, I think the shares are more or less fairly valued today, offering investors a long-term expected annualized return in the high single-digits. Xilinx also trades above what would otherwise be its ""fair"" EV/revenue multiple on the basis of its adjusted operating margins, which I attribute to the company's duopoly position in high-end FPGAs and its above-average growth prospects.Business is clearly going well at Xilinx today, and there is significant momentum in the business. There is some risk that revenue is being boosted by order pull-ins from China to avoid some export restrictions, but I don't believe that's a major issue at this point. The bigger issue is that the cat is out of the bag - Xilinx is the semiconductor unicorn now, and upside from here is most likely more of the growth/momentum variety, and that's not my investment style."
4236756,103231,2019-01-30T13:57:47-05:00,"The secular trends of its end markets, added to a business model based on FaaS, have made Xilinx the favorite within the semiconductor industry.The early 5G deployments in South Korea and China are a confirmation of the investment thesis that Xilinx has been presenting recently.Although the valuations seem to be somewhat elevated, the fundamentals show a solid company that deserves a premium.","There is no doubt that in a matter of a few quarters, Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ: XLNX) has become one of the semiconductor industry’s favorite companies. The number of buy recommendations by analysts has skyrocketed in the last two quarters, rising from four to 10 in a matter of months. Although the stock price has seen a similar increase in this period, we believe that the company still offers opportunity to those investors who are willing to pay a reasonable premium for a good company.We estimate that Xilinx's position in the industry reflects the strong secular trend that its product portfolio is having (see analysis of trends), as well as the transformation from an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) vendor to an FPGA-as-a-Service (FaaS) provider. Below we explain the factors that have allowed this company to position itself as one of the best companies in the industry.Xilinx showed better results than expected in the third quarter despite fears of a slowdown in the semiconductor industry. The company exceeded its own expectations by reporting revenue growth of 34% YoY, which was driven to a great extent by its Wireless Communications and Aerospace and Defense segments. Revenue reached the goal of $800 million quarterly for the first time thanks to the early deployments of its 5G products in South Korea and the preparation for the implementation of 5G in China and North America. The Wireless and TME sub-segments are expected to continue driving growth for the remainder of the fiscal year, allowing the company to exceed the goal of $3 billion in annual revenues for the first time.Data by YChartsFor its part, the Data Center and TME segment, which has generated more expectations in the last couple of years, grew 14% YoY. In the case of the Data Center sub-segment, the company saw greater activity in the commitment of companies such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), and Huawei to deploy their FaaS, which suggests that the demand for this type of ecosystem will continue its current step. Likewise, revenues in the TME sub-segment were both solid in the Test and Measurement area, and likewise in Emulation and Prototyping, reflecting Xilinix’s solid position in the market.Source: Data provided by Ycharts.In relative terms, it can be seen that Xilinx has positioned itself above peer companies in terms of revenue growth, thanks to the secular trends coming from its final markets. The transformation towards a platform company has managed to boost this growth, reversing the downward trend that was seen at the end of 2015.Xilinx’s chips of 28 nanometers and 16 nanometers have seen a sustained growth in the last couple of years thanks to the wide range of applications they have, serving markets as diverse as Communications, Automotive, Industrial, and Aerospace and Defense. Likewise, the company's new bet, its 7-nanometer product, will become the first Adaptive Computing Product (ACAP) of the industry to be launched, with an approximate delivery date during the second half of 2019.We see that this growth is beginning to move to the bottom of the income statement. The company has been characterized as having margins far superior to that of the industry, which has allowed it to see a significant growth in its EPS and FCF.In general, we see that Xilinx is one of the best positioned companies in the semiconductor industry from a growth perspective. The secular trend coming from its Communications and Data Center and TME segments seems sustainable in our opinion. We see that the pace of growth will continue in the long term as its Versal product portfolio creates new opportunities for the company.Xilinx has been characterized as having quite solid fundamentals. Both their margins and their rates of return tend to be above the rest of the semiconductor industry. Part of the success of the company's cost structure is due to improvements in manufacturing efficiency and the development of higher value products, which tend to maintain a more stable selling price as they mature.For the third quarter of 2019, the gross margin suffered a 1.3% contraction as a result of the increase in revenues of the Wireless segment. The company explains that the margins of this line of business tend to be lower. On the other hand, R&D expenses increased with respect to last year, adding up to $189 million. This increase can be attributed to a greater number of employees seeking to support the continuous development of new products and software, following the company's commitment to innovation.Source: Data provided by Ycharts.Despite this slight increase in costs, Xilinx remains one of the most profitable companies in the industry. Its wide margins have allowed it to benefit even more from its revenue growth, compared to similar companies. The high net profit margin has been transferred to a robust free cash flow, which has remained in positive territory thanks to relatively low depreciation.This performance has allowed the company to maintain a fairly active dividend payment and share repurchase program. For the third quarter of 2019, the company returned almost $92 million to investors in the form of dividends, adding about $273 million in dividends for the nine months of the fiscal year, and about $162 million in share repurchases.In comparative terms, we see that Xilinx maintains rates of return similar to the industry average, with an attractively low leverage. We see that most of the long-term debt is in the form of notes with maturities in 2019, 2021, and 2024. Although the 2019 Notes will expire in the next quarter and the company will have to settle $500 million, the company maintains $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents that provide sufficient liquidity to meet this commitment.Source: Data provided by Ycharts.Xilinx's products are in a strong secular trend that will keep growth in the range of double digits in the long term. The executives reviewed their expectations for the next quarter and expect revenues to be between $815 and $835 million, which would represent growth between 29% and 32% YoY.On the other hand, we believe that Xilinx has several competitive advantages thanks to its business model based on FaaS and its product portfolio. These characteristics together offer an uncertainty rating of medium to its financial results, an attribute that we consider attractive given the nature of the sector. As a result, the company's position in the semiconductor industry has become desirable, putting a large premium on its market value.Source: Data provided by Ycharts.In comparative terms, it has been observed that Xilinx has become, in a short time, a company with quite high price ratios. We see that the valuations of shares are similar to those of Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA), with similar fundamentals. However, comparing the differential between the PS ratio and the PS ratio going forward, Xilinx offers the largest spread of the companies compared, which suggests that future growth is not yet discounted in the price.In general, the initial 5G deployments in South Korea and China are a reaffirmation of the investment thesis that Xilinx has been presenting in the couple of years. The adoption of FPGAs in the chip industry seems to be a trend that will continue in the long term, benefiting Xilinx which maintains solid participation in this market."
4257149,23998,2019-04-26T13:38:52-04:00,"Xilinx was one of the top ten Portfolio Armor names I shared with Marketplace subscribers on April 18th. It's down 14.78% since, after its profit miss and downgrade this week.Here, I show how the Xilinx hedge in our top names portfolio from April 18th ameliorated that drop.I also address the question of how good my security selection process is, given its miss with Xilinx so far.","Image via Xilinx's Twitter page.Xilinx (XLNX) was one of Portfolio Armor's top names last week and was included in the top names portfolio I shared with my Marketplace subscribers last week. It has turned out to be an inauspicious pick so far, with the stock tumbling 17.08% on Thursday, in the wake of the company's profit miss and downgrade by Goldman Sachs (GS). A drop this steep in a stock can have a big impact in a concentrated portfolio, but this gives us an opportunity to see how our risk management works in practice. Let's start by looking at last week's portfolio which included Xilinx.This was the portfolio constructed out of our top names from April 18th and hedged against a greater-than-9% decline over the next several months. In addition to Xilinx, it included Armstrong World Industries (AWI), Chipotle (CMG), MarketAxess (MKTX), Nextstar Media (NXST), PayPal (PYPL), and VMware (VMW) as primary securities. Our site started out by allocating equal dollar amounts to each of those stocks, but then it rounded down the dollar amounts to get round lots of each since it's less expensive to hedge round lots. It then used Acacia Communications (ACIA), hedged with a tight collar, capped at the then-current money market yield, to absorb most of that cash leftover from the rounding down process.Screen capture via Portfolio Armor.As you can see above, each of the positions is hedged with either optimal (least expensive) put options or an optimal collar. Here's an expanded look at the optimal put hedge on XLNX:Screen capture via Portfolio Armor.Taking into account the cost of the hedge, the total position value for the Xilinx position as of the close on April 19th was ($134.95 x 1,700) + $19,465 = $248,880. We'll come back to that figure in a moment, as it represents our starting point. First, let's look at the performance of the underlying securities, unhedged.Data by YChartsIf you weren't hedging, you wouldn't have had to worry about round lots, so let's assume you purchased equal dollar amounts of each of those stocks. If so, you would have been down 0.47%, as of Thursday, April 25th's close. Note also that XLNX was down 14.78% over the time period.Here's how the hedged portfolio performed over the same time frame. Recall that it had a hedging cost of 5.31% initially and that the performance takes that into account.Recall from above that XLNX was down 14.78% unhedged, and our starting dollar amount for the hedged XLNX position was $248,880. Note the net position value for XLNX in the table above: $234,681.05. $234,681.05 represents a 5.7% decline from $248,880. So, although XLNX was down 14.78%, the hedged XLNX position was only down 5.7%.At this point, some readers may be questioning the merits of our security selection process given that one of our top names from last week, Xilinx, has done so poorly since then. It's a reasonable question. Like all security selection processes, ours gets picks wrong (that's why we recommend hedging). But overall, it has beaten the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). I've been posting my site's top ten names for subscribers each week and then tracking their performance over the next 6 months since June of 2017. So far, we have full 6-month performance for 73 separate cohorts. You can see the performance of all of them in the table below.The top names cohorts returned an average of 6.85% over six months versus 4.29% for SPY. That's an average outperformance of 2.56% over six months or 5.12% annualized."
4171522,23468,2018-05-08T22:44:16-04:00,"Lots of well-researched fundamentals exist in SA articles from qualified and capable analysts.But your portfolio doesn’t grow on supply and demand or street commentary.  Instead, play the players, the ones with the money muscle to make a difference.Here is what price range forecasts shake out of the hedging bushes from the market-making community due to the big-money-fund portfolio managers’ block-trade order activity.And the histories of how well prior forecasts for these stocks performed under earlier forecasts when the upside-to-downside outlook was like it is today.","This article intentionally has no fundamentals-analysis content. All of that analysis has been done by the information-gathering world-wide staffs of the Market-Making [MM] firms, instantaneously communicated to their HQ trade-desk support staffs of experienced, qualified value analysts whose judgments are enriched by the block-trade desk’s minute-by-minute knowledge of what the (big) buy-side of the street is intent on accomplishing for their portfolios.That input is used by the MMs’ arbitrageurs in negotiating hedging deals in the derivatives markets to protect the firm’s capital that usually gets involved in balancing buyer and seller appetites of the moment. It is that MM firm-capital price-protection insurance that reveals the knowledgeable expectations of coming securities prices.The subjects of this securities comparison are Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ:XLNX).All materials from blockdesk.com have been approved for this usage.Figure 1The Figure 1 table has two distinctive parts. The first 4 numeric data columns (B)-(E) are products of the analysis of current behavior of market professionals. Those columns and the one headed Range Index (G) report what that behavior implies about the current expectations of investment professionals for the likely range of stock or ETF prices in the coming 3-4 months.The remaining columns report what actual market price activity produced when prior forecasts for each stock similar to those of today were used to manage investments under a common portfolio discipline. The Range Index column tells what percentage of each stock’s current forecast lies below the current market price. Under the Sample Size column, heading a count of the number of prior forecasts with Range Indexes like today’s is indicated at (L), along with the total number of all forecasts available from the past 5 years of market days (M).Think about the credibility of the current forecasts in (E). The proportion of those similar prior forecasts that could produce a capital gain profit becomes a significant measure. It demonstrates the capability of the forecasters to be helpful to the wealth-building investor. Its proportion as a percent of the prior forecasts sample is in the column headed Win Odds (H).The Win Odds has an important impact on the Realized Payoff column (I) next to it, where the average NET gains of all the prior forecasts in the sample are reported. These results include the actual losses taken under our standard portfolio management discipline TERMD, applied to all forecast situations.TERMD sets the top of each implied price range forecast (B) as a sell target for that single forecast. When first reached within the next 3 months’ closing market price, that forecast position is closed so that the expanded capital can be immediately reinvested the following market day. If not reached in 3 months the position is closed and reinvested, regardless of gain or loss.The true Risk~Reward Tradeoff in each investment is between the upside forecast prospect of (E) to be pitted against actual prior worst-case downside price exposures experienced during TERMD holding periods. The flavor of the prospective reward carrot (E) gets muted by the worst-tasting next-column experience headed Maximum Drawdown (F).That point is viewed as the most likely high-stress point to cause an untimely termination of the adventure. A termination then would be at the least productive, most damaging point. This is real risk, the actual loss of capital, not what is conventionally offered as risk in much investment education theory – the potential worry over uncertainty of reward, the volatility of both higher and lower statistical deviation from some past average of price-change experiences.Instead, committing to the discipline’s full 3-month time investment (but not beyond) might achieve potential recovery to profitability (if/when at an interim price below entry cost), perhaps even to reach the forecast sell target.Between the target “cup” and the %Payoff “lip” serious adjustments to commitment enthusiasms can (and usually may) occur. They are indicated by the column headed Cred.Ratio (N) where the Realized Payoff accomplishment (I) is contrasted with the %Upside Sell Target offering (E).The more critical Reward~Risk comparison draws on the Win Odds (H) (and its complement 1 minus H as a %) to condition the Realized Payoff (I) and the Maximum Drawdown (F) as indicated in the Odds-Weighted columns (O) and (P).Figure 1’s rows provide all these important dimensions issue by issue for the securities in question. They are accompanied by similar boldfaced measures of SPY to give a taste of “the market” as most frequently observed by the investing public.Also are included comparisons of the subject stocks with a much broader population of over 2,700 stocks and ETFs as measured on this day. The population data often reveals overly optimistic sell targets and abysmal payoff results. In contrast, the population’s “top20” issues, ranked by their odds-weighted prior forecast histories, typically present annual rates of capital accumulation in the +75% to +90% range and even above.The wealth-building score is measured in Figure 1 by the portfolio’s compound annual growth rate (K), or CAGR. Each holding in a portfolio contributes its part, given the emphasis of capital commitment dedicated to it. Here each available candidate is viewed as having an equal participation prospect on an all or none basis at this point in time and opportunity.But CAGR is the meaningful standard. It makes the “speed” of wealth accumulation critical because the efficient use of time provides a non-financial leverage in attaining the portfolio’s goals. Recognizing that time presents a powerful (pun intended) function in the CAGR equation’s calculation, an understanding of each investment candidate’s time investment is important. In the financial community the “speed” of reward is measured in units of “basis points per day.” A basis point is 1/100th of one percent.Under the portfolio management discipline of TERMD, the holding period times of capital commitment to various positions may be quite uneven. This is in contrast to the usual methods of measurement for portfolio performance, looking at all holdings during equal calendar periods. That style of measurement tends to encourage buy and hold investing strategies, which result in grossly inefficient capital utilization when the significant leverage of time is considered.This kind of passive investment management behavior is a hang-over of 20th century investing economics when making holdings changes was quite expensive. At that time, serious opportunity for positive reward increments was required to justify the cost of making holdings changes. Payback periods measured in multiple months to years could often be encountered.Advances in transaction technologies now present paybacks of days to hours, with trends spurred by incentives among competing service providers.When measuring the attractiveness of investment candidates in a wealth-building mission environment, it makes sense to rank them by their demonstrated rates of capital accumulation. Figure 1 does that in their bp/day sequence, the last column on the right (R).The ranking tends to favor stocks with recent favorable experience and degrade those with extended unfavorable market history. The potential for demonstration of significant change in trend may encourage some overstaying positions or new investment choices with an investment losing its market-competitive edge. But it also impedes a too-eager repetition of falling-knife experiences where ultimate recovery may be reasonably expected.Those effects may make a sense of the trend of forecasts useful in the investor’s preferences of one security over another when choosing to make portfolio changes. Figures 2 and 3 provide the recent past 6 months’ daily trend of MM price range forecasts, along with the data from Figure 1, for NVDA and XLNX.Figure 2Note: This is not a conventional price history “chart.” It is a record of MM live-date forecasts of the stock’s near-term (3-4 coming months) range of likely prices. Forecasts made on the dates indicated, not after the fact. The vertical price-range forecast lines of Figure 1 are split into upside and downside prospects by the heavy-dot end-of-day market quote for the issue on the day of the forecast.A measure of the imbalance between up and down possible price change implications is the Range Index [RI], which tells what percentage proportion of the entire forecast range lies below the current price. The thumbnail picture at the bottom of Figure 1 presents the distribution of RIs for the stock seen in the past 5 years.Figure 3 Here are two stocks much alike in the way they are seen by the institutional component of the street’s buy side. The MM’s interpretation gives NVDA a bit higher potential price target, up almost +15% compared to XLNX’s +13%+. But their past achievements from prior forecasts like today’s are essentially identical, with resulting CAGRs different only by a round-off.XLNX shows a lower Range Index of 22, meaning that its forecast has 4 to 5 times as much upside, compared to NVDA’s RI of 40, an upside of only 2 ½ times its downside. But on an odds-weighted net return prospects for the two are pretty close to one another.At this level of potential bp/day reward they offer a shot at 6 to 7 times what a market-average SPY choice provides. They both are close enough to the “best-20” to perhaps be in its lower half.The current-day RI for XLNX remains on the generically strong (of coming-price trends) side of the RI distribution as shown in the small, “thumbnail” pictures at the bottom of each Figure. RI appearances on the right-hand side of the distribution may urge market to get prices temporarily up in the forecast range to Sell Target objectives but they are likely to decline from there.NVDA, on the other hand, is at a more frequent forecast circumstance. Not high enough to cause any concern, as indicated by the above discussion.The article’s title question provides more opportunity for examination than for decision; apologies. But some hair-splitting might favor XLNX in an investment capital commitment contest where no outside factors of portfolio existing content were present. NVDA is an able competitor here at present, regardless.Additional disclosure: Peter Way and generations of the Way Family are long-term providers of perspective information, earlier helping professional investors and now individual investors, discriminate between wealth-building opportunities in individual stocks and ETFs.

4212645,76975,2018-10-18T23:31:03-04:00,"Xilinx has unveiled its first ACAP chips.The new chips target the AI inference market, one that is expected to grow bigger than the AI training market that Nvidia currently dominates.Can Xilinx one day become a major data center player like Nvidia?","In September, Evercore ISI unveiled its ‘‘Magnificent 7’’ of semiconductor stocks. On the list were the usual suspects including Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron (MU) but also some unexpected ones like Xilinx Inc. (XLNX), the leader in field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) with a significant competitive technology lead and market share. FPGAs are integrated circuits that can be configured, albeit with difficulty, using software. Evercore says it picked Xilinx on the merit of its long-term data center upside, which was probably a bit prescient because a month later, Xilinx unveiled a highly innovative product - Everest.Xilinx has achieved considerable success in its core markets including wireless infrastructure, video, audio and broadcast equipment. But as new CEO Victor Peng likes to frequently remind the world, the company now considers data centers its largest area for growth and its #1 priority. In October, Xilinx unveiled Versal (stands for “versatile” and “universal’’), the first Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) chip code-named Everest.' Source: XilinxBuilt on Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSM) 7-nanometer FinFET process technology, Versal will combine software programmability with domain-specific hardware acceleration and high adaptability necessary for today’s rapid pace of innovation. The Versal portfolio consists of six devices uniquely architectured to deliver scalability and AI inference capabilities that can serve diverse application markets including cloud, networking, edge computing, wireless communications and endpoints. You can think of Versal as a SoC-like Swiss army knife device that integrates a CPU, GPU and FPGA for data center acceleration.Versal is in some ways similar to Xilinx’s Zynq Ultrascale+ MPSoC but with important additional features that can greatly simplify development and deployment due to the fact that the software has control over the system and also runs on a known configuration. Versal has shrunk the size of a central FPGA block to make room for extra DSP, ARM, inference and I/O blocks.The product’s timing seems perfect, coming at a time when Intel Corp. (INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are making room for bigger GPUs in their x86 chips as Nvidia adds extra cores for tasks such as deep learning.According to analyst Kevin Krewell of Tirias Research, Versal is Xilinx’s ‘‘effort to step up its game to be a peer of Intel and Nvidia.”In May, CEO Peng revealed to Data Center Dynamics that it took the company $1B in R&D, 1,500 engineers and four years to develop Everest. Obviously, that’s a huge budget for a company that spends ~$600M on R&D in a typical year. In the interview, he stressed how desperate he was for Xilinx to lose the ‘‘FPGA Company’’ tag or for Versal to simply be considered an FPGA upgrade for that matter.In fact, Peng says he wants Xilinx to be known as a ‘‘Data Center First’’ company. The company sees emerging trends such as AI and machine learning generating huge amounts of data that will need to be collected and analyzed while 5G networks will create a huge demand for its proprietary adaptive compute acceleration hardware. Interestingly, Xilinx makes some big claims saying Versal chips offer 4x the power efficiency of Nvidia’s leading GPUs and 2x-8x the inference benchmark performance while also being 43x-72x faster than Intel’s Xeon CPUs in handling inference workloads.Now that’s bold. About $600M or 20% of Nvidia’s revenue comes from AI-optimized data center hardware, up from near-zero a couple of years ago. Xilinx did not mince words when saying that its renewed focus was aimed at driving the same kind of success that Nvidia’s GPUs have been enjoying in the data center though he admitted that predicting a trajectory for the new business development is tough:Deep learning: Training vs. InferenceSource: NvidiaOnce shunned by the AI community and relegated into the technological trash heap as impractical due to its extreme computational intensity, deep learning now forms the very core of many AI applications. Deep learning breaks down complex tasks in a way that makes machine learning possible. Today, some machines trained for image recognition via deep learning can, in some cases, perform better than humans. Through the process of deep learning, Google’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) AlphaGo was able to tune its neural network by playing against itself over and over again and finally beat Ke Jie, the world's best Go player, 3-0 in a three-part match series in 2017.The process of deep learning is achieved in two phases: training and inference. Training a neural network involves inputting data into the system where individual neurons assign a weighting to the input (how correct or incorrect it is). Training is computational-intensive since the training algorithm does not tell the neural network what the right answer is but instead allows it to ‘‘guess’’ repeatedly until it’s able to pick the correct answer practically every time; e.g., the image is that of a cat or not.In the digital world, a trained neural network is put to work using what it has learned - tasks like recognizing spoken words, images, various diseases or suggesting what a customer is likely to buy next - in the form of a streamlined application. A completely weighted neural network is usually a clunky and massive database. The process of inference involves simplifying all the data, compressing and optimizing it for run-time performance. Tasks such as Google’s speech recognition, image search, malware detection, spam filtering and Netflix, Inc.’s (NFLX) recommendation engines all use some form of inference.Thanks to their parallel computing abilities (ability to handle multiple tasks at once), GPUs have been used for both AI training and inference. For inference tasks though, the performance goals of inference tasks are different from those by training tasks. Inference typically batches a smaller number of inputs than training, so as to minimize a network’s end-to-end response time. For instance, a cloud-based image-processing pipeline needs to have a high degree of responsiveness, so that users do not have to wait for minutes while the system accumulates images for a large batch. High throughput is therefore more important for training tasks while low latency is more critical for inference tasks. The low latency, low power and high frequency of AI inference workloads seem to fit the curve of reprogrammable hardware such as Versal perfectly.AI developers are likely to take advantage of the heterogeneous hardware and software-centric approach of Versal. The potential for a first-mover like Xilinx could be huge. Xilinx has shared industry projections from Barclays (NYSE:BCS) that show AI inference processing could grow bigger than AI training at the data center, which is what most Nvidia’s GPUs do. Edge and data center inference apps are what Xilinx is targeting with Versal, with TAM projections of nearly $23B in 2023 from zero currently.Source: XilinxOver the past two years, Xilinx has expanded its product portfolio from FPGAs to several SoCs and now ACAP. The company’s latest product seems perfectly timed as AI, 5G and IoT get ready to really take off. Maybe a couple of years from now, investors will look back at this pivotal moment as one that transformed Xilinx from a mere FPGA company to a major data center player just like Nvidia.Xilinx has thrown down the gauntlet, and you can expect Nvidia to respond. The stakes are too high, if those Barclays/Xilinx estimates of AI inference market are anywhere in the ballpark. There are rumors that Broadcom Ltd. (AVGO) might turn its M&A attention to Xilinx after Trump squashed a Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM) takeover. Nvidia has in the past mostly focused its M&A game on the graphics and gaming industries. Maybe this time it will borrow a leaf from Intel’s playbook and buy Xilinx?Long both Xilinx and Nvidia."
4215315,76975,2018-10-29T05:45:43-04:00,Xilinx has delivered stellar Q2 earnings.Most of the company's key segments recorded strong growth.The pivotal Data Center segment was impressive.Xilinx's ongoing successful transformation into a ''Data Center First'' company makes it a solid long-term semi play.,"It’s been a rough week for the semiconductor sector after a spate of disappointing earnings from GPU and embedded processor bellwethers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Texas Instruments (TXN), STMicroelectronics (STM) and MKS Instruments (MKSI) to name a few. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (SOXX) has closed down a whopping 7% and is now deeply in the red in the year-to-date.There have been a few exceptions though; most notably, FPGA maker Xilinx Inc. (XLNX) which not only managed to print strong earnings but also provided upbeat guidance. XLNX's shares have surged 15% after the company reported revenue of $746M (+19% Y/Y beat by $35.69M), a quarterly record and one of the fastest growth clips in the company’s history. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.87 represented 30% Y/Y growth and exceeded Wall Street’s consensus of $0.11.Meanwhile, Q3 guidance was equally impressive: revenue in the $760M-$780M range (consensus: $719.94M) while FY19 guidance has revenue at $2.95 to $3B (consensus: $2.85B).I had discussed the disruptive potential of the company’s latest chip, Versal, in an earlier article. I was, however, pleasantly surprised that many of the company’s older product lines are showing strong growth, too.Source: CNN MoneyWhat impressed me most about the company’s latest results was the broad based growth recorded across key segments and diverse markets. The Communications segment, the company’s largest, recorded the strongest growth at 34% Y/Y, mainly driven by LTE upgrades as well as early pre-5G/5G deployments. The wireless business recorded brisk growth thanks to customer transitions to next generation products such as OTN metro especially in China (Asia-Pacific is Xilinx’s largest market).A lot of that growth hinged on the popularity of the company’s Zynq RFSoCs. These are special chips that integrate the software programmability of ARM-based processors with the hardware programmability of Xilinx’s FPGAs. Zynq RFSoCs integrate CPUs, DSPs, ASSPs and mixed signal functionality on a single device. The Zynq-7000 family provides an open design environment that facilitates parallel development for custom accelerators and dual-core Cortex-A9 processor-based systems that developers can use to accelerate time to market.According to CEO Victor Peng, Zynq uptake was weak when it launched in March 2011 mainly due to software limitations. But the chips are now being applied across multiple use cases including communication, industrial and automotive (driver-assist systems) end markets. Zynq sales grew a robust 70% Y/Y last term and now account for 18% of the company’s sales. That’s 4x the prior quarter’s growth clip, indicating a very steep ramp. The good thing is that the company projects even more growth ahead.Xilinx has re-branded itself from a narrow FPGA maker to a ""Data Center First"" platform vendor whose adaptable intelligence products can be used by businesses to negotiate the rapid changes being spawned by secular trends such as AI, machine learning, big data, mobility and IoT. Quite naturally, the company talked up its Data Center and TME (Test, Measurement & Emulation) opportunities a lot.Data Center and TME segment revenue was up 25.5% Y/Y to $156.7M driven by the company’s burgeoning FAAS (FPGA-as-a-Service) platform. Notably, Alibaba (BABA) and Huawei escalated their FAAS cloud platforms from beta to general access. Meanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) doubled its FAAS availability to eight zones after adding Frankfurt, Sydney, London and China. Other FAAS wins by the company include Baidu (BIDU) and Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY).Peng also discussed the potential of the company’s new Alveo cards that it has co-developed with AMD. Alveo is a PCIe accelerator card that’s powered by Xilinx’s UltraScale+ programmable silicon. The cards are meant for data centers where they can be used to accelerate modern workloads including machine learning inference, data analytics and video processing. Alveo has an inference throughput of 30,000 images per second and latency of 2 milliseconds. That’s about 3x lower latency and 4x higher throughput than high-end GPUs.Xilinx says it’s talking to several OEMs, including EMC, Dell, Fujitsu, IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, to qualify Alveo chips for data centers. Alveo started shipping in late Q2 and the company expects production to ramp meaningfully over the next 12 months.Source: Tom's HardwareXilinx, however, did not mince words regarding which product is closest to its heart — Versal, terming it the most profound recent milestone. Built on ACAP (Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform), Xilinx has projected that Versal will accelerate a very broad range of applications especially AI inference. AI inference is a phrase that Peng used repeatedly during the earnings call, signaling it’s an opportunity the company is targeting. In my latest Xilinx article, I discussed how Barclays has predicted that AI inference will grow to be much bigger than the AI training market that Nvidia (NVDA) currently serves with GPUs.The company says it remains on track to tape out the first 7nm Versal product by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) later during the current quarter and go into silicon during the second half of 2019.Xilinx has projected a robust 67% CAGR for its data center SAM (Serviceable Available Market) to reach $4.6B by 2022.The semiconductor selloff has made it harder to pick quality companies with significant multi-year growth runways. Xilinx, however, seems to make the cut as it continues to demonstrate that its transformation to a data center first company is actually working. What’s particularly remarkable about the company’s innovation DNA is that nearly two-thirds of revenue now comes from newer products like Zynq instead of legacy ones like Virtex.Meanwhile, the company’s gross margins have not only remained strong (69% last term) but have also been constantly improving, proof that it remains a leader in the markets it serves.Xilinx has projected 13% CAGR for total SAM through 2022, led by 30% CAGR by the pivotal Data Center and TME segment. With earnings projected to grow at 14.2% CAGR over the next five years, XLNX's stock remains a top long-term semi play."
4219717,101848,2018-11-08T02:27:57-05:00,"Since Xilinx's 3rd quarter earnings report last month, the stock has managed a 22% surge on demand for its programmable FPGA chip and Zynq platform.Xilinx got a big earnings boost by edging out long-time Microsoft supplier Intel to provide FPGA chips to the company's Azure cloud unit.As demand for its products soar, Xilinx remains vulnerable to US-China trade tensions as a growing number of countries ponder bans on technology sales to and from Chinese tech companies.","Xilinx (XLNX), in a most unlikely coup, recently edged out long-time Microsoft (MSFT) supplier Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to supply field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) to the former’s Azure cloud unit. Azure is projected to use Xilinx FPGAs in about half of its servers, a contract that has been the exclusive domain of Intel’s Altera unit. FPGAs are used in big data applications to enhance the speed and minimize the time spent in the breakdown and analysis of vast bodies of data. Big data companies like Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Facebook (FB), Microsoft and video streaming companies like Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS) have become voracious consumers of FPGAs for their servers in data centers across the country and around the world. So have private companies using satellites to track the flow of dry goods and oil shipments on the open seas or the crunching and interpreting the infinitesimal minutia of real-time data that enables driverless cars, trucks and airplanes or wireless communications or advanced radar or robotics or the myriad other applications of artificial intelligence (AI) both known and yet to be discovered. Government run the gamut from tracking and predicting weather events to enforcing North Korean, and now Iranian, sanction compliance to tracking and interpreting topography that powers guidance systems for an ever increasing array of civilian and defense applications. The common thread here is the systematic digestion and synthesis of massive quantities of data squeezed into sophisticated algorithmic models capable, for example, of discerning the length of a vessel’s shadow and its height in the water from geosynchronous satellites scanning what was once almost infinite spans of oceanic topography—all at minimum cost over the course of minutes, and often in real time. Little wonder why traditional theories on price inflation or, for that matter, computations of gross domestic output and even worker productivity in the greater economy—all likely fall short in measuring contemporary, digitized data.Figure 1: Xilinx and the S&P 500 against the Philadelphia Semiconductor IndexAfter the market close on the 24th of October and in the midst of an overall market swoon, Xilinx (green-red bars) reported its 3rd quarter earnings which saw revenues hit $746 million, up 19% YOY with gross margins posting $515 million, up 17%—more than two times expected S&P 500 revenue expectations for the 3rd quarter reporting season. Operating income, at $233 million rose 21% for the period while net income hit 216 million, up 24% YOY—all of which drove EPS up 30% YOY. By the market close on the 25th, the company’s stock had shot up 15% and through its 20-day exponential trading average (blue line) while the S&P 500 (black dotted line) headed in a more southerly direction. By Wednesday’s close (7 November), Xilinx was up just over 22% since its 3rd quarter earnings report. Year-to-date, Xilinx is up just over 25% against the Nasdaq’s Wednesday close of 8% and the S&P 500’s close of 4% over the same period. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index (green area) is still negative for the year (see Figure 1, above).Most of the company’s revenue comes from its semiconductor segment with related support products, broadly categorized as advanced and core products. The former category comprises 64% to total revenue and was up over 25% on the quarter and 43% on the year with revenues, settling at $479.7 million, exceeding the high end of the company's 2nd quarter guidance. The company’s new 28- and 60-nanometer Zynq product lines grew 70% YOY and contributed 18% of total revenue through the period. Similar growth patterns are projected as demand for programmable end-use chip designs increase as AI and big data applications multiply in the intermediate term and beyond.Core products provided the remaining 36% of company revenue for the period. Core products, by their very nature in the cycle, tend to be older more mature technologies and product support packages, such as the company’s Virtex product lines, that are expected to decline over time. Through the end of the quarter, Core product revenue declined 9% YOY to $266.6 million.Advanced products are further broken down by end markets: 1) Data Center and Test, Measurement & Emulation (TME), 2) Automotive, Broadcast and Consumer, 3) Communications, 4) Industrial, Aerospace and Defense and 5) Channel. The quarter’s top performing segments are three in number.The communications segment rose 33% YOY, contributing $261.2 million or just over 35% of total revenue through the end of the quarter. The growth was broadly spread across end markets, with particularly strong growth coming from LTE upgrades and early 5G roll-outs in South Korea, China and North America. Zynq RFSoC products soared fourfold YOY with double digit growth potential from an already established body of unique and potential users across multiple industrial moving forward. The RFSoC platform was also used in the live broadcast of the 2018 World Cup from Moscow, providing enhanced and accelerated bandwidth streaming over more traditional LTE bands.Data Center and TME surged 28% over the period. One driver of the growth is the company’s Alveo accelerator cards designed to significantly increase server performance in cloud and data center applications. Inspur, a Hong Kong-based cloud and data center provider, is currently qualifying two Alevo cards for its server platforms. At the same time, Amazon Web Services (AWS) recently increased its FPGA-as-a-service (FaaS) availability from four to eight regions, adding Australia, London, Frankfurt and most recently China to its list of 18 geographic regions across the globe. AWS is the world’s largest cloud computing service. Additionally, Alibaba, Huawei and ZTE along with AWS are leveraging Xilinx technology to improve and enhance cloud computing and data center workloads in China.Revenues from the company’s Automotive, Broadcast and Consumer segment was up 17% YOY, driven by advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) that provides real-time, high resolution, long-range visual sensors for autonomous driving, UAVs and robotics. The technology combines the Zynq SoC Chip with the parallel computational capability of FPGA with ARM processors that provides a flexibility that can be programmed to a particular application even after the chips have been shipped to an end user. Ever-changing technology demands require greater programmable flexibility, which makes the growth potential of such designs all the more robust in the intermediate term and beyond.All of this said, the biggest impediment to forward growth Xilinx faces over the intermediate term comes not from the technology—but from the political side of the equation, that continues to grow more xenophobic as US-Chinese trade tensions intensify. In April, Britain and the US both banned ZTE, China’s biggest telecom equipment maker on national security grounds. The ban cut off the company entirely from the UK while the US banned the company for seven years for violating a 2017 settlement that accused the company of selling restricted telecom equipment containing US component parts to Iran and North Korea. The ban was lifted in July at the behest of the Trump administration, over the objections of Republican senators. Xilinx has now resumed its shipments to ZTE.More recently, the UK’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) in a letter last month warned the country’s telecom companies to evaluate their supply chains carefully as they begin to roll-out their 5G networks. This time Huawei, the Chinese telecom equipment maker, was the unmentioned target—again on national security grounds. Huawei is one of the world’s biggest producers of telecom equipment and currently is a major supplier of broadband and seller of mobile devices in Britain. The review will be conducted by the UK’s Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and will more than likely delay the introduction of 5G networks slated for roll-out in the 2019-20 timeframe. Both the US and Australia have blocked Chinese telecom suppliers to their respective 5G breakout and Japan is considering similar bans.How Xilinx navigates the political end of their otherwise strong growth story remains to be told."
4206903,104439,2018-09-18T10:51:57-04:00,"Xilinx has demonstrated higher profitability than peers for a good period of time.Key developments in a number of fronts indicate that the firm's guidance is economically attainable.Although dividend yield is not satisfactory, price return made up for it.My valuation shows that it is overvalued by roughly $10 a share; as a result, the recommendation is a hold.","Xilinx (XLNX) is an established name in circuitry. Besides superior bottom line and cash flows compared to peers, Xilinx has posted nice sales growth for last two years. In its latest quarter, the firm has posted 13% yoy and projected yearly guidance to $2.8 billion to $2.9 billion which represents roughly 10.28% to 14.22% expected growth. Given the firm's recent development on key design wins from data centers, acquisition of DeePhi tech and collaboration with Daimler (OTCPK:DMLRY) to build custom AI inference platform for their future vehicles, the projections look economically feasible. However, both my DCF model and relative value analysis show that Xilinx is overvalued, the market is pricing enormous growth because of the firm's superior financial performance. Based on current situation, I see a 25% upside on Xilinx for a one-year investment horizon, representing a target price of $96.96. But I expect its current price to at least partially converge to its intrinsic value, which according to my model is $67.56, indicating a $10.01 mispricing at the time of writing this article (Xilinx trading at $77.57). As a result, I would recommend hold and suggest that interested investors buy at better levels as suggested by my valuation.Source: SeekingAlphaInvestigation of industry performance for last seven years shows that Xilinx has consistently kept profitability beyond peer average. The peers for my study include Analog Devices, Marvell Technology, Maxim Integrated, Texas Instruments, ON Semiconductor, and Applied Materials. Average profit margin spread over peer average has been 9.65% for Xilinx, which is substantially attractive. Moreover, capital expenditure to sales compared to peers have been 1.4% lower, indicating more efficient use of capital. A look away from accounting income also indicates that the firm is in good health, as indicated by its net income to operating cash flow ratio of 0.74 on average, which is 0.22 higher compared to peers. These figures are some of the primary reasons why the market is pricing supreme growth for the firm, currently, Xilinx is trading at a P/E of $37.29, roughly 12.82 higher than the industry average. Besides benefitting stockholders with price returns, dividends have posted a five-year growth rate of 10.24%. While the dividend yield might not be that satisfactory when considered alone, combining it with rapid price growth gives it a pretty sweet spot.Data source: Stockrow, data processed by the author.Xilinx has roughly $2.8 billion of fixed income securities in its investment portfolio and approximately $1.75 billion of debt, exposing it to interest rate risk and credit risk. To manage credit risk, Xilinx has invested more than 91% of its investment portfolio in AA or higher rated securities by Moody's and S&P. As of March 31, 2018, approximately 24% of the portfolio consisted of mortgage-backed securities. All of the mortgage-backed securities in the investment portfolio were issued by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and agencies and are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor's and Aaa by Moody's Investors Service. The firm in its 10-K says that a hypothetical 100 basis point (one percentage point) increase or decrease in interest rates compared to rates at March 31, 2018, would have affected the fair value of its investment portfolio by approximately $40.0 million. The $1.75 billion of debt currently funds roughly 34.7% of Xilinx's total asset mix and currently holds A3 issuer rating by Moody's. As Xilinx's sales are dispersed into North America (30%), Asia Pacific (41%), Europe (20%), and Japan (9%), the firm engages in derivative instruments to manage foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk. As of March 31, 2018, Xilinx had $146.65 million held in foreign currency exchange contracts. Because of currency involvement in the FX contracts, the impact of adverse moves cannot be transparently measurable.Now let's turn to valuation. In order to arrive at an intrinsic price of $67.56, I have assumed 15% revenue growth as projected by the management and decreased it linearly by a percentage every year, bringing it down to 11% in the terminal year (2023). Operating margin expectations are in line with historical averages, ranging in between 29.97-30.1%. In order to calculate weighted average cost of capital, I have made multiple assumptions regarding equity risk premium, expected beta, and yield spreads. I am confident that these assumptions reflect the underlying economics of the firm. The relative value shows that Xilinx is overpriced in terms of all the valuation multiples, with the most pronounced effect in P/E. Since I expect it to converge at least partially towards its intrinsic price, I would recommend to buy it at better levels. But if you are in, then let's hold on.DCF summary (table in the notes section)Xilinx has demonstrated great potential for high growth portfolios. Efficiency is high across a wide spectrum of metrics and consistency is found in its performance. With the ongoing developments in data center and automotive segments, I believe that Xilinx will be able to achieve its fifteen percent revenue growth guidance. Because operating margin is retained at levels of 29-31% for a long period of time, I expect it to be near one standard deviation of the ranges given absence of material adverse catalyst. Although dividend yield is not satisfactory on a standalone basis, combining it with price returns make it an ideal stock for high growth investors. But currently, my model shows that it is overvalued; as a result, I recommend hold. You can buy if it converges towards the intrinsic value, which is $67.56 according to my model.Notes"
4166877,24757,2018-04-27T12:26:36-04:00,"ACAP or Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform was announced.
        The first chips could be sampling in early 2019.
        ACAP could replace many existing chips and create new applications.","Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) is best known for FPGA semiconductor chips. FPGAs have had a narrower field of use than the CPUs, GPUs, and memory chips that are more familiar to most investors. A new initiative, ACAP, is likely to greatly expand the use of Xilinx chips, and hence revenue and profits. I believe it is smart to get in now, even though the revenue ramp will not be significant until 2020.As the transistor sizes on silicon chips shrink it becomes possible to put more and more transistors on a chip. This means over time it has become possible to put more functions on a chip, like AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) combination of a CPU and GPU on its single APU chips.ACAP (Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform) combines multiple FPGA, memory, DSP (digital signal processing), CPU, and ""software programmable, yet hardware adaptable, compute engines"" on a single chip connected by an on-chip network (per Xilinx ACAP press release).In performing a given compute task, the allocation of space on the chip to these various engines, and their ability to feed each other processed data, is of critical importance. We don't have information on the specific design of this new generation of chips yet, but they will be on the cutting-edge 7 nm process node.Given different potential uses from communications to AI, a variety of peripherals will be available on variants of the chips, including analog-digital converters and programmable memory controllers.Xilinx believes ""The adoption of ACAP products in the data center, as well as in our broad markets, will accelerate the pervasive use of adaptive computing, making the intelligent, connected, and adaptable world a reality sooner.""Some tasks currently take very long periods of time, even hours or days, to do on today's fastest FPGAs, CPUs and GPUs. The first generation ACAP chips, Everest, is expected to be 20 times faster processing neural networks than the current Xilinx product, the Virtex VU9P FPGA.For 5G cellular applications, Everest will enable a 4x increase in bandwidth vs. current chips.If we are to see self-driving automobiles that are not death traps, they may be enabled by ACAP's superior ability to quickly analyze data and make safe decisions.ACAP could even help the current biotech revolution continue to make advances. It should greatly speed up genetic sequencing analysis. It can also accelerate the design of molecules for novel medicines.There is a lot of competition in the space for devices running artificial intelligence, machine learning, and neural network code right now. ACAP will have to muscle its way into the market, and rivals may come out with similar devices. The most likely competitor is Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), which bought Xilinx's old rival, Altera in 2015, and so has expertise in CPUs, FPGAs, GPUs, as well as the ability to invest heavily in R&D. Another rival would be Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has done very well adapting its GPUs to the new paradigm and has experience with ARM processors, but which does not have FPGA expertise.Current generation Xilinx Virtex chip. Source: Xilinx.comSoftware is important to competition as well. Nvidia beat AMD in the GPU acceleration for databases space largely because its CUDA software made development relatively easy. Xilinx is putting a lot of resources into making its current generation of database accelerators and ACAP easier to program. ""Software developers will be able to target ACAP-based systems using tools like C/C++, OpenCL and Python. An ACAP can also be programmable at the RTL level using FPGA tools.""GAAP trailing 12-month P/E for Xilinx is 25.3 (with shares at $64.50). That is above the market average. It is arguable that this high P/E already reflects the recent growth rate and a reasonable projection for future growth. It is above my rule-of-thumb P/E of 20 for companies with moderate growth rates.In Q1 2018 (reported April 25, 2018) Xilinx reported revenue of $673 million, up 10% y/y. That is good growth but would seem to put the price of the stock at the upper end of what I regard as fairly valued.The main factor affecting the stock price, for now, is the anticipation of the rollout of 5G telecommunications equipment. Xilinx chips are used in cell tower stations. Those being sold (in its Broadcast category) right now are for 4G or in some cases for legacy 3G buildouts of infrastructure. This particular business comes in waves of a few years duration. Most likely this category will begin to ramp again in 2019 as the earliest 5G deployments are tested. Given the Xilinx competitive edge, you can count on (baring the usual caveats) a large ramp in revenue in 2020 as 5G deployments ramp up in a big way.I think that anticipation is why the P/E is currently around 25.But I do not think the market is anticipating ACAP revenue and profit yet. If earnings go up, and the P/E remains stable, the stock will go up, but we could also see a boost if the P/E itself goes up as investors see the potential new ACAP earnings coming in over the horizon.Putting a number on ACAP revenue is probably not a good idea at this time, as it would be just a guess. It would not have to be a very big number compared to Intel, Nvidia, or AMD to catapult Xilinx into a more prominent role in the semiconductor industry.With the first ACAP Everest chips ready for tape out in 2018, customers should get samples in 2019. It will take them time to design chips into new devices. Some industries, like automotive, have long lead times between design and buying chips in volume. But I would expect some significant revenue in 2020, and a ramp extending clear into the next decade.Given the time frame, this is an idea for long-term investors. There are too many reasons for volatility in the interim to make it a good short-term idea, at least until we see the chips and get confirmation from customers that they will use them in large volumes."
4140024,103480,2018-01-25T08:58:21-05:00,"Xilinx, the chipmaker best known for its programmable logic devices, posted strong Q3 earnings that beat analyst consensus.
        The company's Q4 guidance also showed meaningful upside relative to Wall Street expectations.
        While growth in the quarter (8%) was tepid, it's the company's ninth consecutive growth quarter as Advanced Products grew 30%, especially the company's smallest 16nm form factor.
        Relative to memory stocks in the semiconductor industry, however, Xilinx is still overvalued and is likely to underperform in 2018.","In a strong early kickoff to semiconductor earnings, Xilinx (NASDAQ: XLNX), the San Jose-based maker of programmable logic devices (PLDs, which controls the digital circuits that can be programmed for various tasks), posted Q3 earnings that beat top-line revenue estimates, though bottom-line figures are noisy due to a tax charge related to the new tax law enactment.As most investors know, the chip sector has been the hottest-performing sub-sector in technology (as well as the entire market) in the past twelve months. The iShares PHLX Semiconductor index (NYSE: SOXX), the most popular tracker for the chip sector, is up nearly 50% y/y. Most of this growth has been attributed to the most cyclical names of the chip industry, such as storage company Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU), as storage chipmakers benefit from global supply tightness, resulting in price spikes in DRAM (and to a lesser extent, NAND).The drama has been a bit less pronounced in the logic space, which Xilinx and Altera (through its parent Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)) have dominated for years. With logic devices more or less immune to the tempestuous price swings seen in memory chips, Xilinx's financials have been a bit more stable, if unexciting, relative to memory stocks like Micron which have seen almost 2x revenue growth and many multiples higher of earnings growth. The key question for investors now is: with widespread expectations that memory production will ramp this year and cause DRAM pricing to cool down in 2018 (NAND pricing already has), is it time to rotate out of votive memory stocks and into more stable semiconductor names to gain a more balanced, ""safe"" exposure to the chip sector?Xilinx's strong earnings certainly presents an investment case in the company, whose stock performance has lagged behind memory peers as well as the broader SOXX (despite performing well above the S&P500). That doesn't mean it's more of a value play relative to other chip stocks, however. Xilinx's ~30x forward P/E is substantially higher than the likes of Micron and Western Digital (NASDAQ: MU). Even when considering that the latter two have earnings multiples based on their ""peak cycle"" earnings, the gap between 30x P/E and low single digits is still far too wide to make a compelling case for Xilinx. My take on the current landscape - is Xilinx safer than its more volatile (no pun intended) memory cousins? Absolutely. Xilinx's moderate trailing-twelve months stock performance probably leaves some room for upside in 2018. But it would be a mistake to completely let go of the higher-risk, higher-reward stocks like Western Digital which are still trading at a huge discount to earnings. There are early signals, especially from SK Hynix's recent earnings, that the memory supercycle still has legs and that memory stocks will continue to outperform Xilinx. Xilinx posted $631.2 million in revenues in Q3, +7.8% y/y and beating analyst consensus of $630.0 million (+7.5% y/y) by just a hair. While the company does rightfully claim that it's succeeded in growing for nine consecutive quarters, its marginal beat to consensus seems too thin to justify the ~5% aftermarket reaction.See the company's summary results in the chart below:Figure 1. Xilinx Q3 resultsSource: Xilinx investor relationsXilinx's Advanced Products segment - which consists of its higher-end, smaller form (in the chip sector, small is the essence of quality) UltraScale+ and Ultrascale lines - grew 30% y/y, as continual technology shifts into compressing internal hardware drive demand for its 16nm and 20nm technologies. Its older Core Products segment, however, fell 12% y/y as the technology phases out.Xilinx also presented its growth rates by end market, which can draw some interesting conclusions:Figure 2. Xilinx Q3 revenue split by end marketMost enterprise technology companies have reported strength in data center products in their most recent earnings, driven by continued buildouts of cloud computing infrastructure. A -12% y/y decline in communications and data center sales - which used to be Xilinx's largest end market - does cause some degree of concern. Consumer and automotive end markets, after all, are noxiously cyclical, and if growth in Xilinx's more ""stable"" customer segments can't keep up, the company may have to cut its growth streak short.On the plus side, however, Xilinx improved its already-high gross margins in the quarter. Q3 gross margins expanded to 71.1% in the quarter, up from 69.6% in the year-ago third quarter.Cash flow was another standout in the quarter:Figure 3. Xilinx Q3 cash flow resultsOperating cash flow in the quarter grew 75% y/y to $184.7 million; netting out $6.8 million of capex, the company also generated $177.9 million of free cash flow. That's up ~2x from 3Q16's FCF of $85.7 million. Note, though, that Xilinx's strong cash flow results are already more or less baked into its valuation, with the stock trading at a fair multiple of 24x FCF:GAAP earnings in the quarter were, as previously mentioned, slightly noisy due to the effects of the tax law enactment. The company reported $11.9 million of net income, impacted by $183 million in non-recurring tax expense. Barring this unusual tax noise, the company would have generated roughly $195 million in net income, up ~38% y/y over 3Q16 and translating roughly to diluted pro forma EPS of $0.75, above the $0.63 that analysts were calling for.Xilinx's Q4 guidance also didn't fail to impress: the company pointed to $635-$665 million in revenues, beating consensus of $634.4 million. The wrap-up from the quarter: yes, Xilinx is performing well, with continued top-line growth feeding into strong cash flow results and EPS (barring the one-time tax expenses). But compared to the broader chip sector, Xilinx's revenue and earnings expansion pales in comparison to its more volatile peers in the memory industry. And while Xilinx's turf is more immune to the temperamental fluctuations in component pricing, slight cracks are beginning to show - certainly, the drop in datacenter revenues against the backdrop of a strong IT/cloud computing space isn't pleasant to see.The takeaway on Xilinx: it's a hold, at best. Guidance was good, but the quarter's minor beats to top-line Wall Street expectations probably don't merit a ~5% upside in after-hours trading, especially when the stock is already trading at a more expensive multiple relative to other semiconductor stocks."

Amazon EC2 F1 instances provide re-configurable, custom-hardware acceleration with 16nm Virtex UltraScale+ FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays) made by Xilinx.FPGAs are fast emerging as handy parallel processing chips with better scope for hardware acceleration and customization through software programming compared to GPUs. In this light, Xilinx offers a good investing opportunity for medium- to long-term investors. Image Source: Silicon Valley Business JournalWith the sphere of cloud computing continuing to expand, the landscape for parallel-processing intensive workloads, such as machine learning, video processing, and related HPC (high-performance computing) kind of workloads, will expand. Although it’s true that GPUs perform these tasks efficiently, the problem with GPUs is that you can’t readily customize these parallel processing accelerators. In addition, without having an HPC environment it would be difficult for a vast majority of developers to participate in the AI (artificial intelligence) bandwagon.In the initial phase of FPGAs, they were not suitable for running software algorithms, and therefore they were made as standalone hardware chips to represent hardware implementations of algorithms. FPGAs were popular those days due to the fact that hardware was faster than software. Later on, GPUs came into the scenario with their ability to run software algorithms. Despite the fact that hardware was faster than software, the massive parallel processing power of GPUs made them popular alternatives of FPGAs.However, with the latest evolution of FPGAs as programmable parallel processing chips, they are fast becoming strong competitors of GPUs. Most of today’s workloads are driven by AI and since these workloads need higher degree of customization (naturally, when you’re replicating human intelligence, you need higher degree of customization because as humans we all are different), the rebirth of FPGAs is a significant milestone in the semiconductor industry.A research conducted by Dr. Eriko Nurvitadhi from Intel (INTC) Accelerator Architecture Lab (AAL) and his team evaluated the performance of Intel’s FPGAs to run DNN (deep neural network) algorithms against Nvidia’s (NVDA) Titan X Pascal GPUs. Dr. Randy Huang, one of the eminent FPGA architects of the research team, said:This conclusion is supported by the fact that AWS is now offering Amazon EC2 F1 instances, as mentioned in the beginning of the article. EC2 F1 is a new type of compute instance which offers fully customizable FPGAs for developing and deploying hardware acceleration in the cloud. This is actually FPGA-as-a-Service. F1 instances enable developers to access custom FPGA hardware and speed up 30x application performance over general purpose CPUs, which in turn result in reduced costs and time to develop applications required for tomorrow’s neural networks.Xilinx is available at a P/E multiple of close to 30x and P/S multiple of just above 7x. The company’s 16nm UltraScale+ advanced FPGAs are driving its revenue growth at present. The 16nm products are growing at a high single digit rate of 8%, per the company’s Q1 2018 earnings call.Although the company hasn’t delivered consistent annual revenue growth yet, in the last three quarters its revenue grew successively, which I believe could be the start of consistent growth. The basis of my belief is the availability of the company’s SDAccel development platform on AWS cloud, which supports software-driven hardware acceleration written in C, C++ and OpenCL.In addition, I believe the company’s management is shareholder-friendly. The management has been able to maintain net cash of $2 billion post-debt in Q1 2018 on the balance sheet and paid $82 million in dividends, alongside nearly 1 million share buybacks for $67 million at an average price of $65.09.In the last four quarters, the company’s revenue totaled $2.39 billion. I expect the company’s revenue will grow at a CAGR of mid-to-high single digit, say 7.5%, in the next three years. Based on the expectation and the fact that FPGAs will see growing adoption, I would like to attach a P/S multiple of 10-12x on the company’s stock price, which can drive the stock well above $100 in the next one year.The upcoming 5G wireless network, where AI-based software-defined virtual environment will play a major role, will drive the adoption of FPGAs significantly. The availability of FPGA-as-a-Service via cloud will be the catalyst to drive the price of Xilinx stock higher. The GPU-as-a-Service concept failed to entice enterprises because of the almost saturated installed-base of GPUs in most of the datacenters across the world.The good news for FPGAs is that it arrived at the marketplace in its new form a bit later. However, the timing was perfect, when the market for machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) just began to expand. Therefore, it won’t be unwise to expect that FPGA-as-a-Service will attract small- to medium-sized enterprises towards itself. Xilinx management knows this very well. Therefore, it bought back shares at an average price of $65 a few months ago."
4100021,21815,2017-08-18T07:16:50-04:00,"Solid mid single-digit revenue growth, combined with double-digit EPS growth and a good dividend yield.A solid and financially very sound company that is fairly valued.More excitement is on the way, but not just yet.","Xilinx (XLNX) has broadened from being just a supplier of FPGA (field programmable gate array) chips. FPGAs have a wide applicability, for a brief introduction into FPGAs and a list of applications see here.Xilinx has three divisions (per 10-Q):One of the more promising applications is in 5G, which is in the early trial phase (real deployment will only start in earnest from 2019-2020 onwards) but Xilinx RFSoC is capturing a substantial part of the early trials and mobile revenue was up substantially for the quarter.In the automotive market, they have moved from infotainment to ADAS (advanced driver assistance systems) and they are generating revenues with their 28nm Zynq product, approaching 100 models from 25 different manufacturers. Revenues are increasing here quite rapidly; it's now generating 7% of their overall revenues (used to be 4-5%).They are transiting to a 16nm MPSoC and one of the selling points they have is security with the overral target to move to 7nm ""with more of a focus on the other elements as opposed to the supercomputer at the center of it all."" (per Q1CC).It's at the datacenter market that things are getting really interesting. The company justly touts the development and cooperation with Amazon's (AMZN) FPGA as a service F1 platform. Open for use since April this year, it's first targeted at hardware FPGA designers.This is still in the early phase, with adjustments in performance and usability still ongoing, but given the heft of Amazon, this could really take off in a major way.The company argues that there are 7 hyperscalers and two significant systems companies that are very close customers and partners and Xilinx is already working with all of them.While it counts on Amazon to take the bulk of the tens of millions of dollars in revenues it predicted from this sector some time ago, management has high hopes of convincing at least some of these of the benefits of FPGA as a service, from the Q1CC:Initially, the Amazon deployment was based on Vivado, but what will be rolled out next month is based on SDAccel (software defined accelerator), which management believes is a unique company capability, from the Q1CCSome technical background here, and here (our emphasis):But before you get too excited, it does require additional efforts from the company in terms of sales and services and the guidance for the communication and datacenter segment is still just 1% to 4% year-on-year growth, so this will not be an immediate take-off.But they see the AWS platform not only as a potentially very substantial revenue generator, but also as a learning platform that generates knowledge that can be applied elsewhere.Sales will be between $605M and $635M in Q2, with gross margins between 69% and 71% and EPS between 55 and 69 cents. R&D was 25% of revenues and will temporarily grow for a couple of quarters, putting a little downward pressure on earnings. Consensus for $617 million and 61 cents.Margins have been fairly constant the last 3 years or so, after experiencing some expansion earlier in the decade.The shares aren't cheap:Analysts expect $2.58 per share this year rising to $2.8 in FY2019, which would put the shares on a forward multiple of 22.They also seem to be struggling a bit, moving towards the 200-day moving average.Xilinx is a solid and financially sound company. It has several good growth opportunities, most notably in the cloud and a little later also with 5G. In the meantime, the company produces mid single-digit revenue growth and earnings growth that is a little faster, as well as a good dividend (2.32%).On these metrics, the stock seems fairly valued to us, which is why it requires quite a bit of patience for the new growth opportunities to start kicking in."

(XLNX) seem to show mixed signals that have created confusion among minority investors. On one hand, there are cuts in the company's estimates, as a significant drop is expected in the semiconductor industry, while other firms have increased the target price of Xilinx's shares and restated their buying recommendation.Looking closely at the reasons for these decisions, we see that these recommendations are based on different time horizons, with short-term catalysts against long-term ones. Although it is estimated that the semiconductor industry will suffer a ""soft landing"" sometime soon, we believe that this difficulty will be quickly compensated for by medium- and long-term trends.Source: Extracted from aithority.By defining better the fears that weigh in the semiconductor industry, we see that many of these fears are linked to the memory segment, both DRAM and NAND, as the increase in inventories and rising pricing pressure are affecting companies such as KLA-Tencor Corp. (KLAC) and Micron Technology Inc. (MU).These uncertainties have spread throughout the industry as analysts put special attention to the supply chain, a future indicator of a possible deceleration in demand. Although every deceleration in the semiconductor industry is different, Xilinx's position in the communications market will be a factor that softens the negative effects in the medium term. Communications market revenues are expected to increase in the coming quarters as a result of the lifting of the denial order on ZTE Corporation (OTCPK:ZTCOY), while an increase in early 5G deployment activity in Korea will boost growth during the first half of 2019.We believe that the most important catalyst in the medium term comes hand in hand with 5G wireless technology. Xilinx has already started to market its new product RFSoC (radio frequency system-on-a-chip) of 16nm this year, as its customers are beginning to formulate early 5G infrastructure strategies. These products offer a reduction in energy consumption between 50% and 70%, and a reduction in space for future deployments of 5G, cable, and wireless backhaul applications. Xilinx RFSoC is seen as essential components in the 5G architecture, both in the fronthaul and backhaul, offering end-to-end solutions.Source: Extracted from Xilinx's Analyst Day 2018.The company estimates that the communications serviceable-available market will grow at an annual rate of 9% over the next five years. We estimate that Xilinx will capture much of this growth as technologies such as MIMO (multiple-input and multiple-output) increase the IC radio content and demand more RFSoC. This medium-term trend will partially offset a possible deceleration in other markets, in case analyst fears materialize, considering that the company receives up to 30% of its revenues from the communications market.Source: Extracted from Xilinx's Analyst Day 2018.Additionally, the company has introduced a new category of products called ACAP (adaptive compute acceleration platform), highly integrated multi-core heterogeneous compute platform, which extends far beyond the capabilities of traditional FPGA (field-programmable gate array) of Xilinx. The company seeks to capture the recent trend of telemetry and monitoring networks with its FPGA and ACAP offerings, as networks become more and more intelligent.Looking toward the long term, management has recently adopted a strategy centered on three pillars. Its growth strategy is to displace ASICs (application-specific integrated circuit), ASSP (application-specific standard parts), and traditional FPGAs with next-generation electronic systems or ACAP. The idea of ​​executives is to focus on enabling ""the adaptive intelligent world"" with an emphasis on three main elements:Xilinx is stepping up its efforts with key customers in the data center market, transforming the company from an FPGA vendor to an FPGA-as-a-Service provider. This transformation began with the introduction of its 28nm products, recently extending them with 16nm products such as MPSoC and RFSoC.The data center strategy has made significant progress so far this year, and the FPGA-as-a-Service has been adding important key companies such as Alibaba (BABA), Amazon (AMZN), Baidu (BIDU), and Huawei. The new family of 16nm products has seen strong demand during the first quarter of 2019, growing by 76% compared to the same period last year.Although revenues from the data center market represent only 20%, the company expects the serviceable-available market to grow at a 67% CAGR in the next 5 years, driven by an exponential growth of big data analytics.Source: Extracted from Xilinx's Analyst Day 2018.On the other hand, we consider that the most disruptive pillar of this new strategy comes from its new category of adaptive computing (ACAP), which can adapt to the needs of a wide range of applications and workloads such as video transcoding, database, and data compression, while also offering artificial intelligence tools for search and inference, machine vision, genomics, storage, and compute and network acceleration.Although the benefits of Xilinx ACAP products will not be material until after 2020, we believe that the innovative power of the company has raised it as a leader in the space, in contrast to its most important competitor, Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) Altera.In general, we believe that Xilinx will witness a series of new trends that will boost the demand of its core markets during the coming years. We estimate that the demand for FPGA will increase in the long term, supported by its unique characteristics. The company is a market leader in the FPGA, with a 60% share, showing a technological advantage over its closest competitor Intel's Altera for some years.Trends coming from artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), 5G connectivity, autonomous vehicles, and Internet of Things (IoT) will create new opportunities for the programmable-logic devices of the company. We believe that Xilinx is well positioned to take advantage of the opportunity derived from these trends, easily generating a CAGR between 12-13% over the next 5 years.XLNX data by YChartsThe company has reviewed its expectations for the fiscal year 2019, and now executives expect revenues to be in the range of $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion, with 15% revenue growth at the midpoint. With this growth rate in mind, we see that the company seems attractive from an income-based ratios perspective. A quick analysis of the EV/revenue ratios shows that the price of shares does not yet reflect the expected growth of the company, both from the short and the long term.Although Xilinx cannot be considered as a company trading at a discount, we believe that the long-term trends explained above, along with the company's superior portfolio of products, should be sufficient reasons to give the company's shares higher multiples.The price of the shares seems to show the determination of investors for the company, especially during the increase in volatility in the overall market this past week, showing the momentum of its shares.XLNX EV to Revenues (TTM) data by YCharts"
4109059,76975,2017-09-24T21:06:09-04:00,"Xilinx has in the past been bogged down by a rather narrow FPGA market.That is, however, beginning to change with mega-cloud providers deploying FPGAs in their cloud to accelerate critical workloads.Meanwhile, the company has managed to score a breakthrough in wireless communication.","Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) has for long dominated the FPGA industry, with a market share of 53% vs. 36% for Intel (NASDAQ: INTC)-owned Altera (2016). The big problem for Xilinx has been that it has merely been a big fish swimming in a small pond, with FPGAs considered as a rather narrow and obscure market in parallel processing. Indeed, massive data centers by the likes of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have mainly been using GPUs from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) to accelerate and provide 10x or more the performance of a CPU for AI, deep neural networks, complex data analytics, advanced networking and 4K live streaming video workloads. That's the chief reason why Nvidia has been reporting triple-digit growth in its datacenter segment, now approaching a $1.7 billion run rate. Meanwhile, Xilinx has seen its top line crawl at an anemic 1% growth over the past five years.Source: EE TimesThat sluggish growth with no clear growth runways ahead has resulted in XLNX stock underperforming popular benchmarks such as SOXX by a considerable margin.Source: CNN MoneyBut that is now likely to change. After a superb 12.3% growth in 2017, the wider semiconductor industry is expected to slow down to 2.7% in 2018 and 0.2% in 2019. Meanwhile, the FPGA market is expected to maintain a steady 7.3% CAGR through 2024 to hit nearly $12.1 billion by 2024, with no down years in between.Source: Variant ResearchBut those estimates could prove to be conservative; at least in the case of Xilinx. After all, GPUs are no longer the only acceleration game in town. Microsoft was the first megacloud company to announce that it was using FPGAs in its data center. Microsoft showcased Project Brainwave, a real-time deep-learning platform that runs on Altera's FPGAs, in 2016. Microsoft has also been using FPGAs to accelerate Bing Search. Soon after, Xilinx announced that Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) was using its FPGAs for machine learning tasks, including speech processing and autonomous driving technology.The real breakthrough for Xilinx, however, did not arrive until it partnered with Amazon in late 2016. Unlike Microsoft which only uses FPGAs in its internal cloud operations, Amazon went a step further and has built custom servers that enable AWS customers to access new public F1 Elastic Cloud instances, with each instance supporting up to eight 16nm Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGAs.FPGAs have traditionally been used by hardware designers. An FPGA is capable of taking your software description of how your hardware should work and rewire itself accordingly to act as a real chip. The new AWS EC2 F1 now brings the power of FPGA to the mainstream, without having to buy the FPGA itself. Virtually anybody with highly structured and repetitive computing can now access the service. This includes hardware designers, who can use EC2 F1 to create a software description of a hypothetical chip and compile it into tiny gates that can compute the solution in the shortest amount of time. The only thing that's possibly faster is etching the transistors in real silicon.AWS EC2 F1 can find ready application by Bitcoin miners. These guys cryptographically secure hash functions gazillions of times a day. By employing the FPGA instance, miners can now speed up their search a good deal. Any user with a similar compact, repetitive algorithm or one that needs to run calculations that don't easily map into standard instruction sets can use the FPGA instance.Amazon's FPGA-as-a-Service is the first of its kind, and helps to reinforce AWS' reputation as the most feature-rich and multi-functional public cloud. Xilinx has a target of hitting $300 million in data center sales in three years, but there's good reason to believe that it could actually exceed that target. The traditional approach to FPGAs has been laborious since developers are required to program in low-level machine languages such as RTL and Verilog. You can bet there are not many experts in these low-level languages. AWS, on the other hand, plans to make FPGA programming much easier by abstracting out the I/O into an FPGA shell that will allow faster software development since developers can focus on their core functionalities instead of trying to program the FPGA I/O interfaces. Further, AWS has announced that OpenCL will come soon and indeed it's already in the beta stage.The dedication by AWS to bring FPGAs to the mainstream might be just what's required to open up this niche market.It's not hard to see other cloud providers, including Microsoft, borrowing a leaf from Amazon. Microsoft might decide to abstract its Azure cloud by providing FPGA-as-a-Service for customers. There's a good chance that the company will turn to Xilinx UltraScale+, especially since Altera's Arria 10 (20nm) has been disappointing while Stratix 10 (14nm) has been facing delays. Xilinx leads Altera in the advanced nodes (16nm and 20nm) by nearly a full year, while its 7nm tapeouts remain ahead of schedule. There's chance that Altera could challenge Xilinx in the 10nm node, though that does not look very likely at this point.Xilinx is a major provider of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) to the automotive industry, in the infotainment sector. With Level 5 autonomy (the highest level) expected to hit the self-driving industry as early as 2020, Xilinx's automotive revenue has been growing rapidly and currently sits at 8% of overall revenue. There are, however, concerns by investors that just like other car subsystems, ADAS will quickly become commoditized.This, however, does not seem very likely. Autonomous algorithms are highly dynamic and constantly evolving. FPGAs provide OEMs with the most flexible solution to constantly update their solutions and stay ahead of the chasing pack. Further, the flexibility of FPGAs provides OEMs with the ability to differentiate their solutions.Xilinx is also looking to expand its communications segment - the company has become the first in the industry to deliver all programmable RFSoCs, a disruptive integration and architectural breakthrough for 5G wireless systems. The new architecture infuses RF-class analog technology into 16nm all programmable MPSoCs, thus eliminating discrete data converters and providing up to 75% power and footprint reduction. Manufacturers are now required to meet stringent power and form factor requirements for deployment of 5G systems. The Xilinx RFSoC is a real game changer in the rapidly maturing massive MIMO active antenna array market.Massive MIMO (multiple-input, multiple-output) is currently the quickest and most efficient way that mobile operators can increase their network capacity without using additional antennas or base stations.Source: SamsungMassive MIMO supports aggregation of up to five LTE carriers, and can increase cell throughput by up to 6.4x with no need for additional infrastructure.Source: SamsungSprint Corp. (NYSE:S) plans to undertake the first massive MIMO deployment in the U.S. Xilinx RFSoC allows the company to become the first preferred digital solution for this market for next-generation 4G and 5G wireless networks.Xilinx has seen its top-line growth improve to high double-digits in the trailing 12-month period, and has forecast 5.8% growth for FY 2018 (which I believe is conservative). Meanwhile, the company has been able to maintain healthy operating margin of 30%+ and double-digit bottom-line growth, 2% dividend yield, a five-year dividend growth rate of 11.9% and a modest payout of 0.56. XLNX stock should have little trouble maintaining total shareholder returns of 15%+ over the next 2-3 years."
4015696,24757,2016-10-27T11:05:54-04:00,"Xilinx revenue was up 10% y/y.Intel Altera segment up 6% y/y.Intel 14 nm FPGA products are likely too little, too late.","Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), the maker of semiconductor accelerator chips, showed strong y/y growth when it reported on its third quarter on October 19. Most significantly, it beat Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in a manner that indicates Xilinx may continue to grow faster than Intel's rival ""Programmable Solutions Group"" over the next few years.Xilinx Q3 BasicsNote that I am calling Xilinx's recently reported quarter Q3, when technically it is Q2 of fiscal 2017.Revenue was $579 million, up 1% sequentially from $575.0 million and up 10% from $528 million in the year-earlier quarter.GAAP net income was $164 million, up 1% sequentially from $163.0 million, and up 29% from $127 million year-earlier. Diluted GAAP EPS (earnings per share) were $0.61, flat sequentially from $0.61, and up 27% from $0.48 year-earlier.Xilinx ended the quarter with $3.7 billion in cash and $1 billion in long-term debt. Operating cash flow was $184 million. $100 million was used to repurchase shares.$84 million was paid out in dividends in Q3. The next dividend payment of $0.33 will be due to shareholders of record on November 8 and paid on November 23, 2016. At the closing price on October 26 of $50.29, that is equivalent to an annual yield of 2.6%.Xilinx has been as low as $40.44 during the last 52 weeks and set a high of $55.48 on September 30, 2016.Zynq FPGA (Source: Xilinx)Intel LagsIntel also had a good Q3. Revenue was $15.8 billion, up 17% sequentially from $13.5 billion and up 9% from $14.5 billion year-earlier.GAAP net income was $3.4 billion, up 158% sequentially from $1.33 billion and up 9% from $3.1 billion year-earlier. GAAP EPS (diluted) was $0.69, up 155% sequentially from $0.27 and up 8% from $0.64 year-earlier.Intel's annual revenue growth was just slightly behind Xilinx, but earnings growth was quite a bit slower.If that indicated future trends, and if the markets were rational, Xilinx should have a higher P/E ratio than Intel. Xilinx's trailing 12 month P/E Ratio is 22.1, and Intel's is 16.5.While Intel and Xilinx are direct competitors, Xilinx is focused on FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays and related devices), while Intel is a much larger company that competes mainly in CPUs but with a variety of other specialties, including memory.Intel's good y/y results were led by its datacenter group, basically server chips, up 10% y/y, and its Internet of Things group, up 19% y/y.I would note that Intel's dividend works out to 2.95% (at the closing price of $34.92 on 10/26), a bit higher than Xilinx's.Xilinx v. Intel's ""Altera"" divisionIntel bought Xilinx's prime competitor, Altera, late December 2015. Altera is now Intel's ""Programmable Solutions Group."" In Q3 the group had revenue of $425 million, down 9% sequentially, but up 6% y/y.So in Q3, in direct competition over the type of programmable devices Xilinx and Altera specialize in, Xilinx grew revenue 10% while Intel's rival group grew at 6%. Since Xilinx was already the larger company (than Altera) before Intel took over, it would seem to be on the path to dominating this sector.There are some moving parts to look at that could explain why (at least for now) Xilinx is outpacing Intel's group. Intel bought Altera because of the increasing importance of non-CPU accelerators in datacenters, HPC (high-performance computing) and particularly cloud computing. As Intel's CEO Brian Krzanich explained in the Q3 conference call, FPGAs are just one type of accelerator. The two other common types are GPUs (graphics processing units), which are good at tasks like AI in addition to video rendering, and ASICs, which are pre-programmed for a specific task when they are designed. Intel is losing the GPU race to both AMD and Nvidia. By having its own FPGA division, it can capture some of the accelerator market. In the long run, it may be able to put FPGAs on the same chip as its CPUs, thus dominating the server accelerator market.In the meantime, however, most FPGAs are doing anything but accelerating server farms. They are used in myriad devices. Some of the most common applications are in communications, both wireless and wired, networking, industrial controls, and instrumentation. The U.S. military is a major buyer. Intel's group has to continue to supply the former Altera customers, and compete for all the new slots.I believe, based on Xilinx's extensive Q3 report and Intel's published numbers, that Xilinx is gaining traction because it did a better job executing against Altera and then Intel. While there are many aspects to this, to keep it short I will focus on the move to 14 nm and 16 nm.As with other types of semiconductors, over time manufacturers can put more transistors onto the same size chip, so the chips become more capable. Most of the advanced FPGAs being sold today are on the 20 nm process node. The most cutting edge generation, however, is Xilinx's 16 nm UltraScale+ family.In theory Intel's 14 nm family should be able to beat Xilinx's 16 nm family. A smaller process node allows more gates to be thrown at a problem, plus some power savings. The possible advantage of 14 over 16 is more apparent when you square them to get surface area: 14 squared is 196, but 16 squared is 256, so the Intel node should have a 24% advantage, which would be significant. But in this case, customers are going with the Xilinx solutions. Part of this is that complex circuitry has design issues other than just the number of gates that can be squeezed onto a chip in theory.The main factor is that Xilinx's 16 nm family got started over a year ago. Intel's 14 nm sample chips only became available earlier this month. Meanwhile Xilinx has over 200 customers for its 16 nm chips.In addition, there are at least some end customers who are worried that in the long run they will be too small for Intel to care about supporting. The worry is that Intel will focus on chips that go with its CPUs, and not try to keep up a lot of designs where the demand is small.Finally, Xilinx is also focused on beating Intel to 7 nm products. Given that Intel is a year or more behind Xilinx right now, it is reasonable to expect to see 7 nm FPGAs from Xilinx before Intel. However, that is also dependent on the progress foundries make towards the 7 nm node.Even in cloud computing Intel's FPGA group may not win the day. Xilinx is supplying FPGAs to Baidu for machine learning in datacenters. AMD, ARM, Huawei, IBM, Mellanox, Qualcomm, and Xilinx joined forces to bring a high-performance open acceleration framework to data centers. The companies are collaborating on the specification for the new Cache Coherent Interconnect for Accelerators (NASDAQ:CCIX). While Intel CPUs may dominate today's datacenters, if they can't catch up with Xilinx's lead in accelerators, the Altera acquisition might become a headwind in the datacenter market.Xilinx's own problemWhile Xilinx has been executing well, gradually building up a solid lead over Altera/Intel, it does have a problem investors should be aware of: fluctuating end demand.Here is a table of Xilinx's revenue by fiscal years (ending in April)As you can see from the table, there was a bit of a peak in 2014-2015. This was because deployments for 4G cellphones ramped in those years.Total fiscal 2017 revenue looks like it should get back up to about 2014-2015 levels, and that is without a major cellphone infrastructure ramp. So the non-cellphone market for Xilinx products is growing.In Q3 Xilinx had 5 of its 8 end markets grow. So 3 failed to grow. The march of technology can be slowed or reversed by the macroeconomic environment or industry-specific slumps. The U.S. defense budget can affect Xilinx, both the overall budget and the specific programs that get funded.However, there should be another spike when 5G cellphone system deployments begin. Cloud server farms tend to be sophisticated customers who would not feel compelled to put Intel FPGAs next to Intel servers, and accelerators for Cloud are a growing market. There is also likely to be demand for FPGAs from autonomous driving systems (Xilinx already sells FPGAs for automotive infotainment systems). As AI systems become more common for a wide variety of applications, FPGAs will as well.GuidanceXilinx December quarter (fiscal Q3) revenue is expected about flat sequentially. Expense is likely to be up as new 16 nm design tape outs accelerate.Intel is also guiding to essentially flat in Q4 revenue, though possibly down slightly. There is no guidance specific to the Altera/ Programmable Solutions Group.ConclusionI believe Intel remains a sound investment because people still need client devices. The growth area for Intel CPUs is for the Cloud that serve the clients. Intel's CPU domination for servers is not likely to end soon, though it is possible AMD could gain some market share back later in 2017. Intel's purchase of Altera shows the importance of the FPGA segment to the future of computing infrastructure, but Programmable Solutions Group revenue was only 2.7% of total revenue in Q3, so it should be kept in perspective.In the 2 to 3-year time frame I think it is probably Xilinx stock will appreciate more than Intel, more than enough to offset Intel's slightly higher current dividend yield. Xilinx dominates the 16 nm and 20 nm FPGA market, so it is likely to continue to gain market share. Because Xilinx has good cost controls in place, it is likely to continue to grow earnings faster than revenue, and faster than Intel will be able to do. For that reason it should also be able to maintain its higher P/E ratio."
4027083,76975,2016-11-29T15:28:59-05:00,"Lattice Semiconductor recently agreed to be acquired, leaving Xilinx as the only major FPGA manufacturer in the country.There's a good chance that Xilinx itself will be acquired by another semiconductor company.Growing use of FPGAs in the data center might however provide an even stronger investment case.","Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC), the third-largest FPGA, or Field-Programmable Gate Array, maker agreed to be acquired by Canyon Bridge Capital Partners in a $1.3B all-cash deal in early November. The deal represents $8.30/Lattice Semiconductor share, a good 30% premium for the shares. The deal is expected to be consummated in early 2017.Curiously though, the proposed merger is a purely financial play since Canyon Bridge is only a global private equity buyout fund. Canyon Bridge will let Lattice Semi operate autonomously so to give it a chance to further develop its promising niches including low-powered FPGAs that are a good fit for virtual/augmented reality applications. LSCC's shares are currently trading at just $7.09, or about 14.6% below the takeout price. The shares have been sliding after a report by Reuters that the Chinese government will be partly funding the acquisition. There are fears that this might draw extra regulatory scrutiny from U.S. authorities, and the deal might not pass muster.Assuming the deal eventually sees light of day, it will effectively leave Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) as the only major FPGA maker. Xilinx boasts ~50% market share after Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) acquired Altera in a huge $16.7B deal (11% premium) last year. Xilinx and Altera are the biggest and second-biggest FPGA manufacturers in the country with a combined 87% market share while Lattice Semiconductor owns a 10% slice of the market.Source: Market RealistXilinx and Altera have done a pretty good job defending the duopoly over the years, although smaller players such as Microsemi (NASDAQ:MSCC), QuickLogic (NASDAQ:QUIK), and Lattice Semi have been nipping at their heels and have managed to steal 2% share from the pair over the past five or so years.Xilinx's shares have climbed about 7% since reports of the merger hit news feeds. The company remains the only mid-cap semiconductor company that is yet to be acquired. XLNX has in the past been linked to potential mergers with suitors such as Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). But with Qualcomm's sight now set on NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI), Broadcom is now widely seen as the best candidate since the two companies serve similar markets including hyperscale, enterprise, and telecom. A merger between the two would provide clear cross-selling opportunities.XLNX's shares are now up 13.5% YTD.Xilinx YTD share returnsSource: CNN MoneyIronically, Xilinx's strong balance sheet and improving operational metrics might actually make the company less inclined to an acquisition. The company reported good Q3 earnings with revenue of $579 million, good for 10% Y/Y growth while GAAP net income of $163 million was up a healthy 29% Y/Y. Meanwhile, gross margin improved 15bps to 70.7% while operating margin improved to 32.4%. The company's other financial metrics look attractive too, including $3.7B in cash and $1B in long-term debt.With Qualcomm effectively out of the picture, Xilinx might not fetch an attractive premium comparable to what Lattice Semi received. That, coupled with the fact that the company's business case is gradually improving, might discourage its management from going for an acquisition at the moment.But XLNX investors will probably be fine either way.Pushing FPGAs into the data centerEvery new hardware that offers compelling benefits compared to legacy devices usually faces an uphill task trying to overcome the inertia from the mountains of software that run on older platforms. On the hardware side of things, FPGAs have been proven to offer compelling benefits compared to CPUs. An FPGA-accelerated platform offers similar performance to a generic Xeon cluster but with huge systems cost and power savings.Source: The Next PlatformBut the software side is something else. Programming FPGAs using hardware languages such as VHDL and Verilog might seem alien to Java and C programmers, not to mention that importing code from such high-level languages via an OpenCL framework is anything but straightforward.Xilinx is aware of these obstacles and has been working hard to make its FPGAs viable replacements for CPUs and GPUs in the data center. The company has now built a Reconfigurable Acceleration Stack, or RAS, for companies that want to get the task of using FPGAs to accelerate their workloads much easier. Xilinx's new stack is aimed at hyperscalers, as well as High-Performance Computing and large enterprise players.Source: The Next PlatformThe stack's base platform allows framework integration for five key workloads namely machine learning inference, video transcoding, storage compression, network acceleration, and SQL query/data analytics. Xilinx is not so much focused on the revenue potential of its new acceleration stack as much as it needs to get hyperscale and enterprises to start viewing FPGA acceleration differently.For companies that do not have the know-how or resources to learn how to run FPGAs, Xilinx has partnered with Nimbix, a top HPC provider, to provide a cloud-based environment to replicate the functions of its RAS.RAS is not a turnkey solution for hyperscale players, but Xilinx says that it will get them 80% there. The company hopes that RAS will help FPGAs gain popularity in the data center the way GPUs have done. And who is to say that it cannot happen? The HPC community was responsible for popularizing the use of GPUs in tasks such as machine learning before hyperscale companies took the idea and ran away with it. And of course, GPU leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is now enjoying the rich pickings.The same could start happen with FPGAs on a large scale. For instance, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), the second largest hyperscale cloud company, has designed its Project Olympus with room for both GPUs and FPGAs to be used as accelerators on a single node in the application stack. The HPC community has already demonstrated the usefulness of FPGAs in industries such as financial services, oil, and gas. But it's hyperscale companies such as Microsoft that will take FPGAs to the next level.Xilinx is cagey about FPGA prices much the same way Nvidia prices or its Tesla GPU accelerators. The company though estimates that at hyperscale volumes, its high-end Virtex UltraScale FPGAs will be comparable in price to mid-to-high-end Xeon server chips.That's half the battle won.Good long-term outlookXilinx has started showing growing revenue momentum, and FPGAs in the data center might do for the company what high-end GPUs are doing for Nvidia. Currently, a large chunk of the company's revenue is coming from 4G LTE deployments. Further, the company is touting its leadership in 5G telecommunications, where it hopes to leverage 16nm and 7nm nodes to gain a one-year lead over Altera. The company has projected mid-single-digit growth over the next 12 months while analysts see earnings growth clocking in at around 9% CAGR over the next five years.Give that XLNX's stock already trades at a premium to its peers thanks to its superior margin structure, that kind of modest top/bottom-line growth might not be enough to drive the 20%-plus annualized gains that investors crave over the next three of four years. XLNX's stock has a dividend yield of 2.48% and has compounded dividend at more than 12% over the past five years and more than 14% over the past decade. Assuming 8% dividend growth over the next five years, 10% annualized return should be in the cards at the very minimum (Total Return for Growing Perpetuity = Yield + Growth).I, however, expect XLNX's stock to perform substantially better than that. We have all witnessed the kind of buzz that AI has created and the way NVDA stock has benefited (up 203% over the past 12 months). While I don't expect FPGAs to suddenly become darlings in the data center, the buzz created by hyperscale adoption would probably be enough to drive XLNX to 20%-plus annualized gains over the forecast period. After all, only around 0.1% of data center servers have deployed GPUs while only 10% of Nvidia's revenue is AI-related. If Xilinx is able to nab two or three major cloud customers, investors will be talking about a whole different ballgame.Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4068017,24757,2017-05-02T16:13:13-04:00,"March quarter results were in midrange of guidance, with revenue up 7% y/y.Now going head-to-head against Intel’s FPGA division.Long-term investors can look ahead to 5G rollout by 2020.Amazon cloud could help grow revenue meanwhile.","Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX), the leading semiconductor company specializing in FPGAs (field programmable gate arrays), had a solid calendar Q1 2017. Hidden within that performance are the seeds of potentially much faster growth in the next decade. The stock price remains reasonable, but appears to be based only on past performance. In other words, it could go up significantly if this relatively overlooked company's profits do start to accelerate.I'll provide a brief summary of calendar Q1 (fiscal Q4 2017) results below. But since that information is readily available, first I will cover the chief future upward inflection points.Xilinx Zynq processor board. Source: XilinxMid future: 5G telecommunications rolloutThe current high-end cellphone communication standard is often referred to as 4G. The next standard will be 5G (fifth generation). Within the standard are a host of protocols that need to work. FPGAs are typically used to enable high-end devices, and that is what will happen with 5G.4G is still being rolled out (in Pakistan, for instance), and that provides a substantial amount of revenue for Xilinx. For that matter, in some countries most 4G is still in the future, despite its first commercial deployment having been in December 2009. Rollouts can take years, from the first test station deployments, on through the peak rollout (usually set by China), and then on to the tail.5G rollout is likely to start in earnest in 2020, if there are no technical delays. Peak deployment revenue might be reached a year to three later. But companies will be making equipment for 5G before then. Aside from the astonishing speed at which FPGAs can process communications data in devices like cellular base stations (cell towers), they can be reprogrammed as necessary. So the same device can be used early in development, then in actual deployment, and then upgraded in the field.It is not possible to predict the exact timing of revenue from the 5G rollout.Xilinx announced it already has a new product for the 5G rollout: the All Programmable RF SoC product family, ""a disruptive integration and architectural breakthrough for 5G wireless with RF class analog technology. This family provides a 50-75% power and footprint reduction for 5G, cable and wireless backhaul applications."" It is being produced on the 16 nm process, which is currently the cutting-edge.At the Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) conference on May 27 a statement was also made about 5G technology, in an answer to a question from an analyst. Intel said its modem continues to gain momentum with one large customer, plus others showing interest. ""We are optimistic about competing in 5G where the modem, base station and backhaul are so important.""Intel bought Xilinx's traditional rival Altera in 2016. While both would benefit from the 5G rollout, as both benefited from the 4G rollout, there is always the question of how much market share each will win.Mid future: cloud accelerationUsing semiconductor chips other than Intel's CPUs to accelerate cloud computing workflow has become a big issue in the last two years, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) showing particularly impressive revenue results from this trend. Probably the main reason Intel bought Altera was to better compete in this space, though in Intel's case it is more about not losing server market share to Nvidia and others.Xilinx does not break out how much of its revenue comes from chips used for server acceleration, but it would be included in the Communications and Data Center segment, with was 41% of total revenue, or about $250 million, in Q1. It is likely a small component of the segment at this point. However, the company has been hard at work overcoming a traditional problem: relatively few people know how to program an FPGA, compared to those who can program a CPU or GPU.The results of this effort were seen in the announcement that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS) cloud now has Xilinx chips (Virtex UltraScale+) available for acceleration. This corresponds with the introduction of software allowing for relatively easy programming. While this does not mean a large sales volume in the next few quarters, it does create a lot of potential. As more programmers learn to use these FPGAs in the cloud, Amazon will deploy more to meet the demand.There is no automatic or easy win here. There is competition from GPUs by Nvidia and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). For the solutions best provided by FPGAs, there is still competition from Intel and smaller makers. In the Q1 conference call Xilinx indicated that the Microsoft Cloud solution is currently using Intel/Altera FPGAs, for instance.Far future: autonomous vehiclesJust about every semiconductor company I follow believes it can be a leader in providing the silicon intelligence necessary for autonomous vehicles. The prelude is driver assistance with breaking, parking, and staying in a lane. I believe that given the diversity of software and sensors needed to achieve mass-market autonomous driving, CPUs, FPGAs, and GPUs will all be incorporated into the final solution systems.Currently Xilinx does sell into the automobile market, but the products are for infotainment systems. Sales are lumped into its broadcast, consumer, and automotive segment, which generated 16% of total Q1 revenue or $97 million. Most projects for autonomous driving are in the prototyping stage, so the matter will be in flux for a few years. I would not be surprised to see Xilinx gain some share of this market, but I would think the main data crunching will be done by CPUs and GPUs. Again, for FPGAs, the rival in Intel.Intel RivalryI have mentioned above that in each of three major growth areas Intel, having bought Altera, is now the main rival of Xilinx. The two companies, Xilinx and Altera, had competed in the field for decades, with varying success. Xilinx had gained a clear lead by the time Intel acquired Altera.I would not jump to the conclusion that Altera plus Intel is set to outcompete Xilinx. It might be easy to jump to the opposing conclusion. Intel has tried to branch out from its dominance of the CPU universe to other semiconductor types many times, and so far has always failed, with the possible exception of memory chips. Intel was most recently unable to compete with CPUs for cell phones and tablets, despite an enormous capital investment. It also failed in its plans to develop discrete GPUs that could compete with AMD and Nvidia.In theory Intel should have several advantages over Xilinx. It dominates the server chip market, so it could pair accelerator FPGAs with its CPUs and offer customers a nice package. The counter to that is that Xilinx Is arguably ahead in the technology curve for FPGAs and has just proven its abilities with its Amazon win. It looks like the main battle will be between Intel's marketing muscle and Xilinx's brains. Since the field is in its infancy, it is too early to predict a winner.Intel can take its profits from high-margin server CPUs and plow them into FPGAs just like it tried with smartphone CPUs and GPUs. But the old Altera was profitable, with a high R&D budget, and was not quite able to keep up with Xilinx. Aside from undercutting Xilinx on pricing, it is not clear what a winning strategy for Intel could be.That said, at least for the next couple of years, each company is likely to maintain most of its market share. That is because most FPGA applications have long development cycles. In many segments once a device is chosen it may hold that socket for years. That is why a slight majority of Xilinx's Q1 revenue was for pre-28 nm products. 49% was from products at the newer 28 nm, 20 nm, and 16 nm processes.Q1 resultsThe March quarter, calendar Q1, was Xilinx's fiscal Q4 2017.Q1 2017 revenue was $609 million, up 4% sequentially from $586 million and up 7% from $571 million in the year-earlier quarter. That was within the midrange of prior guidance, which was for revenue between $590 and $620 millionGAAP net income was $153 million, up 8% sequentially from $142 million, but up 6% from $145 million year-earlier.GAAP diluted EPS (earnings per share) were $0.57, up 10% sequentially from $0.52, and up 6% from $0.54 year-earlier.Operating cash flow was $306 million. Cash and equivalents balance ended at $3.4 billion, up sequentially from $3.25 billion. There was $1.0 billion in long term debt.The dividend was increased $0.02 per share to $0.35, for shareholders of record on May 16, 2017, and payable on June 1, 2017.Q2 guidanceJune quarter, Q1 fiscal 2018, revenue is expected between $600 and $630 million. Gross margin 68% to 70%. Operating expense $242 million. Other income $1 million. Tax rate 12% to 15%.In other words, short-term guidance is not exciting, though I would be impressed if it came in at the high end of its range.Stock price and conclusionAs you can see from this five-day price chart, Xilinx's price spiked nicely after its results were released on April 26.That spike is against a background of a 52-week low of $42.37 back in May of 2016 and resulted in a 52-week high of $64.90 on April 27, 2017.Short run, I consider Xilinx to be in a fair price range. That means it is good for accumulation by long-term investors, but I don't see anything coming up before Q2 results that would significantly boost its stock price.Long term I see tremendous potential that is hard to put a number on. The main growth drivers are likely to be 5G, automotive, and cloud acceleration. I could only guess at how big those numbers could get by 2022. I see Xilinx out-competing Intel, but nothing is assured. Even if Intel gets the edge in one or more of these fields, I expect Xilinx to pick up significant market share."

As of this writing, only a few companies have released Q3 CY2016 earnings, but I forecast that revenue growth will be muted for the quarter compared to Q2. And Q4 may be worse!Already, Q3/Q2 revenues for LRCX were up 5.6% compared to 18.0% for Q2/Q1. For KLAC, results were worse: -18.3% for Q3/Q2 compared to +28.9% for Q2/Q1.One key is booking and billing data from SEMI, the global industry association. For September, bookings were down 6.1% over August 2016 and billings down a whopping 12.4%. Based on these statistics, equipment revenues should be muffled for Q3 revenues and stymied for Q4 2016.Semiconductor equipment as an investor's choice is riddled with caveatsWhile a stock will rise or fall based on consensus estimates, the long-term investor needs to understand the intricacies of the industry to make knowledgeable decisions. This writing this based on my 31 years of analyzing the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment space since I started The Information Network in 1985. I have no stock in any companies, which could influence my advice. I urge readers to click on the links to other articles I have written for more in-depth analysis of a given topic.Key technology moves for the investor to consider are:A key takeaway in the move to smaller dimensions is who is selling chips to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and which companies make equipment to sell to these semiconductor manufacturers. One way is to explore Apple teardowns. For example, we can read historical facts about the iPhone 7 teardown, but really need to look forward to the iPhone 8. For example, TSMC (NYSE:TSM) should remain the sole provider of A11 chips for Apple, and in fact, there are other TSMC 10nm customers, which include HiSilicon, Media Tek (OTCPK:MDTKF), and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX).In the 3D space, I previously wrote about it in an article entitled ""Applied Materials' Q3 Earnings Call - Separating The Hype From Reality,"" in which I discussed how Lam Research was gaining market share from Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT).Honing in on ChinaThere has been a great deal of press about the strong growth in fab construction in China lately, and I discussed this in an August 28, 2016, article in Seeking Alpha entitled ""Bain Is Right About China's Semiconductor Market And Applied Materials' Outlook Is Flawed.""SEMI published the table below, which is a listing of 19 new fabs and lines that will begin construction in 2016 and 2017. These are projects with a probability of 60 percent or higher (in other words push outs), according to SEMI.By product segment in China.Further, on September 6, 2016, SEMI published its August update of the World Fab Forecast report, as shown in the table below.There are two important takeaways from the table, which shows (1) increased equipment spending, reaching 4.1% year over year in 2016 and 10.6 percent in 2017, and (2) China in second place for overall equipment spending with 64% growth 2016.Before you start buying stock in companies selling equipment into China, keep in mind one important thing - not all equipment is new. Many semiconductor companies building or expanding into the country over the past decade have moved old 200mm equipment from, say a fab in Japan, into the China fab, then purchased new equipment for the Japan fab.Globalfoundries, for example, has been planning a 300mm fab in China as part of a joint venture with the government of Chongqing. Globalfoundries had expected to start producing 300mm wafers at the facility in 2017, using technology from its production line in Singapore. Globalfoundries intended to install used equipment from its Singapore fab. Unfortunately, the Chongqing government has balked and the project may not move forward.Nevertheless, new 300mm equipment is expected to be purchased and installed in China's 300mm foundries. In an attempt to capitalize on the success of TSMC as the world's largest foundry, China-based foundries have been promoting themselves by marketing ""TSMC-like"" services, mimicking the company's purchases for advanced-node equipment. This is a positive sign for the equipment market.Another important fact to remember is that for every fab build in China, that fab will not be built elsewhere.This past week, LRCX reported Q1 2017 financials and saw continued spend predominantly in the China region at the 28 nanometer and above nodes.KLAC also reported that 30-35% of its foundry business was with China.Key metrics of the semiconductor equipment marketThere are several important realities that investors in semiconductor equipment manufacturers need to know:Semiconductor manufacturers make purchases each year to the tune of $30 billion for either (1) technology buys when a company is moving to smaller dimensions, or (2) capacity buys when they need more equipment to make the same deviceEquipment purchases are strongly influenced by macroeconomic factors - if the economy is down, consumers will reconsider buying discretionary stuff that has chips.Semiconductor manufacturers are now closely monitoring demand and employing just-in-time principles to buy equipment (as well as other supply chain products) only when needed. In 2000, erroneous forecasts for DRAM growth by Gartner resulted in end users buying twice the number of DRAMs they needed to secure allocation, and DRAM manufacturers thought it was the real thing, making huge capacity purchases to make more DRAMs. The result was a collapse in the market and an oversupply of $10 billion DRAMs and ancillary chipsets in 2001.There is no real correlation between semiconductor revenue growth and equipment revenue. Yes, there are big inflections, such as the one I noted above for 2000/2001 and for the Great Recession in 2009, and there is a correlation between minor bumps in semiconductor revenues and followed a short time later by a minor bump in equipment bookings. However, the trendline for equipment bookings is flat, while the trendline for semiconductors is up. I discussed this way back in an April 17, 2009, article in Seeking Alpha.Investor takeawayAs I pointed out above, I own no stock in any of these companies, and none are clients of The Information Network. I write these articles in Seeking Alpha as a sanity check against the hype provided by company management.Revenues for Q3 CY2016 will be down compared to Q2, and I anticipate that Q4 growth will be lower than Q3 growth. These are revenues, and not earnings, which drive the volatility in stock prices. But I feel that the service I provide is of value for the long-term investor."

These dynamics add to the dividend growth potential embedded in the firm's capital-light business model, which drives solid free cash flow and helps maintain a healthy balance sheet. As of the end of fiscal 2016, the company had a net cash position of nearly $1.8 billion, inclusive of current debt. Free cash flow generation has averaged nearly $740 million over the past three fiscal years (2014-2016) and has been more than enough in covering annual cash dividend obligations of just under $300 million over the same time period.Thanks to such strong free cash flow generation, Xilinx appears to have very little dragging on its dividend growth potential. Management has been very shareholder friendly as of late, having returned more than 100% of operating cash flow to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases over the past ten years. Competing capital allocation options in the form of share repurchases (averaged more than $445 million from fiscal 2014-2016) have the potential to impact the pace of dividend expansion moving forward, and the board recently authorized an additional $1 billion in buybacks. Nevertheless, we expect the supporting macro trends to continue to fuel demand for Xilinx, and its solid free cash flow generation and impressive financial health should drive ongoing dividend increases. Based on its Dividend Cushion ratio of 2.9, we think the firm has significant room for healthy growth in the quarterly payout.Xilinx's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Xilinx makes FPGAs, SoCs and 3D ICs. These devices are coupled with a next-generation design environment and IP to serve a broad range of customer needs, from programmable logic to programmable systems integration. The company was founded in 1984 and is headquartered in California.• As with rival Altera, which was recently acquired by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Xilinx's strategy centers on the displacement of ASICs and ASSPs in the development of next-generation electronic systems. The company strives to drive down cost and power consumption at each manufacturing process node.• Investors in technology pay close attention to a firm's gross margin to get a read for product pricing pressures. We like the company's focus on growing earnings and its extremely cash-rich balance sheet. The firm's shares have benefited from recent reports that it could be acquired for $15 billion. Potential suitors include Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO).• The company is experiencing solid momentum in the 28nm market. Xilinx's quarterly revenue run-rate is expanding, and the firm ended fiscal 2016 with record levels of 28nm revenue. Difficult broadcasting and communications end markets may cap firm-wide sales growth, however.• The company is heavily dependent on distributor Avnet (NASDAQ:AVT) for the majority of sales revenue and order fulfillment. Resale of product through Avnet accounts for 40%+ of worldwide revenue and for two thirds of total net accounts receivable.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital.The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Xilinx's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 135.2%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.2%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Xilinx's free cash flow margin has averaged about 31.8% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Xilinx, cash flow from operations decreased about 9% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 24% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisWe think Xilinx is worth $44 per share with a fair value range of $35-$53.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from an evaluation of the historical volatility of key valuation drivers and a future assessment of them. Our near-term operating forecasts, including revenue and earnings, do not differ much from consensus estimates or management guidance. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 5.1% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 0.7%.Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 29.5%, which is below Xilinx's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Xilinx, we use a 10.2% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $44 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future were known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Xilinx. We think the firm is attractive below $35 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $53 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Xilinx's fair value at this point in time to be about $44 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Xilinx's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $55 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $44 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.This article or report and any links within are for information purposes only and should not be considered a solicitation to buy or sell any security.

After many trials, I have found out that a portfolio of 20 S&P 500 companies yielding more than 2% a year and having the highest Research & Development Expense to Revenue ratio is giving excellent results.I used the Portfolio123's screener to perform the search and to run back-tests according to these conditions. After running this screen on June 11, 2016, I discovered the following twenty stocks, which are shown in tables below. In this article, I will focus on the third ranked company, Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX).The table below presents the Research & Development Expense TTM, the Revenue TTM and the R&D to Revenue ratio, for the twenty companies.XilinxIn my view, at the current price XLNX is an excellent investment opportunity for the long term. According to the company, it is the world's leading provider of All Programmable FPGAs, SoCs, MPSoCs and 3D ICs, enabling the next generation of smarter, connected, and differentiated systems and networks. Driven by the industry-wide shifts towards Cloud Computing, SDN/NFV, Video Everywhere, Embedded Vision, Industrial IoT, and 5G Wireless, Xilinx's innovations enable these applications that are both software defined yet hardware optimized. As I see it, those areas are poised to show substantial growth which will continue to benefit the company.Source: Company's websiteOn April 27, Xilinx reported its fourth quarter fiscal 2016 financial results, which beat earnings-per-share expectations by $0.02 (3.85%). The company posted revenue of $571.1 million for the period, also surpassing the consensus estimate of $566.4 million. Xilinx has shown earnings-per-share surprise in three of its last four quarters, as shown in the table below.Data: Yahoo FinanceIn the report, Moshe Gavrielov, Xilinx's President and Chief Executive Officer, said:In my view, the fact that Xilinx continued to show strong momentum in new product sales, which constituted almost half of total revenue in the recent quarter and increased 20% year-over-year is very encouraging. The company is well positioned to benefit from a secular technology replacement cycle from ASICs (application specific integrated circuits) to the programmable logic device [PLD] chips that it produces. As chips get smaller, they become more expensive to produce and uneconomical for limited applications. Thus, the long-term trend is for the programmable logic device.Xilinx utilizes manufacturing process technologies that enable the PLD to increase functionality. Generally, the smaller the process technology, the higher the chip's performance and density and the lower the power consumption. According to the company, its highly successful 20nm Ultrascale family approached $100 million in sales in fiscal 2016, surpassing the company's forecasts in every quarter of the fiscal year. This family, which includes the PLD industry's only high-end family, is receiving adoption in a broad base of applications including wired and wireless communications, test & measurement, industrial and defense applications.Balance Sheet, Dividend and Share RepurchaseXilinx has a strong balance sheet. At the end of the fiscal year 2016, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $3.34 billion and total debt of $1.58 billion. The total debt to equity ratio was at 0.61.Along with its fourth-quarter earnings release, Xilinx declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.33 per outstanding share of common stock, an increase of 6.1% from the previous dividend of $0.31 per share. Xilinx increased its dividend for the eleventh time since initiating the program in 2004. The annual dividend yield is pretty high at 2.82%, and the payout ratio is at 57.9%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was high at 12.1%, over the past five years was also high at 14.1%, and over the last ten years was very high at 16%.During fiscal 2016, Xilinx paid its shareholders a record $319 million in dividends and repurchased 9.7 million shares for $443 million. Xilinx has returned 100% of operating cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividend and share repurchase over the past ten years.On May 16, Xilinx announced that its Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of up to an aggregate $1 billion of the company's debt and equity securities. In the past five years, the company has repurchased approximately 43 million shares of common stock for approximately $1.8 billion. Timing of repurchases and exact number of shares of common stock to be purchased will depend upon prevailing market conditions and other factors.XLNX Dividend data by YChartsValuationSince the beginning of the year, XLNX is down 0.5% while the S&P 500 Index has increased 2.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has lost 2.3%. Moreover, since the beginning of 2012, XLNX has gained only 45.8%.

In my opinion, the fact that Xilinx continued to show strong momentum in new product sales, which constituted almost half of total revenue in the recent quarter and increased 20% year-over-year, is very encouraging. XLNX's valuation is pretty good, the quick ratio is very high at 4.0, and the EV/EBITDA ratio is low at 13.68. Moreover, the company is generating high cash flow and returns substantial capital to its shareholders by stock buyback and increasing dividend payments, currently yielding 2.82%. As I see it, at the current price Xilinx stock is an excellent investment opportunity for the long-term.Back-testingIn order to find out how such a screening formula would have performed during the last two years, last ten years and last seventeen years, I ran the back-tests, which are available by the Portfolio123's screener.The back-test takes into account running the screen once a year and replacing the stocks that no longer comply with the screening requirement with other stocks that comply with the requirement. The theoretical return is calculated in comparison to the benchmark (S&P 500), considering 0.25% slippage for each trade and 1.5% annual carry cost (broker cost). The back-tests results are shown in the charts and the tables below.Two years back-testTen years back-testSeventeen years back-testSummaryThe dividend stocks screen has given much better returns during the last two years, the last ten years and the last seventeen years than the S&P 500 benchmark. The Sharpe ratio, which measures the ratio of reward to risk, was also much better in all the three tests.The two years return of the screen was at 15.89%, while the return of the S&P 500 index during the same period was at 7.53%. The difference between the dividend screen to the benchmark was even more noticeable in the 17 years back-test. The 17-year average annual return of the screen was at 11.68%, while the average annual return of the S&P 500 index during the same period was only 3.11%. The maximum drawdown of the screen was only 38.17%, while that of the S&P 500 was at 57%.Although this screening system has given superior results, I recommend readers use this list of stocks as a basis for further research."
3151086,23471,2015-05-07T01:12:40-04:00,"XLNX is suitable for the Enterprising Investor following the ModernGraham approach.According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is overvalued at the present time.The market is implying a 5.81% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, but in recent years, the company's earnings growth has not been that strong.","Xilinx Inc. (NASDAQ:XLNX) may attract some potential investors, as the company has trailed the market in the last year. Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether a company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how the company fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation, in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.XLNX data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 5/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a Defensive Investor: Score = 5/5Valuation SummaryKey DataBalance Sheet - March 2015Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryXLNX Dividend data by YChartsConclusionXilinx Inc. passes the initial requirements of the Enterprising Investor but not the more conservative Defensive Investor. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the high PEmg and PB ratios, and the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns. As a result, all value investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When it comes to valuation, it is critical to consider the company's earnings history. In this case, the company has seen its EPSmg (normalized earnings) rise from $1.64 in 2011 to only an estimated $2.14 for 2015. This is not a very high level of earnings growth, and does not support the market's implied estimate for 5.81% annual growth over the next 7-10 years. The ModernGraham valuation model returns an estimate of intrinsic value falling below the current price, indicating that the company is overvalued at the present time."
3036236,50792,2015-03-29T07:27:37-04:00,"Xilinx’s stock price has fallen over the last year because of stagnant revenue growth, largely due to unforeseen headwinds.The company’s product offerings and financial health are incredibly strong, however, and revenue growth should begin by 2017 at the latest.Management has emphasized the company’s priority of returning value to shareholders, and recently increased the dividend for the 10th straight year.We believe that now is a perfect time to buy shares in the semiconductor company.","Xilinx Inc. (Nasdaq: XLNX) is the world's largest fabless semiconductor company founded in Silicon Valley in 1984., and is subject to the same industry cycles as its rivals. After experiencing massive growth throughout the last decade in revenues, it has now tapered off over the last few years. This happens constantly in the semiconductor market, as companies overinvest when prices are good, causing an oversupply and prices fall. While market factors are harming the company's short-term performance and outlook, the company is still financially healthy.While Xilinx had experienced massive revenue growth, it has now tapered off, and the stock price has suffered because of it. Over the last year, the stock price has fallen over 20%, as projected revenue increases have not come to fruition. Some headwinds have played a part in stagnant revenue growth, but Xilinx is still an extremely strong company that is very attractive for investors seeking a reliable dividend stock. The semiconductor company is a technological leader in its field, has maintained robust gross margins over the last few years, and does an outstanding job of returning value to its shareholders.Disappointing Top Line ReturnsXilinx reported its most recent earnings information on January 21st, and revenue figures were disappointing for investors. Sales of $593.5 million were actually up 1% from the same quarter the previous year, but they fell 2% sequentially and missed analysts' estimates of $617 million. CFO Jon Olson explained that the revenue figures were harmed by a decline in wireless sales, which were impacted by weaker sales from non-China regions. Broadcast sales also declined because of weak purchasing activity from a couple of large customers.The semiconductor company has not projected a turnaround in revenue for the current quarter, either. CEO Moshe Gavrielov summed up the company's expectations for 2016 as planning for a flat to low rate growth environment. Xilinx is facing headwinds from aerospace and defense due to normal seasonality and program-related timing. Besides the expected declines in aerospace and defense, the company is facing uncertainty in global communication spending. The stock price fell 6% after the announcement, and concerns over the top line have held the stock price back.Why Long Term Investors Should Buy This StockOne of the main bright spots for Xilinx last quarter was the performance of its 28-nanometer products. This product, along with Xilinx's early lead in technology for its 20nm and 16nm products, makes the company arguably the current technological leader in the semiconductor market. Its standing as a market leader in technology puts the company in good position to start growing revenue in the future, especially once the headwinds the company is currently facing subside.During the December quarter, 28nm sales increased nearly 20% sequentially. This growth is extremely promising because this node is very early in its lifecycle, which is expected to be longer and have a higher peak than any of the company's previous product nodes. Xilinx expects that this node will grow more than 30% in fiscal year 2016, which will already be a record for revenue of any of its previous products.This is especially exciting considering how the majority of the revenue from this product is still to come in the future. So far, the 28nm node earns its revenues through the Wireless, as well as Test & Measurements and Consumer, markets. The node is now starting to be used for other markets, such as Automotive and Wired, which will increase revenues, and it will additionally be used for other fields like Broadcast further down the road.Starting in 2017, if not earlier, the success of the 28nm will cause revenues for the company to grow from its current levels of roughly $2.4 billion, where it has been for the past few years. The company is also about a year ahead of its competitors in the 20nm node. Xilinx is the first semiconductor company to reach quality production for this node, which will complement the 28nm node well. When these products cause revenue to grow, the stock price will surely increase, as the company's health is outstanding. Figure 1. 5 Year Graph Of XLNX Gross Margins Compared To Main Rivals.Xilinx's gross margins have continued to be extremely strong even as its top line has been sluggish. Xilinx has had market leading gross margins of 68 to 70% over the last few years, and that continued during the last quarter. Its gross margin of 69.7% was at the high end of this range. Operating income of 32% was also better than expected, as the company's operating expenses were only $224 million, $6 million less than expected. These income figures contributed to rather strong earnings per share of $0.62.Looking ahead to 2016, headwinds will likely keep revenue flat, but the gross margins will continue to lead the industry. Along with the eventual revenue growth as a result of Xilinx's products and the lower stock price caused by headwinds the company is currently facing, now would be a good time to buy the stock. What puts it over the top and should cause every investor to add it to their portfolio is the company's commitment to return value to its shareholders.The company's strong profit margins help it have a strong balance sheet and cash flow, giving the company the financial flexibility to undertake shareholder-friendly initiatives. Xilinx recently announced a hike to its quarterly cash dividend, increasing it 2 cents to 31 cents per share. The yearly dividend payout of $1.24 per share reflects a dividend yield of roughly 3%. And this dividend yield will grow further in the future, as the company has increased its dividend every year since the company started paying a dividend of 5 cents per share in fiscal 2004. This represents a compounded annual growth of 18%.Figure 2. 10-Year Graph Of XLNX Dividend Growth.The dividend is the first part of the company's strategy to return value to shareholder, and share buybacks are the second. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2015, Xilinx returned approximately $476 million to investors in share buybacks, along with the $230.6 million it paid out in dividends. Moreover, Xilinx has repurchased approximately $1.8 billion in common stock since 2010. Amazingly, the company has returned roughly 100% of its operating cash flow over the last 10 years to investors, including about 120% of the operating cash flow from the first three quarters of fiscal year 2015.Algorithmic AnalysisI Know First is a financial services firm that utilizes an advanced self-learning algorithm to analyze, model and predict the stock market. The algorithm produces a forecast with a signal and a predictability indicator. The signal is the number in the middle of the box. The predictability is the number at the bottom of the box. At the top, a specific asset is identified. This format is consistent across all predictions.The signal represents the predicted movement direction or trend, and is not a percentage or specific target price. The signal strength indicates how much the current price deviates from what the system considers an equilibrium or ""fair"" price. The signal can have a positive (predicted increase) or negative (predicted decline) sign. The heat map is arranged according to the signal strength with strongest up signals at the top, while down signals are at the bottom. The table colors are indicative of the signal. Green corresponds to the positive signal and red indicates a negative signal. A deeper color means a stronger signal and a lighter color equals a weaker signal.The predictability indicator measures the importance of the signal. The predictability is the historical correlation between the prediction and the actual market movement for that particular asset, which is recalculated daily. Theoretically the predictability ranges from minus one to plus one. The higher this number is the more predictable the particular asset is. If you compare predictability for different time ranges, you'll find that the longer time ranges have higher predictability. This means that longer-range signals are more important and tend to be more accurate.Figure 3. Algorithmic Analysis of XLNX For 3-Month And 1-Year Time Horizons.The algorithmic forecast for Xilinx is very bullish, with strong signal strengths of 59.20 and 142.69 in the 3-month and 1-year time horizons, respectively. The rather bullish outlook from the algorithm makes sense considering how the stock price has fallen drastically over the last year. The price decrease is only because of current market headwinds, and the company's financial health and business plan are both exceedingly strong. What makes the company truly attractive to investors, though, is its solid commitment to returning value to its shareholders. The company's executive team continues to stress this importance whenever given the chance, and its confidence in its future means the company is sure to continue to increase its dividend and a further increase in shareholder value.I Know First Research is the analytic branch of I Know First, a financial startup company that specializes in quantitatively predicting the stock market.

3243356,89106,2015-06-08T12:29:34-04:00,Xilinx has a strong business model and a good competitive position.Xilinx’s commitment to generate shareholder value is huge.We believe Xilinx to be (widely) undervalued.A M&A deal could make a long investment in XLNX even more lucrative.,"By Hector Mercadier and Thomas LesacheyXilinx's BusinessXilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) is a US fabless semiconductor company. Its main focus is on FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays), integrated circuits which have many applications in aerospace, defense, automotive, factories, data centers and more.Xilinx is the inventor of the FPGA technology, and managed to capture a large part of the market: it has more than 80% market share together with its main rival Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR), over which Xilinx has an edge.Being a fabless company, meaning that it doesn't have any actual plants manufacturing the parts and semiconductors needed to assemble the FPGA boards, Xilinx has a particular relationship with semiconductor suppliers. It gets wafers from three main sources: UMC, Samsung (OTC:SSNLF) and the Taiwanese TSMC (NYSE:TSM), which manufactures the wafers used in the latest generations of products. Xilinx's main competitor Altera works with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and TSMC, but is likely to work more and more with Intel as they were acquired by Intel a few weeks ago.Working with TSMC is the first strength that we recognize to Xilinx. TSMC is recognised as one of the strongest and most reliable semiconductor manufacturer (source). Xilinx has indeed a strong relationship with TSMC: it is telling to see how CEO Moshe Gavrielov is always very laudatory about TSMC in earning calls. For example in Earning Call Q3 2015, about the delay for 16nm: ""So there are no issues with TSMC, they are giving us full support (...) So it's not a TSMC challenge or issue at all"". Altera, which worked with Intel for the latest generations of FPGAs, said it was considering both TSMC and Intel for the next generation (10nm): It appears that Xilinx has a much better relationship with its foundries than Altera does, which gives an edge to Xilinx in this competition.Xilinx's position in the industry(Data from Google Finance and latest annual SEC fillings, PE and PS ratios are TTM)This table shows us an overview of the Semiconductor industry. It displays the main competitors of Xilinx in the FGPA industry, other fabless companies, and also some IDMs (Integrated Device Manufacturers).The sector is particularly heterogeneous: there are some big players such as Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Intel, but also a lot of more modest companies, which compete together. Xilinx is about the same size of its main competitor Altera, even though it has still higher sales, but a lower market cap. It has a strong net margin of 27.27%, way above the industry's average (21.65% for the above companies). The spending in R&D are about the same in proportion for all players at 20%-23% of the sales.The PE ratios are also very heterogeneous and range from 2.07 to 49.25. The average PE ratio is 25.52, somewhat above the 20.12 of Xilinx. In the FPGA industry, the average PE ratio is 34.54. Altera, the main competitor of Xilinx has much higher PE ratio, partly because of the announcement of the acquisition of Altera by Intel for $16.7bn. PS ratios range from 0.21 to 5.97, and the average PS is 3.61. Xilinx has a PS higher than the average, but if we only take into account the FPGA industry, we obtain a ratio of 4.29, which is close to Xilinx's. Once again, Altera has a very high ratio because of the acquisition announcement.Overall, Xilinx seems to be slightly undervalued: its share price could be higher without causing any abnormality in PE and PS ratios in comparison to its competitors.The returns of Xilinx over the last years are not awesome: it was beaten by Nasdaq, as well as by two of its direct competitors, Altera and Microsemi (NASDAQ:MSCC). The gap would have been much closer between XLNX and ALTR, had there been no rumors of acquisition of Altera by Intel during the previous months, and eventually the announcement of the huge $16.7bn transaction. Because of its modest returns, Xilinx was likely overlooked and we believe that it has a huge potential to go up and at least catch up with Altera in the medium run.RatiosOverall Xilinx is in a great financial situation: its operating margin are much higher than its debt charge, which imply a really low default risk, especially since the debt level is so low and most of it is long term.Xilinx has a lot of cash available that offers it flexibility for the future. It has an extremely safe balance sheet, with much more short term assets than liabilities.The profitability of Xilinx is disappointing, since both ROE and ROCE are approximately equal to the WACC, which mean no value creation for the firm. However, as we will see during the valuation part, the shareholder are widely rewarded by both shares buybacks and dividend.ValuationTo estimate the fair value of Xilinx, we use two discount models: the Dividend Discount Model (DDM) and the Gordon Growth Model (GGM). We considered 265,480,000 common shares outstanding.First, we need to calculate the different discount rates, i.e. the cost of equity (from CAPM) and the overall cost of capital. Using the 5 years T-bond rate as the risk free rate (0.164% per year) and the yearly return on the Nasdaq composite for market return, we obtain a market premium of 14.568%. We run a regression to obtain a Beta of 0.9246 for Xilinx's equity against the Nasdaq Composite. The result given by the CAPM is a cost of equity of 13.65%. Using the market cap as the equity value, the long term financial debt as the debt value, an effective tax rate of 12.41% and a cost of the debt of 5.57% (calculated from FY 2015 financial statements), we obtain a WACC equal to 12.997%.For the DDM model, we need to assess the total amount of cash flow used to reward shareholders, which is challenging, as more than two third of it is constituted by buybacks of common shares ($651,006,000), and the remaining part ($306,158,000) by dividends. Thus, we come across a situation where the total amount transferred to shareholders is higher than the net income, i.e. the payout ratio is higher than 1. We find $3.605 as the total amount per share paid to shareholders. This number has to be discounted by the cost of equity minus the estimated growth rate to obtain the fair value per share (see results below).The idea of the GGM model is to discount the free cash flow of the firm to obtain its fair value.Free Cash Flow calculations, using the same assumptions as for the previous calculations:(Source: Own calculations, data from Xilinx FY 2015 10-k)We obtain a FCFF of $886.550millions as of March 28th 2015. This result has to be discounted by the WACC minus the estimated growth rate, and then divided by the number of shares outstanding to obtain an estimate of the fair value per share.Results from DDM and GGM:(Source: Own calculations, data from Xilinx FY 2015 10-k)The fair value estimates obtained here have to be compared with the market price of a share, equal to 47.06 as of June 6th 2015.(Source: Own calculations, data from Xilinx FY 2015 10-k)Both the DDM and the GGM have approximately the same Internal Rate of Return IRR: g = IRR = 6%. That is, if the company meets at least an annual rate of return of 6% (either through its dividends or its free cash flows), then today's share price of $47.06 is undervalued, and investing in this company will result in a profit. Targeting a return higher than 6% for the foreseeable years seems to be a rather conservative assumptions. Thus, we believe that Xilinx is able to generate a significant profit for its shareholders as it ""only"" need to beat the 6% growth rate corresponding to the IRR. For instance, a 7% growth rate implies a fair/market value spread -and thus potential profit- of $7.15 (15.02% return) with the DDM, or of $8.63 (18.33% return) with GGM.With Xilinx announcing an increase of their Buyback by 33% in FY 2016, we are highly confident that their is a lot a profit to be made by investing in Xilinx today.GovernanceXilinx is a widely held company: the top shareholder only owns 8.8% of the stock, and together the 10 largest shareholders own about 40% of Xilinx's stock (according to Xilinx's website). It is therefore a good place for governance. The board is composed in a large majority by independent directors, who have a strong background in the Tech industry. In fact, Moshe Gavrielov, Xilinx's CEO, is the only insider among the eight directors. Xilinx established a very detailed and strict Code of Ethics for the directors and a detailed Code of Conduct for all employees and directors. Xilinx does have remarkable corporate governance standards.The directors (excluding Mr. Gavrielov) own collectively about $11.1 million in Xilinx's stock. The executives share about $12.7 million of Xilinx's shares. The CEO Gavrielov alone holds about $10 million in Xilinx stock, excluding options and other derivatives. This shows a great commitment from the supervisors and managers of the company, and confidence (as well as a huge incentive to perform) in the ability of Xilinx to generate great value for shareholders.Could Xilinx be the target of an M&A deal?The answer to this question is a strong yes: the semiconductor industry is boiling today, and the M&A activity is higher than ever. The later deals of Avago (NASDAQ:AVGO) buying Broadcom (NASDAQ:BCOM) for $37bn and Intel buying Altera for $16.7bn are a clear indication that big deals are likely to occur.The macroeconomic conditions for M&A are perfect today: the interest rates are very low and are expected to increase by september: now is the right moment to set up highly leveraged operations, whose costs will increase with the interest rates. The industry is consolidating, and Xilinx is a great deal: it has such a clean balance sheet that a LBO would be easier and safer.Xilinx is a very specialized player, focused on FPGAs and ASICs. Another big player could definitely be interested in this fabless company. Qualcomm is for instance a potential acquirer. Its CEO Steve Mollenkopf declared at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch 2015 Global Technology Conference ""I think we have the opportunity to participate in other diversification efforts. And I think one of the challenges for Qualcomm is how do we add significant businesses outside of the handset space that provides a diversity gain that I think we'll need.""If Xilinx was to be bought, we could expect a similar premium to Altera's, which was about 15%-25% depending on when we consider that investors anticipated the deal.Takeaways"
3243486,89396,2015-06-08T12:53:53-04:00,Now that Intel bought Altera what is Xilinx going to do?Will Xilinx do business as usual or they will they change their game?Advice from a long-time veteran of reconfigurable computing.,"Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is buying Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR). How does this affect Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) and what should they do about it? I have to admit that, until 2-3 years ago, I would have said Xilinx would get bought by Intel. After all Xilinx invented the modern FPGA. Xilinx is the market leader. Xilinx owns the university market along with the minds of future FPGA designers and programmers.Xilinx will now face Intel, not Altera in the market place. Both Altera and Xilinx each have around 3,000 people worldwide. Altera and Xilinx have similar business vital statistics with Xilinx having 60% market share to Altera's 40%. It was a duopoly. It won't be any more.Intel has over 100,000 employees. Intel's net income is 5 times more than Xilinx's total revenue and Intel's net income is over 18 times that of Xilinx. Today Intel has 2372 job openings 2/3's of the number of employees that Xilinx has.Is Xilinx doomed?Intel has the sales force to beat Xilinx everywhere. Intel can drop the margins on Altera FPGAs, without even rattling Wall Street. This allows Intel to undercut Xilinx on deals that they are currently competing with Altera for. Intel is the gorilla in the room and will eventually find Xilinx's lunch and take it.Is there any hope for Xilinx?What are the opportunities here?What Xilinx is missing?To be part of the mainstream big data server market is an x86 strategy. While ARMs are becoming popular, x86 had 73% of the server market in 2013. To be a player in the server market will require a mature respected x86 strategy.Xilinx should buy Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)AMD's market cap is only $1.8 billion and Xilinx probably has that much cash in hand. This would let Xilinx get in on the x86 + FPGA fabric tsunami that's about to come. AMD had just released their 6th generation CPU device that incorporated GPU. Xilinx has done the same. AMD and Xilinx have been smashing up different computing architectures and both have expertise in integrating a number of different IP blocks into single architecture.With Intel buying Altera there is a chance that Intel will break Altera management style. There is lots of politics at Intel and many at Intel don't like the idea of FPGA based computing. FPGAs architectures are quickly evolving architectures. CPUs not so much. Intel will slow down Altera's innovation rate. On the other hand if Xilinx buys AMD it's AMD who will have to speed up their innovation rate and that would be good for them.Xilinx could be in charge of its fate and look at this as an opportunity to change before the coming flood or it could just drown in a sea of Intel-Altera blue."
3071976,63483,2015-04-15T09:42:02-04:00,"Major tailwinds include - growth outlooks for the PLD & FPGA markets. New product concentration, continued pricing power, distribution concentration.Commitment to shareholders, geographic diversification.Debt load, FX unlikely to be a concern.Near-term weakness is to be expected, continued industry dominance.DCF indicates upside from current levels.","Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) manufactures PLDs (programmable logic devices) for the semiconductor industry. Major tailwinds include the high growth outlooks for the PLD & FPGA markets, relative to the broader industry. New product concentration is vital, due to the fact that older products tend to be commoditized very quickly by competitors, resulting in price erosion. The company continues to increase its pricing power, which should allow margin expansion in the near-term. Although the company has a distribution concentration, it is not an issue. The company's commitment to shareholders continues, while not neglecting important aspects of the business such as R&D and capital expenditures. Revenues, profits and cash flow are expected to be stable going forward, given the company's geographic diversification. Although the company has a high debt load, not only are most of its contractual obligations 3-5 years from maturing, the company holds a sizeable cash position. FX is unlikely to be a concern due to the company's sales model. Near-term weakness is to be expected, due to seasonality within certain end-markets. The company's continued industry dominance remains its largest competitive advantage, which should bode well for the future.Major tailwindsAccording to research, the global PLD market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 14.8% over the 2013-2018 period. This growth is driven by the device's superior functionality, compared to traditional alternatives. PLDs are reprogrammable, making them not only reusable, but also cost-efficient. The global FPGA market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 8.1% throughout the remainder of the decade. This growth is driven by the need to solve problems associated with the handling of big data. In the information age where data is ubiquitous, FPGAs are perhaps the best solution to this problem, thus, expect the demand for FPGAs to be secular. Xilinx serves both markets through its numerous product offerings as shown below.  Source: SEC FilingsAs the company sells extremely relevant products to the aforementioned PLD and FPGA markets, Xilinx is well-positioned to capitalize on the growth of these industries in the near-term.New product concentrationSource: SEC FilingsAs seen above, the company's revenues are heavily weighted towards its new products. Over the 2012-2014 period, new products comprised of 11%, 22% and 37% of the company's top-line in each of the respective years. This aspect of the business is significant due to the nature of the industry. Within the semiconductor industry, newer products tend to be able to command high ASPs, as they are typically more cost-efficient. As these products start to age (when even newer products are brought to the market), the once-new products will experience price erosion. Competitors eventually catch up, and the supply of the once-new products exceeds the demand by a large margin (as a portion of the demand has been shifted to even newer products), resulting in drastic price erosion. With this understanding, intuitive readers would be able to discern that a healthy concentration towards new products are a sign that Xilinx's innovations are keeping up with its rivals, and that the company is at little risk of experiencing large drops in its revenue base due to price erosion.Continued pricing powerSource: SEC FilingsAs seen above, Xilinx has managed to grow its gross margins over the 2012-2014 period. Gross margins grew from 64.9% in 2012 to 68.8% in 2014. As a company's gross margins increase, one can interpret this as the company being able to continually increase its pricing power, hence resulting in higher ASPs. Part of this increase in pricing power can certainly be explained by Xilinx's new product concentration. Another reason why the company has been able to steadily grow its margins is due to its dominance within the market. It's largest competitor within FPGA is Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR), who achieved slightly lower revenues compared to Xilinx in 2014. By holding a substantial share of the market, Xilinx continues to be the major supplier of PLDs and FPGAs, which puts the company in a better negotiating position compared to its smaller rivals. With the company continuing to lead the way in industry innovation, along with the fact that Xilinx is a market leader, I expect further profit margin expansion in the near-term.Distribution concentrationXilinx sells its products primarily to OEMs and EMSs. One of its largest distributors is Avnet, a company that I initiated coverage on recently. Avnet accounted for 55% and 64% of Xilinx's total accounts receivable in the years 2014 and 2013 respectively. Though the risk of having one single distributor account for such a large portion of receivables is undeniable, this risk is mitigated by the fact that Xilinx is still one of the largest, if not the largest player within the industries it serves. Also, recent data suggests that the company is slowly decreasing its sales concentration to Avnet, evident from the fact that Avnet accounted for a lower portion of total receivables in 2014 (55%) than 2013 (64%). Considering the secular trend of big data, FPGAs are here to stay. Hence Avnet has little reason to drop Xilinx as a supplier. Thus, any fears of revenue volatility are unfounded.Commitment to shareholdersThe company continues to be extremely dedicated to its shareholders, with most of its operating cash flow in recent years being diverted to rewarding shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Recently, the company declared a quarterly dividend of 2 cents per share, further demonstrating its devotion to keeping shareholders happy. However, the risk associated with rewarding shareholders becomes apparent when the company focuses more on the shareholders than the business itself. Lawrence Fink, CEO of Blackrock, recently commented that the mania associated with appeasing shareholders comes with the risk of neglecting operations, which may affect long-term business viability.Source: SEC FilingsFortunately, this is not the case for Xilinx. The company remains focused on its business first and foremost, evident from the increasing R&D expenditure as a percentage of sales over the 2012-2014 period. Ergo, the company seems to be able to properly balance its obligations towards the business and shareholders. Some companies, pressured by Wall Street or activists, become short-sighted in their goals and do not devote enough to R&D (for a company like Xilinx) or capital expenditures. As the effect on the business is not readily apparent, many glance over this aspect of a business. However, reduced reinvestment will eventually rear its ugly head, as companies either lose their competitive advantages or become obsolete over the long-term. It is for this reason (Xilinx's focus on R&D) that I am of the opinion that the company is a long-term play.Geographic diversificationSource: SEC FilingsXilinx's revenues are geographically diverse. As seen above, the company has consistently derived about a third of its revenues (20%-30%) from the largest PLDs markets (North America, APAC, and Europe). Having such diverse exposure in a geographic context cushions the company from region-specific recessions or downturns. Said another way, if Europe continues its trend of anemic growth, the effect on the company's overall revenues is dampened significantly. Furthermore, a diverse geographic footprint also ensures that the company's revenues, profits, and cash flow are more stable compared to its less geographically-diverse rivals.Debt loadSource: SEC FilingsAs seen above, the company's total contractual obligations are exactly $2b, a figure that is far greater than its EBITDA or operating cash flow. However, the company's liquidity position remains intact, thanks to its modest cash balance, and large hoard of marketable securities. Given the current low-rate environment, coupled with the company's strong liquidity and growing cash flow, the company could glean further tax savings from issuing additional debt. Most of its contractual obligations are far from maturity (more than 3 years). Hence in the near-term, the company could afford to make a sizeable acquisition of one of its smaller rivals, and still be able to pay or rollover its debt when they come due. Although the Fed has hinted at a possible late-2015 rate hike, borrowing costs should not become a material problem, given the fact that the company's interest burden currently amounted to an insignificant percentage of revenues (approx. 1% of sales). Thus, Xilinx remains in an enviable position cash-wise, with options to augment top-line growth through inorganic initiatives, or lower its cost of capital through further debt issuance.FX unlikely to be a concernIn recent months, many major U.S. corporations have been citing FX pressures related to the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar vis-à-vis other major currencies. This appreciation can be attributed to the diverging monetary policy stance taken by the Fed, compared to its central banking peers. Although the recent FOMC meeting has stemmed the appreciation of the greenback somewhat, the fact remains that the dollar currency index is still at elevated levels compared to a year ago. It goes without saying that such a development within the FX market has led to currency issues, with many major corporations blaming feeble growth on the dollar appreciation. Xilinx is somewhat immune to the strengthening of the dollar, as the company transacts with its distributors and resellers using the USD. Some may cite demand pressures arising from a stronger dollar, however if one considers the strong demand for Xilinx's products, it is clear that FX issues will merely pose a small problem for the company.Near-term weakness to be expectedIn the company's Q3 earnings call, CFO Jon Olson cited weakness within the wireless and broadcast end-markets. He further elaborates that the company expects wired and wireless communications to remain flat sequentially while the A&D end-market should experience headwinds. However, the key thing to note is that most of this weakness is temporary and can be explained by seasonality issues such as program-related timing within the A&D end-markets and FDD-LTE deployments. Long-term demand remains strong, and hence Xilinx should perform well over a 3-5 year period.Continued industry dominanceXilinx continues to lead the industry in terms of innovation. One example to illustrate this dominance is the company's 20nm offerings. The company recently began shipping the industry's largest FPGA which delivers four times the capacity of any competing device. This only goes to show how far ahead of the pack Xilinx is. The company estimates that it is one-year ahead in terms of innovation relative to its competitors. In earlier paragraphs, I mentioned that the company remains focused on the long-term viability of its business, evident from its increasing R&D expenditure. This should allow the company to remain the industry leader in innovation in the near-term, which should translate to further increases in pricing power, and ultimately, meaningful expansion in profit margins.ValuationAs seen in the above DCF model, company revenues are expected to grow at growth rates of 3% to 9% throughout the 5-year projection period. This growth is supported by the bright prospects of the PLD and FPGA markets which Xilinx operates in, along with the company's continued industry dominance and new product concentration. Overall top-line growth for FY15 is projected to be a mere 3%, due to the seasonality and low-growth issues cited by management. Beyond FY15, the company is expected to recover to its usual levels of revenue growth in the high single-digits, before tapering off slightly at the end of the projection period.EBITDA margins are expected to gradually expand to 38% throughout the projection period. This expansion in margins is supported by the fact that the company's continued industry dominance and new product concentration allows it to derive a substantial amount of pricing power, evident from its continued improvement in gross margins. Xilinx's dedication to the long-term, which can be seen from its increasing R&D expenditure, should allow the company to continue staying ahead of the pack in terms of innovation, allowing for sustained margin expansion.The company currently trades at 10.9x LTM EBITDA. Using this figure, along with a 9% discount rate (due to the company geographic diversification, healthy balance sheet, and strong secular demand for its products), the model produces a fair value of $57.50 for Xilinx, indicating that the company is undervalued by approximately 30% at current price levels. This number might be too low, considering that Xilinx's main competitor, Altera, currently trades at higher EBITDA multiples, pre-Intel announced-then-cancelled-buyout. Considering that Intel cancelled negotiations to buy Altera, Xilinx remains an attractive candidate for a takeover, which could lead to further upside. My outlook on Xilinx is therefore bullish - investors are advised to initiate a long position on the stock."

The Defensive Investor is only concerned with the high PB ratio, while the Enterprising Investor has no initial concerns. Therefore, all value investors should feel very comfortable proceeding to the next part of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.From a valuation side of things, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $1.64 in 2011 to an estimated $2.14 for 2014. This is a strong level of demonstrated growth, and is in line with the market's implied estimate for earnings growth of 4.85% over the next 7-10 years.

2008621,34471,2014-02-10T13:26:53-05:00,,"Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR) and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) are locked in a heated rivalry for dominance of the field programmable gate array (FPGA) market. Based on ongoing discounted cash flow analyses of both companies, I believe that Xilinx is breaking out as the victor of this rivalry.Why Am I Writing This ArticleI am a practicing engineer, but not the type that would know anything about semiconductors or embedded systems. A reader of my DCF Hub blog (who IS very familiar with FPGA) noticed that both Xilinx and Altera fell within my universe of stock valuations and expressed interest in hearing a more in-depth analysis. I am happy to oblige.Tom Armistead wrote an interesting article on the rivalry between the two companies last month with a differing opinion.Field Programmable Gate ArraysFPGAs are powerful integrated circuits utilized in a variety of embedded systems. FPGAs have been around since the 1980s but until recently usage has been limited to niche markets, primarily defense spending. However, FPGAs have been increasing in processing power and speed and decreasing in price, and they are starting to take significant market share away from microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICS). As the market leaders within the FPGA niche, Altera and Xilinx both stand to benefit from this transition.Valuations and Valuation HistoriesI have been calculating valuations for Xilinx and Altera (along with many other companies) weekly over the past year using a discounted cash flow analysis based on analyst consensus growth rates.This is my most recent calculation for Altera:Recent Price: $33.69From this earnings projection, a market discount rate of 7.4%, and Altera beta of 1, I have calculated the net present value.Feb. 7 NPV: $25.56Valuation Percentage: 132%The chart below shows how this valuation has changed over the last year. The blue line represents the calculated net present value and the orange line represents the weekly price.NPV Change Since Feb. 22, 2013: -9.9%Here are the same calculations for Xilinx.XLNX:Recent Price: $46.10Based on this earnings projection, the market discount rate of 7.3%, and Xilinx beta of 0.97, I have calculated the net present value.Feb. 7 NPV: $40.02Valuation Percentage: 115%NPV Change Since Feb. 22, 2013: +38.4%Neither company is particularly overvalued or undervalued at present, but Xilinx's valuation has increased substantially over the last year and Altera's has not. In my experience, it is often better to invest in a company with an upward trending fair value than one that is currently undervalued.Xilinx May Be an Emerging Gorilla, But Altera Has A Shot With IntelThere is a persistent belief that new technology markets are a ""winner take all"" environment. This is because of the need to standardize. Once a chip (or any component, or platform) has been established as a standard, it is very difficult for BSP engineers, and they are unlikely to even consider using a competing product. If Xilinx becomes the clear market leader in a trendy emerging technology, for example the ""internet of things,"" the market will reward it disproportionately.This principle, and the investing dynamics, was popularized by Geoffrey A. Moore in his classic ""The Gorilla Game"". Gorilla game investing is a discipline in-and-of itself, but one of the key things to look for is early design wins in high profile projects that may set a standard for future developers.So let's look at some of the more discrete verticals within the internet of things to see what FPGA solutions the tastemakers have embraced.Wearable Computers: Invensense (NYSE:INVN) MEMS gyroscopes power many next generation wearable products, including Google glasses, and exercise equipment like the Fitbit. According to this job posting, Invensense uses the Xilinx ISE. Additionally, Xilinx CFO Jon Olson sits on the Invensense board of directors.Rasberry Pi and Beaglebone Black: These cheap development computers are influential because they are aimed at the early educational and hobbyist market. They are what the next 12-year old prodigy is likely to be using. The startup Valent F(x) launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to create the Logi FPGA board for these computers. The Logi uses a Xilinx Spartan 6 FPGA.Circuits For 3-D Printed Objects: I did a quick search for designs on Autocad 123D Circuits. I found two using Xilinx products and none for Altera.So, overall, it appears that Xilinx is emerging over Altera as the standard FPGA supplier for next generation projects. But Altera does have some recent wins.Altera recently signed a fabrication deal with Intel (INTC) to produce next generation ARM chips. Intel is still the most powerful chipmaker on the planet, and I am excited about Intel's Edison project. Although Altera may not be involved with the Edison, and this deal does not necessarily indicate a deeper relationship.Altera also announced a strategic partnership with Intel subsidiary Wind River last week to deliver tools for Altera's ARM system on a chip platform.There May Be No Winners Here, Or Anywhere Else, For Several YearsMarkets have been weak throughout 2014, and in my opinion the broad market is still expensive. The market has fallen a bit and the discount rate has risen a bit since I complained about it in my last article, but I think we have further to go. I'm looking for the market discount rate to rise at least above 8% before I start looking for new bullish positions, and that is a minimum. 10-12% is more realistic for a true market bottom.Additionally, technology markets are highly cyclical, and I think the current excitement over web 2.0, tablets, and smartphones needs to die off before the market can start getting excited about wearables, the internet of things, and FPGA.All else being equal, a rise in the market discount rate to 10% would cause the NPV of Xilinx to fall to $28.92, an ~28% drop. The same macro correction would cause the NPV of Altera to fall to $18.50, also an ~28% drop. Note that I am calculating these drops based on the current NPV, and not the current price, as I believe both of these stocks could maintain a slight premium in a market crash.Looking ahead to 2015 and beyond, Xilinx looks like it could be a big winner in the next technology cycle. Altera looks like a fair value, but there doesn't appear to be as much upside potential as there is for Xilinx.Avoid A Pairs TradeOne thing I wouldn't do is attempt a long-short pairs trade with Xilinx and Altera. Market leadership can change, and a pairs trade would magnify the loss if Altera surprises. It is usually better to be long both or short both competitors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

It strives to lower cost and power consumption at each manufacturing process node.Fiscal year 2015 marked a record gross margin of 70% for the company, up a full percentage point from the prior fiscal year. That's a phenomenal level of profitability.We like the company's free cash flow generation and cash-rich balance sheet. Xilinx's dividend has solid growth potential, in our view.Let's take a look at the firm's investment considerations as we walk through the valuation process and derive a fair value estimate for shares.","By The Valuentum TeamXilinx's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) makes FPGAs, SoCs and 3D ICs. These devices are coupled with a next-generation design environment and IP to serve a broad range of customer needs, from programmable logic to programmable systems integration. The company was founded in 1984 and is headquartered in California.• As with rival Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR), which was recently acquired by Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Xilinx's strategy centers on the displacement of ASICs and ASSPs in the development of next-generation electronic systems. The company strives to drive down cost and power consumption at each manufacturing process node.• Investors in technology pay close attention to a firm's gross margin to get a read for product pricing pressures. Fiscal year 2015 marked a record gross margin of 70% for the company, up a full percentage point from the prior fiscal year. We like the company's focus on growing earnings and its extremely cash-rich balance sheet.• The company is experiencing solid momentum in the 28nm market. Xilinx's quarterly revenue run-rate is expanding, and the firm ended fiscal 2015 with $580 million in 28nm revenue. Difficult broadcasting and communications end markets may cap firm-wide sales growth, however. Sales are expected to be flat in the March 2016 quarter on a sequential basis.• Many are speculating that Xilinx will be next to be taken out by a larger partner. Even if this never happens, the company is executing nicely on a standalone basis. Xilinx continues to have nice things to say about new product sales, and its 7-Series and UltraScale families continue to perform well.• The company is heavily dependent on distributor Avnet (NASDAQ:AVT) for the majority of sales revenue and order fulfillment. Resale of product through Avnet accounts for 40%+ of worldwide revenue and for two-thirds of total net accounts receivable. We think investors should be aware of this concentration, if only because it is part of the business.• Free cash flow generation, as measured by cash flow from operations less all capital spending, is by far Xilinx's most attractive attribute. The company spends ~$6-$10 million in capex in any given quarter while it pulls in hundreds of millions in operating cash flow.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital.The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Xilinx's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 121.9%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 10.2%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of excellent.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid gray line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.Companies that have strong economic profit spreads are often also solid free cash flow generators, which also lends itself to dividend strength. Xilinx's dividend cushion ratio, a forward-looking measure that takes into account our projections for future free cash flows along with net cash on the balance sheet and dividends expected to be paid, is strong at 3.1 (anything above 1 is considered strong).Cash Flow AnalysisFirms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Xilinx's free cash flow margin has averaged about 30.9% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively strong.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Xilinx, cash flow from operations increased about 20% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 2% over the same time period.In the first 9 months of fiscal 2016, Xilinx reported operating cash flow of ~$607 million and capital expenditures of ~$19 million resulting in free cash flow of ~$588 million, a ~2% decrease from fiscal 2015.Valuation AnalysisThis is the most important section of our analysis. Below, we outline our valuation assumptions and derive our fair value estimate for shares.Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Xilinx's shares are worth between $35-$53 each. Shares are currently trading at ~$47, in the upper half our fair value range. This indicates that we feel there is slightly more downside risk than upside potential associated with shares at this time. Cash-rich equities sometimes are bid up by the market.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $44 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 18.7 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 12.1 times last year's EBITDA.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 2.9% during the next five years, a pace that is higher than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 2%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 31.3%, which is above Xilinx's trailing 3-year average.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Xilinx, we use a 10.2% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisOur discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $44 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Xilinx. We think the firm is attractive below $35 per share (the green line) but quite expensive above $53 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Xilinx's fair value at this point in time to be about $44 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Xilinx's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $56 per share in year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $44 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Wrapping Things UpXilinx's focus on driving down cost and power consumption at each manufacturing process node is noteworthy, and the company put its operating prowess on display in fiscal 2015 when it reported a record gross margin of 70% as product pricing pressures let up. The firm ended fiscal 2015 with $580 million in 28nm revenue, compared to $380 million in fiscal 2014, which has helped Xilinx's quarterly revenue run-rate expand. Difficult broadcasting and communications end markets may cap firm-wide sales growth, however. In any case, we're big fans of the company's robust free cash flow generation and cash-rich balance sheet, and Xilinx's dividend cushion ratio of 3.1 suggests the dividend is solid.

1994721,24757,2014-02-05T05:58:52-05:00,,"Many technology investors know about the rivalry between Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Relatively few know or understand the rivalry between Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) and Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR). The difference is that Intel and AMD are brands that are associated with PCs, for which there is consumer awareness. Xilinx and Altera make PLDs (programmable logic devices), which are incorporated into many non-consumer (and some consumer) electronic devices. You don't see their brands highlighted in stores.Yet as the PC market has shrunk the PLD market has held up and even grown in some market segments. PLD growth seems likely to continue. Here I'll focus on Xilinx's Q4 2013 results and its likely performance in 2014, with implications for the direction of the stock price.While there are other players in the PLD market, Xilinx and Altera revenues can act as a proxy. In Q4 2012 their combined revenues were $949 million. In Q4 2013 combined revenue was $1.041 billion, an increase of 9.7%. Contrast the combined revenue of AMD and Intel, which was $14.7 billion in Q4 2012, but $15.4 billion in Q4 2013, up just 4.5%. Intel did worse, with Q4 revenue up just 3% from Q4 2012.Xilinx had Q4 revenue growth (from year-earlier) beating both the (mainly) x86 / PC graphics trends and the PLD trend rate. Revenue was $587 million, up 15% from $510 million in Q4 2012. However, it was seasonally down 2% from $598.9 million in Q3.On a GAAP basis, Xilinx net income was $175.9 million, up 24% sequentially from $141.5 million, and up 70% from $103.6 million in the year-earlier quarter. Diluted EPS (earnings per share) was $0.61, up 24% sequentially from $0.49, and up 60% from $0.38 year-earlier.The stock price has reflected, at least in part, the success. Xilinx had a 52-week high on 1/22/2014 of $48.91. The 52-week low was $34.98 on 4/19/2013.There are a number of specific trends underway that could to be examined to determine if Q4 is a fluke that will revert to some lesser mean, or if it is an indicator of continued strong revenue and profit growth. For Intel, most revenue comes from x86 processors, and subsectors of the market are servers, desktops, notebooks, tablets and smartphones. In contrast Xilinx markets cover 3 broad industrial segments: Communications and Data Center; Industrial, Aerospace & Defense; Broadcast, Consumer, and Automotive; and other.Xilinx has a number of product lines, but in general they cut across the end-customer segments: Virtex, Kintex, Artix, and Spartan are all FPGAs (Full Programmable Gate Arrays). Zynq is an SoC (System on Chip) that includes both an FPGA and dual ARM microprocessors. Using Kintex as an example, some of its applications are in avionics, displays including 3D TVs, LTE (4G wireless) baseband stations, and various video applications including high-end cameras. The ability of PLDs to be programmed at the hardware level gives them an advantage wherever there is a need for speed combined with a limited set of repetitive calculations to be made, as when there is an audio or video data stream being processed.Breaking out end-use segments by dollars for Q3 and Q4 2013 we can see the short-term trends against the seasonally slower Q4:Two sectors differed substantially from the seasonal sequential drop. Industrial, Aerospace and Defense saw a drop of 4.6% that may have more to do with the sequester and government shutdown than with long-term demand. It is a segment that should be monitored, since it accounted for 37% of Xilinx revenue in Q4.Communications and Data Center is the largest segment, accounting for 44% of revenue in Q4, and did well against a background of slightly negative seasonality. The key variable within the segment at this time is PLDs for 4G base station rollout. PLDs can be used in smartphones, but those tend to be low-end PLDs because they only need to handle single-device bandwidths. Base stations need to be able to handle signals to and from numerous phones, so the newer models tend to be designed in when possible.Currently, while 4G is still being rolled out in the U.S. and Europe, the big rollout is in China, where it began in earnest in Q4. The main source of incremental wireless sales within the Communications segment was 4G in China. However, segment sales were broad-based, with continuing sales into other nations and 3G. The Chinese rollout of 4G base stations is going to take several years; it should not just be a Q4 spike. 4G rollout is mostly in the future in developing nations, including India, so the demand picture looks quite good for the foreseeable future.Another way to dissect Xilinx revenue is by the age of the product families. Base products are the oldest, and were typically designed into products 2 or more years ago, though they could be used when low-cost components are needed in new designs. They represented 26% of revenue in Q4. Mainstream products have been around for a while but are no longer cutting-edge; they represented 33% of revenue. New products like the Zynq 7000 are still being added to many new device designs in, but they have ramped to 38% of revenue. The remaining 3% of revenue comes from software, support and services.Process nodes are as important to the PLD industry as they are to the rest of the semiconductor industry. Xilinx's newest products are at 28 nm, but 20 nm products are now being sampled. Generally lower nanometers means more processing capability with lower power requirements per instruction executed. Xilinx reported that 28 nm products are ramping faster than expected and hit over $80 million in Q4.In general the trend appears to favor PLD revenue growing faster than overall semiconductor revenue, though not as fast as ARM chip revenue has grown since the introduction of smartphones. Usually the main concern about Xilinx is that it might lose market share to Altera. In 2013, however, Xilinx revenue grew faster than Altera's (15% growth vs. 3% growth, Q4 to Q4).Altera's argument for future market share gains lies mainly in its plans to go to Intel's 14 nm process for the next node, while Xilinx will use TSMC's (NYSE:TSM) 16 nm node. Intel's node is likely to be ready earlier and in theory can pack in more transistors on any given die size. However, there are a lot of variables that determine the choices end customers make. Since both companies still get most of their income from nodes above 28 nm, and are just introducing 20nm products, the 14 nm vs. 16 nm is not likely to have much impact on revenue until 2016. Until engineers can see what these future designs can do, the most probable assumption is that PLD industry-wide sales trends will be more important than any small market-share jockeying between Xilinx and Vertex.I don't see any highly probable reason Xilinx revenue would not continue to grow in a 10% to 15% annual range in 2014. Neither does Xilinx management: guidance for the March quarter is sales between $598 and $622 million, which would be up 2% to 6% sequentially. Macroeconomics could affect demand, but while some analysts see China as struggling, I would be surprised if the 4G rollout gets held up.Since we are in a market dip it is a particularly good time to eye Xilinx for addition to portfolios. At the February 3 closing price of $45.02 Xilinx has a market cap of $12.0 billion at, and a dividend yield (at $1 per year, $0.25 per quarter) is 2.15%. Xilinx went ex-dividend on February 4. It has a trailing P/E ratio of 21.1, which is reasonable given growth prospects in 2014.However, Intel currently has a P/E ratio of 12.7 and a dividend yield of 3.7% (at $23.95). So to an extent the gloom about Intel and hopes for Xilinx have been priced into the market.Disclosure: I am long AMD. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

2572905,24757,2014-10-19T02:34:32-04:00,"Going into September quarter results, Xilinx was a battered stock.The gloom was mainly due to the slow pace of China LTE deployment.EPS Rose 27% from the year-earlier quarter.","Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) reported September quarter results on October 16, and the stock got a pop the following day, closing at $41.05. But Xilinx was already far off its 52-week high of $55.29 hit on March 21, 2014. It had slumped to its 52-week low of $36.24 on October 13, 2014.Before presenting an analysis of how Xilinx is likely to do going forward, it would help to recall the complex moving parts of Xilinx's end markets this last year.When Xilinx reported its December 2013 quarter results (its fiscal Q3), revenue was up 15% y/y and diluted GAAP EPS was $0.61, up 60% from year-earlier. Xilinx's guidance for the March quarter was for a sequential revenue increase of 2% to 6%.There were two stories driving the good news. Xilinx makes PLDs (programmable logic devices) that are used to process data, particularly the streams of data for wireless communications, and for specialty industrial, medical, aerospace and even some consumer equipment. A new line of devices was ramping. They were based on 28 nm (nanometer) silicon processes, and replaced older 40 nm devices.More important than the 28 nm device ramp was the China LTE 4G cellphone network ramp. While companies that make ARM-based processors have competed for the LTE cellphone slots, Xilinx makes FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) that go into the cellphone infrastructure, the base stations and radio units that go into cell towers. This ramp was going about as expected in the December quarter. Xilinx predicted its wireless segment would break records in the March quarter.In the March quarter everything got better. Revenue was up 5% sequentially and 16% y/y, driven by continued strong 28 nm device sales and China LTE sales. In addition Xilinx estimated it captured 70% of sales in the 28 nm market, getting a leg up on arch-rival Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR). Guidance for the June quarter was for revenue to increase between 0% and 4% sequentially.China LTE ShortfallBut drawing straight lines on graphs does not always work out in the real world. When June quarter results were reported in July, some things had changed. The results were revenue was down 1% sequentially, and only up 6% y/y. The stock price dropped from a $48.15 close before the announcement to close at $41.26 on July 23, 2014, down 14% in a single day. What had gone wrong in the quarter, and was the gloom and doom over Xilinx's future justified?Two of Xilinx's end markets had suffered unexpectedly weak demand: defense and China LTE. Of course, China LTE was what was supposed to drive the future. Defense, we know, can be erratic as weapons contracts come and go, and volumes adjust to reality. Xilinx called the China LTE sales decline an inventory correction.But rival Altera did not see the China LTE decline that quarter, and had quite a good June quarter. So many investors and analysts reasoned that there was some sort of Altera over Xilinx victory, which would continue into the future. Altera will report on its September quarter on October 23.Since then we learned that while sales into China LTE can be lumpy there was no loss of design slots by Xilinx. Instead there was a shortage of another component, power amplifiers, needed to build base stations and radios. Since Xilinx had been able to ship on time, in the March quarter, a backlog resulted. As OEMs have been able to get the amplifiers, they have been buying Xilinx parts to meet the demand, but at a slower-than-anticipated pace. If Altera did better, it is likely because their particular OEMs had better stocks of amplifiers.Which means that LTE demand has not gone away for Xilinx, it is just being spread out over time. Also, Xilinx sells into the global LTE rollout. When China has done the bulk of their LTE rollouts, there will still be rollouts in India and other nations.There was one more event that spooked the semiconductor market, including Xilinx. That was the Microchip guidance miss, preliminary September quarter report issued on October 9. Microchip's CEO claimed he could see a broad inventory correction in the semiconductor industry, based on his own company's miss. What he forgot to say was Microchip had strong y/y revenue growth even though it missed guidance. Following reports by Intel and now Xilinx, the money would be on Microchip having simply issued overly optimistic September quarter guidance.Of course, the semiconductor industry serves numerous consumer and business end markets, so the September quarter will likely have some losers in among the winners, not because those firms don't have great technology, but because some products were produced that did not sell through. The same as every quarter.After the Microchip announcement, Xilinx dropped from a close of $40.19 to a bottom close of $36.27 on October 13, another 10% drop.September Quarter ResultsXilinx's results and the analyst conference on October 15, 2014, after the market closed, were a relief. The view of the stock had become so negative, results did not need to be spectacularly positive. They just hit the upper end of guidance, with revenue essentially flat sequentially and flat y/y, but GAAP diluted EPS flat sequentially and up 27% y/y.In the September quarter China LTE sales were again light, but no need to panic, they are just waiting for those power amplifiers. Since margins are lower than average for new LTE deployments, the weak LTE resulted in higher-than-expected gross and operating margins. There was a $2 million tax credit that helped EPS. Aerospace and Defense segment demand was strong in the quarter; these older devices have better-than-average margins.Going forward, there can always be more surprises, both upside and downside, but Xilinx looks ready to prosper. 28 nm parts are expected to recover strongly in the December quarter, and Defense should be strong in the quarter, but it is not clear when China LTE will ramp back up again. Wired and wireless communications outside of China are expected to ramp. The overall guidance for December is revenue up between flat and 4% sequentially.For long-term investors, Xilinx offers a highly profitable business model that is very shareholder friendly. Xilinx has cash ($3.55 billion end of quarter), generates cash (operating cash flow $204 million last quarter), and returns cash to shareholders. The dividend is currently $0.29 per quarter, or about 3% per year at the current price, which used $77 million cash in the quarter. Another $200 million of cash was used to repurchase stock in the quarter, which increases EPS over time.Looking two quarters ahead is a bit risky, but usually the March quarter is seasonally slower than the December quarter. Unlike companies that sell chips mainly into the consumer market, Xilinx does not have a big holiday rush. Defense spending is expected to stay strong through March, but then taper in the June quarter. 28 nm products should continue to ramp throughout 2015, and 20 nm products are already sampling.Although I take competition statements by Xilinx and Altera with more than a grain of salt, Xilinx reports ""At the 20 nm node, independent customer feedback indicates we have an approximately one year lead over the competition."" If true, this should drive market share gains, though more in 2016 than 2015."
2597065,25791,2014-10-25T15:22:36-04:00,,"By Chaith KondraguntaXilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ:XLNX) reported its preliminary financial results based on which we provide a unique corporate earnings release based analysis of its performance. Our analysis focuses on the company's performance for the same quarterly period on a year-on-year basis (unless stated otherwise).XLNX is one of the first companies amongst its peer group to announce earnings for this period.HighlightsThe table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income (See complete table at the end of this report):Revenue Growth Versus Earnings GrowthCompanies sometimes focus on growing their top-line (Sales or Revenues) more than their bottom-line i.e. Earnings or Net Income. Investors should look at revenue growth to understand a company's ability to grow its market share, and earnings growth to look at the company's ability to generate returns. Comparing revenue growth to earnings growth helps understand a couple of items: (1) A company's focus on gaining market share vs. generating profits and (2) How additive or dilutive the revenue performance has been to earnings. XLNX's year-on-year change in top line compared to the same period last year of 0.89% trailed its change in earnings which was 21.25%. The company's performance this period suggests some efforts to help the bottom-line earnings. It remains to be seen how the rest of the peer group results turn out and if XLNX's performance suggests any major shift in the composition of market share in this sector. Also, for comparison purposes, revenues changed by -1.37% and earnings by -1.21% compared to the immediate last quarter.Earnings Growth TrendThe company's earnings growth has been influenced by the following factors: (1) Year-on-year improvements in gross margins from 72.22% to 74.68% and (2) better cost controls. As a result, operating margins (EBITDA margins) improved from 35.27% to 36.25% year-on-year. In addition, gross margins were 71.77% and EBITDA margins 36.75% in the immediate last quarter.Gross Margin TrendCompanies sometimes tradeoff for improvements in revenues and margins by extending friendlier terms to customers and vendors. One quick way to check against such activity is to compare the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is quite possible that the company's performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply a prop up using the balance sheet.The company's improvement in gross margins have come at the expense of a deterioration in working capital management, suggesting that the improvements in gross margins are likely trade offs with the balance sheet and not strictly from operating decisions. Its working capital days have gone up to 343.98 from last year's levels of 172.53 days.Operating Cash Flow Growth Versus Earnings GrowthCompanies often post earnings numbers that are influenced by non-cash activities. One way to gauge the quality of the declared earnings number is to judge the deviation in the growth in earnings from the growth in operating cash flows. In general, an earnings growth rate that is higher compared to the operating cash flow growth implies a higher proportion of non-operating and even one-time activities - such activities are typically not sustainable over long periods. XLNX's year-on-year change in Operating Cash Flow of -20.03% trailed its change in earnings suggesting some potential weakening of the balance sheet.Unusual ItemsThe company's earnings growth has also been influenced by the following factors: (1) Improvements in EBIT margins from 32.12% to 33.11% and (2) unusual items. The company's pretax margins are now 32.16% compared to 25.51% for the same period last year.EPS Growth Compared To Earnings GrowthXLNX's year-on-year change in Earnings per Share (EPS) of 26.53% is better than its change in earnings of 21.25%.Supporting DataThe table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and other relevant metrics:Company ProfileXilinx, Inc. designs, develops and markets programmable devices and associated technologies, including: integrated circuits in the form of programmable logic devices, including programmable System on Chips and three dimensional ICs, or 3D ICs, software design tools to program the PLDs, targeted reference designs, printed circuit boards and intellectual property, which consists of Xilinx and various third-party verification and IP cores.

728981,21711,2012-07-18T08:56:40-04:00,,"Xilinx (XLNX) is scheduled to report Q1 results after the bell tonight, and analysts surveyed by Capital IQ are expecting earnings per share of $0.45 on revenue of $573.5 million.XLNX is drawing an investor following on either side of the trade after its earnings report.XLNX has leaned toward a pattern of widening price moves between the after-hours and regular session following 17 of its past 32 earnings-related events. Near term, the stock has narrowed the last four consecutive quarters.The stock has recorded an earnings-driven upside move in 16 of the last 32 quarters in our database. It posted a more aggressive upside move the next day in nine of those events, or 56% of the time. On the downside, XLNX has recorded 16 earnings-driven after-hours declines, and added to its downside move eight times the next day, half the time.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
1571692,24757,2013-07-25T13:13:00-04:00,,"It has been a good year for Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) investors, with the stock recently remaining near the 52-week high of $46.54 hit on July 18, 2013, and almost 52% above the 52-week low of $30.25 on July 24, 2012, almost a year ago.I've found that Xilinx products are poorly understood by many investors. In general Xilinx makes PLDs, Programmable Logic Devices, like rival Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR) and others. CPUs and many other semiconductor chips are programmable, but the difference is in the nature of the programming. CPUs and programmable ASICs (application specific ICs) have instruction sets burned in during manufacturing. They can't change their instruction sets, but are programmed by software directing which instructions to execute. In contrast PLDs consist of arrays of elements (logic gates and memory) and the ability to configure the connections between elements after manufacturing. An engineer can make two originally identical PLDs do two very different things by configuring them differently. Unlike CPUs which usually accomplish a wide variety of tasks (spreadsheets, photo touchup, databases), PLDs can be programmed to do one thing repeatedly and very rapidly, like deciphering a cell phone signal. ASICs can do that too, but every time you make a change you have to redo the manufacturing process.The most notable financial peculiarity of the PLD space is high margins compared to many semiconductor companies. Xilinx had a GAAP gross margin of 69% and an operating margin of 33% in Q2 2013 (its first fiscal quarter 2013). Competitor Altera had a gross margin of 68% and operating margin of 26.6% in the quarter.Checking the basics, on a GAAP basis revenue was $579.0 million, up 9% sequentially from $532.2 million, but down 1% from $582.8 million in the year-earlier quarter. Net income was $157.0 million, up 20% sequentially from $130.6 million, and up 21% from $129.8 million year-earlier. Diluted EPS (earnings per share) were $0.56, up 19% sequentially from $0.47 and also up 19% from $0.47 year-earlier. [See Xilinx Fiscal Q1 2013 press release]That looks good against the major competition, since Altera's revenue was $421.8 million, up 3% sequentially from $410.5 million but down 9% from $464.8 million in the year-earlier quarter [See Altera Q2 2013 press release]. This could represent a major competitive disadvantage, although Altera management has stated they believe Xilinx's current advantage will turn into a negative in 2014 mainly due to Altera's new alliance with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and the nature of the addressable markets at the new process nodes.Guidance is for revenue to be up 0% to 3% sequentially, which is disappointing. The September quarter should be seasonally stronger than that. However, growth of the newest, 28 nm (nanometer) products is expected to remain strong.One reason for strength in the June quarter was demand in aerospace and defense, which is not likely to increase much in the September quarter.One potential upside is from wireless LTE technology deployments by China Mobile. So far Xilinx has shipped only prototypes, and the bidding process between OEMs and China Mobile has not closed. So while shipments to this market could increase in late Q3, revenues are more likely to start ramping in the December quarter, or possibly in 2014. [per Xilinx analyst call, July 17, 2013]I believe that rapid changes in technology, including segmentation, favor increased use for FPGA (field-programmable gate array) technology, and other types of PLD, over time. Both Xilinx and Altera seek to remain on the cutting edge of PLD/FPGA development, and they both have their fans in the OEM world. In 2014 we will see a battle of process technologies, but keep in mind that overall design is usually more important unless there is a big difference in process technologies, which there won't be. Also note that while 14 nm, 16 nm, and 20 nm parts may be introduced in 2014, much of the industry is still transitioning to 28 nm parts.I also like the potential increases integration of other IP with PLDs, as we see in the Zynq parts, which include ARM cores along with the programmable logic.I have a generally favorable impression of Xilinx, but with its closing price on July 23, 2013 of $45.83, barely off the 52-week high of $46.54 (as opposed to a 52-week low of $30.25 one year ago today), and a P/E ratio of 24.3, I am more inclined to watch the stock than to buy it. It does have a dividend of near 2.2%, which would provide some insurance against a price decline, which I like. The company also has a buyback program.As I continue to study PLD products and end markets I will be looking for less obvious growth opportunities versus ASICs (Application Specific ICs, or regular, pre-programmed chips). The rivalry between Xilinx and Altera is important, but with both companies claiming their new products will win them market share, I am cautious about making bets on the claims this far in advance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1073181,34841,2012-12-20T11:53:56-05:00,,"My favored technology plays for 2013 are primarily in the semiconductor and software names. Semiconductors have maintained poor performance in 2012, dragged down by slow growth in Asia and Europe. Within semiconductors, Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) and Broadcom (BRCM) are my favored companies. Xilinx is my top selection based upon its leading industry position, strong free cash flow generation, and 15% annualized dividend growth. Here are my complete nine key criteria for any potential stock selection:Key Selection CriteriaFirm Description & CapitalizationXilinx is the world's leading provider of semiconductors, specifically programmable logic devices (PLDs) including FPGAs, SoCs and 3D ICs. PLDs are pre-manufactured chips that are left blank, allowing engineers to program their functionality using software. The company is the top supplier of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs). Xilinx also offers a wide range of design software and intellectual property that is utilized by manufacturers to customize purchased chips. The primary market for these chips are automotive, aerospace/defense, broadcast, consumer, and wired and wireless communications markets. Major product lines include the Spartan, Artix, Kintex, Virtex, and Zynq device families. Xilinx currently has a market capitalization a hair below my $10 billion requirement.LeadershipThe market for PLD chips is a duopoly, with Xilinx and competitor Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR) controlling nearly 90% of the total market. With 47% market share, Xilinx is the industry's #1 PLD Supplier.InternationalSource: Xilinx Annual ReportInternational revenue has remained a large portion of Xilinx's revenue and has continued to accelerate. It has risen from 61% of total sales to 70% today. Growth in overall revenue had stagnated from 2008 to 2010, but in fiscal 2011, Xilinx's total revenue grew by over nearly 25%, the highest growth rate in nearly a decade. Xilinx generates 41% of its total revenue from Asia Pacific, including 10% of that figure from Japan. Europe accounts for 27% of revenue.Balance Sheet/FCFSource: Xilinx Annual ReportThe balance sheet of Xilinx is in good shape and its credit rating has been increased twice this year by Standard & Poor's Ratings Service. In March, S&P lifted Xilinx Inc.'s investment-grade credit status a notch higher to triple B plus. S&P cited the ""chip maker's strong cash flow and improving business prospects,"" and indicated ""Xilinx's customer base will grow faster than the broader semiconductor industry as more manufacturers switch to programmable devices that offer lower development costs and a faster time to market."" Free cash flow generation has been exceptional, growing from $403M in 2008 to $757M in 2011. This is a total growth rate of 87%. Cash and investments increased $61 million to approximately $3.2 billion in the last reported quarter. One unique aspect of Xilinx is its convertible debt. Xilinx has issued two convertible notes. In March 2007, Xilinx issued $1.00 billion principal amount of 3.125% Junior Convertible Notes due 2037 (""2007 Notes""). In 2009, Xilinx repurchased $310.4 million of aggregate principal amount of these 2007 Notes. In June 2010, Xilinx issued $600 million principal amount of 2.625% Senior Convertible Notes due 2017 (""2010 Notes""). The outstanding balance of the two notes as of Q2-13 was approximately $915 million. However, Xilinx has hedged the potential dilution of conversion by purchasing call options on the common stock.Relative ValuationAs for relative valuation, I have a preference for price/sales ratio when examining the merits of a technology company. Xilinx is trading toward the middle of its range in history in terms of price to sales. Xilinx has traded at a price/sales ratio range of 2.3 to 6.4 since 2004.The average price/sales ratio since 2004 has been 4.1. Sales per share have doubled for Xilinx over the preceding decade, rising from just above 4 to nearly 9 in 2012. During that same time period, the share price of Xilinx has dropped from $40 on January 5, 2004, to $35 today. Xilinx's share price has suffered through ""valuation compression."" Earnings per share have also advanced, rising from 0.85 cents in 2004, to an expected $1.95 this year. Despite the doubling of both sales and earnings over the preceding eight years, Xilinx's stock price has stagnated primarily due to the high starting valuation measures left over from the dotcom bust of the early 2000s.At the current pace in sales per share growth, Xilinx could present investors with attractive capital gains. Sales per share growth is both driven by increased revenue and/or reduction in shares outstanding. Shares outstanding in Xilinx have remained constant since 2008. Although the company has bought back 68 million shares for approximately $1.8 billion since 2008, it has been offset to a large degree by compensation grants. However, this should change over the ensuing few years, as the Board of Directors of Xilinx recently ramped up the authorization to repurchase up to $750 million of its common stock, or approximately 8 percent of its outstanding shares. If Xilinx can deliver by doubling the amount of stock repurchased over the next several years, it should reduce overall share count even with further compensation grants.With its new products in the rapidly expanding 28-nm market (see below) and accelerated share repurchase plan, I expect Xilinx sales per share to advance from nearly 9 to just over 12 by 2015. Based upon an average 4.1x price/sales ratio, my expected price for Xilinx would be $49.61 a share within a three-year time frame. This would result in a $13 capital gain profit based on today's price of $35 a share. Importantly, this does not include dividends, which will be an additional component to total return for Xilinx investors.DividendsThe Xilinx Board of Directors announced in November a quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per outstanding share of common stock, payable on November 28, 2012, to all stockholders of record. The increase in quarterly dividend, for the eighth consecutive year, resulted in a 0.88 cent annual dividend for Xilinx shareholders. One of the strong merits of Xilinx is its consistent dividend growth. Dividends have risen fourfold since the inception of payouts in 2004. Xilinx also demonstrated its preference for raising dividends even during the tumultuous economic period of 2008.Source: Xilinx Annual ReportXilinx only pays out 38% of its net income in dividends, thus offering room for further expansion of its annual payouts. If Xilinx continues to raise dividends by 15% per annum, dividend payments would be $1.01 in 2013, $1.16 in 2014, and $1.33 in 2015. This would result in an additional collection of $3.50 in dividends over the three-year period. Added to my target price based upon price/sales analysis ($49.61), appreciation from both capital gains and dividends could result in a total return of nearly 50%. This also does not include reinvested dividends. Building wealth through dividend growth and reinvestment of dividends is a strong methodology for outperforming the markets over time.Analysis & Future CatalystsXilinx will need to deliver an annualized 6.5% growth rate in overall revenue over the next three years to hit my sales per share targets. Thus, in order to deliver upon a sales per share of just over 12 by the end of 2015, revenue must grow from 2369M to 2880M. I am assuming that stock buybacks will slightly contribute toward reducing the amount of revenue generation needed, and will account for a reduction in shares outstanding from 272M at present to 250M by the end of 2015. This should be a conservative assumption even with the convertibles, given that Xilinx just announced a 8% total share repurchase plan for 2013 and also maintains hedges against convertible conversion.I am of the opinion that Xilinx can meet my financial targets through its strong positioning within the PLD market and new products developed through its high R&D spend ratio. Xilinx and Altera are the two stalwarts within the industry. The PLD market has grown much faster than the traditional semiconductor market over the past decade. Competition to the PLD market comes from the ASIC chip market. Over time, the transformation to PLD from ASIC shifts as chips become smaller and smaller; initial setup costs for manufacturers grow ever larger. With ASIC chips, the manufacturers must bear a higher start-up cost. For example, the cost of setup for the older 45-nm SOC chip design was estimated to be roughly $80 million. The setup cost for the smaller 32-nm SOC is about $120 million, whereas the cost for the most recent design (28-nm) is now $170 million (chart)Source: Xilinx Analyst Meeting 2012Thus it has become more costly to design chips as components become smaller and smaller. ASIC customers either have the option of covering the increase in costs over time as chip size decelerates, using less advanced chips, or moving to smaller PLDs. Shifting to higher-end, lower cost PLDs should become a more attractive option over time.Within the PLD market, Xilinx has released its new 28nm chip. In the most recent quarterly earnings release, new product sales increased 7%. Growth in new products at Xilinx was driven by the 28nm adoption and resulted in the company meeting its $20 million quarterly revenue goal. Xilinx CEO Moshe Gavrielov has recently commented that this new node can grow at an annual rate of 8%-12% out to 2020. One advantage that Xilinx maintains over its competitor in this market is its broad portfolio, including its Zynq FPGAs and the Virtex-7 H580T 3-D heterogeneous FPGA. Due to its broad base of products, Xilinx seems to be winning approximately two-thirds of business in the 28-nm platform category on a total dollars basis.Xilinx projects to spend nearly $500 million on research & development in 2013, a sizable portion of total revenue. New products through R&D are the lifeblood of Xilinx. In the most recent quarter (2Q13), Xilinx's new products (including Virtex 7, Kintex 7, Zynq-7000, Artix 7, Virtex 6, and Spartan-6, product families) generated 20.0% of revenue, up 81% from the prior year. The new 28-nm product line should lead the new product cycle across a wide platform of industries. The company has a strong position in the LTE market. LTE stands for Long Term Evolution, marketed as 4G LTE, and is the standard for wireless communication of high-speed data for mobile phones and data terminals. Although LTE will not replace the older 2G-3G market overnight, the shift will play out over the next several years. Xilinx is making a big push in LTE through its large research facility in Hyderabad, the capital and largest city of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. The Hyderabad facility is the largest research and development project outside of the company's headquarters in the United States. In March of this year, Xilinx moved to bigger premises in Hyderabad to accommodate new product development. Xilinx has over 400 employees at this research center. The center has grown from 75 employees since its opening in 2006.Defense will also be a large growing market for Xilinx. The company maintains half the market share of the aerospace/military PLD market. The area brings in nearly 15% of Xilinx revenue. Xilinx recently demonstrated four new members of the 28-nm Xilinx-7 family in defense-grade versions, The Artix-7, Kintex-7, Virtex-7, and Zynq-7000 product lines offer new security features required by federal agencies like the National Security Agency. Although acquisitions have not been a large part of Xilinx's growth, niche purchases have been utilized to better round out the firm's product portfolio. Xilinx this year acquired Modesat Communications to strengthen its position in wireless backhaul. Wireless backhaul is the use of mobile communications systems to get data from an end user to a node in a major network such as the Internet or the proprietary network of a large business, academic institution or government agency. These are the backbones that connect base stations and metro switching stations in a wireless network. As large manufacturers are looking for complete backhaul solutions, Xilinx should be in a good position in win additional business.For the quarter ended September 29 , 2012 (Q2-2013), Xilinx beat expectations on earnings per share. Earnings per share came in at $0.46. The 24 earnings estimates compiled by S&P Capital IQ anticipated only $0.41 per share. This earnings beat came despite weaker revenue. The revenue miss was due to several factors, most notably economic uncertainty in global markets and some inventory burn at its largest customers.Xilinx has now surpassed analyst estimates for four quarters in a row. It beat the mark by 2 cents in the Q1-2013 quarter and by 8 cents in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year. I expect Xilinx can continue its earnings momentum through 2013. The firm has new product revenue acceleration thorough its 28-nm product line and should benefit widely from a recovery in Asia. Xilinx has an improving relationship with large Chinese vendor Huawei. Xilinx was recognized for excellence in technology leadership, quality and product delivery at Huawei's Annual 2012 Core Partner Convention in Shenzhen, China. This relationship looks to improve in 2013 through more design wins and market share gains from Altera. Overall, Xilinx has a leading, robust new product cycle in 28-nm, maintains a solid balance sheet, produces exceptional free cash flow growth, and pays a rapidly growing dividend. I expect Xilinx's share price to advance to $41 by the end of 2013 and to nearly $50 a share by 2015.Disclosure: I am long XLNX, BRCM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

585501,24866,2012-05-14T03:04:26-04:00,,"Given all of the excitement surrounding technology IPOs, many investors are struggling over how to divvy up their portfolios. Semiconductors provide an ideal way to play the sector's positive secular trends given that they are indirectly linked to most tech end markets. In this article, I will run you through my DCF model on Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) and then triangulate the result with a review of the fundamentals against Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). I find that Xilinx is meaningfully undervalued.First, let's begin with an assumption about the top-line. Xilinx finished FY2011 with $2.2B in revenue, which represented a 5.4% decline from the preceding year. I model 8.6% per annum growth over the next half decade or so.Moving onto the cost-side of the equation, there are several items to consider: operating expenses, capital expenditures, and taxes. I model cost of goods sold eating 35% of revenue versus 15.5% for SG&A, 18% for R&D, and 2% for capes. Taxes are estimated at 18% of adjusted EBIT (ie. excluding non-cash depreciation charges to this a pure operating model.We then need to subtract out net increases in working capital to get free cash flow. I estimate this figure hovering around 0.5% of revenue over the explicitly projected time period.Taking a perpetual growth rate of 2.5% and discounting backwards by a WACC of 10% yields a fair value figure of $41.08, implying around 25% upside.All of this falls within the context of strong performance despite a challenging environment:From a multiples perspective, Xilinx also has some momentum. It trades at a respective 16.7x and 14.1x past and forward earnings versus 16.7x and 15.5x for Altera and 19.8x and 12.9x for TI.Consensus estimates forecast Altera's EPS forecast declining by 27.2% to $1.71 in 2012 and then growing by 26.9% and 15.2% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 16x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $2.14, the stock would have very little upside. In light of this weak return, I believe investors will shift over to Xilinx as the economy improves. 24 of the 27 revisions to EPS have gone down for a net change of 3.6%. With that said, the company is still led by an impressive management team.And then there is heavyweight TI. Consensus estimates forecast TI's EPS declining by 18.6% to $1.80 in 2012 and then growing by 32.8% and 18.8% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 17.5x, a deserved premium, and a conservative 2013 EPS of $2.36, the stock would hit $41.30 for 34.4% upside. TI offers a dividend yield of 2.2% on top of this sizable value discount. Accordingly, I recommend opening long positions in this leading semiconductor.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: We seek IR business from all of the firms in our coverage, but research covered in this note is independent and for prospective clients.

This can be a wonderful source of investor revenue, and with each dividend payment received, investors are able to lower their risk in an investment. Many investors will buy a stock in part because of the dividend and the current yield. The one basic requirement to receive a dividend payout from a company is to be a shareholder on the day of record for the dividend.There are several dividend harvesting approaches. Some are better than others. The trick is to minimize the amount of risk, and still have an edge. This is one of my favorite, and easiest to understand, methods of making gains with options and dividends. I get asked often how long I normally hold the position before closing out. On average I enter into a position with the idea I may hold it for a month with the current numbers here. Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ:XLNX) designs, develops, and markets programmable platforms in North America, the Asia Pacific, Europe, and Japan. The company is based in San Jose, California.Xilinx, Inc. Yield: 2.11%  Dividend Amount: $0.19 Ex-Dividend Date: February 06, 2012 Beta: 1.03Here is a look at the fiscal year revenue:I research the different call options and calculate the expected probabilities based on Beta, Bid, Offer, Volume traded the current day, open interest, and time value / implied volatility. The options offer some level of protection from possible down moves in the stock, and provide revenue to cover the times that the options do not fully cover down moves in the stock. Income is not needed from the option premiums, so a break even from option premiums received/stock losses ratio is a win.I generally hold any given position for about three weeks. I use a few methods that produce consistent results and covered calls have proven to provide gains when work and effort are applied. With the gains made, I am able to stop out and take a loss with the few that do not work out as planned. When learning a new trading strategy it is better to use a simulated trading account first. It is easy to make mistakes when starting out on a new strategy, and mistakes cost a lot less with a simulated account. After a level of confidence is built, then it may be time to move into a real money account. In this article we will go over an upcoming dividend with Xilinx that I may capture with a minimum amount of risk. The criteria that I use is that I must be able to sell a call option in either the front, or first back month that is in the money, and with enough premium that I will not mind getting exercised early (which happens often and can be a good thing if the trades are executed correctly).StrategyIn combination with my buying Xilinx stock and after checking company updates, offer to sell the February $35.00 strike call for $0.43 over the intrinsic value. The option may get exercised early for a gain. In almost all cases I will sell the call option first to ensure the stock option leg is complete first. If not, after qualifying for the dividend, I will attempt to close out the trade with a gain of near $0.13, plus the dividend earned. It is important to sell the call option hedge at or near the asking price for at least the minimum amount over intrinsic value. I will not want to try putting on the hedge unless the sale of the option (hedge) will provide at least the full $0.43 over intrinsic value. If my shares get called away the day before they trade ex-dividend as a result of the option buyer wanting the dividend I will make about $0.43 Not all that great, but not bad for about a week of owning the stock. The most I can make is $0.62 if I hold the covered call through option expiration day and the stock gets called away. My last step (completed before making a trade on the same day) is to check company announcements and news sources for possible events that may cause the stock price to move. This is especially important during earnings season.

316392,20568,2011-12-28T17:29:25-05:00,,"Earnings estimates for Xilinx Inc. (NASDAQ:XLNX) have declined significantly in the last seven days after the company recently downgraded its guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2012.Xilinx recently revised its sales guidance for the December quarter. The company now expects sales to decline by 9% – 12%, significantly lower than the previous guidance of a sales decline of 3% to 8% sequentially.The new guidance implies sales to come between $488.6 million and $505.2 million compared to its previous estimate of $538.5 million and $510.8 million.The decline in sales was primarily driven by a decrease in large customer business in the Communications end market. Xilinx now expects gross margin to be approximately 65%, up from its previous estimate of 64%. This is a revision from previous guidance of approximately 64%. With the second quarter earnings conference call, Xilinx stated that sales from Virtex-6 and Spartan-6 families will increase sequentially. Sales from Communications were projected to be down sequentially as decline in wireless sales would offset an increase from Wired Communications. Xilinx had reduced its guidance for the September quarter as well. Most semiconductor companies have downgraded their guidance for the December quarter in view of the macroeconomic slowdown, with the exception of Broadcom Corporation (BRCM).Earlier in the month, prime rival Altera Corporation (NASDAQ:ALTR) slashed its revenue guidance for the fourth quarter of 2011.Altera now expects revenues in the fourth quarter to decline by 13% to 16% on a sequential basis, compared to its previous guidance of 7%–11%. The new guidance implies revenues in the range of $438.9 million–$454.6 million, significantly lower than the previous guidance of $465.0 million–$485.9 million.In particular, the severe weakening of demand in Europe has majorly affected business for most semiconductor players.Industry leader Texas Instrument (NASDAQ:TXN) also slashed its revenue guidance for the December quarter as demand was adversely impacted with most customers bringing down their high-level of inventories. The company stated that the reductions are due to broadly lower demand across a wide range of product markets, customers and end products, the only exception being wireless applications processors. In particular, the recessionary environment in Europe continues to impact the business, followed by Asia and the U.S.Earnings estimates have already declined of late for Xilinx. With the downgrade in guidance, we expect a more severe decline hereafter.We continue to maintain a Neutral recommendation on Xilinx. Our recommendation is supported by the Zacks No. 3 Rank, which translates into a short-term rating of Hold."

With a small collection of chip company earnings in hand, it does look like the long-await recovering in semiconductors is at hand. As is so often the case, though, the markets have anticipated the reality and Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) shares have been bid up to something less than a full bargain.An Encouraging Third QuarterCertainly a little context is important when looking at Xilinx's report. For starters, while it was an encouraging report, results were still at the lower end of original (before the late-quarter revision from management) guidance range. It's also important to remember that sales were down - down 8% sequentially and 10% from last year.Like most companies with strong operating leverage, it cuts both ways. With lower revenue, gross margin contracted almost two points sequentially though close to flat on an annual comparison. Further down the line, operating income was down 11% sequentially and 25% annually on a GAAP basis; stripping out amortization and restructuring charges doesn't change much.The Refresh That Ends The PauseWhen Xilinix's peer Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR) warned the Street of lower earnings back in December, management said that they thought the market was bottoming. Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) echoed this sentiment, and both companies suggested that customer orders were below end-market ship rates and that inventories were getting very low.It seems like that's holding true. Although sales to the communications and industrial markets were both down this quarter (9% and 7% respectively on a sequential basis), management pointed to improving orders in these markets. That basically corroborates similar reports and guidance from Linear Technology (NASDAQ:LLTC) and leading chip fab Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM).Here's the note of the caution - rebuilding inventories will only last so long. End-user demand needs to pick up for this to be a real recovery. To that end, guidance from companies like F5 (NASDAQ:FFIV) has been supportive, but what Xilinx really needs to see is a resumption of telco spending on base stations, backhaul, and networks. If companies like China Mobile (NYSE:CHL) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) get back to spending on network upgrades, that will ignite the demand at OEMs like Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), Alcatel (ALU), and Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) that Xilinx really needs to see.Still A Strong Long-Term Trend StoryEven if the 2012 recovery takes a little longer to play out, there are good fundamental reasons to own Xilinx for the long haul. Together with Altera, the companies largely dominate the programmable logic device market [Lattice (NASDAQ:LSCC) is a weak sister and Microsemi's (NASDAQ:MSCC) Actel is narrowly focused on flash-based products for the low-power and military markets]. As PLDs continue to displace ASICs over time, that leadership position should be worth more and more.In the short run, Altera has the lead in the 40nm space (holding more than 60% share), but Xilinx looks like it's coming back strong in 28nm. Odds are the companies will continue to trade leadership back and forth through product generations with neither company holding a commanding edge.The Bottom LineIn the short run, the biggest risk is that this recovery is just short-term inventory restocking that fades out in the wake of growth struggles in Europe and China. Longer term, it would stand to reason that Altera and Xilinx should see more competition either within PLDs or from a different approach altogether - it's just not too common for companies to produce these kinds of returns and cash flow for the long term.For now, though, Xilinx shares have rebound enough that they aren't necessarily the best chip cycle recovery play. Broadcom (BRCM), Atmel (NASDAQ:ATML), or Microsemi could all be more attractive in that regard. Thinking about the bigger picture and the longer term, though, it's hard to argue against these shares. The company already pays a good dividend and has a compelling leadership in a growth market with at least some barriers to entry. Trading maybe 25% below full-cycle fair value, Xilinx makes for a tempting addition to quality tech stock portfolio.Disclosure: I am long (MSCC)."

It works hand in hand with many of its industrial customers to design and manufacture bespoke solutions to technology needs, though it also offers ‘off the peg’ products. Unlike other semiconductor and chip manufacturers, such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Xilinx markets wholly to business and industrial customers, from aerospace and defence to consumer and medical electronics.Xilinx Inc is currently trading around $30, and the mean 12 month price target from analysts researching the stock is $33.10 (10.3% upside potential). This stock is trading around its 50-day exponential moving average of $30.09 and lower than its 200-day exponential moving average of $31.06. Earnings per share for the last year were $2.37, though these are expected to fll to $2.20 in its next fiscal year (ending Mar 2013). These numbers place the shares on a trailing price to earnings ratio of 12.49, and a forward multiple of 13.45.For investors looking at dividend paying stocks, Xilinx’s payment of a dividend of $0.76 last year gives the stock a yield of 2.50%, and is covered more than 3 times by its earnings.When compared to competitor companies, this dividend is comparable to the yield of 2.2% given by Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), though less than that given by the daddy of the industry, Intel Corp at 3.6%. Altera Corporation’s (NASDAQ:ALTR) 1%, seems to be a token gesture (this is covered more than 8 times by its earnings), and Lattice Semiconductor (NASDAQ:LSCC) pays no dividend. Xilinx has paid dividends since 2004, and increased its dividend in every year.Current operating margin is 32.89%, with a return on assets of 12.59% and a return on equity of 29.20%. The current revenue from its income statement is $2.39 billion, and last quarter’s revenue showed year on year growth of 3.50%. XLNX has cash of $1.97 billion, and a total of $894.5 million in debt. The company’s debt/ equity ratio is 35.78, similar to TXN’s 32.08, but higher than ALTR’s 17.50, and INTC’s 4.50. Looking at the chart below, XLNX shares have performed better than the broad S&P 500, but marginally worse than the shares of its much larger rival Intel. Results will be the driver of the share price here, and the company has done all it can to dampen expectations in a soggy market place, releasing what seems to be lowered guidance at every opportunity. The shares have retreated in line with the weakening equity market since July, and whilst showing more volatility than the index are now tracking its movement.[Click to enlarge]Whilst writing this analysis, the company released its latest quarterly earnings for its second quarter ended October 1. These show a decline in net income to $0.47 per share, a fall of 26%, whilst revenues decreased by 10%. The income figure was, however, better than the market consensus of $0.44 per share. Its sales were impacted by falling demand from its industrial customer base as business conditions worsened across the economy.The company now expects its revenue to decline a further 3% to 8% in the current quarter, translating to a number between $510.8 million to $538.6 million, as against analysts’ previous expectations of $570.8 million.Xilinx has stated time and again over the past few months that it expects sales to come in weaker than previous expectations. It is fighting against a tide of weakening demand in a weakening economy. I expect a price battle to develop in the chip industry, and this will further erode margins at a company where costs are falling at a far slower pace than revenues. The market reacts positively to numbers that beat expectations in the short term.At the moment Xilinx has managed those expectations well, and managed to produce well received poor numbers. I expect the next results to be on the low side of management’s estimates, and the market to react accordingly. I consider XLNX shares a SELL.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

In particular, sales of Virtex-5 (one of its new products) recorded outstanding growth and exceeded $100 million.Earnings per share (EPS) came in at 40 cents, easily beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 35 cents per share.Positive GuidanceFor the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, management expects sales to be up 3% to down 1% sequentially. This implies a revenue guidance of $508.2 million – $528.7 million. Once again, Virtex-5 is expected to be the growth driver. Sequentially, sales in Europe are expected to increase, but sales in all other regions are expected to be flat. Growth for mainstream products is forecasted to decline as most customers already have their inventories saturated.From an end-market perspective, sales from the communication market is expected to be up slightly while industrial and other markets are expected to be flat.On the third quarter conference call, management was upbeat about the recovery it saw in its business with broad-based strength across all major end-market categories.The company continues to build upon its Virtex-5 success to deliver the next generation of FPGA product, Virtex-6 and Spartan-6. Virtex-6 is in volume production and Xilinx is already shipping the product.On the other hand, Spartan-6 is the industry’s only 45 nanometer high volume FPGA with embedded transceiver technology. This is the key technology for Xilinx because it makes the business far more competitive in the high-volume arena.Gross margin for the fourth quarter is projected at 64% – 65% compared to 64.1% in the previous quarter. Xilinx had earlier experienced supply constraints and was unable to meet demand in fiscal 2009, leading to a decline in margins.The primary factor that led to constraints in the supply chain was the ramp-up of foundries from a very low utilization to a high utilization level, resulting in production inefficiencies.Management stated that the supply issues are now behind the company, and margin improvement continues to be a key focus area.Estimate Revisions TrendEstimates for Xilinx have been revised upward by most analysts, following the issuance of strong guidance by management and a strong recovery in the semiconductor space.Over the past 30 days, 4 of the 21 analysts following the stock have raised their earnings estimates for fiscal 2010 with no movement in the opposite direction. However, one analyst revised his or her estimate downward over the past 7 days.Overall, 2010 estimates are up 1 cent. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is $1.21, with an upside potential of 2.48%.Xilinx has consistently exceeded its guidance. On an average, Xilinx has beaten the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 12.36% over the last four quarters.Bookings continue to be strong as chip sales have been on the rise after a weak first half of 2009. Xilinx expects all the secondary end markets to recover above the peak June 2008 levels over the next year.Earnings are also on the rise for fiscal 2011, with 6 of the 21 analysts following the stock raising their estimates over the last 30 days and no downward revisions. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2011 is $1.76, up 4 cents over the last 30 days.Coming to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, we note that 3 of the 22 analysts covering the stock have raised their earnings estimates over the past 30 days with one analyst moving in the opposite direction.The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the upcoming quarter stands at 44 cents, with an upside potential of 2.27%.We believe the company’s growth will re-accelerate, given the competitive advantages of the company’s 90-nm and 65-nm technologies as well as the recent signs of economic recovery, which are expected to boost capital spending in 2010."
166546,20568,2009-10-14T16:05:20-04:00,,"Xilinx Inc. (XLNX) is expected to report its second quarter results Wednesday. Last month, the company had upgraded its guidance for the quarter. It expects quarterly sales to be up approximately 10% sequentially due to the broad based strength across all end markets and geographical divisions. Xilinx expects to ship most of last quarter’s delinquencies in the September quarter. Management reiterated its gross margin guidance of 61%. Operating expenses are estimated to come around $175 million, including $5 million in restructuring charges. California-based Xilinx designs and manufactures a broad range of high-performance, high-density programmable logic devices (PLDs) for electronic equipment manufacture. Earlier, rival Altera Corp. (NASDAQ:ALTR) reported its quarterly results that matched expectations. Sales of $286.6 million were down 20% from a year ago but up 3% sequentially. Management stated that business conditions improved steadily during the quarter and most markets performed better than expected due to a combination of new program ramps, improved end market demand and an increase in customer orders due to inventory depletion. The world’s largest chipmaker – Intel Corp. (NASDAQ:INTC) − beat Street expectations and stated that demand for PCs has rebounded stupendously. This signals that the semiconductor sector is all set for a strong recovery in the second half of 2009 after a significant decline in demand and inventory correction in the past twelve months. It seems Xilinx is poised to benefit from this broad-based growth after ironing out its supply constraints that had led to a revenue decline in the previous quarter. We believe the company’s growth will reaccelerate, given the competitive advantages of the company’s 90-nm and 65-nm technologies as well as the end to the inventory correction in the industry. We maintain our NEUTRAL rating on the stock."

100043,21445,2008-10-15T12:18:06-04:00,,"Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) is expected to report Q2 earnings after market close Wednesday, October 15 with a conference call scheduled for 5:00 ET. The consensus estimate is 37c for EPS and $482.09M or revenue, according to First Call. Management has provided guidance for Q2 of revenues to be down 3% to up 1% QoQ , or $473.5M to $493M; with gross margins of 63% to 64%. The company highlighted that it continues to maintain leadership in leading-edge products and currently has 90% of design wins at 65nm, and expects see the benefit from the share gain with time. The company also plans to introduce its 45nm product in late CY08. The company believes WiMAX and LTE (Virtex-5) are strong areas of future growth vs. ALTR. Deutsche Bank's estimates for 2Q are revenues of $483.4M (down 1% q/q) and EPS of 37c. Deutsche expects that Xilinx will report revenues in-line with company guidance and will lower Q3 forecasts versus Street estimates of 39c and $492.3M. Deutsche would prefer to remain on the sidelines in the shares given the lack of growth in the past few years and the weakening macroeconomic environment. Baird's recent checks indicated networking revenues declined 20% in the September quarter sequentially. Based on current order patterns, Baird says, networking revenues are expected to be down another 10% sequentially in the December quarter, which is about 15% to 20% below industry expectations. Baird said that translates into an estimated $20M in revenue shortfall for the second-half of this year, leading the firm to believe the company could come at the lower end of the revenue guidance range for the September quarter, and guide flat to down for the December quarter. Key issues for the call: Overall company guidance and details on expectations for growth in the communications segment; commentary on the margins; and an update on Xilinx's share repurchase plan. Next Event: Xilinx's industry-leading programmable logic solutions enabling automotive applications will be showcased at Convergence 2008, October 20-22 in Detroit, Michigan."
41790,20171,2007-07-20T10:52:59-04:00,,"Xilinx, Inc. (NASDAQ:XLNX) announced net revenues of $445.9 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, up 1% sequentially from the prior quarter and down 7% compared to the same quarter a year ago. First quarter net income was $84.3 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. The 1% sequential sales gain was at the low end of the guidance management gave when they admitted that the original guidance was too high. Earnings per share of $0.28 were a penny below the consensus estimate. For what it’s worth, Xilinx also issued guidance for the September quarter (and it also looks pretty bleak): Given their track record on earnings guidance, I’m not sure why they bothered.

28332,20171,2007-02-28T16:03:21-05:00,,"For some reason, the latest fashion appears to be issuing convertible notes. The practice allows companies to reduce the apparent share count, but assuming the share price rises (which stockholders are presumably rooting for) the shares will just come right back. We’ve seen this with Ceradyne (CRDN) and Finisar (NASDAQ:FNSR), and now Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) prices $900 million 3.125% convertible debentures: At recent share prices, the company should be able to buy back between 32 and 33 million shares with the proceeds. If the company does well and the shares rise above $31.18 before 2037, the company will then exchange the bonds for approximately 29 million shares. So, for a net reduction of 3-4 million shares the company will be paying a 1.725% premium (the convertible yield less the dividend yield on the stock) for 30 years. The additional interest expense relative to the dividends that would otherwise be paid amounts to $15.5 million per year. That would allow the company to buy 600,000 shares annually at the current price, which would give them the same net share reduction after just 5 or 6 years rather than the 30 year term of the convertible bonds. Or alternatively, the company could buy back shares with the $300 million it used in the December quarter to increase its balance of short term investments. That would allow them to buy back 11.5 million shares and retire them permanently, never having to worry about the dilution again, and never incurring the interest payments on the debt. Over time, that would quadruple the net share buyback and they would recover more than 100% of the initial outlay in interest savings over the life of the convertible. If, for some reason, the company then failed to generate sufficient cash flow to run its operations (which appears to be an unlikely outcome) they could always then turn to the convertible securities market for a cash injection. Of course, the company won’t have to reissue the shares if the stock does not rise above $31.18 by 2037. But we’re pretty sure shareholders aren’t interested in that potential outcome. No matter how you slice it, it is hard to see how this deal is positive for existing shareholders. XLNX 1-yr chart:"
33637,20171,2007-04-26T11:00:28-04:00,,"Analysts were expecting the company to earn $0.23 on $441 million in sales. In our own preview we called it: It turns out that risk was to the upside. The company also issued the following guidance: Let’s see… carry the three… looks to be about $0.29 on $457 million in sales, which compares favorably to the previous consensus guesstimate of $0.25 on $453 million. Xilinx thus becomes the first semiconductor company reporting this quarter (that we’ve noticed) to earn its likely strength in today's stock market. With both accounts receivable and inventories down sequentially, we even believe their comments that things are looking up for them. XLNX 1-yr chart:"
16910,20307,2006-09-14T16:28:49-04:00,,"You know that old saw about “buy on the rumor, sell on the news?” Well, I’ve discovered a corollary to that rule. With bad news, it seems to be the other way around. Or at least that’s the case when it comes to last night’s news on Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX).
A refresher: Xilinx last night lowered its guidance for the September quarter, and now expects revenue to drop 4%-7% sequentially from the June quarter, rather the previously expected flat-to-down 5%. The company blamed weaker-than-expected sales in the Asia-Pacific region.
So, uh, why is the stock rising? I went poring through a big pile of Xilinx research from this morning seeking an answer. What I found was that no one seemed surprised by the reduced outlook, and no one has really changed their opinions. The bulls are still bullish, the skeptics still skeptical. Some excerpts:
Well, ok, I still can’t quite explain the stock’s rise; but it certainly seems like a positive sign regarding the Street’s sentiment on semiconductor stocks. Xilinx shares today gained 87 cents to $22.41."
22099,20307,2006-12-11T01:02:00-05:00,,"Xilinx (NASDAQ:XLNX) shares took a beating Friday following the company’s disclosure Thursday night that fourth quarter sales would be down 2% to 5% sequentially, rather than 2% to 5% sequential gain the company had previously expected.
As you would imagine, more or less every Xilinx analyst on the Street chopped their profit forecasts for the company, and many reduced price targets. The most dramatic move came from J.P. Morgan’s Christopher Danely, who dropped his rating on the stock to Neutral from Overweight. Danely notes that communications supply chain inventory was 89 days in the third quarter, above a normal 85 days, which he says contributed to the trouble at both Xilinx and Altera (NASDAQ:ALTR), which issued a sales warning of its own earlier in the week.
Danely says Xilinx’s book-to-bill ratio is running at less than 1.0 - in other words, their shipments are higher than orders. “[G]iven the inventory in the communications supply chain and declining margins, we believe there is more risk to our estimates,” he wrote in a research note. Danely points out that the stock, now trading at about 26x his calendar 2007 estimate of $1.07 a share, could go to the low-end of its historic range of 20x-35x next 12 months earnings."

The consensus estimate is 35c for EPS and $481.89M for revenue, according to First Call. Cowen expects Xilinx to report Q1 results roughly at the mid-point of the company's guidance range provided on April 23, of down 1% to up 3% sequentially. Based on Cowen's recent channel checks, the firm believes that demand trends are relatively normal, inventory levels are healthy, and backlog coverage continues to improve. While the communications end-market is expected to be up for the June quarter, Cowen still remains concerned as its industry channel checks continue to show mixed data for this end-market. Thus, heading into Q2, Cowen expects management's guidance to be roughly in-line with their and Street consensus expectations. Consensus for Q2 is 36c on $482.97M in revenue. Key issues for the call: Overall company guidance and details on expectations for growth in the communications segment; possible margin expansion in the June quarter; and an update on Xilinx's share repurchase plan."

(NASDAQ:XLNX) released its business update for the June quarter of fiscal 2008. I was impressed when Xilinx originally issued their guidance, and now I know why it looked so good - it was wrong. The slower sales fits in with overall industry trends. The higher gross margin fits in with my look at inventory trends.

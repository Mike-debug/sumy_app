4378906,102661,2020-10-13T15:39:00-04:00,"In spite of pandemic-related office-closures, Xerox still managed positive FCF in Q2 and expects positive FCF through the end of the year.
        With at least $300M of share repurchases planned before the end of FY '20, management remains committed to shareholder returns including the dividend whose yield presently hovers around 5%.
        The company’s post-sale business model offers operating characteristics that provide protection for the dividend, even in light of current circumstances.
        With Carl Icahn “doubling-down” on his Xerox bet recently, income investors, skittish to invest in this old “legacy” name, may wish to take a second look.","In August, activist investor Carl Icahn recently doubled-down (metaphorically speaking) on his investment in Xerox (XRX) and now holds more than 25M shares, or ~12% of the company (based on 213M shares outstanding). His initial stake in 2015 left some analysts perplexed; although Mr. Icahn noted at the time that he felt shares were undervalued.With the dividend yield hovering around 5%, should long, income-driven investors follow Mr. Icahn’s lead?I did, in fact, assume a long position recently. My decision was, in part, influenced by certain second quarter results that I found surprising (in bold):The company’s ability to “eke out” a positive Q2 FCF result, and to forecast positive FCF through the end of the year, in light of present circumstances – circumstances that arguably should affect their “workplace-reliant” business much, much more than other organizations – struck me as a rather bullish signal. The signal becomes stronger in the context of management’s confidence to re-start share repurchases despite continued pandemic-related uncertainty.The company’s somewhat optimistic guidance is buoyed by:Thus, while all Xerox investors have been treated to a roller-coaster ride so far in 2020 (down ~31% YTD as I write this), perhaps shares have been unfairly punished.Figure 1: Xerox Share Performance Trailing 12-Months (“TTM”)Source: InveyoCertainly, as the pandemic meanders along, one expects that Xerox’s business will continue under stress; and that stress will undoubtedly contribute to increased dividend risk. However, the company’s legacy structure and operating characteristics offers a more nuanced perspective – one that may entice income investors.Despite forays into certain adjacent areas, particularly related information technology markets, Xerox remains a printing company. To that end, the business model relies upon post-sale revenues – “...which [include managed print services], equipment maintenance services, consumable supplies, and financing, among other elements [associated with printing equipment sales]”. These sales are the heart of Xerox, pumping 77% of revenues, or more than ~7B, in FY ’19. While post-sales revenues have been declining roughly (6%) per year in absolute terms, results have been fairly steady as a proportion of total sales.Figure 2: Post-Sale Revenue as a Percentage of Total RevenueData Source: Annual Report FY ‘16, Annual Report FY ‘19 Post-sale revenues are also the company’s most profitable stream and management notes, in the context of its post-sale model, that “...there [are] low annual capital expenditures (less than 2 percent of revenues) required to support our current business model.” Accordingly, the company is at a point where it has built out its operation such that “...these factors result in stable gross margins and operating margins as well as strong and stable cash flow generation.”Readers might counter that the value of this high-profit, low capital investment revenue stream is offset by the “slow death” on the top-line. It is not an unreasonable point; however, I would point out that it would take about 30 years for the post-sale business to drop below $1B in revenue per year if the average annual rate of decline of (6%) holds.But, will Xerox’s post-sale model simply wither away and die, even if it takes a long time to do so? The pandemic has cut into the business significantly in 2020, with post-sale revenue down nearly (34%) in Q2 due to the impact of office closures. But, predictably, there are arguments to support a stabilization within the business:Figure 3: Xerox Revenue by Equipment SegmentSource: Xerox Earnings Presentation Q2 FY ‘20Logically, drawing upon the preceding arguments, Xerox’s robust engine of post-sale cash flow will likely continue to provide support for shareholder returns via dividends and buybacks for quite some time.So far, the company has weathered everything the pandemic has thrown at it. Although, it would be foolish to think the situation could not get worse; and therefore, it would be foolish to think the worst is behind the company as they close out FY ’20. However, management offers investors that “...[they] have modeled numerous scenarios to ensure that [they] have flexibility no matter how the pandemic continues to impact global business.”It may be easy for many investors to dismiss Xerox, as the company has struggled to find its footing in a 21st century information technology landscape. On that point, it worth noting that the company is pushing into tangential areas that add value around its printing core, such as workflow automation and digital packaging. Further, Xerox is actively researching technologies that can serve to make the company even leaner, including sensors and AI-enabled support services, both of which can drive operating efficiencies. Therefore, even if these bets merely slow the company’s top-line decay, shareholders might nonetheless be treated to reasonable returns. This is to say Xerox can represent a profitable opportunity even if it remains in an overall state of decline. With Carl Icahn doubling-down on his bet, skittish income investors might be wise to take another look."
4377252,69945,2020-10-01T17:08:39-04:00,"XRX has committed to return at least 50% of free cash flow from continuing operations to shareholders.XRX has been paying just over 5% in dividends annually and buying back substantial stocks.With the stock price lower, XRX stock buybacks will be even more meaningful.","The mantra of the buy and hold investor is to get into companies and follow them along for the ride to the top of their industry, hopefully, securing some of the profits for yourself. That's a nice thought, but clearly, it can't be the only way to invest.Today, I want to look at Xerox Holdings (NYSE:XRX), the venerable copy-machine giant whose best years were decades ago. Looking at the company's technological development in the 1970s and 1980s, along with their dominant position in the office space, the only thing more appealing than the company they were is the company they would've been now if everything had gone right.Instead of just lamenting the road not taken, we're going to look through Xerox Holdings as it exists today and see if what's left of this company has anything to offer us at the current prices. As it turns out, it just might.In keeping with Xerox's storied past, the company sells hardware involved in scanning, printing, duplication, and general multi-function devices. In addition, Xerox offers print management software and digital printing solutions. No longer the leviathan they were in the 1980s, they remain about $9 billion in revenues and $4 billion in market capitalization.A market leader like the Xerox of yesteryear commands a mighty premium, but not being a market leader also means there is a lot more room for growth. Xerox is still well thought of by many companies and can keep growing back into a big player.And while the history is interesting, we're not buying a story, we're buying a company. In analyzing Xerox, it is most useful to examine the company from a value proposition, with an eye toward the possibility of a rebound.We've got a bargain PE ratio of about 4 on trailing earnings. The Forward PE is 15 on the basis of analyst projections for 2020 and back down to 8.3 in 2021. Breaking down the balance sheet shows sub-one Price/Book value, another desirable feature.source: most recent 10-Q from EdgarThose are some nice numbers at a $4 billion market cap. Goodwill is still a fairly large portion ($3.9 billion) of overall market cap, but unlike a lot of companies, Xerox has been doing an excellent job of turning some of that goodwill into profitability in discontinued operation.Continuing operations are the most important thing here, however, and here's why: Xerox has committed to return at least 50% of free cash flow from continuing operations to shareholders. In recent years that's meant about $213 million in dividends, and some healthy buybacks, and any hopes for this as an income stock rest on them being able to sustain that.Source: 2019 10-K from EdgarAs you can see, there was a bit of a hiccup in income from continuing operations a few years back, but the company has since recovered. Analyst estimates for revenue and earnings suggest that in the next few years, there should be more than enough continuing operations to sustain the dividend, though how much buyback can come with it is yet to be seen.That's something of a shame because the share price is a lot lower and we'd get more bang for our buck buying back, if the revenue supports it. The 2019 buyback saw 289,000 shares at $37.00, and the price is now half of that. This is a tremendous way to return value to shareholders, especially at these prices.In conclusion, the current price includes slightly over a 5% dividend yield, which is not bad, on a stock that is below its book value and has nice earnings going forward. Xerox is not some hyper-growth stock, but for a long-term holding, there is a lot to like about the steady income and equity growth possibility."
4376161,67113,2020-09-24T14:36:42-04:00,Shares remain 50%+ down from their 2020 highs.We do believe that we will get a convincing return to the office but when is anyone's guess.Xerox has a fight on its hand in the near term. It must continue to shed costs aggressively.,"Xerox (XRX) popped up from a screener we ran where the objective was to find companies with attractive valuations and which also paid out high dividend yields compared to the industry in which they operate. In saying this, Xerox has been a poor investment for many investors over the past two decades or so. The firm's share price is still nowhere near its 1999 highs and despite the dividend, many investors continue to hold a paper-loss in their portfolios.We wrote about Steelcase (SCS) recently and discussed how the ""office"" will be affected in the future. Although we see a return to the ""office"" eventually for many employees, short-term trends are definitely illustrating that remote-work will more than likely increase. Before the pandemic hit, practically all industries were in the middle of transforming their paper-based processes to the cloud and we do not see this changing any time soon. Suffice it to say, large firms will continue to advance their digital infrastructure and they will want their employees to take full advantage of this. When we see this mass-return to the office is another question entirely.As this digital transformation continues, it is taken for granted that Xerox's printer business will continue to face headwinds. However, the company will continue to avail the digital tailwinds from the other side of its business. This really is the issue for Xerox. Although management refrained from giving any type of accurate bottom-line guidance for 2020, it does believe that significant free cash flow generation will continue to be the norm for some time to come.Despite the probable 60%+ drop in earnings this year, Xerox is committed to keep on rewarding its shareholders through its dividend and buyback (roughly 50% of expected free cash flow). What is the message here? Well, if the company has the wherewithal to keep on generating cash through the rough times, this bodes well for next year and beyond. Why? Because the firm can go out and use this cash to acquire more assets (as they will be cheaper) to bring in more sales and earnings for the firm.For example, just look at how book value has been trending. Currently, the firm's book value comes in at $5.477 billion, but yet when the firm had sales of $2.2+ billion more (2017), the book value came in at $5.26 billion. This trend speaks to Xerox's much stronger financials we are seeing being played out at present.On the long-term chart of XRX, it is difficult to ascertain future direction. Shares, for example, at the end of 2019 failed to break above their 2007 highs. This means, we possibly have a long-term double top or a bullish ascending triangle in play. To ascertain which pattern has the most possibility of playing out, we go to the dividend and cash flow metrics to see how they have been trending.The optimal conditions for any dividend are when we have trends of:Over the first two quarters of this year, EBIT and margins dropped sharply which spiked the interest coverage ratio between the 4 and 6 range. Operating cash flow also took a hit due to this trend in the first two quarters. What we remain focused on is the health of Xerox's profitability metrics coming into 2020 and whether we can return to these trends over the next few quarters. Profitability was definitely on the rise coming into this year which is why analysts are predicting a robust snapback in earnings in 2021.With respect to the firm's balance sheet, Xerox has been deleveraging for quite some time now. The latest quarter saw a debt to equity ratio of 0.4 which is the best number we have seen at Xerox for quite some time.The two main risks we see with respect to Xerox's dividend are the following.Therefore, to sum up, Xerox is cheap but obviously cheap for a reason. At its present valuation (forward p/e of 7.6) and with a dividend of 5.6%, value investors are sure to be attracted. The technicals though remain unclear and there are clear risks in the near term especially if earnings remain subdued. The question now is whether Xerox can recover the bullish trends it had coming into 2020. A significant earnings beat in Q3 would go a long way in convincing the many investors who remain sceptical at present."
4376504,20599,2020-09-27T09:21:33-04:00,"Xerox Holdings is looking at a paperless future and has actively started offering its IoT and AI solutions to a wide variety of industries.Wall Street maven, Carl Icahn, has recently picked up 4 million shares at an average price of $17.Though the company is likely to face challenges in the near term, its long-term outlook holds promise.","One look at the financials and analysts' ratings of Xerox Holdings (NYSE:XRX) is enough to suggest that the company is operating in a shallow market and that it is better to track it rather than invest in it. Why then is the cult investor and XRX's 10% owner, Carl Icahn, picking up its stock like there's no tomorrow?Image Source: Guru FocusIcahn has picked up about 4 million shares between August 7, 2020, and September 9, 2020, at an average price of about $17. So what gives? Why is Icahn tanking up on XRX despite its stagnant prospects?Here's my analysis:A paperless office saves time and money, reduces wastage, helps the environment, and optimizes on office space. Moreover, documents can be archived over the cloud, and there's adequate cybersecurity available to protect them from hacking. Businesses around the world are going paperless, and this is the most obvious hit to XRX's fortunes. These days many businesses are shut because of COVID-19, so this is further driving down the demand for printers, photocopying machines, and related equipment. This translates to a cruel double whammy for XRX.The COVID-19 impact has been very severe on the company's financials. As of Q2 2020, XRX had managed to open just 50% of its facilities. The management team did not provide the 2020 guidance because there is too much uncertainty going around.Image Source: XRX's Income Statement on SAThe company's revenues have been sliding since 2015, and it has been slashing its SG&A and R&D expenses to generate a reasonable operating income. It plans to save $450 million in costs in 2020. What's interesting is that despite a disastrous Q2 2020, the company scraped through with positive operating cash flows of $34 million. It also repaid $313 debt from its cash reserves.The management team has disclosed to the SEC that the decline in office printing is a significant risk factor (p. 63) and that the paperless trend will not reverse. It also fears increasing tariffs because of protectionism in the post-COVID-19 era. XRX has developed AI- and IoT-based solutions for a variety of industries and has witnessed revenue growth in that vertical. The company also manufactures liquid metal 3D printers, which are said to have solid potential in the long term.Image Source: XRX Q2 2020 PresentationIn Q2 2020, XRX's service revenues formed 41% of its total revenues. This percentage should grow in the future. As the company is reeling from COVID-19's impact, there's little point getting into its finances or benchmarking these with prior quarters or years. The idea is to focus on prospects.Let's talk a bit about how XRX's 10% owner, Icahn, makes his money from investing.Icahn is referred to as a contrarian investor in market circles because his philosophy is to buy stocks when no one wants them. Typically, he aggressively picks up laggard stocks with poor P/E ratios, which he is convinced about. Once he has a sufficient percentage of shares, he begins calling for general meetings or asset disinvestments to maximize shareholder returns.You may also be aware that he did his best for a Xerox-Hewlett Packard (HPE) union in 2019 but failed. With Icahn around, investors can expect XRX to be in the news going forward.XRX is likely to operate in a shallow market and perhaps with several virus-related disruptions in the near term. It will also be impacted by rising global tariffs because of the protectionism we are about to witness going forward. Other near-term risks include the elections and the possibility of a U.S.-China cold war.That said, the company's prospects hold promise in the long term because of its focus on AI and IoT services, and 3D printing. The stock is currently available at $18.9, which is near its five-year low of about $14.90.But what overrides everything else is Icahn's purchase of 4 million shares in the last 40 days.*Like this article?

I highlighted them in a dozen earlier articles. I recommend retail investors consider buying shares in middling Xerox Holdings Corporation (NYSE:XRX) for four notable reasons but there are concomitant cautionary signs that make XRX a gamble. Vegas has closed anyway.Overall, Xerox appears wan and ghostly pale mixed among today's high-tech fliers.Source  Seeking AlphaThe global company designs and produces equipment; it creates and markets workplace services, communications software, management, and digitization services along with printers, digital printing presses, graphic communications, and network administration in the cloud and on-server support services. These are the core activities of the business.XRX pays an attractive 5.4% dividend yield at around a share price of $18. An investor will get +6% if XRX is dragged down by a further downturn in the stock market. Seeking Alpha recently raised its rates on aspects of the dividend: the safety of the dividend is an A-, and consistency is a C-. A dividend cut is not expected but the possibility of a dividend increase is unlikely (D-), not at least until the COVID pandemic subsides and Xerox’s cash, revenues, and earnings start to replenish.Source Simply Wall StreetAny threat to maintaining the current dividend yield is three-times sourced:Source: BusinesswireThe second reason investors want to consider XRX is the current stability of the share price. It held steady through this past summer selling between ~$16 and $19. The Quant and Wall Street ratings are Neutral per Seeking Alpha, as are others. That is a plus sign in the company column for now but the price never followed the market higher. I do not envision any factors from operations that will precipitously cause a significant share price fall. Just to note, XRX spiked 30% in Nov ’19 when a hostile takeover attempt of HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) failed.Xerox holds a debt to equity ratio touching 70% but it has been covered by operating cash flow and even reduced over the past five years. Xerox recently acquired about 25 companies (3 in 2020). The latest, Digitex Canada, was purchased in Mar ’20. Digitex provides printing, managed IT, and compliance management solutions for businesses.Another plus for investors going forward is the apparent willingness of the board and management to consider buyouts and M&A for growth. Last December, Carl Icahn (NASDAQ: IEP) was the catalyst behind the HPQ bid. He owned shares in both XRX ($3.85B market cap) and HPQ ($26.4B market cap). He tried orchestrating a sale of HPQ to XRX. HPQ itself has undergone reorganizations after poor quarterly reports.According to John Vincent, writing August 27, 2020, for Seeking Alpha, Icahn has disposed of his HPQ shares and the buyout efforts ended on a sour note. Since then, Icahn added more than ~2MK shares of XRX to his holdings reportedly in August ’20. With revenues at XRX dropping and no end in immediate sight for the pandemic, perhaps Mr. Icahn may pressure other shareholders to seek a buyer for XRX or another lofty merger? He is apparently not walking away from XRX and watching the company lumber along is not the style of this ""corporate raider.""Revenue is on a downward slope. Some look into the future projecting a leveling-off or turnaround but there are no particular reasons to assume so. There is plenty of competition in the Xerox marketplace. Xerox is in a labor-intensive industry and with H1-B visas rules tightening, Xerox and others will incur higher SG&A costs likely to negatively affect earnings.Source  OwlerXerox's growth and success have been dependent on customers having open and vibrant workplaces. Otherwise, there is scant need for most Xerox products and services. Q2 numbers enumerate what The Atlantic author, Juliette Kayyem, believes, “The coronavirus killed corporate culture. Get used to working from home.” The author’s assumption isn’t the only one. Managing Director of Fuji Xerox NZ, Peter Thomas, claims, “Twenty percent of print volumes have disappeared because of COVID and is unlikely to be recovered.”A spokesperson for Xerox told me the company does not comment on SG&A, particularly cuts like possible closures of foreign facilities, but referred me to the Xerox statement that management is engaged in a “rapid response (of SG&A cuts) to the pandemic, which enabled us to deliver positive earnings and free cash flow in the second quarter.”Xerox’s Vice Chairman and CEO summed up worrisome Q2 finances with this:Chinese and European suitors are unlikely to consider XRX with their own political and economic struggles underway. Japan’s Abenomics is keeping interest rates low, the value of the yen low, and has given impetus to an M&A spree of U.S. assets over the past three years. Perhaps the failed Fujifilm (OTCPK:FUJIF) merger/takeover talked about one year ago may be in the offing? If Mr. Icahn believes in putting shareholders first, marrying XRX and FUJIF is worth considering as a possibility.A fourth reason investors ought to positively consider XRX has to do with management's move in new directions is to revitalize revenues and increase earnings. Source James Brumley ChartI contacted Xerox for more information on which key areas of growth the company is investing in. Management's moves for future success are tied to digital innovation. It wants to become a leader making businesses efficient with automated management software. Xerox began moving in recent years to tech solutions like customized printing, digital document sharing, and 3D printing. For instance, I was referred to a piece by the Xerox Chief Tech Officer in Forbes by a Xerox investor relations spokesperson about 3D printing. Going forward, Xerox is building an additive manufacturing-focused 3D business division. Xerox is making acquisitions to speed up its initiatives, buying Vader Systems for its liquid metal technology and addressing high-speed plastics printing. Largely, this has been the focus for targeting buyouts of companies like Digitex and for bringing on new staff creating a 3D printing division within Xerox.There does not appear any factor on the horizon, looking at operations, that will spark a share price increase much beyond where the price stands today. But neither is there much of a danger of any precipitous drop in the share price from operations. The print industry is struggling, annual revenues are down, and to complicate matters, workplace shutdowns caused the financial numbers of Q2 to be hit hard. They may not improve over the next two or three quarters. Yet, the healthy dividend yield, the current share price stability and debt management, M&A or sale potential, and management moving the company into new sectors combine to justify a gamble to buy the stock. It is a player in its industry as the SA ratings suggest.This picture is courtesy Xerox. It is an image we will not see again for a long time. Notice anyone Xeroxing anything?"
4350430,101817,2020-05-27T19:45:21-04:00,Xerox stock has lost $4.5B of value in the recent selloff.Forward-looking estimates indicate that only $2.7B of value loss was warranted.XRX has poor price momentum at the moment.,"As a long standing fan of Seeking Alpha Author Ploutos, I was intrigued by his recent article that looked at the 50 worst performing stocks since the Coronavirus Stock Market lows. In particular, I looked for stocks in this list that had been hit in the short term by coronavirus but whose industry is likely to be unchanged in the long term. This list should include some deep value Coronavirus Stock Market bargains. Xerox (NYSE:XRX) jumped out as such a stock. XRX stock has been impacted by the closure of offices. My thesis is that in the long term, even if remote working becomes more prevalent, office equipment will always be needed by companies. Employees that work remotely will still need the same equipment. Dispersing the workforce may actually increase demand for office equipment.Xerox stock has lost 52% of its value since the beginning of the year. That loss of value happened almost exclusively during the Coronavirus Stock Market crash. Below, you can see how that looks in terms of market cap that was wiped out.Source: Seeking AlphaXRX lost $4.5B of market cap between Feb. 13, 2020, and the date of writing this article. Below, I analyze whether that value was justifiably wiped out, or whether Xerox stock is currently trading at bargain prices after the Coronavirus Stock Market sell-off.Xerox had an EBITDA of $1.5B in 2019. In Q1 2020, the EBITDA was $158M. Over the past 5 years, the EBITDA has consistently been around $1.5BM, averaging $1.46B. Q1 is an indication the XRX EBITDA is unlikely to fall below zero. This is confirmed by analyst EPS estimates.Source: Seeking AlphaExtrapolating the EPS estimates for 2020, EBITDA is expected to come in at around $0.5B. This translates to $1B of lost earnings this year. Looking forward to 2021 and 2022, analyst estimates are that earnings come in 20% lower than historical levels.In a bad scenario, let's assume that XRX earnings are depressed by 20% forever. On top of that, let's assume that 2020 earnings come in at $0.5B instead of $1.2B at that 20% level, i.e. a further loss of $0.7B this year. This can be translated to valuation impact by deducting 20% of the pre-COVID-19 Enterprise Value and deducting a further $0.7B. This totals $2.7B, significantly less than the $4.5B of market cap that has been lost. This would indicate that Xerox stock is indeed trading at deep value and is a Coronavirus Stock Market bargain.Perhaps, for this reason, Seeking Alpha's Quant Ratings have XRX at A+. Interesting to note that profitability is rated at A-. Momentum is at F due to recent performance, which significantly impacts its overall Quant Rating.Other Seeking Alpha authors, such as Chris Lau, have also made the case for why Xerox is trading at bargain prices.Xerox stock has been a consistent dividend payer, cutting its dividend only 3 times in the last 30 years. Each cut was during stock market crash, the most significant cut being in 2000.Source: Seeking AlphaXRX stock currently 5.8% on a forward looking basis and has a payout ratio of 66%.The analysis above indicates that Xerox stock is trading at bargain prices. The EV/EBITDA ratio is also at around 50% of where XRX has typically traded.Source: Seeking AlphaOne key question as to whether Xerox is a buy is whether this is a good entry point. The Seeking Alpha Quant Rating puts an extremely high emphasis on momentum. When I ran a screen of the highest Quant-rated stocks, the factor rating that is consistently high is the momentum rating. The EPS revisions factor rating comes in second. The logic is that even if a stock is trading at deep value, if the market doesn't recognize that, it could take a very long time to realize that value. Momentum gives an indication of whether the market recognizes that value.Xerox has an international footprint and a full lifecycle business model. In assessing the impact of COVID-19, it is necessary to understand the revenue streams.Source: Xerox 10kGeographically, two-thirds of the business is in the Americas, with one-third in EMEA (almost entirely Europe). More importantly, 77% of the revenue is from post-sale services, largely contract revenues for equipment, usage and maintenance. 36% of revenues are from non-contract sales - equipment, supplies and paper.Source: Xerox 10kIn the Q1 10Q, Xerox discusses the impact of COVID-19.In the outlook for 2020, the 10Q further details the impact.And finally,The biggest impact to revenues is on the transactional portion of equipment and supplies. This is limited to 36% of the revenue stream. In addition, it is likely that if remote work proliferates, then other Xerox equipment will be sold and deployed to enable work from home. The analyst estimates of a 20% long term revenue impact to the business represent a 56% impact to this business line. This seems extremely unlikely. Xerox itself speaks about a recovery by Q4 this year.Xerox's declaration that they intend to continue paying the dividend is putting its money where its mouth is. If Xerox did not believe in a fast recovery, it would immediately suspend its dividend.Xerox's revenue footprint, combined with its statement, indicates a fairly rapid return to business as usual. This, combined with the initial analysis that indicates an overreaction in the selloff, suggests that Xerox is a buy. It is very hard at the moment to get a read on whether the market will recognize the opportunity any time soon. For that reason, whilst I think Xerox stock is trading at very attractive valuations, I'm probably not going to buy yet. I am putting it on my watchlist, and when there are signs that the stock may start trading up, I will consider a buy. It is also definitely a stock I will consider buying if we have a second stock market crash.If you liked this article, please follow me with the follow button at the top of this page."

The company's valuation is quite low, but some longer-term risks remain. Nonetheless, Xerox may be worth a look as a recovery bet and as a speculative bet on the long-term growth potential of 3D printing.Image SourceCoronavirus has a significant impact on Xerox's business, with second quarter revenue dropping by 35.3% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share fell to 15 cents per share from 64 cents a year ago. The company lost a significant amount of service revenue - which accounts for the largest share of the company's overall revenue - as customers' deferred maintenance and lockdowns prevented accessing machines.A major risk to Xerox is that companies decide to discontinue usage of offices, and thus the Xerox products inside them - primarily printers - such as REI, who decided to sell their brand-new headquarters while keeping employees working remote. Employees working from home likely already have printers, but the revenue opportunity in servicing those printers is significantly lower than the more complicated ones in offices. It is conceivable that individuals may purchase more expensive models once remote work is decided to last more long term, but the need for physical paper copies of documents is no longer as pertinent in an online environment. This could transfer over once offices return to work, with online file sharing becoming more and more prevalent as it is undoubtedly the primary medium of communication. A longer-term revenue decline from lower printing volumes seems more than likely at the moment.The most attractive future for Xerox, in my view, lies in 3D printing. From the company's conference call:3D printing technology has the capability to be useful in manufacturing on a much wider scale than it is currently employed, especially if the costs can be brought down. If Xerox is able to capitalize on this, as they are just starting to deliver their line of printers this year, 3D printing could make up for some of the decline in traditional paper printers.Another short-term boost for Xerox could come from maintenance that wasn't performed during the worst periods of lockdown or was deferred by companies that sent employees home. Once the coronavirus is no longer as significant of a risk and offices start considering going back, having printers serviced is a likely step to be taken across the board, which could provide a meaningful quarterly boost to Xerox's earnings when it occurs.Xerox's dividend has held steady since 2017, offering a generous 5.29% yield at its current price. Xerox has indicated that they plan to maintain the current dividend rate and return 50% of free cash flow to shareholders. This includes $700 million in outstanding repurchase authority, $300 million of which is slated for the second half of 2020. At the company's current market cap of $4.03 billion, this share repurchase equates to 7.4% of the company's total value.The company's forward price to earnings is 14.68, with earnings expected to jump significantly in 2021 with a P/E of 8.42 on FY2021 EPS of $2.29. The company's selloff in early 2020 with little recovery since presents shares as historically cheap, down nearly 50% from February highs.Xerox paid back more than $300 million in debt during the second quarter but has since issued more than $1 billion in debt. The company's balance sheet with $2.27 billion in cash looks fairly safe, but its debt load remains something to look out for.Xerox's cheap valuation makes is attractive for a potential dividend or value investment. The company's stagnant dividend, though unlikely to be cut, makes it less attractive from this angle. The cheap shares provide a potential entry point for a speculative position on the company's 3D printing potential or a COVID-19 recovery play. At the same time, the risk of a prolonged period of depressed revenue, which could prove to be indefinite absent new revenue streams is likely to dampen the company's potential.Author's Note: If you enjoyed this article and found it useful, please consider hitting the orange ""Follow"" button up above to be notified when I publish new content and leave a like down below if you would like more content covering Xerox."

Xerox upped the ante early in the new year, announcing that it has secured binding financing commitments in the amount of $24 million. The dispute, with long-time shareholder activist Carl Icahn at its center, shows that: (a) the corporate world continues to adjust to the digital revolution and the rise of such consequences as the paperless office; and (b) there is money to be made, or at least risked, in the effort to outguess the corporate managers as to the directions of that transformation.On Dec. 4, 2019, Carl Icahn wrote an open letter to the shareholders of HP Inc., the successor company to the old Hewlett Packard.At this time, Icahn owned 4.24% of the outstanding common shares of HP, as well as just less than 11% of the outstanding common shares of Xerox. He took over the board of directors of Xerox last year with help from Darwin Deason.Icahn wanted the other shareholders of HP, especially, to know that he believes firmly in what he called the ""industrial logic of combining these two great American businesses.""This was a month after Xerox had first publicly confirmed that it had received an offer from HP. The board of the printing company was, and remains, opposed to the offer from the historic manufacturer of copiers, and Icahn said that he could not attribute HP ""recalcitrance"" to ""any real confidence in its standalone restructuring plan, which the market, shareholders and analysts met with extreme indifference.""HP's restructuring plan includes a new focus on 3D printing and premium PCs, a more centralized management of the marketing channel with a ""disciplined channel partner program,"" and increased hardware prices. The plan's guiding idea is that customers will be encouraged to choose between discounted printers with HP-branded supplies on the one hand or full value printers that are more flexible about their suppliers on the other.This is a move away from what is sometimes called the razor-and-blades model of pricing. HP will offer a higher-priced ""razor"" than before, because the razor will no longer have to be serviced, and in effect subsidized, by its own ""blades.""The restructuring plan also involves a reduction in staff. HP expects a reduction in its total headcount of about 8,000 by the end of the third quarter of 2022. The cuts will come about, the company says, through the automation of back-end operations and the consolidation of corporate functions.This is the restructuring in which Icahn has little confidence. He says that it reminds him of the fate of Eastman Kodak, the company that was dominant in the market for photographic film through most of the 20th century yet which struggled, beginning in the 1990s, with the advent of digital photography.Icahn is unquestionably right that Wall Street's analysts have shown little confidence in the plan. Goldman Sachs, for example, set a target price for HP stock at just $14 after it was announced. Xerox had offered a mixed cash-and-stock bid that valued each share at $22.But let us return to the Kodak analogy. Kodak, in Icahn's reading, ""wasted a great deal of valuable time by coming up with one ill-fated plan after another,"" failing to act decisively as its industry was being transformed. Kodak entered Chapter 11 in January 2012 and, although a company with the same name emerged from bankruptcy in September 2013, it was in truth a new creature.Rather than experience Kodak-style death throes, then, Icahn proposes that HP shareholders embrace the union with Xerox, which may involve $2 billion or more of cost synergies.One of the arguments HP has made is that Xerox, a much smaller company than HP, may not be able to line up the capital necessary to make good on its offer. With the announcement Jan. 6, Xerox sought to put an end to that case for recalcitrance. In a letter posted on the company's corporate website, Xerox CEO John Visentin said that the financing commitment from Citi, Mizuho, and Bank of America, comes without any due diligence conditions.HP does have another argument available. It should ask: why will a combination with Xerox help? If the movement to paperless offices is the problem, then why is a hook-up with Xerox, which like HP has a business model based on the paper in offices, a solution?Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."

The first chart was the one that surprised me the most: $10,000 invested in Xerox stock in mid-1972, even with all dividends re-invested gross of taxes and fees, would still be worth only around $10,000 48 years later in 2020. In this article, I wanted to take a look into some of the fundamental historic data of Xerox, and look for lessons on how to avoid owning one of today's blue chips that might underperform in coming decades.Data by YChartsI personally do not remember the 1970s (I was born in the late 1970s), but the little I have read about Xerox's reputation in that decade is that it was one of the dominant blue chip tech companies of that era. It was lists of the ""Nifty Fifty"" stocks to buy and hold forever, largely because of their patent on photocopier (xerography) technology at the time. I heard stories of how expensive Xerox machines were at the time, and because these machines would often break down, companies often needed to have several of them in each office. There seem to have been several court cases over Xerox's monopoly in the 1970s, which this 1978 New York Times article outlines some of.If we start the chart past the initial decline we see above in the 1972-1974 bear market, and instead start our total return chart in 1986, before the stock's ""best decade"" in the 1990s, and where many of our fundamental data series begin, we see that XRX has still underperformed a money market fund until now. Although some might say that either chart looks better than one where $10,000 declines in value to $1,000 or less, a long-term investor may say ""it's not that much that much better"".Data by YChartsThe third and final chart of total returns to investors in XRX shares is the one that highlights the importance of risk management, valuation, and timing. After a decade of steadily rising six-fold, XRX shares rapidly declined by 90% from their peak in early 1999, with most of this decline occurring in 1999 before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. XRX has traded in a range over the 20 years since, but have never really recovered or provided investors with an attractive return since.Data by YChartsBack to Peter Lynch's point about the stock being worth less because the company made less money, we see the below chart of XRX's top line revenues and bottom line earnings from 1986 to 2020. Based on my own experience of seeing Xerox less and less around me, I'm not surprised that their 2020 revenues are still around 1986 levels, but I did not know this company's bottom line so often swung between profits and losses.Data by YChartsThe volatile earnings history of XRX becomes clearer when we look at a rolling chart of its return on equity ratio (ROE, defined as earnings divided by book value of equity). We see Xerox's deepest reported loss around 2002 (the time of the Peter Lynch interview), but also two significant loss periods in the 1990s and one recently in the late 2010s. These two charts of revenue and earnings charts are no doubt much noisier due to numerous acquisitions and spin-offs, but still, even this brief visual look tells me this company does not seem to be one that produces steady, quality earnings.Data by YChartsWhat I then wanted to try and understand was what could have then driven XRX's impressive total return over the 10 years ending in January 1999, and such poor investor returns since then. The following chart shows that XRX shares paid a steady dividend in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and then started raising its dividend in the later part of the 1990s. While a steadily rising dividend is a sign of a quality company I often look for, that dividend needs to be covered by a comparably steady rise in cash earnings, which does not seem to have been the case for XRX in the 1990s. The lesson here is that it was probably a good idea to avoid the stock, even on the way up, on seeing how much more volatile Xerox's long-term earnings were compared with its dividend. Surely enough, the big loss in 2002 eventually pushed XRX to cut its dividend for most of the 2000s, and in some ways, the dividend/earnings chart looks less ""scary"" over the past decade than it did over the 1990s.Data by YChartsEarlier, I charted the XRX's ROE to show the volatility of XRX's earnings, but before moving on to valuation, feel it would also be important to run one chart on the denominator of the ROE: XRX's book value. Many may say that book value is an outdated metric, but I still find it quite useful to look at long-term trends in book value and some of the pieces that go into it (accumulated retained earnings, for example). A company's ROE (positive or negative) would by definition double if the book value gets cut in half, which could happen due to write-offs, M&A, or other reasons that may be good or bad, but worth understanding. When we chart XRX's book value per share, we don't see a nice, steady growth pattern like we might hope, but rather a far more volatile accounting history.Data by YChartsThe other reason it was important to plot XRX's historic book value per share was that the two most meaningful charts of historic valuation ratios of XRX are its historic Price/Book and Price/Sales ratios. Price/Earnings is less meaningful because of the periods when earnings were zero or negative, and the same would be true of Price/Cash Flow metrics for this stock. Even though I believe the earlier charts provided enough clues on why it may have been better to avoid this stock, the following chart hints at avoiding the biggest loss periods by not buying at the highest multiples. Since we noticed earlier that Xerox had not reported significant sales growth or book value growth in the 1990s, the six-fold rise in its stock over that decade seems to have been purely a result of multiple expansion. While investors might have significantly raised their expectations for future growth of these types of companies in the decade the internet started taking off (for example, IBM and several other companies saw similar multiple expansion that decade), it was clearly riskier to buy XRX at >4x book value than at 40% below book value.Data by YChartsThis article looked entirely at the past, but there seemed to be at least a few patterns we can probably point to, with the benefit of hindsight, as possible warning signs for avoiding another stock that returns 0% over 48 years:It could be left as a homework exercise to debate which, if any, of the top 50 blue chip stocks of 2020 might look like ""the next Xerox"" over the next 20-50 years, but to conclude here, I think it might be fair to at least extend some of these ""lessons"" to a view on XRX today:Overall though, I'm glad that this is a stock I have never bought so far, and hopefully some of these examples can remain useful memories of how to avoid similar underperformers in the future."
4352948,24960,2020-06-09T20:49:44-04:00,"Xerox has experienced declining operating performance in the first quarter of 2020.The company could settle debt payments due to its reasonable leverage level and good liquidity position.Unless it invests in high-growth 3D printing technologies, it is worth only $21 per share with the current operations.","Xerox Holdings (XRX) has underperformed the overall general market substantially. Since the beginning of the year, Xerox has declined by nearly 50%, while the S&P 500 has been down by only 1.14%. At the current price, Xerox’s dividend yield is quite juicy, at 5.7%. However, if the company does not invest in high-growth industries, including 3D printing technologies, we do not think Xerox’s dividend could be sustainable.In the first quarter of 2020, Xerox experienced declining operating performance, due to the COVID-19 global lockdown. Its revenue dropped by nearly 15%, from $2.18 billion in Q1 2019 to $1.86 billion in Q1 2020. Business closures during March have caused lower printing volumes on Xerox’s devices and delayed new installations. Around 83% of its total revenue was generated from the post-sales activities, including equipment maintenance, contracted services, supplies, and financing. In comparison, the equipment sales accounted for only 17% of its total revenue in the first quarter of 2020. The post-sale revenue seemed to hold up better than its equipment sales. Xerox experienced an 11.4% drop in the post-sale revenue, much lower than the decline of 27.5% in the equipment revenue. When the whole world is moving to paperless, we do not see much room for Xerox’s future rapid revenue growth. In our opinion, Xerox should invest heavily in 3D printing technologies, as it is one of the fastest-growing industries. The 3D printing market size is expected to grow by more than 14% in the next seven years, from $11.58 billion in 2019 to more than $33 billion in 2027. If Xerox does not renovate itself and invest in growing industries, we think its revenue would decline further in the coming years.Its net loss came in at $2 million in Q1 2020, compared to net profit of $133 million in the first quarter last year. Although Xerox incurred net losses, the operating cash flow for the quarter was $173 million, after adding back $94 million in depreciation and amortization, $80 million in non-cash provisions and the decrease of $166 million in account and finance receivables. In the first quarter of 2020, the company announced the quarterly dividend payment of $0.25 per share, which would be payable on July 31.Xerox has maintained a reasonable amount of leverage. As of March 2020, it had $2.62 billion in cash and $4.29 billion in both long and short-term debt. However, the debt maturities have spread out from 2020 to 2039, with the interest rate ranging from 2.50% to 6.78%. Xerox has to settle three big annual debt principal payments of approximately $1 billion in 2020, 2021, and 2023.Source: Xerox’s 10-K filingFrom 2014 to 2019, its revenue has been in the declining trend, from $11 billion in 2014 to only $9 billion in 2019. Xerox’s EBITDA has also decreased by more than 50%, from $2.87 billion to $1.36 billion in the same period. By 2023, if we assume a consistent 10% year-over-year decline in the company’s EBITDA, Xerox will generate roughly $892 million EBITDA by 2023. Thus, the cumulative EBITDA in the period of 2020-2023 would be approximately $4.2 billion, nearly enough to cover all of the company’s outstanding debt obligations. As a result, Xerox would have no difficulties paying its debts when they are due.Investors might like Xerox because of its consistent dividend payment. In the past ten years, it has also increased the annual dividend payment from $0.68 per share to $1 per share. However, we do not think Xerox’s dividend is sustainable.Source: YChartsIn the past decade, Xerox’s payout ratio has not been consistent, fluctuating widely from -73.8% to 800%. When the company earned little profit or generated losses, it used its cash balance to pay out dividends to shareholders. If the company does not renovate itself to invest in high-growth 3D printing technologies, we would expect Xerox’s revenue and cash flow to decline further, leading to the declining dividends in the near future. We would prefer Xerox to withhold the dividend payments and invest that cash into R&D to develop a 3D printing business to enhance its future growth.In the past decade, Xerox’s EV/EBITDA has been fluctuating widely, staying between 3.8x and 11.2x.Source: YChartsIn 2020, Xerox expected to generate nearly $940 million EBITDA. If we apply the 10-year average EBITDA multiple of roughly 7x, Xerox should have $6.58 billion in enterprise value. Assuming Xerox had the same net debt of $1.7 billion, its market capitalization comes in at around $4.88 billion. With 233 million shares outstanding, Xerox should be worth only $21 per share.If Xerox can successfully invest in 3D printing technologies, growing its EBITDA by 20% consistently, its EBITDA could reach $1.62 billion by 2023. Xerox would have much higher valuations in the market due to its double-digit growth. A 12x EBITDA multiple could place Xerox at $19.44 billion enterprise value, or $76 per share.We like Xerox because of its reasonable leverage level and low EBITDA valuation. However, we have not seen the management’s commitment to invest heavily in the fast-growing areas, including 3D printing technologies, yet. If it does that, we are pretty sure Xerox can grow its revenue and EBITDA considerably. Thus, we are looking for more growth initiatives from the company. Otherwise, we are sitting on the sidelines."

        An HP-Xerox combination makes a lot of sense.
        Plenty of room for Xerox to up its bid; or for HP to flip the script.","With both HP (HPQ) and Xerox (XRX) locked in a takeover battle, the narrative around both stocks is now firmly centered on the acquisition proposal. Xerox’s latest 33-page presentation highlights the case for a takeout, which I mostly agree with. The challenged printing and office supplies industry is ripe for consolidation, plus there is value to be created through the cost and revenue synergies of a combined HP-Xerox entity. The story is far from over; there is plenty of room for Xerox to up its bid, while HP’s balance sheet offers its management strategic optionality.Earlier this week, Xerox released a 33-page presentation outlining its proposal directly to HP investors. For context, recall that Xerox’s initial $22/sh for HP was outright rejected by the HP board in November, with concerns primarily around valuation and pro-forma leverage.The Xerox presentation offers a new spin on the offer - the major one being that the initial $22/share headline bid really equates to $31/share for HP shareholders. While the current headline offer covers $5/share in initial equity (in addition to $17/ share in cash to get to a total of $22/share), the “true” equity value of the combined company is worth an additional $9/share. The equity upside is driven by $1.7b in tax-effected cost synergies and $800m in incremental interest expense.Source: Xerox Presentation DeckThe combined entity will, post-synergies and net of additional interest expense, generate $5.0b in pro-forma net income. Based on a blended average 8.8x P/E multiple, this gets us to $44.2b in equity value, which comes to $14 in total equity value.Source: Xerox Presentation DeckThe $2b in cost synergies seem achievable - the major cost opportunity lies in accelerating cost savings in HP’s massive $58.8 billion cost base. Manufacturing and IT/R&D are the largest identified buckets, with management targeting $500-$700 million from each.Broadly speaking, the cost synergy opportunity is split into seven levers: 1) shared services centers ($100-150m); 2) manufacturing ($500-700m); 3) IT & R&D ($500-700m); 4) delivery ($280-400m); 5) supply chain and procurement ($200-300m); 6) organizational design and benefit costs ($120-150m); 7) additional SG&A ($300-400m). On top of these, Xerox is also targeting an additional $50 million from robotic process automation and predictive analytics.Source: Xerox Presentation DeckThe cost synergy cadence is back-half weighted, with $0.5bn expected to be realized in Year 1 and $1.5bn in Year 2. The $2bn is set to be dropped through to the bottom line, with incremental reinvestment “self-funded” through the program.Source: Xerox Presentation DeckWhile the cost synergy argument has been priced into the offer, I think the additional $1-$1.5b in revenue synergies makes the HP acquisition case particularly compelling. The key revenue opportunity lies in cross-selling their complementary product portfolios into each other’s installed base ($540-750m), with additional opportunities in expanding the as-a-Service offerings ($350-400m) and expanding software and services ($300-400m).Source: Xerox Presentation DeckWhile cost synergies tend to be the most impactful from a strategic perspective, the core revenue synergies should not be dismissed. After all, there is potential for business model integration at their cores - Xerox’s DNA is in enterprise copiers while HPQ’s lies in the enterprise and small & medium enterprise space. Considering the companies have plans to penetrate the other’s core market (e.g., Xerox’s growth strategy covers expansion into the SMB segment for copiers), integrating both portfolios and leveraging the respective distribution channels makes sense.That said, parts of the revenue synergy plan seem uncertain. For instance, expanding Xerox Financial Services (projected $150-300m) would entail a shift away from HPQ's commitment to HP Enterprise (HPE) as its primary financial services provider.Perhaps the most compelling case for HPQ shareholders is the prospect of a management change - Xerox under John Visentin has actively worked toward driving shareholder value, returning over 81% since the beginning of 2019 (vs. a -11% decline in HPQ).Source: Xerox Presentation DeckMuch of the year’s shareholder return is predicated on the expanded strategic relationship with HP and a reset in their Fujifilm relationship. I’d also note that Xerox management has demonstrated a stronger cost savings track record, with ~$1bn of gross savings (on a $9bn cost base) under “Project Own It” (vs. HP’s planned ~$1bn of gross savings on a ~$59bn cost base).I am not, however, entirely convinced of the combined entity’s ability to maintain an investment-grade credit rating. A deal on current terms would bring leverage up to 4.2x (though Xerox argues for ~3x with full run-rate synergies), which would bring the merged entity in line with Dell and Broadcom. The incremental interest expense of $0.8bn would imply an ~4% cost of debt on the $23.4bn in new debt required to fund the cash portion.Source: Xerox Presentation DeckThe current $1.00/share dividend should be fine though, with additional upside on offer given Xerox is targeting to return 50-75% of FCF after the initial deleveraging. However, the deleveraging period will likely result in suspended buybacks, as excess FCF is funneled into debt repayment.An HP-Xerox combination makes a lot of sense for the industry as a whole – both portfolios are complementary with limited overlap, and I believe there is a compelling case for cost savings. Based on current deal terms, I find an acquisition would be highly accretive. Assuming synergies of $2.6bn ($2bn cost synergies + $0.6bn rev synergies) drop through to median consensus EBITDA estimates, the combined company could generate over $9bn in EBITDA post-integration, which at a blended average 9x multiple, would imply over 40% accretion.Source: Author Estimates Based on Xerox Proposal and Consensus EstimatesA Xerox- HP combination would clearly be accretive, particularly in the context of the challenged office and personal printing industry. That said, Xerox’s current $22/share offer seems too low at this juncture – considering both the accretion potential and the lack of profit drivers at Xerox beyond Own It, I suspect a deal will be done, but likely at a higher price or on different terms."

The bad news is that Walgreens shares continued on a downward path, as did Xerox and HPQ stock. With Xerox now trading at half price in the year-to-date period and at a 6.9 times P/E, should value investors consider buying it?Xerox reported revenue falling from $2.5 billion last year to $2.44 billion in Q4/2019. Earnings per share rose to $1.33, up from $0.94. The company increased efficiency and found $1 billion in gross savings in the last 18 months. It forecast $450 million in gross savings this year. It highlighted investments in AI, 3D, software, and services in its FAQ. By 2021, it will save more than $3 billion.At a $4 billion market capitalization, XRX stock is barely one-quarter of the size of HP Inc., which is at $22.57 billion. Revenue will continue to stay flat in 2021, but Xerox thinks it is winning business in the SMB space. Until its ""significant product launches in 2019 and 2020"" drive higher sales, investors should expect its growth decelerating. Xerox may cut costs to align its business with the reality of harsher market conditions.Thanks to higher margins and lower SG&A costs as a percentage of revenue, adjusted operating income grew sharply in Q4.Source: XeroxInvestors did not bid shares higher despite the higher profits. Falling revenue in equipment and post sale is hardly encouraging. Revenue fell in all geographic regions on a year-over-year comparison in the Americas and the emerging markets. Color and black and white printing needs are shrinking quickly. At a macro view, the lockdown and stay-at-home policy in Xerox's major markets will only accelerate the drop in revenues.Xerox probably has little room for further gross savings. It saved $640 million in 2019, with delivery, organizational design and benefit costs, and procurement contributing the most to those cost cuts.Xerox's financing debt of $3.3 billion includes customer leases of Xerox equipment. Prior to the global slowdown, Xerox aimed for a 7:1 debt to equity leverage ratio on those finance assets. The company has enough cash on hand, with $1.8 billion in net cash (net of core debt). Pension funding of $1.2 billion is not a concern: it has 88% of net global funding.In 2020, Xerox forecast revenue falling 4%. The company may revise the decline higher in light of the unfavorable business conditions. GAAP EPS will be $2.80 - $2.90 while adjusted EPS will be $3.60 - $3.70.By not pursuing a bid on HP, Xerox will spare its balance sheet from financial strain. The acquisition would have saddled the company with $24 billion in financing commitments. Now, it may turn its focus back on its own business.

The slides that I use in this article all come from that Investor Day presentation.For reference, here is a 3-year stock chart:Data by YChartsXerox is currently trading for about $31 per share.The situation at Xerox can be summarized as follows:These 3 points are all reflected in the company's following 3-year roadmap:Management's goal is to stop the revenue decline and boost operating margins by 250 bps (2.5%) before 2022, while maintaining free cash flow above $1 billion per annum.This is essentially more of the same of what Xerox was doing before it spun off Conduent (CNDT) a few years ago - trying to manage the slow burn. The problem with Xerox is that it so far has not been able to produce organic, innovative breakthroughs that lead to stable revenues, let alone any meaningful revenue growth. Even worse, it has not even bought a company that could help it do this.For context, management is forecasting a revenue decline of 5% in 2019 after a 4.1% annual decline in 2018. Q1 2019 revenues were down 7% year over year. What happens if the 5% revenue decline is not stopped? Time for a hypothetical scenario analysis.I put together a financial model for the company that assumes the following variables:What happens after 7 years (the average length of a typical business cycle)? Under this scenario, earnings per share rise from $2.05 in 2019 to $3.33 in 2026, however, because earnings growth steadies at 5% after margin expansion stops, the valuation multiple comes down to 9. $3.33 x 9 = $28.5 so the stock price essentially goes nowhere. All shareholders would get is the dividend.Under the same model, what happens if annual revenue decline decreases to 3% in 2022 and stays at that level each year thereafter? Under this scenario, earnings per share rise to $3.51 in 2026, earnings growth steadies higher at almost 6%, and assuming the stock ultimately trades at a higher multiple of 10, the stock price rises to $33 in 2026.Finally, let us assume, under the same model, that revenue steadies in 2022 at $8.1 billion and stays constant thereafter. What happens under this scenario? Here, earnings per share would rise to $3.84, earnings growth would steady around 7.5%, and assuming the stock ultimately trades at a higher multiple of 11, the stock price would rise to $39 per share in 2026.The following table summarizes the financial model results of these 3 slightly different scenarios and how it would hypothetically affect earnings, the price multiple, and the stock price in 7 years:What is interesting in this scenario analysis is the interplay between valuation and share repurchases. The lower the price multiple, the more shares the company can buy back and the faster the earnings growth. There is a constant give and take between valuation and earnings growth. Ultimately, the right match is for the company to return to quality long-term revenue growth while only repurchasing shares when the stock is structurally undervalued.Management says the shares are a good investment now, so it is repurchasing shares aggressively. I disagree. They are only a good investment now at the current price multiple (~15 or so) if the strategy ultimately succeeds and this is no easy task. If the strategy does not succeed and the 5% annual revenue decline continues (the first scenario that I outlined above), then returns on invested capital would continue to deteriorate and this destroys shareholder value. Furthermore, if the company cannot stop the revenue decline, then operating income will ultimately fall and financial leverage will increase.Physical printing and related services are certainly on the decline; however, they are not going away completely and there may be some growth pockets in emerging markets. If Xerox's new management team can simply stop the revenue decline, potentially by filling the gap with new business opportunities, then we have a company that can be reborn.Please note that I assumed that management is only able to increase margins by 150 bps and not the 250 bps promised in its strategic outlook. The history of margin expansion attempts at Xerox is littered with dead bodies, so I think it is wise to account for some casualties here.Xerox's failure over the years has been its inability to offset print decline with a replacement digital product. I once read Xerox was working on a computer screen that you could roll up like a piece of paper. Why not some sort of digital notebook with physical digital pages for those of us who sometimes prefer to print out a few very important pages? For example, in preparation for this article, I printed out 3 pages from Xerox's 2018 Annual Report. I would not mind having a digital notebook at my desk where I could have these 3 pages separate for me from my desktop screen to markup (and then later erase when I am done with the project).One aspect of Xerox's new strategy for growth is to switch to a holding company structure that buys independent businesses to incubate them - sort of like a venture capital fund. The problem I see with this strategy is that the financial model does not allow for enough acquisition CAPEX to eventually translate this into significant revenue growth.Xerox is a workplace brand and the company has been missing out on leveraging its brand to make work better. Companies like Dropbox (DBX) are simply crushing it in this regard.The following slide highlighting Xerox's innovation programs reveals that the company is mostly sticking with the ""printing"" strategy for which its brand is still known.As much as shareholders would like to see Xerox become the next Apple (AAPL), this print-focused strategy makes more sense and I see a potential success here, like digital packaging, as far more achievable. One success here could mean a great deal to the bottom line. For example, capturing a 10% share of the digital packaging and print market over a 5-year stretch would be enough to get the whole business growing by 2% annually, assuming through all the other measures that the company can stop the revenue decline. 2% revenue growth does not seem like much; however, coupled with another 100 bps increase in operating margins (to 8%) and the aggressive share repurchase plan, this stock would be at $60 in the 7th year of my scenario analysis, helped by a higher valuation multiple (e.g., 15). In other words, this would give the company the fundamental earnings growth power to double its share price every business cycle.From a risk/reward standpoint, it seems advisable to prepare for the failure scenario while retaining the optionality for outsized returns if management can successfully turn the ship around.Recalling that the lower the share price the more shares can be repurchased, there is a price threshold here that makes sense for investors as an entry point where they will be less likely to get burned. Keeping this in mind, take a look at the following long-term weekly logarithmic chart:Chart courtesy of barchart.comYou can glean from the lower channel I have drawn in this chart that there is a certain price threshold where the stock will quickly snap back aided by share repurchases.For me, the optimal entry point here would be $25 per share which is near the bottom of this channel. This is also only 10.3 times my 2020 earnings estimate and 9.3 times my 2021 earnings estimate which, again, assumes that operating margins only increase by 100 bps during this time frame. Buying at or below $25 reduces downside risk while giving the investor time to observe the quality of the turnaround strategy. This would imply buying at a low multiple so a successful turnaround would benefit the investor two-fold through stronger earnings growth and multiple expansion. This is a strategy that I am now considering."

Xerox has a high beta, but the upside makes it a strong buy.Source: Xerox.comXerox has a history of revenue decline. From 2016 to 2018, the annual revenue decline improved from 6.1% to 4.2 % per year. The market for copiers and printers has been declining in revenue, as did the real price per page. Xerox has not been able to offset this. Xerox had superior products but it could not get a sufficient price premium.This year Xerox introduced new high end and mid-market products. They developed a partnership with Hewlett-Packard to supply entry-level machines to Xerox and Xerox will make toner for Hewlett Packard. The partnership with American Express better served the small business market. They are going after large customers promoting their higher security and document management systems. They have expanded their metallic color ink to the middle market and introduced a superior high-end color machine. With all of this, analysts had expected improved sales but they deteriorated 9% in the first half. Xerox projects a full year decline of 6% in constant currency, which is about 7.5% with typical exchange rates weakness against the dollar. The revenue decline in the second half would have to be reduced three percentage points to meet Xerox full year guidance.The plan for Xerox growth was to achieve a 3% decline in 2020 followed by flat revenue in 2021 on a constant currency basis. Markets of eight and a half by eleven-inch multifunction printers are declining six percent a year. High-end black and white is declining at twelve percent a year. Growth niches are limited. High-end color and legal size printers are only growing at two percent. Managed e services is growing at three percent. Software and digital services are adjacent markets growing at around six percent. Xerox is trying to penetrate these markets.Xerox innovation efforts are aimed at using their print and software technologies in non-traditional markets. These markets are:The innovation products will not appear in significant quantities for about two years. Not all these efforts will succeed.Management is not good at projecting rate of sales decline. It is likely that all of the changes were too much for the sales force to absorb. Sales in the last month of the second quarter in major accounts improved and that improvement is continuing in the third quarter. Management has said that they were planning investments to increase growth costing 32 cents per share, which will be increased to 40 cents a share. This will be spent on selling and sales support particularly for large account sales. These expenditures will not produce rapid results, but they do not need to.If Xerox continues to miss its target for slower sales decline, it still has a viable long-term future. However, if it gets back on track for projected sales, they should bounce back to the mid-thirties price. The probability of achieving that it is a case of a limited risk. The stock will not fall if there is no improvement in sales. If the sales improve, there is a substantial upside.The new product innovation outside the traditional market could produce strong niches like packaging printing. However, it will probably produce profitable businesses in high growth niches, which would make Xerox an attractive long-term investment. Xerox has the advantage of strong inherent cash flow as most leasing businesses do. So, this strategy is by no means as risky as it appears because it has the high cash flow. Xerox grew its earnings per share by 24% in the second quarter. A big piece of that growth is share buybacks made possible by the large cash cushion. Falling sales and surging EPS is a strange combination that has made investors very nervous. However, it contains the possibility of excellent long-term returns and not just a pop as the sales returned to their projected level.Xerox built up massive staff to support a business several times its current size. Complex internal management and IT systems were cut as the business declined but by never enough. Therefore, I believe that the current cutbacks will still leave a strong business. Xerox is a strong buy."
4308086,69675,2019-11-20T14:16:08-05:00,"The management team at Xerox continues to see big changes completed at the firm.These are aimed at creating significant long-term value by selling off non-core assets and seeking a merger with HP Inc.HP threw a snag into the picture with its rejection, but negotiations are likely to resume.","It's an interesting time for technology firm Xerox (XRX). After rebuffing HP Inc. (HPQ) and its advances to acquire the firm, Xerox's management team not only put out their own offer to acquire HP, they continued on the road to restructuring their business in order to create long-term shareholder value. These latest moves deserve particular attention, as does the prospect still of a deal between it and HP coming through. Through these types of transactions, significant shareholder value can still be made which, for the struggling Xerox, is desperately needed.Excluding M&A rumblings, there are two big developments surrounding Xerox recently that warrant attention. The first of these is updated guidance provided by management. In its third quarter earnings release, the management team at the firm said that this current year is looking better than previously anticipated. The actual new guidance, stacked up against the prior guidance, can be seen in the table below.*Created by AuthorIf all goes according to plan, earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share should both be marginally higher this year than what management expected in the recent past. At the mid-point, earnings now should be about $3.15 per share, or about $0.175 per share higher than management thought before. Adjusted earnings of $4.05 per share at the mid-point imply the same increase. Earlier this year, the company expected operating cash flow to be around $1.20 billion, but that figure has now been pushed higher to $1.25 billion, while free cash flow forecasts have been revised higher to the tune of $0.10 billion to $1.15 billion.This guidance does not take into consideration the company's latest divestiture, which is the second point that needs addressing. Earlier this month, management announced the sale of its 25% interest in Fuji Xerox Co., plus the sale of its 51% stake in Xerox International Partners, an OEM joint venture between them and FUJIFILM Holdings Corporation (OTCPK:FUJIF). In addition to receiving net proceeds of $2.3 billion from the transaction, the company is having FUJIFILM Holdings drop its $1 billion lawsuit against it that related to the two entities' failed merger from 2018. Supply chain assurances, plus a royalty on sales to existing Xerox International Partners, have also been included as part of this transaction.For years, Xerox has failed to be a beacon of success. To see this, we need to only look at the graph below. Between 2014 and 2018, the company's revenue dropped from $12.68 billion to $9.83 billion. This year, sales should be lower still by around 6%. All of this excludes the impact of its recent asset sale. While net income has improved from its low in 2016, it's still down a great deal from 2014, and operating cash flow has been mostly level for the past four years. This year (for the first three quarters), revenue is down 8.2%, but operating cash flow has done better. So far, it stands at $895 million, up 23.4% over the $725 million seen a year earlier. Besides this recent recovery on its bottom line, the only redeeming quality pertaining to the firm's performance in recent years was the fact that debt has fallen from $7.74 billion in 2014 to $4.83 billion. With its recent asset sale, management indicated that it wanted to pay off its $554 million in notes due in December of this year.*Created by AuthorGradually improving cash flows is great, as is lowering leverage, but in order to truly transform the enterprise, management has made the decision to try buying up rival HP. For several days, rumors had circulated over what the terms entailed, but in a press release made public by HP on November 17th, we finally got a confirmed look at what Xerox had in mind. According to the letter sent to HP's Board of Directors, Xerox offered to acquire its larger peer in a transaction valued at $22 per share. $17 per share of this would be in the form of cash, with the rest being payable in the form of 0.137 shares of Xerox stock for each share of HP stock outstanding.In all, this move valued HP at $33.5 billion. This is inclusive of net debt outstanding. The actual equity value of the transaction stands at $32.60 billion according to my math. Of this, $25.19 billion would be in the form of cash. As of their most recent quarterly filings, Xerox and HP had cash and cash equivalents on hand, respectively, of $922 million and $4.92 billion. Assuming that Xerox is able to use all of HP's cash on hand for the deal, plus the $2.3 billion (less the $554 million used toward the debt reduction) the firm got from its sale, it will still be about $18.53 billion short to transact the deal. If nothing else changes, this is a great deal of debt to take on.One big benefit from this transaction for both parties is the proposed synergies that would be generated. Xerox pointed out $2 billion in annual run-rate synergies that could be generated over the first 24 months following the completion of the transaction. $0.5 billion of this would come from combined supply chain and distribution cost-cutting. The remaining $1.5 billion would come from combining their R&D functions and from streamlining corporate functions. Though this sounds like an excellent move for the synergies alone, HP's management team said, in its rejection letter, that any sort of deal would require extensive due diligence (in part, probably, to ensure that synergies are realistic), plus HP's management said that the proposed transaction significantly undervalues its own business.The first point is fair, but so too is the second point. Already, we have seen the relatively poor performance demonstrated by Xerox in recent years. HP is no all-star itself, but its results have been demonstrably better. To see this, we need to only look at the graph below. In it, you can see a continued, painful decline in the firm from 2014 through 2016, but 2016 appears to have been its trough year. Since then, the company's revenue has risen nicely, its net income has more than doubled, and its operating cash flow has risen nicely too. To see its fortunes dictated by a smaller firm and to see that smaller firm walk away with 52% of the stock in the combined entity is disconcerting.*Created by AuthorBased on the data provided, it's clear that Xerox is working hard to restructure itself and to redefine itself. This is excellent, and the moves made so far look to be value-accretive. Having said that, it's hard to see the company being able to complete such a large deal given their size disparities. If the deal does get done on terms even remotely close to this, though, Xerox and its shareholders should benefit tremendously, but given it's hard seeing this happening unless the company can sweeten the deal. At this time, Xerox badly seems to need this deal, but HP doesn't and it has that as its advantage. I do expect further negotiations to take place, but the end result, while helping Xerox, should be best for HP overall."

These red flags scare off investors, but the fundamentals make it a strong buy.Xerox Stock PriceSource: Finbox.io Xerox is a tale of two markets. The present one is shrinking. The second market is a series of high growth sectors. This creates an exceptional investment.In the copier market, Xerox is No. 1 in the A3 (8.5by 11 inches) and No. 1 in the high volume black and white market. The A3 market is shrinking by 6% per year and the high end B&W is shrinking by 12%. It is No. 1 in high volume color and managed services but this is not enough to stop the 5% a year slide. Xerox has a plan to promote the A4 market, but these markets are growing at 2% a year. Flat revenue requires market share gains, which are difficult to get in a shrinking market.The following table illustrates these trends.While the A3 market is shrinking by 6%, the profits in the market are razor thin if any. The product is needed for distributors in key markets. One reason Xerox profitability has held up so well, despite shrinking volume, is that most of the decline is in the marginal profit A3 market. The high volume black and white market is very profitable but small. The high volume color market is six times larger.With the market shrinking at 8% per year, a 5% revenue decline means Xerox is gaining share. It plans to use its success in managed services and software, which provides document security to further improve share. It also plans to expand its A4 product lines and expand distribution into the small and medium sized businesses. There is nothing new to this approach. It will be difficult to get flat revenue by 2021, but it is achievable. Moody’s downgraded Xerox debt because of the continual decline in sales.Xerox targets plans for the adjacent new markets are challenging. None of these products will be in the market until 2020. The following table illustrates the value of the adjacent markets it is targeting.Digital Packaging is the printing directly on the package itself rather than sticking a label on it. For example, printing on a milk bottle without a label. To do this the inks must be a lower cost than what is used today so the challenge is material development.Artificial Intelligence would be a custom interface on an existing AI system. The prototype application would involve analyzing RFPs (Requests for Proposal) to determine what is needed for a response.Xerox already makes nozzles for 3D printers. However, this concept calls for much lower costs so that it can be used for volume manufacturing.Sensors involve printing electronic circuits used by the internet of things.These developments involve work done in PARC, which developed the graphical interfaces used by Apple’s Macs and Windows, and the Wilson center, which developed the ink jet. These groups are a shadow of what they once were, but they still have strong capabilities in uncrowded niches.Xerox will not succeed in all activities. In some, a partial success is all that may be achieved. Still one hit could transform the business. Success will be difficult to determine in 2020 but it has a strong potential.Xerox has the infrastructure of the much larger company it once was. The company is undertaking a radical reduction in the business. For example, information technology is projected to go from 4% of revenue to 1%. Processes will be simplified and levels of management reduced. In 2019, savings of $640 million are projected on a gross full year basis. This is a smaller version of Proctor and Gamble’s $10 billion cost reduction that cut employment by 30,000. For this to be achievable, previous CEOs would have to be weak. They were. They drastically cut manufacturing but kept internal practices that were unsuitable for the present smaller business.With a partial year of savings, the quality of earnings is strong. In 2018, adjusted net income was $893 million. However, the reported income was a half billion less. The 2019 guidance increases adjusted net income by 1% but reported net income is up 76%. The cost of the failed Fuji deal, IT contract termination, Fuji restructuring and higher estimated taxes totaled $300 million in 2018, but zero in 2019.Thus the reported 2018 earnings per share of $1.38 yield a P/E of 22. The 2019 guidance of $2.60 cents yields a P/E of 12.Xerox is struggling with a declining market, so it projects a 5% decline in revenue for 2019. However, an extensive restructuring is expected to yield gross annual savings of $640 million in 2019. Reported Net Earnings are expected to be up 76%. Despite the decline, Xerox projects flat revenue in 2021. They have aggressive new product programs in adjacent markets. Xerox is a strong buy."

Even though the company's sales continue to struggle, I believe the stock has entered ""Buy"" territory based on the following:Xerox's revenue has fallen by 3% during 2018, which has been a consistent trend over the past couple of years. The good news is the company has been able to combat this by cutting costs and eliminating underperforming business units, which has resulted in operating margin improvement since 2016. This is an important trend to watch and is a strong indication the company's worst times are behind it.As you can see by the table below, Xerox has made big strides over the past 5 years to improve its balance sheet. Net cash balance has improved by $2.2 billion, and the current ratio is close to 2x. This is another strong indicator that the company is on the right track despite its revenue performance.Xerox has had a rocky dividend history, which goes all the way back to 1971. The dividend was removed in 2002 (then reinstated in 2007) and has been cut multiple times. With that being said, the dividend is currently in good shape. A yield of 5.09% and a low payout ratio of only 31% this year is compelling (the payout ratio has averaged 37% since the beginning of 2015). Xerox basically needs to produce $300 million worth of free cash annually to support its dividend, which I don't think the company should have a hard time doing for the foreseeable future.Given my analysis below, Xerox is attractively valued relative to peers based on Forward P/E and EV/FCF. Keep in mind that the company's long-term growth is likely negative based on historical trends, at least for the next couple of years (I couldn't find any reliable source that listed its growth rate). In my opinion, the discount relative to peers is enough to offset these growth concerns.Xerox also looks undervalued according to this discounted cash flow model, which has a number of conservative assumptions. First, I've used a beta of 1.5x, which considerably increases the required annual rate of return. Second, I've assumed almost no long-term growth. Last, I've assumed Xerox produces $650 million in free cash flow during 2019 (consider that the company has already produced this amount through 9 months of 2018).Xerox isn't the most widely covered stock, so I'd take these comments with a grain of salt. According to MarketWatch, there are no negative ratings on the stock, with all analysts maintaining at least a Hold rating. The average target price is $32.88 per share, which represents 66% upside potential based on the current price of $19.75.Xerox stock hasn't traded this cheap since the beginning of 2013. The company has certainly had its struggles since then, but difficult times have forced it to cut costs and discard underperforming units. This should help the company navigate what's likely to continue being a difficult market for the next few years. With that being said, a Forward P/E of 5.5x and EV/FCF Ratio of 11.6x significantly undervalue the stock and provide a good opportunity to begin opening up a small position. This opinion is supported by my discounted cash flow model (22% upside projected) and Wall Street's opinion (66% upside expected)."

The risks of corporate espionage/leaks might lead to many American companies leaving Xerox's MPS platform.Hewlett-Packard has more than $6.7 billion in cash and short-term investments. It can also raise bank debt to fund its bid for Xerox. I opine that HP, Inc. doesn't need to borrow more than $4 billion to buy a controlling stake in Xerox Corporation.

Yes, Hewlett-Packard gained 6,500 printing-related patents when it bought Samsung's (OTC:SSNLF) printing division for $1.05 billion.On the other hand, adding more patents and taking ownership of the legendary Xerox brand can help Hewlett-Packard extend its lead over its fierce printing rivals Canon Group (CAJ) and Epson (OTCPK:SEKEY).

Buying Xerox, therefore, complements HP's biggest regional source of income.(Source: Xerox Corporation)Furthermore, the long-term contribution of Xerox comes from its large MDS (Managed Document Services) venture. Subscription fees from MDS accounts for 33% of Xerox's quarterly revenue. Managed Document Services is also known as Managed Print Services [MPS]. MPS is the term that printer/copier firms gave their subscription-only service to supply companies with printers, scanners, copiers and the secured software ecosystem for digital and hardcopy document creation and management.As per the persistent survey tracking of HG Data, Xerox has more customers for its MPS products. HP, Inc. only has 8,529 companies using its MPS products. Xerox Corporation touts 32,489 companies paying for its Managed Document/Print Services. For eight consecutive years, Xerox has remained the world's leader in MPS.GrandView Research predicted that the global Managed Print Services can reach annual revenue of $49.7 billion by the year 2025. Hewlett-Packard can become the undisputed leader in global MPS by purchasing Xerox. Combining Xerox and HP's platforms can feasibly result in $1.5 billion quarterly revenue from managed document/print solutions.Gartner's old 2015 Magic Quadrant circle for MPS identified Xerox and HP as the two visionary leaders. HP taking over Xerox will produce a championship tag team in Managed Print Services.(Source: Gartner)Yes, a Hewlett-Packard + Xerox combo makes great business sense. Going forward, HP acquiring Xerox is going to be a bigger tailwind than the successful acquisition of Samsung's printer/copier subsidiary. Xerox Corporation's $10.26 billion annual sales is a desirable addition to HP's $52.06 billion annual revenue. However, this article is subjective. I do not have any proof that HP will actually bid for Xerox. I can only conclude that letting Fujifilm buy Xerox will create a long-term headwind for Hewlett-Packard.Letting Fujifilm take over Xerox's robust North American operations can be detrimental to HP's $5.1 billion/quarter printing business. Fujifilm will take control of the world's leader in Managed Print Services. Fuji Xerox (75% owned by Fujifilm, 25% owned by Xerox) is already big in the Asia-Pacific Region.HP bought Samsung's printer/copier business precisely because it wants to diminish Fuji Xerox's growing clout in Asia/China. HP, therefore, will only be handicapping itself if it allows Fujifilm to acquire control of Xerox Corporation's rich client list of corporate and government customers in North America.HP, Inc. is still a bargain long-term investment even if it does not buy or merge with Xerox. HPQ has a very low Forward P/E of 10.20x. HPQ is also currently valued at only 0.65x Price/Sales. HP's profitable leadership in printing and hardcopy peripherals will remain intact even without Xerox Corporation.XRX also has a very low 0.70 Price/Sales valuation and its forward P/E ratio is 7.63x. XRX, therefore, is also a legit value play. Xerox's global leadership in Managed Print Services will help it survive.Editor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

4229803,67113,2018-12-22T14:52:36-05:00,Stock is attracting attention because of its low book value.Dividend looks strong.Value play or value trap?,"Xerox Corporation (XRX) has all the hallmarks of an attractive value play at present. The company is trading below its book value and has a forward earnings multiple of only 5.8. Furthermore, the firm's cash flow multiple is 6.0 and its sales multiple is 0.5. The firm pays out a 5.1% dividend yield which equates to $1 per share when taken over a 12-month period. Furthermore, and most critically, Xerox's current operating profits come in at $883 million over a trailing 12-month average.All of the valuation metrics above (with the exception of cash flow) are well behind what the industry in general is trading at. The dividend is more than double what the industry is trading at which again is attractive from a value perspective. The debt to equity ratio is 0.93.However, there is so much more to value investing than cheap earnings or a low book multiple. This stock is cheap for a reason. Our job is to find out if it can recover or not. We like to monitor the trends in other ratios also such as the current ratio and the return on capital metric. The balance sheet is always critical and more research is required there also despite the attractiveness of the stated debt to equity ratio of 0.93. Is the dividend safe? If not, this would present another concern for driving the price lower. Let's dig in.When researching stocks which have been totally beaten down, liquidity is the probably the most important metric one should look at. No matter how good a company's fundamentals are or how attractive its valuation is, if a firm can't access capital when it needs it, this usually spells danger. This why the current ratio is so important. At present, it comes in at 1.82 which along with last year (1.91) are the highest numbers we have seen since 2009. We usually look for a current ratio over 2. However, they are pretty close and trending in the right direction. Current assets have been remaining steady around the $5 billion mark, but current liabilities are now down to close to $2.7 billion. This gives healthy working capital of over $2.2 billion as its shows strength from a liquidity point of view.If we move onto the long-term financials of the company, we have already stated that the firm's net debt to equity ratio comes in at 0.93. What we invariably look here to see is how accurate this number is, how inventories are trending and the value of the goodwill. In our opinion, inventories are remaining stubbornly high at $958 million. This number is on a par with 2016 inventory numbers when the company was turning over almost $2 billion more. Goodwill in the latest quarter came in at $3.9 billion. This number looks high when one compares this number to the amount of assets Xerox has on its balance sheet. In fact, it makes up 25% of the assets of the company. Remember this line item represents unlocked potential value.Over the past four quarters, the company has paid out $272 million out of a free cash flow kitty of $778 million. This gives us a cash flow ratio of 35% which is attractive. The annualized payout is $1, and as the firm's interest coverage ratio presently comes in at 7.01, we don't see any present risk to the dividend.In summary, Xerox has all the hallmarks of a potential value play. Its strong dividend, low valuation and strong liquidity will definitely attract potential value players. The potential concern would be as follows. Although the balance sheet may have plenty of equity at present, we feel the firm will have to spend heavily in the years to come. Whether this is through acquisitions or R&D, Xerox's print business is likely to remain under pressure. This is the problem with investing in a company where its core industry is in decline. Managed print services will help, but re-invention and transformation must take place. What is encouraging is how earnings estimated have been rising for both this year and next. We may get long here once equity markers bottom in unison."

This will present the strategies and products to expand their niche.Before the downgrade, Xerox was undervalued. Now, it is drastically so. The company expects a positive cash flow of $900 million to a billion, so it has no liquidity problems. It is a strong buy.","Source: Finbox.ioXerox (XRX) declined sharply with the downgrade of the debt from Moody's, dropping from $25 to $19. Xerox was undervalued at $25. It is even more undervalued now. Xerox is one of a flock of ""fallen angels"" - companies that were investment grade but were downgraded to junk. Xerox operating income increased 33% and it has the technical and financial resources to expand its niche and grow revenue. It is a strong buy.By the key investment ratios, Xerox is attractive to a value investor. These are summarized in the following table. The P/E is half that of the depressed industry. It is 6.5 vs. 12.9 for the industry. The Standard and Poor's 500 ratio is 20.The price to book value is 1.2 to the industries 2.2. This ratio is less favorable because goodwill is $3.9 billion compared to total equity of $5.3 billion. The price is 0.5 of sales compared to the industry's average of 0.7.Xerox's dividend is $1.0 per share or 5.3% of the share price. This is also unusually high.Moody's has downgraded the debt because of the decline in the market for copiers and printers and intense global competition. The following table demonstrates that the revenue is continuing to decline at three percent per year. Moody's is correct about the continuing decline in imaging. However, cost reductions of 5% of revenue lead to a 33% increase in operating income. Purchases from Fuji Xerox represent 70% of the cost of sales. Management expects that competition to find the lowest cost suppliers and greater commonality will reduce the cost of sales. They are also simplifying the complex computer systems and procedures left over from the time when Xerox was a larger company.The benefits of the higher operating income were more than offset by a prior year tax charge, so the net income declined.A lower credit rating means that Xerox will eventually pay higher interest on its debt. Notes due in 2021 now sell with a yield increase of 56 basis points on a billion dollars of debt. That is $5.6 million before the tax deduction. Xerox has $5.3 billion of debt.Bloomberg analysts published a report identifying secular declines and execution challenges at Xerox two months before the downgrade. These issues are real. The imaging market has continually declined. The fact that cost reductions exceeded the decline in 2018 does not mean they will do so in the future. Thus, Xerox cannot get back to investment grade by paying down debt. They must stop the decline in revenue.Carl Icahn, who controls Xerox, agrees. The new management has pledged to present a plan to revive the business on February 5. Management's four objectives are:Management is succeeding in optimizing revenue, but not in driving revenue enough to maintain flat copier and printing revenue.Management will present its plans to expand the market niche. The success of these plans is not certain but there are reasons for optimism. Xerox spends more than $400 million per year on research and development. They originated the ink jet and sell print heads for 3D printers to manufacture parts. The concepts include selling software separate from printers, printing directly on plastic containers, printing electronic circuit boards etc. Copiers and printers are commodities but high-speed printers for print shop application are differentiated products.Xerox has $1.2 billion of cash. They have good cash flow, so they have the financial resources as well as the technical strength to expand their niche.Carl Icahn likes his cash, so it is likely that the dividend will not be cut. His reputation is to run the company for short-term gains and dump it. In this case, the profitable move is to get revenue growth, which requires expanding the niche. He has contempt for the last two Xerox CEOs whom he believes grossly mismanaged the business. This leads him to believe that he can get the business growing again. Icahn fought a $40 per share offer for Xerox. He anticipates that the business can be made to be worth more than $40."
4207871,104395,2018-09-24T09:38:49-04:00,"Xerox stock has risen 20% in the current quarter, three times the S& P 500 performance.Major changes are being made to reduce the cost of sales and operating expense.The new CEO expects to develop product to expand the current market niche making Xerox a buy.","With a new CEO, Xerox (XRX) stopped providing a projection of revenue and income for this year. Despite that, the stock has gone up 20% since July began, three times faster than the S&P 500. Xerox is out from under the failed takeover by Fuji Xerox (OTCPK:FUJIY)-(OTCMKTS). It is becoming a normal business with strong cash flow. In late fourth quarter (2018) or early first quarter (2019), it will present the plans and objectives for the business. The plans need to show new products that will increase revenue along with better product sourcing. Operational changes will increase efficiency and lower cost. After two years of flat operating income, this appears achievable therefore making Xerox a buy.Source: Finbox.ioPhoto: XeroxThe increase in stock price is not because of financial performance. The second quarter was mediocre.Xerox faced a risk of a $183 million (64 cents per share) breakup fee for walking away from the sale of Xerox to Fuji. Fuji dropped the suit and retired the head of Fuji Xerox. The former CEO of Xerox left without the $18 million severance payment in his contract. At the Citicorp investor’s conference on September 6, 2018, the new CEO John Visentin said that relationship with Fuji is very good. The new CEO will not provide financial guidance until an investors’ day in the late fourth quarter (2018) or early first quarter (2019) except to say that free cash flow is projected at $750 to $950 million. Xerox is working on a detailed review of the company and its areas for growth.The new management is pushing hard with the following initiatives.Supply Chain: Xerox is looking at how to buy products and services and get the finished product to the customer quickly and simply, at lower costs. The elephant in the room is that 59% of the product cost is from Fuji. Xerox will no longer automatically buy from Fuji. They will competitively source for the lowest cost. As Xerox develops new products, they are buying competitively. The new President of Fuji has said to his staff that they must prove themselves every day. Obviously, the percentage of product cost from Fuji will decline as will total product cost.Simplify the costs of operation: Xerox has the legacy of a larger company with information technology systems too complex for the present business. Its practices and procedures are too complex. The company has launched the ""You own it"" initiative to assign clear responsibility for activities to simplify and speed up the process. John Visentin emphasizes that this is not a cost reduction action as was done in the past. He encourages middle management to devise a more efficient process, the fall out of which will be lower costs and staff reductions.John Visentin talks of the potential for new products from the activities at Park in Palo Alto research in California and the Webster NY lab to reignite growth in such areas as software printing on packaging and other opportunities. However, he recognizes the need to start from the existing products.Xerox‘s market is shrinking three percent per year, with annual equipment price declines of five percent. This table illustrates the effect of the launch of 29 new products in late 2017. These are in the mid-market and entry range. Xerox did not achieve revenue growth but it did gain share in a declining market. The equipment sales are the revenue driver. The post sales are service and supplies such as toner and paper.The objective needs to be product that will result in revenue growth.Photo: XeroxRevenue dropped sharply in 2016 with the split up. The response in 2016 to 2017 was to cut employment by seven percent per year and eliminate facilities. Therefore, despite falling revenue, the operating income in the last two years has been flat.The table below summarizes the last three years of Xerox’s income without the 2018 management projection. Adjusted operating income eliminates restructuring costs and non-service pension costs, which appear every year. This table does not include these adjustments. Operating Income is per GAAP.The current stock price of $28.60 per share is 15 times 2017 earnings.The processes improvement should increase future profitability substantially and increase the price earnings ratio to over 20. This makes Xerox a strong buy."
4178460,104395,2018-05-31T11:49:06-04:00,"Xerox (XRX) is an attractive stand-alone business. Operating income has been stable for the last two years. With new products and the effects of restructuring, EPS should grow 25%.Carl Icahn is looking to improve the company’s performance with a new CEO and sell the company at a higher price.A restructured deal with Fuji Xerox would be valuable to both parties and it is still possible to capture benefits of combination that exceed the profits of both companies.","Can a company that fired its CEO and six Board members, with shrinking revenues, erratic profitability, impenetrable financial statements, controlled by a corporate raider, be a good investment? If you understand what is going on, you can profit from situations that scare off most investors. As Warren Buffett said this is a “time to be greedy when others are cautious”.Carl Icahn worked his way through Princeton by playing cards with his wealthier classmates. He amassed a fortune shaking up corporate America, but hit a dry spell in the last three years, when his net worth dropped to $18.2 billion. Splitting up Xerox into its original business and a backroom processing operation was a success, earning Icahn $100 million. He has $700 million of stock, which he would be happy to sell for a billion. He might even take less, if the prospects were poor.Icahn is contemptuous of combining with Fuji Xerox with its questionable accounting that could overvalue it, making Xerox shares worth less than the CEO advertised. He removed the CEO and board members, killing the Fuji acquisition that was worth north of $40 per share. Xerox faces a risk of a $183 million (64 cents per share) breakup fee for walking away. Fuji is threatening to sue, but Icahn has already sued Fuji charging accounting irregularities and that the income offered to the board members and the CEO contingent on the deals success is a bribe to violate their fiduciary responsibility. Icahn’s posturing is overdone, but there is enough truth in it to make it unlikely that the breakup fee would hold up in court.Xerox‘s market is shrinking three percent per year, with annual equipment price declines of five percent. Revenue dropped sharply in 2016 with the split up. The response in 2016 to 2017 was to cut employment by seven percent per year and eliminate facilities. So despite falling revenue, the operating income in the last two years has been flat.Outside the core business, the income swings were wild. In 2015, a $1.1 billion charge for discontinued operations from the split was posted. Taxes in 2017 were up $400 million because of the reduced tax loss carry forward value caused by the tax cut. Fuji Xerox accounting problems reduced the book value of the Fuji Xerox investment.The table below summarizes the last three years of Xerox Income with the 2018 management projection. Adjusted operating income eliminates restructuring costs, and non-service pension costs, and other costs, which appear every year. This table does not include these adjustments. Operating Income is per GAAP.Xerox equipment ranges from $200 printers available from Amazon, to a $100,000 ink jet press that prints at 833 feet per minute. Reviews of desktop printers in PCmag rate Xerox as excellent with outstanding print quality and software, but they do not win the Editor’s Choice Award because of higher cost. Ratings of office printers are similar. In the third quarter of 2017, Xerox introduced 29 new products. They identified three markets with the greatest potential: multi-function color desktop printers with legal paper capabilities, high-speed color presses, and equipment under Managed Document Services agreements. These areas increased to 42% of revenue in 2017, up 2 percentage points. Xerox reduced costs $1.2 billion in 2016 and 2017, and expects another $475 million of cuts in 2018. Some of these cost reduction are just necessary cuts to accommodate lower volume, but others are permanent. In 2017, Xerox stopped selling receivables and reduced the unfunded pension liability. The projected GAAP 2018 EPS of $2.40 cents per share is up 27%.Can they achieve that? Revenue in Q1 was down 0.8% compared to the 3% decline projected, so it may happen. The first quarter equipment sale revenue was down 2.7%, but the unit sales were up except for high-end Black and White printers. Higher equipment unit sales generate increased service and supplies revenue.This is about the value of Xerox, not Icahn, but the upside depends on not just his having fun but whether he succeeds. I believe what really set him off is that Fuji was putting no money into the deal. It was a leveraged buyout, which is fine if he does it, but not if others do it with his money. The estimate of savings from combination with Fuji is $1.7 billion per year is credible. It would make the combined Xerox the largest printer company. The $1.7 billion is $6 per share. If Xerox gets half, it is $ 3 per share, pretax. It would take 2 to 4 years to achieve the full savings.The table below indicates the approximate value at the current GAAP P/E of 14.8. This ratio reflects the potential for stock price growth.EPS Share Price2017 Core Results 1.89 282018 Management Projection 2.40 362018 Projection + Combination 4.65 70Icahn wants a search for other companies. This does not rule out Fuji with a different structure. Fuji Xerox has an exclusive area which includes China and Korea. So if Xerox were sold to another company its printers would remain barred from this territory, and it would lose benefits from mutual research. Both companies need this deal and it could happen."

In a blistering opinion issued in that case, the judge concluded that the Fuji deal was so tainted with conflict that it was likely that CEO Jeff Jacobson and the board, aided and abetted by Fuji, had breached their fiduciary duties owed to Xerox shareholders. The first injunction bars Xerox from holding a shareholder vote on the mind numbingly complex Fuji transaction. The second injunction bars Xerox from enforcing its advance notice bylaw. This means that the lame duck board may no longer deny shareholders their fundamental right to nominate an alternative slate of directors who are committed to enhancing value for ALL shareholders rather than rushing into a no-premium deal with Fuji to further their own personal interests.The Deason litigation matters now more than ever. As we write this letter, the lame duck Xerox board is filing an appeal to fight the judge’s clear and definitive opinion, an action done solely to look out for themselves individually and to help their partner, Fuji. This appeal allows Fuji to have a hand in deciding the future of Xerox, which is both unconscionable and inappropriate. The future of Xerox should be decided by Xerox shareholders and its board, not a third party that has a track record of underhanded and one-way dealings with Xerox. This appeal is yet another mind-boggling example of this lame duck board choosing itself, and Fuji, over Xerox shareholders.We seem not to be alone in our amazement over the most recent shenanigans pulled by the lame duck Xerox board, most notably in refusing to follow through with the leadership and governance changes we agreed to in our settlement agreement that expired last week.Here is just a small sampling of the overwhelmingly negative commentary that has been published since that self-interested flip-flop was disclosed –“Now it’s just more uncertainty…..We don’t know if the deal is back on. There’s something happening behind the scenes, which does not raise confidence in the deal or the company.” – Scott Deveau, Xerox CEO to Stay in Surprise U-Turn, Setting Up Icahn Proxy War (Bloomberg, May 4, 2018).“Xerox’s directors have snatched defeat for the company from the jaws of a partial victory. Tuesday’s settlement with activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason has foundered over extra legal protection for board members who were set to leave. They and discredited Chief Executive Jeff Jacobson will stay for now, leaving Xerox and its investors in limbo…..The settlement would have brought a new CEO and a revamped board. But in addition to a contractual indemnification and release from liability, the departing directors – a group including Chuck Prince, who led Citigroup into the financial crisis and outstayed his welcome there, too – wanted additional reassurance from [Judge] Ostrager, who declined to give it right away…..It’s hard to see other potential buyers or partners working with the current directors and a CEO the board already decided once to replace last year and who just escaped a second near-departure. And as recently as Tuesday, they said the changes agreed with Icahn and Deason were in the best interest of Xerox and it shareholders…..Jacobson, Prince and the other directors involved are jamming the company’s future for the sake of their own.” – Richard Beales, Xerox Directors Jam Company’s Future for Their Own (Reuters Breakingviews, May 4, 2018).“Over the recent decades this American icon of industry has failed to adapt to changes in the world and inflicted a series of injuries on itself. It should not have been a surprise that the company would turn ever more inward-looking as it headed towards its inevitable demise. What is painful to watch is its loss of dignity on the way to its corporate death. The flip-flops in control over this week are not good and will leave everyone confused and angry, accelerating and deepening the pain.” – George Bradt, Lessons From Xerox’s Undignified Death Throes (Forbes, May 4, 2018).“This leaves the future of XRX cloaked in uncertainty and as we see it, it puts a lid on the stock…..About all we’re comfortable predicting at this point is Jacobson and the six directors that agreed to step down will be gone at some point. Whether that is through a new settlement, a proxy loss, or a sale to Fuji, Jacobson will not be CEO.” – Research Report, Xerox throws a nasty changeup (Gordon Haskett, May 4, 2018).“While shareholders twist in the wind, the board and CEO get to hide behind corporate indemnity while waiting for a “Hail Mary” according to the CEO, and competitors are already targeting the company’s customers and employees…..In appointing Jeff Jacobson, a long time Rochester Xerox and Kodak executive who came equipped with a law degree and an Ivy League education, the board failed to recognize that nimble corporate governance is now part of the core skillset of the CEO. Shareholder lawsuits reveal that inside Xerox has a culture of poor corporate governance, tone-deaf ear to shareholder activists (who owned 15% of the company) and a board hopelessly broken by divided loyalties…..The ending to the Xerox roller coaster is not far off, and it will begin with the phrase “you can’t make this stuff up.”” – Jeff Cunningham, Inside The Xerox Boardroom Saga (Chief Executive, May 7, 2018).We could go on and on. And we fully intend to do so. We see several paths to victory – but none of them involve selling a 50.1% interest in Xerox in a deal that offers no control premium and leaves shareholders vulnerable to oppression by an overlord that is embroiled in an ever-widening accounting scandal. We are aware of the market speculation regarding a rival bid by Apollo and we are confident that other potential buyers are waiting in the wings to kick the tires – but we do not see any possibility of an alternative bid materializing unless and until the lame duck board and the lame duck CEO relinquish their death grip on Xerox. To put to rest the speculation regarding our intentions, we are comfortable stating that an all-cash bid at a minimum of $40 per share, would require our serious consideration. However, we also see the possibility of similar or better value in a standalone Xerox with John Visentin at the helm as CEO with the support of a new conflict-free board.We call on the Xerox board to do something it has failed to do on countless occasions: put Xerox shareholders first and immediately end this unrest. This will require the Xerox board to do the following:Over the next few months, we intend to see that “massively conflicted” Jeff Jacobson and old guard directors like Bob Keegan, Ann Reese and Chuck Prince, who have already done so much damage to Xerox, and are continuing to do more damage with these actions, are held fully and personally liable for their misconduct. Similarly, we intend to see that Fujifilm is held fully liable as an aider and abettor of the continuing breaches of fiduciary duties by those directors.We will continue our fight to rescue and revitalize Xerox, as so many of our fellow shareholders have been encouraging us to do. We urge anyone with questions about the future of Xerox to contact us to be put in touch with CEO-in-waiting John Visentin. As he has been doing over the last several weeks, Mr. Visentin will continue to focus on strategic alternatives for Xerox as a consultant to us in connection with our campaign to replace the lame duck board.Sincerely yours,Carl Icahn, Darwin Deason#lameduckboard #lameduckCEOEditor's Note: This article discusses one or more securities that do not trade on a major U.S. exchange.

Xerox is a buy.,"Chart: Finbox.ioXerox (XRX) CEO promises a plan in February to re-energize the business and its underutilized technical strengths. His achievements are sufficient to push up the stock price in a difficult technology market. Xerox is a high Beta stock in a declining printer market. Success requires becoming more effective in the printer/copier market and expanding into adjacent markets that utilize similar technology. To date, expense cuts have improved the operating income margin by a percentage point and increased the cash flow. The stock is a buy.Xerox Iridesse 120 copy per minute color pressPhoto: XeroxJohn Visentin, the new CEO, promotes four objectives:The drive to increase revenue has not produced results. Xerox sales declined 5.8% year over year. Revenue declined 4.7 % in 2017, so declining revenue is a long-standing problem with inflation-adjusted prices declining approximately 5%. The view of Xerox is that they have good products but that they are expensive.Xerox raised the margin on equipment sales by 5 percentage points but had to cut margins on post sales, so the total margins remained the same.Xerox has grown its Managed Document Services to 36% of revenue. Renewal of these accounts is only 79% vs. the plan of 85%. Xerox has made major changes in the sales organization, its compensation, and review sales contract profitability etc. This may have complicated the selling.The CEO says there will not be a quick fix on revenue. Actions, such as expanded channel presence, take time.In the quarter, Xerox had several achievements that should increase sales in future periods. The most significant was being the only vendor to receive security clearance for cloud-based managed print services for the U.S. government. It also launched an ecommerce platform to sell apps for Connectkey printers.Xerox has not stopped the revenue decline, but it has out-run it with cost reductions. This exceeds the revenue decline. Selling, Administrative, and General costs declined by 0.4 percentage points of revenue, and pre-tax revenue increased $25 million. Management expects continued cuts in the fourth quarter. Its main program the ""Own It"" assigns responsibility for tasks to individuals and assigns them authority for improving the process.Xerox is also working to reduce the product cost. Most of the product cost comes from Fuji Xerox. Xerox will no longer automatically buy from Fuji. They are also working to eliminate configurations that are essentially the same and pressing for greater commonality. All of these activities have high payoff in the next generation. At the lower end of the product line, new products are introduced very quickly.John Visentin has hinted that Xerox is exploring exciting new products to be revealed in the February presentation. He has discussed the following possibilities.3D printing - Xerox sells print nozzles to 3D printer OEMs. The company could produce the 3D printers themselves with unique features.Printing electronic circuits - Some of these circuits could be done on the products for identification.Software - Systems developed for the Xerox products can be sold to other customers.Xerox has a very strong position in ink jet that it developed and Xerography. It has not pushed new products to take advantage of their strengths.Xerox cash flow for the quarter was $274 million. This led to an increase in the full year projection of $1.0 to $1.1 billion. This led to increasing the full year share repurchases expectation of 700 to 500 million. The GAAP EPS was 34 cents per share down 33 cents per year from prior year. After tax earnings were hit with a $95 million charge for miss estimating the 2017 tax cut law.Xerox did report adjusted earnings per share of 85 cents, 8 cents per share better than the Zack's consensuses. At $2.35 billion, sales were $68 million below expectation.In the quarter, Xerox returned $353 million to shareholders in dividends and share buybacks. It pays a 3.3% dividend.The imagining business has been improved, but it has considerable work to do to stop the revenue slide and generate a reasonable return on assets. Xerox spends $400 million in research and development. It has a deep technology base the can be of value outside its traditional markets. Successful work in adjacent markets will also take time. The launching of these activities with a credible plan will excite investors and lead investors to see upsides and increase the stock price. Xerox is a buy."
4163668,67473,2018-04-18T04:50:18-04:00,,"Xerox’s Two Largest Individual Shareholders Release Presentation on Rescuing and Revitalizing the CompanyNew York, New York, April 17, 2018 – Today, Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason released the following open letter to shareholders of Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX):Fellow Shareholders:As promised, today we released a presentation explaining why Xerox shareholders need to vote to replace certain directors and to oppose the proposed Fuji scheme.Both the substance of the proposed value-destroying transaction and the conflict-tainted process by which it was hatched are an insult to long-suffering Xerox shareholders and make a mockery of well-established corporate governance norms.Fuji - with the able assistance of Xerox CEO Jeff Jacobson - appears to have been successful in putting one over on the board of directors of Xerox. However, the market cannot be so easily tricked. The closing price of Xerox stock last Friday (April 13, 2018), before many of the sordid details came to light, was $28.17 per share, which is approximately 14% below the closing price on the day prior to the announcement of the scheme and approximately 37% below management’s purported deal value of $45.00 per share.Noted Columbia law school Professor John Coffee summarized the transaction and the process behind it as follows: “This is a strange and irregular transaction that is simply not comparable to any other transaction I have seen in over 45 years of observing the ‘merger and acquisition’ marketplace. A CEO of the target, facing likely ouster, serves as the loyal agent of the acquirer, designing a deal that is too good to be true: a cheap price, little governance protections, no market check, and a process that ignores other bidders.”We could not have said it better ourselves.We fully expect that Xerox will not prevail in its shameful attempt to keep hidden from shareholders the many other sordid facts surrounding this unfortunate transaction that are still being concealed due to the machinations of Xerox’s lawyers. Despite their attempts to bury the truth, the fundamental economics of the scheme - which dramatically undervalue Xerox and disproportionately favor Fuji - are undeniable. Therefore, we are confident you will agree that the only choice here is to vote out the worst of Xerox’s directors and to oppose the proposed Fuji scheme.We look forward to engaging with you further over the upcoming weeks and months. Please stay tuned for more.Sincerely yours,Carl IcahnDarwin DeasonDisclosure: None."
4144006,33291,2018-02-07T10:11:31-05:00,"While Xerox has restructured and is slowly turning around, based on our projections and expectations the name is to be avoided.The top line is essentially stagnant, while expenses are well managed.Cash flows and cash position are bullish for the company, and investors should closely watch how the company uses its cash position in the next year or so.Considering our earnings projections, the yield here is not enticing enough to speculate on the company delivering successfully at just over 3%.","When we initiated coverage on Xerox (XRX) we concluded that the stock wasn't dead. This once-stellar blue chip has certainly fallen from grace, big time, and has been struggling for a long time since. While the yield had attracted dividend investors, growth has been nowhere to be found for what feels like several years. The name has been searching to regain its footing following the completion of the split of Conduent and after it also underwent a 1-for-4 reverse split to shore up the share price. In this column, we check back in with the name to examine trends in key metrics that you should be aware of. In addition, we offer our projections for 2018, and based on what we expect, we consider Xerox a name that should still be avoided here.After the restructuring and a reverse split, we have got to start seeing some growth in sales. The company under its management has committed to focuses on improving its business lines and returning to growth. Well, here in Q4, revenues were stagnant:*2015 revenues adjusted for divestiture into ConduentSource: SEC filingsWe are pleased that revenues did not drop off as reported, with revenue coming in at $2.75 billion. As reported, they edged higher by 0.7% from last year. That said, on a currency neutral basis, the top line technically dipped 2%. However, this was better than the $2.73 billion, or flat sales from last year that we expected coming into this report. We were more bullish than the Street coincidentally, and as such Xerox's top line surpassed consensus by $100 million in sales. This is welcomed news. The question is however, what were the company's costs and did they impact earnings?While sales were a bit light, margins and cash flows were both strong positives in the quarter, as total expenses were down slightly. Total costs and expenses fell to $2.52 billion from $2.56 billion last year. Much of this decline stemmed from lower restructuring related costs, and lower 'other' expenses, while the costs of sales and services were up marginally, 1.4% and 0.5%, respectively.We were pleased to see that adjusted operating margin improved this quarter to 14.4%, while gross margins were a solid 40.4%. Both rose, increasing 0.2 points and 0.1 points, respectively. This led to earnings rising in the fourth quarter:*adjusted earnings per shareSource: SEC filingsAs you can see, earnings per share were up 4%. What is also impressive is that this $1.04 in earnings per share surpassed our estimates by $0.04, while surpassing the more conservative street consensus by $0.08.In terms of cash flow, the company burnt $28 million due to a $350 million charge related to accounts receivable sales programs. This is a one-time item, and on an adjusted basis, Xerox produced $322 million cash from operations during the fourth quarter, and $972 million for the year. The company ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.3 billion, improving over the year. The cash position is one of the most bullish aspects of the report, and investors should closely eye how this cash is utilized in the next year or so. As we look ahead, we anticipate performance in 2018 will be similar to 2017.Based on the trajectory of the company and what we view as a success of the strategic transformation, we are targeting revenues of $10.2 to $10.4 billion as reported, about flat from 2017. We expect comparable operating margins as well, and based on actual expenses, they should come in around 12.5% to 13.5%, while operating cash flows should be $850 to $950 million. Thanks to a lower tax impact, we anticipate growth in the bottom line in 2018. We see adjusted earnings per share of $3.55-$3.80.Sales continue to be disappointing overall, however, the company is beginning to right the ship after years of declines, and even managed to surpass expectations. There are some strong positives here, particularly in the company's cash position, but there is much work to be done. The yield here is not enticing enough to speculate on the company delivering successfully at just over 3%. If anything, we expect the stock to trade in a narrow range unless our expectations are exceeded handily next year. Keep a close watch on expenses, as these will be the key drivers of performance since we are expecting flat sales. While we are not bullish, we wouldn't' sell after the recent pullback we have seen. Thus, we rate the stock a hold at present levels.Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

4131547,67113,2017-12-13T09:08:36-05:00,Valuation and dividend may look attractive at present but transition still remains in doubt.Operating and gross margins have been falling since 2014.Mobile platforms and digitization will continue to make the pot smaller for a whole host of current players.,"Xerox Corp (NYSE:XRX) came across my desk this morning from a stock screener as a potential value play. Viable value plays are becoming increasingly more difficult to find these days due to the relentless rally in US stock markets. The screener I ran was the following.On the surface, these numbers look very impressive. Yes the dividend pay-out amount may have been cut but we are still looking at a 3.3+% yield here which is much higher than the average in this industry or the S&P500 for that matter which are at about the 2% mark. Value investors will be well aware that Xerox traded north of $57 a share around 3 years ago to this very day. However the Xerox of today is a totally different company from even 3 years past.The company is in the process of transitioning the company into more of a service orientated one as the fundamentals for core print spend in-company doesn't look that favorable going forward. Despite the attractive numbers in the table above, here are some reasons why I believe Xerox is not a value play at present.Firstly when revenue dropped in 2014 to under $13 billion, both operating margins and gross margins increased to 10.9% and 40.3% respectively. However both of these metrics have been declining since then which is a worry. When attempting to ascertain whether a company has a competitive advantage, I often look to margins to see how they have been holding up. I just don't like the fact that the operating income average growth percentage over the past 3 years has been -11%.Gross profit margin came in at 38.9% in the most recent quarter which again was down on the 39.44% print in the same quarter of 12 months prior. It is very difficult for operating margins to remain buoyant when both gross income and gross margins are dropping. Bulls will state that the managed print services side of the business plus the company's robust cost cutting program will be able to offset the expected sustained drop in the equipment side of the business. This may be true but are we only only delaying the inevitable. Are Xerox's growth triggers game changers for the company ? I recommend value investors look at the fundamentals of this industry and then invest accordingly.Whether its the digitization of documents or the explosion of smart-phones, I just don't see print services being in high demand going forward whether from in-house printing or managed third-party services. Furthermore as the market thins over-time, you will see more and more competition entering the fray. This scenario does nothing for expanding margins going forward although the company's cost-reduction program will definitely buy Xerox some time here.Bulls will state that the proliferation of mobile devices such as powerful smartphones and tablets will mean much more printing being done from mobile platforms and to one extent, this may be true. However what bulls are missing is that these very items are also becoming a strong alternative to printing especially with screen sizes and power outputs growing every year.Carl Icahn, the company's biggest shareholder stated very frankly recently that not enough new products have been brought to market by the firm in recent years. The problem however is that an elevated acquisition rate is both risky from a cost perspective but also more importantly in a sector where forward looking fundamentals don't look all that strong. Therefore either from a valuation standpoint or from the dividend perspective, the downside risk in Xerox is too large at present to warrant a long term play to the long side."
4099948,103480,2017-08-17T18:21:14-04:00,"Xerox has made great strides during the previous year in shedding non-core assets and driving its primary businesses into the modern landscape.75% of its business is in recurring services, making it highly similar to subscription-based SaaS companies that sport much higher valuations.Xerox offers great upside trading at ~10x forward earnings (vs. large-cap tech names trading at twice that) and 40% under its all-time high.","Value is terribly difficult to find in the technology sector. Most of the money is chasing after high-flying software and internet startups fresh off their IPOs and growing enormously, but posting correspondingly large losses. Investing in tech almost certainly means investing in growth, but to be truly diversified in tech, an investor needs some value in the mix as well. These are the companies with rich bottom lines that won’t get crushed when the NASDAQ sells off (recent software IPOs plunged 4%+ on the North Korea news), and they make valuable portfolio components for investors betting on the long-term trends of workflow automation, increased reliance on IT, and growing focus on data and analytics; without the wild price gyrations that new issues go through. One such technology company is Xerox (NYSE: XRX) trading at a paltry ~10x forward earnings. This company certainly needs no introduction to the average person (we all know it well as the maker of its ubiquitous print and copy machines), but perhaps it needs a re-introduction to investors. One interesting thing to note about Xerox: like the SaaS companies that are so dearly loved by the Street, Xerox’s business comprises of 76% recurring annuity revenue. The market really doesn’t like pure hardware businesses - companies that sell equipment for one-time revenue and then have to make up all that volume again next year to keep the top line flat - but Xerox is no longer one of them. It has a full portfolio of services and solutions built around its core printer business that are now larger than core printer sales. Until we all decide to stop using paper (unlikely), Xerox’s print and document services are still going to command a healthy amount of enterprise spend. True, this is not an exciting growth market with seemingly unlimited growth potential - it’s not Hadoop or predictive analytics - but it is still an $85bn, steady industry in which Xerox reigns king. Xerox might not be Software-as-a-Service, but it is still provides a core recurring service to enterprise clients (we’d suggest Print-as-a-Service as a moniker; unfortunately, PaaS is already taken as an acronym for platform technologies).This article will give a brief rundown on the new Xerox and provide a recap on its most recent results to show investors that this is not a dying business; rather, a valuable cash cow sitting on steady recurring businesses and rewarding patient investors with a 3% dividend yield as well as a chance for growth, having fallen ~40% from recent highs.Having existed under the radar for the past few years, most investors need a refresher on what the Xerox company does these days. It still churns out the printers it’s known for, but it also has a host of services businesses around it.Xerox operates in three segments:75% of Xerox’s revenues are “post-sale based"", comprising of document services and maintenance services following the sale of equipment, providing recurring revenue stability and predictability. Xerox operates in a consultative fashion, helping enterprise clients as well as SMBs to set up their physical workplace infrastructures and manage their internal use of resources.Xerox operates on a global scale, with international revenues comprising 41% of sales. At the beginning of the year, Xerox had guided to negative currency impacts due to the strength of the U.S. dollar. But now, as the dollar has depreciated heavily against almost every major currency, Xerox should see FX impacts as a strong tailwind to 2017 earnings. In the first six months of 2017, Xerox posted $5.0bn in revenues, down 7% from 1H16 revenues of $5.4bn. Despite the revenue slide, what we like about the revenue picture is that the sales mix tilted 1 percent toward recurring post-sale revenues. See chart below from Xerox's 10-Q:Figure 1. 1H17 revenue resultsEquipment sales were 22% of revenues in 1H16, but has since fallen to 21% in 1H17. While this may seem like a meaningless shift in the short term, a continued shift toward post-sale revenues will help stabilize Xerox's business, as the general shrinkage in the printer and document business hits equipment sales twice as hard as post-sale revenues (12% decline in equipment sales vs. 6% in post-sale revenues). Underpinning this thesis is the idea that Xerox's transition toward recurring revenues will help it to find a bottom in its year-on-year declines and return to growth.On a constant currency basis, revenues only fell 5% in 1H17 - a manageable, acceptable number during the normal phases of the business cycle.Another note on the top-line: Xerox is making a renewed push on marketing products toward the SMB segment, and seemingly succeeding: in Q2, total equipment installs in the ""Entry-Level"" customer segment (the higher tiers are Mid-Range and High-End) increased 24% for color devices and increased 10% for black-and-white devices. SMBs are a massive, low-touch market segment that could prove highly lucrative for Xerox, especially if it manages to upsell its bundled annuity services along with equipment.Annuity businesses are meaningless if customers don't renew their contracts. Fortunately for Xerox, renewal rates have also seen meaningful upticks. On an ARR (annual recurring revenue) basis, Xerox posted a renewal rate of 86% for 1H17, up from 82% for full-year 2016 and 78% for full-year 2015. We acknowledge that SMBs are quicker to churn than enterprise clients, so this upward trend may see some risk if Xerox continues padding its book of business with mom-and-pop shops, but for now the strong renewal rates support the narrative that Xerox is successfully transitioning to recurring revenues.Turning to costs: in 2016, Xerox launched what it called a “Strategic Transformation Program,” which aims to refocus Xerox on its core businesses and spun off its Business Process Outsourcing business as a new publicly traded company, Conduent (NYSE: CNDT). These measures are expected to achieve $1.5bn in cost savings over the next three years. Averaging this figure out on a per annum basis, an estimated $500 million of annual savings would boost Xerox’s net income of $616 million (2016) almost twofold. In connection with this restructuring, Xerox’s profits suffered in 2016 partially due to $224 million of severance costs related to 3,250 layoffs, but these actions are expected to yield pretax savings of $140 million in 2017 alone.These savings already have made an apparent, albeit slight impact in 2017 results: despite a $226 million top-line decline, Xerox managed to eke out an increase in pretax profits - $193 million in 2Q17 vs. $191 million in 2Q16, improving pretax margins to a respectable 7.5% of revenues.These cuts indicate that Xerox's new management team (Jeff Jacobson took over as CEO in January 2017 from the long-tenured Ursula Burns) is more than willing to make mature decisions about trimming the business to adapt to Xerox's new environment. Even with a thinner top line, Xerox looks like it's still capable of running a lean operation and delivering growing profits.The outlook for 2017, however, has sent many investors searching for the exits. Management expects a ""mid-single digits"" decline in revenue, with deceleration to soften (and maybe turn into growth) in the second half, owing to new product launches. Operating cash flows are expected to between $700-$800 million, down about 20% from 2016. At its current market cap of $8.2bn, Xerox is only trading slight above 10x its operating cash flows, a steep discount to the broader market. And bear in mind that as recently as 2014, Xerox was generating $1.3bn in OCF, a figure achievable once more after the company's $500 million-per-year cost reduction initiative has been fully executed.Xerox isn't sliding off a cliff into oblivion - it's declining slowly, at a manageable rate, and declines in revenue are being accompanied by strong cost savings. While tech investors are wary of the top line and treat almost everything else as secondary, it's necessary to realize that Xerox is still operating a cash cow that generates annuity revenue from services that are basic necessities, immune to wild gyrations like the rest of technology.Xerox isn't the most exciting name to hold in a portfolio, especially for tech-driven investors looking to capitalize on new and hot technologies. However, it's necessary to keep in mind that the enterprise technology landscape - especially in hardware - is full of steady, legacy technologies that are difficult to replace.Lack of investment in these ""boring"" tech disciplines by startups and venture capital have left the field wide open for Xerox to excite and surprise customers (to the extent that ""boring"" products can) with little competition. This isn't a tech titan challenged by secular trends - like HP, whose desktop sales are flagging due to a shift toward tablet and mobile computing, or Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO), whose legacy server business is fending off the cloud and containerization. After all, it's hard to imagine what could displace printers and paper.Xerox's stock, trading under 10x forward earnings (consensus calls for EPS of $3.36 in 2017), has priced in years and years of decline, when the bottom may have already been found. Its shift toward annuity services should give the company a stable foothold as it delivers cost savings and returns to EPS growth."
4124407,52932,2017-11-13T15:15:14-05:00,Xerox's third-quarter earnings report was not viewed positively by the market.The company reaffirmed its full year outlook in several metrics.XRX has been aggressively strengthening its balance sheet.,"I recently wrote about Xerox (NYSE:XRX) highlighting the safe nature of investing in its stock and its current undervaluation in the market. At that time shares were hovering around $32, about $3 higher than they are being priced right now. The stock had even rose as high as $34 in late September only to come crashing down after its third-quarter earnings report. Xerox's stock chart since I last covered it here on Seeking Alpha:XRX data by YChartsI am circling back here to reiterate my stance on Xerox as and undervalued and safe investment for the long term.So what about Xerox's Third Quarter spooked investors so much? Revenue was down 5% or 5.9% on a constant currency basis year-over-year (the decline actually improved sequentially) but that is to be expected and also in line with guidance provided by the company while operating margin and cash flow were also in line. Adjusted EPS was up 6% at $0.89/share. XRX's post-sale revenues, one of the major reasons I am bullish on the stock, remained steady as a percentage of revenue at 79%. These revenues were down 3.9% or 4.8% constant currency compared to last year but CEO Jeffrey Jacobsen noted on the Earnings Conference Call that post-sale revenue is expected to be stable over time as ""equipment revenue improves and placements grow"". Xerox ended the quarter with $1.8 billion in cash and $6 billion in debt. There were a few negative items mentioned on the call but nothing that should have caused Xerox shares to lose about 10% of their value. The benefit of strategic initiatives was more than offset by transaction currency losses and lower equity income to arrive at an adjusted operating margin of 12.2%, a 40 basis point decline year over year. However, management reaffirmed the full year range for adjusted op margin of 12.5%-13.5%. There will also be a one-time charge in Q4 that results in a negative impact of $350 million to cash flow. This is related to an accounts receivable sales program that the company has had in place for 8 years now but no longer deems necessary. Removal of this tool will result in $10 million in cost savings annually.Speaking of cost savings, the bold pledge of a $1.5 billion reduction in expenses over the next few years is so far proceeding very well. According to CFO William Osburn on the Earnings Call, the goal to realize $600 million of that target in 2017 is proceeding well and the company is on track to meet or exceed that goal. The figure of $400 million is a potential target for 2018 but the company's final capital allocation plan for next year will be laid out in its fourth-quarter earnings report. This aggressive cost cutting (and a $1.8 billion cash infusion resulting from the Conduent) has allowed the company to focus on improving its balance sheet, primarily in the form of debt reduction and pension contributions.Source: Xerox 10-qThis past quarter saw an eye-catching $671 million contribution to the company's underfunded pension which still requires $1.7 billion more. There was also an early redemption of some of the XRX's 2018 notes for $475 million. Xerox required the assistance $1 billion note issuance but this debt carries a coupon rate of 3.625% as opposed to the 6.35% rate of the debt that was retired. I understand that the debt and pension figures can be worrisome but I point back to Xerox's post-sale revenues because they are more stable than the revenue generated from equipment sales. Almost 80% of the company's revenue stream can be looked at essentially as an annuity that consistently brings cash in door. While they are naturally a function of equipment sales it is not a direct correlation as equipment sales can slow dramatically with a mitigated impact on post-sale revenue as the company continues to service products already sold. The combination of significant cost reduction and consistent cash flow gives me confidence in Xerox's ability to gradually reduce the large figures found on the right side of its balance sheet.Another interesting point regarding the stock's post-earnings drop is that there were no negative revisions to full year guidance. Adjusted EPS is guided to fall between $3.28-$3.44, the midpoint of which provides a price/earnings ratio of about 8.7x. Add in a 3% dividend yield and this stock is clearly being undervalued by the market. When I last wrote about Xerox, the eleven analysts following the stock had an average price target of $36.11 according to the Wall Street Journal, which represented 11.1% upside from where the stock was trading. That mean estimate has now risen modestly to $36.72 which, due to the undeserved drop in the stock, implies 25.5% upside. It's not often that you come across a stock that is pitched as a safe investment but can also provide a 25% return.The reaction from investors to Xerox's third-quarter earnings report has me scratching my head. Of course the company isn't perfect, but if it was it probably wouldn't be so undervalued. There were no big negative surprises stemming from the report and nothing that would change the long term fundamentals of Xerox. I was confident in the stock at $32; none of that confidence has dissipated and the stock is now 10% cheaper. Xerox is a strong buy at these levels."
4096661,52932,2017-08-08T23:23:03-04:00,Shares of Xerox have performed well since its spin-off of Conduent.The company is planning strategic changes that will enhance profitability.Is the market applying a fair valuation to Xerox shares?,"Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) is often overlooked when investors think of technology companies. The tech sector is full of high growth names like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN); so ""old tech"" names that don't still command significant media attention that giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) garner tend to be afterthoughts. Even when most people look for a stable company with a solid yield they are likely to scour other sectors like telecommunications or consumer packaged goods. The fact of the matter is Xerox fits the bill for both of these descriptions (technology and strong dividend payments). XRX generated 79% of its second-quarter 2017 revenue from post-sale services, thus disconnecting much of its revenue stream from sales volatility and boasts a yield of approximately 3%. According to Wall Street Journal estimates, Xerox is trading at 9.73x 2017 earnings and 9.1x 2018 earnings at the time of writing.It appears as if the market has (partially) forgotten about Xerox. This observation is somewhat understandable given that the technology sector is generally dominated by much flashier players with high growth figures. If you're not buying the assertion that XRX is flying under the radar, simply ask yourself when's the last time you saw a breaking news headline on WSJ, CNBC, or Seeking Alpha that mentioned the printer company of yesteryear? The answer may even predate Seeking Alpha itself. Any underappreciated stock presents a potential opportunity for investors, but is Xerox a worthwhile investment?On December 31st, Xerox completed its spin-off of Conduent, which now trades under NYSE:CNDT, allowing it to narrow its focus and provide consistent returns to shareholders. As is the case with many spin-offs, XRX had a list of strategic initiatives that it unveiled to investors including the following:As of June 30th, the company has delivered on its promises; all following figures are derived from Xerox's Q2 2017 Earnings Report. Second-quarter operating margin was 13.3%, a 40-basis point improvement year-over-year, with the expectation of a full-year 2017 operating margin between 12.5% and 13.5%. Of the $1.5 billion in savings targeted by the company, $600 million of it is expected to be realized in 2017 and is progressing well, leading CFO Bill Osburn to this comment on the Q2 Earnings Conference Call: ""The last key measurement is strategic transformation. We're very pleased with our results to-date, and we are on track to deliver our target $600 million of gross savings in 2017.""Xerox currently has $5 billion in gross debt, after retiring $1.3 billion in the first quarter; the company generated $322 million in free cash flow in Q2 alone. With regard to pension funding, Xerox has contributed only $46 million in the first half of 2017 of the planned $350 million for the full year. However, the back-loaded nature of these payments was planned for.In the second paragraph I described Xerox as being ""(partially) forgotten"" by the market because although it isn't making the front page of many websites, its share price has seen solid appreciation over the last six months:XRX data by YChartsA big chunk of this appreciation came after the Q2 earnings report as some investors realized the value in Xerox shares. I would argue, however, that there is still considerable upside to be had (along with a nice dividend to serve as an extra reward for shareholders). According to the Wall Street Journal, of the eleven analysts covering the stock, eight have assigned a ""buy"" or ""overweight"" rating to Xerox shares. The average price target of these analysts is $36.11, representing a further 11.1% return from current levels. If Xerox were to rise to that price target, shares would still be trading at only 10.1x FY2018 earnings.Xerox is not the sexiest name out there, especially not in the technology sector, but that does not mean it is a bad investment. On the contrary, as a certain Peter Lynch would agree, ""boring"" companies sometimes offer great value that many investors miss out on. Xerox most likely will not and should not command a massive price to earnings ratio but the 9.7x it is trading at right now is far too low, especially with the market reaching all-time new highs at an incredible pace. Along with the cushion of a 3% yield, shares of Xerox Corporation are undervalued at current levels."

XRX has been faithfully providing some income to shareholders since at least 1985.Activist investors, or at least the actions thereof: Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason prevented the execution of a rather poor deal with Fujifilm to sell a controlling stake in Xerox, achieved the removal and replacement of potentially conflicted directors and a CEO, saving the company $18 million in the process of the CEO's departure.Things to hateDrama. The above success of Icahn and Deason do not mean the company is out of the woods. Due to the scrapped deal with Fujifilm, there may still be additional costs as Fuji has promised litigation.Uncertainty. With the above potential litigation from Fujifilm and an apparent desire by Icahn and Deason to potentially sell Xerox, any buyer of XRX stock does accept some unknown. In the context of this portfolio and with the amount of risk associated with each position, this is not a problem. However, in a more discretionary approach to investing, caution may be a good idea.Future Expectations/HopesCarl Icahn has stated he would support an offer of $40/share for XRX from a potential buyer. Such an offer would place the share price almost on par with its current Graham number ($41.43); any coinciding changes to book value or earnings per share might knock it out of our screen criteria.Until such a time as the company goes private or has the share price driven up by arbitrage, I suspect it will remain a member of this list where it will give a quarterly dividend for the foreseeable future. As depicted in the chart below, the last time XRX traded in a range which would have exceeded its Graham number was around 2000.XRX data by YChartsWorks for my purposes. I think most value investors would be happy to hold a severely undervalued stock that was giving them a consistent dividend."

        The company continues its Strategic Transformation plan.
        Xerox pays down 20% of its debt.","Investment ThesisThe market was unimpressed with Xerox's (NYSE:XRX) quarterly earnings. However, I remain bullish. The company's Strategic Transformation continues to get traction and I believe the company remains undervalued.XRX data by YChartsBusiness OverviewIn my previous article I discussed the key areas of the Strategic Transformation in the new Xerox:1) Cost savings2) New product launches3) Areas for growth within document outsourcingCost SavingsXerox's adjusted operating margin was up 0.9% YoY to 11.4% in 2017 Q1. The company set out to trim the fat as part of its Strategic Transformation and it is certainly moving in the correct direction. It was successful cutting costs while total revenue falls 4.3% at constant currency and this ultimately drove operating cash flow to be up $103m QoQ to $190m.New Product LaunchesAdditionally, as the company navigates through its biggest product launch in its history, it stated that the timing of the anticipated impact of upcoming product launches caused a drag in equipment sales revenue which was down 5.7% at constant currency in this segment. Having said that, Xerox believes that it is in fact performing well, both in color-products as well as in developing markets.Document OutsourcingXerox breaks down these printing services under Managed Document Services (""MDS"") within its Equipment Services. Xerox highlights the fact that this quarter it made a small amount of ground as MDS was up 0.2% in constant currency.Interestingly, both Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) and Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP) are also focusing their efforts into printing services. In fact, since mentioning this interesting area of growth in my first Xerox article, Staples has put itself up for sale. In my opinion, since these three companies have focused their efforts in managing printing services there must be a growing market opportunity. It looks set to be an area of intense competition for these three companies.ConclusionXerox is still in the early stages of its turnaround and market so far does not appear to be very interesting in Xerox. This company generates a lot of FCF and has been active delevering its balance sheet, paying back $1.3B of debt in the quarter, leaving only $5B in debt versus $6.3B at the end of the previous quarter, approximately 20% less debt. It currently trades for less than 12 times its full year mid-range guided FCF. No wonder Xerox is an Icahn favorite."
4041601,33291,2017-02-01T14:12:34-05:00,This once-stellar blue chip has certainly fallen from grace.The separation of Conduent is now complete.Q4 earnings are out and I discuss the key metrics as well as the outlook.,"When I initiated coverage on Xerox (NYSE:XRX), I concluded that the stock wasn't dead. This once-stellar blue chip has certainly fallen from grace, big time. I mean, it has been struggling for a long time. I suggested on nice dips you could buy simply for the yield and collect the dividend, but growth was nowhere to be found. I had said in my prior work numerous times that we needed to see some improvement in the underlying metrics before I could get behind the name. Well, in the past three months, the stock has moved sideways to higher, and the completion of the split of Conduent is now complete. The newly created company is essentially Xerox's former business process services segment. Conduent will operate in three segments, healthcare, public sector services and commercial industries, with commercial industries making up nearly half of revenues. The newly leaner Xerox is focusing on the document technology side of things. This move was a value creator. But will there be sustained momentum in Xerox? That is tough to tell, but let's check in on the name to see where we are at.The truth is that performance has been pitiful of late and is the reason shares had declined quarter after quarter. Well here in Q4 we still see declining revenues. Revenue as a whole came in at $2.73 billion, and this missed estimates by $40 million. However, this was also down 7.5% year over year, continuing a string of declining quarters. In addition, the degree of declining revenues seems to be picking up. However, as I have discussed in-depth in other articles, the strong dollar has hurt companies with international businesses.Because of this issue we, we need to look at revenues on a constant dollar basis. Doing so, we still see revenues were down 5% year over year. That is still a huge negative. The bulk of revenue came from annuity. I was also pleased to see that adjusted operating margin improved this quarter to 14.0%, while gross margins were a solid 40%. Declining revenue is of course not a positive, but margin improvement is strong. So that means expenses must be under control, right? Well, total costs and expenses were 23.4% of revenue, which is a solid result, but I would like to see this come in under 20%.In terms of cash flow, Xerox produced $462 million from operations during the fourth quarter, and ended the year with a cash balance of $2.2 billion. Considering revenues and expenses, the company saw earnings of $0.17 per share. Now, we need to factor in some items and in doing so, we see that adjusted earnings came in at $0.25 per share. This actually met estimates.The bottom line? I'm very much looking forward to the performance of the new company now that the separation and split-up of the company is complete. I have opined that Xerox desperately needs a catalyst. Compared to years past, this name is far weaker than it used to be, but the outlook is positive and there is value here. I continue to be concerned with declining revenues, and although margins widened, they have been pressured heavily. As for the new company's outlook, Xerox sees $0.42 to $0.52 cents in earnings from continuing operations, but $0.80 to $0.88 on an adjusted basis. I would be a buyer from a speculative standpoint since there may be some new life in the stock following the separation.Note from the author: Christopher F.

4035769,69295,2017-01-10T18:01:33-05:00,"The spinoff increases the intrinsic value of both companies materially by giving Conduent optionality and Xerox more efficiency on its buyback program.Two companies needed dramatically different management mindset and capital allocation in order to succeed and the spinoff creates the required conditions for both.While their respective goals are not guaranteed to be reached, the possibility of reaching them has just opened up.","Thinking about the Xerox (NYSE:XRX) story on a long enough timeline might be enough to make any observer either chuckle or shake their head in awe or disbelief, though we needn't look that far back in time to see the blatant inefficiencies in corporate America. The Conduent (NASDAQ:CNDT) business line was acquired in 2010 by Xerox to participate in what Xerox perceived to be a smart acquisition that would be accretive to its earnings and future growth potential. The line toted by management at the time was probably far from the reality of the situation. With every claim in the financial world, there is often a flip side to things. Such acquisitions into new and ""growing"" lines of businesses say to me that the acquiring business's management is envious and impatient about getting its share price and market share higher regardless of the bottom-line effect on the value per share calculus over the long term. This turned out to be the case for Xerox's acquisition. It did not capture market share or grow with the market over the years. In fact, it went nowhere and lost profitability. It did $6.5 billion of business in fiscal 2009 and $6.66 billion of business in fiscal 2015. While its market has been growing at a CAGR of ~6%, it's obvious to conclude that Conduent has missed some opportunities along the way in terms of both acquisitions and organic growth.(Source: Conduent's investor presentation)Icahn put together a roughly 8.13% position toward the end of 2015 shortly after Ursula Burns, the CEO of Xerox, announced that the board authorized a review of the structural options for the company. However, at the time, Burns had no plans to support breaking up the company into two pieces. While Burns had stated that although the public thought Icahn was behind the push to separate the company, the board actually came to the same conclusion on its own. Icahn merely applauded the move and agreed with the board. On Twitter, Icahn stated the following:Whether the move was indeed heavily influenced by Icahn or not is irrelevant at this point as it was long overdue and should benefit shareholders' interests much more than keeping the company together.Splitting the two: better late than neverXerox and Conduent, while both in the business service and outsourcing business, are in two distinct markets. Xerox's printer business and document outsourcing business are relatively mature markets with Xerox itself being a major player. While Conduent is still a large player in its market, the market is far larger in relation to Conduent's share versus Xerox's market-to-market share ratio. It is also a growing market. The optimal capital allocation of these two differing business markets could not be any more different. Xerox has limited growth opportunities, but it has a steady stream of cash flows. Conduent has tremendous market opportunities to gain market share and to grow with the market and cash flows to achieve such a goal. However, sometime after the acquisition was made and far too late in my opinion, Xerox realized that this was a terrible mistake. The market was leaving Conduent behind due to the fact that approval for any riskier than usual but likely to be worthwhile expenditures for Conduent's business line had to come from the minds and orthodoxy of Xerox's top executives. Could a team of managers who lead a company that was largely in a stable and slowly declining business hope to recognize and act upon the opportunities presented to their smaller subsidiary which was in a growing and more dynamic industry? I think the answer is obvious at this point. The nature of Conduent's business and industry requires bolder, more creative and growth-oriented thinking.Take the capital allocation plan shown in my previous article, which shows that over $1.1 billion has been spent in each of the past three years to buy back stock and the roughly $290 million per year spent on cash dividends.(Source: Xerox's historical 10-K filings)While such a capital allocation plan may be appropriate for a company like Xerox, it makes almost no sense for Conduent, which was willingly or unwillingly dragged along without much of a say in the matter. The correct capital allocation plan for Conduent would be zero buybacks, zero dividends and 100% of free cash flows in acquisitions and internal R&D. While Xerox may have had some plans to do tuck-in acquisitions for its Conduent business line, the results show that it failed to do so with any success. I attribute such a failure due to the fundamentally different mindsets needed to run each business successfully in today's environment. With the companies now separated into two independent entities, capital allocation will immediately become more efficient since both companies will now be operated with an individualistic approach and an independent managerial mindset.The second immediate improvement from the split is related to capital allocation but focuses more so on the prevailing and desired share price for the stock. A major competitive advantage for a growth stock is actually the price of its shares and its market capitalization. This is the company's cost of capital and in a growth industry segment, this can mean the difference between being left in the history books or being the next big story. Conduent could be marketed as a growth story at some point if it were to develop successfully over time. Xerox will likely always be viewed as being in a shrinking business regardless of whether that is the case or not. Conduent will gain a sizeable advantage if it is allowed to gain a very expensive market capitalization. It can use shares to acquire other companies in both the private and public market at a much smaller expense to shareholders than if their shares were undervalued. Xerox's buyback plan benefits shareholders much more when its shares are priced at a level that's lower than their intrinsic value. The lower the better. Consider the scenario in which Conduent actually wildly succeeds as a subsidiary of Xerox. The successful growth of Conduent would push up the stock price of XRX as a whole. However, Xerox would still allocate capital as per usual with mostly stock buybacks and some dividends. Therefore, capital would be wasted on buying back Conduent's success reflected in XRX's stock price and Conduent would receive none of the benefits of their success that would be reflected in their individual stock ticker price to lower its cost of capital for important acquisitions. In other words, there would be almost no benefit to the combination of Xerox and Conduent under one ticker and company under almost any plausible scenario. It is only due to a flawed thesis believed in by management which implied that somehow Conduent's business would enhance Xerox's overall growth prospects that put the two companies together in the first place. The real results were that the combination stunted Conduent's growth and burdened Xerox's cash returns to shareholders. The disapproval and ultimate reversal of the actions based on this false reasoning will be a value creation event in and of itself.How to think going forwardWhile the spinoff creates value through a major change in the incentive and capital allocation structure of the company, none of this is of any use without actual operating growth for the companies. This is one thing where I must admit that I have no capability to properly estimate with any strong confidence. While there is no guarantee of future success, the possibility to succeed has been created for Conduent and Xerox has effectively decreased the cost of its buyback program which will now accrue more efficiently to shareholders. Both companies have set out their respective goals and can now strive to achieve them without the hindrance of the other. Conduent will likely experience some thoughtless selling for a few days due to Xerox investors getting rid of their shares for various reasons including ignorance of what it is. I continue to hold both positions for now post spinoff."
4060111,69905,2017-04-04T09:48:45-04:00,"Xerox post spinoff looks cheap.
        Investors can follow Icahn's hard work without having to pay for it.
        The company will focus on the printing market.","Investment ThesisIt is important to make sure that when I am buying a stock, someone like Icahn is not selling. But at the end of the day, when I buy a stock, I buy it because I believe it is undervalued. Icahn can drop the stock and I will be left holding it. As I am still holding Valeant (VRX) after Ackman dropped it, because I think there is money to be made from Valeant at the current price. So, in the words of Jack Ma (Alibaba (NYSE:BABA)), ""you have to think for yourself"".XRX data by YChartsIcahn's cost basisTo be conservative I estimated that Icahn's Xerox (NYSE:XRX) purchases averaged a cost basis of $6 (split adjusted for the Conduent (NASDAQ:CNDT) spinoff). Realistically, the cost is most likely higher, but that is a good ballpark to think about.Icahn will have already realized some value to his original purchases in Xerox that starting 15 months ago, but I would not say that his bull thesis has fully played out, yet. There are still plenty of returns still to be made from Xerox at the current price.Had I bought Xerox before the Conduent split, Conduent would have provided some additional return, but as a stand alone company I have no interest in it. It is highly unprofitable and costing slightly more than $3B. Pass.New XeroxXerox, on other hand is interesting as it has a history of generating cash and is certainly cheap. The new Xerox has focused on 3 key areas:1) Cost savings2) New product launches3) Areas for growth within document outsourcing1) Cost SavingsThe company aims to find productivity gains and cost savings of $1.5B over the next 3 years, which is quite substantial for a company that trades for approximately $7.3B.2) Product launchesIn 2017, the company will have the biggest product launch in its history. It will enhance its connected office portfolio with apps, on-the-go print capabilities and cloud-connectivity. Launching 29 new A3 and A4 products. The company hopes this will ignite revenue in the second half of 2017 and beyond.3) Renewed focus on growth marketsThe new Xerox will focus on digital technology, software and services. The company will invest in areas of strength and growth such as document outsourcing and color production, with a particular emphasis on medium-sized companies. Xerox will shift away from declining markets and towards growing markets. Xerox believes that printing services could have growth opportunities ranging from low single digits to double digits. Which is interesting, because last week when I was reviewing a potential investment in Office Depot (NASDAQ:ODP), its management stated,Office Depot is moving away from selling consumer and business supplies and focusing more on copy and printing services. It believes there is a growth market in printing services to small and medium businesses. Office Depot's competitor, Staples (NASDAQ:SPLS) which I considered as a potential investment opportunity, saidThe fact that these three companies have recently opted to target the same market leads me to believe that there is in fact a growth opportunity there. Critics could argue, and rightly so, that there will be intense competition in print. But there is competition in many markets. At the price that Xerox currently trades at, there is no growth being priced in. The company has guided investors to $0.80 to $0.88 in adjusted EPS for 2017, which means the stock currently trades at less than 9x forward P/E versus the SP500 on a forward P/E of 18x or half of the SP500. A valuation I find attractive.Unfunded pension and health liabilitiesThis is certainly a thorn in my bull thesis. The nearly $3B in unfunded pension and health liabilities. That is a significant cash drag that will materially drag down Xerox's free cash flow for the foreseeable future. But as I have already alluded to, at the price that Xerox trades at that is already accounted for. If the company is able to prove to investors that there is revenue growth at Xerox, it will not be its pension and health liabilities that will stand in the way of new investors investing in Xerox. Also, the company has stated that it will pay down $350m in pension contributions in 2017, cutting down that thorn a little.Additionally, Xerox has guided that it will finish 2017 with pro forma core debt (excluding its financing debt) of $1.6 billion and a cash balance of $1.4 billion, after retiring $1B of debt that matures in 2017 Q1, as well as, paying down an incremental $300m of debt through 2017.ConclusionThis investment will not be a home run investment. It is an activist stock that is being played by one of the greatest activist investors of all time. The sole purpose of Icahn's involvement will be to make the company look great and as soon as that happens, he will be out of the stock (in my opinion). The company's renewed focus will generate somewhere between $525m-$725m in free cash flow for 2017 and its market cap currently trades for less than 13 times the mid free cash flow guidance.This article is not a recommendation to purchase shares of any of the securities mentioned.

When I initiated coverage on I concluded that the stock wasn't dead. This once-stellar blue chip has certainly fallen from grace, big time. It has been struggling for a long time. I suggested on nice dips you could buy simply for the yield and collect the dividend, but growth was nowhere to be found. The name has been searching to regain its footing following the completion of the split of Conduent. The newly created company is essentially Xerox's former business process services segment. The newly leaner Xerox is focusing on the document technology side of things. This move was a value creator, but it was not enough to help the stock regain serious momentum. In fact, the name underwent a 1-for-4 reverse split, and as many of you know I consider these the kiss of death. Perhaps Xerox will be one of the few lucky names that rebounds in the months following a split. The good news is that the stock is now at year-to-date highs. Are better days ahead? Let's check in on the name to see where we are at.The truth is that performance had been rather pathetic of late and is the reason shares had declined quarter after quarter, year after year. It simply was not delivering results, but the dividend kept on being paid and so when the yield got higher, value hunters would step in. But now after the restructuring and a reverse split, we have got to start seeing some growth. Well, here in Q2, we still see declining revenues. Revenue as a whole came in at $2.57 billion, and this missed estimates by $40 million. However, this was also down 7.9% year-over-year, continuing a string of declining quarters. In addition, the degree of declining revenues seems to be picking up steam. That is a problem. However, as I have discussed in-depth in other articles, the strong dollar has hurt companies with international businesses.Because of this issue we, we need to look at revenues on a constant dollar basis. Doing so, we still see revenues were down 6% year over year. That is still a huge negative. While sales were a bit light, margins and cash flows were both strong positives in the quarter. I was pleased to see that adjusted operating margin improved this quarter to 13.3%, while gross margins were a solid 40.7%. Both rose, increasing 0.4 points and 0.5 points respectively. Declining revenue is of course not a positive, but margin improvement is strong. So that means expenses must be under control and they were, as total costs and expenses fell to $2.3 billion from $2.6 billion.In terms of cash flow, Xerox produced $343 million from operations during the second quarter, up substantially from $84 million last year. The company ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.25 billion. Considering revenues and expenses, the company saw earnings of $0.63 per share. Now, we need to factor in some items and in doing so, we see that adjusted earnings came in at $0.87 per share. This actually beat estimates by $0.07.The bottom line? Sales continue to be disappointing but there were some strong positives here. An earnings beat is always great. Margins widened and cash flows were strong. What is keeping a lid on shares then? The company narrowed guidance. It sees earnings per share of $1.84 to $2.08 and adjusted earnings of $3.20 to $3.44 for the year. Still Xerox will generate operating cash flow from continuing operations of $700 to $900 million and free cash flow from continuing operations of $525 to $725 million in 2017. I think with the movement of shares higher, in tandem with the 3.25% yield, the name is a speculative buy.Quad 7 Capital has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

Panic. A 27% hair cut? What is going on? Listen, when I initiated coverage on Xerox (NYSE:XRX), I concluded that the stock wasn't dead, and a year ago, I opined the name was also not ""dead money."" That is important to reiterate. But this once-stellar blue chip has certainly fallen from grace, big time. I then told you that the company was ""not dead yet."" But friends, are we approaching the death of Xerox? I mean, it has been struggling for a long time. However, today's drop comes because the spinoff and separation that I have discussed is finally complete. Today, the company successfully split into two publicly traded companies, one being Xerox, and the other being Conduent Inc. (NASDAQ:CNDT). The massive drop in the stock is reflective of this.Let us discuss the split and the most recent earnings which should help understand where the two companies are coming from. First, Under the terms of the separation, Xerox shareholders received one share of Conduent common stock for every five shares of Xerox common stock they held as of the close of business on Dec. 15, 2016, the record date for the distribution. I will also point out that Xerox received a cash transfer from Conduent of $1.8 billion, which it intends to use, along with cash on hand, to retire approximately $2.0 billion in debt. The newly created company, Conduent, is essentially Xerox's former business process services segment. Conduent will operate in three segments, healthcare, public sector services and commercial industries, with commercial industries making up nearly half of revenues. Now that the companies are split, let's look to see how they were performing.The truth is that performance has been pitiful prior to this split and is the reason Xerox shares have declined months before the split. The recently reported Q3 shows that there were still declining revenues. Revenue as a whole came in at $4.21 billion, and this missed estimates by $100 million. However, this was also down 5.4% year over year, continuing a string of declining quarters. In addition, the degree of declining revenues was picking up steam. On a constant dollar basis, revenues were down 4% year over year. That is still a huge negative. Revenue from the company's ""services"" business was $2.4 billion, which was actually up 1% (but down 2% in constant dollars) with margins at 9.2%.Where the weakness continues is the ""document technology"" business, where the newly leaner Xerox will focus. Here revenue came in at $1.6 billion, down 9% on an absolute basis or 7% in constant dollars. Margins, however, did improve thanks to cost reductions and productivity improvements. They came in down 0.8 percentage points versus last year, but up 0.5 percentage points from the sequential quarter, at 13.1%.Where I think both new companies will benefit from the split is in their costs and expenses. Back in Q3, total costs were down 10% year over year. That is a positive. Adjusted gross margin and selling, administrative and general expenses were 31.0% and 19.6% of revenue, respectively. The bottom line? I'm very much looking forward to the new performance of each company following this separation and split-up of the company. Anyone following this name is keenly aware that Xerox desperately needed a catalyst. It was on life support compared to its once-great status. I continue to be concerned with declining revenues, and although margins widened, they have been pressured heavily this year. However, with the split, both new companies can receive the attention they deserve.Note from the author: Christopher F. Davis has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

Based on everything discussed in this article, my opinion is still HOLD XRX and BUY on dips.Annual Earnings Per Share (EPS)(Data Source: E*Trade, Table & Chart: Author's Work)2016-2017 EPS estimates are down significantly from 2015 levels and are expected to start growing again in 2018. I do not expect XRX to grow much over the next couple of years. However, for value stocks, the estimates may be acceptable. Dividend history data is provided below to support the value case.Annual Revenue(Data Source: E*Trade, Table & Chart: Author's Work)2016-2019 Annual Revenue estimates are flat to decreasing.

However, there was a payout of $0.075 in Jan. 2017 with Ex-Div Date of Dec. 2016, so I expect similar payouts per quarter for the remainder of 2017 ($0.075*4=$0.310 est).Debt Data(Source: Morningstar Bond Data)Recently, Xerox spun off its Business Process Outsourcing Arm, Conduent (NASDAQ:CNDT), as a separate publicly traded company. Xerox's shareholders received one share of CNDT for every five shares of Xerox. Fractional shares were sold in the open market. The net proceeds from the sale of the resultant fractional shares were paid to Xerox. CNDT paid XRX $1.8 billion as a cash transfer, as a part of the split. XRX plans to use the funds received from CNDT to pay off debt.Sector ETFI chose Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK) to see how the Technology Sector is doing.(Source)XLK (Yearly Chart With Weekly Candlesticks)(Source: E*Trade)The Technology Sector, as indicated in the chart above, is doing well, which should help XRX. The new Trump Administration is proving to be pro-business and pro-UK (think Brexit). Xerox has a lot of exposure in the UK so the ""Trump play"" may be a benefit to the company and help lift XRX earnings in the months and years to come.ConclusionXRX may not be what you would consider a growth stock. Based on the data provided above, it may be a good fit for a value investment. XRX has a low P/E (11.45) and a good dividend yield (2.94%), making it attractive to value investors. XRX has a good history of dividend payouts with the exception of the dividend cut in early 2016. The dividend resumed in the 4th Qtr 2016 and will likely continue into 2017. The Dividend Payout Ratio is 49%, which is safe. Opinion: XRT is a HOLD but BUY on dips when the Slow Stochastic indicator drops to around 40%.(Source: Author's Work)"
4030213,101543,2016-12-13T13:57:09-05:00,Xerox is spinning off its business process services segment.The new company name is Conduent.Post spin-off valuation analysis shows 51% upside.,"Xerox (NYSE: XRX) is spinning off its business process services segment; and in order to receive shares of the spin-off company (Conduent), investors need to be a shareholder of record at the close of business on December 15, 2016. Shareholders of record will receive one share of Conduent common stock for every five shares of Xerox. The distribution is planned to be a tax-free distribution.Xerox stock price has seen a decline over the past year, with revenue growth struggling. The company is viewed as operating in a declining industry where management has not been able to improve the financial metrics of the business. This doesn't mean there isn't value in the company with strategic actions management is taking currently. We will analyze the value post spin-off to get a better understanding of future value.OverviewConduent (spin-off company) provides business process services with a focus on transaction-intensive processing, analytics and automation. The services are basically consulting and outsourced support services. The company has three reportable revenue segments.Source: Form 10Commercial industries segment is its largest segment from a revenue perspective with 44%. Many clients in this segment come from the automotive, retail, manufacturing, financial services and aerospace industries. Total revenue in 2015 was $6.66 billion with 90% being reoccurring. A key factor is the majority of the businesses revenue is reoccurring. Below is a more detailed breakdown of all the services provided by the company.Source: Form 10Competition in these markets for business process services is fierce but large, which is estimated to be at $260 billion overall. It is a big market and Coduent is strategically aligned to grow its market share. Management believes with laser focus it will see 6% growth over the next few years.ValuationSince Conduent has a plethora of services provided, there's not just one ideal competitor it competes against as a comparable. It has multiple competitors within all the different specific services it provides. Below is a comparable analysis of some of the top competitors Conduent competes against in the market.Conduent FCF came in at $300 million for 2015. 2016 free cash flow is expected to be down year- over-year because of one time line items like a $150 million settlement payment. Net income for 2015 was $326 million and the TTM for 2016 is $342 million. On a pro forma basis adjusted EBITDA equals $630 million.FCF appears to be a little low for a capital light services business. I expect it should increase on a comparable basis going forward when Conduent is a standalone company. The average valuation of $5.4 billion appears to be a fair price, especially since the company has had issues with growing its top line over the past couple of years. With a $5.4 market cap that would put the P/E at 15.8x earnings. Fair price could be a little more or a little less, but this gives us a good general idea of what the price should be.The combined valuation post spin-off is what we really need to understand in order to figure out if it is a good purchase before the spin-off record date Dec. 15th.There appears to be a definite value driver for the spin-off with 51% upside for shareholders of record before December 15th. This valuation doesn't even expand the FCF multiple for XRX, which should add an even bigger margin of safety.Capital StructureSource: Investor PresentationConduent expects to have total debt of $1.96 billion and transfer $1.9 billion of it, for the fee of the assets to Xerox. This is pretty typical for a transfer of cash to the parent company.TakeawayWith more strategic focus for both companies it appears to be a no brainer for the spin-off. Also, this should unlock a substantial amount of value post-off. Capital allocation should be superior as a stand alone company and bring improved cost saving plans. It is also worth noting Carl Icahn is a huge shareholder of the company at roughly owning 99 million shares or 10% of the business. He views this spin-off as a value creator and I agree with him (Please see here).To read more research on stock spin-offs, fund holdings, micro-cap companies and special situations please consider following me (by clicking the ""Follow"" button at the top of this article next to my name) to receive notification when I publish research next."

That is important to reiterate. But this once stellar blue chip has certainly fallen from grace, big time. I had in my prior work numerous times that we needed to see some improvement in the underlying metrics before I could get behind the name. Well, in the past three months, the stock has moved sideways to higher, but will there be sustained momentum? That is tough to tell, but with Q2 earnings having just come out, I will discuss the performance and where the company and stock may be heading.We know Carl Icahn has been into this trade and now has a role on the board. Remember prior to this he had been upping his stake and has worked to get some of his own people into management at the company. Remember previously that I also discussed that the company was splitting into two separate companies to generate value. That is planned to occur later this year. Post split, we know that Jeff Jacobson will take the reins, while Ursula Burns will move to Chairman of the Board post-split. The question is, how is each business piece performing now, ahead of this move?Well look, performance had been pitiful of late and is the reason shares have declined. Well here, Q2 shows that there are still declining revenues. Revenue as a whole came in at $4.39 billion, but this did meet estimates. However, this was down 4.4% year over year, continuing a string of declining quarters. Of course, as I have discussed in-depth in other articles, the strong dollar has plagued companies with international businesses.Thus, we need to look at revenues on a constant dollar basis. Doing so, we still see revenues were down 4% year over year. That is still a huge negative. Revenue from the company's ""services"" business was $2.5 billion, which was a decrease of 2% (but down only 1% in constant dollars) with margins at 7.7%. Where the weakness continues is the ""document technology"" business.Here revenue came in at $1.8 billion, down 7% on an absolute basis or 6% in constant dollars. Margins, however, did improve thanks to cost reductions and productivity improvements. They came in up 2.4 points versus last quarter, at 12.6%.So revenues declining are never a good thing, but margin improvement is strong. So that means expenses must be under control. Well total costs and expenses were down 6.6% year over year. Adjusted gross margin and selling, administrative and general expenses were 31.2% and 19.7% of revenue, respectively. Both metrics improved quarter over quarter.In terms of cash flow, Xerox produced $177 million in cash flow from operations during the second quarter, in line with normal seasonality, and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.2 billion. Considering revenues and expenses, the company saw an earnings of $0.15. Now, we need to factor in some items and in doing so, we see that adjusted earnings came in at $0.30 per share. This actually beat estimates by $0.05, and is down from a year ago.The take home? I'm looking forward to the separation and split up of the company, as it desperately needs a catalyst. I continue to be concerned with declining revenues and although margins widened, they have been pressured heavily this year.The company affirmed its full-year guidance for adjusted earnings of $1.10 to $1.20 per share. The company expects full-year GAAP earnings of $0.44 to $0.55 per share. It also expects 2016 cash flow from operations of $950 million to $1.2 billion and free cash flow of $600 to $850 million.I think given the reach of the company and despite the headwinds, should the stock dip to the point where it yields 3.5%, I would be a buyer from a speculative standpoint and income standpoint.Note from the author: Christopher F.

That is important to reiterate. But this once-stellar blue chip has certainly fallen from grace, big time. I then told you that the company was ""not dead yet."" But friends, are we approaching the death of Xerox? I mean, it has been struggling for a long time. I suggested on nice dips you could buy simply for the yield and collect the dividend, but growth was nowhere to be found. I had said in my prior work numerous times that we needed to see some improvement in the underlying metrics before I could get behind the name. Well, in the past three months, the stock has moved sideways to higher, but will there be sustained momentum? That is tough to tell, but the name has been downgraded and the most recent earnings were not great.The truth is that performance has been pitiful of late and is the reason shares have declined. Well here, Q3 shows that there are still declining revenues. Revenue as a whole came in at $4.21 billion, and this missed estimates by $100 million. However, this was also down 5.4% year over year, continuing a string of declining quarters. In addition, the degree of declining revenues seems to be picking up and this is real bad news. Of course, as I have discussed in-depth in other articles, the strong dollar has hurt companies with international businesses.Thus, we need to look at revenues on a constant dollar basis. Doing so, we still see revenues were down 4% year over year. That is still a huge negative. Revenue from the company's ""services"" business was $2.4 billion, which was actually up 1% (but down 2% in constant dollars) with margins at 9.2%.Where the weakness continues is the ""document technology"" business. Here revenue came in at $1.6 billion, down 9% on an absolute basis or 7% in constant dollars. Margins, however, did improve thanks to cost reductions and productivity improvements. They came in down 0.8 percentage points versus last year, but up 0.5 percentage points from the sequential quarter, at 13.1%.So revenues declining is never a good thing, but margin improvement is strong. So that means expenses must be under control, right? Well, total costs and expenses were down 10% year over year. That is a positive. Adjusted gross margin and selling, administrative and general expenses were 31.0% and 19.6% of revenue, respectively. Both metrics improved quarter over quarter.In terms of cash flow, Xerox produced $370 million in cash flow from operations during the third quarter, in line with normal seasonality but was up nicely from the $271 million last year, and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.5 billion. Considering revenues and expenses, the company saw earnings of $0.17 per share. Now, we need to factor in some items and in doing so, we see that adjusted earnings came in at $0.27 per share. This actually met estimates.The bottom line? I'm very much looking forward to the separation and split-up of the company, as Xerox desperately needs a catalyst. It is on life support compared to its once-great status. I continue to be concerned with declining revenues, and although margins widened, they have been pressured heavily this year. More bad news. The company narrowed full-year guidance for adjusted earnings of $1.11 to $1.14 per share from $1.10 to $1.20. The company expects full-year GAAP earnings of $0.45 to $0.48 per share, down from $0.44 to $0.55. It also expects 2016 cash flow from operations of $950 million to $1.2 billion and free cash flow of $600 million to $850 million.This is a gamble right now. When it yields 3.5%, I would be a buyer from a speculative standpoint and income standpoint only. The company may see new life following the separation.Note from the author: Christopher F.

3985977,100856,2016-07-03T05:25:49-04:00,Xerox is a blue chip company that was established in 1906.Product obsolescence has caused the company's fortunes to decline.The upcoming split into two companies will not reverse the decline.,"The Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) was established in 1906. It is a household name (indeed, the word 'xerox' is often used as a synonym for 'photocopy'), and it is a component of the S&P 500 index which currently trades for less than $10 per share with a forward price-earnings ratio of 8.23. It offers a dividend yield of 3.32%, with a sustainable payout ratio of 32.6%.Furthermore, as announced on January 29, 2016, the Connecticut-based firm is poised to split its two businesses into two publicly traded companies: its document technology business will still be known as Xerox Corporation, and its business process outsourcing - or BPO - business will be known as Conduent Incorporated. In 2015, the document technology business generated $11 billion in revenue, while the BPO business generated $7 billion in revenue - an overall figure of $18 billion in revenue for Xerox in 2015. The rationales behind the split are to simplify the organizational structure, ensure that resources are allocated in a more disciplined way, and strengthen the focus of the two businesses going forward to maximize the benefits to shareholders.Given the fact that many blue chip stocks on the market are either overvalued or fully valued at present, a bargain hunter could look at Xerox and, at first glance, like what they see. A company with a long history that is trading cheaply, sporting an attractive dividend yield, and offers the prospect of two stocks for the price of one is an opportunity that seems too good to be true. And therein lies the problem: it is too good to be true.The fundamental issue with Xerox is the same issue that brought down Eastman Kodak (NYSE:KODK), which is product obsolescence. The offices and firms that would have used Xerox products to carry out their day-to-day business activities - printers, scanners, cartridges etc. - have now shifted to online methods of carrying out these activities. This trend will only increase over time, and will only hurt the bottom line of both Xerox and Conduent going forward.Indeed, the trend of revenue decline for Xerox over the last five years is telling. Revenue in 2011 was $22.6 billion, in 2012 it was $22.3 billion. In 2013 revenue fell to $21.4 billion and fell again in 2014 to $19.5 billion. As noted above, revenue in 2015 was $18 billion, and the negative trend does not seem likely to end any time soon, even with the split.It is my view that long-term investors would be wise to ignore Xerox entirely. Its past glory is unlikely to be repeated even with its current plans for a turnaround, and its attractiveness on the market at present seems to be little more than a value trap. It's sad to say, but this looks like a blue chip which has had its day.DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial professional and accept no responsibility for any investment decisions a reader makes.

3849136,33291,2016-01-29T17:59:24-05:00,I initiated coverage on Xerox in the fall of 2015.Several new developments have occurred since I last covered the name and this morning I was asked if this stock was 'dead money.'Q4 earnings are out and I discuss the results and the key metrics that you need to know.,"When I initiated coverage on Xerox (NYSE:XRX) this fall, I stated the following:Source: Flickr.comI concluded that the stock wasn't dead, but recently I was asked if the stock is ""dead money."" Since it had been months since I checked in, I said I would have a look. I assume the prompt from the inquiry stemmed from the just reported quarterly earnings that came out Friday morning. In this article, I discuss the performance. But there have been some developments in the name since I last covered it. Most notable activists are taking a stake.First, we know that Carl Icahn has been upping his stake and will be getting some of his people into management at the company. We learned also that the company will be splitting into two separate companies. Remember in the quote above, I cited the strategic review. This split is a result; it will separate into two independent, publicly traded companies, one focusing on document technology and the other on business process outsourcing. On that note, just how are these two 'new' companies performing now?So turning to performance, which has been pitiful of late and is the reason shares have declined, shows that there are still declining revenues. Revenue as a whole came in at $4.65 billion and missed estimates by $80 million. Further, this was down 7.6% year-over-year. Ouch! Of course, as I have discussed in-depth in other articles, the strong dollar has plagued companies with international business. Thus, we need to look at revenues on a constant dollar basis. Doing so, we still see revenues were down 5% year-over-year. That is still a huge negative. Revenue from the company's ""services"" business was $2.6 billion, down 3%, (flat in constant dollars) with margins at 9.4%. Revenue from the company's ""document technology"" business was $1.9 billion, down 13% on an absolute basis or 10% in constant dollars. Margin's narrowed to 11.8%.So revenues declining are never a good thing, nor are slimming margins. So how about earnings? Well, I can first say that total expenses were well over 90% of revenues and operating margin was pressured. Gross margin was 31.3%, and selling, administrative and general expenses were 19.0% of revenue. Considering revenues and expenses, the company saw an earnings of $0.27. Now, we need to factor in some items and in doing so, we see that adjusted earnings came in at $0.32 per share. This actually beat estimates by $0.04, but is down from a year ago. That said, the company did generate strong cash flow of $878 million.So what to do? Well, I have to be honest here, I'm not happy with declining revenues and pressured margins. I think the company split is a strong way to generate some life for shareholders. The outlook for 2016 is better than I expected. It is looking for GAAP earnings of $0.66 to $0.76, whereas adjusted earnings will be $1.07 to $1.20. Operating cash flow will be $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion and free cash flow will exceed $1 billion. Further, the company announced that its board of directors declared an 11% increase in the company's quarterly cash dividend to $0.0775 per share. So is Xerox dead-money? No, not at all. The yield is well in excess of 3% and I am tempted to be a buyer here.Note from the author: Christopher F. Davis has been a leading contributor with Seeking Alpha since early 2012.

3860196,80285,2016-02-03T09:30:00-05:00,"Icahn has been successful in getting three board seats in the Business Process Outsourcing company, and is involved in the search for a new CEO.
        On a sum-of-the-parts valuation, Xerox's valuation is not attractive enough.
        Of the two separate future companies, the BPO Company is clearly a higher quality business with more potential.
        Document Technology arm could be bought out at a premium by competitors such as HPQ. Otherwise, a tax-free spin-off should create M&A opportunities in the future.
        Although most factors are aligned for value creation, shares are not sufficiently low to generate satisfactory returns. Hence, selling puts may be a superior strategy.","After being bearish on Xerox (NYSE:XRX) for the most part of last year, I signaled that Icahn's involvement could catalyze a reversal for the company, whose shares had fallen nearly 30% before the spike today. With last week's news, we re-evaluate Xerox's prospects going forward.Xerox's Board of Directors (BoD) and management has capitulated by giving Carl Icahn three board seats on the to-be-created BPO company. He has also been allowed to assign an observer/advisor to be involved in the search for a new CEO. This is great news as it means Ursula Burns, Xerox's CEO whom we do not have a favourable opinion of, will not be running the new BPO company. However, upon closer scrutiny we do not believe Xerox's shares have enough value at these levels despite its positive prospects.Carl Icahn In The Driving SeatAccording to the formal agreement signed between Icahn and Xerox's management, the activist investor is getting more than what the press release would suggest. Other than three board seats and an advisor/observer in the search for the new CEO, Icahn also has the power to approve the nomination for another board member, solidifies his control over the board.The composition of the new board is as follows: Icahn will designate three board members and Xerox's current board will select two existing members to join the BoD of the BPO company, with four new independent external directors being nominated by the current board. Icahn has the power to approve the nomination of one of these four new directors. Also, the new CEO, whom Icahn's staff will have an active role in the search and select process, will be among the four new board members.Therefore, Carl Icahn essentially has the power to select/choose five board members (including the CEO), putting him squarely in control of the board. Furthermore, given that only a maximum of two current directors can join the new board, we are confident that the appalling corporate governance seen in Xerox will not continue at the new BPO company. Hence, we think investors should stick with the smart money as long as Icahn remains invested. Furthermore, value-destroying CEO Ursula Burns is likely to stay with the DT company, which should make the BPO company a clear choice out of the two.We note that Icahn first took his positions in late November, before increasing his stake in December. From the regulatory filings, we can derive that his average cost is $10+/share, roughly 11% higher than the current share price. One has to believe that this implies Icahn believes the company could be worth far more on a sum-of-the-parts basis, provided that Xerox is separated into two companies with no major issues.The SplitNow that Xerox has clearly defined the split into two companies, one comprising of the BPO segment and the other comprising of the Document Outsourcing (NYSE:DO) and DT segments. Traditionally, BPO and DO have been reported as a single 'Services' segment in Xerox's disclosures, and hence there is some difficulty determining the value of these businesses as separate entities. However, there are clues and characteristics that can help us derive a close estimation of what they might be worth separately.The Document CompanyThe 'Document Company' will consist of the DT and DO businesses. The DT segment of the company generates a larger amount of cash flow due to Xerox's large installed base of printers which enable them to collect regular fees for maintenance and supplies. Xerox also has an internal financing arm that allows customers to purchase large printing equipment on credit terms. (The receivables are usually securitized and sold off at a discount). The DT segment generated roughly $7.4B in revenue for FY2015 at a segment EBIT margin of 11.8%. The segment has been shrinking for the past couple of years both in terms of revenue and margins.(Source: Author's Work)The DT business is already in run-off mode due to the large number of competitors, alternative printer models and the mature stage of the industry. There is strong competition throughout the supply chain from entry-level printing to high-end printing equipment and services. As a result, revenue has declined significantly but margins are holding fairly steady due to streamlining and cost-cutting initiatives.From FY2014 to FY2015, Revenue declined roughly 12% in actual-currency terms, but the decline was markedly less at 8% in constant-currency. Looking at the trend in past years, we think DT revenue will experience an organic decline of 6% - 8% for the next three to five years, in-line with recent performance, before tapering off at a terminal decline rate of roughly 3% - 5%. Assuming margins remain steady, we would conservatively value the DT segment between 4x and 6x FY2015 EBIT, which would give it a value between $3.51B and $5.27B. I think these assumptions are on the lower end and creates a margin of safety from a bull's perspective.Next, we move on to the Document Outsourcing business. Here it gets a little difficult to derive segment data because DO is reported together with BPO as a single 'Services' segment. However, note that the Services segment was created with the acquisition of ACS in 2009, which added the BPO business to Xerox's overall portfolio. Therefore, we can go back and get a sense of the DO margins before the acquisition.From Xerox's disclosures, it would seem that the BPO business has a far higher margin than DO.(Source: Author's Work)In 2008, DO generated $3.83B in revenue and $302M in operating profit (or EBIT), which means segment margin was 7.9%. In FY2009, DO margins fell to 6.7% due to a steep fall in usage of black-and-white printers and a 2-point hit from currency fluctuations. Since then, the printer mix has shifted significantly to mid and high-end color printers, which should have slowed margin shrinkage. The addition of the BPO business brought the combined Pro-Forma FY2009 Services margin to 10.75%, which means BPO had an EBIT margin of 13.1% on its own in 2009. It's clear at this point that DO has far lower margins than BPO and the latter is clearly the more attractive part of the Services segment. It is no wonder that Icahn had his eyes on the to-be-created BPO company.Given that Services margin has declined slightly since 2009, we assume both businesses have experienced similar magnitudes of margin decline. We also take into account the fact that BPO has grown from comprising 58% of Services revenue in 2009 to 68% of Services revenue in FY2015. Accordingly, with FY2015 Services EBIT margin at 8.1%, we estimate BPO margins to be between 10% - 11% and DO margins to be 4.5% to 5.5%. Taking the mid-point of these margins, the DO business would have generated EBIT of $163M in FY2015. Given that DO revenue has been largely flat in the past couple of years with some slight declines, we assume revenue will decline modestly at 2% - 3% annually for the foreseeable future. In this case, we think the business is appropriately valued at between 7-9x FY2015 EBIT, which gives us a range of $1.14B to $1.47B.The BPO CompanyLastly, we value Xerox's crown jewel: the growing BPO services segment. As per our previous analysis, we take the midpoint of our 10%-11% EBIT margin estimate, which gives us a FY2015 EBIT of $722M. BPO revenue was down 2% in constant-currency but had been showing signs of signs of growth (albeit slowing) in the past few years. The BPO business has benefited from Obamacare legislation requiring hospitals to run more efficiently, and the overall trend towards automating business functions to allow for cost-savings. However, management has done a poor job in terms of project management as there have been significant cost overruns and margin pressures in recent years. Hence, we believe the BPO company has far more potential if motivated and competent management are put in place.Despite management's figure of projected '5%' growth, we feel one should be more conservative when on the long side. We would look at the segment as if revenues remain flat. Hence, we value the BPO business conservatively at 9-11x FY2015 EBIT, which gives us a range of $6.50B to $7.94B.Bringing the three values together, Xerox could be worth an estimated $11.15B to $14.68B. After deducting net debt, we end up with a range of $6.31B to $9.84 which hovers right around Xerox's current share price of ~$9.Where Is Value Created?By now, some readers will have grave questions about my EBIT assumptions, because when added together they exceed Xerox's consolidated EBIT for 2015. This is due to some unallocated costs such as restructuring expenses, amortization of intangible assets, impairments and others. In the end, the numbers I presented do not demonstrate a compelling bull case.The valuation of each segment allows us to understand each business better as we take into account the different factors and their historical figures. More importantly, this shows that based on a set of very conservative assumptions, the numbers do not work from a bullish perspective, and that there isn't sufficient upside from the current share price. Note however, that we have derived this numbers without taking into account the improvements that will likely happen with a motivated and competent management, which we think Icahn will surely put in place. Therefore, any incremental improvements should be directly accretive to the value of the BPO Company. In other words, the 'math' does not check out.However, one needs to take into account the qualitative variables. Most of the time, making or losing money comes down to an analysis of factors and how each one is likely to play out. Particularly in Xerox's case, there are a number of variables that are crucial to the bull case.Firstly, the new management of the BPO Company will need to implement structural changes to undo previous mistakes. Xerox's BPO business has a large backlog with $11.5B in total contract value (TCV) signings this year alone. The ability to monetize these projects at a higher margin will be the key to Xerox's performance. In this case, Icahn is a motivated owner and we should see a competent CEO installed and given the appropriate incentives. Moreover, with Icahn having control over the board, corporate governance should be strong and the sort of 'paying for inferior performance' at Xerox should disappear.Also, we await the release of more detailed segment disclosures that should allow for us to estimate the value of each company more accurately. The margins and cash flows are particularly important, although we may not get an accurate estimate of Pro-Forma cash flows until after the separation. Also, with the BPO contract renewal rate falling significantly to 74% this quarter, investors should be concerned if this indicates a deterioration in the business. We are being told that the lower renewal rate was due to a large contract coming due and that it was uneconomical to renew at the asking terms. I think this explanation is sufficient for now, but would be gravely concerned if the renewal rate does not recover to above 85% next quarter.Next, the Document Company is likely to receive M&A offers either in the lead-up or after spin-off, which should enhance shareholder returns. With margins in Managed Print Services and related areas shrinking, competitors are eager to consolidate to cut costs and take advantage of scale. To that end, we think the Document Company could be a good fit for HPQ given the overlap in printer manufacturing and commercial print services. The global footprint of both companies also allow HPQ to consolidate and enlarge their reach with a larger customer base whilst eliminating duplicate corporate functions to cut costs.The last and perhaps most important factor is how the company's liabilities and cash will be split. I mentioned in previous articles that Xerox has an unfunded pension and health liability of $3.3B - how that is dividend among the two companies will be crucial. The same logic goes for Xerox's $6.4B in debt. However, if Icahn loves his money, which we think he does, the BPO company is not likely to be burdened with too many liabilities as the veteran is no stranger to winning behind-the-scenes negotiations. However, one can never be too certain and we will have to monitor proceedings closely.ConclusionOverall, Xerox remains in decent shape for now as the company continues to generate ~$1.2B in free cash flow annually. However, it is clear that a tremendous amount of cash has been wasted by management on unaccretive acquisitions in the past few years, whilst continuing to pay themselves huge bonuses even overall performance deteriorated significantly.Prior to Icahn's involvement, some readers on SeekingAlpha had prophetically commented that Xerox was ripe for activist intervention, and it is certainly happening in full force now. However, we would caution against excess optimism - the market was initially optimistic before turning extremely bearish on Xerox's share price, implying that the marginal investor does not believe in the turnaround story yet. The facts are that Q4 bought about good news with Icahn's involvement, but also a continued fundamental deterioration - Xerox experienced falling BPO renewal rates, free cash flow and year-on-year margin declines.To sum it all up, we think Xerox's future prospects are positive but the current share price does not present sufficient upside. However, we would be a buyer at 8 or less. Given Xerox's high implied volatility percentage currently, we think Jan 2017 puts with a strike price of $8 are the best instrument to express this view. The puts are currently trading for $75 per option, which means the break-even point excluding commission is $7.25/share. It essentially allows one to buy Xerox shares at $7.25 for a small collateral amount, and a bonus of earning the entire premium if Xerox's share price stays above $8."
4007005,69295,2016-09-19T08:21:39-04:00,Company over depreciates intangible and tangible assets hiding the free cash flow capabilities of this capital-lite business.Leverage at face value overstates debt burden since most of the debt finances receivables from completed contract work from a diversified customer base.Spinoff will give the BPO business a much better corporate and incentive structure to become more efficient and potentially grow its business.,"Xerox (NYSE:XRX) is a company that is labeled by the public as a ""has-been."" Having first experienced tremendous success after its introduction of the first copying machines, the business hasn't been able to make new waves with newer products and is generally lumped in with companies like Kodak (NYSE:KODK).This comparison is patently untrue as Xerox has changed from a capital intensive manufacturer to a capital-lite business services corporation. The misunderstandings about the company are manifold but the main ones I want to highlight are as follows.1. Xerox's depreciation of both tangible and intangible assets are grossly overstated as to the real cost of their actual expended depreciation2. Xerox is much less leveraged than what's seen superficially on the balance sheet with $7.5 BN in debtFinancial analysisWith roughly $2.1BN in EBITDA in 2015 as calculated below and just over $2.0BN in the last twelve months of second quarter 2016, Xerox's enterprise value is just under 8 times. This number means nothing by itself. However, interest expenses are very small at under 5% of the principal debt amount. This leaves tremendous free cash for equity holders to use to maintain any capital assets. Roughly, $1.65BN for LTM Q2 2016.Of this amount, according to Xerox's GAAP accounting disclosures, $1.2BN had to go towards the amortization of tangibles and intangibles. These are huge expenses that don't necessarily equate into cash spending or even true depreciation for that matter.Source: Author's own workSource: Author's own workTaking a look at the past 3 years results for Xerox, total payouts equated to roughly $4.35BN through dividends and equity buybacks. If we net out the proceeds from the sale of their businesses including their ITO business, Xerox has paid out a total of $3.36BN in cash to shareholders and at the same time actually decreased their net debt position by roughly $1.24BN.What this tells me is that rather than spending their cash on capital investments, the company has the ability to pay out very large amounts of free cash. Net capital expenditures from 2013 until 2015 averaged roughly $564 million. This number includes acquisitions which includes intangible elements as well. While this is less than half the average $1.22BN the company used for total depreciation in the same period, it is also significantly less than the 3-year average tangible depreciation of $908 million by $344 million per annum.This is a very large disparity between expended depreciation and the accounting depreciation Xerox uses. I think the graphics shown below in conjunction with the explanation given is very strong evidence that the disclosed depreciation, both tangible and intangible does not represent the economic reality of the business.Source: Author's own workSource: Author's own workSource: Author's own workThe vast majority of their business, 85% in 2015, was from selling products and services that came under the form of a long-term contract or annuity. It's difficult to have a customer pay for expensive equipment upfront, so Xerox offers them a long-term contract which includes a supply and service contract that's paid over a longer period. In essence, Xerox finances their customers as an off balance sheet liability with its own low cost borrowing. The company's 10-K states the following.What this means is that of the total $7.4BN in total debt principal, $3.9BN of it, or over 50%, is backed by customer receivables earning both financing (interest) revenues as well as the gross margin of the underlying business. Using cheap unsecured debt to finance customer receivables is an unorthodox financing method, but this would imply that we have a notional corporate debt level of only $3.4BN if we net out the financing debt.The major portion of their customer counterparties are also investment grade, which along with the diversified customer base, makes the debt backed by these receivables very safe.Qualitative analysisThe central question for the Xerox investment thesis lies in how well their tremendous EBITDA less interest expense can translate into free cash flow for equity investors. Since the majority of their business is in services and requires relatively small capital investments, and the fact that the company has paid out most of their EBITDA beyond interest expenses in the past, it's highly likely that there is a dearth of profitable capital investments available for the company.However, Xerox is experiencing a shrinkage of revenues which may imply that capital investments or acquisitions are needed to maintain and grow business. It may also, of course, imply that the businesses are poorly managed and operate under a badly incentivized corporate structure; a problem that no amount of investment or acquisition will fix.To address the point of declining revenues, yes, it's arguable that Xerox's equipment offering is experiencing a decline in demand that is perhaps secular or cyclical in nature or maybe both. However, the BPO business segment could arguably be a growing business but has been performing poorly under Xerox management.The BPO business, to be named ""Conduent"" after the spinoff, will not only have a separate brand name to operate under, but will also have important structural and strategic advantages that were previously conflicted and inefficient under Xerox management. I can't say it anymore eloquently myself so I will just quote them directly below from the SEC filing.There is no guarantee that these changes will alter the future projection of revenues. The spinoff only promises that a best attempt will be made to correct what was an obvious deficiency in the incentive structure of two unique businesses.It also allows interested investors to have a say in the separate businesses themselves without having to go through the board and the CEO making them much more flexible and adaptable entities. This in and of itself should be enough to raise the combined value of the two entities beyond what the market gave them while they were under the same roof.ConclusionXerox is a misunderstood situation in terms of their financials as well as their underlying businesses. While certain investors may be aware of the underlying value in the stock after very close analysis, the market chooses to price the company well below its potential value. The spinoff will begin to help the market recognize the value of the company and the discipline instilled from a successful separation will aid in the capital allocation process of the two unique businesses.Revenue declines are the main focus for the company. However, my opinion is that at least for the BPO business, poor performance has been largely the deficient corporate structure rather than gross capital misallocation. By separating the BPO business into the separate name Conduent addresses both of these issues.The exact terms of the spinoff have not been announced, but I do not think the terms of debt burden will heavily favor one business versus the other and that both companies will be given equal treatment in their ability to thrive and grow organically."
3716766,41741,2015-11-27T11:47:18-05:00,What's Carl Icahn doing in a copier company.He owns 7.1% and is the second largest shareholder.A buyout is the company's best bet.,"Billionaire Carl Icahn has become the second largest shareholder for one of the world's biggest document services providers. Icahn has a 7.13 percent stake in Xerox (NYSE:XRX) and plans to discuss the business's short- and long-term future with the board, according to a regulatory filing.Icahn believes Xerox shares are undervalued, and his point appears to be valid. Question is, is this old tech company a value trap?Xerox's stock price has fallen from close to $14 at the end of last year to close to $9 at the beginning of this month. Xerox CEO Ursula Burns has noted that her company's management and board will ""consider a range of opportunities regarding our businesses and operations with the goal of maximizing value for shareholders.""Can Icahn bring Xerox into the digital age?Xerox is an old tech company stuck in the past - it's a printer company that has managed limited growth over the last few years, particularly as many businesses have embraced the cloud and other digital technologies.For example, Xerox's total adjusted revenue hit $4.4 billion in the third quarter of this year, down 4 percent in constant currency. Also, revenue from Xerox's document technology sector fell to $1.8 billion in Q3 2015, which represented a 12 percent decline.Xerox is in the midst of a leadership transition as well, which further complicates the pivot/turnaround.Kathryn Mikells, Xerox's chief financial officer since May 2013, stepped down from her role with the company in October. Longtime Xerox executive Leslie Varon currently serves as interim CFO, and Icahn could influence Xerox's decision-making process as its leaders search for a permanent CFO.""[Icahn] may have input in the selection of the new CFO of the company, given his background in advising companies across various industries,"" Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note.Will Xerox go the HP route?To better understand where Xerox goes from here, the recent moves of Hewlett-Packard may provide a guideline for Xerox to follow, especially now that the printer company has Icahn's support.In Oct. 2014, HP announced plans to split its PCs and printers business from its enterprise hardware and services business. The move would create two companies that would help HP ""accelerate performance, drive sustained growth and demonstrate clear industry leadership in key areas,"" according to the company.""The decision to separate into two market-leading companies underscores our commitment to the turnaround plan. It will provide each new company with the independence, focus, financial resources, and flexibility they need to adapt quickly to market and customer dynamics, while generating long-term value for shareholders,"" HP CEO Meg Whitman said at that time.Despite this commitment to boost its value for shareholders, HP's revenue fell in four consecutive quarters following its announcement. In addition, several analysts indicated that HP was struggling to adapt to mobile and online computing, which may has stifled the company's growth.HP officially divided into two Fortune 500 companies -- HP (NYSE:HPQ) and Hewlett-Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) this month. With the move, HP focuses on selling printers and PCs, while its enterprise business offers servers, software, storage and networking.A similar move could be on the horizon for Xerox, and Icahn's involvement with the company raises the likelihood of a split or outright sale of the business. Icahn has a history of leading the push for spinning off separate companies as well.Icahn just got a win at eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), where it spun off PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), its payment division. Note that in 3Q, Icahn sold all of his eBay stake, while holding onto PayPal shares. .Activist Icahn is also urging insurance giant American International Group (NYSE:AIG) to divide its company into three separate businesses. He's contended that AIG is ""too big to succeed"" and separating the company into life, property and casualty & mortgage insurance divisions could bolster the company's stock value.Bottom lineIcahn's ownership stake in Xerox certainly raises questions about the business' plans going forward. And regardless of whether Xerox splits, sells off its assets or maintains its current operations, Icahn's involvement ensures the company now offers stronger growth potential for investors."
3967743,33291,2016-04-25T12:58:38-04:00,"Last fall when I initiated coverage on Xerox, I concluded that the stock wasn't dead, and in January I opined the name was also not dead money.The company is planning to split into two separate companies to shore up fledgling performance.Q1 earnings are out and I take a look at the declining performance.","Last fall when I initiated coverage on Xerox (NYSE:XRX), I concluded that the stock wasn't dead, and in January I opined the name was also not ""dead money."" I had said numerous times that we needed to see some improvement in the underlying metrics before I could get behind the name. Well, in the past three months the stock has moved higher nicely, rising well over 10%. Now Q1 earnings are out and in this article, I will discuss the performance.First, with the stock up over 10% maybe I should start following Carl Icahn into some trades, as he had been upping his stake and has worked to get some of his people into management at the company. Now, it is not just Icahn that caused the stock to rebound. Remember when I covered the company last, I discussed that the company was splitting into two separate companies to generate value. That is planned to occur later this year. The question is, how is each business piece performing now, ahead of this move?Well look, performance had been pitiful of late and is the reason shares have declined. Well here, Q1 shows that there are still declining revenues. Revenue as a whole came in at $4.28 billion, but this did beat estimates by $80 million. However, this was down 4% year-over-year, continuing a string of declining quarters. Of course, as I have discussed in-depth in other articles, the strong dollar has plagued companies with international business. Thus, we need to look at revenues on a constant dollar basis. Doing so, we still see revenues were down 3% year-over-year. That is still a huge negative. Revenue from the company's ""services"" business was $2.5 billion, which was an increase of 1%, (but up 2% in constant dollars) with margins at 7.7%. Where the weakness continues is the ""document technology"" business. Here revenue came in at $1.6 billion, down 10% on an absolute basis or 9% in constant dollars. Margins narrowed to 10.2%.So revenues declining are never a good thing, nor are slimming margins. So how about earnings? Well, expenses as a percent of revenue rose year-over-year and as such first-quarter operating margin narrowed to 7.2%, was down 1.3 percentage points from the same quarter a year ago. Adjusted gross margin and selling, administrative and general expenses were 30.3% and 20.1%, respectively. In terms of cash flow, Xerox used $25 million in cash flow from operations during the first quarter, in line with normal seasonality, and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $1.2 billion. Considering revenues and expenses, the company saw an earnings of $0.03. Now, we need to factor in some items and in doing so, we see that adjusted earnings came in at $0.22 per share. This actually missed estimates by $0.01, and is down from a year ago.I continue to be concerned with declining revenues and pressured margins. I think the company split is a strong way to generate some life for shareholders. The outlook for Q2 2016 is in line with what I expected. It is looking for GAAP earnings of $0.06 to $0.08, whereas adjusted earnings will be $0.24 to $0.26. The company affirmed its full-year guidance for adjusted earnings of $1.10 to $1.20 per share, but lowered GAAP earnings and cash flow guidance to reflect separation costs and higher restructuring and related costs. The company now expects full-year GAAP earnings of $0.44 to $0.55 per share, down from $0.66 to $0.76 per share. Xerox expects 2016 cash flow from operations of $950 million to $1.2 billion, down from $1.3 to $1.5 billion, and free cash flow of $600 to $850 million, previously $1.0 to $1.2 billion. This weakened outlook reflects the cost of splitting the business. I am rooting for the company, but after the recent rise in the stock, I am not a buyer. Should the stock dip to the point where it yields 3.5% (and the fundamentals are in good shape) I will revisit this stance.Note from the author: Christopher F.

3768986,60741,2015-12-22T13:31:21-05:00,"Xerox will not be the same company going into 2017 as it is going into 2016.With Carl Icahn taking an activist position, and management disclosing that it is evaluating strategic alternatives, a transformation through resource conversion is inevitable.This can by lucrative for outside passive minority investors, but only at the right price and the right timing. I hereby provide a playbook.","Xerox (NYSE:XRX) will not be the same company going into 2017 as it is going into 2016. With both management publicly declaring that it is reviewing strategic alternatives, and with Carl Icahn taking an activist position, now owning 8.1% of the company, Xerox is on the verge of change. The changes ahead may be lucrative to the Outside Passive Minority Investor (OPMI, a Martin Whitman's definition), not just to the Carl Icahns of the world. Nevertheless, timing and valuation are critical for playing this name. In this article I shall describe the situation and provide a playbook.Xerox Corporation - Not What You ThinkXerox was once the most promising innovative technology company in the world. Having invented the plain paper photocopier, the PC mouse and Windows-like graphical user interface, laser printing, WYSIWYG text editors and Ethernet, it is a tragedy that Xerox did not exploit its huge potential and became a tech giant. Instead, Xerox today is only a $10 billion market cap company manufacturing and selling photocopiers, and providing business process and document management services. Examples of some of the company's services include: Transaction Processing Services - Xerox manages processes such as insurance claims, debit card swipes, benefits distribution and payroll; Managed Print Services and Centralized Print Services; Legal and e-Discovery Services - Xerox helps corporations and law firms manage volumes of electronic data more efficiently by using in-house imaging and analytics capabilities; Finance, Accounting and Payment Services.Xerox reports in two segments: Its printer/photocopier business is reported in Document Technology segment, and the business processes in the Services segment. Doc Tech segment is experiencing a secular decline, yet Xerox continues milking it for high contribution margins, as can be seen in the table below.(source: 2014 10-K)Xerox's board of directors and executive management is anything but shareholder friendly. For starters, CEO Ursula Burns' compensation is a source for concern. An excellent Reuters article portrays how half of CEO Ursula Burns' 2014 annual bonus target was predicated on hitting an EPS level. Ultimately, she received a bonus of $1.98 million out of a possible $2.2 million, boosting her total 2014 compensation to $22M. As Chairman and CEO she approved $1.1B stock repurchases in 2014, certainly helping her to reach the threshold EPS level, enabling her hefty bonus. Using stock repurchases to boost executive pay is becoming a common practice, albeit disputed.In addition, Xerox disclosures are not straightforward, raising concerns on the candidness of management. Xerox is taking the concept of EBBS (Earnings Before Bad Stuff) to an extreme, reporting Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and even Adjusted EPS. Financial results seem so much better when you don't use GAAP, and thus don't account for currency headwinds, write downs, restructuring, discontinued operations and other bad stuff. Xerox's SEC filings are not easy to understand, at least to the author. For example, Xerox sells some of its finance receivables as a means to finance its working capital, which complicates the understanding of debt. Another source of complication is the off-balance-sheet arrangements, significant contingent liabilities, large defined-benefit pension liabilities ($2,493M pension and other benefit liabilities), and the accounting involved due to its numerous acquisitions. In such big and convoluted companies, there's just so much room for management to manipulate earnings (not that I'm claiming that Xerox did), that without tangible evidence for management candidness and shareholder friendliness, an investor is better being wary by default.Moreover, Xerox issued $345M worth of Class A preferred shares with liquidation preference, probably as a shark repellent (aka poison pill) to ward off activists, or at least make their activist campaign a bit more complicated (not that it affected Carl Icahn). Ms. Burns serves both as CEO and Chairman of the board, a practice which should be viewed with caution, especially for such a veteran and relatively large company. Finally, I'm concerned that all directors except Ms. Burns own only a minuscule amount of the company's common stock (beyond their deferred stock units compensation), albeit some have been serving on this board for many years.My concerns over corporate governance receive some support from the not-so-good ISS quickscore of 6, indicating higher corporate governance risk than average.To conclude the discussion on management and directors, prospective investors may find the discussions in the comment section of this Seeking Alpha article interesting. A commentator familiar with CFO Kathy Mikells, who recently stepped down, attests to her honesty and competence, in response to other commentators' concerns over management shareholder friendliness.Xerox in 2016 - Going To Get InterestingMartin Whitman, the founder and CIO of Third Avenue Management, co-wrote a wonderful book with Fernando Diz, Modern Security Analysis, which every serious investor should read, sooner rather than later. One of the main theses of this book is that companies should not be viewed merely as going concerns, as the co-authors claim Graham and Dodd do, as well as academicians. Rather, stocks often appreciate as their underlying companies go through resource conversion activities, which often unlock the valuation differences between public market prices and private market prices. Whitman and Diz present a deep and important thesis which is key to understanding situations such as that of Xerox. Their approach is summarized in the following excerpt:The ball started rolling on Xerox's path to resource conversion. CEO Ursula Burns announced in her Q3'15 earnings release that ""Xerox's Board of Directors and management team continually review the company's strategy and consider a range of opportunities regarding our businesses and operations with the goal of maximizing value for shareholders. Although we already have taken steps to accelerate cost reductions and prioritize investments to drive improved productivity and higher margins, our Board determined that undertaking a comprehensive review of structural options for the company's portfolio is the right decision at this time.""Speculation is on that Xerox may break up into two companies, one centered on its Document Technology Hardware and Software (Printers and Photocopiers), and the other one on Business Process Services. It may shop for buyers for one or both those businesses. Xerox may consider going private, merging into a larger conglomerate as a whole, or re-capitalize its capital structure.A month after CEO Burns' announcement, Carl Icahn disclosed a 7% stake (now 8.1%) through a SC 13D filing. Why did Mr. Icahn initiate an activist campaign after the CEO and Chairman publicly declared that unlocking shareholder value was her top priority, and all strategic alternatives are on the table? Icahn could have sufficed with having a passive stake, watching the company transform. Well, I suspect that Mr. Icahn sees the same corporate governance concerns which I described above, and thus seeks a change in the board, as well as to executive management. While this is only a speculation, I would not be surprised if Ms. Burns issued her statement because she knew that Carl Icahn was planning an activist campaign, wishing to ward him off. After all, Ms. Burns admitted during the Q3'15 conference call that the board was considering strategic alternatives for a while, but only now decided to make it public. If that was indeed Ms. Burns' intention, it surely did not help. In any case, the ball started rolling on Xerox's transformation.Resource Conversion - How Xerox May ChangeXerox's last reported equity value is $9,113M, with goodwill amounting to $8,839M, and in addition, intangibles reaching $1,840M. The high level of intangibles is not surprising, considering that Xerox spends hundreds of millions each year on acquisitions, mostly of service businesses.Let's look at some of Xerox's latest acquisitions:In total, Xerox paid $276M for 2012 acquisitions, which contributed the same amount in revenues in subsequent years 2013 and 2014. Xerox paid $155M for 2013 acquisitions, which contributed only a little more than half that amount, $84M in full year 2014. Xerox paid $338M for 2014 acquisitions, which according to my rough estimate will contribute $260M to 2015 revenues on a pro-forma full year basis.Xerox also sold its Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) business for $940M, and recorded a net pre-tax loss of $181, reflecting the write-down of carrying value.The data indicates that Xerox paid between 1x and 2x EV/Revenues for its acquisitions. Synergies may result in increasing revenue and profitability, but if there is such a potential, it is yet to be proven. Under capable management, those businesses, some of which seem like a good fit to Xerox's overall services offering may provide opportunities for providing a fuller services offering and provide cross-selling opportunities in the diverse geographies in which Xerox operates. Thus, a more aggressive use of those acquired assets, as well the existing assets, is a potential catalyst. Maybe this is what Carl Icahn sees as well, and that's why he says that Xerox is cheap.ValuationThe Document Technology segment, responsible for selling and leasing printers and photocopiers, brought in $8,044M, $8,500M, $8951M of revenues in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. It is declining sharply and may end 2015 with only $6,500M of revenues. I wouldn't pay more than 0.3x EV/Sales for it, resulting in $2,000M Enterprise Value valuation. This would be about 2x its expected operating profit contribution, which seems to fit its declining business status.The services segments brings in about $10,000M in annual revenues, a steady figure for the past three fiscal years, and expected to change little for 2015. Competitor companies in the business operations services industry (mostly more successful businesses than Xerox) are selling for EV/Sales multiples of 0.9x to 2.7x, as seen from the comparison below.(source: stockrover.com)At 0.9x its services revenues, and adding $2B for the document technology segment, Xerox may be worth $11B EV, 30% less than today's EV of $16B. But if management does a good job in integrating the newly acquired purchases, exploiting synergies and growing revenues by a mere 5% in the next three years, it may bring $11.5M in revenue in 2018 and be valued at, say, 2x EV/Sales. This would result in $25B EV (including $2B for the Doc Tech business), equaling to about $19 a share, an appreciation of about 90% compared to today's $10 share price. With competent management, strategic creativity when designing resource conversion actions (breakup, divestitures, additional acquisitions, debt refinancing or recapitalization), and with the help of market tailwinds and a bit of luck, $25-$30 a share is possible.The PlaybookThe key to success is a shakeup in the board of directors and executive management. Given the concerns over corporate governance practices, I would not recommend jumping in just yet. I have learned the hard (and costly) way that once a new CEO assumes control and had sufficient time to learn the business, often the dirty laundry comes out, resulting in more bad news, write downs and disappointments. Such was the situation in my Arctic Cat (NASDAQ:ACAT) and Spark Networks (NYSEMKT:LOV) investments, among others. Such may be the situation for Xerox, should Carl Icahn, or any other activists, succeed in their (speculated) plan to replace management.With Carl Icahn initiating an activist campaign on Xerox, the catalyst of value creation through resource conversion becomes a real possibility. Nevertheless, I would recommend standing on the sidelines until there is additional tangible evidence that a transformation is on its way, and until one of the two occurs:In any case, the story will be interesting to watch."
3710826,80285,2015-11-24T14:35:42-05:00,"Xerox has good assets but poor management.Icahn's stake could lead to a management shake-up, which can create significant value for shareholders.Icahn is likely to get shareholder support from a base of disgruntled retail investors who have seen returns diminish over the years.Although there is no quick fix for Xerox's ailing business, there are steps that could be taken in the near term to unlock value.If Icahn manages to get board seats and brings in competent management, Xerox's share price could have material long-term upside.","Since we initiated coverage with Xerox (NYSE:XRX) by labeling the company as a value trap, there has been significant downside as many bearish factors have materialized, including margin compression in the services segment and lower free cash flows due to underperformance amidst a transition into a services-based company. A large part of the bull case has been against management as Xerox has a broken incentive model that pays executives well for underperformance. The targets are set so low that management would get large stock bonuses by simply guiding the company to a slow decline.Why Carl Icahn's Involvement Changes ThingsXerox is a company with bad management but good assets. It has a large presence in government healthcare projects and business process outsourcing. Furthermore, it still possesses a lucrative printer manufacturing business that provides decent free cash flow to the company.However, the problem has been a lack of general direction and weak execution when it comes to large projects. In our previous article, we wrote that multiple cost-overruns and lower-than-expected margins were a crucial issue because it signaled poor planning by executives in terms of ensuring project profitability in the context of a fixed budget.Given Carl Icahn's penchant for a management shake-up, we believe this could be the first step to a reversal of Xerox's decline. The CEO has certainly not been earning her paycheck of nearly $18M last year, which was her biggest payday since joining Xerox. In contrast, the company's free cash flows continued to decline. An overhaul of the current management and board of directors would be a key step for Xerox to achieve its potential.Another key problem at Xerox is the flawed capital allocation policy. Yes, buybacks and dividends are great for shareholder returns, but wasting money on acquisitions that do not result in any growth is a big mistake. Since 2010, Xerox has made a cumulative ~$1.3B in acquisitions even as the company's net income and free cash flow has shrunk. There has been no accountability on management's end to show that these acquisitions are beneficial for overall operations and accretive for shareholder returns. We believe capital allocation will be at the top of Icahn's priority list, as his past record would suggest.Moreover, Xerox has experienced inefficiency in its labor structure as noted in our previous coverage. In addition to the company's massive $3.6B+ in unfunded pension and health liabilities, its employees on average bring in far less sales than peers, which leads us to believe Xerox is managing its large workforce inefficiently. A large part of this problem stems from its call center operations, which should be reduced and/or outsourced, and a greater focus should be placed on higher-value services.Is Icahn Likely To Get Shareholder Support?We foresee that management and the board will show resistance to change, but Icahn is likely to galvanize shareholders because most are disgruntled that management has failed to deliver on promises time and time again.As seen from its shareholder base, a majority of Xerox's shareholders are mutual fund holders that would be more than willing to side with an activist like Icahn. Noting the past trend of Xerox's share price, even many investors who bought near the bottom would not have experienced strong year-on-year returns as mismanagement has plagued growth prospects.With a disgruntled retail shareholder base, we believe management would be unable to fend off a hostile approach if that became necessary.No Quick Fix To This ProblemKicking out the CEO and other top brass would be the easy part, but fixing the problems with the business would take much more time and effort. We have no indication of whether Icahn intends to stay for the long haul, but his track record shows an organized exit after he believes the potential upside has been achieved.Obviously, a key part of his strategy is to pursue spin-offs or separation of businesses, as evidenced by his ongoing efforts to break-up AIG (NYSE:AIG). At Xerox, there could be a push for selling the equity stake in joint venture Fuji Xerox, or separating the Document Technology and Services segments. Other than the immediate financial benefits, this would give the company renewed direction, perhaps allowing it to manage one business well, instead of managing two businesses in a mediocre manner.However, to create incremental value for Xerox's shareholders, a long-term plan needs to be set in place and competent management must be brought in to execute. It is too early to decide if one should jump into the stock, but an ousting of the CEO would be a very encouraging development and certainly bullish for the company.Next, we will be watching for a change in the compensation committee on the board, and consequently a change in the incentive structure for executive management. These changes may suffice as compelling reasons to buy the stock. After all, with a massive share buyback program, a high dividend yield and Icahn's involvement, the near-term downside is fairly muted.ConclusionWe hope that with Icahn's activist stake, there will finally be a management shake-up that could unlock significant value for shareholders. With valuable assets that could be monetized far more efficiently, Xerox is primed for value creation if bold moves are taken. As such, as believe the bear case may be substantially weakened and there is potential upside for Xerox in the near term."
3654026,24491,2015-11-05T18:07:24-05:00,"Cash flow from operations is expected to be $1.7-$1.9 billion in 2015, while free cash flow is expected to hit the range of $1.3-$1.5 billion for the year.Though the firm cut and eventually eliminated its dividend at the beginning of this century, management may have a better handle on maintaining a reasonable yield amid industry uncertainty.Xerox’s free cash flow generation has been strong as of late, but dividends have often taken a back seat to other capital allocation options.Let's take a look at the company's key investment considerations and uncover the drivers behind its Dividend Cushion ratio.","Key Investment ConsiderationsXerox's (NYSE:XRX) dividend yield is above average, offering nearly a 3% yield at recent price levels. We prefer yields above 3% and generally don't include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend growth portfolio. Though Xerox's yield is high enough for consideration, there are a few things we'd like to cover about its dividend. Let's have a read.• Xerox is focused on business process outsourcing, information technology outsourcing and managed print services and document management. The company has come a long way since patent attorney Chester Carlson first invented the xerography in 1938 -the event that led to its formation. It is headquartered in Connecticut.• Our fair value estimate is supported by Xerox's strong expected cash flow generation. Cash flow from operations is expected to be $1.7-$1.9 billion in 2015, while free cash flow is expected to hit the range of $1.3-$1.5 billion for the year. While robust, this is meaningfully lower than prior years.• Xerox's financial leverage could potentially be concerning down the road. If cash flows begin to weaken, we'd become more cautious on the firm's overall financial health. The firm continues to use its free cash flow to pay down debt, but dividend obligations are limiting the pace at which it can delever.• The company's revenue stream continues to face pressure, but management is as shareholder-friendly as ever. In 2014, for example, the firm returned $1.4 billion through share repurchases and dividends, a 40% increase from the previous year. Dividend-per-share increases have resumed.• The firm's adjusted operating margin hit a near-term peak of 10% in 2011 and has since fallen, despite services segment revenue becoming a larger piece of the revenue pie. We're monitoring profitability closely.Dividend StrengthsAfter Xerox reinstated its dividend in 2008, the company resumed consistent dividend increases in 2013. Xerox's solid Dividend Cushion ratio is driven by our expectations for strong free cash flow generation, even though it has been under pressure as of late. Management has plans to increase the dividend and pay out roughly $300 million in 2015. Though the firm cut and eventually eliminated its dividend at the beginning of this century, management may have a better handle on maintaining a reasonable yield amid industry uncertainty compared to its peers. The stabilization of earnings per share in recent years is a positive for its dividend as well.Dividend WeaknessesThough Xerox's free cash flow generation has been strong as of late, dividends have often taken a back seat to other capital allocation options. The firm only uses 20% of its free cash flows toward paying out its dividend - the majority of Xerox's cash flows are used for share repurchases and acquisitions. We like that management is not worried about maintaining a high dividend yield given its debt load, unlike some of its peers. The company's free cash flows have been dwindling compared to prior years as its business faces ongoing uncertainties. If cash flows continue to weaken, the firm's financial health could be at greater risk, and the dividend could become an afterthought.Dividend SafetyWe think the safety of Xerox's dividend is good. We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straight forward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges, which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying dividends well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Dividend Cushion. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing net cash a company has on hand (on its balance sheet) plus its expected future free cash flows (cash flow from operations less capital expenditures) over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected cash dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends and the expected growth in them.As income investors, however, we'd like to see a ratio much larger than 1 for a couple of reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future. For Xerox, this ratio is 2.4, revealing that on its current path the firm should be able to cover its future dividends and growth in them with net cash on hand and future free cash flow.Dividend Cushion Ratio Cash Flow BridgeThe Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge, shown in the graph below, illustrates the components of the Dividend Cushion ratio and highlights in detail the many drivers behind it. Xerox's Dividend Cushion Cash Flow Bridge reveals that the sum of the company's five-year cumulative free cash flow generation, as measured by cash flow from operations less all capital spending, plus its net cash/debt position on the balance sheet, as of the last fiscal year, is greater than the sum of the next five years of expected cash dividends paid.Because the Dividend Cushion ratio is forward-looking and captures the trajectory of the company's free cash flow generation and dividend growth, it reveals whether there will be a cash surplus or a cash shortfall at the end of the five-year period, taking into consideration the leverage on the balance sheet, a key source of risk. On a fundamental basis, we believe companies that have a strong net cash position on the balance sheet and are generating a significant amount of free cash flow are better able to pay and grow their dividend over time.Firms that are buried under a mountain of debt and do not sufficiently cover their dividend with free cash flow are more at risk of a dividend cut or a suspension of growth, all else equal, in our opinion. Generally speaking, the greater the ""blue bar"" to the right is in the positive, the more durable a company's dividend, and the greater the ""blue bar"" to the right is in the negative, the less durable a company's dividend.Dividend Cushion Ration DeconstructionThe Dividend Cushion Ratio Deconstruction, shown in the graph below, reveals the numerator and denominator of the Dividend Cushion ratio. At the core, the larger the numerator, or the healthier a company's balance sheet and future free cash flow generation, relative to the denominator, or a company's cash dividend obligations, the more durable the dividend. In the context of the Dividend Cushion ratio, Xerox's numerator is larger than its denominator, suggesting strong dividend coverage in the future. The Dividend Cushion Ratio Deconstruction image puts sources of free cash in the context of financial obligations next to expected cash dividend payments over the next five years on a side-by-side comparison. Because the Dividend Cushion ratio and many of its components are forward-looking, our dividend evaluation may change upon subsequent updates as future forecasts are altered to reflect new information.Please note that to arrive at the Dividend Cushion ratio, divide the numerator by the denominator in the graph below. The difference between the numerator and denominator is the firm's ""total cumulative five-year forecasted distributable excess cash after dividends paid, ex buybacks.""Dividend GrowthNow on to the potential growth of Xerox's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity the company has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. To do so, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in the past 10 years, the company has a nice dividend growth rate and a solid Dividend Cushion ratio. We characterize its future potential dividend growth as excellent, which is the case for Xerox.Because capital preservation also is an important consideration to any income strategy, we use our estimate of the company's fair value range to assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss. In Xerox's case, we currently think shares are fairly valued, meaning the share price falls within our estimate of the fair value range, so the risk of capital loss is medium. If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low. Please view our website for information regarding our valuation assumptions.Wrapping Things UpWe love the strong cash flow generation expectations at Xerox, which drive the company's value and its dividend growth prospects. The fact that the company cut and suspended its dividend near the turn of this century may make investors wary of the dependability of its payout, but its Dividend Cushion ratio suggests the dividend in good shape. We wouldn't be surprised to see continued growth in the high-single digits in coming years, but weakening cash flows could pressure this notion. Though there's a lot to like about Xerox, we like companies in the Dividend Growth Newsletter portfolio even more."

There are several series of bonds. The first matures 3/15/16 (Cusip: 984121bp7) and yields 0.684%. The second matures 2/1/17 (Cusip: 984121bq5) and yields 1.998%.

I like the last series the best if I was to make a purchase (which I have not). The debt is BBB rated by S&P.The asset side of the balance sheet shows $804 million in cash, $2.612 billion in accounts receivable, $1.314 billion in financial receivables due less than a year, and $2.57 billion in financial receivables with a due date longer than one year. The liability side shows $1.183 billion in short-term debt, $1.477 billion in accounts payable, $6.393 billion in debt and $2.493 billion in pension liabilities.The balance sheet looks pretty strong. As long as companies keep making payments on their equipment and services, Xerox should be OK. GAAP revenues were down 10% to $4.333 billion in the latest quarter. Much of that was due to the strong American dollar.Moody's notes that the hardware business is very mature. Moody's also noted that in the third quarter conference call management is exploring a strategic review of capital allocations. The bonds are rated Baa2 by Moody's.The market did not like Xerox's announcement to review capital allocations. Fitch put the company's debt on credit watch. The price of credit default swaps have risen and the debt is trading like junk bonds.What could help the debt is if management suspended the dividend and stopped the stock buybacks. I don't think that is going to happen but there is a review of capital allocations. Personally, I think they should suspend both, build cash and develop new products and services. Research and development is the name of the game in tech. To be successful, tech companies should not carry much debt. There was a $1.1 billion share buyback in 2014. That is way too much.According to Morningstar, since 2010, sales have declined and profit margins have been squeezed. It makes sense. If revenues are declining, your expenses certainly will not decline too. Xerox is in a tough place. This is why I generally eschew technology. As for the bonds, my concern is that if I buy the five-year bond, what will the company look like in 2020? Will my bonds be backed by this balance sheet or another company's? It looks like Xerox could be sold, taken private, or broken up. I would want to know what is going to back my bonds before I made a purchase."

Sadly (for the company), it seems the advent and subsequent sophistication of the internet has replaced the company or at least the need for many of the products marketed by XRX.But the company's shares are trading at 14:1 price to earnings, supporters might say, and that is indisputable. Unfortunately, even with a multiple that is far better than the 21:1 multiple seen by the S&P 500 (SPX) average, the company is losing money across every one of its product lines, and there aren't too many indications to indicate a revival.By the numbersAs the savvy investor might infer, the financial situation for XRX is dire to say the least. The company has already come in under revenue expectations nearly every quarter for the last two years, a metric that's more than likely to continue as the company reports earnings on Monday before the market opens. With that knowledge, it seems a safe bet that the company will miss again, coming in below the $454 million mark predicted by various analysts.This is not to say that the number will be inordinately below expectations (most of the last two year's misses were within $60 million). But even a miss of this magnitude is very difficult to dismiss when the gap between expected and reported revenues represents a significant missed opportunity.Earnings will be similarly lowered than expected. Though the company has not released earnings targets (as they did last quarter), it's safe to assume that it will be with a cent or two of an expected $.22 EPS.Such a dip will not be too drastic a drop from last year quarter's reported $.27 but the continuation of EPS under a quarter per is worrying by itself. (To be fair, this is not unexpected in the face of plummeting revenues.)Thoughts for the futureWhat may be more worrying than the financials for XRX may be the company's intentions to develop cloud and business analytical products to the detriment of existing product lines. Some analysts have pointed to a similar transition (albeit more successfully) attempted by IBM (NYSE:IBM). There's a great deal more skepticism as to how successful XRX might be.And this is understandable, though there is little else the company can attempt to combat the slide. With its technology largely obsolete, XRX needs to make a radical change for the company to have any hope for survival.The question becomes whether or not the company can make the transition quick enough for it to matter. Shares have already lost over a quarter of their value year-to-date and will continue to plunge as the company languishes in obsolescence.All of this combines to paint a hauntingly negative picture for a once valued company. With values expected to slide further, it's almost imperative to get out while the market is where it is and minimize losses.Because for right now, the only ink Xerox seems to have is red."

However, the products it makes and markets are not part of the rapidly advancing world of cloud computing. New technologies have replaced the traditional means of sending and storing information by digital media. As a result, Xerox and other document industry firms are experiencing decreased demand for paper-related systems and products. Some investors are even considering Xerox's products and technology old and to some companies, useless. However, in my view, there is a good chance for the company to achieve healthy growth. Xerox is now operating as a leaner organization, having completed the disposition of its IT outsourcing business and begun a $145 million reorganization of its healthcare services organization.On August 28, Xerox announced that it had launched a brand strategy that declares, ""Work Can Work Better.""

Our customers look to us to simplify their business processes and develop solutions that improve their operations and performance.Also, John Kennedy, Xerox vice president and chief marketing officer, added:The technology choices available to address business problems continue to expand. Clients need practical solutions that address the way people, business processes and technology intersect for real business outcomes.Xerox's new brand strategy takes a human-centric view of the benefits made possible when ""work works better"" and is supported with new advertising and digital campaigns.In addition, Xerox has also redesigned its corporate website to be content and social driven, which would enable users to engage from any device. The company also is continually shifting its business model by expanding indirect distribution channel and streamlining its supply chain and product portfolio.On September 01, Xerox announced the acquisition of inVentiv Patient Access Solutions [iPAS], an inVentiv Health company. The acquisition will expand Xerox's pharmacy solutions portfolio with an offering to help pharmaceutical companies drive product adoption and support patients in minimizing or eliminating financial and reimbursement hurdles. Although Xerox has not disclosed the cost of the deal, I believe that the company would not pay an excessive amount for iPAS. The acquisition could contribute to Xerox's pharmacy solutions by enabling affordable access to medications and by controlling reimbursements. According to Xerox, the U.S. spends over $2.9 trillion annually on healthcare or 17.5% of its gross domestic product. With this acquisition, Xerox will expand affordable access to medications, which has the potential to improve significantly health outcomes in the U.S.In my opinion, all the activities mentioned above will improve Xerox results in the coming quarters, and could return the company to a healthy growth.ValuationRegarding its valuation metrics, XRX stock is pretty cheap.

3604086,33291,2015-10-26T14:25:47-04:00,My colleagues have been calling Xerox a dead stock for months and that rhetoric has stepped up today after Q3 earnings.I discuss the earnings and the outlook for the company and whether I would be a buyer here.You can pay up for dividend growth.Should you pay up for declining revenues?A strategic review out of the company could keep this one on life support and possibly revive the name.,"Xerox (NYSE:XRX) is a name I have yet to cover. It's a stock I have watched for years but never really looked into deeply, even with some of my colleagues calling this a dead stock. I was always attracted to the fact that it paid a decent, but not high yield. Currently it pays 2.75%. That is certainly better than shorter-term bonds. Of course, the yield fluctuates with the stock price, but the yield has not hit 3%. That tends to be a personal magic number for me when it comes to dividend ideas. I also can consider dividend growth stocks if they are below this yield because I expect share appreciation and dividend hikes. But is Xerox a dividend growth name? Well, it has been raising its dividend a bit each year since 2012, but the share price, which climbed steadily from the end of 2012 to the start of 2015, has been pressured. In fact, shares are down 26.5% this year. At a 2.75% yield it's will take many years of dividends to recover that loss if you bought shares at the start of the year. Hopefully none of you are in this boat, but you may be. Some are suggesting the stock is dead. The company is dying. I'm not sure, but with the stock just a few percentage points off its 52-week low and the shares approaching the 3% yield mark, I wanted to take a look.So what is the best way to do this? Well first everyone should be familiar with Xerox's business model. They do much more than simply offer copying machines. The company offers processing services to business, software and other services to enhance business productivity. And yes, it still offers printing equipment. What you should know is that the company just released its Q3 earnings report, which I will discuss, and talk about where I think the company is going. I also must point out of course that in conjunction with this release, the company announced that its Board of Directors has authorized a review of the company's business portfolio and capital allocation options, with the goal of enhancing shareholder value. It's unclear when the review will be completed and Xerox will not make any further public comment regarding the review prior to its completion. I want you to keep that in mind as we discuss results.So turning to performance, the reason shares have declined in my opinion is declining revenues. Revenue as a whole came in at $4.45 billion and missed estimates by $90 million. Further, this was down 7.3% year-over-year. Ouch. Of course, as I have discussed in-depth in other articles, the strong dollar has plagued companies with international business. Thus, we need to look at revenues on a constant dollar basis. Doing so, we still see revenues were down over 4% year-over-year. That is a huge negative. Revenue from the company's ""services"" business was $2.4 billion, down 8% or (down 4% in constant dollars) with margins at -7.6%. Revenue from the company's ""document technology"" business was $1.8 billion, down 12% on an absolute basis or 9% in constant dollars. Margin's narrowed to 12.8%.So how about earnings? Well I can first say that expenses are almost 20% of revenues and operating margin was pressured. Considering revenues and expenses, the company saw a net loss from continuing operations of $0.04 per share. Now, we need to factor in some items, including the Health Enterprise charge the company had to take. Doing so we see that adjusted earnings came in at $0.24 per share. This actually beat estimates by a penny, but is down from a year ago. That said, the company did generate decent cash flow of $271 million during the quarter but expects to see its 2015 earnings come in on the low end of guidance. In Q4 it expects to see $0.28 to $0.30 per share in adjusted earnings, but also expects adjusted earnings to be $0.95 to $1.01, likely beneath $0.98.So what to do? Well I have to be honest here I'm not happy with declining revenues and pressured margins. The stock has fallen due to worsening conditions at the company. Still, there are reasons to be positive. Undertaking this review shows the company is aware that it's failing to return shareholder value. At least from an operational standpoint. The management team could likely use a shakeup. This would bring some confidence to investors that the Board isn't playing games. Now, I do applaud the company for raising its dividend and buying back shares at a large clip. The company stepped up buying in a big way in Q3, buying back $691 million worth of stock, which brings the 2015 total to over $1.3 billion. This will help earnings in the long run and will support further dividend increases. But the company has got to step up and work to increase revenues. Is Xerox dead? No, I think that's a stretch. Am I a buyer here? I'd like to be, but I don't want to pay up for just a 2.7% yield and declining revenues. I'd like to see some improvement in the company and some clarity from the strategic review before diving in.Note from the author: Christopher F.

Net income from continuing operations, operating cash flow, revenue and GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations all declined in 2014.Management is as shareholder-friendly as ever. In 2014, the firm returned $1.4 billion through share repurchases and dividends, a 40% increase from the previous year.Total revenue decreased 6% in the first quarter of 2015. The firm expects continued top-line pressure due to increased currency headwinds, softer signings and timing of acquisitions.Let's dig deeper into the company's investment considerations and derive a fair value estimate.","By Brandon UtesXerox (NYSE:XRX) has struggled in recent years. The firm's operating margin hit a near-term peak of 10% in 2011 and has since fallen. Net income from continuing operations, operating cash flow, revenue and GAAP earnings per share from continuing operations all declined in 2014.However, management remains as shareholder-friendly as ever. In 2014, the firm returned $1.4 billion through share repurchases and dividends, a 40% increase from 2013. The firm's dividend currently yields ~2.6%, and we rate its dividend growth potential as EXCELLENT, based on our Dividend Cushion ratio. Xerox also is slowly improving its operating margin, which should improve expectations for future free cash flow generation. However, it's hard for us to pound the table on a company whose business remains under pressure.Case in point, Xerox's 2015 fiscal first quarter results left much to be desired. Revenue fell 6% during the period. The company's services business (which represents 56% of total revenue) grew revenue by 1% on a constant currency basis, while its Document Technology segment was down 6% on a currency neutral basis. Revenue continued its downward trend in the second quarter, falling 7% on a reported basis. The firm's operating margin also faced pressure in the second quarter, falling 160 basis points from the year-ago period. Xerox also recently lowered its bottom-line guidance for 2015.Not all is well at Xerox, but let's take a look at the company's investment considerations and derive a fair value estimate for shares.Xerox's Investment ConsiderationsInvestment Highlights• Xerox is focused on business process outsourcing, information technology outsourcing and managed print services and document management. The company has come a long way since patent attorney Chester Carlson first invented the xerography in 1938 - the event that led to its formation. It is headquartered in Connecticut.• Our fair value estimate is supported by Xerox's strong expected cash flow generation. Cash flow from operations is expected to be $1.7-$1.9 billion in 2015, while free cash flow is expected to hit the range of $1.3-$1.5 billion for the year. While robust, this is meaningfully lower than prior years.• Xerox's financial leverage could potentially be concerning down the road. If cash flows begin to weaken, we would become more cautious on the firm's overall financial health. The firm continues to use its free cash flow to pay down debt, but dividend obligations are limiting the pace at which it can delever.• The firm's adjusted operating margin hit a near-term peak of 10% in 2011 and has since fallen, despite services segment revenue becoming a larger piece of the revenue pie. We're monitoring profitability closely.Business QualityEconomic Profit AnalysisIn our opinion, the best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital with its weighted average cost of capital. The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Xerox's three-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 23.4%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 8.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation rating of EXCELLENT.In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid gray line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate. Xerox is generating economic value for shareholders.Cash Flow AnalysisFree cash flow generation has been solid at Xerox in recent years. Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Xerox's free cash flow margin has averaged about 8.9% during the past three years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG.The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Xerox, cash flow from operations decreased about 20% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures fell about 12% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisThis is the most important portion of our analysis. Below we outline our valuation assumptions and derive a fair value estimate.Our discounted cash flow model indicates that Xerox's shares are worth between $11-$17 each. Shares are currently trading at ~$11, at the very bottom of our fair value range. This indicates that we feel there's significantly more upside potential than downside risk associated with shares at this time.The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's MEDIUM ValueRisk rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $14 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 15.5 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 9.5 times last year's EBITDA.Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of -0.9% during the next five years, a pace that's higher than the firm's three-year historical compound annual growth rate of -4.8%. Our model reflects a five-year projected average operating margin of 7.7%, which is above Xerox's trailing three-year average.Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 0.2% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Xerox, we use a 8.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.Margin of Safety AnalysisEach fair value estimate we provide comes with a margin of safety, within which we feel the company is fairly valued. Our discounted cash flow process values each firm on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $14 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values.Our ValueRisk rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph above, we show this probable range of fair values for Xerox. We think the firm is attractive below $11 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $17 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Xerox's fair value at this point in time to be about $14 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart above compares the firm's current share price with the path of Xerox's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate.The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change.The expected fair value of $18 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $14 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.Wrapping Things UpXerox has its share of investment merits.Though the firm's top-line has been facing pressure as of late, its free cash flow generation has been solid, which has been supporting our fair value estimate. The strong free cash flow has enabled Xerox to reduce its debt position, but a robust dividend payout is limiting the pace at which it can de-lever. Management remains as shareholder friendly as ever, despite profitability declining since a near-term peak in 2011. We think its dividend is in good shape and has room to grow, but it may not forever.All things considered, we're not rushing to add Xerox to the newsletter portfolios at this time. Though the company is trading near the bottom of the fair value estimate range, we would like to see improvement in its relative valuation and technical indicators before growing interested. The company currently registers a 5 on the Valuentum Buying Index."
3375905,80285,2015-07-31T12:12:20-04:00,Services margins continue to decline as Xerox becomes more reliant on this segment.The transition to Services has caused income and cash flows to decline rapidly.Fundamental weakness in Xerox's business model should lead to further under-performance.Xerox's capital allocation policy is flawed and unsustainable.The bull case for Xerox is extremely misguided; the reality is that the company has little upside potential.,"In May, I wrote an article on Xerox (NYSE:XRX) arguing that it was a value-trap despite its low valuation multiples. I also followed up with an analysis of the feckless compensation structure that has spurred a culture of underperformance. The stock has been on a steady downtrend since then, and the dismal Q2 results were released last week. Ultimately, Xerox is a dog with too many fleas - the company suffers from persistent problems with weak business fundamentals, flawed capital allocation and poor management, making it a potential short candidate.Services MarginsA key issue we addressed previously was the thinning margins in the Services segment. Over the years, Xerox has grown to rely more on its Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and Document Outsourcing (DO) business, which now contributes to over 56% of operating revenue. Despite the fact that this transition was planned, Services has performed extremely poorly, largely due to shrinking margins that are now way below initial guidance.We saw a continuation of weaker margins in Q2 as Services margins decreased 1.1% from the same period last year to 7.5%. To put this number in perspective, management gave guidance of 10%-12% for 2015 Services margins. It is now painfully clear that performance has come in way under expectation. This has been caused by both shrinking revenues and a cost-control problem; issues that are not new to the company.In the Q1 conference call, management admitted that they had cost overruns for their government healthcare contract in California as well as their New York Medicaid contract. For a company that claims to make other enterprises more efficient, they could do with more efficiency in their own organization, as platform implementations have been slow and cost-efficiency low.The sequentially declining margins affirm our thesis that Xerox has failed to follow-through on contracts more efficiently. Unless management institutes some new systems in place, it is difficult to see how this trend could reverse.Declining Cash Flows & Net IncomeClearly, Xerox's overall profitability has been declining for a couple of years now. There has been a marked, consistent decline in cash flows and income since 2012. This can primarily be attributed to what we mentioned earlier - the company's transition to the lower-margin Services segment.(Source: SEC Filings)(Note: Segment Margins for 2015 are projected based on the average of Q1 and Q2 margins.)As seen clearly, there is a clear correlation between the company's transition to a more Services-based company and the declines in cash flow and income. The key drivers of bottom-line underperformance are clearly the lower services margins, and Services taking up a bigger portion of revenue. I would venture an educated guess and say that this is happening because management has failed to understand the fundamental economics of their market and overestimated the profitability of the Services segment.Why Are Services Margins Declining Drastically?At its core, Services is not a high-margin business compared to Document Technology. This is because of the inherent labor-intensive nature of the business. Unlike Xerox's traditional business of researching, developing and selling printers, managing a consultancy business is extremely different.Firstly, Xerox derives the large majority of their revenues from federal and state contracts. They rely on government contracts far more than private sector money. The crucial difference between these two markets is that the government is, for the lack of a better word, cheap. The budgetary controls that state entities have to follow means more weight is given to price instead of a reputation for excellence or expertise in the bidding process This has the effect of commoditizing these BPO services and has fairly little room for differentiation or high margins.Compare this to the private sector where more consultancy gigs are decided on the basis of niche expertise, skills and quality. This difference arises from fundamentally different goals: institutions like government-affiliated hospitals engage Xerox's services with the primary goal of meeting compliance and possibly achieving cost savings, whereas private sector projects are about creating value and efficiency. It is no secret that private sector pockets are deeper, and managers are willing to shell out more for sustainable improvement.Another crucial issue with projects like the ones Xerox is taking on is that there is no 'guaranteed' margin. Due to the nature of the business, expected margins at the start of a project are at best an educated guess. Unlike manufacturing printers, consultancy gigs have a very different process: projections and viability studies have to be conducted before each bid to extrapolate a certain expected margin. Unlike producing printers where you have a fixed cost per unit based on the cost of the same materials, labor, etc., the unique aspects of each BPO or DO contract inevitably necessitates a margin of error when estimating margins. These could include things like building a new digital platform, supplying niche software or subcontracting external contractors for their expertise. The accuracy, therefore, depends on how experienced the project manager is and how rigorous the projection methods are.Clearly, the multiple cost overruns suggest that project managers and executives at the top have not been competent in ensuring profitability for the contracts they take, thus resulting in lower-than-expected margins. Although I am unable to point to any specific structure due to the lack of disclosed information, I would venture as far to say that the fault lies in poor management and a lack of cost controls.Also, the labor-intensive nature of Xerox's business leads to high pension and health liabilities. As mentioned in my previous article, Xerox has over $3.6B in unfunded pension and health benefit liabilities which needs to be capitalized eventually. In fact, one of the main reasons for operating margins falling in 2015 was due to higher-than-expected pension expenses and liabilities. If Xerox continues to pivot towards services, liabilities such as these will only increase, at which point they will either need to find better ways to manage the liabilities, compensate for it with higher growth, or experience a financial decline.Unsustainable and Flawed Capital AllocationXerox has what some investors would describe as an extremely shareholder-friendly policy. They have a robust share repurchase programme and distribute a relatively high dividend. However, we need to put these policies in context to discern if returning capital to shareholders is really the best use of capital.Substantially all of Xerox's free cash flow is used for either share buybacks, dividends or acquisitions. Whilst most investors believe buybacks and dividends are great, it is only effective in boosting returns if the stock is undervalued. In the case of Xerox, the dividend and buyback serves another function: to prop up a falling stock price in the face of declining fundamentals.Consider the fact that despite falling revenues, cash flows and income, management is electing to increase buybacks and dividends instead of reinvesting the cash back into the company to boost growth prospects in the long run. To be painfully clear, Xerox's dividends and buyback programme is not sustainable given the decreasing free cash flows from their business.(Source: SEC Filings)As seen above, Xerox's supposed 'shareholder-friendly' buybacks and dividends are clearly unsustainable due to falling free cash flows. Management is already overspending, yet they continue to increase buybacks and dividends. This indicates a lack of budgetary discipline, and indicative of management's please-shareholders-at-all-costs mentality.As cash allocation and free cash flow diverges, Xerox would have to take on more debt to sustain their buybacks and dividends. As seen in the graph above, cash spending on these three categories will drastically overshoot free cash flow this year as management has committed to spending $1.3B on share repurchases, $100M-$400M on acquisitions and $300M on dividends, thus totaling $1.9B if we take the midpoint of the figure set aside for acquisitions. This risk of overspending is exacerbated by the fact that Xerox only generated $387M in FCF in 1H2015. Although FCF tends to increase towards the latter half of the year, it is almost inconceivable that the figure would reach the $1.9B needed to cover these cash expenditures.Furthermore, Xerox already has a large amount of long-term debt, with the debt-to-equity ratio rising from 0.67 at the end of 2013 to 0.76 ($10.3B in long-term liabilities) at the latest quarter. This mainly consists of $3.6B in unfunded pension and health benefit liabilities and roughly $6.1B in long-term debt. Therefore, Xerox cannot afford to take on substantially more debt to fund dividends and share repurchases as leverage is already relatively high. More debt would damage the financial position and possibly the credit rating of the company. In essence, we expect them to either decrease share buybacks in 2016, or begin to incur a substantial deficit as FCF continues falling.We've reiterated many times that Xerox's cash flows and income are declining drastically. However, consider that profitability has been declining despite a cumulative ~$1.3B in acquisitions since 2010. One has to wonder if the acquisitions are adding much value. If we assume the acquisitions are indeed having a positive effect on Xerox's bottom line, that would mean the returns on its core assets are falling even faster than the numbers would suggest.All in all, Xerox's capital allocation policy is flawed as management fails to see the bigger picture - they need to be investing aggressively back into the business to generate more future cash flows so that returns can be sustainable. Instead, they are taking a short-sighted approach and using cash inefficiently.The Misguided Bull CaseAs continued to research on Xerox after initiating coverage, a torrent of rather shallow views on the company emerged on SA (see here, here and here).To summarize their views, bullish analysts essentially choose to focus on the fact that Xerox is a ""cash cow"" generating ""strong free cash flow,"" and that they have ""shareholder-friendly"" policies, while conveniently ignoring the fact that FCF has been free-falling at an average rate of ~6.6% since 2010.Moreover, bulls have not dealt with the fact that Xerox has a huge $3.6B unfunded pension liability sitting on its balance sheet, along with the fact that current FCF levels are not enough to cover buybacks and dividends, making existing shareholder-friendly policies extremely unsustainable.Among all the warning signs the bulls ignore, perhaps the greatest is the fact that Services margins are declining at an unprecedented rate, and that the seemingly ""cheap"" valuations are simply reflecting Xerox's dire prospects moving forward.In essence, whilst bulls would rave about Xerox's free cash flow, low valuation multiples and shareholder-friendly policy, they fail to take into account the deeper underlying issues that plague the company moving forward. The bull case consists of face value and backward looking analysis ignores almost all the warnings and indications that are evident from its poor performance.ConclusionIn my previous article, I labeled Xerox as a value-trap and warned investors to stay clear of the stock. However, the company's serial underperformance and weak fundamentals are slowing, turning it into a short candidate. Combine that with the appalling incentive structure and we may have a viable contrarian short play."
3365705,86896,2015-07-28T16:57:02-04:00,Xerox Corporation reported a lackluster Q2.These earnings are a continuation of less than exciting performance from the once great copier/printer firm.The expenses of their restructuring combined with uncertainty make Xerox not worth the time right now.,"There's a reason Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) is down 20% over the last year. This company is no longer what it once was. The company reported Q2 earnings per share that matched estimates while revenues disappointed at $4.59 billion versus an expected $4.94 billion. It's also worth noting that earnings per share were down relative to last years Q2.Xerox's CEO Ursula Burns emphasized the firms push for restructuring and improvement in the future.Much of the bad news was attributed to expenses involved in restructuring. While this excuse can be used once or twice, does it justify the 5 years of declining revenues? You can't restructure forever. Supposedly the healthcare segment of the company is in very rough shape. A company spokeswoman has been cited saying that the healthcare segment contributes $2 billion to total revenue. That's a big chunk of the business to be considered ""unprofitable"". I personally don't like the odds. While the firm makes moves to supposedly become a services company through acquisitions and restructuring, I fear that investors are in for a difficult ride while we wait to see how it all pans out.The stock is cheap. That much is true. It appears to be cheap because it has very little to offer at this point. Bulls for the stock point to earnings estimates staying in line. The way I see it, the only way that Xerox managed to eek out their earnings is from their shrinking shares. Some may see this as shareholder friendly, I see it as the company buying back at very cheap prices in an attempt to show stronger earnings per share. This way they keep the stock looking less hazardous. Meanwhile, revenues are going down. Annual revenues for the stock have fallen every year since 2011. Revenues for their services sector (the supposed savior of their company) dropped 3% in the first quarter of 2015. Earnings be damned, if revenues keep dropping there won't be any possible way for Xerox to even ""match"" estimates. Earnings per share will start to come up negative. I don't see how Xerox is going to keep making enough cash to keep everything going if trends continue. The balance sheet is even worse considering that Q1 had net tangible assets at ($460) million.To offset the trouble, today the company announced planned workforce cuts of up to 3,000 employees or roughly 2% of their workforce. Interestingly enough, the company said most of these cuts will fall under their services business.There's just too much bad news for me to like Xerox. Over the past 4 quarters assets have decreased while liabilities have grown. There is over $7 billion in debt while the company struggles to keep revenues. The 2.7% dividend is also dangerous considering their finances. I see a once great company that waited too long to adapt to the times. The business stuck to printers and copiers while the world has been going digital. Now, while their margins are eroding, they're trying to play catch up. It's a tough spot. Maybe Xerox will succeed. Maybe they won't. Either way, there are too many other options to invest in to worry about playing around with Xerox Corporation. It looks like it's going to be a $10-12 stock for a quite a while."
3360535,81526,2015-07-27T14:00:31-04:00,"Xerox is in the midst of a transformation into a services company. Its services business now accounts for 56% of revenue and is expected to grow to two-thirds by 2017.The company is trading at just 11.3x estimated 2015 earnings and only 10.2x estimated 2016 earnings, offering substantial value relative to the overall market.XRX maintains a strong balance sheet and generates substantial free cash flow.Xerox has become an increasingly shareholder-friendly company. The company regularly buys back its own stock and has shown a new focus on raising its dividend in recent years.","Xerox: A Company In TransitionIn 2009, faced with a secular decline in its Document Technology business, new Xerox (NYSE:XRX) CEO Ursula Burns made a bold move, announcing the $6.4 billion acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services, giving the company exposure to the growing business services industry. Prior to the acquisition of ACS, Xerox's Services business was relatively insignificant and was not even broken out in its financial statements. However, following the acquisition's completion in February 2010, Services revenue accounted for 44.6% of the company's 2010 total. As Services revenue has grown, and revenue from its legacy Document Technology business has declined, the segment has grown to become a majority of the company's revenue, making up 56% of the total in the company's recently reported 2nd quarter. The company currently projects that Services will become two-thirds of revenue by 2017.The transformation into a services company is important for two main reasons. First, and most obviously, it moves XRX away from an industry experiencing a secular decline and into an industry experiencing secular growth. Second, the majority of revenue from the Services segment is comprised of multi-year contracts, offering high revenue visibility. In addition, as a change in service providers can lead to a costly disruption for customers, contracts are renewed at a high rate, creating an annuity like revenue stream for the company. This simplifies business planning for the company and allows it to allocate capital more efficiently. It also has the added benefit of protecting the company from the unforgiving business capital spending cycle, protecting Xerox's revenue in the event that business spending slows during an economic downturn.It is important to note that Xerox's legacy Document Technology business, while in decline, remains very important to the company as it transitions to Services. While revenue is declining, the segment continues to boast impressive profit margins and generates substantial cash flow for the company. Xerox has been using this cash cow to fund its growth into services and to return substantial capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and a growing dividend. In addition, while the overall Document Technology business is in a slow decline, bright spots, such as its mid-range color, high-end color, and high-end black & white models are continuing to experience growth, indicating that some opportunities for growth in the shrinking industry still remain. Lastly, Xerox is able to leverage the thousands of established business relationships it has developed from its Document Technology business to open the doors for its Services business, an enviable intra-company network to have in place.Xerox: Valuation Presents An OpportunityDespite a nice rally to close the week, Xerox has not performed well over the last 8 months, down 23.6% from its closing high on December 5th, 2014. As a result of this pullback, XRX now trades at an attractive 11.3x estimated 2015 earnings and just 10.2x estimated 2016 earnings, a substantial discount relative to the overall market.(Source: Reuters)Looking at it from a cash flow perspective, the valuation looks even more compelling. Using the bottom end of the company's guidance range, Xerox is trading at an impressive 7.1x projected 2015 operating cash flow and just 9.3x projected 2015 free cash flow.These low valuations suggest that the market is not giving Xerox credit for its transition away from a declining Document Technology business and into a company dominated by its growing Services business. A negative impact from foreign exchange rates is expected to hamper earnings growth this year; however, consensus estimates are calling for 10.3% growth in 2016. Investors should take advantage of this dislocation in market pricing and position themselves for when the market does recognize the value of a transformed Xerox.Xerox: An Investor's Best FriendAnother change underway at Xerox is its transformation into an increasingly shareholder-friendly company. As you can see from the slide below, in recent years, Xerox has substantially decreased its share count using buybacks while simultaneously making significant and steady increases to its dividend.(Source: Xerox Second-Quarter 2015 Earnings Presentation)The magnitude of the buyback in recent years has been impressive, particularly when taking into account that Xerox is not a large company, with a market cap of just $12.1 billion currently. The remaining $689 million that the company plans to spend on buybacks for the remainder of the year alone represents ~5.7% of outstanding shares based on current prices. As a result, by year end, Xerox will have reduced its 2011 share count level by well over 20%.Recent improvements to the company's dividend policy are a bright spot as well. After having a stagnant dividend for multiple years, Xerox raised its dividend by 26.1% in 2013, followed by another increase of 8.7% in 2014 and then 12% earlier this year, giving it a cumulative increase of 53% over the past 3 years. As a result, Xerox now boasts an above-average yield of 2.6%, and, with a payout ratio of just 29% of estimated 2015 earnings, the company has plenty of flexibility to continue increasing its payout well into the future.Xerox: Misunderstood Debt Shadows Strong FinancialsA cursory glance at Xerox's financial statement shows that the company carries ~$7.6 billion in debt, which would represent significant leverage for a company of its size and a risk to investors. However, $3.9 billion of this debt is offset by the $4.6 billion the company holds in financing assets, leaving actual corporate debt at $3.7 billion, a far more manageable debt load for the company.The cash flow statement is where Xerox shines, with operating cash flow expected to come in between $1.7-$1.9 billion in 2015 while free cash flow is expected to come in at $1.3-$1.5 billion on the year. That impressive stream of cash allows the company to easily manage its debt load while still allowing it to return capital to shareholders via dividends/buybacks, and to pursue accretive acquisition opportunities.Xerox: Bringing It All TogetherThe recent decline in Xerox's stock price presents an opportunity for investors to buy into a transformational company at extremely attractive valuations relative to the overall market. The shift in focus to its Services business has put the company on a path to sustained growth, and, as evidenced by its low valuation, the market is not giving the company credit for making that important step. On top of that, Xerox has done all that it can to increase its appeal to investors, rapidly decreasing its share count through ongoing buybacks, with another $689 million (or ~5.7% of its current market cap) expected during the second half of the year. In addition, it has increased its dividend payout by 53% over the past 3 years and now offers an above-average dividend yield of 2.6%. Eventually, the market will give Xerox the credit it is due; investors should buy Xerox now and position themselves to benefit once that realization happens."
3195516,80285,2015-05-19T11:15:35-04:00,Declining services margins in comparison to peers.Unhealthy divergence between earnings and valuation.Structural inefficiencies should not be taken lightly.,"After authoring a series of articles on Xerox (NYSE:XRX), I recently received a response by Praveen Chawla, in which he essentially argues that Xerox is a misunderstood cash cow and that the bull case is more compelling than the bear case. I address the main areas of contention in this article.Declining Margins While Transitioning To A Services-Based CompanyMr. Chawla asserts in his article that I have overstated the risk with regard to Xerox's declining margins as it continues to transition from it's traditional printing equipment business to an annuity-based services model. However, he does not provide any concrete reasons as to why these concerns I have raised are overstated.To recap, here is an image showing Xerox's declining margins in its Services segment, which has become the main segment contributing to its revenue.Clearly, the continued fall in margins cannot be denied; it is a fact. What is more worrying, however, is the capitulation in margins in the first quarter of 2015, when Services margin dropped to an alarming 7.5% from the previous 8.4%.Mr. Chawla seems to suggest the declining margins may be part of a larger secular trend, but as we compare Xerox's margins to its peers in similar industries, this clearly isn't the case.As seen from the margins benchmark comparison, Xerox's margin capitulation is not part of a wider trend in the services market. IBM and CTSH engage in highly similar services offerings such as healthcare, financial, information and technology services, and also tend to operate largely on an annuity-based model. Unlike Xerox, they have been able to establish higher and stronger margins consistently. Hence, these relevant and valid comparisons that show Xerox is essentially underperforming compared to its peers when it comes to Services margins.Hence, contrary to the criticism that I overstated the problem of falling Services margins, I believe this is actually a key issue that Xerox's management has failed to resolve. As the company derives a greater proportion of revenue from Services, lower margins will weigh heavily on earnings. Furthermore, as I mentioned in my previous writeups, management has offered different excuses each time when reporting dismal margins. Thus, I do not see a viable solution being offered to this problem.P/E Ratio and ValuationOn first sight, Xerox's PE ratio seems like a bargain. However, I mentioned how Xerox's rising share price is not because earnings are increasing - it is due to a higher P/E ratio. Essentially, EPS growth has severely lagged behind the rise in share price, and this is fundamentally unsustainable in the long-run.Mr. Chawla makes the case that although Xerox's P/E ratio has risen, so has the majority of the companies in the S&P 500. While he has a valid point that Xerox's rising P/E can be viewed as part of a larger trend of higher share price valuations, the pace of increase in Xerox's P/E ratio is clearly much faster than the wider market: since 2013, Xerox's PE ratio has increased over 1.85x whereas the S&P's PE has increased 1.4x times.Another indication of over-valuation is the fact that Xerox's net income and cash flow has been falling since 2012. If it were the case that net income and cash flow were still experiencing growth, but that P/E was rising faster than the growth rate in earnings/cash flow, it could still be interpreted as a healthy sign. However, this is a case where the fundamentals of the company are stagnating whilst the P/E ratio continues to rise. This divergence is unsustainable and any prudent investor shun a stagnating company with a rising valuation.Unfunded Pension Liabilities & Labour InefficiencyIn my previous article, I alerted readers to the massive $3.6B in unfunded pension and health liabilities, as well as the labour inefficiency at Xerox (per employee revenue is far lower than competitors). The point I made was that Xerox has too much fat in terms of its excessively large workforce and legacy of pension/health benefit liabilities. These are long-term problems that continue to be a plague to expenses, thus posing a risk to profitability.Mr. Chawla argues that this is a rather common problem for large corporations, and that readers should not be overly alarmed as governments ""will inflate their way out of this 'pension crisis' or many of us will be eating cat food in our 90s""Whilst I agree with Mr. Chawla that large pension expenses is a common issue faced by large corporations, note that its competitors are utilizing their labor force much more efficiently as they generate more income per worker. In essence, although they face similarly large pension liabilities, they are able to compensate to a greater extent as each worker is more profitable. That is not the case for Xerox as each employee brings in far less income.Moreover, Mr. Chawla's comment on how the government will inflate their way out of this pension crisis seems to indicate a slight confusion. This pension problem is primarily Xerox's problem, not that of the US government. These are not government pensions; these are corporate pensions. As such, Xerox has the obligation to pay. It is hard to conceive any sort of pension bailout of government interference in these matters.Inflated Free Cash FlowIn my previous writeups I argued that Xerox's free cash flow, while healthy, is overstated. This is due to the fact that cash spent on acquisitions are not factored into free cash flow calculations, thereby artificially inflating the final FCF figure.Mr. Chawla argues that ""it does not matter if R&D is acquired or developed in-house"", as ""many drug and tech companies routinely acquire technology from smaller companies."" Whilst I agree R&D is R&D however it is gained, the accounting treatment does matter.When R&D is developed in-house, R&D costs would be expensed or would form part of Capital Expenditures (CAPEX), which would in turn lower FCF figures. When we think about how much cash is really free, what we want to know is how much cash is left over after paying for all expenses and investing to ensure future streams of income. When a company acquires too much R&D instead of developing it in-house, it is thus appropriate to adjust FCF figures by deducting acquisition expenses to reflect a more accurate value of ""free"" cash. Hence, Mr. Chawla's assertion that I have overstated this point does not appear valid.Flawed Incentive StructureWhile I do disagree with Mr. Chawla on several fronts, I think we do converge on the issue of management's compensation vis-a-vis performance. I would encourage readers to have a look here.ConclusionWhilst high free cash flow figures, share buybacks and dividends can be alluring to any investor, it is more important to examine the fundamental strength of a business and the quality of their management. In Xerox's case, a closer look clearly reveals it is a value-trap. There is greener grass out there, and Xerox simply isn't worth buying. Caveat Emptor."
3156656,80285,2015-05-07T17:37:35-04:00,Adjusted EPS numbers used to measure compensation are not indicative of returns to shareholders.Using an EPS-based metric to measure performance is wholly inappropriate during a period when management is launching large share buybacks.Operating cash flow targets are set so low that cash flow could shrink and executives would still get rewarded.Xerox may have a serious corporate governance issue.,"For the past three years, Xerox's (NYSE:XRX) earnings and cash flow have declined, yet management continues to receive millions in bonuses and share awards. Upon closer examination of the executive compensation structure, we discovered some alarming practices that do not align management's compensation with shareholder's interests.Our analysis will be focused on two key segments of Xerox's executive compensation policy:1) Short-term incentives2) Long-term incentivesOur analysis will show that inappropriate metrics are being used to assess management's performance, and targets are set so low that simply avoiding a steep decline in cash flow and EPS would ensure a large bonus.Short-Term IncentivesXerox uses three key metrics to determine compensation: first, adjusted EPS; second, revenue growth under constant currency; third, operating cash flow. The weights are 50%, 30% and 20%, respectively.We were curious as to how Xerox executives continued to earn massive bonuses due to the EPS segment despite the fact that Xerox's diluted EPS growth had been negative since 2012. Essentially, the compensation committee uses their own non-GAAP measure of an ""adjusted"" EPS. Basically, they take the undiluted EPS figure and add back the amortization of intangible assets to goose the number higher.Despite the fact that diluted EPS growth - which is the better indicator of shareholder return - has been falling since 2012, management's own ""adjusted EPS"" had been growing steadily, enabling them to claim large cash and equity rewards.Furthermore, as Xerox's management continues to implement a large buyback program, using EPS as a key metric for compensation is wholly inappropriate. Consider that even if management does not grow net income, as long as the buyback program is in place and the share count is reduced, they will continue receiving larger compensation because the EPS number will rise higher simply due to the reduced share count. Hence, by adding no value to the company whatsoever, management will receive higher pay.What's more shocking is the target for operating cash flow. The compensation committee saw fit to set the target for a 100% additional base salary payout at 1.9B and a 200% payout at 2.0B, even though OCF for the previous year was already well above these targets at 2.375B.(Source: XRX Proxy Statement 2015)It seems outright ludicrous that the committee has decided to reward executives for shrinking the cash flow instead of growing it. We were equally stunned when coming across this ludicrous compensation policy, until we saw the process from which these targets are set.In companies with more robust corporate governance, the independent committees and board members have a greater role in setting targets and benchmarks to incentivize executives. However, at Xerox, the CEO actually recommends the performance measures for which her own compensation is tied to. This gross breach of independence would explain why anemic targets are set every year that enable the CEO, Ms. Burns, to make millions while the company's cash flow and earnings continue shrinking.When we examine the process, it appears the CEO has the ability to submit inputs at every stage of the process, when it is actually the job of the independent compensation committee to revise and set targets. The independence of the compensation committee is highly questionable given that the CEO has tremendous influence in the compensation-setting process. We believe this could indicate an incestuous relationship between the independent committee members and the CEO - it is certainly too close for comfort.Long-Term Incentive ProgramFor long-term incentives, Xerox uses the similarly flawed criterion of adjusted EPS, adjusted operating cash flow to determine the majority of payouts. The awards are based on cumulative goals over a three-year performance period and are vested for three years from the date they are granted.When we examine the three-year cumulative goals, they appear to be more feckless than even the short-term goals. Given that the goals for the current cycle were set in 2013, we need to view them in the context of the company's performance in the years prior to that. In 2012, Xerox had an operating cash flow of $2.58B. If we simply suppose Xerox were to continue with that performance, it would already exceed the upper limit set at $7.5B. Furthermore, from 2010 to 2011, Xerox had a cumulative OCF of $7.26B, already far above the $6.6B required for a 100% payout equivalent to their base salaries. In essence, the bar was being set so low that the executives simply had to maintain performance, or just prevent a steep decline, to be able to claim the payout under Xerox's long-term incentive program.However, management did not manage to fulfill even that low bar, as cash flows shrunk dramatically to just $2.06B in 2014. We believe this indicates a culture of ""over-promise and under-perform"" at Xerox. This is consistent with the fact that just recently in 2015Q1, the company's Services margins fell to a shocking 7.5% despite the management team having given a guidance of 8-10% margins for that segment (for further details, see here).ConclusionWhile executives should be rewarded handsomely for steering the company in the right direction, Xerox's management has only steered the company downwards in recent years. Yet by using some incredible accounting, the ""adjusted EPS"" they use to measure their own performance has outgrown the diluted EPS that's most indicative of returns to shareholders. Furthermore, there appears to be a systemic culture of underperformance and setting low targets in the corporate governance scheme. As such, we believe such poor corporate governance and incentive structures pose a serious risk for Xerox shareholders."
2849766,67695,2015-01-26T10:35:21-05:00,"Xerox looks very attractive on a revenue, earnings, book, and free cash flow basis relative to the technology sector averages.Surprisingly, Xerox's stock price outperformed over the last six- and twelve-month periods. Xerox is not just a straight ""value"" play.Shareholder buybacks (now set at $1 billion) and the continued transition to the higher margin services segment provide significant tailwinds for the stock.We recommend Xerox as a ""Strong Buy,"" and see the stock continue its outperformance in 2015.","A) IntroductionXerox (NYSE:XRX) is one of the most shareholder friendly companies in the market, evidenced by management's goal to return $1.3 billion - just under 10% of market cap - to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. As we'll discuss in this article, we agree with company management in that Xerox represents a great investment at these prices.The report will start with a breakdown of Xerox's valuation profile, followed by an analysis of price & profit growth, and concluding with some qualitative analysis and conclusions. We take a quantitative approach to investing, preferring to focus our analysis on metrics that have strong predictive ability. Thus, we tend to analyze academic papers and perform historical back tests on different metrics before including them in our analysis. We will provide links to the academic papers we draw inspiration from as we progress through our breakdown of the stock so readers can see for themselves what we base our conclusions on.B) Valuation BreakdownWe'll start by analyzing Xerox's value profile. This is important to look at as ""Value stocks (with low ratios of price to book value) have higher average returns than growth stocks (high price-to-book ratios)"". Xerox's valuation profile is shown below:SourceOn four of the five value metrics shown above, Xerox resides within the top 30% of the entire market. Xerox is unique in that its cash flow yield (Free cash flow/Price) of 9.2% (1/11.1) is actually higher than its earnings yield of 6.5%. This means the company actually generates more free cash flow than earnings. Free cash flow is a more indicative and practical measure of both operating performance and value, as it is less easily manipulated than earnings. On a free cash flow basis, Xerox looks very undervalued compared to its peers with its price/free cash flow of 11.1 being much lower than the industry group (19), sector (67), and overall market (86) averages. While Xerox's dividend yield is below average at 1.8%, the company has announced $1 billion in share buybacks in 2015, leading to a relatively high ""shareholder"" yield. Xerox also sports an attractive sales yield (132%) and price/book (1.36) relative to the office electronics (45% & 2.69) and technology sector (23% & 5.08) averages. Overall, our model rates Xerox as ""Strongly Undervalued"" and we expect the stock to generate 9.77% of outperformance over the market in the next 12 months due to its relative undervaluation.C) Growth BreakdownThere are a variety of different growth metrics that have been shown to predict stock returns. Most important among them is price momentum. Winning stocks keep winning, and losing stocks tend to keep losing. Xerox's growth profile is shown below:SourceWhile Xerox inherently seems more of a value than momentum play, the stock's six-month price performance (+10.4%) is better than its industry group (+7%), sector (+4.5%), and overall market (+0.34%) averages. The stock outperformed over 2014, gaining 18.2% over the last twelve months versus 2.5% for the overall market average. As shown in the link to the academic paper above, on average, strong momentum leads to future strong momentum. Thus, we actually interpret Xerox's strong price performance as a good sign. Besides momentum, Xerox has had average profit growth (+7% annual EPS) and profit efficiency (9% ROE). Overall, our model rates Xerox as a ""Weak Growth"" company and expects them to outperform the market averages by 1.68% over the next twelve months due to their growth profile.D) Qualitative Analysis & ConclusionAs always, we will finish our quantitative breakdown of Xerox with a qualitative discussion of potential growth catalysts and business risks. First off, Xerox's massive share buybacks have arguably the biggest driving force behind the stock's outperformance over the last 2 years. Share buybacks effectively increase the amount of ownership of each shareholder and drive the stock price upwards in the interim with increased demand for shares. Xerox is a cash flow machine, having generated almost $600 million last quarter alone (as per the earnings transcript). This has allowed Xerox to increase their share buybacks guidance from $700 million to $1 billion. As mentioned in the last quarter earnings call, Xerox management knows that their stock is undervalued and they intend to use their cash flow to capitalize. Xerox has maintained a significant share buyback program for a number of years, and we don't see this program ending anytime. Xerox has also made a successful shift from their low margin hardware business to the high margin business services segment (now 55% of revenues). This shift is expected to continue to 2017 when management expects 67% of revenue to be generated by the services segment.Before beginning with our conclusions, we'd also like to point the incredibly low level of short interest in Xerox's stock:High short interest tends to be a precursor to lower future returns, as short sellers tend to be very sophisticated investors. The fact that short interest is so low is a good sign that shorts don't see much downside in the stock.Overall, we feel Xerox combines a very attractive valuation with solid price momentum and an extremely shareholder friendly management team. Their significant and increasing share buyback plan and continued transition to higher margin service segments will continue to provide tailwinds to the stock price. We recommend Xerox as a ""Strong Buy,"" and expect continued outperformance from the stock in 2015. Investors looking to learn more about our analytical style can do so here."
3187866,66103,2015-05-16T14:09:18-04:00,XRX is generating high cash return and improving its balance sheet.XRX appears to undervalued.XRX is a company in transition - moving to a services-dominant business model from a product-dominant model.XRX bull case is more compelling than the bear case.,"Recently I wrote an article titled The Concept of Cash Return, or C.F.I.M.I.T.Y.M, or why ""Cash Flow is More Important Than Your Mother."" Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) was on the list of CFMITYM stocks with cash return of over 7% per annum and market cap of over $10 billion. This article takes a deep dive into XRX financials.Xerox provides business process solutions (55% of revenues) and document management solutions (40%), specifically, services, technology and expertise to enable customers, ranging from small businesses to large global enterprises, to focus on their core businesses and operate more effectively. Through its business process outsourcing, Xerox has expertise in managing transaction-intensive processes. These include enterprise support through multi-industry offerings for customer care, transaction processing, finance and accounting, and human resources, as well as industry-focused offerings in areas including healthcare, transportation, financial services, government, retail and telecommunications. Xerox's document technology products and solutions provide clients with an efficient and cost effective printing and communications infrastructure. Related offerings help customers optimize their use of document systems and related document workflow and business processes. In December 2014 Xerox announced a plan to sell its IT outsourcing business to Atos SE, an international IT services company, for $1.1 billion with the transaction expected to close mid-2015. This should open the way for further stock buybacks and/or business acquisitions in the core document management and BPO business.Figure 1 below compares XRX's Cash Return with its Earnings Yield and 10 years US treasury yield. At present Xerox is generating 8.7% of cash return compared to a 10-year US treasury yield of 2.28%.Figure 1 - Cash return and earnings yield over timeOver the last decade Xerox has transitioned from essentially an equipment supplier (photocopiers, printers etc.) to a hybrid equipment- services model (services represents 57% of revenues in 2015 and is expected to rise to 75% of revenues in 2017). By transitioning to a services model, Xerox is changing its revenue into an annuity like stream powered by multi-year exclusive contracts with large organizations providing stability and visibility to investors. This should result in Price / Expansion in the medium to long term. Current P/E ratio is 14.Figure 2 - Financially XRX is in a strong position with long term debt / equity below 1 and interest coverage of 12 times.Xerox has been returning cash to stock holders via dividend (Dividend yield of 2.47%) and stock buybacks. As figure 3 below shows Xerox's stock buyback rate in the last 12 months has been around 8%. This together with the dividend is over a 10% return on the stock. Essentially XRX is returning most of the free cash to investors via dividends and stock buy backs.Figure 3 - Free Cash flow, Dividend Yield and Stock Buy back YieldValuationXRX has traded at a median P/E of 14 over the last 10 years. Based on P/E it appears to be about fairly valued. However keep in mind the 10% return we are getting via dividend and stock buybacks.Figure 4 - Median P/E over last 10 years.My Discounted Cash Flow Calculations show a 40% margin of safety. I have used a growth assumption of 7.66% and discount rate of 9%.Table 1 - Discounted cash flow calculations.Earning Power Value method pioneered by Professor Bruce Greenwald of Columbia University confirms a significant margin of safety.Table 2 - Earning Power Value calculationsUsing Graham's revised formula for growth companies confirms a valuation of $15.77. Of course it's debatable if XRX can be considered a growth stock. XRX has no tangible book value.Table 3 - Benjamin Graham's formula for growth stocks.Therefore overall it appears that Xerox is currently selling at a decent margin of safety.The Bear Case on XeroxJohn Zhang has written a couple of very interesting articles on XRX recently which is required reading for anyone considering an investment in XRX. Here's my take on his arguments.In his article, Xerox: A Mid-Cap Value Trap, John makes the following points.Let us look at each of these points.Margins.Figure 5 below provides XRX's overall profit margins. While gross margins have declined since early in the decade there has not been a dramatic effect on operating or net margins. There's no doubt that XRX is transitioning from a mainly hardware based company to a services / business process company. I'm not sure if the decline in net margin is a secular trend. So in my mind, the jury is still out on this point. I think John Z overstates the bear case here with respect to margins.Figure 5 - Profit MarginsFree Cash FlowJohn Z states that free cash flow is overstated. John says that ""Xerox makes acquisitions amounting to hundreds of millions a year, buying smaller companies to add to its array of technology, patents and intellectual property. This is essentially 'buying R&D' instead of increasing expenses for organic R&D. However, since acquisition expenses are not included in CAPEX, the free cash flow figure becomes disproportionately high. This causes many investors to fall into a trap when they fail to recognize that the money spent investing for future revenue is much higher than what the CAPEX figure would suggest. Hence, to reach a more accurate amount of how much of Xerox's cash flow is really 'free,' we have to factor in the acquisition expenses every year.""The following chart provides XRX free cash flow. While free cash flow (NYSE:FCF) in absolute terms has declined from 2012-13 it's clear that the overall trend is that XRX continues to pay down debt and buy back stock while investing in new acquisitions. He states that acquisition investment should be included in FCF. This not the definition of FCF and in any event as Figure 1 above shows Earnings Per Share is consistent with cash return per share. Here again, I believe John Z overstates his bear case here. It really should not matter if R&D is acquired or developed in-house. Most drug and tech companies routinely acquire technology from smaller companies. As long as XRX has the ability to further refine and scale technology it's able to create value.Figure 6 - Cash FlowP/E RatioJohn Z states the XRX rally in the recent year was driven by P/E expansion and not by increasing earnings per share. As the chart above shows XRX has traded around P/E 14 consistently for the last decade (except for the period from mid-2011 to 2014 when the P/E was clearly depressed (and XRX was great value). It is true that XRX P/E has expanded in the last seven years - but so has almost every company in the S&P 500.Figure 7 - XRX P/E Ratio's vs S&P 500 P/E over last 10 yearsContract Renewals/Structural Inefficiencies/Labor Force ProductivityJohn Z expresses dissatisfaction with these metrics but I have no idea how to evaluate these. I'm not sure what is the appropriate bench mark or what the comparable companies are. Therefore I'm going to remain neutral on this opinion.Pension and Health Benefit Liability BombJohn Z highlights a $3.6 billion in unfunded pension and health benefits liability for Xerox. Again John Z has not put this in perspective. These are based on actuarial assumptions and we are not sure what these assumptions are. This seems to be a rather common problem for large businesses and governments and likely driven by low bond yields. So I'm not sure how much weight to put on this factor, but I'm wary of being overly alarmed by this rather large liability. I have a feeling that over time governments will inflate their way out this ""pension crisis"" or many of us will be eating cat food in our 90s.GovernanceJohn Z in his article Inferior Performance Pays Well at Xerox is not happy with XRX's performance vis-a-vis management compensation. John Z does have a strong point here. XRX compensation, particularly that of the CEO Ursula M. Burns, has exploded in the last year while the stock price has stagnated.ConclusionOverall I believe the bull case is more compelling than the bear case. Xerox is returning substantial amount of cash to shareholders via buybacks and dividends. It is selling off its non-core operations (like IT outsourcing) and investing in business process services while managing the decline of document technology. Valuation metrics indicate that XRX is undervalued by 20% to 40%. XRX faces intense competition but on the positive side it may be a target for a takeover by a large international business services company like Cognizant (NASDAQ:CTSH), post break-up HP (NYSE:HPQ) or an Indian outsourcer like Infosys (NYSE:INFY) or Tata Consulting Services. Morningstar currently rates XRX as a 3 star with a fair value of $10 per share. S&P rates Xerox as a 5-star stock with a 12-month target of $14. I would like to start nibbling at XRX below $11 and loading up between $10 and $9 per share."
2818266,71975,2015-01-14T17:37:16-05:00,"Xerox has the lowest Price to Free Cash Flow (P/FCF) ratio among large capitalization U.S. stocks.Xerox offers an approach to investing in the underlying trend of a ""young"" internet ""maturing"" to impact more facets of everyday life.Xerox is at the forefront of several new technologies that most investors are likely not aware of.Xerox's substantial free cash flow will continue to mean sizable share repurchases that underpin earnings growth and strategic acquisitions that complement its growing Services segment.","Price to Free Cash Flow (P/FCF) is one of my favorite metrics for analyzing a company. Free Cash Flow is the amount of actual cash a company has left over in a given year after reinvesting in their business. Net income (or earnings) is obviously important for revealing a company's operational performance, but it is still somewhat hypothetical to the shareholders' bottom line because it includes non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization. Furthermore, a company needs to have free cash flow to (1) pay dividends, (2) repurchase shares, and (3) make strategic acquisitions. Nevertheless, the two do tend to track each other over time. I prefer to use both in tandem when analyzing a company.I have been following Xerox (NYSE:XRX) for several years now and hold it in client portfolios. I was recently struck by how low their P/FCF ratio currently is. I ran a stock screener for large capitalization companies (assets > $15 billion) with the lowest Price / Cash Flow (P/CF) ratio and Xerox spit out as #9. I was unable to find a stock screener that screened for P/FCF, only P/CF. After looking at the companies ahead of Xerox and slightly behind them in this ranking, I did not find any close to having a P/FCF ratio as low as them. It looks like Xerox currently has the lowest P/FCF ratio of any large cap company trading on U.S. exchanges. This is especially true when you drill down to the technology sector. After running the same screen for the sector, I found that no one even comes close. At $14 a share, I calculate their current P/FCF ratio to be about 11.3 and I estimate it to decline to 9.5 in 2016 (more on this later). This compares to a P/FCF for the technology sector of 18.6, according to Morningstar.Let us take a look into (1) what has been going on at Xerox, (2) why they have so much free cash flow (and will it continue?), and (3) what this ultimately means for earnings growth and valuation.Change is afoot at XeroxA strategic transformation began at Xerox in 2010 after it acquired Affiliated Computer Services (ACS). ACS was a leader in business process outsourcing and information technology solutions. These businesses were complementary to Xerox's existing Document Technology operations and a major step to diversify the overall company's revenues. The rise of the digital age and the continued decline of the copy and print industry finally forced a change.Today, Xerox is strategically aligned into two business segments - Services and Document Technology. Only about 40% of its revenue now comes from its heritage Document Technology business. The remaining 60% comes from its Services segment that consists of its Business Process Outsourcing (""BPO"") and Document Outsourcing (""DO"") businesses. Just a few weeks ago, Xerox sold its Information Technology Outsourcing (""ITO"") business to Atos for $1.05 billion and clipped off this business from its Services segment.The following is a more detailed look at what businesses each of these segments are engaged in. (Unless otherwise noted, this information is from various company reports and presentations, as well as the company's website.) Knowing the details here is essential to gauging the durability and growth potential of the company's future cash flows. I have also included some interesting examples of how Xerox continues to drive innovation in its Services segment. Xerox is creating all sorts of new analytical tools for a wide array of industries, often in areas where you would least expect them to be. The company is quietly positioning itself to be more dynamic in the years to come.Services segment1. Business Process OutsourcingBPO accounts for about 68% of revenues within the Services segment. Xerox's BPO business is the largest of any company in the world. It has come to increasingly reflect the new Xerox and in a few years will likely account for about half of the firm's overall revenue. The company estimates that business process outsourcing is currently about a $291 billion industry that will grow to $348 billion in 2017.BPO specializes in transaction-intensive services for the following industries and client types (keep in mind that many of these services and the industries served intersect with each other):Government Healthcare - Xerox is heavily involved in providing solutions that support programs for Medicaid expansion and state Health Insurance Exchanges. They provide administrative and care management solutions and services to the Federal government and 36 different states. They provide Health Insurance Exchange support services to 7 states, while 13 states use their enrollment services, and 23 states use their Health Information Exchange-related solutions. The following map illustrates the reach of their Government Healthcare business:Courtesy of Xerox CorporationCommercial Healthcare - Xerox provides solutions to healthcare providers, health insurance plans, and pharmaceutical companies to aid them in delivering healthcare more effectively and with greater administrative efficiency. Two-thirds of all insured patients and 1,900 hospitals in the U.S. are touched by Xerox's services. They service every large health system in the U.S. and have contracts in all 50 states.In France, Xerox's European Research Centre has developed image processing software with patented techniques for monitoring and analyzing the video streams coming out from the vital signs of premature babies. This helps prevent infections as the technique requires no human physical contact. The system is now being tested in a hospital in India.Transportation - Xerox provides public transit and fare collection, electronic toll collection, parking management, photo enforcement, and commercial vehicle operations services to government clients in over 35 countries. They are now the largest electronic toll collection service provider in the U.S.The company recently worked with the City of Los Angeles to develop an application that steers drivers to lower fee parking spaces further away to reduce parking congestion. This application created efficiencies that led to a decrease in parking fees, while increasing revenue for the city.Government Services - Xerox provides services, such as tax and revenue systems, payment processing, electronic records management systems, auto indexing for data entry, and document preservation and management systems to federal, state, county and municipal government agencies.With governments becoming more and more desperate for revenue, Xerox's ability to provide solutions for cost savings and increased efficiency is very attractive. For example, the County Clerk in Denton County, Texas, saved more than $1 million by implementing Xerox's 20/20 Perfect Vision records management system.Retail, Travel, Litigation and Learning - Xerox provides transactional services specific to these industries. Frequent flyer program transaction processing is one example.Financial Services - Xerox manages finance, accounting and procurement processes for clients across multiple industries. They provide financial aid and enrollment outsourcing services to colleges and universities. They also provide back office functions such as customer service, transaction processing, and mail room operations to financial services firms. For example, they are the largest provider of Federal Perkins loans services in the U.S.Xerox data scientists uses Big Data analytics and predictive technologies with free data sources (e.g., social networks and not FICO scores) to identify at risk borrowers ahead of time in its $60 billion-plus managed student loan portfolio so that proactive measures can be taken ahead of time to reduce delinquency and default.Human Resource Services (""HRS"") - Xerox estimates that the global business process outsourcing market for HRS is $65 billion and growing at 8% per year. They provide HR consulting, management, and outsourcing service, as well as benefit administration services and employee training programs to 2,000 clients in 72 countries and in 23 languages. For example, Xerox developed a workforce training program for Hertz to help them train new hires and develop future managers.Xerox's Buck Consulting unit offers RightOpt, a private healthcare portal for employers to reduce costs and provide health coverage to their employees. Recently, Church & Dwight estimated that this has saved them 11% in claims costs in one year.Customer Care - Xerox provides customer service, sales services, business intelligence, customer outreach services, and customer relationship management.Xerox uses predictive analytics to mine data on call center text transcripts from customer service calls. This data can be used to quickly pinpoint issues with products or services that a firm's management can address. The company's overview of similar techniques here is intriguing.Communication and Marketing Services - Xerox delivers end-to-end outsourcing for design, creation, marketing, logistics and distribution services that help clients communicate with their customers and employees more effectively (from 2013 Annual Report).2. Document OutsourcingXerox is the world leader in document outsourcing services. They offer Managed Print Services (""MPS"") and Centralized Print Services (""CPS"").Xerox's MPS unit works with clients to automate (e.g., digitizing documents) and optimize their printing processes. They have been consistently recognized by analyst firms as the industry leader in MPS.CPS are utilized by businesses and other organizations to produce on-demand documents, such as a manufacturer that needs to quickly produce variants of different product manuals. Xerox helped the Methodist Healthcare System implement an in-house CPS solution that saved them about $2 million. They can print clinical forms that meet healthcare compliance requirements just-in-time without having to hold any inventory.Document Technology segmentXerox's Document Technology business is what most people know them by. They sell printers and other multi-function devices (and supplies) and the related technical services and financing to small and medium size businesses and large enterprises. Walk into the print shop at your local Staples and you will likely find they are using large Xerox printing machines. This segment also sells software to automate business workflows.Future OpportunitiesMy research on Xerox has led me to several important conclusions about potential opportunities for the company.Xerox has an outstanding history of innovation and they continue to be at the forefront of applying new technologies for practical purposes. I believe the use of the internet is still in its infancy and its impact throughout all facets of everyday life is just getting started. Xerox offers an approach to investing in this underlying trend. Once many of their solutions take hold they have the potential to be multiplied through sales to hundreds and thousands of similar client types that are hungry for effective, cost saving solutions. The previously mentioned the parking management solution they developed for Los Angeles is a good example of this. The technology for this system was developed at their Grenoble, France, research center (one of five they have). Now that a pilot has been put in place, and proven to be effective, it can be sold to countless other cities in need of increased revenue and less parking congestion.Xerox has been putting a lot of research and development (R&D) into the cutting edge ""printed and flexible electronics"" technology. Research directors at Gartner have recently referred to this as an industry ready to break out. This is a focus area of the company's Palo Alto Research Center (""PARC"") and Xerox Research Centre of Canada. Xerox has developed a silver ink that can be used to print circuits. The company mentions that this could be used to develop display screens that roll up like a piece of paper. It seems that a reasonable starting point here is manufacturers being able to integrate electronic components into such things as plastics and textiles. Electronic clothing anyone? This is important to know when considering an investment in the company. There are all sorts of potential revenue drivers down the road that could spring forth to energize the company's outlook. It seems that there is hardly anyone in the near-sighted investment community that has the slightest idea about any of this. Something like this could come out of nowhere to support the stock and blindside analysts.Xerox's transition to a business services oriented firm has been slow, but this is not altogether bad if the right foundation is laid. What really jumps out is the massive potential for Xerox to aggressively cross sell its products, services and solutions that intersect at so many different points. This is probably the number one aspect to keep an eye on to measure the effectiveness of the current management team. It does seem that they are focused on it. On their last earnings call, Bob Zapfel, President of Xerox Services, mentioned that they won all 20 of their outstanding deals during the third quarter. However, CEO Ursula Burns told him if they are not losing any deals, then they are not covering enough. Subsequently, they are now increasing their sales coverage and implementing a more aggressive training program.Just looking at the cover of Xerox's business, it would seem that their revenues are susceptible to government cutbacks. However, most of the services they provide are essential, implemented through ""sticky"" longer term contracts, and/or often lead to increased efficiencies and cost savings for the governments who employ them. During the most recent U.S. elections, I noticed several politicians touting the funds they saved by implementing better technologies or systems, so to some extent this plays to their favor.Free Cash FlowLet us now take a look at the primary components of Xerox's free cash flow to examine its predictability and sustainability.Xerox has a lot of items moving through their Cash Flows from Operating Activities statement, however, depreciation and amortization comprises most of the variation between their Net Income and actual Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Here is a look at the results from the last four years:The average difference between: Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities - (Net Income + Depreciation and Amortization) over the last four years has been -$412 million. For the most part, this difference is comprised of annual changes to their account receivables and finance receivables.Xerox has averaged about $2.1 billion a year of net cash from its operations over the last four years.Xerox has averaged about $1.3 billion in depreciation and amortization expenses since 2011. The $1.358 billion of depreciation and amortization expenses they reported for 2013 were comprised of the following:Xerox is anticipating capital expenditures to be about $500 million in 2015. Given this, and the relative consistency of leasing out equipment to business customers, I do not anticipate any major changes in the near term to its depreciation. A large piece of their amortization has been the amortization of acquired intangible assets. This is expected to continue, with the company projecting it to be $323 million a year from 2016 to 2018. Overall, I am comfortable using $1.3 billion as an estimate of future depreciation and amortization for the next few years. This also is a good baseline for future estimates, since it includes the addition of ACS and the subsequent makeover of the firm.Impact of Free Cash Flow on Future EarningsTaking into consideration the recent sale of Xerox's Information Technology Outsourcing business, I made some earnings projections for 2016 and 2017. I decided to skip 2015 since it is not clear to me how the sale of the ITO business will shakeout on the income statement (it is being reported as a discontinued operation). Xerox has provided adjusted EPS guidance of $1.05 to $1.11 for 2015.In my last True Vine Letter I released a seven-year forecast which calls for the U.S. stock market to essentially move sideways over the next 3 years. (Note: I will soon be revising the economic side of this forecast in my next issue to one of a deflationary trend (2016 - 2018) before higher inflation begins (2019 - 2021). My original stock market forecast remains unchanged though.) Given this, I am reasonably confident in Xerox being able to meet the estimates below before bad things arrive in 2018.Based on my analysis, I think Xerox can grow its earnings per share at an average annual rate of 10%. Using True Vine Investments proprietary stock evaluator and my moderate outlook on the company, I am currently willing to pay 10.5 times the higher of either my 2016 EPS or FCPFS estimates. My 2016 FCFPS estimate of $1.47 then yields a price target of $15.45.One well-known investment company currently has a fair valuation of $12 on the stock. I think they are underpricing the company and doing so due to the fact that they are missing the substantial impact of Xerox's free cash flow. My estimates for Xerox's shares outstanding at the end of 2017 mean the company will remove over 12% of their outstanding shares over the next three years. This has a major effect on earnings per share. The following table demonstrates this impact (assuming Xerox ended 2014 with 1,165,000,000 shares outstanding and repurchases all shares at an average price of $14):The impact of Xerox's share repurchases over a few years is substantial. As I already mentioned, they are planning on buying back $1 billion in 2015 and given their projected free cash flow there is no reason why they could not maintain that level beyond this year. With a multiple target of 10.5 the difference in target price for 2017 between no share repurchases (FCFPS of $1.41 x 10.5 = $14.81) and $1bil per year (FCFPS of $1.72 x 10.5 = $18.06) would be $3.25. I think my $500 mil share repurchase estimate is relatively conservative, given that this is slightly less than one-third of my projected free cash flows for 2016 and 2017.Here is a scenario to think about. If (1) we get into a market correction later this year and (2) Xerox is trading in the $12 range and (3) it looks like they may continue with $1 billion a year in repurchases in 2016, then I will consider ""backing up the truck"" as a 50% upside comes on the horizon over a 1.5 to 2 year timeframe just to hit a P/FCF target of 10.5. Keep in mind also that companies tend to buy back a lot of shares over the last two months of the year to meet their announced targets.Share repurchases are fine, but I would prefer to see Xerox put a lot more free cash flow into their dividend. In the current, yield-starved market environment I think the stock price would be a lot higher if they were paying out half their free cash flow in dividends. This would mean a yield of around 5%. I can see the market driving the stock higher until the yield is down in the 3% range.It seems that the large amount of share repurchases are primarily geared toward keeping earnings per share growing while the transition to a company that is predominately Services takes a painfully long time. In the coming years a slowdown in the pace of share repurchases could be a signal that management sees faster organic growth ahead or simply better acquisition targets. Either way, this would imply an opportunity for higher revenue growth.For 2015, Xerox has allotted up to $900 million for acquisitions. The last row in my table of estimates above shows the additional amount of free cash flow Xerox would have left in 2016 and 2017 to be $729 and $787 million. The company previously had a target of Services comprising two-thirds of revenues by 2017. However, the sale of ITO will make this difficult to achieve without substantial acquisitions filling the gap. The potential for strategic acquisitions is a real wild card here and something for investors to not lose sight of.ConclusionXerox's P/FCF was 4.1 at the end of 2012 and the stock has since more than doubled.XRX data by YChartsIn retrospect, it seems as if the market was viewing the company as solely a dinosaur in the declining copy and print industry and did not recognize the transition underway to a more dynamic business services company. With a current P/FCF ratio that is the lowest in the entire large cap universe it seems that the market is still learning.The strength of Xerox's free cash flow and subsequent share repurchases is underpinning earnings growth and enabling the potential for sizeable strategic acquisitions in the near term. The internet is young and we are just beginning to find out how it can transform everyday facets of our lives. Xerox is an innovative company with the potential to surprise in the years ahead.Important Regulatory Disclosures:I am a Registered Investment Advisor in the State of Pennsylvania.

3148376,80285,2015-05-06T14:10:08-04:00,"Significant pressure on Services segment margins.Free cash flow is overstated.Share price rally is a result of increasing P/E instead of growing earnings or cash flow.Xerox's structural inefficiencies are creating a drag on returns.Shareholder-friendly policy is the single bright spot, but close competitors also offer similar advantages. Overall, Xerox is a value trap.","With Xerox's (NYSE:XRX) share price getting pummeled in the past month, we wondered if the company was attractive at current levels. To determine whether Xerox is a worthy buy, we ask two basic questions: First, is Xerox a sustainable, profitable company; second, is it cheap enough for a significant margin of safety? When we first examined Xerox's metrics, the stock appeared extremely attractive due to high free cash flow figures, buyback volume and dividends. However, upon further examination of the fundamental business, its prospects were revealed to be far less attractive.Xerox operates in two main segments: Services and Document Technology. Its Services segment consists of Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and Document Outsourcing (DO). Essentially, Xerox is a B2B company, deriving most of its revenue from long-term contracts. Its Document Technology segment is what most consumers are familiar with: printers, inkjets and numerous other devices, but the company has been increasingly diversifying into Services, specifically focusing on the BPO business.Business Process OutsourcingThis is essentially a consulting business that focuses on optimizing efficiency for companies that deal with transaction-intensive processes. Examples include information management for healthcare providers, parking systems for municipalities, and so on. Essentially, BPO is about making processes easier, cheaper and faster. Hence, its biggest clients are usually businesses or government organizations that handle a large volume of transactions, such as healthcare providers, government programmes like Medicaid, Human Resource-related services, tax & accounting service providers etc.As you may have guessed, Xerox's biggest customer in this segment is the U.S. government. A large percentage of revenue is derived from government-linked institutions such as public hospitals and school systems. Hence, legislation has a significant impact on Xerox's earnings. Take the Affordable Healthcare Act for instance, the new requirements for many public healthcare providers brought in a ton of extra business for Xerox as public hospitals were required to improve operations and take greater measures in terms of patient follow-ups, medical records and other aspects. In the same vein, a reduction in the funds allocated to these public institutions would be a big risk to Xerox's earnings.Document OutsourcingThis segment of Xerox's business consists of developing software and hardware solutions. Primarily, it offers Managed Print Services (MPS) and Centralized Print Services (CPS). Xerox's clients in this segment include both SMEs and large corporations with significant printing and information management needs. For instance, Xerox helps clients to digitize content, collect and analyze data, integrate traditional printing operations into more advanced IT systems, etc. In essence, it tries to provide value-added hardware/software services that go beyond simple print-and-publish operations.Document TechnologyThis does not require much explanation as most people are familiar with Xerox's printing devices. What we do need to note is Xerox has been moving away from entry level products to focus on mid-range and high-end products, such as high-definition color printers and other niche products to appeal to graphic designers and people who require higher-quality printing. This allows Xerox to extract higher margins, and explains why DT margins have been far more stable and robust compared to Services margins.Earnings & Margins AnalysisXerox has a annuity-based business model. In 2014, 84% of total revenue was derived from contracts, whereas the remaining 16% comprised of equipment sales and other short-term lease agreements. Hence, a good barometer of Xerox's ability to retain and grow earnings is the contract renewal rate, and total contract value of new signings, which we will discuss later. The margins on its services segment (which accounts for roughly 54% of total revenue) is also crucial as it indicates the company's profitability during a time when the Xerox is trying to transition into a Services-based company.As seen above, Xerox has been diversifying away from its traditional document technology segment and gradually becoming a more services-based company, with Services revenue comprising a greater percentage of the mix. However, revenue growth from Services has been largely stagnant and has not compensated for the fall in DT sales. Another worrying sign is that Services is experiencing increasing margin pressure.Since 2010, Services margin has dropped with frightening consistency, from nearly 12% to 9% in the most recent year. Previously, management stated that they had a long-term goal of maintaining Services margin at 10-12%; it seems now they have 'exceeded' their own expectations to the downside. In the first quarter of 2015, Services margin fell further to a shocking 7.5%.What can we attribute this fall in margins to? In the latest conference call, management largely shifted the blame for falling margins in Q1 2015 to higher costs related to the rollout of the Health Enterprise platform in California. However, Bill Shope from Goldman made a revealing statement:This aptly summarizes management's inept response to queries about falling margins. The reason given is different each time, it seems as though they have not factored these recurring problems into their strategy and guidance, consequently leading to unexpectedly lower margins and sub-par performance.Thus far, Services margins have been falling largely as a function of rising costs and stagnant revenue growth. Management has yet to prove they can widen margins for Services despite their lofty goals. When we analyze Xerox's revenue by geographical areas, a huge portion of its Services earnings is derived from the US. Essentially, they have not proven their ability to consistently win new contracts and grow revenue in that geographical base. If we assume the boost from new contracts related to Obamacare legislation has come and gone, there seems to be no big catalyst on the horizon to bolster its stagnant Services revenue.As for DT margins, the unexpected spike in 2014 is due to several one-time gains such as a lower bad debt expense, pension costs and other factors rather than an improvement in operational efficiency. Generally, DT margins have remained stable over the past few years, which is encouraging as it indicates Xerox is able to keep up technologically with its competitors. However, management recognizes that DT is a mature business with no real potential for growth, and hence this segment has become increasingly sidelined in favor of developing the Services busness. Hence, stable DT margins is not exactly a big positive when viewed in tandem with weakening Services margins.How Much Of Cash Flow Is Really 'Free'?Whilst many articles mention Xerox's strong ability to generate free cash flow (see here and here), using FCF as an indicator of Xerox's earning ability is extremely misleading because expenses for acquisitions are excluded from CAPEX.Xerox makes acquisitions amounting to hundreds of millions a year, buying smaller companies to add to its array of technology, patents and intellectual property. This is essentially 'buying R&D' instead of increasing expenses for organic R&D. However, since acquisition expenses are not included CAPEX, the free cash flow figure becomes disproportionately high. This causes many investors to fall into a trap when they fail to recognize that the money spent investing for future revenue is much higher than what the CAPEX figure would suggest.Hence, to reach a more accurate amount of how much of Xerox's cash flow is really 'free', we have to factor in the acquisition expenses every year. This brings Xerox's free cash flow for 2014 from $1.72B to $1.35B.The $1.18B figure is far more indicative of how much free cash the company is really generating. Thus, Xerox's free cash flow figures overstate the true amount of ""free cash"" that the company is generating. Indeed, $1.35B is still an extremely impressive number, but investors need to be aware that operating cash flows have been declining since 2012.Why Have Xerox Shares Rallied since 2012?Since 2012, both net income and OCF have declined steadily, while Xerox's share price has rallied in that same period. This reveals a simple but important fact: the increase in share price is not a reflection of growing earnings or cash flow, it is entirely due to the market assigning a higher PE and P/OCF ratio.We believe this is already a clear indication that Xerox is not a strong buy. With a rising valuation but no earnings or cash flow growth to back it up, Xerox has weak long-term prospects and is not suitable for the long-term value investor.Contract Renewal and SigningsThe Total Contract Value of signings has fluctuated significantly since 2012 as Xerox has not demonstrated its ability to grow gain profitable deals from its pipeline. In essence, the above chart demonstrates why Xerox is no longer a growth company, and accordingly a lower P/E multiple should be accorded to account for the stagnant growth.Moreover, the unstable BPO renewal rate indicates that management has not developed Xerox's ability to retain contracts on a consistent basis. The recent loss of the Texas Medicaid contract resulted in the renewal rate plunging to 82% from 93% in the past year. Furthermore, even though management has given guidance that they expect the renewal rate to be maintained between 85% to 90%, the actual figures have broken the lower end of guidance far too many times in the previous years to lend any credibility to their projections. In essence, when it comes to retaining contracts, Xerox's performance is not good enough.Structural InefficienciesWhen we first began looking at Xerox, we noticed a disturbing figure in terms of how many employees that have for a part-consulting, part-IT manufacturing business. In fact, compared to its closest peers, Xerox's net income and revenue per employee lags behind significantly.Taken on its own, Xerox's net income per revenue has also been falling significantly since 2011. These findings suggest there is too much fat in the staggeringly large workforce, and management is not improving labor efficiency to achieve a higher return on its employees. Since 2010, the workforce has ballooned from 136.5k to 147.5k direct employees, while cash flow and earnings growth has remained stagnant. It suggests that Xerox has not been successful in moving away from labour-intensive parts of its business to focus on the higher-value services that require lesser overall employees, but more skilled employees. Ironically, for a company that prides itself on making other businesses more efficient, Xerox needs to review its own labour efficiency.These structural inefficiencies not only lead to a lower return for shareholders, but a larger number of direct employees now will inevitably leave a legacy of higher pension and health benefit costs later on. These structural problems are stickier than the ordinary industry headwinds or forex fluctuations. Management needs to streamline the workforce and focus on parts of the business that are scalable without increasing labor needs dramatically. In that aspect, management has been failing.Pension & Health Benefit ExpensesBeing an extremely labor-intensive company, Xerox incurs a large cash expense on pension and health benefits every year. These expenses are a legacy from the past decades and are unlikely to decrease significantly anytime soon. Although management has previously implemented freezes in 2011 and 2012 to prevent escalating pension and health benefit costs, costs not expected to come down in the near future as current changes largely affect current employees who will retire much later. As a result, we expect Xerox to continue incurring these expenses for an extended period of time, and this acts as a drag on earnings.We believe these expenses are often overlooked and are a hidden risk to shareholder returns. Furthermore, Xerox has over $3.6B in unfunded pension and health benefit liabilities, and this amount could become even higher if their actuarial assumptions prove wrong (forecasting bias). The downside risk is definitely increased with the $3.6B bomb dangling over Xerox.Share Buybacks, DividendsOne of Xerox's bright spots is its extremely shareholder friendly policy. Management has committed to return over 50% of free cash flow to shareholders every year in the form of share buybacks and dividends. For the past few years, Xerox has been consistently buying back over $1B in shares annually and allocating over $300M for dividends. Hence, there is no denying this is a strong catalyst for the stock to move up. However, recognize that these large buybacks are made in the context of a company whose earnings and cash flow is declining and stagnant at best. Therefore, while Xerox is not exactly a profitable, growing company, its stock could be attractive given the buybacks and dividends.However, this isn't exactly an advantage unique to Xerox. IBM (NYSE:IBM), which we think is Xerox's closest peer, has a long-standing share buyback policy that is even more robust. Arguably, IBM has a wider moat and better prospects than Xerox, along with shareholder-friendly policies like dividend growth and share buybacks. Yet, IBM trades at a slightly lower P/E of 14.4 compared to Xerox's 15.1. When viewed in that context, Xerox is far too expensive for our liking.Even if we regard Xerox's current price as a discount to fair value, it is far better to buy a great company at fair value than a not-so-good company at a discount. Thus, Xerox is certainly not a worthy long-term addition to a value investor's portfolio.ConclusionWhile this may be a strong characterization, we think Xerox is a value trap. The artificially high free cash flow figures present a far rosier picture of the company than what it actually is. There are lingering structural inefficiencies and management has largely failed to optimize returns. Although the share price may experience a temporary bounce as a reaction to the recent fall, we believe Xerox is not a good addition to a long-term value investor's portfolio."
2676235,25341,2014-11-13T23:42:47-05:00,Xerox is committed to return half of its free cash flow to investors.The company's growth has slowed down but it is making a transition.The current valuation doesn't account for any growth.,"Note: All the facts and figures in this article were taken from Xerox's annual investors conference documents posted in the company's investor relations website.On Tuesday, Xerox (NYSE:XRX) held its annual investor conference which received mixed reaction from the investors. The company's long-term guidance was within range of what analysts were looking for and it announced a large buyback of $1.5 billion, which is enough to capture 10% of the existing shares.The company's future guidance or vision had a lot of solid targets and if these targets are met or exceeded, the investors will not be terribly disappointed. For example, the company expects to generate about two thirds of its revenues from services by 2017. Services is a growing market that carries higher margins than the hardware market and Xerox definitely intends to take advantage of this opportunity. As a result of this shift and better cost-structure, the company expects to improve its services margin by roughly 50 basis points. Furthermore, the company expects to generate $2 billion of cash from its operations by next year and it expects to return half of its free cash flow (not the same thing as cash from operations) to investors in shape of dividends and share buybacks. The management seems to think that these goals are reachable as well as sustainable.Currently, roughly 60% of the revenues come from services while the document technology segment (the traditional part of the company that sells printers and printing supplies) generates 40% of the revenues. In the future, services revenues are expected to rise faster than document technology revenues as the former is expected to grow around 6-7% annually while the latter grows around 4-6% annually. This will allow for the services business to take a larger piece of the revenue pie as time goes on. Since the services segment relies on recurring revenues, this is a more desirable business for the company. Also, due to the nature of its business model, the hardware business is much more sensitive to the global economic conditions and increasing competition than the services business.In the recent years, black-and-white printer sales have been weak but high-end printers that can print in color are gaining ground and these printers tend to have better margins than traditional printers. Year-to-date, Xerox's printing business carried a segment margin of 13.6%, up from last year's 10.8% and 2012's 11.3%. Part of this was due to a shift from black-and-white printers to color-printers and part of it came from improved operational efficiencies. Xerox launches 23 new products in the first 10 months of this year and most of the new products are high-end color printers, which should help the company's margins more.Still, the company's services segment could have performed better than how it performed so far in 2014. Year-to-date, new business signings is down 6% despite a 7% larger pipeline compared to last year. The company seemingly had a lot of trouble with converting much of its pipeline into contracts. Also, the renewal rate plunged to 75% from 2013's 92%. The big plunge was mostly due to loss of one big client (Texas MMIS), but even excluding that, the renewal rate was 86%, still significantly down from 2013. The company's long-term renewal rate goal for this business segment is 85-90%. To make the matters worse, the margins of the segment continued to fall after falling from 10.2% to 9.8% last year. Year-to-date, the segment margins are at 8.7% and the trend looks alarming. The company blamed Obamacare and its restructuring efforts for the worsening margins but it promised that things would get better once some of the recent investments start paying-off. In 2015, Xerox expects its services margins to range between 9% and 10%.During the next year, the company's capital allocation will look a little different than how it looked last year and this year. In 2015, the company doesn't plan on reducing its debt-level as it believes that its current debt level is manageable and allows it to allocate capital to other places where investors will see more value for their money. In 2013, $296 million was spent on dividends and the company will have spent $300 million by the end of this year as well as end of 2015 for the same purpose. This doesn't mean that dividend payments will not grow though. Since the share count will be lower due to the company's repurchase activities, dividend-per-share will increase slightly despite the company spending the same amount of money to pay dividends. The company will spend $500 million on share repurchases next year after spending $1 billion this year. Also, $500 million will be spent on acquisitions, mostly for the company's services segment, and another $300 million is allocated for what the company calls ""opportunistic"" investments. These figures exclude about $250-300 million of cash that will be allocated for the company's pension commitments and pension related settlements.Xerox is a shareholder-friendly company that is pretty good at leveraging its assets and generating cash flow. On the other hand, the company's growth has slowed down big time and it is trying to make up for it by purchasing its own shares. The company has a long history of innovation, and its portfolio of products and services keep seeing more than 20 additions every year. The company is expected to earn around $1.13-1.15 this year and next year. This means that Xerox is currently trading at roughly 11 times its forward earnings. The valuation is just right if we count Xerox as a ""non-growth company"" but it would be considered ""too cheap to ignore"" if we counted it as a ""growth company."" Even though the company's growth has slowed down, we can't talk about a decline in earnings either. Xerox will continue to generate healthy amounts of cash and return a good chunk of this cash to its shareholders as long as the current management stays at the company."
2841626,24105,2015-01-23T13:41:06-05:00,Properly analyzed the Xerox balance sheet has zero net debt.Xerox trades at 7.3 times owner's cash flow.Xerox will benefit from earnings tailwinds in the form of share repurchases and lower interest payments.Xerox is misunderstood because earnings are much less than cash flow and the balance sheet contains hidden assets.Xerox should trade at 10 times owner's cash flow which would produce a price 39% higher than Wednesday's close.,"I wrote about Xerox (NYSE:XRX) two years ago in this article when it was trading at $6.69 and still consider it to be attractive for value investors. Wednesday, it closed at $13.58 and it currently pays a 25 cent per share dividend. It recently sold a division for $1 billion and appears to have bought back $1 billion worth of its own stock in 2014.Balance Sheet - I think that XRX tends to be misunderstood for several reasons, one of which is the balance sheet. A cursory glance at the balance sheet (based on the most recent quarterly financials filed with the SEC) reveals $1 billion in cash and $7.7 billion in debt. I focus on net debt (debt minus cash) and so I would ordinarily assume that net debt was $6.7 billion. However, XRX is a company which finances the sale of its own equipment and carries financing receivables on its balance sheet. Thus, XRX is actually in the financial business as well as the equipment and business service businesses. It makes perfect sense for XRX to borrow against these receivables. The receivables are constantly reviewed for loan loss potential and write downs are taken when appropriate. The $4.3 billion in XRX financing receivables should be offset against gross debt to calculate net debt. When added to balance sheet cash, the value of interest in an affiliate and the $1 billion realized after the end of the quarter by the sale of a line of business, the offsets equal the debt and net debt winds up at zero. I think that this analysis is legitimate in part because financing receivables can be converted into cash (as XRX has done in the past), and are assets which could be sold without adversely affecting the core business. This is not a case in which XRX has simply classified normal receivables as financing receivables. XRX has a separate balance sheet item for accounts receivable and that account is actually much larger than accounts payable. Thus, there is no sign that XRX is somehow moving ordinary short-term receivables into the financing receivables category.Owner's Cash Flow - I tend to focus on ""owner's cash flow"" which is a loose measure of the amount of cash available for dividends and share repurchases. It is an approximation of the amount of cash that would be available annually to an individual if he or she owned the entire company. I calculate owner's cash flow adding after tax earnings, depreciation and amortization and subtracting capital expenditures. This calculation is somewhat similar to the ""funds from operations"" metric used on equity REITs. I have generally favored companies trading at less than 10 times owner's cash flow. In the case of XRX, I have taken the numbers for the first nine months of 2014 and annualized them. Thus, I have added earnings of $830 million and depreciation and amortization of $1,070 million and subtracted capital expenditures of $277 million to get owners cash flow of $1633 million for the nine months or an annualized $2,177. Since XRX has zero net debt, I have simply used market cap ($15.78 billion) to calculate the ratio of 7.3. This is one of the lowest ratios I have seen recently and it is similar to the low ratios of stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) when they were about to shoot up in price. XRX is like a REIT which is trading at 7.3 times FFO, an extraordinarily low valuation. One way to think about this is that XRX is producing an owner's cash flow yield of 13.7%. Thus, XRX can use 4% of its cash for dividends, use another 5% for share repurchases and still have 4.7% left at the end of the year. XRX is paying a low dividend at this time but that may change. It also has a large share repurchase program. A 13.7% owner's cash flow yield is extremely attractive in the current low yield environment.Tailwind #1 (Repurchases) - As noted above, in its last conference call, XRX noted that it planned to buy back a total of $1 billion worth of stock in 2014 (as of the end of the third quarter it had bought back roughly $730 million worth). In the first nine months of 2014, XRX reduced share count by nearly 5% and it was doubtlessly knocked down further (probably nearly an additional 2%) in the fourth quarter. Share repurchases financed by cash flow add no costs to the company so that the same operational numbers produce more earnings per share due to the reduced share count. We may see this pattern emerge with XRX as it has with other high cash flow tech companies.Tailwind #2 (Lower Interest Expenses) - XRX has some debt which it incurred in the past and is still on its books at high interest rates. Its most recent annual report reveals substantial amounts of debt at interest rates of 9.0%, 8.25% and 7.2 %. Recently, XRX has been able to borrow at rates as low as 2.8%. As the old high cost debt matures (I assume that XRX is not able to prepay at attractive terms) it will be replaced by much lower cost debt or simply retired by cash flow and total debt reduction. In any case, interest expense should experience a long-term decline.Why XRX Is Misunderstood - I always prefer to have some idea of why a company is not trading at levels inconsistent with my valuation. In this case, I think that there are several reasons. First of all, the earnings of XRX do not really give a good indication of cash flow. Depreciation and amortization are huge non-cash charges against earnings and are much larger than capital expenditures. I have seen this situation with a number of large tech companies and it can lead to depressed share prices but it is almost always corrected as the share price increases. The second factor is the balance sheet confusion described above. Actual net debt is really a lot lower than the net debt sometimes presented in financial calculations. Finally, XRX is still thought of as a company which manufactures copiers. In fact, it is now primarily a business service company with a more stable cash flow, relatively ""sticky"" client relationships and less potential for ruinous price competition.Conclusion - I think a conservative valuation for XRX would be 10 times owners cash flow (as calculated above). This would produce a share price of $18.75 or a 39% increase from the present level."

        According to the ModernGraham valuation model, the company is undervalued at the present time.
        The market is implying only 3.06% earnings growth over the next 7-10 years, considerably lower than the rate the company has seen in recent years.","Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) should attract investors initially because of its consistent earnings growth over the last several years. However, Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, taught that the most important aspect to consider is whether the company is trading at a discount relative to its intrinsic value. It is through a thorough fundamental analysis that the investor is able to make a determination about a potential investment's merits. Here is a look at how Xerox Corporation fares in the ModernGraham valuation model.The model is inspired by the teachings of Benjamin Graham, and considers numerous metrics intended to help the investor reduce risk levels. The first part of the analysis is to determine whether the company is suitable for the very conservative Defensive Investor or the less conservative Enterprising Investor, who is willing to spend a greater amount of time conducting further research.In addition, Graham strongly suggested that investors avoid speculation, in order to remove the subjective elements of emotion. This is best achieved by utilizing a systematic approach to analysis that will provide investors with a sense of how a specific company compares to another company. By using the ModernGraham method, one can review a company's historical accomplishments and determine an intrinsic value that can be compared across industries.XRX data by YChartsDefensive Investor - Must pass at least 6 of the following 7 tests: Score = 4/7Enterprising Investor - Must pass at least 4 of the following 5 tests or be suitable for a defensive investor: Score = 3/5Valuation SummaryKey DataBalance Sheet - September 2014Earnings Per ShareEarnings Per Share - ModernGrahamDividend HistoryXRX Dividend data by YChartsConclusion:After reviewing the data, it is clear that conservative value investors may wish to seek other opportunities. The Defensive Investor is concerned with the low current ratio, short dividend history, insufficient earnings growth over the last ten years, and high PEmg and PB ratios, while the Enterprising Investor has concerns with the high level of debt relative to the current assets. As a result, both investor types would find the company to be too risky to proceed. That said, any investor willing to speculate about the future of the company may go ahead with the next step of the analysis, which is a determination of the company's intrinsic value.When calculating an estimate of intrinsic value, it is important to consider the historical earnings results, along with the market's implied estimate for future growth. Here, the company has grown its EPSmg (normalized earnings) from $0.58 in 2010 to an estimated $0.93 for 2014. This level of demonstrated growth is fairly strong, and significantly higher than the market's implied estimate of only 3.06%. As a result, Xerox Corporation appears to be significantly undervalued at the present time."
2517585,21798,2014-09-24T10:15:09-04:00,"Xerox has successfully transformed itself, but needs to increase revenue for the long-term.The stock is attractively undervalued relative to the S&P 500.The stock is likely to see gains over the next year on earnings growth.","Xerox (NYSE:XRX) has been in the process of reinventing itself over the years. The company was previously known for primarily producing copiers and other business equipment. However, Xerox has transformed into an information technology services company, similar to the way IBM Corporation (NYSE:IBM) has transformed. Services now comprise 57% of Xerox's revenue. Both companies have struggled to grow revenue in 2012, 2013, and again this year. That could be the result of the highly competitive nature of the information services industry. Xerox will need to find a way to increase revenue again to support earnings growth over the long-term.Xerox's stock has had a good run for most of 2014, rising from about $10 to around $14. This performance was supported as the company exceeded earnings estimates for the past two quarters. Xerox is expected to increase revenue slightly next year over this year's expected revenue. However, next year's expected revenue of $21.22 billion is still lower than the revenue of $21.6 billion back in 2010. The stock should perform well if revenue continues to increase to support increased earnings growth over the long run.Xerox still sells business equipment such as printers, copiers, and scanners. However, the company also now handles services that we use daily and perhaps take for granted. For example, Xerox handles toll-road and municipal parking transactions. The company also handles the filing of medical claims, paying bills, and the mortgage application process. Xerox handles information technology to improve other businesses' daily operations in various industries such as: energy, education, government, healthcare, manufacturing, insurance, transportation, and retail. The company's growth going forward is likely to come from various services in these industries.Strength in ValuationCurrently, the stock is undervalued as compared to the S&P 500. Xerox is trading at 11.4X next year's expected earnings, while the S&P 500 is trading at 16.9X next year's expected earnings. The company is also undervalued as compared to the Information Technology Services industry which is trading with a forward PE of 12.2. Investors are giving Xerox a below average valuation mostly likely because revenue has declined for the past few years. However, if the company can meet/exceed its earnings estimates over the next year, I think that the stock is likely to increase from these valuation levels. Xerox has met/exceeded its earnings estimates for the past four quarters. If the company can achieve this for the next four quarters, then the stock should perform well.Prospects for GrowthXerox is banking on Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) and document outsourcing for revenue growth going forward. These businesses have higher growth rates than the Information Technology Outsourcing (ITO) business. Therefore, Xerox sees BPO and document outsourcing as the driver of revenue growth for the future. Currently, Xerox is expected to achieve revenue of $21.12 billion for 2014 and $21.22 billion for 2015. This is lower than last year's revenue of $21.44 billion. The company can get by with this stagnant revenue growth through 2015 by focusing on higher margin businesses and cutting costs to increase earnings. However, the company needs to increase revenue growth to support earnings growth for the long-term.Earnings are expected to increase by 1.8% this year and 8.1% next year. The company's current undervaluation should allow the stock to increase approximately by 8.8% (2015 EPS of $1.20/price of $13.65) over the next year if earnings expectations are met. If the company exceeds expectations for most of its quarters over this time, then I would expect the results to be even better. Xerox also rewards shareholders with a modest dividend of 1.9%."
2357655,69395,2014-07-30T09:39:30-04:00,Now is a good time to review my investment thesis for Xerox from a value standpoint.Here I'll provide a description and views on main business units.The attractiveness of the valuation from an absolute value perspective is apparent.,"Investment ThesisXerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) is increasingly a business services company. The printer business (""Document Technology"") is an ex-growth cash cow and will continue to generate cash for a long time. It is attractively priced in absolute terms, and has a shareholder-friendly strategy of returning capital through dividends and buybacks.Investment Thesis ReviewServices Business: The Services Segment grew revenues 3% in 2013 and now represents 55% of total revenues. Its contribution at the PBT level is even higher. Some of the increase in contribution is due to the fact that Document Technology shrank slightly, but as long as the overall profitability remains stable to slightly improving, the revenue quality of the overall business is improving - which is a positive.2009-13 Services Segment RevenueSource: Xerox Annual Report.This segment is an attractive business composed of Business Process Outsourcing (59% of Services revenue), IT Outsourcing (13% of Services revenue) and Document Outsourcing (28% of Services revenue). These are long-term contracts with high renewal rates (85-90%) and the company has a strong pipeline of new opportunities. Document Outsourcing (managed printing services, or ""print as a service"" if you want to be promotional) is probably a lower quality business, but the company is incredibly well positioned here given its legacy. It is also worth noting that other outsourced printing companies such as Vistaprint (VPRT) trade at very rich multiples (11x LTM EBITDA and 30x LTM P/E - although to be fair, FY1 multiples look decent if they achieve the growth at 8.3x EBITDA and 14x P/E).Document Technology: The Document Technology segment shrank by 6% in 2013, and profitability fell to $966m (9% below 2012), almost as low as it was in 2009. I am still of the view that the era of the ""paperless office"" is still a long way away, so I think this profit stream will continue to be sustainable for a long time. It's certainly not a growing market, but it is a market that needs to be served and few serve it better than Xerox.Attractive Absolute Valuation: Maybe the below will sound like a contradiction to what I previously wrote on the bias of cost basis, but I think it is more about ""knowing where you stand"" than anything else. Here are some key valuation metrics for Xerox with the change in the metric since my last review of this position (Nov. 4, 2013, which was when I bought the shares) in parenthesis.EPS: $0.92 (+0.2%)Price/LTM Earnings: 14.2x (+32%)Price/FY1 Earnings: 12.0x (+27%)EV/LTM EBITDA: 8.2x (+17%)EV/FY1 EBITDA: 6.7x (+11%)EV/Revenues: 1.1x (+20%)EV/FY1 Revenues: 1.1x (+17%)Source: Company filings and CapitalIQ.At first glance, it looks like the valuation part of the investment thesis is poorer across the board now - by about 20%. One the one hand, this is a nice problem to have and one that should hopefully be a recurring one for any value investor. On the other hand, it would be preferable for the near 30% price appreciation experienced to date to be a result of an improving business, rather than a richer valuation. In any event, the valuation remains attractive on an absolute basis. At a 12x forward P/E, the implied earnings yield is over 8%. That is a very acceptable base case, and there is a lot of optionality here with valuation re-rating (there is a long way to go before getting to ""market"" levels) and some growth in the long term once the slow decline of the Document Technology business settles.The dividend yield has now fallen below 2%, but I would not be surprised to see the company raise its dividend at some point. The share repurchasing has been aggressive, which is the right thing to do with a depressed valuation. It would be nice to see a shift in favor of more dividends and less repurchases if the valuation continues to increase at this rate.Shareholder-Friendly Strategy: One of the first thing that attracted me to Xerox was that it had a decent dividend yield. I see that as a sign of sensible valuation (assuming it's sustainable) and a shareholder-friendly management. Combined with the aggressive share repurchase program, it is very clear that the management has a strategy of returning capital to shareholders. The chart below compares cash flow from operations to the major uses of cash for the last five years.2009-14 Cash from Operations and Its UsesSource: Company filings and Capital IQ.With the exception of the large acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services (now known as Xerox Business Services), the company has had a moderate and disciplined M&A strategy. That acquisition bolstered the services business and seems to have been a good one. They do enough M&A that I have not had the time to analyze each one specifically, but given the company's heritage, it seems as if they are being appropriately opportunistic here. I like the optionality it creates.Other Considerations: The company makes a lot out of their ""Annuity-Based Business Model"" (now 84% of revenues). I certainly like that about the business model in general - recurring revenues are a nice thing. It strikes me as a bit promotional, despite the fact that I think it is true. I wonder if it is a legacy of the printer business where selling the ink cartridges was always where all the money was made - one of the real classic ""razor/razor blade"" business models.ConclusionThe original investment thesis still holds and this investment should stay in the portfolio (which is good, since it has only been nine months). This is a nice business worth owning for the long term. Given current valuation and profitability, I would expect it to generate an overall return of about 100% over the next 10 years (implied by 8% earnings yield, assuming a bit of degradation), which would be a good outcome.In more general terms, I think this is a decent investment to hold in the event of a downturn. The printers business could surely suffer, but the services business should be resilient. There are some concerns around the consumer financing (the company lends people money to buy its products) to which most of the debt is related, but the balance sheet is strong and credits should be fairly safe.Disclosure: The author is long XRX.

The year-over-year decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to a decline in revenues. Total revenue of $5.3 billion was down 2 percent or 3 percent in constant currency. Revenue from the company's Services business, which represented 57 percent of total revenue, was $3.0 billion, up 2 percent year-over-year or 1 percent in constant currency.

The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was at 8.1%, and over the past five years was at 4.8%.Source: Charles SchwabSince the company generates lots of cash and the payout ratio is very low, there is a good chance that the company will continue to raise its dividend payment.The company generated $325 million in cash flow from operations during the second quarter and $611 million for the first half of 2014. In the second quarter, Xerox repurchased $204 million in stock and $479 million in the first half of the year.

With that said, I wanted to take a closer look and share my thoughts on what needs to happen in order for Xerox (NYSE:XRX) to deliver a fairly solid quarter when the company announces its results on July 25.Company OverviewHeadquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut, Xerox has been a leader in document technology and services and continues to build on its heritage of innovation. The company is now the world's leading enterprise for business process and document management, offering global services from claims reimbursement and automated toll transaction to customer care centers and HR benefits management.Recent Trend BehaviorOn Wednesday, shares of XRX, which currently possess a market cap of $14.92 billion, a forward P/E ratio of 10.69, and a dividend yield of 1.96% ($0.25), settled at a price of $12.78/share. Based on a closing price of $12.78/share, shares of XRX are trading 1.69% above their 20-day simple moving average, 3.06% above their 50-day simple moving average, and 12.40% above their 200-day simple moving average.Although these numbers indicate both a short and long term uptrend for the stock, which generally translates into a buying mode for most near-term traders and many long-term investors, I strongly believe the company's trend behavior will continue well into the second half of the year when it announces Q2 results on July 25.Upcoming Earnings OutlookWhen it comes to the company's upcoming Q2 earnings, there are a number of things potential investors should consider. For instance, analysts are currently calling for XRX to earn $0.26/share in terms of EPS (which is $0.01/share lower than what the company had reported during Q1 2014, and $0.01/share lower than what the company had reported during the year-ago period) and $5.31 billion in terms of revenue when its latest earnings are released on July 25.In order to meet and/or exceed its quarterly EPS estimates, I'd like to see a 2%-to-4% increase in the company's Q2 operating profit (as compared to Q1's operating profit of $442 million), a 2%-to-5% increase in the company's Q2 cash flow from operations (as compared to Q1's cash flow from operations of $286 million) and lastly, a 3%-to-5% increase in the company's revenues (as compared to Q1's revenues of $5.1 billion).Xerox's Latest Acquisition Could Boost Service Ops RevenuesOn May 28, Xerox announced that it would be buying ISG Holdings, the parent of two companies - StrataCare and Bunch CareSolutions - for $225M in cash. StrataCare provides medical bill review and claims management software/services, and Bunch's offerings cover bill review, claims, nurse care management, insurance network management, and analytics, among other things. The good thing about this acquisition, in my opinion, is the fact that it will boost Xerox's revenues, 57% of which were generated by the company's service ops segment.ConclusionFor those of you who may be considering a long-term position in Xerox, I'd actually recommend to keep a closer eye on the recent acquisition of ISG Holdings over the next 6-12 months and its impact on the company's overall revenue growth. In terms of the company's upcoming quarter, steady increases of at least 2% in the company's operating profits as well as a solid increase of at least 3% in terms of its revenues could help XRX meet or even surpass analysts' expectations when it announces earnings on July 25.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company also guided 3Q in line with consensus and the low end of full year 2014 guidance was boosted from $1.07 a share to $1.09.

Xerox Corporation just reported its preliminary financial results based on which we provide a unique corporate earnings release based analysis of its performance. Our analysis focuses on the company’s performance for the same quarterly period on a year-on-year basis (unless stated otherwise). This earnings release follows the earnings announcements from the following peers of Xerox Corporation – Lexmark International, Inc. Class A (NYSE:LXK) and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM).HighlightsThe table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income (See complete table at the end of this report):Revenue Growth Versus Earnings Growth  Companies sometimes focus on growing their top-line (Sales or Revenues) more than their bottom-line i.e., Earnings or Net Income. Investors should look at revenue growth to understand a company’s ability to grow its market share, and earnings growth to look at the company’s ability to generate returns. Comparing revenue growth to earnings growth helps understand a couple of items: (1) A company’s focus on gaining market share vs. generating profits and (2) How additive or dilutive the revenue performance has been to earnings. XRX-US’ year-on-year change in top line compared to the same period last year of -2.70% is better than its change in earnings, which was -7.29% – suggesting perhaps that the company’s focus is on the top-line at the expense of bottom-line earnings. But more critically, this top-line performance is among the lowest thus far in its sector – inviting the potential of loss in market share as well this period. Also, for comparison purposes, revenues changed by -3.25% and earnings by -1.11% compared to the immediate last quarter.Earnings Growth Analysis The company's year-on-year decline in earnings has been influenced by the following factors: (1) Decline in gross margins from 36.43% to 35.92% and (2) issues with cost controls. As a result, operating margins (EBITDA margins) went from 14.92% to 14.65% in this period. For comparison, gross margins were 35.87% and EBITDA margins 15.38% in the immediate last quarter.Gross Margin TrendCompanies sometimes trade-off for improvements in revenues and margins by extending friendlier terms to customers and vendors. One quick way to check against such activity is to compare the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is quite possible that the company’s performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply a prop up using the balance sheet. The company’s decline in gross margins is compounded by issues on the balance sheet side – there has been deterioration in working capital levels. The company’s working capital days have gone up to 39.71 from 37.45 for the same period last year.Operating Cash Flow Growth Versus Earnings GrowthCompanies often post earnings numbers that are influenced by non-cash activities. One way to gauge the quality of the declared earnings number is to judge the deviation in the growth in earnings from the growth in operating cash flows. In general, an earnings growth rate that is higher compared to the operating cash flow growth implies a higher proportion of non-operating and even one-time activities – such activities are typically not sustainable over long periods. XRX-US’ year-on-year change in Operating Cash Flow of -38.09% trailed its change in earnings suggesting that the earnings number might have benefited from some unlocking of accruals. In addition, this change in Operating Cash Flow is less than the average among the declared results thus far in its peer group.Unusual ItemsThe company’s decline in earnings has been influenced by the following factors: (1) Decline in EBIT margins from 8.46% to 7.83% and (2) unusual items that decreased pretax margins from 6.37% to 5.86%.Supporting DataThe table below shows the preliminary results along with the recent trend for revenues, net income and other relevant metrics:Company ProfileXerox Corp. provides business process and information technology outsourcing, and document management services.

However, a few companies could offer more upside than the iPhone maker. To find these stocks, investors have to look for stocks that are unloved and out of favor. One of the best areas is turnaround stocks.Turnarounds by ""old"" tech stocks are possible; Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) is doing a pretty good job, with shares up over 50% during the last twelve months.Xerox (NYSE:XRX) is another potential turnaround stock worth looking at, with the ultimate question being, is Xerox a value trap?For starters, Xerox trades at a P/E ratio of 10.8, based on next year's earnings estimates. Compare that to Apple's 13.5. Xerox also trades very cheaply on a price-to-free cash flow basis. Its P/FCF ratio is only 7.4, while Apple trades at 16.Shares have been showing signs of life over the last twelve months as it keeps plugging away with its turnaround strategy. The stock is up nearly 40% over the last year.We're seeing marked improvement in its margins in the document technology business (includes supplies and hardware). Meanwhile, the services business is still seeing margin pressure. Despite the fact that margins are better in the document tech business, its revenues are in decline. The services business is where investors should be focused, as this segment will offset the decline in document technology.Xerox's ultimate plan is to move away from being a document-based company to one that is a high-margin outsourcing company.Xerox recently hired an IBM executive of 35 years to run its service business. This puts a renewed focus on the services business. The services segment accounted for 55% of revenues last year. That number should hit 66% (of total revenues) over the long term.Per an earnings call earlier this year, Xerox noted that it still plans on boosting margins by 50 basis points this year. The majority of that will come during the second half of the year. The easiest way for Xerox to boost margins in the services segment is to penetrate its current customer base deeper by offering more valued-added services.Over four years ago, Atlantic Investment Management was touting Xerox as a takeover target. Shares are still trading just around where they were back then. Atlantic was hopeful that IBM, HP or even Dell would buy Xerox. This didn't happen, and Atlantic no longer owns the stock, but with a market cap of $15 billion, it's not unreasonable that Xerox won't still be bought out.Barron's recently featured Xerox as one of its top 10 ways to play the M&A boom. The newspaper pointed out that Xerox is a beneficiary of technological change, rather than a victim of it, given the company gets 55% of revenues from outsourcing services. But it also noted that at ""a 2014 EV/EBITDA ratio of 6.6, Xerox is priced more like copier rival Canon, at 5.5, than outsourcing giant Accenture, at 9.7.""Xerox is a cash flow generating machine, and it plans to step up its share repurchases in an effort to reward shareholders. Xerox's free cash flow margin is over 15%, while Apple's is 6.4%. Assuming Xerox should trade in line with its five-year average P/E of 14, the upside is to $15, or around 20%. Longer term, it could trade closer to the industry average P/E ratio of 16.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2254283,66393,2014-06-05T07:36:32-04:00,"XRX has shifted its business model in attempts to realize higher margins and to de-lever.Lower leverage and higher gross margins will drive XRX's share price up in the coming year.Despite recent pullbacks, XRX shares are poised for strong near- and long-term price growth.","Xerox (NYSE:XRX), a household name since the early 20th century, has seen impressive growth over the last year. Since March of 2013, its equity value has increased by over 30%. Fundamental equity analysis places much importance on the ability of companies to sustainably grow free cash flows, therefore, heavy emphasis is placed on the analysis of Xerox's future cash flow prospects over the short- and long-term. The largest market movers (such as massive mutual funds and hedge funds) will often buy and hold equities that they believe have strong cash flow growth, making fundamental analysis an important tool in determining the true value of an equity.A significant shift in Xerox's business model drives its near-term and long-term growth. Up until recently, Xerox realized its main source of revenue from hardware sales. Xerox's photocopy machines and office equipment have dominated their respective markets since the late 20th century. However, changes in technology have seen a large phasing out of paper. This has hurt Xerox's business model in the past decade, and its stock price movement has reflected that. Before the tech bubble of 2000, Xerox's stock price had broken $60, and afterwards, it only regained momentum enough to almost break $20 in 2008, where it crashed again. Xerox has never really recovered, with its prices fluctuating between $5 and $10 since the 2008 crash. However, changes to its core operating model have allowed it to break $12 in the last year, and analysis shows that there is still much growth left to be captured in a potential long position.Up until last year, Xerox's 40% leverage has weighed down the company, meaning that 46% of its company value was derived from debt. Bleak hardware sales also contributed to low valuation, so the Xerox CEO decided that it was time to move into its secondary line of business, business process outsourcing. This arm of Xerox's business handles everything from finance and accounting outsourcing to document management, and serves a wide variety of industries. Xerox decided to leverage its pre-existing business relationships, strong brand, and technology to dominate this market. This segment has much higher profit margins than hardware, implying better cash flow generation and higher valuations. This shift in business will also directly affect its leverage, as the hardware segment is extremely capital-intensive, requiring Xerox to finance most of its hardware, which it in turn, sells to the customers. Essentially, Xerox used the customer's payments to pay off its own debt acquired from manufacturing the hardware. This type of debt accounted for 60% of Xerox's total debt, implying that Xerox was only truly ~16% leveraged (40% of its 40% leverage). Xerox's shift into a new line of business allows steady de-levering. Xerox now only realizes 30% leverage, down over 25% from what it was last year. Recently, Xerox's price has seen some turmoil with regards to lawsuits and missed earnings. However, the potential for strong earnings and cash flow growth over the rest of this year still exists, as Xerox focuses most of its outsourcing business on the healthcare sector. The Affordable Care Act has catalyzed this outsourcing market with potential for the most growth. Higher margins and lower leverage will cause the value of Xerox's equity to theoretically increase, according to fundamental finance. The prospects for one or both of these factors to hold true with Xerox are very good.Analysis of Trading Multiples and Relative ValueTo affirm a hypothesis of undervaluation, an analysis of Xerox's fair value relative to how the market is trading was performed. The following price multiples were analyzed- Price-to-Earnings (12 months forward and trailing 12 months) and Price-to-Sales. This analysis gives a good picture of how relatively ""expensive"" the stock is. In each of these metrics, Xerox is undervalued relative to its competitors. Two Enterprise Value ratios- EV/Revenue and EV/EBIDTA were also analyzed. EV ratios give a good snapshot of how well a company is producing revenues and cash flows relative to how expensive it is, while also taking debt into the picture. Xerox is theoretically overvalued in these two metrics, due to high leverage. Enterprise value encompasses debt, so by nature, companies with less debt will have more attractive EV multiples. Xerox has more leverage than most of its competitors, so this is affirmed. We believe that if Xerox continues to morph its business model, it will continue to de-lever, driving its EV ratios lower and causing it to potentially trade at a more attractive valuation. The last ratio analyzed was Enterprise Value-to-Free Cash Flow. Since free cash flow is a pinnacle of fundamental analysis, an analysis of how expensive each dollar of free cash flow was for Xerox relative to its competitors was performed. In this metric, Xerox seems undervalued. As a fundamental investor, one seeks to purchase free cash flows cheaper than their fair value. Since Xerox is expected to increase its free cash flows significantly and given that it trades at about 25% cheaper FCF than its peers, Xerox could be great buy for the fundamental long investor. By analyzing our range of implied prices, we determined a fair value of $14.28.Source: Matoaka Capital LLC, Yahoo! FinanceXerox has remained versatile in a shifting marketplace by drastically changing its business model to adapt to new conditions. By pursuing a line of business that yields higher margins and requires less leverage, Xerox will continue to see strong share price growth in the coming years.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Buying because you’re hoping for a takeover, of course, doesn’t make much sense. And as cheap as Xerox shares seem, investors should be warned that the company’s business – outsourcing services for government and industry, followed by its historical copy sales and services – is at best sliding sideways and may be resistant to radical improvement.Since Xerox CEO Ursula Burns in 2009 engineered the $5.6 billion acquisition of outsourcing giant Affiliated Computer Services, Xerox is blessedly a lot less reliant on copiers. But the acquisition refocused the company on a low-margin, people-intensive industry and despite several rounds of layoffs, the payroll remains daunting; its 141,400 workers, as of March 31, roughly equal to the population of Kansas City, Kansas.XRX Total Employees (Annual) data by YChartsIn 2012, there was a restructuring charge to get rid of 6,300 employees. In 2013, charges were recorded to send another 4,900 on their way. And already this year, a program to reduce the workforce by 1,250 was instituted. But it remains a people-intensive business, processing healthcare claims for insurers and others and running call centers.The good news is Xerox’s revenue if largely recurring – annuity, in company-speak – with a 91% renewal rate on existing contracts in the first quarter of 2014. The bad news is getting paid more and signing of new clients is tough, so revenue has been sliding sideways at best. Maintaining profit margins in that environment is rough enough.XRX Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsThere’s about $8 billion in debt, so any takeover using borrowed funds would involve high levels of leverage.Burns, the CEO, is shareholder friendly, recently boosting the dividend – though the dividend yield, at 2%, is nothing to write home about -- and focusing on buybacks. Overall, the shareholder yield is above 9%.XRX Dividend data by YChartsAbsent a takeover, it’s a long-term play – and hardly an exciting one – that involves watching management turn every screw a quarter turn tighter. And then doing it again.Disclosure: None"
2260173,56142,2014-06-09T18:33:11-04:00,"Using 2007 as a proxy valuation, a low-$20s Xerox stock price projection is not out of the question for 2015 when measured against Wall Street's estimated 2014 financial results.The world’s largest and most successful hedge fund companies have been increasing their Xerox ownership stakes in 2013-14.At the present $13 share quote, Xerox is trading at 5.5x annual cash flow and a little over 6x free cash flow.","Xerox (NYSE:XRX) has reentered the Victory Formation system's Top 10 buy ideas in the past few days. While only a small number of investors were interested in Xerox's business future and steady cash flows during 2012, the last 18 months have witnessed a strong rise in the stock price and investor curiosity. With a stock quote climbing from the dead in 2012 (and absurdly low fundamental valuations), more and more smart investors are realizing Xerox's stable and growing cash flows per share, in fact, are worth owning.Some of the world's largest and most successful hedge fund companies have been increasing their Xerox ownership stakes in 2013-2014, including the likes of Bridgewater Associates (Ray Dalio), Citadel (Ken Griffin), Tudor Investments (Paul Tudor Jones) and Gotham Asset (Joel Greenblatt).I wrote about Xerox's unloved cash flow in a Seeking Alpha article earlier in the year here. The story explores a list of stock investments with plenty of upside potential for long-term value hunters. Xerox's strengthening balance sheet, growing business reach, leading brand name products in high-speed copiers and database, digital document, and information technology (IT) management are worthy of investor consideration.Beside the world-class leading Xerox copier and printer business, Xerox has been aggressively moving into IT, digital document storage and higher growth service-focused divisions for many years. For example, Xerox units are gaining business from Obamacare and other government healthcare initiatives by processing Medicaid documents for the states of California and New York, and workers compensation related data for the insurance industry. Xerox has 140,000-plus employees worldwide selling copiers and related servicing of machines, paper, ink, toner and the like. Digital operations include healthcare payer and pharmaceutical services, provider solutions for doctors and hospitals, human resource, finance, accounting and procurement services, transactional services for retail, travel and insurance companies, and more. The company also manages databases, networks, digital infrastructure, data backup, system platforms and devices, cloud storage, and centralized print services for thousands of other organizations and businesses.Potential Stock Price DoubleThe Xerox stock price to cash flow number is arguably much lower than common sense would dictate. At the present $13 share quote, Xerox is trading at 5.5x annual cash flow and a little over 6x free cash flow. Compared to the trailing company specific 10-year averages of 6x cash flow and 7.5x free cash flow, new and existing shareholders are still receiving better than typical rates of money creation at the operating level. In addition, free cash flows available to business owners should rise nicely in coming years, especially on a per share basis with aggressive stock buybacks continuing during 2014, without any pickup in overall revenues.Reviewing other financial ratios and metrics, total liabilities are roughly equal to current assets, long-term liquid investments and 18 months of cash flow generation, based on March 2014 quarter results. The steady move toward a tangible book value the last three years is noteworthy as underlying liquidation values will give investors a better margin of safety, long-term, and the business more flexibility for capital reinvestment.We can use the mid-2007 peak stock valuation as a guide for potential upside improvement in Xerox. The 2007 experience witnessed a company valued at 1.2x ""trailing"" sales, 2.5x book value, 11x cash flow, 13x free cash flow and 18x earnings per share. Highlighting the potential for shares going forward, an equivalent low-$20s equity price projection is not out of the question for 2015 when measured against Wall Street's estimated 2014 financial results. Wall Street consensus is projecting 2014 numbers for sales per share of $18.50, book value of $11.00, cash flow of $2.30, free cash flow of $2.00, and earnings of $1.10.At the current late stage of the economic cycle overall globally, I feel the biggest risk to Xerox owners is a slowdown in economic progress or a recession. However, it is entirely possible the stock price would either outperform any bear market in stocks generally, or be one of the first to start a rebound from an even lower valuation point. The management team assembled the last 3-4 years is doing an admirable job of keeping capital spending restrained, while buying accretive, complimentary businesses. Xerox has been intelligently using its ongoing cash flows to pay down debt and buy back shares, increasing its underlying value on a per share basis. The company raised the dividend payout last year for the first time since 2008.The mispriced stock after decades of investor neglect and stagnate business leadership will definitely take time to rise to a realistic valuation zone. Another large technology company like International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) or Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) could acquire Xerox, but its nearly $15 billion market capitalization seems to make this outcome a less likely possibility. Honestly the stock price today is only slightly above the 2001 reading, and well below the 1999 all-time peak of $60 or 2007 high of $20 per share.ConclusionA forgotten and written off for dead business focus on physical printing and copiers has been quietly morphing into an integrated digital-based powerhouse story. The robust rise in the Xerox stock quote from its $6 low in 2012 is slowly garnering attention by Wall Street. You can review Xerox's stock price and trading activity progress on the chart below. My work and the Victory Formation system suggest further gains are a real possibility in 2014-15. Please don't forget to include Xerox on your stock research list. It may continue its metamorphosis from an ugly gray cocoon hidden on a faraway tree branch into a brilliant, star-studded butterfly winner that everyone can appreciate in another year or two. And yes, $2.5 billion in annual cash flow, growing nicely into the future, is a headline rate thousands of publicly-traded enterprises can only wish to achieve.

The company is not suitable for the Defensive Investor because of its poor current ratio, lack of a consistent dividend history over the ten-year historical period, and its failure to grow earnings adequately over the ten-year period. For the Enterprising Investor, the high level of debt relative to the company’s current assets is the determining factor. Either type of investor may be better suited looking through some of the Defensive and Enterprising companies ModernGraham has found to pass the requirements. As for a valuation, the company has not shown significant growth in its EPSmg (normalized earnings), however the market is only implying a growth rate of 3.03%, which is supported by the historical performance. As a result, the company appears to be fairly valued at the current time.What do you think? Do you agree that Xerox Corporation is fairly valued? What would be your assessment?

2150963,62713,2014-04-21T09:04:25-04:00,"Management has a new focus on growth while working to bring more innovative capabilities to the operation.The company has made decent progress despite struggles in its outsourcing services segment, which is the company's largest division.On the basis of 2015 earnings per share estimates of $1.22 Xerox is trading at a P/E of 9, which is 5 points below the industry average of 14.","Over the past 6 months, shares of Xerox (NYSE:XRX) have risen close to 20% since reaching an October low of $9.61. Investors have begun to question if Xerox, which is known for its copiers and printers, can duplicate its history of strong revenue and earnings performances. But it hasn't always been easy.The company has made decent progress despite struggles in its outsourcing services segment, which is the company's largest division. The decline in October arrived as management warned that profits for this January quarter would come below expectations. This was due to (among other things) restructuring-related charges. Surprisingly, things weren't as bad as expected.Not only did Xerox report a slight improvement in revenue and profits, management rewarded investors by unveiling plans to increase shareholder value through earnings growth. One of the ways Xerox plans to achieve this is by integrating its Managed Print Services, or MPS, with business process and IT outsourcing to match the increasing demand for connectivity and mobility in printing solutions.Essentially, management is adjusting to changing trends. This was once perceived an area of weakness. But with a new focus on growth in the company's services segment, not to mention innovation, Xerox is no longer the dormant company for which that it has become known. And despite the 20% increase in the past six months, patient investors can still do well here. And these potential gains will be affirmed Tuesday with the company's first-quarter earnings results.Despite an expected dip in profit, analysts are generally optimistic about their expectations. The consensus earnings per share estimate is 23 cents per share. For the full year, analysts are looking for earnings of $1.13, which is expected to grow year over year by roughly 4%.From the standpoint of revenue, analysts will be looking for a slight 4% decrease to $5.15 billion for the quarter. Last year Xerox posted revenue of $5.36 billion. For the full year, revenue is projected to come in at $21.48 billion. Despite the expected dip, it's worth noting that the company's revenue increase in the fourth quarter preceded two straight quarters of revenue declines.This indicates that management's recent restructuring has begun to work. The same goes for profitability, of which Xerox has posted increases in two consecutive quarters, including a 3% year-over-year increase in the January quarter and the 1% increase in the third quarter.What's more, despite recent complaints about slowing growth and rising threats from rivals like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Lexmark (NYSE:LXK), Xerox has not been sitting on its hands. To its credit, Xerox has listened attentively and has responded with several acquisitions over the past couple of years. One of these buys was software-as-a-service (SAAS) company Customer Value Group, which was picked off last year for an undisclosed amount.This deal supports management's focus on growth of the services segment, while bringing more innovative capabilities to the operation. The key to Xerox's direction, however, will be the extent to which management can continue expanding margins. This is what analysts will want to see on Tuesday - 60% of which rates Xerox as a buy. And I have to agree.With Xerox stock still 80% below its all-time high, it would be a gross understatement to say that the company has seen better days. Investors have every right to be encouraged by the company's 82% gains in 2013. And the company's recent moves suggest that these shares still have more room to run.With the stock trading at $11.43 and a trailing P/E of 12, there is significant value that still remains. On the basis of 2015 earnings per share estimates of $1.22, Xerox is trading at a P/E of 9, which is 5 points below the industry average of 14. I believe with management's growth strategies in areas like healthcare, which should help offset weakness in areas like document technology, these shares should reach $15 in the next 12 to 18 months.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Wall Street Playbook's tech sector analyst.

O'Shaughnessy suggests in his impressive book ""What Works on Wall Street"", a winning ranking system, which he calls ""Value Composite Two"". The ranking method takes into account the following factors in equal proportions:1. Price-to-book2. Price-to-earnings3. Price-to-sales4. EBITDA/EV5. Price-to-cash flow6. Shareholder yieldAccording to Mr. O'Shaughnessy, Shareholder yield unites a stock's dividend yield with its buyback yield to show what percentage of total cash the company is paying out to shareholders, either in the form of a cash dividend or as expended cash to repurchase its shares in the open market. The buyback yield is the percentage of one year reduction of the company's shares outstanding.I used Portfolio123's powerful ranking system, which allows the user to create complex formulas according to many different criteria, to build the ""O'Shaughnessy Value Composite Two"" ranking system.In order to find out how such a ranking formula would have performed during the last 15 years, I ran a back-test, which is available by the Portfolio123's screener. For the back-test, I took all the 7,014 stocks in the Portfolio123's database.The back-test results are shown in the chart below. For the back-test, I divided the 7,014 companies into twenty groups according to their ranking. The chart clearly shows that the average annual return has a very significant positive correlation with the ranking system. The highest ranked group with the ranking score of 95-100, which is shown by the light blue column in the chart, has given by far the best return, an average annual return of about 21%, while the average annual return of the S&P 500 index during the same period was about 2.7% (the red column at the left part of the chart). Also, the second and the third group (scored: 85-90 and 90-95) have given superior returns. This brings me to the conclusion that the ranking system is very useful.After running the ""O'Shaughnessy Value Composite Two"" ranking system on all S&P 500 stocks that pay a dividend with higher than 1% yield, on May 28, I discovered the twenty best stocks, which are shown in the table below. In this article, I will focus on the third stock of the list Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) since I have been following the stock, in order to find an opportunity to start an investment in this stock.Source: Portfolio123Xerox CorporationThe CompanyXerox is the world's leading enterprise for business process and document management solutions. The company was founded in 1906 and is headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut.Valuation MetricsThe table below presents the valuation metrics of XRX, the data were taken from Yahoo Finance and finviz.com.Xerox's valuation metrics are very good; the forward P/E is very low at 10.21, and the Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio is also very low at 8.16. Moreover, the stock is trading near book value; the price to book value is low at 1.15, and the price to sales is very low at 0.66.Latest Quarter ResultsOn April 22, Xerox reported its first-quarter 2014 financial results, which beat EPS expectations by $0.03 (12.50%) and missed Street's consensus on revenues.First-Quarter HighlightsIn the report, Ursula Burns, Xerox chairman and chief executive officer said:Also in the report, the company offered an outlook for the second quarter and for the full year:Dividend and Share RepurchaseXerox has been paying dividends since 1977, but had stopped its payments between 2002-2006.The forward annual dividend yield is at 2.06% and the payout ratio is only 24.5%. The annual rate of dividend growth over the past three years was high at 10.6%.Source: Charles SchwabXerox generated $286 million in cash flow from operations during the first quarter, and repurchased $275 million in its stock. In addition, the company said that its strong cash position enabled a fast start to its share repurchase program, and it is increasing its full-year share repurchase expectations from at least $500 million to at least $700 million.CompetitorsA comparison of key fundamental data between Xerox and its main competitors is shown in the table below.Xerox has the lowest price-to-free-cash-flow ratio among the stocks in the group. However, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) has the lowest PEG ratio.Technical AnalysisThe charts below give some technical analysis information.Chart: finviz.comThe XRX stock price is 1.52% above its 20-day simple moving average, 5.21% above its 50-day simple moving average and 11.27% above its 200-day simple moving average. That indicates a short-term, a mid-term and a long-term uptrend.Chart: TradeStation Group, Inc.The weekly MACD histogram, a particularly valuable indicator by technicians, is at 0.0614 and ascending, which is a bullish signal (a rising MACD histogram that is crossing the zero line from below is considered an extremely bullish signal). The RSI oscillator is at 62.23 which does not indicate oversold or overbought conditions.Analyst OpinionAnalysts opinion is divided, among the eleven analysts covering the stock, four rate it as a strong buy, two rate it as a buy, three rate it as a hold, and two analysts rate it as an underperform.TipRanks is a website that ranks experts (analysts and bloggers) according to their performance. According to TipRanks, among the analysts covering XRX stock there are only six analysts who have the four or five star rating, four of them recommend the stock. On April 14, Piper Jaffray's analyst George Tong repeated an overweight rating, saying the stock is a compelling ""old stock"" play. I consider Mr. Tong's analysis very valuable, since he has 4-Star rating from TipRanks for the accuracy of his previous calls.Major DevelopmentsAfter that XRX's stock reached 52 weeks high of $12.44 on January 16, 2014, it dropped 17.2% to $10.30 on February 05, but since then XRX's stock value has recovered 18% to $12.15 on May 27. Moreover, in 2013, XRX's stock has recorded an impressive gain of 78.4% while the S&P 500 index has risen 29.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index has risen 38.3% at the same period.On May 06, Xerox announced a definitive agreement to acquire ISG Holdings, Inc. for $225 million, creating a comprehensive workers' compensation suite of offerings for clients in the property and casualty insurance industry. In the announcement the company explained:ConclusionXerox has compelling valuation metrics; its EV/EBITDA ratio is very low at 8.16. Xerox is generating a lot of cash; its ttm price to free cash flow of 7.12 is the lowest of all S&P 500 tech stocks. The company continued to deliver large sums of cash back to shareholders, during the first quarter the company generated $286 million in operating cash flow, paid cash dividends and repurchased its own shares for $275 million. Furthermore, Xerox increased its full-year share repurchase expectations from at least $500 million to at least $700 million. All these factors bring me to the conclusion that XRX stock is a smart long-term investment. Furthermore, the rich growing dividend represents a gratifying income.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in XRX over the next 72 hours.

1864821,36431,2013-11-26T16:21:34-05:00,,"Xerox (NYSE:XRX) is quietly becoming a major factor in the IT and services industry. Or as Seeking Alpha contributor Paulo Santos pointed out, ""This is no longer a company reliant on legacy printers and copiers; it is slowly transforming itself into a services powerhouse."" While I am not completely sold on it as a long-term investment yet, Xerox is definitely heading in the right direction and is a company worth watching.Out with the printers, in with the servicesXerox reports revenues by three different segments: ""Services"", ""Document Technology"", and ""Other."" Services accounted for over half of revenues at the end of the company's fiscal 2012. 84% of revenues, or $18.9 billion, were annuity-based, which Xerox called ""A stable, less volatile base"" in its 2012 annual report.The company also realizes that its Services segment should be the main money-maker in the future, and wants it to account for two-thirds of overall revenues by 2017. Because the company's vision for the future will be based primarily on this segment, and less on its declining legacy businesses, I would like to dig a little deeper into it exclusively.Looking closer at the Services segmentXerox breaks out its Services segment into three different categories.Source: Xerox annual report 2012BPO now accounts for the largest chunk of its largest revenue segment, and Xerox is now the ""largest worldwide diversified business process outsourcing company."" In my opinion, BPO will also be the most important growth driver for the company going forward, and it might even be more lucrative than expected going forward.Capitalizing from healthcare growthXerox's BPO business is looking to capture growth from healthcare services, which now accounts for 18% of the U.S. economy. Overall healthcare services are now responsible for $2.5 billion of Xerox's $22 billion in annual revenue.The controversial Affordable Care Act, or ""Obamacare"", is a main focus for the company as well. This year, Xerox revealed its Medicaid Management Information System, which offers states new efficiencies on a modern platform. Xerox-owned PARC ""developed proprietary software to combat fraud, waste and abuse in healthcare applications."" It also supported the launch of health insurance exchanges in states such as Nevada and Kentucky.Xerox already supports the top 20 commercial health plans in the United States, or two-thirds of the country's insured population. It processes more than 900 million healthcare claims a year. This will likely increase and grow going forward, especially when coupled with an aging population.Transportation solutionsXerox is involved in 30 different countries providing solutions for things like fare collection, solutions for tolls and parking, and even the monitoring of red light cameras. The company is now the largest electronic toll collection provider in the U.S., with over 50% market share. It handles around $2.7 billion in ETC payments, and processes 1.4 billion toll transactions on an annual basis.The company also wants to begin working closely with state governments (most recently the Texas Department of Transportation) to expand its transportation solutions and overall services business. With a $100 million, 5-year deal in Texas, Xerox will be processing over 8 million monthly toll transactions. Its new Texas-based customer service operations are also likely to ""include transaction processing, license plate image review, invoicing, collections, transponder sales and management."" Xerox's verticals and expertise are some of its stronger assets that allow it to obtain deals like this.Fundamentals and ValuationsBesides healthcare and transportation, Xerox's BPO business is also involved in education, with services such as outsourcing of financial aid and enrollment office operations for colleges and universities. It also provides financial services (it handles $421 billion in accounts payable annually), customer care (it's the largest domestic customer care provider to the wireless telecom industry), retail, travel, and insurance. Its business mix, when looking at its BPO revenues, is incredibly diversified.The company has also recently increased its free cash flow significantly:XRX Free Cash Flow (TTM) data by YChartsThis is encouraging and has led to more financial flexibility for the company. Xerox plans to allocate at least $500 million for buybacks, $500 million on acquisitions, and $300 million on dividends. Shares currently yield around 2%, with a payout ratio of only 22%.XRX Cash and ST Investments (Quarterly) data by YChartsXerox has a decent balance sheet, with a significant amount of its debt being related to its customer financing business. Shares trade cheap at 12.15 times earnings and only 9.85 times forward earnings.The bottom lineXerox is quickly evolving into a leading, diversified services company. As CEO Ursula Burns recently told shareholders:The company realizes that it should focus more on services going forward, but currently appears to be doing just fine-- increasing free cash flow and returning more cash to shareholders.For me to be a buyer, I will need to wait and watch the company develop more of a solid track-record. Xerox does appear to have a bright future, but I would rather invest when the Services segment actually does account for over two-thirds of overall revenues.Management is steering it towards this goal, however, and if successful, that's when the company could really be attractive as an investment. It will also likely attract a higher multiple if it can shed its image as a dying copier company. Xerox is a stock to watch closely in the coming years.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1897531,57571,2013-12-13T11:26:30-05:00,,"After posting a dismal quarterly result, Xerox (NYSE:XRX) unveiled plans to increase shareholders' value through earnings growth. The focus would be on growth of the services segment, innovative technology, and margin expansion. It is integrating its Managed Print Services, or MPS, with business process and IT outsourcing to match the increasing demand for connectivity and mobility in printing solutions.(Source: Xerox)Xerox has launched new tools and services with features such as Mobile print app, security, and audit tools. Organizations can easily incorporate these features in existing enterprise print services. These new generations of managed print services will allow printing at reduced costs in a simplified way, boosting the productivity of enterprises. Through Print Server management, organizations can print documents from remote locations, and managed printing services will monitor it. So, organizations will be able to reduce their remote printing cost, as it is more costly to print away from the workplace, and also tackle the security concerns surrounding remote printing.The worldwide MPS market grew from $10.8 billion in 2011 to $11.8 billion in 2012. Further, it is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.75% for the period of 2012-2016. The major factor driving this market is the demand for cost reduction and cloud service offerings. Xerox has remained the market leader in worldwide MPS for the fourth consecutive year, and I believe Xerox could maintain its position within the challenging printing industry and grow in some areas of this market such as cloud services and security audit.Another competitor in MPS is Canon (NYSE:CAJ), which is placed along with Xerox in the Leaders Quadrant of the 2013 Magic Quadrant for MPS worldwide. The acquisition of I.R.I.S, a developer of technology and products for Intelligent Document Recognition, helped Canon offer a host of MPS offerings and strengthen its position in the MPS market. I believe that as organizations look for cost reduction in their printing solutions, there will be more demand for MPS services. This is an excellent opportunity for Canon to promote the benefit of its vast MPS offering and drive revenue for the company.Growth in Health-care marketHealthcare is an interesting industry to watch since the enrollment for Obamacare began about 2 months ago. The new healthcare regulations offer a huge potential for healthcare IT and related technology suppliers; the U.S. healthcare IT spend is estimated to be $40 billion per year. However, the Obamacare roll out has been disappointing so far, with low enrollment and a 10% error rate during the process.Currently, Xerox isn't associated with any of the Affordable Care Act websites, but it has a presence in the healthcare exchanges in Nevada, Kentucky, and other states. It offers a simplified healthcare administrative platform, Medicaid Management Information System, to tackle complicated rules, membership issues, and budget limitations. As of October 2013, Xerox has been awarded $200 million worth of IT contracts from seven states. I believe that as states struggle with the federal infrastructure, more businesses will turn to healthcare IT companies. Healthcare services contributed $2.5 billion out of Xerox's $22.39 billion revenue in 2012, and moving forward I remain optimistic for this market given the pace of technology shifts in the government and healthcare sectors.Xerox isn't the only IT solution provider for Healthcare, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) is also cashing in on healthcare act by advising hospitals, doctors, patients, and government agencies on implementing the law. Last month the U.S. government appointed HP as the provider of data services for the Obamacare website, which was previously allotted to Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). This is because Verizon's data hub center crashed several times over the past months as the insurance enrollment program launched. However, government officials said the contract with HP was signed in July this year and has nothing to do with data service failure. The data center hub is an integral part of the government site as it facilitates the exchange of information between government, state run exchanges, federal agencies, and insurers. In 2011, HHS gave a $55.4 million contract to Verizon, but later gave a $38 million contract to HP.In addition, HP received many healthcare contracts in the last few months. On December 3, HP signed a $180 million agreement with the Ohio department of Medicaid to manage the Ohio Medicaid Information Technology System, or MITS. This is an agreement for four years, under which it will ensure a stable and scalable MITS system. HP is the largest provider of Medicaid and Medicare process management services and is the principal IT provider for Medicaid in 19 states. As more and more states prepare to comply with the policy changes, there will be continuous need for IT support to maintain the system.Bottom-lineXerox is undergoing a rapid transformation from a printer technology company into an outsourced services company. Fiscal year 2013 has been a disappointing year for it, which prompted Xerox to design new strategies to deliver better returns in 2014. The company is focusing on the services business for achieving growth in its top line, which has seen a revenue growth of 3% year over year in the third quarter this year. I believe these strategies won't have a significant impact in the near term since the 4% year-over-year third quarter revenue decline in the document technology segment will offset services growth. Going forward, Xerox's growth story is expected to pick up since the company stands to gain from the growing services segment and healthcare services. The company's EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.08-$1.10 per share in 2013 and is expected to increase up to $1.16 in 2014. I'm optimistic about the company's long-term growth and recommend buying this stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

I'll be watching it hard for the rest of this week.Why Xerox? It's one of the undervalued, steady performers of the IT sector. It's about as dull, even boring, as IT comes. The company develops, manufactures, markets, services, and finances the industry's portfolio of document equipment, software, solutions, and services. It's one of those companies whose name is a verb.Click to enlarge image.DividendsXerox had paid a steady dividend of $0.0425/share since the last quarter of 2007. For Q1 2013 it raised the dividend to $0.0575/share (2.3% at current stock price). Payout ratio is a sustainable 21.3%. It would be nice to see an increase in 2014, but I'm not counting on it. Management seems to be looking to buybacks as the most effective way to return value to shareholders.BuybacksCash flow for the current year is expected to be about $2.5B. The company began a share buyback initiative in 2011, and since that time has reduced the number of shares from 1.38B to 1.23B (-10.8%).Earnings and ValuationEarnings per share stands at $0.27. Earnings have beaten the consensus estimates for each of the past three quarters, most recently by 12.5%. The next quarterly earnings report will be released on Oct. 21, 2013.Valuation multiples are low by industry standards.XRX has an earnings yield of 9.2% (vs. 5.7% for the S&P 500). Morningstar rates it four stars (a value rating). Valueexplorer.com considers XRX's fair value to be $12.20 based on mean multiple value, indicating a potential upside of 31%.What Do the Experts Say?Analysts tend to like the stock. Morningstar's consensus reports an analysts' average of 4.0 on a 5-point scale for a solid buy. StarMine's Equity Summary rates it 8.5 on their 10-point scale, near the top of the bullish range (7.0-8.9).It came to my attention as one of only eight stocks held by all three of my current favorites in the equity ETF arena. These three, which I discussed here, are PKW, SYLD, and TTFS. They each emphasize in their own way shareholder value and shareholder returns, mainly through buybacks that reduce float. SYLD adds dividends and debt pay down to their algorithm. All three funds have performed exceptionally well since their inception. Taken together, they hold some 322 stocks. Scores of these are held by two of the three ETFs, but only XRX and seven others are held by all three.Summing UpI think XRS is a sold buy for a total-return, dividend investor looking for opportunities as the market wavers. Higher yields can be had, obviously, but the total package here looks to be solidly sustainable with minimum downside risk and some substantial potential on the upside.Disclosure: I am long PKW and SYLD.

1735462,23478,2013-10-08T21:32:24-04:00,,"By Dee GillBusiness managers rarely use ""Xerox"" as a verb any more, and Xerox (NYSE:XRX) shareholders are particularly pleased about that. Xerox's success as a corporate accounts manager is finally overshadowing its fame as copier king, and this ongoing shift from machines to services has nearly reversed a two-year slide in the share price, as seen in a stock chart.XRX data by YChartsSo has Xerox finally found a formula for long-term shareholder returns? The experiences of other major tech companies suggest there's still a long hard slog ahead. Dell (DELL-OLD), Nokia (NYSE:NOK), IBM (NYSE:IBM), Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) have each made concerted efforts to improve performance by adding more higher-margin services to their mainly hardware businesses. For investors, the results of those strategies have been rather mixed. Consider:In 2008, PC maker Dell set out to expand its IT services in a big way, which is why it took over Perot Systems in 2009. The markets were at first encouraged but grew worried as demand on the PC side fell off faster than expected. The share price was in a steep decline until Michael Dell began fighting to take the company private, a buyout that was approved in September.DELL data by YChartsNokia tried to add services earlier this decade to offset its weakened position in the cellphone market. It didn't really help shareholders until Nokia sold that phone business to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) earlier this month.NOK data by YChartsIBM is considered the big success in this changeover, having pulled up its software and services sales to about 75% of revenues from 50% in 2000. It helped that IBM began the hunt for services company acquisitions before such takeovers were in vogue. Ten years later, IBM's share price was only marginally higher, although it's up more than 40% since 2010.IBM data by YChartsCisco, Intel, and Hewlett-Packard also adopted similar services expansions in recent years.Perhaps Xerox has a couple of advantages in its quest. First, many of the services it pursues are stickier and not nearly as competitive as the businesses Dell and others chose to enter, like cloud computing. Xerox now gets most of its revenues from services like managing employee benefits, accounts payable and customer care services. It also sets up Health Insurance Exchanges under the Affordable Care Act, processes insurance claims for hospitals, and reads license plate photos for tollbooth operations. Its customers are huge entities that renew their contracts at rates exceeding 80%.Secondly, demand for Xerox's high-end machines hasn't dropped as fast as demand for PCs, servers and non-mobile tech generally. Xerox expects its move from 40% document production to 33% by 2017 to be driven more by growing service revenues.Yet Xerox is in the early days of this transition. Overall revenues are still declining and are expected to be up a mere 1% in 2014. Profit margins haven't materially widened yet. The move toward paperless offices may yet intensify.Consider critically the buy signs Xerox shares are flashing. Xerox trades at a forward PE ratio of less than 10, its dividend yield is 2.2% and strong free cash flow fuels speculation about generosity toward shareholders. But there's no history of steady dividend increases here, which will become important to investors if interest rates rise.XRX Dividend data by YChartsXerox investors are hoping it can do better than so many other companies that have been down this road before, and maybe it can. But they might want to prepare for a long, painstaking process to get there.Disclosure: I am long CSCO, IBM. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1635492,25338,2013-08-14T15:08:45-04:00,,"Introduction:With the stock market reaching all-time highs, every equity-based portfolio should have its share of stocks with more conservative valuations. A perfect stock to consider is Xerox (NYSE:XRX), because:Because Xerox's operations are not well known to all (other than its scanners and copy machines), I will start with a qualitative overview of its current and future operations. I will then get into my valuation to prove that it's still fairly cheaply valued, even with the 40% TTM cumulative gains to its stock price.By the end of this article, I hope to get investors to consider looking into Xerox as a potential 2-4 year investment that offers both safety (relative to other equities with similar growth potential) and the potential for strong returns.Overview: No Longer a Copy Machine CompanyXerox released the first commercial copier in 1960, and has since been well-known for selling printers, photocopiers, printing presses, and other office hardware worldwide. Anyone that has been a corporate employee has glanced at the red Xerox logo overlaid on dull, beige, and bulky multi-purpose machines, or heard a colleague say ""the Xeroxed (photocopied) pages are on your desk."" But those memories represent a Xerox of the past: the company is quickly transitioning to being a service-based enterprise, concentrating on IT, business process management, and outsourcing.This transition began in 2010, when Xerox acquired Affiliated Computer Services (ACS) for $6.4B. Many say that Xerox overpaid in this transaction, but was more of a concern for the shareholders at the time. Looking at Xerox in 2013 and onwards, what matters is that the acquisition (and a few other smaller ones) have allowed Xerox to continually transition to offering business services, a space with much more growth opportunity and higher margin potential than its document management business, all while maintaining strong free cash flow.Xerox happens to be especially strong in healthcare: 2/3 of all US insured patients are served by Xerox. With a healthcare industry that is increasingly pressured to modernize and reduce costs, and with this pressure set to mount significantly, leaders (like Xerox) in the healthcare IT and consulting space are going to see strong growth and demand. And healthcare is just one industry; Xerox has a presence in IT and business process management for Finance, Education, Insurance, Manufacturing, Retail, Travel, and Transportation. The opportunities for growth are huge and numerous, and Xerox has the cash flow to invest in whichever specific areas it determines will generate the best returns (healthcare being one of them).As further support, its documents management business is not going anywhere: while it is not growing due to a tough (and mature) market, Xerox is still the global leader, and has made the investments to remain so in the foreseeable future (Examples here - ""Xerox's investments in software and solutions include tools that provide predictive analytics and data to simplify print environments and deliver further cost savings. In addition, Xerox ConnectKey™ lets workers scan and upload documents to cloud repositories, send business-critical documents directly into workflow processes and print securely and easily from any mobile device"").Overall, think of Xerox as a company that will remain the global leader in corporate document management and printing systems, but whose growth opportunities will come from its services, IT, and outsourcing operations. It is a stable and profitable business with strong future growth potential.Xerox's Stock is CheapTo prove this point, I ran my valuation model with what I consider to be negative projections. While I'm not projecting black-swan-style results, I am assuming that Xerox's transition does not succeed fully and that the company is left treading water until 2017, unable to grow its free cash flow. I am also projecting zero progress with restructuring, reflected by declining margins. You can download the model and run it with your own assumptions/modify it here.The projections above, based on the assumptions in my DCF model, yield the following valuation:This represents a downside of about -5.6%, which is a small loss, and shows that Xerox's current valuation is built on solid foundations. Below is the resulting valuation graph, which shows Xerox's share price based on public comparables and varying assumptions in the DCF model:Xerox's share price seems to be on the low end of most valuation metrics, another sign of a fairly valued, if not undervalued stock.Change the revenue growth assumptions to more optimistic projections, and you easily reach a 15% upside. Combine that with projections of restructuring success, and the upside potential explodes, surpassing 100%. Below is an example of projections that could achieve such high returns:This optimistic valuation shows an upside of almost 135%. In the end, it is impossible to very accurately predict the company's future cash flows. However, it is clear that Xerox shows little downside risk with huge upside potential, giving investors a favorable risk-reward ratio.Conclusion:Xerox is a rare stock in today's high-valuation market: it is cheap, giving it low downside risk. But it is also in the midst of a significant transition, giving it huge upside potential, should its transition be successful. While I don't expect the stock to rise by more than another 15% this year, its strongest upside should come closer to mid-2015, when its transitional and restructuring efforts should be complete, and its new services business should be firing on all cylinders. Xerox represents a rare opportunity to make 50-100% gains in the next few years without taking a huge risk, and should be considered by every equity investor that manages a long-term portfolio (and invests in stocks in the tech universe).Stock price at the time of writing: $10.02Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

From the collision of these two realities Xerox might emerge as being an investible equity.The business todayXerox is no longer entirely reliant on selling printers and copiers. Its business now revolves around 2 distinct segments:While document technology is stagnated or declining, services is seeing growth, leading to an overall picture of stagnated to single-digit revenue growth.At this point, services accounts for 54.7% of revenues, versus 41.9% for document technology. As revenues trend towards services, they expose their greater growth, which favors Xerox as a whole and moves it further and further away from being a dying dinosaur.The slide below shows how these segments have been growing (Source: Company presentation)Operating margins at both segments are comparable, around 10%, so Xerox's evolution rests mostly with the ability to grow services quickly enough to compensate for the erosion in the document segment.Xerox still carries significant debt, at $8.1 billion, but this has been heading lower as it also generates significant cash flow. Xerox has guided for 2013 operating cash flow of $2.1-$2.4 billion and free cash flow of $1.6-$1.9 billion.Part of Xerox's debt load is somewhat illusory - it stems from the financing of customers' purchases, for which it holds offsetting financial assets. We could say that $3.2 billion is a more realistic debt load once we consider those offsets. Both the cash flow and debt loads are illustrated in the slide below.ValuationTaking into account $2.9 billion TTM EBITDA, $13.1 billion in market capitalization and the full $8.1 billion debt load, this shows us XRX trading at an EV/EBITDA of 7.3 times. Excluding the financing debt load that's offset by financing assets, the EV/EBITDA would be 5.6 times.Both 7.3 and 5.6 times are rather low for a stable to growing business in a Bernanke-infused market. Outside of such market these would probably be neutral multiples, but in the midst of monetary madness they're cheap multiples.As a comparison, International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), which has undergone a similar transition from hardware towards services, trades for 8.7 times EV/EBITDA.Presently IBM is having about as much trouble growing its top line as Xerox, which is understandable since both companies now try to act in about the same business.A case in pointThis last Saturday the EBT cards malfunctioned in 17 States. These cards are used to distribute welfare benefits such as SNAP/food stamps. The culprit? A backup gone wrong in one Xerox datacenter.While these were not good news and might even lead to a small negative impact on Xerox today, this also highlights just how far Xerox has come. Xerox is, unknowingly to most, a prime beneficiary of the ""welfarization"" trend. Clearly, it has a strong hold on this recurring business in a very large number of States, as was illustrated by this temporary failure.These types of businesses are very attractive, they're basically like toll roads and, given the dynamics at work, these are toll roads which are likely to show increased usage over time.YieldAlthough Xerox is undergoing a slow transformation towards services, it's doing so from a position of strength, as shown from its large free cash flow. Part of this free cash flow is being directed towards dividends, producing a dividend yield of 2.2%.This dividend yield isn't incredibly high, but on the other hand it consumes less than 20% of XRX's free cash flow. This makes it seem both sustainable and potentially able to grow over time.ConclusionThe misfortune of a bungled backup leading to the interruption of EBT service in 17 U.S. States shows just how far Xerox has come in its transformation. This is no longer a company reliant on legacy printers and copiers; it is slowly transforming itself into a services powerhouse.While XRX does so, it more and more shifts into a higher-growing segment, enabling it to show overall growth in revenues. This happens at the same time the company generates significant free cash flow and trades at a sensible valuation. A valuation which can be called ""cheap"" under monetary madness rules. As these rules prevail, I'd expect XRX to trade higher. If XRX trades down on this EBT mishap, it's probably a buying opportunity.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The technology hardware industry has also experienced similar circumstances. Similarly, many global companies have experienced adverse circumstances in Europe which have limited their top line growth as they turn to expense cuts to produce profitability. In this scenario, Xerox Corp. (NYSE:XRX) has adapted a change in strategy as the revenue profile has shifted emphasis from products to services. This development occurred because Xerox was also unable to witness any strong prospects within US despite the relative stability of the economic conditions in the region. For the current fiscal year, flat revenues are expected but a considerable increase in EPS is likely to occur.Revenue Profile And Stock PerformanceAs stated before, the company's major portion of revenues are coming from the services segment due to a decline in the performance of products like printers and copiers. The company pursued some strategic transformations in FY09, which included the acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services Inc. (ACS).The above chart shows the revenue profile of the company with respect to business segments and regions. The document technology segment has been shrunk to become the second largest contributor to the revenues of the company but it still forms a strong proportion of total revenues. On the other hand, most of the company's revenues are coming from US and exposure to markets other than US and Europe is relatively small.Source: YChartsThe above chart shows the performance of the company's stock as compared to the S&P 500 index since the beginning of the current fiscal year. The chart shows that the market has responded positively to the changes in the business model conducted by the company and the confidence in the management of the company has improved over this period. This is reflected in the stock price as the appreciation of the company's stock in the reference period is almost double that of the overall market.Comparative Financial PerformanceOver the past few years, the company's stock price as compared to its peers has remained at par. Most of the players in the overall industry have underperformed. Accenture (NYSE:ACN) appears to be amongst the few players that have shown strong stock price appreciation. The financial performance behind the stock price movements will provide a better insight into the matter.Source: YChartsThe above chart shows the change in diluted EPS of Xerox Corp. as compared to Accenture, Hewlett Packard (HPQ) and Canon (NYSE:CAJ) since the beginning of FY11. The chart clearly shows that over this period, Xerox and Accenture are the only two companies which have shown earnings growth whereas the earnings have declined for the other two competitors.The overall industry operates at weak margins as the growth in this sub industry has been overcome by the newer technologies. As a consequence, the revenues of information technology services industry have shown an average three year growth of 5% and average net income over this period has actually declined by 5%. At the same time, Xerox has reported corresponding average revenue growth of 13.8% and average net income growth of 35.1%. Despite the stagnation in revenues expected this year, the company's business model reflects promising prospects over the long term.Comparative Valuation and RiskIn order to establish the company's position in the industry and understand the potential of the stock, a comparative valuation analysis has been conducted using some key valuation indicators.Data Source: MorningstarThe above table shows the valuation metrics of Xerox, its competitors and the overall industry. We see that the company appears to be undervalued against its competitors and the overall industry across all valuation metrics. At the same time, the company offers a very decent dividend yield of 2.1%. This allows for a very strong upside potential. Accenture on the other hand appears to be overpriced across most valuation metrics which has limited the prospects of stock price appreciation. Xerox is also subject to some serious risk factors such as the high degree of competition in the industry. Also, the execution of the shift in business model appears to be smooth as yet but if the stagnation in revenues persists, the earnings growth will not be sustainable.ConclusionThe management of Xerox has done a decent job in creating a strong business over the years. The growth of the company has been pursued through strategic acquisitions. In the near term, the top line growth is expected to stagnate but in the long run, the company is projecting a promising picture. The undervaluation of the company also favors the upside potential of the company. Keeping these factors in view, a buy recommendation is proposed for long-run investors as the stock is at a decent buying position at current price levels. The profitability of the company will eventually be reflected in the stock price, resulting in decent gains for the investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1385651,29371,2013-04-30T15:06:12-04:00,,"IntroductionAbout a year ago, I wrote my first article on Xerox (NYSE:XRX) titled Renaissance Era Coming For Xerox. Since then, the company's common stock total return is about 6.7% compared to declines of -16.1%, -21.4%, and -2.9% for competitors Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Canon (NYSE:CAJ), and Lexmark (NYSE:LXK), respectively (see graph). Even following this positive performance compared to its major competitors, Xerox shares offer good value to investors.In addition, the company is continuing to position itself strategically in the services and document technology segments and does not seem affected by the government sequestration in the U.S. (Xerox derives much larger portion of its government revenue from state and local governments than from the federal government). Any improvements in the global economy are likely to benefit Xerox, as the company provides technology and services that represent significant fund capital outflows for its customers. Demand for its services should rise when the economy recovers and companies' and governments' confidence returns. On the negative side, Xerox's performance could suffer if the recent trend of companies keeping their technology services in-house continues.Valuation and fundamentalsXerox had 1.23 billion shares outstanding as of March 25, 2013 compared to 1.35 billion shares outstanding as of March 26, 2012. The company has been actively repurchasing shares, and it plans to repurchase over $400 million of its own shares in 2013. A decreased number of shares improves the per share performance and allows a company to increase its per share dividend.During its latest quarter that ended on March 31, 2013, Xerox profit margin from service revenues remained flat compared to the same period of 2012 and stood at 9.3% while revenues rose by 4% to $2.92 billion. Many investors are probably concerned about Xerox's inability to improve its services margin. However, the company continues to sign new clients and as its contracts (which generally have multi-year lengths) mature, increased profits should follow. Xerox's signings in the last quarter grew by 64% compared to the same quarter in 2012 reaching $3.7 billion (75.7% of which was in business process outsourcing). Once this growth normalizes, Xerox will certainly start thinking more about margins.Xerox's recent performance is significantly better than that of HP, Canon, and Lexmark as evidenced in the stock performance. For example, HP saw its revenues decline in four out of five segments and overall its revenues declined 6% in the quarter compared to the first quarter of 2012. Its enterprise services group, which is roughly comparable to Xerox's services business, recorded revenues of $5.92 billion during Q1 '13 or a -7% decline from Q1 '12, and the operating margin declined by 1%. Below is a table comparing key valuation measures and fundamentals for Xerox, HP, Canon, and Lexmark.Source: Capital IQ, Thomson Reuters, SEC filings, author's calculations; EBITDA - earnings before interest, tax depreciation, and amortization; CFO - cash flow from operations.*Includes the Middle East and AfricaAs seen from the above table, Xerox offers an attractive dividend yield and EBITDA margin and the lowest price-to-book value ratio. On an EV/EBITDA basis, it is the most expensive stock, but this is justified. For example, Lexmark is competing more directly with Canon, which is currently more competitive due to the declining yen. Canon is also suffering from decreasing demand in digital cameras due to competition from ever-improving smart-phone cameras. Finally, HP, Canon, and Lexmark derive significantly larger portion of their revenues from Europe where economic pressures will likely not ease in the near future. It seems like investors are still valuing Xerox as a hardware company while it should be valued more like a services company, similar to IBM (NYSE:IBM).New developmentsXerox's goal in 2013 is to spend $500 million on acquisitions primarily in services but also in the printing area. In Feb. 2013 it acquired the French-based Impika, a leader in production inkjet printing in such industries as packaging, security, and commerce. This acquisition should allow the company to offer more printing solutions to its corporate customers. Demand for printing is not expected to disappear anytime soon. For example, when a person goes to the emergency room, the healthcare professional still gives a printed sheet of instructions how to care after being discharged. There are many similar examples from ticket printing at the train station and the airport to shipping labels where it is just easier if you can put the piece of paper in your pocket. However, Xerox did sell its paper and print media business in the U.S. and Canada to Domtar (NYSE:UFS) in Mar. 2013.Xerox continues to provide assistance as states near the deadline for setting up the health insurance exchanges as mandated by the Affordable Care Act. Xerox has been awarded contracts by a number of states including Nevada, New Hampshire, and Wyoming. Xerox should be able to capture even more of this business as the deadlines for the states and their health insurance exchanges are approaching quickly:In addition, Xerox research center in Grenoble, France is developing a new parking congestion solution. Citizens receive notification on their smart-phone when a parking spot is available and the price, which fluctuates depending on the time of day, they have to pay. This is expected to complement Xerox transportation services, particularly in California where Xerox is providing parking management solutions to municipalities.A threat is the more recent trend of in-sourcing IT by a number of leading companies as discussed in this article by Techrepublic.com. The major reason companies are increasingly deciding to keep their data processing capabilities in house is that they want to be able to stay on top of the latest technology, be able to develop technology expertise, ability to leverage in-house information systems, and costs (implementation, adapting, and monitoring). However, due to the specific areas where Xerox operates (healthcare and transportation) and its large exposure to the government sector, the threat of in-sourcing seems minimal at this time for Xerox.ConclusionWithout a doubt, Xerox is a leading technological company that is successfully transitioning to services. However, many of its common stock fundamentals and valuation measures seem closer to a hardware company than a modern data processing and business outsourcing company. For example, IBM has an enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio of 8.9 or over 50% higher than that of Xerox. As Xerox continues to increase its service revenues this share price discount should narrow and it could turn into a premium.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1525532,27231,2013-06-27T17:29:09-04:00,,"We have been following Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) since the middle of January 2012 largely because David Einhorn (Greenlight Capital) had purchased 17M shares of the company in Q4 2011. We were attracted to the company because it had purchased Affiliated Computer Services in 2010 and we liked that Xerox's goal was to transition its revenue exposure from hardware towards IT and Business Process Operations Services. We believe that those lucky investors who bought into Xerox at $7/share or less in Q4 2012 should give themselves a pat on the back and take their profits, especially since David Einhorn sold Greenlight's position in Q1 2013. We believe that conservative investors should reduce or sell out of Xerox and find another company that has stronger business fundamentals. Although the company has enjoyed a 17.4% jump in its adjusted EPS, this was due to the following non-operating factors: Source: Morningstar DirectXerox's GuidanceDue to the weak economic environment of the eurozone, Xerox continues to report sour results. We think it is becoming a trend on Xerox's part to meet consensus adjusted estimates and to reduce forward guidance and also to announce ""non-recurring restructuring charges"" that are ""excluded from adjusted EPS guidance"". Following Xerox has been like water torture not because the stock has underperformed the S&P 500 by 13% since we began increasing our research resources on it, but because the company has been steadily reporting guidance that has been soft and sour. At least we didn't buy into Xerox when everyone did in January 2012. At the beginning of 2012, Xerox issued adjusted EPS guidance of $1.12-$1.18 for FY2012. As of Q3 2012, the company has once again revised its guidance down to a range of $1.07-$1.09; down from $1.07-$1.12 in Q2 2012 and of course the company couldn't even make that target. XRX's FY 2012 reported EPS was $0.88 and its adjusted EPS was $1.03. But don't worry, this time they're projecting $1.09-$1.15 in adjusted EPS for FY 2013. Thankfully for XRX's management, people have probably forgotten that it projected $1.12-$1.18 in adjusted EPS for FY 2012.Source: Xerox's 2012 Earnings ReportsXerox's Recent ResultsOnce again, Xerox announced soft financial results. As expected, stable performance in its Business Process Outsourcing business and growth in its Information Technology Outsourcing businesses was offset by soft performance in its Document Outsourcing business and its Technology equipment, services and peripherals division.Concerns We Have About Xerox and its ManagementWe can understand why investors have concerns about Xerox. Ursula Burns has been President or CEO since April 2007 and the company's stock has generated a negative total return of 41% in that time frame. Xerox earned $1.22 in reported EPS in 2006, the year before Burns became President. Despite spending over $4.1B in acquisitions and $3B on share repurchases, Xerox's Adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.15 and its reported EPS is expected to be $1 after accounting for acquisition related intangible amortization and restructuring charges. Part of our apprehensiveness with regards to jumping into Xerox alongside Greenlight Capital is because we were concerned that the weak macroeconomic environment was an excuse for poor management and execution issues. We believe in calling things as we see them and we think it's appropriate to consider the poor results we have seen under Ursula Burns when evaluating her tenure.Source: Morningstar DirectFinancial PositionWhile the company is lugging around $8.5B in short and long-term debt, it is largely offset by $5.6B in finance receivables and equipment leases as well as $1.3B in investments in equity affiliates and $1B in cash. The company has a common shareholders' equity base of $11.5B, however $11.7B is due to goodwill and intangible assets from acquisitions. The company's cash flow patterns are seasonal in which it generates the lion's share of its cash collections in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year. The company generated $1.8B in free cash flows on its $11.5B equity base over the trailing twelve months, which was slightly lower than the $1.865B achieved in 2009 before the ACS acquisition. We don't consider ACS to be a deal from hell though because we can see that the ACS IT Services operation strength is offsetting weakness in the legacy Xerox operations. For the purpose of our free cash flow calculation, we included acquisition spending as a free cash flow outflow against operating cash flows because the company has been making acquisitions on a recurring basis and its operating cash flows benefit from the increased depreciation and amortization adjustments to net income, which also reduce taxable income and cash-based tax payments.Source: Morningstar DirectComparisonWhile Xerox has seen soft results and issued a sour outlook, we believe that it compares well against its IT outsourcing competition (or at least if we were not to count its underperformance against Accenture (NYSE:ACN). Besides Accenture, we would compare Xerox against Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) HP Services division and Dell Inc's (DELL-OLD) Dell Services segment. Xerox gets 54.5% of its MRQ revenue from its services and solutions versus 100% for Accenture, 25% for HPQ and 22.5% for Dell. Xerox's Services Division generated 3.5% revenue growth year-over-year in Q1 2013 versus -8% for HP Services and 2% for Dell Services. The one area that Xerox Services has shown some material weakness relative to its IT Services peers is its operating margin because it operates exclusively in outsourcing services, while its peers are also involved in IT consulting and other higher-value-added services. We have seen Xerox's outsourcing services operating margins pressured recently due to the ramp-up of new service contracts as well as concessions extended to certain customers in order to retain business. Our thesis going into this conclusion was that although Xerox may not be Accenture, at least it isn't HP Services or Dell Services and we can conclude that our thesis here holds.Source: MRQ Reports for Accenture, Xerox, H-P and DellConclusionIn conclusion, we believe that Einhorn was premature in green-lighting a reentry into Xerox. At least he was smart enough to know when to get out. Although we are attracted to some of XRX's features, we're disappointed in its ongoing soft performance and sour guidance. Now that Xerox's market price has almost converged with its book value, we believe that investors should look elsewhere, or at least until the company replaces Ursula Burns as CEO. We also noticed that Franklin Mutual Advisers (Michael Price's old shop) trimmed its position in XRX from 6.75% in Q3 2012 to 5.62% in Q1 2013. Although it isn't as strong as IT Solutions leader Accenture, at least it is in better shape than Dell and Hewlett-Packard. However, Ursula Burns' leadership has not been able to stem the revenue declines in its hardware business, Accenture is a much stronger competitor than Xerox Services and Xerox's shares have generated a total return of negative 41% since Burns has been CEO.Source: Our Most Recent Report on XeroxDisclosure: I am long ACN.

1361451,47231,2013-04-23T10:48:30-04:00,,"Today I am going to look at the 3-D printing sector, a sector that is enjoying a lot of investor enthusiasm right now. I am going to focus on a new technology that could justify this investor appetite for stocks in the sector. Much of the growth forecast for the 3-D sector is from parts printing. Revenue in the sector is estimated to grow into a $7 billion industry by 2019. The real growth driver however will come from printed electronics, which none of the players in the 3-D sector can do right now. Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) has developed a technology that could literally explode the upward sales trajectory of 3-D printing in the coming years, and in turn help lead to a manufacturing resurgence in the U.S. It is called printable flexible electronics and XRX has estimated that it will grow from a $1 billion per year industry to $45 billion by 2016.I have not seen XRX talked about much with regards to 3-D printing even though it pioneered the sector in the 1970s. When 3-D stocks are discussed it is the usual candidates:Stratasys Ltd. (NASDAQ:SSYS)3D Systems Corporation (NYSE:DDD)The ExOne Company, (NASDAQ:XONE)XONE, a recent IPO, has seen its shares gain 50%. This is an indication of how investor appetites are high for 3-D stocks right now. It is a smaller player in the sector but it too is growing sales. Two other companies that could have a big impact in the sector in the coming years are Xerox and iRobot, (NASDAQ:IRBT).In a recent article the New York Times went over the new technology that XRX has developed that could change manufacturing in the U.S. in a massive way. The technology, developed by PARC (the same division that invented the graphical mouse based operating system that inspired both Bill Gates and Steve Jobs) allows the ""printing"" of micro circuitry, something that has alluded all of the 3-D printer players thus far. Currently, chips are printed on large wafers that hold hundreds of dies, each with the same electronic circuitry. The wafers are then cut into individual dies and then assembled on printed circuit boards.XRX has developed a laser printer that will place tens or hundreds of thousands of chiplets, the size of a grain of sand, on a surface at the exact right location. The chiplets can be microprocessors and computer memory as well as other circuits needed to create complete computers. They can also be MEMS, that perform tasks like sensing heat, pressure or motion. This new system that XRX has developed could be used to build computer systems or be part of a 3-D printing system that prints objects with computing printed right in. Currently, 3-D systems can only print a toy car. With XRX it can print a remote control car with all the computing and electronics needed to make it run. This small advancement will be a massive boon to manufacturing in the U.S. By replacing the circuit boards, this new technology could dramatically shrink the supply chain that spans the globe and employs hundreds of thousands of workers, many of them in Asia. Using laser printers, Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center may one day be able to create desktop manufacturing plants that use chiplets to ""print"" the circuitry for a wide array of electronic devices.This new technology from XRX could be great for companies like DDD and SSYS. SSYS offers desktop 3-D printers for idea and design development, a range of systems for rapid prototyping, and production systems for direct digital manufacturing. It is one of the leading stocks that come to mind when mentioning 3-D printing.Below is one of SSYS's largest manufacturing printers.It can print almost anything one can think of. NASA engineers are using 3-D printing to build the next generation rover to support humans exploring other worlds, such as asteroids and eventually Mars. However, one thing these printers cannot do, yet, is print electronics. The SSYS printer can print a robot's arms and legs and joints but it cannot print the electronics that run it. Another company looking to change this is iRobot. This is another stock one does not hear mentioned when it comes to 3-D printing, but it too is getting into this hot new sector. On January 23, IRBT filed a patent for an autonomous all-in-one 3-D printing, milling, drilling and finishing robot.The new system includes a fabrication machine that fuses additive and subtractive manufacturing with component placement to provide completely autonomous all-in-one product manufacturing. The fabrication machine may be used in factories, by individuals or the military in the field for producing and repairing products. The processes, including FDM and Robocasting, will allow for products made up of numerous materials, including ABS, polycarbonate, silicone rubbers, urethane rubbers, and plastics, and low melting temperature metals, as well as combinations of these materials. This would greatly help in the further adoption of 3-D printing in the manufacturing sector.A quick look at XRX financials make this stock an even more compelling buy for long-term investors. With a forward PE of only 7.55 XRX can be considered the cheapest play in the sector. In the most recent year XRX generated $1.88 billion in free cash flow. XRX also pays a 2.57% annual dividend, an excellent addition to a stock being held long term. As you can see XRX has a solid business right now without even projecting possible revenues from the new 3-D technology. While the upside growth in the sector will be split among many companies, even a small piece of the potential sales could have big bottom line implications for XRX.Of course we must also delve into the risk factors associated with investing in such a new sector. When I look for stocks to invest in I look for at least two plays in the sector. First I look for a new company/entrant with a lower share cost, higher stock price and a possibility of a stock split down the road. SSYS falls into this category. The other type of stock I look for is a more ""mature"" company in the sector, if one exists. With 3-D printing stocks, I believe I have found both investing criteria. XRX is without a doubt a mature company. As mentioned above the company posts strong profits, cash flow and a nice dividend yield. While SSYS brings the risk aspect to the sector play, I also have a mature dividend slow moving stock to compensate for that. Also, the possibility that the new 3-D technology XRX has developed could dramatically change the sector soon, is a great bonus.As for sector risk there is of course large risk in the 3-D sector. The current pricing of 3-D printers is still sky high. The current euphoria in the sector is being driven by the price declines of the at-home printers for individuals. Most models have started to come down in price over the last year with an average cost now under $2,000. This is still very expensive but reminiscent of the pricing seen years ago when paper printers first hit the market. This has garnered much of the attention but I feel this is NOT the market that will make the sector. It will be manufacturing. The key to the sector booming over the next decade, and the stocks continuing higher, is adoption of 3-D printing in manufacturing. The new technology of XRX could be key to this next phase in the 3-D sector growth. If however, the adoption rate of XRX's new technology is slower than expected, or fails to occur, then the risk will be that 3-D printing remains a niche only for those who can afford it. However, even with this risk I believe the opportunity for large gains in the coming years will be well rewarded.The next few decades in the U.S. may very well be called the renaissance of U.S. manufacturing thanks to 3-D printing. 3-D printing is a disruptive technology that seems poised to change the manufacturing sector in a large way. Currently the surge in 3-D printing is in the parts manufacturing segment. While this area has tremendous upside it pales in comparison to printed electronics. XRX appears to have developed a technology that will explode the 3-D printing sector in the coming years. iRobot is also working on allowing an expansion of the market. Investor appetites are high for 3-D stocks right now and it seems as though that enthusiasm is warranted. XRX , the boring old stock, may end up being the best way to play this sector in the coming years. With its low PE, decent dividend yield and very exciting electronics printing technology, long-term investors should reap very nice rewards in the coming years. Even if the 3-D revolution does not come to fruition, the fundamentals in XRX make it a strong long-term investment with large upside if its 3-D business grows.Disclosure: I am long SSYS.

1462451,25255,2013-05-27T04:56:16-04:00,,"A couple of weeks ago, Greenlight Capital released its Q1 letter to its investors. As usual it leaked to the press and we were able to take a look at what Mr. Einhorn is doing with his portfolio. One thing that caught my attention is that he closed his long position in Xerox (NYSE:XRX).I am a big fan of Mr. Einhorn and have tremendous respect for him and his investing abilities but in this case I believe that either he made a mistake or there are more reasons than that behind his move.The truth is that after the ACS acquisition, Xerox is slowly but steadily changing its business model from a shrinking printer company to a growing services one. However, while its Services segment is steadily increasing its revenue, the Document Technology segment is losing revenue quickly enough to negate somewhat the positive effect. Furthermore, margins are indeed declining both in the Services segment and the overall company for the last two years.(Source: Xerox's 2012 10-K)Despite the fact that what Mr. Einhorn says is true, it is only half the story about Xerox. 2012 was the first year that the Services segment of Xerox surpassed the Document Technology segment and generated significantly more than 50% of the company's revenue and profits. This year, its share of revenue will become even greater and will continue to grow until either the Document Technology segment closes or stabilizes.What this means is that from this year on Xerox will grow faster and faster until the company's growth rate matches the growth rate of its Services segment. Here is what Xerox's CEO had to say on this at the company's annual shareholder's meeting.The take away is that Xerox will continue to accelerate its growth and given its management's stated goal to raise Services margins at 10% to 12% I believe the company has the potential to surprise to the upside.While Mr. Einhorn wasn't convinced about the company's growth prospects and therefore sold out, I choose to take a different approach. I believe that even if the company's plans don't pan out, the company is still significantly undervalued.Management expects earnings for 2013 to be between $1.09 and $1.15 per share and analysts expect them between $1.08 and $1.12. Even when using the lowest estimate, the stock trades for just 8 times its expected 2013 earnings.With the Services segment growing at 6% and the economy improving, I think that Xerox is worth at least 10 times the midpoint of the analysts estimate which is $1.10 per share. That $11 fair value is 20% higher than the current price and provides significant margin of safety for the case that the company fails to improve its margins in the following years.That's why investors should keep their positions in Xerox despite Mr. Einhorn's departure from the stock. At least I'm keeping mine until either it reaches $11 (or more) or I find something else way more safe and compelling to invest into.Disclosure: I am long XRX.

Rather, the most potent marketing tool in the world is inspiring consumers to use that company's name as a verb -- one that is synonymous with what that company does.For example, Google (GOOG) knew it had made it when people started to say ""Google it"" as a succinct way of referring to a Web search.But every now and then, your company's name becoming shorthand for a routine function can turn against you.Case in point: Xerox (XRX). Back in the 1980s, before computers were common (or crucial) in corporate offices, photocopiers were the centerpiece of recording and sharing company information. That's when the phrase ""Xerox it"" surfaced, slang for the act of photocopying.The advents of PCs and cloud storage have significantly quelled the need for high-end photocopiers, and Xerox has fallen from relevancy. Investors have also noticed the demise of Xerox's stature, dismissing the company as yesteryear's investment.That's a mistake. Xerox has done a poor job of telling its story, but the company is far more relevant -- and profitable -- than the market is giving it credit for.The New And Improved XeroxThink Xerox is just a photocopier manufacturer? Guess again.Mass-transit ticketing systems, digital printing presses, packaging printers, wide-format scanners and digital document management systems are all part of Xerox's current (and relevant) menu of products. Xerox still makes photocopiers and personal printers, too, but those products are now a minority part of its business mix. Most of Xerox's top line is now driven by services.In the first quarter of this year, Xerox generated $2.92 billion in service sales. That's 55% of the total revenue mix, up from 51% in the first quarter of 2012. Conversely, product sales and leasing revenue fell to $2.14 billion, or 40% of the company's top line for the first quarter. That's down from 43% in the first quarter of 2012.A pessimist could note that last quarter's total sales fell 3% on a year-over-year basis, or that revenue was down nearly 1% last year, to $22.4 million. Neither point paints a particularly encouraging picture. But what the numbers alone don't explain is that Xerox has only recently made its full foray into digital document management and related services.Take the company's e-discovery business line as an example. The acquisition of Lateral Data last year greatly expanded Xerox's capabilities in the e-discovery industry -- a rapidly growing arena for the legal industry. E-discovery gives law firms the tools and framework needed to manage and share the massive amounts of digital data often used in today's court cases. The e-discovery service and software market is projected by some to be worth $9.8 billion by 2017, up 96% from last year.In early June, Xerox acquired e-learning outfit LearnSomething, which serves the pharmaceutical and packaged goods industry. LearnSomething's software quickly and efficiently delivers information to remote workers. But, under the care of Xerox, LearnSomething could become a much more potent tool.And Xerox has many more new revenue-bearing tools on the way, if not already under its umbrella.Value GaloreWhile revenue growth stagnated last year (and earnings actually slumped a little), bear in mind that 2012 was largely a retooling year in which Xerox fostered a more intense focus on its higher-margin service businesses. The company's top line isn't expected to grow much this year either; analysts forecast $22.37 billion in sales in 2013 and $22.54 billion in 2014.So what, pray tell, makes Xerox such a great investment?Answer: The stock is cheap relative to earnings, which are expected to grow significantly even if revenues don't.The latest analyst estimates say per-share profits are on pace to grow from $1.03 in 2012 to $1.10 this year to $1.18 next year. That's a growth rate of ""only"" 7% for this year and next year. But bear in mind that Xerox has a history of beating estimates. In fact, the company has topped earnings estimates in nine of its past 13 quarters.When it's all said and done, the trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10 is low enough to be considered a bargain as is. Xerox's expected 2014 P/E of 7.8, however, is about as much of a bargain as an investor could hope for, especially knowing shares of competitors like IBM (IBM) and Canon (CAJ) are priced at P/E ratios of 13.5 and 15, respectively.Risks to consider: Although the company is delivering a top-notch service or product in its key markets, many consumers -- not to mention investors -- don't realize Xerox does so much more than just photocopiers now. Other companies will have an easier time leveraging their brands while Xerox continues to reposition its brand name and image.Xerox may be undervalued, but the market is seeing it like a value stock, and that's not apt to change anytime soon. Investors dreaming of triple-digit gains in just a few months may be disappointed. But for patient value-seeking investors, Xerox shares could justify up to a 30% gain within the foreseeable future.Original PostDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Regardless of a copier's manufacturer, you weren't just making copies - you were ""xeroxing."" But times change and the electronic revolution has forced the world's leading ""document company"" to take on a major transformation. If the company does pull it off - investors could be making a lot of money. If it doesn't, well, Xerox could quickly become an also-ran.Whether or not it succeeds has now become more relevant to income investors, since Xerox just announced a massive 35% bump in its quarterly dividend. It's the first time Xerox has increased its return of capital to shareholders since reinstituting the dividend back in December 2007. The dividend was eliminated after a breathtaking collapse in share price during the dot-""bomb"" era. (Shares slid from $60 to $4 in roughly 18 months. Ouch.)The new dividend will be $0.0575 a share, payable April 30 to shareholders of record as of March 28. That annualizes out to $0.23 a year, for an above-average yield of 2.81%. But if Xerox can't pull off its transformation, the dividend bump could be nothing more than a trap…From Documents to ServicesXerox is focusing its future on designing and implementing business solutions across a broad spectrum of services from business to IT outsourcing and data processing, and from healthcare solutions to benefits management and customer relationship management for businesses and governments worldwide.As the company website states, ""Its technology, expertise and services enable workplaces… to simplify the way work gets done so they operate more effectively and focus more on what matters most: their real business.""That's a far cry from the copiers and printers that built the company. For Xerox to not just survive, but prosper, in the brave new world of information technologies, it needs to make these moves.CEO Ursula Burns says the company's expanding services business will soon account for a full two-thirds of revenue by 2017, turning Xerox from a low-growth business into a high-growth one.But this kind of transformation doesn't happen overnight. A sea change in business direction like this often means rough waters ahead. This became apparent in January, when the company released its fourth-quarter results. Revenue fell by 0.69% year-over-year. And EPS was down almost 10%.Yet the shift to services appears to be working. Revenue from the services division grew by 2.33%, while the old line equipment division was down to a meager 17% of revenue. In fact, the services division now accounts for 52% of revenue overall. Additionally, XRX expanded its operating cash flow for 2012 by 31.57% to $2.58 billion. All good signs.And with a P/E ratio of just 9.18, shares are reasonably valued.Bottom line: Xerox could very well pull off this transition - and do it with flying colors. And while the increase in dividends is definitely a good sign, hold off for now. Watch for a few quarters of improving numbers and increasing dividends before committing any capital.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1223661,24802,2013-02-27T05:08:47-05:00,,"Most of our portfolio's technology stocks are those housed in what many consider to be high-growth industries. Companies such as VMware (NYSE:VMW), Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), and F5 Networks (NASDAQ:FFIV) dominate our portfolio. However, there is a place for older, more traditional technology companies, such as IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO). And in this article, we would like to highlight the opportunity that shares of just such a technology company are presenting to investors. For many, Xerox (NYSE:XRX) is a technological relic of a bygone era, a company whose products and offerings are no longer relevant. At first glance, the company's share price would seem to confirm this. At under $8, shares of Xerox are well below their 2007 highs, and a shadow of the company's peak price in 1999 and 2000. However, the company's shares do not need to appreciate to historical levels for investors to see meaningful profits. In our view, shares of Xerox offer compelling value at these levels, and we break down our bullish thesis below. For the record, unless otherwise noted, financial statistics and management commentary will be sourced from one of three places: Xerox's Q4 2012 conference call, its Q4 2012 earnings release, or its 2012 10-K.Q4 2012 Results: Hidden Gems of ProgressXerox's Q4 2012 results were released on January 24, 2013, and the company posted pro forma EPS of $0.30 on revenue of $5.923 billion. Xerox beat consensus estimates by 1 cent on EPS, and by $0.02 billion on revenue. Setting aside a beat on the top and bottom lines, the company's results, on the surface, showed little that could support a bullish thesis on the company's shares. Revenue fell by 0.69% year-over-year, and EPS fell by 9.09%. However, Xerox is making progress in its transformation into a service-oriented business. CEO Ursula Burns stated on the company's Q4 earnings call that, ""Xerox is a company that is going through a seismic transformation. 2012 was a year of alignment. Getting our costs aligned with our services-focused business model, getting our investments aligned with key priorities, getting our diverse portfolio aligned with market opportunities and getting our operations aligned to address these opportunities. We're doing this through a customer-centric approach that takes full advantage of our brand, innovation and global scale. I feel good about our progress, and I am confident that we will deliver strong results in 2013."" For many, Xerox resembles an enterprise version of AOL (NYSE:AOL), a company wholly dependent on a shrinking legacy business as it races against the clock to complete its transformation into a growth-oriented company. However, while Xerox's headline results may not provide room for optimism, the company's segment performance, as well as its cash flow, contain hidden gems of progress.Although total revenue at Xerox shrank by 0.69% in Q4 2012, the company's annuity revenue (the division that houses its services business) grew by 2.33% in Q4 2012, almost completely offsetting a 13.11% drop in the company's equipment revenue, which now account for just 17% of total revenue, down from 20% a year ago. And while revenue at Xerox shrank in Q4 2012, operating income increased by 3.2% to $613 million, driven by a 30 basis point expansion in Xerox's consolidated operating margin to 10.3%, reflecting the company's continuing shift towards services. On the company's Q4 earnings call, CEO Ursula Burns noted that services now account for 52% of Xerox's total revenue, and by 2017, they will represent 66% of total revenue. And while Xerox's overall revenue are being pressured, for the time being, by the decline of its equipment business (which shrank by 13.11% in Q4 2012), continued growth in services is mitigating the decline. In Q4 2012, Xerox's services revenue grew by 6.63% to reach $3.054 billion. However, operating profit within the service segment rose by 15.88% to $343 million, due to a 90 basis point expansion in the segment's operating margin to 11.3%.But perhaps what is most notable about Xerox's Q4 results is the growth the company saw in operating cash flow. Although the company's pro forma EPS fell by over 9% in the quarter, operating cash flow grew by nearly 39% to reach $1.773 billion (for all of 2012, operating cash flow grew by 31.57% to reach $2.58 billion). And although Q4 2012 is a seasonally strong quarter for Xerox in terms of operating cash flow (due to seasonal changes in working capital), the comparison is valid because the same seasonality existed in Q4 2011. In any case, the 31.57% growth in full-year operating cash flow incorporates all the effects of seasonality. Many critics of Xerox argue that the company is suffering financial distress, even though its operating cash flows tell a different story. It is these cash flows that we wish to focus on, for we believe that they will drive upside for Xerox investors in 2013 and beyond.There are several growth opportunities embedded within Xerox's services business, opportunities that the company addressed at its most recent investor conference with Goldman Sachs. Lynn Blodgett, Xerox's head of services, spoke at length about the company's plans for 2013 and beyond. He noted that Xerox sees opportunity in expanding its healthcare business, through the growth in Medicaid associated with the Affordable Care Act. He stated that Xerox is bidding on multiple Medicaid contracts across the country, and argues that Xerox's technology and variety of pricing points allow it to offer customers capability that its competitors cannot match. With over 17% of the company's services business generated from the healthcare sector, it is a sector that is set to drive growth at Xerox. Xerox's healthcare business also serves to highlight its exposure to government spending, which has long been a concern for Xerox investors. However, when investors look under the surface, they will realize that such concerns are unfounded. While Xerox does generate about 25% of its services revenue from various levels of government (4% from federal), most of its exposure is tied to non-discretionary spending, such as Medicaid, or state toll-road systems, which are generally insulated from reductions in government spending.Revenue growth in services will also come from an increasing renewal rate. While Xerox's renewal rate stood at 79% in Q4 2012, its renewal rate for all of 2012 was 85%, 500 basis points above its renewal rate for 2011 (changes in renewal timing and slippage can inflate or deflate renewal rates in any given quarter). On the company's Q4 2012 earnings call, Xerox's management team outlined that it expects its renewal rate to hold steady or climb in 2013 as the company pushes forward with its services transformation. Another aspect of Xerox's service transformation that needs to be considered is the opportunities embedded within the business for margin expansion, and the impact that this will have on Xerox's bottom line. Lynn Blodgett stated at the Goldman Sachs Technology & Internet conference that 80% of Xerox's costs lie in high-cost markets, a much higher proportion than competitors such as IBM. Xerox expects that a continued focus on restructuring will continue to allow for incremental margin expansion at both the service division level and the corporate level. In addition, a shift towards smaller and shorter-term individual deals (another source of concern for investors), actually helps margins, as Xerox stated on its Q4 2012 earnings call. CEO Ursula Burns took time on the call to note that this is not an issue that is unique to Xerox. Changes in the industry, as well as continued uncertainty have led to shorter contract lengths, and Xerox is not alone in experiencing these trends. However, the expansion of healthcare in the United States, steadily improving margins, and a focus on increasing renewals will serve to mitigate the effects of economic uncertainty on Xerox's service business.Capital Deployment & Financial Position: The Opportunities to ComeIn 2012, Xerox deployed capital across a variety of channels. The company repaid $150 million of debt, bought back $1.052 billion in stock (around 9% of total shares), paid $231 million in dividends, and spent $276 million on acquisitions. In 2012, Xerox acquired several companies, including Wireless Data Services, a British consulting company specializing in mobile technical support, Lateral Data, which specializes in e-discovery for law firms and businesses, and LaserNetworks, a Canadian company specializing in document routing and print device tracking. On the company's Q4 2012 call, CFO Luca Maestri pledged to continue Xerox's omni-channel approach to capital deployment. His guidance calls for capital to be deployed in the following manner: a minimum $400 million of debt reduction, up to $500 million spent on acquisitions (with the majority of that capital set to be deployed on bolstering the company's service business), $300 million in dividend payments, and a minimum of $400 million in buybacks.On February 20, Xerox increased its dividend by 35% to 5.75 cents, which equates to a yield of 2.91%, based on Xerox's closing price of $7.91 on February 25, 2013. Companies in declining financial health do not raise their dividends by 35%, and we believe that this dividend increase reflects the confidence that Xerox's management team has in the company's future prospects. In addition, Xerox will be deploying capital in 2013 towards debt reduction, thereby bolstering its financial strength and increasing confidence in the company's ability to invest in the future. Xerox ended 2012 with $1.246 billion in cash & equivalents (excluding the $1.381 billion of equity that Xerox owns in Fuji Xerox, its Asia-Pacific joint venture with Fuji). At first glance, Xerox's $8.489 billion in debt ($7.243 billion in net debt) seems like a daunting figure to overcome, and one that will choke Xerox's ability to truly invest in its business in a meaningful way. Once again, investors need to look under the surface to see the true state of business. Of Xerox's $8.489 billion in total debt, $5.117 billion is housed in its financing business, similar to the situation at Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Dell (NYSE:DELL). Like its peers, Xerox's financing business uses debt in order to run its day-to-day operations; Xerox's core corporate debt amounts to $3.372 billion (the company has $2.126 billion in core net debt). And as Xerox continues to pay down debt, investor confidence is likely to increase, as skepticism about the company's ability to invest in its business declines. In our view, Xerox's financial position is much stronger than it appears on the surface, and we believe that the company's aggressive capital deployment plans in 2013 will prove to be beneficial in creating shareholder value.Forecasts & Valuation: Highlighting Xerox's ValueXerox posted pro forma EPS of $1.03 for all of 2012, a 4.63% decline. However, this decline is set to reverse in 2013 and 2014.Xerox EPS ForecastsIn 2013, EPS is expected to rise by 8.74% to $1.12, and by 6.25% in 2014 to $1.19. While these growth rates are certainly not the strongest in the technology sector, Xerox's valuation more than makes up for this. Based on its closing price of $8.12 on February 22, Xerox's trailing P/E multiple is 7.68, and the company currently trades at just 7.06x estimated 2013 EPS. These modest multiples, combined with a dividend yield that is currently above 2.8%, offer a compelling value. Xerox also trades well below book value. Based on its 1,223,836,871 outstanding shares, and total equity of $11.664 billion, Xerox's book value per share currently stands at $9.53, giving the company a price/book multiple of 0.83x.ConclusionsIn our view, shares of Xerox are undervalued at current levels. Xerox's transformation towards services will continue in 2013, which, combined with debt repayments and aggressive capital deployment, should serve to dispel the skepticism surrounding the company. We believe that investors should add to or initiate positions in Xerox ahead of this shift in sentiment, for there is ample upside present in shares of Xerox, even if they do not return to historical levels. To its customers, Xerox pledges that with it, they are ""ready for real business."" And with P/E multiples in the single digits, a dividend yield approaching 3%, an omni-channel capital deployment strategy, and a continued transformation towards services, we believe that with Xerox, investors should be ready for real profits.Disclosure: I am long XRX, PANW, FFIV, VMW, IBM, CSCO, AOL.

1142651,22130,2013-01-30T03:27:18-05:00,,"Shares of Xerox (NYSE:XRX) surged higher following Q4 2012 earnings, closing Monday at $8.23. Year to date the stock is up 20%. The company is a deep value play, driven to low multiples by concern that it may not be able to achieve growth going forward. Taking advantage of the low prices and strong cash flow, buybacks have been ongoing. This article updates on growth and buybacks, then digresses into a discussion of R&D.GrowthXerox operates in two segments - Technology (the copier business) and Services. Services encompasses the ACS (Affiliated Computer Services) acquisition, and includes ITO (information Technology Outsourcing), BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) and DO (Document Outsourcing). The question is, can growth in Services (52% of revenue) overcome declining sales in Technology (48%)?Mathematically, if trends observed comparing 2011 to 2012 continue, the answer is yes. A simple projection using a 6% increase for Services and an 8% decrease for Technology going forward goes positive in two years and reaches 3% within 9 years. Using constant currency results of a 7% increase and a 6% decrease, growth is 1% next year and hits 3% in 6 years.During the conference call, management said that for 2013, Technology would be down mid single digits (but with improving trends from 2012), while Services is expected to be up mid to high single digits. Combining that with the generally optimistic tone of the presentation and Q&A, I look for XRX to develop low single digit revenue increases over the next several years.BuybacksXerox expects to generate $2.1 to 2.4 billion of annual cash flow for 2013, and to spend at least $400 million of that on buybacks. To the extent that buybacks are completed at prices less than intrinsic value, shareholders will be better off.For 2012, the company spent $1.05 billion to buy back 146 million shares at an average cost of $7.19, less than current share prices. Shares of common stock outstanding decreased 9% during the year.I think the buybacks are constructive if conducted at prices less than 12X forward guidance, providing growth in revenue and earnings materializes as Services continues its strong performance.Highly regarded CFO Luca Maestri will be leaving to join Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). He was associated with the heavy buyback activity, and one analyst questioned the impact of his departure in that regard. Not surprisingly, CEO Ursula Burns remarked that buybacks will continue to be part of a balanced capital allocation.$400 million of buybacks in 2013 is less than $1.05 billion in 2012. As such, buybacks are no longer a primary driver of share price appreciation. However, if the company has other, more productive uses for its generous cash flow, that's good news. The dividend is to be increased by 35%, and $400 million of debt retired. $500 million is earmarked for acquisitions to support Services growth.DividendAfter leaving the dividend unchanged at 4.3 cents quarterly since 2007, Xerox plans to increase it by 35% in April this year.Dividends have received increased market recognition lately. It will be a positive for long-term share price appreciation if increases are made on a regular basis in the future.R&DXerox has a tarnished reputation, an aura of faded majesty, on R&D. It's easy to point out the products that originated in their research facilities but were successfully commercialized by others. From a 2007 article in Fortune:Let's take a look at what's happening today.As detailed in a recent press release, Xerox received 1,215 US patents in 2012. Overall, patents were up 17%.Addressing the issue of relevance to the increasingly important Services business, the company cites patents that were issued in that area:From an article on CTO Sophie Vandebroek published in the MIT Technology Review:ACS Acquisition in RetrospectHewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) ill-conceived acquisitions of Autonomy and EDS have retrospectively cast a shadow over the whole idea of hardware companies buying software or services operations. In support of the bull case on Xerox, their acquisition of ACS was much better thought out and implemented.ACS when acquired in February 2010 had revenues of $6.5 billion and had grown 7.9% annually for the past 5 years. The Xerox Services segment now has $11.5 billion of revenue and can be expected to grow 7% annually. ACS was acquired at a price of $63.11 per share, somewhat less than my fair value estimate of $67. ACS CEO Lynn Blodgett was retained and continues to run the Services segment.In contrast, EDS was dead in the water when acquired by HPQ. The Autonomy deal was done at 10X sales, twice any realistic valuation, and allegations of fraud have since surfaced. Relationships with former Autonomy CEO Mike Lynch are hostile.ValuationBased on the premise that Xerox can grow revenue at 2% annually, and EPS at a somewhat higher rate, I apply a P/E of 12 to estimated GAAP earnings of $1 and arrive at a target price and fair value of $12 per share.Strategy and TacticsBuying at today's prices, patient investors have a realistic expectation of receiving increased dividend income and eventual share price appreciation.It's important to monitor segment revenue growth and margins quarterly, since the mildly bullish thesis here relies on a resumption of growth and improving margins in the Service business.For investors who use options, the pricing on the deep in the money LEAPS is attractive.

1271581,25255,2013-03-13T16:58:10-04:00,,"I keep finding two highly misleading bear arguments about Xerox (NYSE:XRX) all over the web. I call them misleading because those who use them seem to have trouble understanding Xerox's fundamentals. Here are the arguments:- The company has a huge load of debt.- The company is stagnant and won't grow going forwardFirst I'd like to talk about Xerox's debt and a fact that many investors seems to miss. As you may know Xerox is selling all kinds of copying, printing and scanning equipment to businesses and consumers all around the world.As you can read below, a third of all the equipment Xerox sells is sold under a leasing agreement. This means that customers ""rent"" the equipment for a period of time (usually several months or even years) after which they become owners.Xerox is using debt (among other things) to finance these agreements. Below you can see Xerox's debt broken down to Financing Debt and Core Debt.There are two reasons that this distinction is important. First the cost of the financing debt (interest and everything else) is passed to the customer and is essentially free. Second the financing debt is backed by the contract between Xerox and the customer and the actual equipment. That means that it doesn't affect Xerox's financial strength except for losses from customers that default on their payments.Leaving the financing debt aside Xerox's net debt (debt - cash) position is about $2 billion. It is 17% of Xerox's equity and equal to its free cash flow for 2012. That is quite the opposite of an overleveraged company don't you think?Below is a table with Xerox's debt maturities (for the whole amount of its debt). As you can see even if the whole $8.4 billion where core debt, Xerox would have no problem either repaying it or servicing it. The amount that is set to mature every year is just half the company's free cash flow.Now with the first point answered and the company financially secure lets move to the second one, growth. I addressed this issue somewhat in a previous article or mine, ""Xerox: A High Quality Stock At A Dirt Cheap Valuation"".However I'd like to expand some more and explain the two main drivers behind Xerox's EPS growth. The first driver is the company's services segment. With the acquisition of ACS in 2010 Xerox begun its transformation from a commodity-type product manufacturer to a business-to-business services provider.As this segment grows its share in Xerox's profits, the overall growth for the company will increase. And this process will only accelerate because the printer segment is declining consistently. I expect Xerox to achieve an average 3% to 7% growth rate for the next decade.The second driver of growth for Xerox's EPS is its buyback program. Utilizing its massive free cash flow Xerox bought more than 10% of its own shares in 2012 and has committed to do the same in 2013.As the company's cash flow grows and its number of shares declines it will become increasingly easier for the company to continue this course benefiting tremendously its long-term shareholders. I expect the buyback program to add to the company's EPS growth by an average 5% to 10% over the next decade.ConclusionXerox has a strong and healthy balance sheet, has low debt and a lot of growth potential ahead. The company is highly likely to offer its investors an EPS growth rate between 7% to 17% over the next decade through organic growth and an extensive share buyback program.I strongly believe that Xerox is ridiculously cheap at its current valuation of 8 times its forward earnings. For this reason I have bought shares of the company and intend to sell them at a P/E multiple of 12 or higher.Disclosure: I am long XRX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1167321,25255,2013-02-08T05:26:18-05:00,,"Since the 2010 acquisition of ACS, Xerox (NYSE:XRX) has transformed from a ""commodity like"" printer manufacturer to a high quality service provider with a lot of potential for growth.Xerox according to its site is:That means that Xerox offers a wide variety of outsourcing services, leveraging its legacy technology and expertise.The reason I am mentioning all these isn't to advertise Xerox but to emphasize one overlooked fact. Xerox has created a strong & expanding business moat around itself. All these services that Xerox offers have one thing in common... the need for continuous communication and cooperation between Xerox and its customers.The business & personal relationships that are created in the process (given that Xerox does its job well of course) are a big barrier that a competitor will have to overcome to take Xerox's customers away.""So what?"" you might say, ""How does all these affect me, the shareholder?"". Well, businesses with that kind of moat enjoy stable earnings even in rough times and their future earnings trajectory is easier (and safer) to predict.As you can see in the two charts below the company was absolutely right to turn its attention to outsourcing services. The services segment currently generates 52% of its revenue and is growing while the technology segment generates 42% and seems like it hit the roof.Now let's talk about earnings and valuation. In 2012 Xerox generated $1.03 EPS (7.8 P/E ratio) adjusting for non-cash one-time charges. For 2013 the company expects adjusted EPS between $1.09 and $1.15. Analysts expect $1.12 (7.15 P/E ratio) of adjusted EPS for 2013. Furthermore, Xerox generated $1.69 of FCF/share in 2012 and expects the same for 2013.Given that its services segment grows at 7% while its technology segment shrinks at a 4% rate, I expect that for the next 3 to 5 years Xerox will grow at an average 3% rate. After that and as its technology segment continues to shrink (and becomes a smaller drag) I expect it to grow at an average 5% rate.Bonus facts:All of the above considered along the competitive advantages the company enjoys, I believe that Xerox is worth 13-15 times its projected 2013 earnings. That places its value at $14.56-$16.80 per share which is 80% to 110% higher than its current stock price.Disclosure: I am long XRX. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

1070091,27231,2012-12-18T05:47:43-05:00,,"We have been following Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) since the middle of January largely because David Einhorn (Greenlight Capital) had purchased 17M shares of the company in Q4 2011. We have stepped up our coverage of Xerox in October as the company's shares were trading at a 30% discount to book value. However, we are most certainly aware that just because a company's shares are trading at a low price to book value does not automatically make it a great value. When we first started following Xerox, the company's shares were trading at a 5% discount to book in the middle of January. The primary reason why its price to book discount narrowed to a small 5% discount to book was due to investor enthusiasm surrounding David Einhorn's stake in Xerox through his Greenlight Capital hedge fund. Although Xerox is cheap by many traditional measures such as free cash flow yield, PE ratio and price to book, we have demurred from taking a position in the company because we have been concerned that it was a value trap. We previously covered why we saw it to be a value and in this report we will analyze why we think it may be a value trap.Source: Morningstar DirectWhy Xerox May be a Value Trap:Xerox's CEO Ursula Burns: Ursula Burns has been President or CEO of Xerox since April 2007 and during that time frame, Xerox's stock has registered a negative total return of 57%. Xerox earned $1.22 in reported EPS in 2006, the year before Burns became President. Despite spending over $4.1B in acquisitions and $2.6B on share repurchases, Xerox's Adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.08 and its reported EPS is expected to be $.85 after accounting for acquisition related intangible amortization and restructuring charges. Part of our apprehensiveness with regards to jumping into Xerox alongside Greenlight Capital is that we were concerned that the weak macroeconomic environment was an excuse for poor management and execution issues. We disagree with Oscar Schafer that Ursula Burns is a ""tough, no-nonsense CEO"" based on the performance of Xerox during her leadership of the company. We believe in calling things as we see them and we think it's appropriate to consider the poor results we have seen under Ursula Burns when evaluating her tenure.Source: Morningstar Direct and Xerox's Most Recent GuidanceXerox's Quality of EPS: 2006 was the last year before Ursula Burns was CEO or President and it generated $1.22 in GAAP EPS and $1.05 in Adjusted EPS. 2006 saw its GAAP EPS exceed its adjusted EPS as $500M in Tax Audit Benefits were partially offset by $254M in restructuring charges and $68M in litigation expenses. The company had no adjustments to EPS for FY 2007 and it reported $1.19 in EPS for the year. Unfortunately for Xerox, its EPS from 2008 to present has seen a significant level of adjustments to EPS in each year. 2009 was the year with the lowest level of adjustments ($.15/share) and 2008 was the highest ($.84/share). Of Xerox's $4.90 in EPS from 2008 to 2012, nearly $2/share was clawed back for its never-ending ""non-recurring adjustment charges to EPS"". 2012 promises to be no different as it will see about $.25 in non-recurring charges for restructuring and amortization of acquisition related intangible assets. At least Xerox's management is only targeting $.15/share in adjustments in 2013 primarily due to amortization of acquisition related intangibles.Xerox's Revenue Growth: Xerox's year-over-year revenue growth has never exceeded 3% on a pro forma basis in any quarter since its 2010 acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services. That's not to say that the ACS deal was a deal from hell. In our opinion, we believe that deal was a lifeline for Xerox as ACS's strength in IT Services has offset the weak performance from legacy Xerox operations. Xerox grew its services related revenues by nearly 5% year-over-year in Q3 2012 even though it was faced with significant global macroeconomic headwinds. Unfortunately for Xerox, this was not enough to offset a 10% revenue decline from its products and supplies as well as the associated technical service, support and financing of its products.Source: Morningstar DirectXerox's Guidance: Even though we have not taken a position in Xerox, we believe that covering the company is comparable to water torture. The reason why we feel this way about Xerox isn't because the stock has gone down by 22% since we began increasing our research resources on it, but because the company has been steadily reporting guidance that has been soft and sour. We think it is becoming a trend on Xerox's part to meet consensus adjusted estimates and to reduce forward guidance and also to announce ""non-recurring restructuring charges"" that are ""excluded from adjusted EPS guidance"". At the beginning of 2012, Xerox issued adjusted EPS guidance of $1.12-$1.18. As of its most recent quarter, the company has once again revised its guidance down to a range of $1.07-$1.09, down from $1.07-$1.12 in Q2 2012. Xerox recently announced guidance of $1.09-$1.15 for FY 2013, which was 3% lower than its original guidance for FY 2012.Source: Xerox's 2012 Earnings ReportsConclusionIn conclusion, we have taken a fair and balanced approach to analyzing Xerox. We previously evaluated what we liked about Xerox and we have now analyzed what we don't like about Xerox. One thing that Xerox needs to do in order to enable it to unlock shareholder value is replace Ursula Burns with an executive who knows what he or she is doing. Burns has been President or CEO for five going on six years and has been CEO for more than three years. During Burns' tenure as President or CEO of Xerox, the company's shares have declined by 57% while the S&P 500 has recovered its financial crisis losses and generated a total return of 12% during that time. Xerox's 57% negative total return paled in comparison to the 32% positive total return generated by the S&P SPDR Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:XLK). Although we are pleased to see Xerox make overtures to shareholders by increasing the dividend and share repurchase authorization, we are getting irritated with the sour notes that we've been hearing from management and we question whether Xerox has the right management team to enable it to unlock shareholder value.Source: Morningstar DirectDisclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1071271,25381,2012-12-18T14:24:53-05:00,,"After writing a number of articles about Nokia (NYSE:NOK), one reader approached me and asked me to take a look at Xerox (NYSE:XRX), which may have a number of things in common with Nokia. After all, they are both companies once known to produce high-quality durable goods. While Nokia was the world leader in mobile phones, Xerox was one of the biggest companies in printers and copy machines, along with Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and a few others. During the dot-com bubble, the company's market value was as high as $70 billion, which is 10 times the amount it's at today. Today, while Xerox is still profitable, the company is having two troubles: high debt levels and declining revenue. The investors don't seem to think that Xerox will be successful anytime soon as the company has been trading at a very low P/E ratio for a while.In the last five years, the average P/E ratio for Xerox was 19.1 while the highest P/E ratio was 63 and the lowest P/E ratio was 7.3. Interestingly enough, the company's current P/E ratio of 7.8 is very close to its five-year low (and possibly all time low).In 2003, Xerox generated revenue of $15.70 billion. The next few years, the company's revenues remained pretty much flat year after year. In 2004, 2005 and 2006, the annual revenues for Xerox were $15.72 billion, $15.70 billion and $15.90 billion respectively. The next two years, the company was able to generate $17.23 billion and $17.61 billion respectively. When the recession hit, Xerox saw a revenue decline just like most companies in the world and it reported revenue of $15.18 billion in 2009. After the recession, the company has emerged stronger than ever and reported revenues of $21.63 billion and $22.62 billion in the next two years. In the first 3 quarters of 2012, Xerox generated $16.46 billion in sales with one more quarter to go. The company is expected to reach revenue figures between $22 billion and $23 billion for the current fiscal year. Keep in mind that Xerox currently has a market value of 8 billion, which is nearly one third of the yearly revenue it generates.As for turning the revenues into earnings, the company hasn't been doing that great. Over the years, the annual earnings for Xerox have fluctuated greatly. For example, in 2001 the company reported a loss of 15 cents per share, followed by 2 cents of profit per share in the following year and 36 cents of profit in the next year. Between 2004 and 2008, the company's annual earnings ranged from 86 cents per share and $1.22 per share. During the recession of 2009, the company continued to be profitable but it was only able to generate 55 cents per share in earnings. After the recession, despite recording record revenues, it was only able to report earnings of 43 cents per share in 2010 and 90 cents per share in 2011. By the end of 2012, it is expected to earn less than 1 dollar per share for the year. This may not sound like much; however, the company trades for less than $7 per share at the moment.Moving forward, the company is planning to see future growth by diversifying its portfolio of offerings. This is important because the market is getting very competitive and it is getting more difficult to gain market share when there are more companies fighting for it. Last year, the company increased the number of color printers it offers and penetrated deeper in the market of small and medium size businesses. Internationally, there is a lot of potential growth in smaller businesses who don't usually have long term commitment contracts with hardware providers and Xerox is well-positioned to take advantage of this opportunity.Today, many businesses share documents electronically whereas there is less reliance on paper documents. Many analysts and investors think this is bad for companies like Xerox, but they forget that the company also offers products that help with creation, editing and distribution of digital documents. In an effort to increase its market share in business processes, Xerox acquired ACS for $6.4 billion in 2010. Now, ACS generates more than what it was acquired for in annual revenues.Xerox generates a lot of cash flow in both hardware and services. In the last 3 years alone, the company's cash flow from operating activities totaled $6.8 billion, which is nearly as much as the company's market value. By 2017, the company expects tremendous growth in colored documents and business services whereas it expects a lot of shrinkage in black and white printing and the related hardware. The company plans to respond to the changing market by making declining items a smaller percentage of its overall portfolio offerings and making the growth oriented items a larger percentage of its total revenues.In 2013, the company doesn't expect much revenue growth as it continues to focus on reorganization. The revenue of Xerox in 2013 is likely to be pretty flat compared to the company's 2012 revenues. This is not very bad because a lot of investors and analysts expect the company's revenues (and earnings) to fall dramatically in the near future. Generally speaking, when a company stops growing and becomes a value play, it will have a P/E ratio near 10. When a company is assigned to a P/E ratio well below 10, it is assumed that the company will actually get smaller as opposed to growing. In the short term, Xerox is likely to have a flat growth rate but in the medium and long term, the company should have decent growth, especially after the world economy gets in a growth mode. It is difficult for many international companies to post growth when half of the developed economies in the world are in recession.Under optimal conditions, Xerox should have a P/E ratio around 11 or 12. On the other hand, the company has a lot of debt, $9.35 billion to be specific. Keep in mind that a large portion of this debt (i.e., $7.5 billion) is long term debt and the company will have no trouble servicing this debt with its current cash flow. Regardless, this will drag down the company's valuation a little bit. Because of this, I would expect the ideal P/E value of Xerox to be around 9 and 10 until the company gets rid of a significant portion of its debt. Between 2009 and 2011, the company did a good job of decreasing its total debt from $8.92 billion to $7.10 billion, but it took more debt in 2012.Currently Xerox is committed to return some of its earnings to investors in the shape of dividends and share buybacks. In the last quarter, Xerox increased its buyback program's budget by another $1 billion and committed to increasing its dividend rate once more. In 2013, the company expects to spend $400 million in share buybacks and increase dividend rate by 35%. Many people will argue that the company should pay off debt before returning cash to shareholders, but as long as it can service its long term debt, there shouldn't be a problem.So, back to the question of whether Xerox can be liked by the investors: I think the company can see a lot of appreciation in its value if it reduces the amount of debt it has and convinces the investors that it can post growth once the world economy gets back on track. I think these two items are pretty doable and it will be all about the investor sentiment once the company accomplishes these two tasks. In the short term, there might not be much potential in Xerox but in the long term, there has to be a lot of potential in this technology giant. I surely don't see Xerox being another Kodak. The company is on the right track, and it is surely not behind the curve as much as innovation goes.Disclosure: I am long HPQ, NOK. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

We also have two independent academic studies supporting the premise that investor expectations for quarterly earnings (our whisper numbers) provide greater returns when used as an investment vehicle, and have a greater impact on stock movement than analysts consensus estimates.A company's ""price reaction"" to the whisper number expectation is the key - on average companies that exceed the whisper are 'rewarded', while companies that miss are ""punished"" following an earnings report.According to the Wall Street Journal, ""positive surprises are becoming so common they are nearly universal. They are predetermined in a cynical tango-clinch between companies and the analysts who cover them. All the numbers are gamed at this point.""

1109041,29371,2013-01-13T10:49:13-05:00,,"In one of my previous discussions of Xerox, on April 24, 2012, I highlighted Xerox management team as a reason to invest in the company, among other reasons. Starting on March 1, 2013, Luca Maestri, the current Xerox (NYSE:XRX) CFO, will report to Timothy Cook in Cupertino, CA as the controller for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Moving from an executive role at Xerox to a similar role at Apple is without a doubt a large change for Maestri. Luca Maestri was previously with General Motors and Nokia Siemens before moving to Xerox, and his departure is a surprise.While the role of the CFO is important, the company should not have a problem finding a replacement for its CFO, since it is headquartered next to the financial capital of the world, New York City. Despite this sudden loss for Xerox, the company should be able to perform well in 2013, due to a number of performance measures. This article will discuss the company's 2013 earnings per share, dividend yield, share buy-back, new business opportunities in services, and why the shares seem like a good investing opportunity.Fundamentals and ValuationXerox has 1.27 billion shares outstanding, a market capitalization of $9.2 billion and an enterprise value [EV] of $17.7 billion as the company has $7.5 billion of long-term debt. During its annual investor conference held in November of last year in New York City, the company revealed an increase of its quarterly dividend in 2013 to $0.0575 (from $0.043 per quarter or a 33% increase) for an annual dividend yield of 3.1%.In addition, the company will add $1 billion to its share repurchase program, and this will further boost future per share performance. For 2013, Xerox expects to earn $1.10 to $1.15 per share for a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 6.6 to 6.3. This PE ratio is more reminiscent of a rail or a utility company, not a technology and services company. Below is a table that compares some of Xerox valuation measures to that of major competitors Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), Canon (NYSE:CAJ), and Lexmark (NYSE:LXK).Source: Reuters, author's estimates; * In $$ billions; ** Latest quarter.As seen from the above table, Xerox seems undervalued compared to Canon and overvalued compared to Hewlett-Packard and Lexmark. One of the reasons for the valuation gap with Hewlett-Packard is that Xerox derives much larger portion of its revenues from services compared to Hewlett-Packard. In addition, Xerox is the leader in patents with the company receiving 1,618 patents in 2011 (including patents issued to its Fujitsu joint venture), compared to 1,308 for Hewlett-Packard.Transitioning to ServicesXerox is successfully transitioning to services while maintaining its profitable print business (as well as other hardware businesses). The move to services has been enabled by the company's acquisition of a number of service companies (ACS in 2009 and Global Imaging Systems in 2007 among other smaller companies) and the successful transformation from a hardware to a more service-oriented company. A recent article in Harvard Business Review detailed how Xerox was able to transition itself into an organization that successfully runs its new and old businesses. According to the article, Xerox was able to accomplish this through a combination of cost reductions, streamlining the legacy business, sharing of resources between the two businesses (research and development especially), and creating two new businesses that are run with their own formulas for success.Xerox expects that by 2017, two-thirds of its revenues will be from services. Since the launching of the service business in 2001, Xerox has been slow, steady, and strategic in growing it to its current levels while at the same time, adopting social media as a business-to-business marketing tool and as a ""listening"" tool about its brand and business prospects, according to an article in Chiefmarketer.com. The company's Youtube video A World Made Simpler has over 600,000 views as of this writing highlighting its efforts in social media. At its core, Xerox's marketing strategy is to build and redefine its brand identity, not necessarily generate more sales leads. Other innovative ways in which the company is engaging its own workforce and external customers are blogging, the adoption of Yammer (the enterprise social network), and by using gamification (integrating games in learning and marketing activities). All this contributes to changing the company image from a 20th century print company to a 21st century service company.ConclusionWhile the departure of Xerox's CFO is a loss for the company, it seems like the company's game plan in the next several years is already mapped out. The company will continue to expand its service offerings in demand areas such as government, healthcare, transportation, and finance, while at the same time, simplifying and improving its legacy print business. The shares seem attractively priced and the increase in dividend and share repurchase are two shareholder friendly initiatives that should bring additional value in the future. While there will be challenges in the services business, about 90% of it comes from higher-margin renewals, bringing certainty to cash-flow and revenues. Investors looking to invest in a world-class company with relatively inexpensive shares should consider Xerox.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Although Xerox is cheap by many traditional measures such as free cash flow yield, PE ratio and price to book, we have demurred from taking a position in the company because we have been concerned that it was a value trap.Source: Morningstar DirectWhy We See Xerox as a ValueXerox's Dividend Yield: There is no question that Xerox is cheap based on valuation metrics such as price to book, price to (adjusted) earnings, free cash flow yield and dividend yield. Xerox recently increased its dividend by 35% and this will take effect in Q1 2013. Because Xerox's stock price has been continuously sagging since Ursula Burns assumed Xerox's presidency in April 2007, Xerox's dividend yield is now 3.3%, up from 1% in December 2007 when Xerox reinstated its dividend. Xerox's dividend yield is more than double the 1.58% SEC yield on the iShares Core Total U.S. Bond Market ETF (NYSEARCA:AGG) and it is not far off from the 4.62% weighted average cost of Xerox's debt. Considering that Xerox's 4.62% weighted average cost of debt is tax deductible at its statutory tax rate of 40% as opposed to its effective tax rate of 20% Xerox's effective after-tax weighted average cost of debt is just over 2.75%. This results in Xerox saving 55bp in weighted average financing costs at the margin if it was to opportunistically utilize debt to finance share repurchases.Source: Morningstar DirectXerox's PE Ratio: Xerox has an adjusted PE ratio of 6.5 based on adjusted 2012 and 2013 EPS forecasts of $1.09 as projected by company management. That translates into an earnings yield of 15.4% based on its forecasted EPS. Furthermore, the company's GAAP EPS estimates for 2013 are expected to be within a range of $.94-$1.00 which translates into a forward GAAP PE of 7 and a forward earnings yield of 14.29%. This also translates into a dividend payout ratio of 20-25% based on GAAP EPS results, which gives us confidence that the company is able to maintain or expand its per share dividend distributions to investors.Xerox's Price to Book: Xerox's market price per share of $7 is at a 27% discount relative to its book value per share of $9.60. Part of the reason why the company's share price is seeing a negative disparity to its book value is because over 97% of Xerox's book value is attributed to acquisition related identifiable intangible assets and goodwill. We believe that investors might be concerned that the company may need to take a write-down of its assets due to the soft financial performance that Xerox has achieved under Ursula Burns' leadership. While we are not going to project when and if such impairment(s) would take place, we don't see impairments coming from its legacy Affiliated Computer Services acquisition as that business has been Xerox's island of tranquility in an otherwise truculent macroeconomic environment. We are aware that Xerox announced another restructuring charge of $100M to take place in Q4 2012.Xerox's Free Cash Flow Management: Xerox is expecting to generate operating cash flows of $2B-$2.3B in 2012 and increase it by $100M in 2013. Xerox's cash flow conversion cycle exhibits a strong sense of seasonality at it incurs significant investments in working capital during the first quarter of its fiscal year which results in minimal to negative operating cash flows in the first quarter of its fiscal year. Xerox generates incremental operating cash flows in the second and third quarter and the bulk of its operating cash flows in the final quarter of a fiscal year as it is able to recover its working capital investments during this quarter. We are expecting Xerox's 2012 OCF to come in at the low end of management guidance ($2B) for FY 2012 and we are expecting Xerox's Q4 2012 capital expenditures to be $150M (FY 2012 CapEx ~$525M and $243M for acquisitions) which will result in FY 2012 free cash flows of over $1.2B. Xerox generated $2.085B in TTM OCFs and spent $741M on CapEx and acquisitions for FCFs of $1.344B and used it with $140M in net new borrowings to buy back $1.08B in outstanding shares and pay $330M in dividends.Source: Morningstar DirectXerox's Free Cash Flow Yield: Despite having to deal with nearly $12B in acquisition related goodwill and intangible assets on its balance sheet, Xerox generated a FCF/equity rate of return of over 10% during the last twelve months. Xerox's market cap is $8.93B as of December 7th and we are expecting it to generate $1.2B in FCFs for 2012 and $1.3B in FCFs for 2013. Xerox generated a 15.5% yield on its TTM free cash flows in relation to its current market cap and we are expecting it to at least generate 15% for its FY 2013 FCFs. We also expect the company to maintain its prudent cash management program as the company recently announced it would be adding $1B to its share repurchase authorization.Analyst Ratings on XeroxMorningstar Investment Research has a five-star rating on Xerox. Morningstar has a Fair Value Target Price of $11/share on Xerox and suggests that investors considering buying Xerox shares at $7.70/share or below. Morningstar has had a four-star or five-star rating on Xerox since August of last year. Oscar Schafer of the Barron's Roundtable and former hedge fund management proprietor at O.S.S. Capital also has Xerox as one of his picks for the 2012 Barron's Roundtable. The things that attract us to Xerox are the same things that attract Schafer. We both like its share repurchase program as well as its efforts to fundamentally transform its business away from hardware and towards IT services. We also like that Xerox is in the early stages of its transformational efforts and is trading at a discount to its fair intrinsic value even though it is still generating solid cash flows on its equity base.Xerox's Institutional SupportersEven though Greenlight Capital's 2% stake in Xerox is only good enough for 9th place amongst Xerox's institutional shareholders, it's the most notable shareholder in our opinion because that is what precisely drew us to covering it. Franklin Mutual Advisers (Michael Price's old shop) is the third largest shareholder at 5.53% of Xerox (down from 6.75% in Q2 2012). Franklin owns it through four of its mutual funds (Franklin Mutual Shares Securities, Mutual Global Discovery, Mutual Shares, Mutual Quest and Mutual Beacon). Franklin Mutual has reduced its position by 17.6M in the Q3 2012 period and this represented nearly 20% of its Q2 2012 stake. Dodge & Cox is Xerox's largest shareholder with 9.27% and that firm still has an image of conservative, value-oriented equity investment management. Notable boutiques include NFJ (2.57%), Glenview Capital Management (2.75%), LSV Asset Management (1.36%), Brandes (1.36%) and First Pacific Advisors (FPA Funds 1.1%).Xerox Peer Group ComparisonWhile Xerox has seen soft results and issued a sour outlook, we believe that it compares well against its IT outsourcing competition (or at least if we were not to count its underperformance against Accenture (NYSE:ACN). Besides Accenture, we would compare Xerox against Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) HP Services division and Dell Inc's (DELL-OLD) Dell Services segment. Xerox gets 52% of its MRQ revenue from its services and solutions versus 100% for Accenture, 32% for HPQ and 22% for Dell. Xerox's Services Division generated 4.8% revenue growth year-over-year in 2012 YTD versus -3.6% for HP Services and -1.25% for Dell Services. The one area that Xerox Services has shown some material weakness relative to its IT Services peers is its operating margin because it operates exclusively in outsourcing services, while its peers are also involved in IT consulting and other higher-value-added services. We have seen Xerox's outsourcing services operating margins pressured recently due to the ramp-up of new service contracts as well as concessions extended to certain customers in order to retain business. Our thesis going into this conclusion was that although Xerox may not be Accenture, at least it isn't HP Services or Dell Services and we can conclude that our thesis here holds.Source: MRQ Reports for Accenture, Xerox, H-P and DellConclusionIn conclusion, we have reinforced what we like about Xerox and why we have expanded our coverage of the company. Even though we have not yet taken a stake in the company, we were surprised at its soft performance and sour guidance. The reason why we are continuing to follow the company is because of its 27% discount to book value and the institutional support for its shares. Although it isn't as strong as IT Solutions leader Accenture, at least it is in better shape than Dell and Hewlett-Packard. We have been carefully analyzing and evaluating Xerox to determine when it stops muddling through the muck and morass of mediocrity caused by the eurozone debt crisis before buying into it. We have been approaching it a significant level of care and due diligence reserved for special situation and turnaround plays in order to minimize potential losses and getting in too early because we believe that Xerox offers investors a solid level of cash flow generation and margin of safety. At the same time, we have potential concerns about it that made us concerned whether it was a value, or a value trap and those concerns will be the subject of our next report on Xerox.Disclosure: I am long ACN.

1007321,24594,2012-11-14T13:45:58-05:00,,"Shares of Xerox (NYSE:XRX) closed up 1.4% Tuesday, rebounding from losses in pre-market trading after the company announced a $100 million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter and lowered its full-year earnings outlook.The change in market sentiment no doubt came as investors looked past the headline and digested the good news Xerox planned to deliver at today's investor conference. The company guided for modest revenue growth and 10 percent growth in earnings per share, with 2013 guidance set at $0.94-$1 on a GAAP basis, and $1.09-$1.15 on an adjusted basis. That compares to $0.88 and $1.03, respectively, for 2012 at the midpoint of the company's updated Q4 guidance.Xerox management also announced it plans to spend ""at least"" $400 million on share repurchases -- after roughly $1 billion spent in 2012 -- and raised its dividend for the first time since the payout was re-instituted in late 2007. With a quarterly dividend of 5.75 cents, XRX now yields a handsome 3.6% annually.Xerox is obviously not a high-flying tech company, and even a casual observer of markets would realize that its legacy printing and copying businesses are facing a sea change, as the need for those services diminish in the Internet age. But at Tuesday's close of $6.42 per share, the company is trading just off a 52-week low, and is approaching levels not seen since the tail end of the 2008-09 market crash. It's hard to see why. The company's balance sheet could be better; but net debt of $6.65 per share is acceptable, and the company has lowered its debt by about $1.5 billion since the end of 2009. The company's technology segment -- which includes its legacy copying and printing products -- is declining, falling 7 percent in constant currency during the third quarter [pdf]. But the services segment -- largely the legacy of Xerox's 2009 acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services -- grew 6 percent in the quarter, despite weakness in European and government customers.Flat revenue is not the most enticing reason to buy a stock, but given Xerox's valuation, it should certainly be acceptable. XRX is trading at just 6.6x the midpoint of 2013 guidance, and its free cash flow numbers are even more impressive, given its $8 billion market capitalization:1 -- midpoint of company guidance after Q3 of operating cash flow of $2.0-$2.3 billion, and previously issued full-year capex guidance of $500 million2 -- from company guidance of $2.1B-$2.4B in OCF, $0.5B in capex, given in ""Shareholder Value"" presentation at investor conference, 11/13/122008-2011 data courtesy Google FinanceThe 2009-10 figures were both boosted by substantial working capital adjustments, which more modestly lowered FCF in 2011 and so far in 2012; smoothing out WC, the cash flow generated by Xerox has grown steadily, if not spectacularly. Given Xerox's $8 billion market cap, and even its enterprise value below $17 billion, the cash flow numbers are excellent. They provide Xerox with the financial flexibility to lower its debt -- another $1 billion comes due in 2013 -- repurchase its shares, and return capital to shareholders in the form of a dividend which now yields over 3.5 percent.The bearishness toward Xerox is understandable; with its technology segment facing fears of obsolescence, and even its services segment exposed to the struggling IT segment, a lower valuation makes sense. But Xerox already has that valuation; it's getting more and more difficult to argue that the risks facing the company aren't already priced in. It's not a sexy play; it's not a ""screaming double"" or a ""ten-bagger"" or any of the other terms stock touts like to use. But it is creating steady growth amidst a challenging environment; it is returning hundreds of millions of dollars to shareholders in the form of repurchases and dividends; and it's still an S&P 500 company with one of the most famous brands in the world, and a solid management team that has positioned the company to survive even as the copier business sees a structural decline. And it's trading at less than seven times forward earnings. That's just too cheap, even for a company that is not going to post spectacular growth. At $6.42 per share, Xerox doesn't have to grow very much to be an excellent long-term value.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

861371,29371,2012-09-11T19:47:03-04:00,,"IntroductionSince my last analysis of Xerox (NYSE:XRX) at the end April of 2012, its stock performance is down about 2.5%. This is about 5% worse than the performance of the DJ Global Total Stock Market index, which was up 2.5% during the same period. However, compared to its two peers we discussed in April, Xerox is doing fine as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Canon (NYSE:CAJ) are down by nearly 30% each (see graph). Even two other pure play printer manufacturers, Lexmark (NYSE:LXK) and Ricoh (JP:7752), experienced declines of about 28% and 13%, respectively, over the same period.While there are reasons to be concerned about printing companies, I think there are three reasons to stay optimistic about Xerox. First, the company has a below average valuation with an above average growth rate in its services business. Second, it is a strong cash generator and is deploying this cash wisely, which should benefit shareholders in the longer term. And finally, a spin-off of the technology (printing) business from the services business could also increase the value of Xerox shares.ValuationXerox has a price to book value ratio of 0.8 compared to price to book value ratios of 1.1, 1.2, and 1.1 for Hewlett-Packard, Canon, and Lexmark, respectively. All of these companies are undergoing significant changes and operate in an industry that is also changing, so a price to book value ratio is a good measurement of the company's worth. The reason is that past performance may not be repeated and their future is uncertain.According to data provided by Reuters, Xerox has had the strongest sales growth in the past five years at 7.3% per year, compared to 6.8%, -3.1%, and -3.9% for HP, Canon, and Lexmark. Similar to Xerox, HP offers services and grows via acquisitions, which is the reason for its relatively strong sales growth. Similarly, on a price to earnings to growth rate ratio, Xerox is trading at 0.8 compared to 1.2 for HP and Lexmark. It does not come as a surprise when Xerox CEO affirmed, in a recent investor conference, that Xerox shares are tremendously undervalued.An area of concern might be Xerox's valuation based on enterprise value to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of about 5.8. This is overvalued compared to HP, Canon, and Lexmark's enterprise value to EBITDA ratios of 3.8, 3.4, and 2. HP has had a number of leadership and operational problems in the past few years. And Canon and Lexmark are pure manufacturers and sellers of hardware and lower valuation ratios are warranted. In fact, if we look at IBM's (NYSE:IBM) and Oracle's (NYSE:ORCL) enterprise value to EBITDA (Xerox is starting to look more like them) of 9.4 and 8.9, Xerox is in fact undervalued.Strong Cash GeneratorIn its most recent quarter, Xerox reported total cash flow from operations in the amount of $228 million. The company also confirmed its expectations to generate between $2 billion to $2.3 billion in cash from operating activities despite slightly lowering its full-year 2012 earnings estimate due to weak technology segment. The reason for the unchanged cash flow figure is that most technology sales are financed, so there is little impact on cash. In addition, recent legislation will allow the company to save unplanned about $50 million of cash expense related to its pension funding.Xerox is actively using its cash and it expects to repurchase between $900 million to $1.1 billion of its own shares in 2012. During the first half of 2012, it has purchased about $356 million worth of shares and the majority of the repurchases will be done in the second half of the year. While the share count is increasing by contributions to Xerox stock incentive compensation and pension plans, the share repurchase will have a noticeable net impact on per share results in 2013 and beyond.The second largest use for Xerox's cash is acquiring other companies. The company expects to spend about $300 million to $400 million in acquisitions in 2012. It has been successful with integrating distributors into its Global Imaging Systems subsidiary. Most recently, Xerox acquired an Illinois based leading provider of office technology and software solutions. And on the service side, the company recently acquired Dallas based Lateral Data and UK based WDS. These acquisitions provide Xerox with additional breadth and depth of technology and service offerings while at the same time presenting significant operational synergies.Finally, Xerox spends about $250 million per year to pay dividends. Currently, the stock pays a $0.0425 per share for an annualized yield of slightly more than 2%. Management has indicated that it intends to increase the dividend payout in the future. However, due to the attractive valuation of Xerox common stock and a need to expand its products and services, the largest portion of Xerox's cash will continue to be spent on share repurchases followed by acquisitions. Even at current levels and given the low yield of treasuries, this tax-advantaged dividend is attractive.Corporate RestructuringThere are no specific plans for corporate restructuring at Xerox. The company has hinted a few times that it might sell its highly profitable financing business if a buyer shows it can run it more efficiently. Selling the technology segment together with its financing arm could make more sense. A number of companies have benefited from splitting their growth businesses from the rest of the company. Most recently, McGraw-Hill announced a spin-off of its educational business from its faster growing financial business and IBM successfully bet on focusing on its service business when it sold its PC business to Lenovo.To make things simple, let's assume that Xerox sells the technology business for $3 billion (at about 0.3 times its 2011 sales, a valuation slightly lower than that of Lexmark of 0.38). This gives a value of $2.30 per share. The sale should not be a problem as the company has Charles Prince on its board of directors, who has proven talent in the investment banking field.Xerox is left with a services business that is growing revenues at about 10% to 12% a year based on 2011 performance and has a margin of about 12%. Under these assumptions, the service business would generate about $12 billion revenue in 2012 and about $1.35 of EBITDA per share in 2012 (EBITDA per share is the current EBITDA of $3.5 billion divided by two to account for the business separation and then divided by 1.3 billion shares outstanding). Multiplying this by an enterprise value to EBITDA ratio of 9, which is in line with that of IBM and Oracle or with more service oriented companies, Xerox shares will be worth about $12.15 per share (assuming ""new"" Xerox will have no debt as most of the debt is related to the technology financing business). The total fair value per share for Xerox is $12.15 + $2.30 or $14.45, a premium of over 90% from recent price levels.ConclusionXerox could benefit from selling or spinning-off its technology business. Even without this restructuring, its common stock appears undervalued. Further, the company's ability to generate and deploy cash effectively should benefit shareholders in the longer-term. Despite its recent slump, investors should still feel confident in the future of Xerox.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

877421,24491,2012-09-20T02:33:45-04:00,,"Dividend growth investing is lots of fun, especially when investors have a systematic dividend analysis process to separate dividends that are safe from those that are not. To help the financial advisor and individual investor from falling into the traps of yesteryear, we've created a forward-looking assessment of dividend safety in our innovative, predictive dividend-cut indicator, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. We use our future forecasts for free cash flow and expected dividends and consider the company's net cash (or debt) position to make sure that each company is able to pay out such dividend obligations to you -- long into the future. In this article, let's evaluate the investment merits of Xerox (NYSE:XRX), as well as its dividend under this framework. For an in-depth assessment of Xerox's intrinsic value via our DCF process, please click here.Investment ConsiderationsReturn on Invested CapitalXerox's DividendXerox's dividend yield is about average, offering a 2.2% annual payout at recent price levels. We prefer yields above 3%, and don't include firms with yields below 2% in our dividend growth portfolio.We think the safety of Xerox's dividend is good (please see our definitions at the bottom of this article). We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges (read hiccups in operations), which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). As such, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.That has led us to develop the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion™. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future.For Xerox, this score is 2.6, revealing that on its current path the firm can cover its future dividends with net cash on hand and future free cash flow. The beauty of the Dividend Cushion is that it can be compared apples-to-apples across companies. For example, Wal-Mart (NYSE:WMT) scores a 1.4 on this measure. Also, for firms that have a score below 1 or that have a negative score, the risk of a dividend cut in the future is certainly elevated. In fact, the Valuentum Dividend Cushion caught all dividend cuts in our non-financial coverage universe, except for one, which subsequently raised its dividend above pre-cut levels (meaning it shouldn't have cut it in the first place). The Dividend Cushion also caught the recent cuts by JC Penney (JCP) and SuperValu (NYSE:SVU). We use our dividend cushion as a key decision component in choosing companies for addition to the portfolio of our Dividend Growth Newsletter (please see our links on the left sidebar for more information).Now on to the potential growth of Xerox's dividend. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years, the company has a nice growth rate, and a nice dividend cushion, its future potential dividend growth would be excellent, which is not the case for Xerox. We rate the firm's future potential dividend growth as good (though we're not modeling in dividend increases). The board seems reluctant to raise the dividend, despite excess projected cash flow capacity.And because capital preservation is also an important consideration, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering investors a complete picture). In Xerox's case, we think the shares are fairly valued, so the risk of capital loss is medium. If we thought the shares were undervalued, the risk of capital loss would be low.All things considered, we'd wait for a dividend increase or a pullback in the shares to consider Xerox a nice income play.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

748681,22130,2012-07-25T15:27:33-04:00,,"Xerox (NYSE:XRX) was hammered on second-quarter earnings, primarily on weakening growth and reduced guidance. Shares closed the day at $6.70, resulting in a TTM P/E of 7.2. The company expects full-year 2012 GAAP earnings per share of 92 to 97 cents and full-year adjusted earnings per share of $1.07 to $1.12.With second-quarter revenue down 1% year over year, the investor is faced with the awkward question: what is a no-growth situation worth? The company anticipates repurchasing between $0.9 and $1.1 billion worth of shares for the year, from its abundant cash flow. Can buybacks create value, in the absence of growth?OverviewFrom the 10-K:An Analogous SituationExperience with P&C Insurer Chubb (NYSE:CB) illustrates the possibility of a positive outcome from a no-growth, heavy buyback scenario.For the five years from 2006 to 2011, earnings decreased 7.9%, annualized. The P/E ranged from 6 to 14, averaging 8.5. Buybacks reduced share counts by an average 7.2% per year, while tangible book value increased 11.2% annually. Share prices, which tend to follow tangible book, seesawed with the market, but on average increased 4.4% annually.Value creation, defined as the increase of tangible book value, plus dividends received, proceeded at 12.6% per year. I started in September 2009, using LEAPS as a substitute for share ownership, and achieved an IRR of 35% over a period of almost three years. Buy and hold for the same period would have generated an IRR of 12.8%.There was much talk of headwinds: the soft market in commercial lines, the increased catastrophe risk, the declining interest rates, the dangers of asbestos and environmental liability, the exposure to Directors and Officers Liability raised by the financial crisis, etc. It kept a lid on P/E multiples, that's for sure. But the buybacks created value.Valuing Growth/No GrowthBen Graham proposed a formula: P/E = 8 + 2G, where G is growth. A company with a growth rate of 2% would command a P/E of 12, under that line of thinking. Graham's formula is accurate, but only at low-growth rates.A regression analysis on modern data developed a Graham-style formula of P/E = 11.7 + 0.7G. I prefer this version for growth over 3.5%, and switch to it when projected growth exceeds that level.Labeling XRX as a no-growth situation, and using the midpoint of GAAP guidance for 2012, $0.95 X 8 = $7.60, round to $8. On a long-term basis, and perhaps after a reset, I see growth of 3.5%. $0.95 X 14.2 = $13.Buyback Ad InfinitumMy original hypothesis when opening a position in XRX relied on the idea that buybacks would continue indefinitely, with modest growth. Management expected to deliver about $10 billion of cash flow over a 5-year period, and absent better uses of the cash, could be expected to spend about $1 billion per year on buybacks.The thinking was, that if Mr. Market would not pay up for the shares, buybacks would create value, along the lines described above for Chubb.Putting the above assumptions into a spreadsheet, together with a variable growth assumption and a P/E dependent on growth, I experimented with various scenarios. I assumed that reported earnings would be 65% of cash flow, that 50% of cash flow would be used for buybacks, and that the initial cash flow would increase consistent with growth, if any. I allowed an estimate of average buyback price for the first year: thereafter, share prices (and buyback cost) reverted according to the valuation formula discussed above.The results are very sensitive to the assumptions. At zero growth, if the market permits management to buy back shares at $6.70 for 1 year, reversion to a P/E of 8 will give a pop of 25% to 30% from that price.If growth resumes at a rate of 3.5%, and buybacks continue for one year at the current price, reversion to a P/E of 14 would make this a doubler, or better, from where it lies.Playing it from Where it LiesAfter initiating a position at a price above $10, I reacted to a drop in share prices by doing a vertical call spread, long July 6 calls, short July 7s. That's the equivalent of selling a put at $7, and after the shares closed Friday at $6.70, I'm the proud owner of additional shares.One possible strategy, and a common one among put sellers, would be to turn around and sell calls at 7 on the newly acquired shares.However, buybacks are expected to be loaded toward the end of this year, based on cash flow considerations. If the share price stays down, value creation would be relatively rapid. With that in mind, now would not be a good time to give away the upside on this exposure.XRX January 2014 3 Calls have a relatively low time cost associated with maintaining a position. Swapping my current holdings for the LEAPS, I can reduce the capital devoted to the situation and wait patiently to see how this plays out.DividendXerox dropped the dividend in February 2001 and restored it in December 2007 at 17 cents per year, paid quarterly, for a yield of 2.5% at Friday's closing price.The payout ratio is 18%, and the dividend may be regarded as secure. Dividends take a back seat to acquisitions and buybacks. Given the history of dropping the dividend, and lack of a regular increase, the shares will not be attractive to dividend-oriented investors.Thoughts on GrowthXerox as presently constituted is the result of a large acquisition - ACS (American Computer Services) in 2010. That's the origin of the Services segment, where the company expects future growth to occur. I owned ACS at the time, attracted by a 5-year revenue growth rate of 9.7%.Checking pro-forma results for the combination, as disclosed in the 10-K, 2009 revenue was $21,082 million, and advanced to $22,626 for 2011, for an annualized growth rate of 3.6%. Combined segment margins on the same basis increased from 7.2% to 9.2%.Under the circumstances, it's not unrealistic to look for growth to resume at 3.5%, when the global economy stabilizes in a growth mode.DebtXerox finances customer leases as a profitable way of supporting Technology sales. This activity is conducted with borrowed money. Assuming a 7:1 leverage ratio of debt to equity as compared with finance assets, the company distinguishes between financial debt and core debt.On that basis, core debt is 29.6% of shareholder equity.The ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred dividends stands at 2.67. General Electric (NYSE:GE), by way of comparison, reports a ratio of 2.04. Xerox limits its financing activities to what is directly supportive of its primary business, while GE has permitted finance to wander into other areas.Miscellaneous Analytical ObservationsServices margins have come under pressure, due to the cost of ramping for large new contracts. It's possible to think of the increased expense as an investment in future income. In any event, margins are expected to increase as revenue from the new contracts comes on line.A slowdown or reversal in the Technology segment improves cash flow, since capital formerly devoted to financing the activity is returned to cash.MIF (machines in the field) is increasing, and installations are still running strong. The MIF metric is indicative of the future annuity type supplies and service revenue from machine sales, and it bodes well for that stream of income.The company provides a wealth of information on signings and sales pipeline. Investors who want to track progress can maintain spreadsheets on a continuing basis and form an impression of future potential.The company regularly does small bolt-on or fold-in acquisitions. Given the cash flow available for the purposes, this strategy can reliably add to growth, or augment capabilities in selected areas of expertise.R&D expenditures are approximately $700 million per year, or 3.1% of revenue. The expense has been declining, both in % and in absolute terms. The company has the ability to stay ahead of the curve in technology areas where it has a stake. As such, it  may be able to gain share against weaker rivals.The strategy of hardware companies moving into software or data services operations, whether by acquisition or internal growth, is very common. XRX was relatively early to the game, and paid a fair price for ACS. Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) may have been excessively zealous in cutting expenses on its acquisition of EDS. Clearly it overpaid for Autonomy, and very possibly it mishandled integration. Computer Services Corporation (CSC) is floundering. The caliber of competition suggests taking share is possible.Disclosure: I am long XRX, HPQ, CB, GE."
611441,21798,2012-05-23T08:19:33-04:00,,"As I looked down at a desk at work, I noticed a calculator with the Xerox (NYSE:XRX) brand on the front facing. That prompted me to do some research to see if the company was still in business (the calculator looked like it was from 1985). That's when I remembered that the commercial with the Michelin Man was actually advertising for Xerox. That made me think, could Xerox be in the position that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or IBM (NYSE:IBM) was in just before their successful comebacks?Apple made a comeback due to significant innovation. It is known for its Macbooks, iPods, iPads, iPhones, etc. When I hear the name Apple, I think of smart thinking, innovation and well-designed devices. When I hear the name Xerox, for some reason, the old yellow robot from the Muppet Movie comes to mind.IBM was able to reinvent itself by focusing its business on information technology. This move has made the company very successful in growing revenue, earnings and stock. I think that Xerox is now in a position to either become a successful turnaround story or turn into another Eastman Kodak (EKDKQ).Xerox just doesn't have a modern stand-out image anymore. The company needs something to propel it to above average earnings growth. The recent commercials do suggest that Xerox can better handle information technology, while allowing other companies to do what they do best. However, something is wrong when the company is only expected to grow earnings annually at 5.2% for the next five years. This is significantly below the average expected earnings growth of the S&P 500 of 10.29%.Maybe Xerox needs to more effectively get the message across to potential customers. I think the next Xerox commercial should feature some of the companies that Xerox has been helping and show how much it has helped. For example, feature employees of a few of these companies saying one sentence, ""Xerox has helped me save X amount of dollars by handling our outsourcing.' It should have 5 people from 5 different companies say this one sentence. Then, the next commercial could show 5 different people from another set of companies saying that sentence. This would get the message out to other potential businesses, better than the Michelin Man throwing tires or papers flying through a wind tunnel.I found an old Xerox commercial from 1979. This commercial shows how innovative the company was back then. Xerox needs to get back to being innovative, not just in its daily operations, but also in marketing its business. The current commercials are just not accomplishing this, in my opinion.The company is clearly undervalued, as it trades under its book value per share. It has solid cash flow and pays a dividend of 2.3%. I think it is on the verge of something great if management can execute properly. The company now needs to find a way to grow earnings at 10% per year or more to have a chance of beating the performance of the S&P 500 for the future. We need to see something better from the company for this to happen. Will it be the next IBM or Apple turnaround story, or the next bankrupt Eastman Kodak? Ms. Ursula Burns, now is the time to make your company great.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Below are my calculations using a FCFF model, multiples comparison and other interesting facts and threats.Discounted Free Cash Flow ValuationIn this article I will run you through my DCF model. In particular I will be using free cash flow to the firm FCFF model to evaluate the stock. Feel free to share your opinion regarding the assumptions I made for this valuation.Let's start with the top line. XRX recorded $22.63B in revenue in 2011, which represented 4.59% growth year/year. In 2012, however, I predict that the company will record modest growth from 2011 to $22.93B (+1.34%), and 2.27% growth in 2013. I predict 2% growth for the next four years.Coming down to the cost side I predict COGS to be 64%, SG&A - 22% and EBIT margin 9-11% of the revenues for the projected period. Interest expense should stay at around 5.5% of the long-term debt. I forecast taxes to be 26% on average for the projected period.Then I subtract increases in working capital and capital expenditures. I model working capital to increase 10% of the revenue increase per annum. Capital expenditures should be approximately 37% of net income.This model uses WACC to discount FCFF backwards to find out the present value. Beta of this stock is 1.57. I project the WACC to be 10.73%.To get the value of the firm we need to discount the projected FCFF by WACC and add the terminal value at the end of the five-year period by calculating a perpetuity with growth of 2% and 10.73% WACC.I get the value of equity by subtracting the market value of debt and adding back current cash and marketable securities.Equity value per share is $12.40, which means the stock is 72% undervalued.Multiples ValuationXRX is also undervalued in terms of P/E (8.00) compared with the industry (13.99) and to one of the biggest direct competitors, Canon Inc. (NYSE:CAJ), which P/E is 15.83. On the other hand, it is similarly valued in terms of P/E, as Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) - 7.71.The situation is similar in terms of P/S. XRX has P/S ratio of 0.43, which is lower than the industry average 0.65 and CAJ - 1.12, but slightly higher than HPQ - 0.35.Analyst ratingsThe median analyst target price for XRX is $9, which shows more than 25% upside potential. In the last 30 days four analysts have increased the EPS revisions for the current year and two analysts for the next year.More positive factsThreatsFinancial data taken from Yahoo Finance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

949681,27231,2012-10-25T10:35:09-04:00,,"We have been following Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) since the middle of January largely because David Einhorn (Greenlight Capital) had purchased 17M shares of the company in Q4 2011. We were attracted to the company because it had purchased Affiliated Computer Services in 2010 and we liked how Xerox was transitioning its revenue exposure from hardware towards IT and Business Process Operations Services.We were especially pleased with ourselves in that we decided to watch for a perfect pitch with this company because if we had purchased shares on January 18 (when Greenlight revealed its Xerox purchase), we would be down 22% in the nine months that we heard about Greenlight green-lighting its re-entry into Xerox. Then again, Xerox is down 13% based on Einhorn's initial cost of $7.61/share.We agree with Einhorn that there is value in Xerox because we have decided to begin formally covering and publishing our analysis and evaluations of the company and Einhorn has reinforced his conviction in the company through the additional purchase of 9M shares during 2012. Although it has seen soft performance this year, we like that it is at a 30% discount to book value.Click to enlargeSource: Morningstar DirectXerox's GuidanceDue to the weak economic environment of the eurozone, Xerox continues to report sour results. We think it is becoming a trend on Xerox's part to meet consensus adjusted estimates and to reduce forward guidance and also to announce ""non-recurring restructuring charges"" that are ""excluded from adjusted EPS guidance"".Following Xerox has been like water torture not because the stock has gone down by 22% since we began increasing our research on it, but because the company has been steadily reporting guidance that has been soft and sour. The good news for us is that we did not force ourselves to ""buy in a panicky mood"" and suffer through the slings and arrows of a 22% decline in the face of a 16% increase in the S&P 500.At the beginning of 2012, Xerox issued adjusted EPS guidance of $1.12-$1.18. As of its most recent quarter, the company has once again revised its guidance down to a range of $1.07-$1.09, down from $1.07-$1.12 in Q2 2012.Source: Xerox's 2012 Earnings ReportsXerox's Recent ResultsXerox recently announced soft financial results. As expected, strength in its Business Process Outsourcing and its Information Technology Outsourcing businesses was offset by soft performance in its Document Outsourcing business and its Technology equipment, services and peripherals division.Concerns We Have About Xerox and its ManagementWe can understand why investors have concerns about Xerox. Ursula Burns has been President/CEO since April 2007 and the company's stock has declined by 60% in that time frame. Xerox earned $1.22 in reported EPS in 2006, the year before Burns became President. Despite spending over $4.1B in acquisitions and $2.6B on share repurchases, Xerox's Adjusted EPS is expected to be $1.08 and its reported EPS is expected to be $.85 after accounting for acquisition-related intangible amortization and restructuring charges.Part of our apprehensiveness with regards to jumping into Xerox alongside Greenlight Capital is because we were concerned that the weak macroeconomic environment was an excuse for poor management and execution issues. Considering the poor results we have seen under Ursula Burns, we think investors should do the same.Source: Morningstar Direct and Xerox's Most Recent GuidanceFinancial PositionWhile the company is lugging around $9.3B in short- and long-term debt, it is largely offset by $6.2B in finance receivables and equipment leases, as well as $1.44B in investments in equity affiliates. The company has a common shareholders' equity base of $12.2B, however $11.9B is due to goodwill and intangible assets from acquisitions.The company's cash flow patterns are seasonal in which it generates the lion's share of its cash collections in the fourth quarter of a fiscal year. The company generated $1.344B in free cash flows on its $12.2B equity base over the trailing twelve months, which was sharply lower than the $1.865B achieved in 2009 before the ACS acquisition. We don't consider ACS to be a deal from hell though because we can see that the ACS IT Services operation strength is offsetting weakness in the legacy Xerox operations.For the purpose of our free cash flow calculation, we included acquisition spending as a free cash flow outflow against operating cash flows because the company has been making acquisitions on a recurring basis and its operating cash flows benefit from the increased depreciation and amortization adjustments to net income, which also reduce taxable income and cash-based tax payments.Source: Morningstar DirectComparisonComparison While Xerox has seen soft results and issued a sour outlook, we believe that it compares well against its IT outsourcing competition (or at least if we were not to count its underperformance against Accenture (NYSE:ACN). Besides Accenture, we would compare Xerox against Hewlett-Packard's (NYSE:HPQ) HP Services division and Dell Inc.'s (DELL-OLD) Dell Services segment.Xerox gets 52% of its MRQ revenue from its services and solutions versus 100% for Accenture, 32% for HPQ and 21% for Dell. Xerox's Services Division generated 4.8% revenue growth year-over-year in 2012 YTD versus -1% for HP Services and 1% for Dell Services. The one area that Xerox Services has shown some material weakness relative to its IT Services peers is its operating margin because it operates exclusively in outsourcing services, while its peers are also involved in IT consulting and other higher-value-added services.We have seen Xerox's outsourcing services operating margins pressured recently due to the ramp-up of new service contracts, as well as concessions extended to certain customers in order to retain business. Our thesis going into this conclusion was that although Xerox may not be Accenture, at least it isn't HP Services or Dell Services and we can conclude that our thesis here holds.Source: MRQ Reports for Accenture, Xerox, H-P and DellConclusionIn conclusion, we believe that Einhorn was premature in green-lighting a re-entry into Xerox. We can understand why he wanted to get back into it though. We were attracted to the company and we were surprised at its soft performance and sour guidance. The reason why we are continuing to follow the company is because of its 30% discount to book value as well as David Einhorn's 2% stake in Xerox.We also like that Franklin Mutual Advisers (Michael Price's old shop) owns 6.75% of Xerox for four of its mutual funds (Franklin Mutual Shares Securities, Mutual Global Discovery, Mutual Shares, Mutual Quest and Mutual Beacon) and that although it isn't as strong as IT Solutions leader Accenture, at least it is in better shape than Dell and Hewlett-Packard.We believe that investors should carefully analyze and evaluate Xerox to determine when it stops muddling through the muck and morass of mediocrity caused by the eurozone debt crisis before buying into it. At the same time, we believe that the company offers investors a solid level of cash flow generation and margin of safety.We believe investors interested in Xerox should approach it with the care and due diligence reserved for special situation and turnaround plays in order to minimize potential losses and getting in too early.Disclosure: I am long ACN.

In Xerox's (NYSE:XRX) case, we think the firm is fairly valued at $10 per share, significantly higher than where it is currently trading.For some background, we think a comprehensive analysis of a firm's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best. In the spirit of transparency, we show how the performance of our VBI has stacked up per underlying score:(Click to enlarge)If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. Xerox posts a VBI score of 3 on our scale, reflecting our 'fairly valued' DCF assessment of the company, its neutral relative valuation versus peers, and bearish technicals. We prefer firms that have scores of 9 and 10, as it has been shown that a cohort of stocks with attractive value and momentum qualities have great potential for outperformance. Our white paper outlining this conclusion can be downloaded here.We use Cintas Corp (NASDAQ:CTAS) R.R. Donnelley (NYSE:RRD), Iron Mountain (NYSE:IRM), and Pitney Bowes (NYSE:PBI) for our peer group analysis.Our Report on XeroxIn the spirit of transparency, our report on Xerox and hundreds of other companies can be found here. (Click to enlarge)Investment Considerations(Click to enlarge)Investment HighlightsAlthough Xerox has put up decent economic profits during the past few years, these returns have not come without volatility. Such business performance indicates heightened risk with respect to the firm's ability to continue to put up strong results.The company looks fairly valued at this time. We expect the firm to trade within our fair value estimate range for the time being. If the firm's share price fell below $7, we'd take a closer look.Xerox's cash flow generation is robust, but its financial leverage could potentially be concerning down the road. If cash flows begin to weaken, we'd become more cautious on the firm's overall financial health.The firm's share price performance has trailed that of the market during the past quarter. However, it is trading within our fair value estimate range, so we don't view such activity as alarming.The firm sports a very nice dividend yield of 2.2%. We expect the firm to pay out about 15% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends. However, we're not considering the firm for addition to the portfolio in our Dividend Growth Newsletter, as we think there are better income ideas out there.Business Quality(Click to enlarge)Economic Profit AnalysisThe best measure of a firm's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (OTC:WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the firm's economic profit spread. Xerox's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 8.3%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 7.7%. As such, we assign the firm a ValueCreation™ rating of GOOD. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Cash Flow Analysis(Click to enlarge)Firms that generate a free cash flow margin (free cash flow divided by total revenue) above 5% are usually considered cash cows. Xerox's free cash flow margin has averaged about 10% during the past 3 years. As such, we think the firm's cash flow generation is relatively STRONG. The free cash flow measure shown above is derived by taking cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and differs from enterprise free cash flow (FCFF), which we use in deriving our fair value estimate for the company. At Xerox, cash flow from operations decreased about 11% from levels registered two years ago, while capital expenditures expanded about 160% over the same time period.Valuation AnalysisOur discounted cash flow model indicates that Xerox's shares are worth between $7.00 - $14.00 each. The margin of safety around our fair value estimate is driven by the firm's HIGH ValueRisk™ rating, which is derived from the historical volatility of key valuation drivers. The estimated fair value of $10 per share represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 10.7 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 8.9 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 1% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the firm's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 8.7%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 9.3%, which is above Xerox 's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, we assume free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 1.4% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. For Xerox, we use a 7.7% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Margin of Safety Analysisall future free cash flows. Although we estimate the firm's fair value at about $10 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock. In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Xerox. We think the firm is attractive below $7 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $14 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the firm, in our opinion.(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Future Path of Fair ValueWe estimate Xerox's fair value at this point in time to be about $10 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the firm's current share price with the path of Xerox's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the firm's shares three years hence. This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the firm's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $13 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $10 increased at an annual rate of the firm's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.(Click to enlarge)Pro Forma Financial Statements(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)(Click to enlarge)Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

As a result, it trades under book value (!) despite an ROE greater than 10% and operating margins in the high single digits.Before you dismiss this company out of hand as a dinosaur, consider that this is not your father's Xerox. Just as we've recently seen how Dell is no longer the PC company you thought it was (and therefore may be undervalued as well), neither is Xerox the copier/printer maker of yesteryear. Today, Xerox derives the majority of its revenues and profits from the sale of services (business process, IT and document outsourcing).And much of these revenues are continuous and predictable; Xerox brags that 83% of its sales are ""annuity-based"" (up from 82% last year). With many of its sales under contract, but with no one company making up a significant amount of the company's revenue, Xerox can likely be counted on for sustained earnings.Furthermore, these earnings appear likely to grow. Xerox has been growing revenues at about a 9% per year pace over each of the last three years, and services revenues are expected to grow in the mid-single digits this year as more companies are added under contract. Management also expects margins to expand throughout the year as process improvements allow it to deliver under its services contracts at lower costs.But there are some issues of which shareholders should be aware. The company does carry almost $10 billion in debt (compared to operating income of $1.5 billion). But it's worth noting that Xerox also finances customer purchases, and has been doing so for years. These finance receivables generate profits for the company, and currently add up to $6 billion, funded to a large extent by this debt.Xerox also has a pension and retirement plan that is underfunded on the order of $3 billion. While the company only has to pay a nominal amount into its pension plan this year, unless plan asset returns are higher than expected (currently estimated at 6.9% per year) or payouts are lower than expected, this is likely to be a cash drain for the company over the next several years.There is also the risk that the company deploys more money towards acquisitions that don't pay off. The company has a history of M&A activity, diverting cash flow that could otherwise be used to buy back shares at what is currently a high earnings yield. The fact that management presents an ""adjusted"" earnings figure that excludes the amortization of intangibles (which were likely paid for as parts of acquisitions) suggests Xerox doesn't see the price paid for acquisitions as particularly important!With sustainable earnings that are growing, however, it's hard to go wrong at an earnings yield of 13%! Xerox pays a dividend and buys back shares, and therefore may make for a compelling investment at its current price despite its shortcomings.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in XRX over the next 72 hours."
538681,24866,2012-04-27T19:11:42-04:00,,"In this article, I will run you through a DCF model on Xerox (NYSE:XRX) and argue why the company could and should be taken over by either Dell (DELL-OLD) (see here for why), Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) (see here for why) or other companies looking to expand operations in business process outsourcing (""BPO""). I find that Xerox is substantially undervalued and can close this discount by being acquired.First, let's begin with an assumption about the top-line. Xerox finished FY2011 with $22.6B in revenue, which represented a 4.6% gain off of the preceding year. I model 7.4% per annum growth over the next half decade or so, which is fairly conservative considering that it is around 340 bps below what is expected for the S&P 500 over the same time period.Moving onto the cost-side of the equation, there are several items to consider: Operating expenses, capital expenditures and taxes. I model cost of goods sold as 65% of revenue versus 22% for SG&A, 3.5% for R&D, and 2.1% for capex. Taxes are estimated at 30% of adjusted EBIT (ie. excluding non-cash depreciation charges to keep this a pure operating model.)We then need to subtract out net increases in working capital. I expect this figure to hover around 0.45% of revenue over the explicitly projected time period.Taking a perpetual growth rate of 2.5% and discounting backwards by a WACC of 10% yields a fair value figure of $10.82, implying around 40% upside. This valuation is merited if the company hits free cash flow of nearly $2B in 2017. The market is pricing in a WACC of 11.5%, which is much too bearish (especially in light of the already conservative inputs going into this model.)All of this falls within the context of the company needing greater momentum:In my view, added momentum could close the discount to intrinsic value. This added momentum will come from being acquired by companies looking to expand operations in BPO. Xerox currently trades at a respective 8.8x and 6.3x past and forward earnings versus 8.7x and 7.5x for Dell and 8.8x and 5.6x for HP.Both Dell and HP are viewed as old-fashioned and out-dated businesses that are at the very mature stages of the business game. However, technology has few barriers to entry and the market has failed to account for this in valuing Dell and HP (see the article links included above). By buying out Xerox, Dell and HP can cross-sell products while expanding Xerox services and businesses to a global audience. Note, however, that HP's CEO has specifically expressed a disinterest in acquiring companies as large as Xerox, at least within the next year.Consensus estimates for Dell's EPS forecast are that it will stay flat at around $2.15 over the next three years. Assuming a multiple of 7.5x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $2.15, the stock is more or less fairly valued. This is a very low multiple and thus the stock is well positioned to gain with a beta of 1.4 in a full recovery.HP requires even less of a multiple to be fairly valued.Consensus estimates for HP's EPS forecast are that it will decline by 17.2% to $4.04 and then turnaround to grow by 9.2% and 7.5% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 12.5x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $4.37, the stock would more than double. I highly recommend a strategic investment in all three of these companies.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
521411,29371,2012-04-24T09:58:13-04:00,,"Xerox (NYSE:XRX) was founded in 1906 in Rochester but it later relocated to Southern New England where its headquarters are today. The company is known for technological innovation with more than 10,000 active patents. However, its main business of printing has been in distress since the 1990s, caused by the internet and the digitalization of documents. Investors are skeptical about Xerox because it still relies on its printing business with over 40% of revenue generated by this segment in 2011. I think that there is little to be concerned about. Xerox is successfully transforming itself into a service oriented company after the Affiliated Computer Services acquisition in early 2010. The company strategy is to continue to acquire more service oriented competitors in the next few years. From a valuation standpoint, Xerox appears to be undervalued and the stock is a good long-term investment. Also, Xerox is led by a remarkably capable management team which should help the stock price increase.Xerox is moving from a hardware company to a more service-based company. This transition reminds me of a similar move by IBM (NYSE:IBM) about ten years ago which was successful. In the previous decade, IBM sold its computer hardware business (known today as Lenovo) and acquired PricewaterhouseCoopers' (its accountant) consulting business. In a similar way, a large part of Xerox's growth and transformation today is due to its acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services. This deal transformed Xerox overnight from a company with double digit declining revenues in 2009 to a company with 5% revenue growth in 2011. Xerox continues to acquire companies at a healthy pace. In 2011, it spent over $200 million in acquisitions. Xerox plans to spend $300 to $400 million on buying other companies, mostly in services, in 2012. This should provide a healthy level of cash flow and revenue growth for the company in the coming years.Xerox stock has been recently trading around $8 per share and the company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.045 per share for an annualized yield of about 2.1%. The company has 1.35 billion shares outstanding, a market capitalization of $10.8 billion, and an enterprise value of $18.5 billion which includes cash of $1 billion and long-term debt of $7 billion. Recently, Xerox raised $1.1 billion through a senior notes offering. This increase in capital suggests that it is either going to acquire a big company or spend more on share repurchases. Currently, the company has an authorization to repurchase its own shares in the amount of $1.3 billion. It repurchased 87.9 million shares for an aggregate price of $701 million in 2011. Part of the repurchased shares are used to contribute to the company's defined contribution pension plan (16.6 million shares in 2011) and to offset the issuance of stock option awards. However, shareholders also benefit from share repurchases. Due to stock buy-backs there is usually more demand for the shares being repurchased. Also, as the amount of shares decreases the earnings per share rise.I expect Xerox to earn $1.05 per share in 2012, which is higher than the company's estimate of $0.97 to $1.03. The main reasons for being so optimistic are that the U.S. Government extended the tax benefits under IRS Section 179 for purchases of new equipment into 2012. Second, the IMF recently increased its estimate for 2012 economic growth from 3.3% to 3.5%. And lastly, as companies try to simplify their operations they will increasingly take advantage of Xerox's service offerings. Thus, I estimate that the 2012 price to earnings ratio for Xerox is about 7.6 which compares favorably to its main competitor, Canon (NYSE:CAJ), whose 2012 estimated price to earnings ratio is 17.7. Canon is slightly more profitable than Xerox. It has earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and net income margins of 18% and 7%, respectively, compared to 13.5% and 5.2%, respectively, for Xerox. However, Canon has a greater exposure to consumer goods such as digital cameras and camcorders. I see demand for these products decreasing as cell phones and other smart devices offer digital cameras in ever rising quality. Also, in 2011 Canon's revenues decreased 4%, while Xerox's were up 5%. Assuming a more reasonable price to earnings ratio for Xerox of 10, the stock should trade above $10 per share. This is a rise of 25% from the current price level. While I cannot predict if and when this price target will be achieved, the dividend yield is secure. Being paid 2.1% tax-advantaged dividend on your capital per year at current historically low interest rates with the potential for significant capital appreciation is a good proposition.Looking forward, I believe Xerox will be able to execute well on its strategy. The main reason is that it has a great management team that is being overseen by a capable board of directors. Xerox's board of directors includes such business leaders as Citigroup's former chairman and CEO (Charles Prince), Procter & Gamble's current chairman and CEO (Robert McDonald) and the Center for Adoption Policy's current executive director (Ann Reese) among others. Most importantly, Ursula Burns is the CEO who currently leads Xerox. Ursula Burns has steered Xerox successfully through the last couple of years transitioning the company to services. In her short tenure at the top spot, Ms. Burns has earned a number of recognitions including the 27th most powerful woman in the world in 2011 according to Forbes and the top twenty list of black female CEOs according to the Washington Post. In addition, Ursula Burns is on the White House Committee on Science, Technology and Math Education along with a former Intel CEO and a well-known female astronaut. Many companies' shares carry leadership discounts. The most striking example being a Xerox competitor, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), which has involuntarily changed its leadership seven times in the past thirteen years. In the case of Xerox, there should be a leadership premium, mainly because of its CEO.Overall, I think Xerox has good prospects and its stock at the current price offers an attractive valuation. Xerox is still going through restructuring and there are risks such as changing the company from a printing technology manufacturer to a comprehensive business services provider. I think a positive outcome, from which shareholders are well-positioned to benefit, is most likely and I recommend considering Xerox's shares.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The printer business is extremely competitive with companies like Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) trying to take valuable share away from XRX. XRX's nine straight quarters of market share increases show that the company is doing things right.ValuationXRX trades at just 8.8 times past earnings and 6.4 times forward earnings. In addition to the low PE ratio, XRX trades at just 0.89 times book value. All of these metrics support XRX as a value play.DividendXRX currently pays a dividend of 17 cents per share or 2.15%. While this is not a huge dividend, it is certainly more than most technology companies pay. Also, XRX pays out just under 19% of earnings. XRX could easily afford to raise the dividend significantly in the future.ConclusionWhile XRX has not been a top performing stock of far in 2012, it is time to take another look at the company.

We continue to believe the shares look undervalued. In the spirit of transparency, we make available our DCF model template here.Revenue growth from the company's services businesses advanced 6% in the quarter, but such growth was offset by a 5% decline in revenue from its technology businesses. Strength in the firm's services businesses was driven by an increase in both business process outsourcing and document outsourcing, while its technology business saw weakness in the sale of document systems and supplies. Management blamed the poor economic environment in Europe for its subpar revenue performance.We continue to like Xerox's services portfolio and believe that it has a competitive advantage in providing its clients cost-efficient ways to more productively run their enterprises. However, the increased services signings continue to pressure gross margins due to the large upfront costs to initiate such contracts. The firm's fourth-quarter gross margin fell to 32.2% from 33.6%, a decline of 140 basis points. The firm's operating margin also fell 40 basis points, to 10%, as lower research & development and overhead costs failed to mitigate the gross-margin weakness. On an adjusted basis, the firm earned $0.33 per share, up 14% from the same period a year ago and matching consensus expectations. Xerox continues to be a cash cow, hauling in over $1.6 billion in free cash flow during 2011.Looking ahead, the company expects first-quarter 2012 adjusted earnings per share in the range of $0.21 to $0.24 (consensus was at $0.24), while full-year 2012 adjusted earnings per share are expected to grow about 9% on the high end of its guided range of $1.12 to $1.18 (consensus was at $1.16), including restructuring. The firm's cash-flow outlook was particularly impressive, with the firm anticipating nearly $2.3 billion in cash flow from operations in 2012; this compares to $1.96 billion in cash flow from operations in 2011.Overall, we're still cautious on Xerox. For one, we'd like to see more sustainable revenue expansion, and we're not yet sure how results will shape up after the annual lapping of its defined-benefit pension plans freeze and its multi-thousand worker layoff. Plus, Xerox's massive debt load will continue to inhibit restructuring efforts and strategic initiatives.

480001,20297,2012-04-05T03:25:12-04:00,,"On the surface Xerox Corp. (NYSE:XRX) smells a lot like its Nifty 50 brethren, once-hotter-than-the-sun-but-now-bankrupt Eastman Kodak Co. (EKDKQ) and Polaroid Corp. Its stock has gone nowhere since forever. But Xerox was not your typical overvalued blue chip of the 1990s, like Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT), whose earnings have tripled or quadrupled since then — the kind of stocks I have advocated in this column. Xerox was very pricey in the late ’90s, but its revenue and earnings per share have since declined. And to make matters worse, printing and copying is just so analog, so last century. It is hard to get excited about a company making equipment whose main trick is putting ink on paper. However, all these negative optics have resulted in one misunderstood company and a very mispriced stock.Though we think of Xerox as a company that sells copiers, that represents only 20 percent of its revenue. About one third of revenue comes from selling toner and servicing copiers — a beautiful, high-margin, annuity­like business. Look around your desk, and you’ll still see plenty of paper; the death of printing and copying has been greatly exaggerated. It is very ungreen of us, but we still copy and print.Xerox’s story gets better. About half of its revenue comes from services. Xerox is a giant in the document-outsourcing business, which provides about one sixth of its revenue. Corporate customers, sick of paper cuts and spilled toner, realize that managing copiers and printers is not their core competency, so they let Xerox take care of that. This has been a very nicely growing business, up 6 percent in the fourth quarter.About one third of Xerox’s revenue comes from its business-process-outsourcing service. Xerox got into this business in 2010 when it bought Affiliated Computer Services. It paid fair value for ACS, but it had to issue a lot of undervalued stock to finance the purchase. ACS was touted as a transformative acquisition for Xerox; unlike most such acquisitions, which often destroy value, this one is turning out to be as good as Xerox’s management proclaimed it to be. Xerox helped ACS go international; ACS gave Xerox access to its domestic customers. This acquisition has resulted in several hundred new deals. The integration has gone smoothly. The CEO of ACS is still running the business, and new-contract signings are up by double digits.Last year was not kind to Xerox. The company sources $2 billion worth of parts from Japan each year and got hit hard by the earthquake and tsunami, which created supply shortages. Xerox had to fly copiers to its customers to make sure they got them on time; its gross margins took it on the chin. In addition, the relentless ascent of the Japanese yen — up 50 percent against the dollar in three years — hurt Xerox’s cost of goods sold. But tsunamis are unlikely to become annual events, and the yen will probably decline in the long run given that Japan is the most indebted nation in the world, has one of the oldest populations and is very dependent on the health of the shaky Chinese economy.Declining interest rates resulted in a lower pension discount rate and forced Xerox to contribute $200 million to pension assets. But pensions will turn from a headwind into a tailwind in the future: First, Xerox closed its defined benefit plan in 2011; second, though interest rates may decline further, in the long run they’ll likely rise, boosting Xerox’s cash flows.At first blush, Xerox appears to have a very leveraged balance sheet, laden with $8.6 billion of debt. However, $6 billion of it is finance debt that is secured by equipment and leveraged 7-to-1 (if our banks had had this leverage, we would not have had a financial crisis). Xerox has $2.6 billion in corporate debt, which it can pay off in a little more than a year from its free cash flow.Because 80 percent of Xerox’s revenue is an annuitylike stream, the company is a cash machine, spitting out about $2 billion of free cash flow a year. Management has been very specific on what it intends to do with the cash: pay down debt, continue to pay a dividend (the stock currently yields about 2 percent), spend about $1 billion on stock buybacks and make a few small tuck-in acquisitions. Xerox will be able to buy 8 to 10 percent of its shares outstanding this year.The company’s service revenue should continue to grow 5 to 10 percent a year; assuming the copier business is flat, overall revenue should grow in the low single digits. As profit margins rise, Xerox should be able to grow earnings in the midteens without doing much heavy lifting. The best part is that the current valuation of less than six times free cash flow sets the bar very low for this company. It needs to show proof of life (of which it has plenty), not proof of growth."
375111,25432,2012-02-17T12:37:48-05:00,,"To me, Xerox (NYSE:XRX) simply meant to make a paper copy. Xerox happened to create a powerful brand that turned its name into a verb for a generic action: making duplicates. Just like Kleenex (NYSE:KMB) did with tissues and Coke (NYSE:KO) with sodas, Xerox developed deep brand and franchise value. With the current share price around $8.30/share, the market appears to be valuing Xerox as if it were a relic of the past and discounting the real growth story at Xerox - its evolution towards a service oriented business process outsourcer. It's a sign of the times: a more digital world, means less need for paper copies, and therefore, a diminishing need for the capital intensive printers and copiers that Xerox is known for. So while the printer and copier business is stagnant, Xerox's business process outsourcing services are producing steady growth and profitability which I do not think the market is capturing in the share price.Business Overview:I was surprised to see how low the stock price for Xerox had become after reading some articles on Seeking Alpha, so I decided to do some more investigation because a low stock price does not necessarily make a stock a bargain. Only if that low stock price is less than the value of the proportional piece of the business that it represents does it make it a bargain. Here is what I found.Creative Destruction:Joseph Schumpeter said it best: In short, capitalism and innovation create new industries, and destroy old ones. Xerox, at one time, was on the former side of the equation, by creating a new industry to increase office productivity. Its a bit ironic that Xerox now is blowing the gales of creative destruction for the printer and copier industry itself created as it moves towards competing in the digital age with the likes of IBM (NYSE:IBM) and Accenture (NYSE:ACN). It turns out, Xerox's real value proposition is increasing office efficiency whether its through document reproduction, or by taking over the back office operations of its clients.Business Performance:In 2011, Xerox recorded net income of $1.3 billion, or $0.90 per diluted share on $22.6 billion in sales (if certain noncash and/or one time charges are excluded, an adjusted $1.08 earnings per share results). Breaking the sales figures down further, Xerox's Technology sales (i.e., printers and copiers) were down 1% year-over-year and made up 32% of total sales while Service revenues (i.e., business process outsourcing) were up 8% year-over-year and comprised about 66% of sales. The remaining sales generally come from leasing arrangements with customers, and are insignificant to this analysis. On the whole, sales were up 5% year-over-year in a very challenging 2011 due to macro level events.So that begs the question, in a less challenging environment, how fast can Xerox grow? I anticipate an 8-10% growth in Service revenue is achievable, while a 3-4% increase in Technology sales appears conservative. Based on those growth rates and the breakdown of sales, Xerox as a whole could approach a 7% sales growth rate. Combine that steady growth with the cost cutting (read: job cutting) measures being carried out and shareholder friendly capital allocation (read: undervalued share buybacks and dividend payouts), and the ingredients for solid business performance surface, at least from the shareholder perspective at current price levels.Value Indicators:While Xerox's business prospects appear fairly robust and sustainable, what are some of the indicators that make its equity undervalued? Here are a few that I see:For a high school chemistry field trip, I visited a Xerox facility and observed engineers working on ink printer and color technology. At that time, Xerox was overvalued, and its primary printer and copier business was eroding. Some years later, it pains me that a number of those engineers are losing their jobs, but it reminds that Joseph Schumpeter's premise remains true: Creative destruction renders some jobs obsolete, but it will undoubtedly create new ones, in other modern, innovative industries. Likewise, creative destruction sometimes spawns investment opportunities when investors don't quite understand the turnaround story. Xerox now appears quite undervalued for patient value investors.Disclosure: I am long XRX."

Fourth quarter results met expectations, but Wall Street was disappointed in the company's guidance for 2012: GAAP earnings between 97 cents and $1.03 per share, with adjusted earnings per share expected between $1.12 and $1.18. That low level of projected earnings growth -- about 11% at the GAAP midpoint, 6.5% non-GAAP -- is apparently what led to stock's sharp decline.The question investors should be asking is, who on Earth would be surprised by this? The stock is trading at 8.6 trailing GAAP earnings, and 7.2 times adjusted earnings. Even before the earnings miss, XRX had a single-digit P/E by any measurement. That low multiple was supposedly due to -- wait for it -- the company's slow level of growth. As such, the sharp move downward on slightly lowered growth forecasts seems unreasonable.Xerox is what it is -- and the stock's move down over the past few sessions has made ""what it is"" more attractive. The balance sheet is a bit heavy -- long-term debt is $8.6 billion, about 80% of market cap, with total long-term liabilities net of cash about 16% over the company's market value. Earnings growth is unspectacular, at best.The company's Services division now outsells its legacy copier and printer products, but margins were compressed in 2011 by weakness in Europe, an issue the company expects to continue in 2012. Its dividend yield of 2.2% offers a higher rate than the 10-year Treasury bill, but remains lower than many other large-cap US equities.But Xerox is also trading below its book value and at less than seven times forward adjusted earnings. The company generates tremendous cash; levered cash flow from 2009-2011 (defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and interest costs) was over $4 billion, about 40% of the company's market capitalization. In its fourth quarter conference call, the company guided for 2012 free cash flow of $1.5 to $1.8 billion, putting levered cash flow in the range of $1.15 to $1.5 billion, depending on interest costs and the company's ability to pay down debt. If the company meets guidance, it will be the fourth consecutive year that the company has generated over a billion dollars in cash:XRX Levered Cash Flow, 2009-2012Data from company reports and SEC filings; market cap is $10.33B based on Monday's close of $7.73 and share count from Q4 earnings; may differ from other public data 1 At midpoint of company guidance for free cash flow of $1.5-$1.8 billion (based on $2.0-$2.3 billion in operating cash flow, less $500MM in capital expenditures), less 2011 interest expense of $328 million. Company is not guiding to lower net debt in 2012.On average, from 2009 to 2012, the company's levered cash flow yield will be 13.9%, an excellent return in any market. The company plans to use the cash generated in 2012 for minor acquisitions -- hoping to create a little more growth -- and to buy back roughly $1 billion in stock, nearly 10% of shares outstanding.The ""bit softer"" earnings forecast does little to change the bull forecast for XRX. (And those earnings were, actually, just a bit softer; the company's guided range for adjusted earnings of $1.12-$1.18 came in against an analyst consensus of $1.16 for 2012, according to Barron's.)Xerox is not a growth play; it is a long-term value play. The company must continue to manage its expenses, must continue to create modest top-line growth (total revenue in 2011 rose 5%), and must continue to create substantial cost savings from restructuring and synergy gains, which totaled $400MM in 2011, according to the Q4 earnings presentation (pdf).If the company can successfully stay on that path, it will continue to successfully generate tremendous amounts of cash. And if Xerox continues to generate over a billion dollars annually, patient, long-term investors will be rewarded. European weakness and short-term margin troubles simply don't change that thesis, but the 10% drop in the stock in response to those problems provides an even stronger entry point.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

317427,24491,2012-01-04T16:13:58-05:00,,"In this article, let's evaluate the dividend of Xerox (NYSE:XRX). Our full report, which we summarize below, on Xerox can be found here.(Click image to expand)We think the safety of Xerox's dividend is POOR. We measure the safety of the dividend in a unique but very straightforward fashion. As many know, earnings can fluctuate in any given year, so using the payout ratio in any given year has some limitations. Plus, companies can often encounter unforeseen charges (read hiccups in operations), which makes earnings an even less-than-predictable measure of the safety of the dividend in any given year. We know that companies won't cut the dividend just because earnings have declined or they had a restructuring charge that put them in the red for the quarter (year). Therefore, we think that assessing the cash flows of a business allows us to determine whether it has the capacity to continue paying these cash outlays well into the future.As such, we've developed the forward-looking Valuentum Dividend Cushion. The measure is a ratio that sums the existing cash a company has on hand plus its expected future free cash flows over the next five years and divides that sum by future expected dividends over the same time period. Basically, if the score is above 1, the company has the capacity to pay out its expected future dividends. As income investors, however, we'd like to see a score much larger than 1 for a couple reasons: 1) the higher the ratio, the more ""cushion"" the company has against unexpected earnings shortfalls, and 2) the higher the ratio, the greater capacity a dividend-payer has in boosting the dividend in the future. For Xerox, this score is 1.2 offering only a modest ""cushion"" and very little excess capacity for future dividend growth. Therefore, we rate its dividend safety as POOR.Now on to growth. As we mentioned above, we think the larger the ""cushion"" the larger capacity it has to raise the dividend. However, such dividend growth analysis is not complete until after considering management's willingness to increase the dividend. As such, we evaluate the company's historical dividend track record. If there have been no dividend cuts in 10 years and the company has a nice growth rate, its future potential dividend growth is EXCELLENT, which unfortunately is not the case for Xerox. We think Xerox's potential dividend growth is VERY POOR, as the dividend has been stable the past several years and the company's finances reveal little capacity for future growth.However, because capital preservation is also an important consideration for income investors, we assess the risk associated with the potential for capital loss (offering dividend investors a complete picture). In Xerox's case, we think the shares are undervalued, so the risk of capital loss is LOW. This is one of the few things income investors have going for them with a position in Xerox.All things considered, we're more interested in Xerox's equity valuation than its dividend at this time. Its shares are cheap, but the dividend looks weak. As a result, we think it'd be a better fit for our Best Ideas list as opposed to the portfolio in our Dividend Growth Newsletter.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

I have received several emails asking about XRX, pointing to the fact that the company trades below book value, is profitable, and generates significant free cash flows. I thought it would be worth taking a closer look.The printing business tends to exhibit the attractive characteristic of providing for relatively stable revenues and cash flows. This is due to the fact that many businesses in this industry generate sales from “bundled lease arrangements” in which the customer pays a single monthly price over a lease term for equipment, service, supplies and financing, plus a smaller variable component for page volumes in excess of a contractual minimum. Unlike companies that are reliant on recurring one-time product sales or signing new contracts each year, companies like XRX enjoy the fruits of their labour for many years after the customer is initially signed. This stability makes the valuation job relatively easier (at least, for this portion of the business).Let’s begin with the company’s historical returns.Xerox Corporation - Historical Returns, 1995 - 2010This first chart shows relatively lackluster returns, though these might be understated as indicated by the consistent double digit cash returns. Where cash returns exceed income statement based returns metrics over a long period of time, this suggests the presence of recurring non-cash expenses. Free cash flow ultimately drives investment returns, so it is worth digging deeper even though, on most metrics returns look week.Also worth noting is that the company’s returns on equity have been consistently above “enterprise” based figures that are based on returns to all sources of capital, suggesting significant leverage. We’ll discuss this in more detail below.Xerox Corporation - Revenues and Margins, 1995 - 2010This chart goes to support the contention that the company has relatively stable revenues, as a result of its annuity-like contracts. Unfortunately, we also see very little growth in the top line, which is indicative of industry maturity and the stability of the company’s market share.In 2010 we see sudden and dramatic top line growth, but alas this is not the result of organic growth but rather a large acquisition. In February 2010, the company purchased Affiliated Computer Services, Inc. (“ACS”), a provider of business process outsourcing services. The ACS transaction was valued at approximately $8.5 billion (including $6.9 billion in cash and stock, the repayment of $1.7 billion of debt and assumption of a further $0.6 billion of debt). At the time of the transaction, ACS had a book value of $2.7 billion, though negative tangible equity of (0.64) billion. On an asset basis, this does appear quite expensive. ACS generated average free cash flow over the preceding five years of $453 million, representing a P/AvgFCF of 18.7x. So, on a cash flow basis, the acquisition still appears expensive. This suggests that XRX is highly reliant on future improvement in ACS’s fortunes in order to justify the purchase. Let’s take a look at the company’s revenue sources and costs of each.Xerox Corporation - Revenue Sources, 1995 - 2010This chart shows the growing importance of services to the company’s top line, which is the result of the ACS acquisition. It also appears that ACS enjoyed lower gross margins than XRX, as we see the cost of services revenue increasing significantly in 2010 in conjunction with the ACS acquisition.Xerox Corporation - Cash Flows, 1995 - 2010Here’s the real meat of the argument. XRX generates sizable cash flows, and has done so relatively consistently in all years since 1999 except for 2000 and 2008. Moreover, judging by the tight coupling of cash flows from operations and free cash flows, the company has low capital demands. Given the ACS acquisition, it is especially important to not focus on the relatively higher 2010 free cash flows and CFOs. When company A acquires company B, company A gets all of company B’s receivables, but does not have the associated cash outflows that were required to generate those receivables. As those receivables are collected, this results in a temporary boost to cash flows from operations, making this an unreliable indicator of future ability to generate cash flows. Instead, it is better to look at the consistency over a full business cycle of the company’s cash flow margins. Since 2002 (the beginning of the most recent business cycle), XRX has earned an average free cash flow margin of 9.7%, which has translated to 14.5 billion of free cash flow over the period (or $1.6 billion per year). Separately, ACS generated an average of $450 million in free cash flow over the five years prior to its acquisition. So, on a combined basis, before any synergies, the companies generated around $2 billion in free cash flow, which is quite a bit less than the 2010 figure.Unfortunately, this is not the entire story. Not included in this chart are the significant number of acquisitions that have been made over the period. In the last five years alone, the company has paid another $3.9 billion in cash for acquisitions (though, remember the ACS transaction was largely stock and partially the assumption of debt; the sticker price of XRX’s transactions is significantly higher than this cash figure). Given the relative stability in the company’s top line and free cash flows over the period, one might draw the conclusion that these acquisitions are integral to the company’s ability to sustain its market share and operating performance, and thus actual free cash flow available to common shareholders is significantly less.Xerox Corporation - Capital Structure, 1995 - 2010Here we see the company’s unattractive use of debt. This is the result of the company’s business model, as touched upon above. According to the company,Though I am certainly not a fan of this debt load, I am somewhat less concerned in this case than I am for most companies. As noted by the company, the bulk of this debt is due to the financing portion of the bundled lease agreements, and is therefore “matched” to a specific and consistent revenue stream. Since the company is not reliant on any one customer, it is also likely that this debt is matched to a large number of customers, and so it is unlikely that there would be a “surprise” bankruptcy that would suddenly leave the company without a revenue stream to pay down a large amount of its debt.So where does this leave us? Let’s start with asset value. On an asset basis, the company is not cheap. Despite trading below book value, the company has intangibles on its balance sheet that nearly equal its book value. The bulk of these intangibles are the result of the ACS acquisition, which appears to have been accomplished at a significant premium. I see little on the asset side to justify even the current share price, let alone one significantly higher so as to create a margin of safety. On an asset basis, I’ll pass.Turning now to cash flow. As noted, XRX and ACS have earned an average of about $2 billion of free cash flow (separately, and before synergies) on a normalized basis. The company’s enterprise value is currently about $20 billion, so this represents a free cash flow yield of just 10%. This really doesn’t excite me and my subsequent valuation shows no margin of safety at the current price. Combined with the significant debt load, lackluster returns, and the fact that management appears to have grossly overpaid for ACS (and significantly diluted shareholders in the process), I will pass on XRX. Especially when there are better opportunities in this space.What do you think of Xerox Corporation? Disclosure: No position."
317652,24866,2012-01-05T12:58:17-05:00,,"Since I first published my bearish article on Eastman Kodak (EK) nearly three months ago, the stock has lost more than two-thirds of its value. I highlighted how the company faces significant free cash flow burn and that much of the patents are worthless compared to those of other competitors, like Canon (NYSE:CAJ) and Panasonic (PC). Recent reports that the iconic supercentenarian is nearing bankruptcy filing appears to have confirmed my apprehensions. As one door closes, however, another opens. The latter scenario can be found in Xerox (NYSE:XRX).From a multiples perspective, Xerox is fairly cheap. It trades at a respective 11x and 6.9x past and forward earnings. My main concern with the company is how it lacks safety due to its low dividend yield of 2.1% and high beta of 1.6. Furthermore, net debt stands at a substantial $8.4 billion, which represents nearly three-quarters of market value. At a time when the market is concerned about poor end market demand in technology, Xerox's valuation has become overly depressed. In my view, a takeover is looming. While Kodak similarly has the high degree of risk, it lacks the upside. Its net debt stands at $670B, a substantial 5.3x market value. A buyout is thus not viable and existence in any form is questionable. To continue operations, Kodak would have to sell off core assets and further increase leverage, a vicious cycle that will further add risks. The best option forward is to file for bankruptcy so that the patent sale process can be eased.At the third quarter earnings call, Kodak's Chairman & CEO, Antonio Perez, spoke about his plan for the future:At this point, it is safe to say that investors now have a ""high degree"" of uncertainty about the IP monetization. Laura Quatela, who previously headed the firm's patent explorations, was tapped as President. The problem with the patents, however, is that they are being used as collateral for billion-dollar liabilities. If the company were to go into Chapter 11, pension obligations - worth annually in the hundred of millions - would be largely dismissed.The company is going to be delisted from the NYSE in the next six months if it fails to get its stock price up. With current operations a mess, more debt instead of cash, and patent sales not materializing as planned, the future looks bleak. During the September quarter, sales of $1.46B were well below the consensus estimate of $1.65B. Notably, sales in the Consumer Digital Imaging group declined 39% y-o-y due to a drop in IP transactions. Photofinishing and Entertainment fell by 10% y-o-y. Analysts currently rate the stock a ""sell"".I would not recommend a short play at this point, since management has started to take the right steps. The company recently sold Eastman Gelatine, a non-core asset, to Rousselot. The sensor business was sold to Platinum Equity and the company will benefit from auctioning off digital imaging patents. Consensus estimates for EPS are that it will decline to -$2.48 in 2011 and then turn positive at $0.20 in 2013.Xerox, on the other hand, is significantly more attractive from a takeover perspective. The firm, while largely associated with Kodak, has become a specialist in the more sustainable field of IT services. Dell (DELL-OLD) and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) have both made staggering multi-billion deals for similar companies, which suggests that Xerox could be substantially accretive to a larger firm.Specifically, I believe that IBM (NYSE:IBM) would benefit most from acquiring Xerox, since the former has substantial international exposure and manageable leverage. Furthermore, I find that IBM is significantly undervalued and has the opportunity to showcase the strength of its fundamentals through demonstrating synergistic value. While I believe that HP is also undervalued and could break $40, Meg Whitman has expressed disinterest in acquisitions greater than $1B and is focused on streamlining. HP trades at a respective 8.1x and 6x past and forward earnings, while IBM trades at a respective 14.7x and 12.5x past and forward earnings. Dell trades at a respective 7.8x and 7.5x past and forward earnings and the acquisition of Perot Systems has decreased the marginal value of a Xerox buyout.Consensus estimates for Xerox's EPS are that it will grow by 14.9% to $1.08 and then by 8.3% and 16.2% more in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 11x and a conservative 2012 EPS of $1.13, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $12.43, implying 52.5% upside. Even if the multiple were to plummet to 8x and 2012 EPS turns out to be 14.5% below the consensus, the stock would barely fall. Accordingly, analysts rate the stock overall a ""buy"".Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
322018,20898,2012-01-25T13:13:31-05:00,,"Xerox (NYSE:XRX) reported earnings today and Wall Street was not happy, sending shares down as much as 10%.The company reported a revenue miss and lower operating margins due to a mix of European slowdown in its technology segment and contract ramp-ups on the service side. But it was probably 2012 guidance that spooked investors as management lowered expectations across the board.Unlike Wall Street, I do not pay much heed to quarterly earnings and fluctuations. Companies have to adjust to changing conditions, whether it be the economic environment or increased competition, and at times, financial results will adversely affect this. Long-term investors can profit from Wall Street's unhealthy obsession with short-term earnings.Readers will recall that I wrote a bullish XRX article back in Sept 2011, where I laid out my investment thesis based mainly on two themes: 1) Xerox is transforming itself into a service company and 2) its copious free cash flow, which averaged $1.5B over the previous 5 years, was massively undervalued. At the time, management guided 2012 FCF at $2.0B - $2.3B. The company has now significantly lowered projected 2012 FCF to $1.5B - $1.8B, a ~25% decrease.While this is not a welcome development, my bull case for XRX built in a significant margin of safety in terms of operating results. I valued the stock at $12 - $14 based on FCF of $1.5B - $1.8B, which matches exactly 2012 guidance. While things could slip even further, we are still a ways from my bad-case scenario of $1B FCF in perpetuity. Even then, I would value shares around its current trading price. If I am right, it is a case of heads, I win and tails, I don't lose much -- a perfect scenario for long-term value investors.As such, I believe today's drop presents another opportunity. Back in September, I wrote in-the-money naked put options for a 12% premium. Those options expired worthless last week, allowing me to pocket the entire premium just before this earnings slip by the company. Today, I opened another naked put position, this time out-of-the-money Jan 2013 $7.5 puts for a 13% premium. While this trade is not as attractive (the premium is slightly higher but the contract duration is 12 months vs 4 months for a much lower annualized return), it still allows me to pocket a significant premium and set my price to own XRX. If I am assigned the shares next year, my cost basis will be ~$6.50, 17% below trading's trading price. Of course, conditions at the company could deteriorate significantly in that time to justify such a drop but nothing in today's earnings report suggests this is the case.Disclosure: I am short XRX naked put options."
315523,24866,2011-12-22T08:47:38-05:00,,"In an earlier article here, I argued that Xerox (NYSE:XRX) is an ideal takeover target for major tech companies. According to IDC analyst Alexander Motsenigos: ""[t]he big band acquisitions seem to be happening right now."" To expand into the domain of IT services, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ) recently purchased EDS for $13.9B while DELL-OLD purchased Perot Systems for $3.9B. I find that while Xerox would be accretive to both companies in the long term, short term pressures would make successful integration, admittedly, a bit of a juggling act.More likely, Xerox will be bought out for IBM - the largest of the three. Its strong fundamentals, international exposure, and large customer reach would yield meaningful revenue and cost synergies from an acquisition. The company has net debt of $18.8B, which represents 8.8% of market value and is manageable. Another possible suitor is Dell with its $5.6B worth of net cash. The company's fundamentals have floundered of late and an undervalued addition to Perot Systems could catalyze value. HP, on the other hand, has net debt of $22.6B, which represents 44.6% of market value. Hewlett-Packard's new CEO, Meg Whitman, is focused on simplifying the business, cutting costs, cleaning the balance sheet, and has explicitly stated reservations about acquisitions. Analysts are further noting that management is aiming for M&A activity no greater than $1B in 2012. That means Xerox, worth $19.5B by enterprise value, would not be on the table.Xerox remains, in my view, one of the more attractive investments in technology. At the third-quarter earnings call, Xerox's CEO, Ursula Burns, noted favorable developments:2012 is gearing up to be an inflection point for the company, as investors are looking to see tangible results from the ACS buyout. 2011 suffered from a poor business mix and declining IT has yielded lower demand for printing. Compared with expectations, however, Xerox performed well during the last two quarters. Moreover, investors are irrationally fearing the comany's exposure to Europe, which will result in abnormal high risk-adjusted returns. Europe represents one fifth of Xerox's business - much lower than peers. Management also remains committed to returning free cash flow to shareholders with the highest dividend yield of the 4 tech companies discussed in this article. In addition, 70% of surplus cash in 2012 will be applied to share repurchases (about $1.2B).Consensus estimates for Xerox's EPS are that it will grow by 14.9% to $1.08 in 2011 and then by 8.3% and 16.2% more in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 11x and a conservative 2012 EPS of $1.13, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $12.43, implying 54.2% upside. Accordingly, in my view, Xerox is a clear value play.Consensus estimates for Hewlett-Packard's EPS are that it will decline by 16.4% to $4.08 in 2012 and then turnaround to grow by 9.6% and 8.9% in the following two years. Assuming a multiple of 10x and a conservative 2013 EPS of $4.34, the company has significant upside. Even still, the Street rates shares around a ""hold"" and 34 of the 35 revisions to estimates have been lowered for a net change of 11.2%.Consensus estimates for Dell's EPS are that it will grow by 32.7% to $2.11 in 2011, decline by 4.3% in 2012, and then hold flat in 2013. Assuming a multiple of 9x and a conservative 2012 EPS of $1.95, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $17.55, implying 19.4% upside.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in XRX over the next 72 hours."
310406,24764,2011-11-28T03:52:23-05:00,,"Xerox (NYSE:XRX) has long been associated with printing.  Xerox has since changed its direction by focusing more on technology and services. A year ago, revenue from technology and services was almost equal. Now, Services represents a higher percentage of total revenue. This reflects investments in building out the company's outsourcing portfolio as well as expanding the company's offerings internationally.  Revenue from Document Outsourcing was up 12% in the most recent quarter and BPO revenue was up 6%. BPO signings came in at $2.3 billion, which is up over 10% year-over-year. Joint sales activities between Xerox and ACS have resulted in more than 200 deals this year. Many of these deals are also multi-year agreements which help build Xerox's revenue stream.  One segment of particular interest is the performance from the services business.I believe Xerox is in the middle of converting its business into a technology and consulting company. This move reminds me of IBM when it went through the process of liquidating its hardware business in order to focus more on consulting services. Xerox has done a great job in diversifying its business as printing started to suffer. Here are some examples of services that Xerox provides to customers.  Xerox is actually the largest provider of transportation services to governments in the world. The company has projects in about 30 countries. Xerox has digital solutions for tolling, parking and public transit; these systems have been deployed in over 400 municipalities around the world.  Xerox also has a strong presence in claims processing. A good example is  the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs; Xerox created the infrastructure and is currently managing the process to convert a paper-based claims system into a digital one. The new system for the VA will significantly reduce backlogs and more accurately process benefit claims for veterans and their dependents. Xerox should continue to benefit in this market as health care companies transition into an electronic format to comply with new health regulations. I'm bullish on Xerox, and view pullbacks as opportunities to buy. Xerox is currently being dragged down by the market, so the $6 area should be a good spot to start a position. Even though a full transition may take time, I believe that long term shareholders should benefit from the company's turnaround. I like the direction the company is heading by focusing on the margin rich service business. Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in XRX over the next 72 hours."
312688,24276,2011-12-08T12:27:22-05:00,,"Takeover Analyst is quietly beating the drum for a takeover of Xerox (NYSE:XRX). Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) seems his favored destination.Under Ursula Burns, Xerox has stopped the rot at the heart of the company, for whom copying was a niche circling the drain. She did it by buying ACS, a computer services company with a strong niche in healthcare. This has given XRX a steady PE of 11, which is better than HPQ or DELL (DELL-OLD).But it's not terribly exciting.There was a lot of interest in healthcare IT two years ago, with the launch of the $19 billion HITECH plan as part of the stimulus bill. The idea was that hospitals and clinics would be lining up to buy new computer hardware, software and services with that sweet, sweet stimulus cash, facing a hard deadline of late 2014 before they might be penalized for failure to move.Things haven't worked out that way. Most of the money has gone to established healthcare vendors tied to hospital managements, or to SaaS “cloud” systems like athenaHealth (NASDAQ:ATHN) , whose links to getting paid give it an edge. This is why Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently threw in its healthcare hand to GE (NYSE:GE).ACS has good contacts with healthcare managements but it may not have enough technological “oomph” behind it to get it where Burns wants it to go. Giving those customers a long-term strategy means building out cloud assets, and the question becomes whether XRX has the cash to do that, or whether a take-out then makes sense.The business idea behind a buy-out would be that ACS' niche play goes under HPQ's EDS unit or Dell's Perot Systems. Both companies are rapidly building out their own clouds, into which healthcare could then grow. Takeover Analyst probably finds HPQ a better fit because its $56 billion market cap would make XRX a smaller meal, against Dell's $28 billion.But there's another way this could go, with Xerox being a buyer rather than a seller.Computer Sciences (CSC) has a government niche that looks as solid as ACS' in healthcare. The company's shares have crashed this year over concern that government spending will be cut. But CSC has been investing heavily in cloud technology, anticipating the government's own moves in that direction.A Xerox purchase of CSC would give its health services customers a cloud strategy, while giving CSC a private industry strategy. Hospitals might find themselves more comfortable inside a company that serves government – thus has security – than working with a mainline company like Dell or HP.It might also double-down on its own niche and make a play for athenaHealth, a high-flyer in the space it could afford to buy.But if this kind of play were made, it would put a downdraft on XRX shares. It would not be accretive, but a longer-term strategic play. In other words, bearish for investors in the near-to-medium term.Still, it's as likely Burns will move in that direction, toward being a bigger fish, than allow Xerox to be swallowed up.Disclosure: I am long GE.Additional disclosure: I have about 200 shares of GE in my retirement account."
308456,24866,2011-11-16T15:43:49-05:00,,"Over the years, Xerox (NYSE:XRX) has built a strong brand name and become synonymous with printing solutions. The firm expanded by acquisitions into a variety of other segments and now offers technology, services, software, and IT outsourcing support, in addition to its flagship unit. The problem is that for the last three decades, shareholder value has gone nowhere. In the last twelve months, the stock is down 27.9%, and net debt now stands at 73.9% of market value. Where to go from here?The stock trades at a respective PE and forward PE ratio of 11.1 and 7 - an extreme discount to peers - and is in the position to be a takeover target. In the foreseeable future, the firm will struggle more from macro headwinds than its competitors will. When there is a decline in IT, poor demand in business printing follows - and hence Xerox has a major issue at hand.The best step forward for shareholders may very well be a takeover by a competitor that is exposed to higher-margin segments and can unlock revenue synergies. Although Xerox's acquisition of Affiliated Computer Services (ACS) was hailed as a step towards greater profitability, it has yet to materialize meaningful synergies. Management has indicated that operating margins will increase into 2012, but softer than anticipated gross margins should give pause. As the firm shifts over to ACS-services, this will become more of an issue, especially given increasing competition.At the recent third quarter earnings call, CEO Ursula Burns spent a good amount of time discussing ""transform[ative]"" strategy:An acquisition can accomplish all three priorities in one fell swoop. Possible suitors include DELL (DELL-OLD), which has $7.4B worth of net cash, IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ). Many rumors for why a buyout would occur have been speculated, but the important aspect to stress is that these companies can provide a tremendous global footprint and cross-selling opportunities for Xerox. Xerox remains attractive to them as a value and synergistic play. As I highlighted earlier, Dell is suffering from stagnating growth and has too little expenditures on R&D; an acquisition could compensate for years of inaction. Should a tender offer ever present itself, Xerox would likely view it as a stop-gap measure - but nevertheless a measure - to decelerating volumes. With value levers limited at the present moment and the path forward unclear, a buyout would inject vitality in a struggling business.Even without a takeover, I still believe that Xerox represents an attractive value play. Consensus estimates for EPS are that it will increase by 14.9% to $1.08 and then by 8.3% and 16.2% more in the following years. Of the 10 revisions, 8 have gone up. Assuming a multiple of 11 - below the peer median level - and a conservative 2012 EPS estimate of $1.13, the rough intrinsic value of the stock is $12.43. That represents more than a 50% margin of safety and more than justifies the high volatility of the stock, as represented by its beta of 1.6. Given the potential of a takeover, the upside is huge, thus providing for favorable risk asymmetry.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Its products range from printers to copiers to scanners. It also offers the software and follow up services that businesses need to run their administrative processes. In a world where offices and processes are considered to be paperless, its amazing how much paper is used and stored. Xerox supplies paper, too.Xerox shares are currently trading around $7.50, and the mean 12 month price target from analysts researching the stock is $11.44 (52% upside potential). This stock is trading around its 50 day exponential moving average of $7.81 and lower than its 200 day exponential moving average of $10.52. The stock has weakened since the market turned south in July and August, creating a series of lower lows and lower highs (see chart). This seems to have recently broken, and I expect the shares to move upward and through the 50 day and 200 day EMA. The 52 week price range is $6.55 to $12.08. Earnings per share for the last 12 months are $0.70, and these are expected to increase to $1.22 in its next fiscal year (ending December 2012). These numbers place the shares on a trailing price to earnings ratio of 10.95, and a forward multiple of 6.24.For investors looking at dividend paying stocks, Xerox’s payment of a dividend of $0.17 last year gives the stock a yield of 2.20%, and is covered more than four times by its earnings.In an industry sector considered to be unexciting, competitors like Canon Inc (NYSE:CAJ) pays a higher dividend yield (3.20%). Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) pays a dividend which equates to a yield of 1.90%. Ricoh Co Ltd. (OTCPK:RICOY) paid a far higher dividend yield of 4.10% last year, though this is not covered by its earnings and unlikely to be so in the future.Current operating margin at Xerox is 8.26%, with a return on assets of 3.80% and a return on equity of 8.35%. The current revenue from its income statement is $2.48 billion, and last quarter’s revenue showed year on year growth of 1.90%. Xerox has cash of $1.10 billion, and a total of $9.31 billion in debt. The company’s debt/equity ratio is 69.01. In comparison, Canon has almost no debt, and a debt/equity ratio of just 0.64, while Hewlett Packard’s debt/equity ratio position is similar to Xerox’s, at 65.69.Click to enlarge:Returning to the chart, Xerox shares have performed very poorly in the second half of this year to date. Canon shares did not take the massive hit that Xerox shares did through July/ August, as Xerox second quarter results came in 10% weaker than expected: $0.22 per share versus market expectations of $0.24 per share. Since then, the shares have been unloved and underperforming. However, with the shares having bounced from their 12–month low, a more positive chart pattern forming, and with a yield now over 2%, I expect the shares to rise further.A look at recent news cements this view:Overall, given the share price history, fundamentals, and news from Xerox, I consider the shares to be extremely good value at the current level.

303531,24063,2011-10-30T10:15:28-04:00,,"The Xerox Corporation (NYSE:XRX) develops, manufactures, distributes, sells, services and finances document equipment. XRX recently announced its third quarter earnings. The news was good – a 28% increase in profit, a 33% increase in contract signings and both earnings per share and total revenue exceeded analyst expectations. Finance chief Luca Maestri explained that Xerox’s strong services offering is helping it weather the ""weak, relatively soft and volatile economic environment, and the financial markets.""But strong earnings do not always mean a good buy. There are other factors to consider, like its cash conversion cycle. Otherwise, all you are looking at is a snapshot of the company, not a broader view of its potential to earn profits for investors – you aren’t getting a good view of the company’s worth or the stock’s actual value.While not everyone is a pro when it comes to company valuation, there are a few metrics anyone can use to get an approximation of a stock’s real value: the current price multiples, the consistency of past earnings and cash flow, the amount of growth expected. Let’s see what these numbers can tell us about XRX.First, we will look at the P/E ratio. This metric divides a company’s share price by its earnings per share – the lower the number, the better. P/E ratio indicates how many times its earnings a company is trading at. If the P/E ratio is high, the stock could be overpriced.Next, we will take a look at the company’s enterprise value to unlevered free cash flow. To get this metric, we will divide the company’s enterprise value (market cap plus debt minus cash) by its unlevered free cash flow (just free cash flow with interest payments added back in). The lower this number, the better. Like with the P/E ratio, if this number is too high it means the stock is likely overpriced.There are two different camps of thought on this subject, each thinks the other multiple is more important, but they agree on one common aspect. The lower these multiples are the better. XRX has a P/E ratio of 11.08 and a EV/FCF of 12.60.To get some perspective on XRX’s numbers, let’s look at its closest competitors –International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Canon (NYSE:CAJ) and Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ). CAJ has a higher P/E ratio at 19.96 but a much lower EV/FCF at 9.57. IBM has a 14.85 P/E ratio of and an EV/FCF of 15.17, indicating the stock is priced relative to its earnings. HPQ has the lowest P/E ratio at 6.57 and an EV/FCF of 6.38.An ideal investment has strong consistency in its earnings. It would have a small range for its free cash flow yield. XRX’s cash flow yield over the last five years ranges from 9.07% to 28.96%, for an average of 14.87%. IBM has a much narrower yield, producing numbers in the range of 7.15% to 13.26% over the last five years, averaging 9.11%. CAJ’s free cash flow yield ranged from 2.76% to 13.04% over the last five years, for an average of 6.52%. HPQ averaged a free cash flow yield of 9.74% over the last five years, ranging from 5.36% to 17.32% in that period. XRX had the greatest increase but IBM was the most consistent.Now that we know where these stocks have been, let’s take a look at their expected growth.Expected growth estimates can be wrong. In fact, they are frequently overstated, but they can be useful when comparing companies or comparing a company’s performance relative to its industry. For instance, in the case of XRX it actually lost -2.4% of earnings annually in the last 5 years, underperforming the industry by 2%, but analysts expect the stock to increase by 18.1% over the next five years, beating industry estimates of 10.8%. In contrast, IBM grew by 16% over the last five years but is only expected to grow by 10.7% over the next five years. CAJ lost -0.7% in the last five years and it is expected to grow 6.7% over the next five. HPQ grew 20.6% over the last five years but analysts expect the stock to increase by 8% in the next five.We’ve looked at XRX’s and its closest competitors’ price multiples, operational performance and growth. XRX is not a bad pick, but we like CAJ best. It is a strong buy. Its PE ratio is a little high but its number are very consistent, suggesting the stock is less volatile than its competitors. CAJ is a good stock for a long position. Investments in CAJ should grow consistently at a modest rate. Other stocks similarly positioned include Kraft Foods (KFT), which grew by 1.5% over the last five years and is expected to grow by 8% over the next five, or Dominos Pizza (NYSE:DPZ). DPZ lost 1.2% over the last five years but is expected to grow 10.7% over the next five.Jim Simons’ Renaissance Technologies seems to agree. It has more than $31.5 million invested in CAJ, and also owns a position in DPZ. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is also bullish on XRX.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Adjusted earnings  also exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 25 cents per share.Revenues increased marginally by 3% year over year to $5.58 billion,  nearly meeting the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.59 billion. Revenues  from sales increased 2%, while the same from service, outsourcing and  rentals increased 3%. However, finance income dropped 3% during the  reported quarter.Gross margin in the quarter declined slightly to 32.7% from 33.6% in  the prior-year quarter, whereas operating margin rose to 9.6% from the  year-ago level of 9.2%.Segment PerformanceRevenues from the Technology segment remained almost  flat at $2.50 billion, as equipment sales inched up 1% year over year  due to a decline in entry installs that more than offset the positive  performance in mid-range and high-end color installs. The segment’s  profit increased $11 million to $258 million in the quarter.The improvement in profit was attributed to decrease in costs and  expenses, resulting from restructuring savings and lower bad debt  expenses combined with an increase in equity in net income from  unconsolidated affiliates.Services segment revenue increased 6.4% to $2.72  billion from $2.55 billion reported in the year-ago quarter. The  increase was driven by improvement in business process outsourcing (BPO)  and document outsourcing (DO) services, partially offset by flat  information technology outsourcing (ITO) performance.Revenues from DO increased 12% while the same from the BPO business  improved 6%. The segment’s profit went up to $323 million from $286  million in the prior year due to increased productivity.Revenues from the Other segment declined 10.3% to $366  million from $408 million a year ago. At the same time, the segment’s  loss widened to $86 million from the year-ago loss of $79 million.Financial PositionXerox had cash and cash equivalents of $785 billion as of September 30,  2011, compared with $1.21 billion as of December 31, 2010. Total debt  amounted to $9.20 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2011 versus  $8.61 billion at the end of the fourth quarter of 2010. The company  repurchased approximately $309 million of shares in the quarter, thereby  resuming its share buyback plans.In the first nine months of the year, net cash generated from operating  activities dropped drastically to $683 million from $1.42 billion a  year ago. The deterioration in cash flow was due to lower benefit from  account receivable sales, higher net tax payments, high inventory levels  and increased contributions to pension benefit plans. GuidanceXerox anticipates GAAP and adjusted EPS of 28 cents–31 cents per share  and 32 cents–35 cents per share, respectively, for the fourth quarter of  2011. For full-year 2011, the company expects GAAP earnings between 92  cents and 95 cents per share and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.08 per  share to $1.11 per share. In addition, Xerox expects to repurchase  shares worth $400 million in the upcoming quarter.Our TakeXerox is a highly recognized brand globally with an estimated brand  value of $6.43 billion. The company is highly focused on expanding its  business globally based on its well-knitted distribution network. The  company has also identified huge opportunities in the domestic markets  as well as in the emerging markets.In order to seize the opportunities in the emerging markets, Xerox  partnered with Trigon last year to offer its authorized products for the  first time in the UAE. The company also appointed Seven Seas, a  UAE-based systems integrator and reseller, as its channel partner with  an objective to expand its indirect channel business and boost market  share.The company has also taken similar initiatives in the domestic market  as well. The recent acquisitions by GIS testify the fact. Apart from  Premier Office Equipment, GIS also acquired Illinois-based United  Business Solutions and Pensacola-based Florida Imaging & Network  Systems with the same objective.With all these agreements, contracts and acquisitions, Xerox aims to  capitalize on the growing market to strengthen its financial performance  in the upcoming quarters.However, growing competition, advancement in IT, reduced demand for  papers and other document equipments may act as potential headwinds for  the company going forward. The company’s key competitors include Canon Inc. (NYSE:CAJ) and Pitney Bowes Inc. (NYSE:PBI).Thus, the shares of Xerox Corp. are maintaining a Zacks #3 Rank, which  translates to a Hold rating over the short term (1 to 3 months) and we  reiterate our recommendation of Neutral over the long term (more than 6  months)."
296624,24491,2011-09-29T08:43:40-04:00,,"As part of our process, we perform a rigorous discounted cash-flow methodology that dives into the true intrinsic worth of companies. In Xerox's (NYSE:XRX) case, we think the company is worth $14 per share, offering significant upside from today's levels. We think a discounted cash-flow process is best to capture the long-term value creation of companies, and Xerox's operating results speak to significant economic outperformance and high returns on capital.Further, we think a comprehensive analysis of a company's discounted cash-flow valuation, relative valuation versus industry peers, as well as an assessment of technical and momentum indicators is the best way to identify the most attractive stocks at the best time to buy. This process culminates in what we call our Valuentum Buying Index, which ranks stocks on a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the best.If a company is undervalued both on a DCF and on a relative valuation basis and is showing improvement in technical and momentum indicators, it scores high on our scale. We think our methodology and broad coverage universe is largely responsible for the meaningful outperformance of the portfolio in our Best Ideas Newsletter. Xerox scores a 6 on our Valuentum Buying Index, which is an above average rating, and reflects our constructive view on the shares.Our Report on Xerox(click to enlarge images)　Investment ConsiderationsFor every company in our coverage universe, we rate them on 13 unique measures. To get started, we show Xerox's below:Investment HighlightsXerox earns a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT, the highest possible mark on our scale. The company has been generating economic value for shareholders for the past few years, a track record we view very positively. We expect the return on invested capital (excluding goodwill) to expand to 22.3% from 16.8% during the next two years.Xerox 's valuation is compelling at this time. The company is trading at a nice discount to our estimate of its fair value, even after considering an appropriate margin of safety. The company's forward earnings multiple and PEG ratio also look attractive versus peers.The company's shares have underperformed the market benchmark during the past quarter. Although Xerox's valuation appears attractive, the company is currently exhibiting characteristics of a potential value trap, and we'd still be cautious at these levels. There may be a better entry point yet.Though it remains out of favor with the market, the company continues to put up excellent quarterly performance. In its second quarter (pdf), adjusted earnings rose 13% on modest revenue expansion. Xerox also upped its full year guidance at the time of its mid-year report.The company sports a very nice dividend yield of 2.3%. We expect it to pay out about 15%-20% of next year's earnings to shareholders as dividends.
Economic Profit Analysis
The best measure of a company's ability to create value for shareholders is expressed by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) with its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The gap or difference between ROIC and WACC is called the economic profit spread. Xerox 's 3-year historical return on invested capital (without goodwill) is 14.6%, which is above the estimate of its cost of capital of 7.9%. As such, we assign it a ValueCreation™ rating of EXCELLENT. In the chart below, we show the probable path of ROIC in the years ahead based on the estimated volatility of key drivers behind the measure. The solid grey line reflects the most likely outcome, in our opinion, and represents the scenario that results in our fair value estimate.
　
Cash Flow AnalysisValuation Analysis
We think Xerox is worth $14 per share, which represents a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 31.2 times last year's earnings and an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of about 11.8 times last year's EBITDA. Our model reflects a compound annual revenue growth rate of 3.4% during the next five years, a pace that is lower than the company's 3-year historical compound annual growth rate of 9.7%. Our model reflects a 5-year projected average operating margin of 9.7%, which is above Xerox 's trailing 3-year average. Beyond year 5, our valuation model assumes free cash flow will grow at an annual rate of 3.1% for the next 15 years and 3% in perpetuity. We employ a 7.9% weighted average cost of capital to discount future free cash flows.



Margin of Safety Analysis
Our discounted cash flow process values each company on the basis of the present value of all future free cash flows. Although we estimate the company's fair value at about $14 per share, every company has a range of probable fair values that's created by the uncertainty of key valuation drivers (like future revenue or earnings, for example). After all, if the future was known with certainty, we wouldn't see much volatility in the markets as stocks would trade precisely at their known fair values. Our ValueRisk™ rating sets the margin of safety or the fair value range we assign to each stock.
In the graph below, we show this probable range of fair values for Xerox. We think the company is attractive below $10 per share (the green line), but quite expensive above $18 per share (the red line). The prices that fall along the yellow line, which includes our fair value estimate, represent a reasonable valuation for the company, in our opinion.


Future Path of Fair Value
We estimate Xerox's fair value at this point to be about $14 per share. As time passes, however, companies generate cash flow and pay out cash to shareholders in the form of dividends. The chart below compares the company's current share price with the path of Xerox 's expected equity value per share over the next three years, assuming our long-term projections prove accurate. The range between the resulting downside fair value and upside fair value in Year 3 represents our best estimate of the value of the company's shares three years hence.
This range of potential outcomes is also subject to change over time, should our views on the company's future cash flow potential change. The expected fair value of $18 per share in Year 3 represents our existing fair value per share of $14 increased at an annual rate of the company's cost of equity less its dividend yield. The upside and downside ranges are derived in the same way, but from the upper and lower bounds of our fair value estimate range.

295726,24191,2011-09-25T04:26:26-04:00,,"Xerox (XRX) was founded in 1906 as the Haloid Company; it was named Haloid Xerox in 1958 and Xerox Corporation in 1961. 2010 revenue was $22 billion, with 136,000 employees and a geographical scope extending to 160 countries.Xerox’s financial performance is based on the following two primary reportable segments – Technology and Services. The Technology segment includes the sale of document systems and supplies, technical services and product financing. The products range from: The Services segment is comprised of three outsourcing service offerings:Service revenues more than doubled due to acquisitions in 2010 as shown below.Before we get to the valuation, we’ll take a look at a few metrics. The first graph is a history of revenue vs. gross margin: Revenue growth looks good but gross margins have been falling. Drilling down deeper reveals that in January 2011 management announced the business would operate in a gross margin range of 33% to 35% going forward. One reason is the change in product mix. As noted above, the Services segment has more than doubled through acquisitions, accounting for the jump in revenues and lower gross margins. Why? Projected 2012 gross margins for this segment are 23-25% while the technology clocks in at 44-46%. On a brighter note, the operating margins for Services are 11-13%, slightly higher than the Technology segment at 9-11%. 2012 revenue growth for the Services segment is projected to be substantially higher (6-8%) than the Technology segment (1-3%). Xerox is moving from a technology to a services oriented company. The drop in margins has more to do with the product mix vs. pricing pressure.To provide more color going forward, management has provided the following guidance summarized below (source: Q2 Investor Handout): Management expects to generate over $10B of free cash flow over the next 5 years.VALUATIONHere is one fair value view based on management’s financial track record focusing on the financials as they relate to fair value, followed by possible risks.Fair values are based, in part, on the following: discounted cash flow, a modified Graham's intrinsic value formula and a P/E analysis. The valuation model consists of two parts.Fair value used is the minimum value of the two parts.Part 1: Discounted cash flow and the modified Graham’s intrinsic value. Longer term earnings growth estimate:Projections (for EPS and cash) are arrived at by calculating the statistics for a trend line using the ""least squares"" method. This determines the line that best fits the historical data. Projected earnings growth through 2016 averages about 2.6% based on a combination of the 10 and 5 year trends.Analysts are much more optimistic for longer term earnings growth than our analysis, projecting 18% despite the graph depicting lower growth through 2014. (Source: nasdaq.com) We should note the below graph is as of September 23, 2011. A reason for the optimism could be the 2010 acquisitions. Analyst consensus earnings growth projections:The numbers we use are based on diluted GAAP earnings, not adjusted earnings. Management expects adjusted earnings in the range of 10%+ which takes into account share buybacks.Longer term cash flow growth:  Projected long term cash flow growth calculations are 4%. This represents a weighting of the 3, 5, and 10 year trends using 2011 as the baseline. Our five year FCF totals approach managements $10B projection.Estimated long-term EPS and cash flow growth rates going forward are 2.6% and 4%, respectively. Running these projections through our pricing model produces a fair value of $10. Needless to say, the result is sensitive to changes in these growth rates, as illustrated below.   XRX     EPS & Cash Growth rates FV   EPS-4.57%; Cash-6.00% $12.00   EPS-3.57%; Cash-5.00% $11.00   EPS-2.57%; Cash-4.00% $10.00   EPS-1.57%; Cash-3.00% $9.60   EPS-0.57%; Cash-2.00% $8.90   EPS-(0.43%); Cash-1.00% $7.40   Part 2: P/E Analysis  The pricing model produces a PE of 15.25 yielding a fair value of $13.4.Final fair value is the minimum of the two methods or $10. The stock is trading at a 29% discount at the time of this writing. S&P has a 12 month target price of $14, Goldman Sachs-$11, Credit Suisse-$12, and the consensus median price on Yahoo Finance is $11.Xerox pays a dividend of $0.17 yielding 2.39% based on a price of $7.11. The dividend represents a payout ratio to trailing twelve month free cash flow of approximately 17%.RiskThe largest risk at this point is macroeconomic events that would negatively affect not only Xerox, but all financial markets. Uncertainty about current global economic conditions poses a risk as consumers and businesses may continue to postpone spending in response to tighter credit, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values, which could have a material negative effect on demand for Xerox’s products and services. A significant portion of revenues are generated from operations outside the United States. Future revenues, costs and results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates - particularly the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar and Japanese yen to euro exchange rates, as well as by a number of other factors, including changes in a country’s political conditions, trade protection measures, licensing requirements, local tax issues, capitalization and other related legal matters.A summary of all financial details used in the analysis can be viewed here.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in XRX over the next 72 hours."
293800,24594,2011-09-15T05:36:55-04:00,,"This is the fourth in a five part series this week. (See here for the most recent installment.)Back in August I wrote an article here on Seeking Alpha recommending that investors stay aggressive in the midst of a market correction. This week, I'm highlighting 5 iconic brands that look undervalued. These companies have strong business models, valuable brands, long histories of profitability, and depressed share prices. While the broad market woes are not solely responsible for their declines, these five companies are all in a position to rebound strongly along with the broader economy.Today's spotlighted company is Xerox (NYSE:XRX). The company, of course, is famous for its photocopiers, with a brand so ubiquitous that it has become a verb: ""to Xerox"", or copy a document. The long-time tech titan still creates a significant amount of its revenue through the sales, service, and financing of its copiers. But the company is changing; its Technology segment was in fact outsold in the second quarter by its Services segment, which provides outsourced business processes and information technology solutions, along with document management.The stock has struggled for most of 2011, with a downward drift accelerated by the market correction beginning in late July (click to enlarge image):XRX 1-year chart, courtesy Yahoo! Finance  The long slide downward has created an appealing valuation for the stock. At Wednesday's close of $7.82, the stock trades for less than 8 times trailing earnings of $1.01 per share (please note: earnings are adjusted figures from the company, which may differ from figures given by other sources). The company is guiding for $2 billion in operating cash flow, along with $500 million in capital expenditures, putting levered cash flow (net of interest on debt) in the range of $1 billion (assuming interest costs of about $500 million, below recent averages as the company noted on its second quarter conference call.) The $1 billion in LCF estimated for 2011 is 9% of market capitalization, a solid figure. More impressive are the company's numbers before -- and its estimates after -- the current fiscal year:1 -- estimate based on guidance of $2 billion in operating cash flow, $500 million in capital expenditures, and interest cost below 2010 figure of $586 million 2 -- estimated based on midpoint of guidance for $2.6-$2.9 billion in operating cash flow, $500 million in capital expenditures, and interest cost below that of 2011   Much of the decrease in 2011 is due to a buildup in working capital, split between supply chain issues from the Japan earthquake, and increased upfront investments in the company's Services division, a buildup that the company expects to reverse in 2012. Worth noting is that the four-year sum of cash flow would be some $5.75 billion, over half of the company's current market capitalization. To its credit, Xerox management is returning some of the cash to shareholders. The company's current dividend yield sits at 2.17%, which rivals the return on the ten-year Treasury. The company has $700 million in stock buybacks planned for the remainder of 2011, with at least another $1 billion set for 2012. In short, over eighteen months, the company plans to repurchase some 15% of shares outstanding.Xerox's balance sheet is acceptable, if not pristine. Total debt is $9.3 billion as of June 30th, with a forecast of $8.6 billion after a $750MM repayment of senior notes later in the year. Add in the company's $1.1 billion in cash, and $3.8 billion in long-term liabilities (including pension and medical benefits owed), and total net liabilities should be about $11.3 billion at year's end, roughly equal to the company's market cap. Some $6.3 billion of the debt is related to the company's financing of copier purchases, according to the company, as Xerox must finance the equipment it leases out to corporate consumers.On the top-line, revenue growth has been weak. 2010 sales spiked thanks to the purchase of Affiliated Computer Systems, whose former assets now make the bulk of Xerox's Services division. But year-over-year sales in the second quarter rose just 2%, and were actually down 1% in constant currency terms. (The company does expect supply chain issues caused by the Japan quake to boost third quarter earnings against the same quarter of 2010.) The Services segment -- which grew nearly 6% y/y in the first half -- is providing all of the company's growth, as sales in the legacy copier business remain flat. Indeed, analysts expect only 3-4% annual growth for the company in 2011 and 2012.Going forward, the company must manage costs to create any earnings growth, given the challenges on the topline from the broader economy and the slow erosion of the copier and commercial printing businesses. Through several major restructuring programs, and continued cost-cutting resulting from the ACS acquisition, Xerox management would appear to have the chance to do so. A slide in the company's second quarter earnings presentation details some of the benefits (see page 15): $270 million in annual savings from the restructuring efforts (which included layoffs and the closing of business lines), and $120 million in added pre-tax profit, thanks to the ACS purchase. These tailwinds should continue going forward and help the company continue to increase margins, and thus earnings. Indeed, the company is guiding adjusted earnings to rise some 17% (at the midpoint of guidance for $1.07-$1.12) this year, despite the slow revenue growth, as fixed costs continue to drop.The question for potential XRX investors -- and one of the key drivers behind the stock's decline -- is how it will handle a major pullback in business spending. The company's use of leverage in its leasing business means a small spike in delinquencies or lease cancellations could have a major effect on cash flow. The company's exposure to government spending through both its Technology and Services divisions (the Services division manages unemployment and Medicaid programs at the state level, for instance) is also cause for concern. CEO Ursula Burns addressed those concerns on the Q2 conference call:It's also important to note that company stayed profitable through the 2008-2009 recession, on an earnings and cash flow basis. The addition of ACS in 2010 should add additional cushion in a double-dip recession.Xerox's strong cash flow and commitment to shareholders should trump the valid concerns about revenue growth. Xerox is a mature company that is unlikely to see double-digit top-line growth for many years, if ever again. Yet, on its sheer earnings power, it appears undervalued. Earnings and cash flow numbers are strong, its debt load is decreasing, and the company is trading well below its book value of $9.49/share.Its success in integrating ACS, and its continued expansion into the higher-growth, higher-margin services business, leaves Xerox poised to rebound sharply when business confidence and spending pick up. In the meantime, patient investors can collect over 2% annually, hope for a benefit from the company's stock repurchase program, and ride out the current economic storm.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
290737,23762,2011-08-30T17:43:18-04:00,,"Xerox (NYSE:XRX) has been a losing proposition for quite some time. However, I believe it has hit a bottom and that now is the time to start to build a position. I based this on two factors.First, Xerox appears to forming a technical base at just under $8 a share (see chart):   Second, the market is not giving Xerox its due from transforming itself from a cyclical manufacturer to a more stable service provider. Xerox’s service revenues have moved from 23% of revenues in 2009 to 44% currently, and should be at over 50% in the next 12 to 18 months. This transformation should drive earnings consistency and a higher multiple on the stock.“Xerox Corporation engages in the development, manufacture, marketing, service, and finance of document equipment, software, solutions, and services worldwide.

293754,20898,2011-09-14T23:34:23-04:00,,"Few brands penetrate the mainstream to such an extent that their names become verbs. A modern example would be Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), as in ""google it"", directing someone to do a web search. Once upon a time, Xerox's (NYSE:XRX) brand and technology was similarly prominent, Xerox-ing being a synonym for copying. Such fads in the vernacular can be fleeting for companies, however, and offers no assurance that eventual obsolescence can be avoided. Society continues to move closer to a paperless ideal, a trend that offers little growth for a company built on enterprise copiers and printers. The times, they are-a-changin', yes, but what investors may not understand is that Xerox has changed with them.Xerox still derives almost half of revenues from the Technology segment, their traditional business of providing copiers, printers and corresponding services/supplies to businesses. While growth in this segment has stalled, management still sees opportunities to shift clients to color pages, where price premium with black & white (B&W) has narrowed to make color more affordable. More importantly, Xerox's install base gives them a foothold to offer clients other services, an important aspect of their transformation which should allow the company to grow in the future.Xerox's Technology segment and its massive salesforce translate into a platform to offer other services like Document Management (DO). Businesses still generate a huge volume of paper and corporations can find it beneficial to outsource management of these documents. But Xerox's transformation truly crystallized with its $6.4B purchase of Affiliated Computer Services (ACS) in early 2010, which tripled its Services segment overnight. The timing was stellar as they announced the deal in September of 2009, paying only a 34% premium to ACS' beaten-down share price. Nearly two years on, the transaction looks a winner for Xerox as its Services segment now provides roughly half of revenues/profits and contains nearly all of its growth prospects.The ACS transaction provided Xerox instant access to the Business Processing (BPO) market and bolstered its IT outsourcing (ITO) and DO services. So Xerox now makes half its money providing mundane but critical services like collecting traffic tolls, processing healthcare claims, managing states' unemployment claims, providing customer service, handling companies' document generation and managing IT infrastructure, just to point out a few areas. Recent billion-dollar Medicaid contracts in California and Texas notwithstanding, the company's contracts are diversified enough that no single or handful of contracts comprise a significant portion of revenue.Moving into businesses like BPO, ITO and DO has strengthened Xerox's annuity revenue profile as over 90% of Services revenue is annuity. The Technology segment also brings in 65% of revenue as annuity, since most of its money is generated not on the equipment sales/lease but on services and supplies following installation. Combined, the company's realizes 84% of its revenue as annuity which provides great visibility on future results.The Services segment is also where management sees the best growth possibility, projecting 6-8% revenue growth in 2012 vs. 1-3% for the Technology segment. The company plans to deploy its large legacy salesforce to boost ACS' global presence. Given Services' stronger annuity base and higher operating margins, management has definitely set Xerox on the right track.Of course, reviewing Xerox's business position is only part of the process. More importantly, we must review its valuation at current share prices.    XRX generates outstanding free cash flow as evidenced by the 5 year + TTM chart below:  [$M] Taking an average of the last 5 years + TTM FCF gives us $1.5B annual FCF. The table indicates we can expect Xerox to reliably generate roughly 6% FCF return on assets with an anomaly in 2008, where a one-time expense related to litigation settlements hit results. TTM FCF of $1.4B has dropped from previous years' $2.0-$2.2B numbers as the company expends capital to build out its services platform but the decline should be temporary. Applying XRX 5-year + TTM avg rate of 6% FCF return on assets yields $1.8B annual FCF, which happens to match management's guidance for 2011 with 2012 FCF expected to move up to $2.0-$2.3B. The company expects to generate low-mid single-digit growth but for my analysis, I conservatively project zero growth in perpetuity. Here's how the various valuation scenarios play out:Free cash flow analysis suggests XRX is significantly undervalued. 2008 was the worst year for FCF but included the aforementioned litigation settlement. I put a bad-case scenario at $1B FCF, half of what management is guiding for 2011/2012, and still get a value near today's trading range. Keep in mind, that $1B FCF would be a baseline figure assuming 0% growth which means we're assuming XRX will only generate $1B annually in perpetuity. I consider this scenario highly unlikely, perhaps less than 5% probability. Less negative scenarios such as $1.4-$1.5B FCF provide XRX with a considerable 25-30% margin of safety. I value XRX at $12 - $14 per share.  At first glance, XRX debt levels appear high at ~$9B, roughly 3x EBITDA of $3B but the company provides financing to its customers, targeting a 7:1 leverage ratio. Currently, it holds over $1B cash to provide $6.2B to facilitate customers' purchases/leases of equipment. ""Core debt"" is a much more manageable $2.4B, less than a year's EBITDA. The company is exposed to debt write-offs among its customer base -- current bad debt provisions as a percentage of trade/finance receivables came in at 3.3%, 4.1% and 3.4% for 2010, 2009 and 2008 respectively -- but barring a catastrophic credit event surpassing the crisis in 2008, this exposure is manageable.  As with any stock, XRX is not without risk. Other tech companies have also moved into services and at least one, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HPQ), competes in both hardware and services. At $11B market cap, XRX is one of the smaller operators in the space and may not be able to compete effectively in the marketplace or for acquisitions:Additionally, Xerox lists $2.1B pension funding shortfall on its balance sheet as well as $913M for retiree medical benefits, which are not funded by any plan. $3B+ in unfunded pension and health benefits is worrisome enough but Xerox derived these figures by assuming over 7% growth in its pension plan assets and less than 5% growth in long-term retiree healthcare costs. It is probable that Xerox's actual liabilities exceed the $3B carried on its liabilities ledger. For reference, assuming 2010's healthcare cost trend rate of 9% boosts retiree medical costs by $352M. A smaller risk is management, which I feel are too ""Wall Street""-oriented. Simply reviewing the Q2 earnings call, investors can hear the CFO talk about ""protecting the quarter"", which signals undue emphasis on pleasing analysts. Companies should be managed for the long term -- quarters do not need to be protected. Unfortunately, Xerox management obtains additional compensation for meeting EPS and cash flow targets, which explains protecting the quarter. The company also favors share buybacks over dividends to return capital to shareholders. I prefer dividends as companies tend to buy back shares when things are good, i.e. share prices are high, and suspend buyback programs in panic-stricken markets precisely when shares are cheap. Also, companies can issue shares again in the future to fund acquisitions. Xerox shares are trading low enough to make a buyback attractive but future acquisitions funded by equity dilution cannot be ruled out. Still, the dividend is decent at over 2% so this is not a huge concern.At current trading levels though, investors are being compensated for these risks and then some. I initiated my position by writing in-the-money $7.5 naked puts on XRX for a 12% premium to take advantage of elevated volatility premiums and to set a lower entry price for the stock. My options have since moved out of the money but with today's markets, I suspect opportunities to build a position will become available again.

272297,22130,2011-05-27T15:28:57-04:00,,"Xerox (NYSE:XRX) is just plain cheap based on free cash flow. The acquisition of ACS (Affiliated Computer Services), which had good cash flow characteristics, was done at a fair price; and moderately favorable conditions in the Office Imaging Industry will permit the company to put on the next growth ring. At recent prices in the $10 area, patient value investors will be rewarded.I was long ACS when Xerox announced the acquisition in September 2009, and booked a nice profit. The deal was worth $63.11 per share, somewhat under my estimate of fair value, which stood at $67. ACS had some debt, but tended to report earnings that were about half of cash flow, implying considerable financial strength. I bought XRX on the dip induced by the news, on the grounds it was trading at 8.5 X 5 year average EPS, but closed the position shortly thereafter. According to my notes: ""I didn't think XRX was the sort of thing I would buy on purpose so I closed out the trade.""The bullish case for Xerox has been capably presented here on Seeking Alpha a number of times, most recently by Bret Jensen, and earlier this year by Common Cents and Frank Constantino. Rather than doing a complete writeup, this article focuses on a discussion of free cash flow, which I believe is critical to an understanding of profit potential for this value candidate.Investor ConferenceKey executives presented at the Xerox Corporation 2011 Investor Conference on 5/10/2011. The following slide is taken from a presentation by CFO Luca Maestri - (click chart to expand): The company projects free cash flow at $10 billion over the next 5 years. Much of that is expected to be returned to shareholders, as dividends and buybacks.Discounted Cash Flow ValuationAveraging the company's projections for free cash flow for 2011, and 2012, I arrive at $1.47 per share. WACC (weighted average cost of capital) is the crucial issue. 80% of Xerox's debt is incurred at a 7 to 1 leverage ratio to finance customer purchases on leases or notes with an average maturity of 4 years. Xerox's bonds maturing in 3-5 years trade to yield a little over 3%. Bonds maturing 10 years and over are trading to yield something over 6%. Long term debt to equity was 36.2% as of 12/31/2010.At a $10.20 share price when I did the computations, the free cash flow yield is 14.4%. Giving that 2/3 weight, and doing the other 1/3 at 6%, WACC works out to 11.6%. Using $1.47 free cash flow per share, increasing that 4% annually for 5 years, and 1% thereafter, I apply a WACC of 11.6% and arrive at a value of $15.82.Here's something to consider. The company is buying back shares. Maestri projects 65 million (4.6%) for 2011, and 100 million (7.4%) for 2012. The company has no need to access the equity markets, and capital for the most common purpose can be raised at 3.25% to 6%, depending on duration. Maturities will be well matched, as mentioned above. Under the circumstances, a conventional DCF computation may understate value, as it overstates cost of capital.I personally think that the DCF valuation method employs circular reasoning - if the market applies a low P/E, DCF simply validates the current price - the cost of capital is high because the stock is cheap. If Xerox wants to lend a customer some money so he can buy a photocopy machine, it can borrow the funds at 3.25% to 6%. That's its cost of capital.The cost of equity capital is irrelevant. Xerox is buying back its own shares, paying less than they're worth. As will be demonstrated later, if the company continues to buy back shares and P/FCF remains constant, share prices will increase 7.5% annually. That's not cost of capital, it's return on capital.The Market Doesn't Recognize Value The main argument against these shares is the market won't pay for them. Xerox is old tech, a buggy whip manufacturer. Ten years ago it was overweight and out of date. The company was operating at a loss, and long term debt as a percentage of capitalization stood at 82.5%. Xerox's iconic stature was lost, never to be regained. Xerox as a term for a photocopy is right up there with Ameche as slang for a telephone.Two arguments can be made. The first asserts that labeling Xerox as a manufacturer of copy machines over-simplifies and under-rates the business. The second relies on the power of cash flow, judiciously applied.Buyback Ad InfinitumConfronted with a large buyback situation, when combined with a low price, it is sometimes instructive to ask the question, what if this goes on for some indefinite period of time into the future? Holding free cash flow, cash flow expended on buying back shares, and P/FCF constant, Xerox's current program would increase share prices by 7.5% per year. Add a 1.7% dividend, and the total return is not bad.Applying increases to free cash flow of 4% for five years, and 1% thereafter, share prices would increase 11.8% per year for 5 years, and 8.4% thereafter. Add the dividend, and total return is impressive.If share prices go down temporarily, absent a change in outlook, the situation becomes more attractive. If share prices go up, to the point where future returns don't look as good, the investor can liquidate his position at a profit.Strategy and TacticsIf the buybacks proceed along the lines projected, the process will apply pressure that should force share prices up toward a target of $16, as developed by the DCF calculation. Lacking any immediate catalyst, it's difficult to predict when the move will occur. Because XRX is a low prestige stock, there is no reason to anticipate that moves will be large or rapid. Patience is required.For dividend investors, the dividend at 1.7% is not that large, although the company demonstrably has the resources to raise it. There is a reasonable expectation that share prices and dividends will increase over time. Looking at the long term, free cash flow yield is 14.7% and the company has stated the intention of returning a large part of it to shareholders.Options XRX is optionable, to include LEAPS. There is sizable open interest, and the options trade in penny increments with narrow spreads. Implied volatility checks in at 28.4%, with beta at 1.6.Looking at the options chain, there is large open interest for the Jan 2012 and 2013 10.0 calls, which are quoted at .95/.98 and 1.71/1.76 respectively. An investor who buys the shares at yesterday's close of $9.98 and sells the Jan 2012 10.0 call at .96 stands to earn 14.7% annualized if called away at expiration.Buying at $9.98 and selling the Jan 2013 10.0 call at $1.73 yields 10.5% annualized if called away at expiration. I left the dividend out of the computation, reasoning that at some point the possibility of early exercise for the dividend will arise.There is also quite a bit of open interest on the July 2011 9.0 and 10.0 puts. My guess is that they have been sold by investors who don't mind owning the shares at that price and are looking to collect premium while they wait. Selling either the October 9.0 and 10.0 puts looks good to me. I'm short the July 9.0 puts, sold back in March.Under the circumstances, Xerox is attractive for investors who are looking for yield and are comfortable selling either covered calls or cash-secured puts.Disclosure: I'm long XRX Jan 2012 7.5 calls and short XRX Jul 9.0 puts"

Norwalk-based Xerox  Corp. earned a profit of 29 cents in the fourth quarter, barely  exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate.In the upcoming quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Xerox Inc. is  pegged at a profit of 22 cents per share, reflecting an annualized  growth of 21%. The downside potential of the estimate, essentially a  proxy for future earnings surprises, is just 4.55%.  With respect to earnings surprises, the company outdid the Zacks  Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters. This is reflected in  the average earnings surprise of 16.58%, with positive surprises in each  of the quarters involved.Fourth Quarter ReviewXerox reported a profit of $417 million or 29 cents per share in the  fourth quarter of 2010, barely exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate by  a penny. The profit was higher than the year-ago level of $235 million or 26 cents per share.Revenues in the  quarter surged 42% to $5.98 billion, in line with the Zacks Consensus  Estimate. The rise in revenues was driven by an impressive growth in the  Services segment, comprising document outsourcing (DO), business  process outsourcing (NYSE:BPO) and information technology outsourcing (ITO)  businesses.Gross margin  declined to 33.6% from 39.9% a year ago due to the unfavorable impact of  currency exchange rates and mix impact from the acceleration of growth in BPO and ITO revenues. However, operating margin rose to 10.4% from 7.9% due to higher revenues.Revenues in the Technology segment slid marginally to $2.85 billion  from $2.86 billion last year, driven by flat supplies revenue. The  segment profit increased $31 million to $301 million from the last year.The increase in profit was attributable to lower cost and expense  reflecting restructuring savings and lower bad debt expense, which more  than offset the decline in gross profit caused by the unfavorable impact  of transaction currency and mix.Revenues in the Services segment nearly tripled to $2.71 billion from  $928 million in the fourth quarter of 2009. This was attributable to a  stupendous growth in revenues to $1.48 billion from $24 million in BPO  services, which accounted for 54% of total revenue in the segment.The growth in BPO services was driven by healthcare services, customer  care, transportation solutions, healthcare payer services and  acquisitions completed in 2010. The segment profit quadrupled to $324  million from $81 million in the previous year.Revenues in the Other segment declined 3% to $420 million from $434  million a year ago. However, the segment showed a narrower loss of $66  million compared with $79 million a year ago.Xerox had cash and cash equivalents of $1.21 billion as of December 31,  2010, compared with $3.8 billion in the year-ago period. Total debt  amounted to $8.61 billion, reflecting a debt-to-capitalization ratio of  42%, down from the year-ago level of 57%.Estimate Revisions TrendThe first quarter 2011 estimate remained unchanged at 22 cents. This  implies that the analysts are cautious about the stock. The overall  macro economic condition has marred the near-term visibility of the  analysts.Agreement of Estimate RevisionsOnly 1 out of the 10 analysts covering the stock for the first quarter  of fiscal 2011 has made a downward revision in the last 30 days.  However, no upward revision has been made in the past 30 days.  Intensifying competition and availability of close substitutes for the  company’s products have kept the analysts cautious about the stock.Magnitude of Estimate RevisionsThe first quarter 2011 estimate remained unchanged  at 22 cents in the last 60 days. However, the estimate witnessed a  penny drop from the previous 23 cents immediately following the fourth  quarter earnings release in January. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for  the first quarter is 22.2% higher than the year-ago profit of 18 cents.Our TakeXerox is a highly  recognized brand globally with an estimated brand value of $6.1 billion.  Xerox is highly focused on expanding its business globally based on its  well-knit distribution network. The company has also identified a huge  scope in the domestic markets and in the emerging markets for expanding its business.In order to seize the opportunities in the emerging markets, Xerox  partnered with Trigon last year to offer its authorized products for the  first time in the UAE. The company also appointed Seven Seas, a  UAE-based systems integrator and reseller, as its channel partner with  an objective of expanding its indirect channel business and boosting its  market share.The company has also taken similar initiatives in the domestic market  as well. The recent acquisitions by GIS reflect this fact. Apart from  Iowa-based Premier Office Equipment, GIS also acquired Illinois-based  United Business Solutions and Pensacola-based Florida Imaging &  Network Systems recently with the same objective.With all these agreements, contracts and acquisitions, Xerox aims to  capitalize on the growing market in order to strengthen its financial  performance in the upcoming quarters.However, growing competition, advancement in IT, reduced demand for papers and other document equipment may emerge as potential threats to the company in the near future.We have a ‘Neutral’ recommendation for Xerox in the long term."

227511,22145,2010-09-28T17:04:21-04:00,,"By Alexander MoschinaSometimes, it’s an earnings surprise that sends shares  soaring.  Other times, it’s the successful launch of a new product, or a new CEO   takes the reins.But many times, the driving force behind a stock surge just  comes down to good, old-fashioned word-of-mouth.Exhibit A: Xerox  Corp. (NYSE: XRX). On  September 13, a Barron’s  cover story  detailed the company’s newfound success as a data services  provider. The  positive vibes resulted in a 9.7% spike for the shares.Obviously, one good article isn’t enough to sustain a  company’s  growth. But it’s what the article revealed about Xerox’s longer-term  future that should keep the  company growing for years to come.In fact, Barron’s predicts that Xerox shares could double  over the next year. And with good  reason. The Xerox brand is in the  middle of a major reinvention. After all, the  company doesn’t just make  copiers anymore…Xerox: The Name in Printing for Nearly 50 YearsSince 1962, the Xerox name has been synonymous with making  copies… literally. After the company released the Xerox 914 – the world’s first plain paper photocopier – it became  the norm to say things like, “I’m going to xerox this memo.”The morphing of the word “Xerox” into the public domain  helped the  firm become one of the world’s strongest tech companies in the 1960s   and 1970s. In just a decade, it created the world’s first color copier,  the first  laser printer and even developed the first computer mouse.Fast-forward to 2010: Copiers and printers have become  commodities. Competitors like HP (NYSE: HPQ) and Lexmark (NYSE: LXK) are eating into  Xerox’s market share. And to top it off, the world is going digital.So if a traditional printing company is going to survive in  a market  like that, then it’s got to grow. And that’s just what Xerox has done…Xerox and ACS: A  Marriage Made in Tech Heaven?In February 2010, the company acquired data management  company ACS  for $6.2 billion. According to Xerox CEO, Ursula Burns, ACS’  expertise  in IT Outsourcing makes it a “game-changer” for Xerox.She added that the partnership will expand the Xerox  business and  grow its revenue. And so far, things are off to a great start…Blodgett states: “Xerox has been willing to open their  accounts to us and inversely we do the same.”Since February, Xerox has trained more than 300 of its  general  account managers to cross-sell the companies’ products and services   internationally. For customers, that means one-stop shopping. And for  Xerox and  ACS, it’s a strategy that will further establish the Xerox  brand in the digital  marketplace and drive both divisions’ profits  higher.As CEO Burns states: “In a few years, I want [Xerox] to  be known  as the largest and the best global business-process-management and   document-management company.”By the looks of things, that will be no problem…2010 has already been a huge year for Xerox. Annual revenue  was up  48% in the second quarter and the company has raised its 2010 EPS   guidance to $0.88 to $0.92 per share. But this is just the beginning.  Between  ACS’ international growth and cross-sales leading to new  contracts, 2011 could  be even better.Disclosure: Investment U expressly forbids its writers from having a  financial interest in any security they recommend to our subscribers.

The big question is what comes next.Xerox announced the acquisition of ACS in September and initially the deal raised a few eyebrows. However, the two companies argue that together they will have the technology and know-how to become a leading business process outsourcing (BPO) company with unique capabilities.I spoke to Jim Firestone, president of corporate operations at Xerox, and Lynn Blodgett, CEO of ACS, on the closing of the deal, the short-term and long-term plans and what the customer will see.  On the 100-day plan:Firestone said Xerox and ACS have put together an integration team that has been working for a couple months. Here’s a look at the four items on the to-do list:Blodgett added that there are about 60 different projects within the 100-day plan. The companies aren’t trying to do anything crazy—like have Xerox salespeople suddenly selling business process outsourcing services. Overall, Blodgett added that there isn’t a lot of IT system consolidation. The approach to business processes such as finance and accounting and human resources will mirror what ACS does for customers in some respects, he added.On what customers will see on day one:Firestone said that Xerox-ACS has identified customers where the merger could provide value. Some customers have already leveraged relationships with one company into bigger deals. Customers that have ACS for business process outsourcing (BPO) are now considering Xerox for managed print services as a way to consolidate vendors. “They like the fact that they can take advantage of more capabilities from one vendor,” said Firestone.Blodgett said the most important aspect of combining the companies is to avoid any disruption in products or services. On global expansion:Firestone said the real gains from the deal may occur as Xerox expands ACS’ global footprint. “Xerox has strong established operations in large countries around the world,” said Firestone. “We have prioritized markets around the world and can grow through acquisition or start by landing a large contract. The first order of business is protecting and growing the U.S. market, which is the largest for both ACS and Xerox. After that Xerox will try to grow ACS’ presence in Europe where it already has BPO deals in the United Kingdom. “We can build off that base,” said Firestone.In addition, ACS, which has multiple contracts running transportation systems like EZPass, will also look to grow in developing markets where infrastructure is being built.On technology synergy:When asked about a specific scenario where ACS could use Xerox technology Firestone laid out the following example.ACS runs the IT behind the EZPass system and processes “a tremendous amount of transactions,” but many of them require human eyes to look at license plate numbers and violations, explained Firestone. Xerox has technology that can identify those details electronically and deliver more information about car types. Put together, Xerox and ACS can provide better services. That same example could apply to ACS’ services for the government like Medicaid form processing.“The most readily attackable thing is Xerox’s technology around imaging,” said Blodgett. “We will be able to do a lot more things with Xerox technology. We deal with 100s of billions of images annually and we can handle unstructured data a lot more easily with Xerox technology.”  On the future of BPO:Blodgett said BPO is in transition. Initially, BPO was all about the labor arbitrage—outsourcing processes and the labor that goes with them to save money. “Today it’s about technology enabled business processes,” said Blodgett. He added that BPO and IT are coming together and attracting customers. Firestone added that the growth picture is solid for BPO.Original post"

It now appears as if about 80% of their revenues are recurring vs. one time revenues so hopefully that means the earning forecast is conservative. Xerox growth has been anemic and the market has currently placed a low p/e on the stock, but that creates an opportunity for multiple expansion. A conservative $1.10 earnings at a p/e of 12 yields a price of $13, or 20% up from here. A more aggressive view would be that if the company can earn $1.20 in 2012 and p/e expands to an average 15 a price of $18 is possible.These fundamentals indicate an opportunity might exist in this stock. However, numbers don't tell the whole story. It is always important to look beyond the numbers to see what changes are going on at a company. In the case of Xerox it appears it appears there are several winds of change blowing that support the fundamental case for the stock. Here are a few of the changes going on at Xerox. All these changes can create a tail wind for the stock allowing it to reach $13 this year and hopefully continue on a path to $18. Technical analysis indicates there is short term support around $10.50 and the 200 dma is at $10.26. Acquiring and initial lot slightly above these levels seems appropriate. That can be accomplished by either a purchase at today's price of $10.90. Alternatively, selling Mar $11 puts for about .40 cents could likely get an entry point around $10.60 next week. A potential 3% saving in price with the only “risk” being the stock goes up next month, the option ends up out of the money, the portfolio gets a 3% 1 month return, and there is a need to look for a new entry approach.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in XRX over the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: This posting is for informational, educational and entertainment purposes only and should not be considered investment advice."

On  earnings per share basis, the company has beaten the Zacks Consensus  Estimate by a penny with a profit of 22 cents compared with 17 cents in  the third quarter of 2009.Revenues for the quarter surged 48% to $5.43 billion driven by an  impressive growth in the Services segment, comprising document  outsourcing (DO), business process outsourcing (NYSE:BPO), and information  technology outsourcing (ITO) businesses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate  was $5.42 billion.Gross margin declined to 33.6% from 39.8% a year ago due to higher cost  of sales, service, outsourcing and rentals. However, operating margin  improved to 9.2% from 6.7% due to higher revenues.Performance by SegmentRevenues in the Technology segment inched up 3% to $2.47 billion,  driven by a 15% rise in equipment sales. The segment profit increased  $13 million to $247 million from the last year.Revenues in the Services segment nearly tripled to $2.55 billion from  $865 million in the second quarter of 2009.

Brean Murray recently stated that it remains a buyer of Xerox shares as they believe upside exists to FY09 Street EPS of 53c--Brean is at 57c--most likely in the December quarter and perhaps the September quarter on cost savings and cost management. That it's base case for Xerox, ex-Affliliated Computer Systems, or ACS, FY10 EPS of 76c and FY11 of 90c-$1.00 is strong enough to achieve their target. Also that ACS provides downside protection/upside potential of at least 3c-5c in FY10 and 3c-10c in FY11. Finally, Brean believes the finalization of the ACS deal closure can uniquely serve as a positive stock catalyst for Xerox. Brean expects that Xerox will spend much of the earnings call discussing the ACS deal merits. The most pressing questions are: what is the strategy of the ""new Xerox"", what are the areas and quantification of revenue and cost synergies incremental to Xerox's stated $300M-$400M annually by year three after deal close, what will be the balance sheet and cash generation potential of the new entity, and uses of cash on the balance sheet."

So, it's not an everyday happening when one woman gets to hand the reins to another, but that's exactly what's going on at Xerox Corp. (NYSE:XRX). When Anne Mulcahy retires as CEO on July 1, Ursula Burns will fill her shoes.Burns has worked her way up from a summer internship as a mechanical engineer in 1972 to her current position as president. But Burns takes over at a critical time when the company still has some challenges to overcome. The Norwalk, Conn.-based company has seen its first-quarter revenue fall 18% year-over-year while its stock dropped nearly 50% over the last year during the global economic crisis.Xerox, however, is certainly in better health since its dark days nearly a decade ago when some media outlets were predicting bankruptcy, as it was stymied by accounting irregularities that forced the company to  restate its earnings between 1997 to 2001. Additionally, at the time, the company did not have a diverse revenue stream, existing primarily as a photocopying business. It is Mulcahy who gets the credit for rescuing the company from accounting anomalies and sagging sales. ""As CEO, Anne successfully led a multibillion-dollar turnaround of Xerox and transformed the business into an innovative digital technology and services enterprise,"" says N.J. Nicholas, Jr., lead independent director of Xerox's board of directors.Mulcahy orchestrated a flurry of deals, divesting some units and adding others, including the $32 million purchase of mortgage documentation company Advectis Inc.; the $1.5 billion purchase of Global Imaging Systems Inc. in 2007; and the $174 million purchase of litigation electronic processing firm Amici LLC in 2006.

The consensus estimate is 11c for EPS and $3.72B for revenue, according to First Call. Management provided Q2 guidance on its last earnings call of 10c to 12c, which was below the then consensus of 14c. The company predicted FY09 EPS of 50c to 55c, also below the then consensus of 58c. On that same call management reiterated that it will deliver $250M in savings throughout 2009 from previous restructuring actions, as well as an additional $300M in non-restructuring cost and expense reductions. The company also said it's on track for $300M in capital expenditures and $1.3B in cash from operations for FY09, driven by cost actions and working capital improvements. During Q2 Xerox unveiled a new office machine, the ""ColorQube"", that promises to cut the cost of color printing by 62%. Xerox doesn't expect the printer to contribute much to earnings until 2010. The company is bracing for a long period of penny-pinching among customers to last for at least the next couple of quarters, as printing and copying are discretionary costs and the first eliminated to shrink budgets. Still, analysts don't expect things to get much worse for the company. Xerox has said sales have stabilized after customers drew down their inventories when the recession deepened last year. On July 21 Brean Murray initiated coverage of Xerox with a hold rating. The firm's estimates are in-line with Street revenue and EPS estimates for Q2 and Q3, and they believe upside to the Street estimate is required to move the stock appreciably higher. That said, Brean doesn't see any real negative surprises on the call and believes Xerox could land at the high end, or perhaps exceed, 2009 EPS guidance, provided a very solid December quarter. Brean does feel that commentary from management will characterize demand as challenging with some uncertainty attached to it, particularly in Europe and emerging markets"

But there's more. The legendary lab has been in the news lately because Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) bought a search technology company called Powerset for an alleged $100 million. Powerset was built on technology licensed from PARC. The lab has also won some attention in the past week for unveiling a way to print documents so the ink disappears in a day, allowing the paper to be reused. Sure, a lot of people want to keep printouts, but if it's, say, a restaurant menu that will change tomorrow -- this could save a lot of paper.A couple of weeks ago, I stopped in at the lab and talked with its president, Mark Bernstein. PARC these days operates as a partially-owned subsidiary of Xerox -- a stand-alone business that has to make money by licensing its inventions and spinning off companies. It's been getting into all kinds of areas, like using its competence in laser technology to develop better diagnostic tools for blood.Bernstein told me about one project I thought was pretty cool: a chip on a small sticker that can keep track of concussive forces that hit it and report when the forces add up to a certain amount of damage. It could be used on helmets of soldiers, or on high school football helmets. Since concussive damage can be cumulative, Bernstein told me, the sticker could warn its wearer when damage might start to get serious.PARC is working on ways to keep a mobile device user connected and active on a Web site even if the wireless connection is interrupted -- something Bernstein calls content-centric networking. Bernstein seemed particularly proud of an invention unveiled this year called a ""spiral concentrator."" It seems simple, but is based on complex, precise physics. Water flows through a spiral of tubes set up so that polluting particles are forced to the sides of the tubes. The particles get trapped and clean water comes out -- a cheap, low-energy way to purify water. ""That one excites me,"" Bernstein said. All in all, PARC is still there, still contributing, and may be on as solid a footing as ever."

On March 20 Xerox sharply cut its Q1 earnings forecast to between 3c and 5c, compared to the previous guidance of 16c to 20c. The company blamed it on “the increasingly more challenging global economic environment.” Xerox said the reduction included a 6c impact arising from costs of restructuring the Fuji Xerox joint venture, “with the balance resulting from an industry wide slowdown in technology spending.” The company said its revenue in January and February was down 18%, including a five point hit from currency, “largely due to lower sales of equipment and printer-based supplies.” Xerox also expects enterprise spending on technology to continue its downward trend in 2009. Xerox further stated that it's on course to save $250M this year from previous restructuring initiatives and has identified a further $300M in expense reductions.

Moreover, the company said it is confident in the health of its business, and does not believe that it will have to raise additional capital in the foreseeable future. Few analysts write on the company these days. Deutsche Bank analyst Chris Whitmore sees more pain for Xerox as companies continue to skimp on IT spending because of economic uncertainty. ""We continue to believe printing and copying are the most discretionary purchases within IT budgets and corporations are likely to continue reducing/delaying equipment purchases,"" Whitmore told investors in a recent client note. On the other hand, Whitmore said ""modest"" revenue from the company's ""post-sale"" business -- sales of ink and other equipment to customers who already own Xerox printing and copy machines -- should help offset weaker hardware sales.

This should block year end tax selling which must look awfully attractive in this kind of market.Since launching its stock buyback program in October 2005, Xerox has repurchased about 129 million shares to date, totaling $2 billion of its $2.5 billion program. This is approximately equal to what their net earnings have been for approximately the same period. The long term debt to book equity is approximately 1:1.

The benefits are clear: Xerox’s paper uses half as many trees as regular paper, is 10 percent lighter than the alternative, and requires less water and chemicals. The paper also uses less fuel to produce. Xerox should find a receptive audience among direct-mail centers and bill, statement and invoice printers. In a statement, here’s how Xerox describes the process: The rub: Xerox’s environmentally friendly paper isn’t designed for documents you plan to archive. Xerox’s paper has a brightness level of 84 on a scale of 100. The brightest paper is whitened with chlorine. Xerox’s effort will be a clear win for enterprises because they save money and a few trees. The real tell will be what happens when this paper goes consumer.

When I previewed the report I said “can they make the numbers without asking investors to ignore a bunch of stuff? I don’t doubt they will earn $0.27 as expected but wonder how they’ll get there.” Well, as it turns out they didn’t ask investors to ignore a bunch of stuff. Unfortunately, however, the report still didn’t strike me as being particularly strong. I’ll run down a few of my observations. So… 4% growth excluding the currency benefit and $100-$200 million from Global Imaging, the sales looked about flat. With Global Imaging having clocked in $1 billion in sales last year, it should be expected to boost sales by 6.25% in its first full quarter as a Xerox subsidiary, or slightly more than half that in the partial quarter just completed. Xerox is spending billions of dollars on acquisitions not to grow but to stay in place. They keep saying that. I’m still waiting for them to prove it. For example, during the second quarter, install activity increased 54 percent for the company’s color multifunction devices that print, copy, fax and scan. But revenue from color grew 12 percent in the second quarter and now represents 38 percent of Xerox’s total revenue, up 4 points from the second quarter of 2006. Why isn’t the sales keeping up with the install rate? Shouldn’t all those installs be generating post-sale revenue by now? I don’t need to add anything there. After beating in the current quarter, the high end of the guidance range for the rest of the year only matches consensus. That is the equivalent of cutting guidance in the coming quarters. With sales up just 7% (including all the aforementioned benefits), accounts receivable and inventories are up 11% year to date. Some of that increase, however, may be seasonal. Cash flow from operations were up for the quarter and year-to-date, but only because the company contributed less to its underfunded pension plan than it did last year. Excluding pension contributions (which are discretionary), the cash flow would have been down. Long story short, there is nothing to shout about with Xerox’s earnings. XRX 1-yr chart:"

28216,20171,2007-02-27T17:34:01-05:00,,"When we recently criticized Xerox (NYSE:XRX) for it’s practice of taking restructuring charges in each of the last seven years while suggesting investors treat them as one-time events, a company representative noted that: Our response: Money News:- Xerox Cuts Outlook on Restructuring   We applaud Xerox for actually taking the numbers down to reflect this new charge. We hope they also insist that analysts do the same thing when reporting their estimates to First Call. However, our guess is that when it comes time for the earnings report all eyes will be on the number excluding this charge. Speaking of this charge, Xerox’ participation in the Fuji Xerox JV is accounted for using what is known as the equity method. According to the company’s latest 10K, “Equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates of $114 million, principally related to our 25% share of Fuji Xerox income, which increased by $16 million in 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to improved operational performance.” In both 2005 and 2006 the Fuji Xerox venture contributed nearly 10% of the net income reported by Xerox, without muddying up the “revenue” or “expense” lines. It is a simple adjustment, however, to see how net margin would be affected by looking at only the operations for which Xerox fully reports results. All that is needed is to subtract “equity in net income of unconsolidated affiliates” from net income, which we do in the table below.  As expected, net margin is lower when you take out portions that are treated as 100% profit (all costs are off the financial statements). There is also a smaller improvement in margin (130 basis points rather than the 140 reported) in 2006, but a larger one in 2005 when adjusted numbers are used. In addition, the growth in net income is higher in both periods when using the adjusted number. Overall, this analysis tells us that the company’s non-JV business was starting in worse condition that was apparent, but showed more significant improvement relative to taking the numbers at face value. By understanding how the accounting requirements as well as any management discretion used when applying them, investors can piece together more of the puzzle."

Although the company frequently points to the strong growth in their color and digital product lines, it never seems to be enough for overall sales growth to keep pace with economic growth, because declining older businesses take it all away. What’s more, the suggestion that shareholders treat restructuring charges as one-time events stretches credulity when the company records them every year. One thing that is beyond dispute, however, is that the company has been reducing its debt burden. And that is likely to lend the company a hand when it comes to borrowing costs, according to a recent Reuters article: Much of the remaining debt at Xerox is funding the company’s customer financing efforts. However, until the company can start increasing its cash flow line, we don’t see the shares as being a compelling value. XRX 1-yr chart:"

Sorry Xerox but when you’ve taken restructuring charges in each of the last seven years (perhaps more - we didn’t bother going back farther), you stretch credulity by asking investors to take them out as “one-time” items. On an unadjusted basis, your earnings were $0.22 per share and far below expectations. At least the company finally had a year/year increase in cash from operations. Yet the 3% growth in sales was entirely attributable to changes in currency exchange rates, not operating performance. In other words, not only did the company not grow its underlying business, but they also managed to negate any contributions to sales that were provided by the companies they acquired. OK, so down 4% in operating terms. How is the company going to generate the “annuity” supply and maintenance revenue if there are fewer machines to supply and maintain? How about more sales rather than more announcements? Xerox guided to first-quarter 2007 earnings between $0.21 and $0.23, right in line with the 22-cent consensus. We’re sure they will report at least $0.22. The real surprise would be if they did it on an unadjusted basis. XRX 1-yr chart:"
19086,20271,2006-10-24T09:52:53-04:00,,"The last few years have been tough for Xerox Corp. (NYSE:XRX), with the office-equipment maker lagging industry averages for sales and earnings growth. There were bright signs for the company on Monday as the company reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, and its shares climbed nearly 2 percent in morning trading. Analysts are also optimistic about Xerox. A quick analysis, however, suggests those looking for big gains in the stock price may be disappointed as the good news has already been factored in. Over the last five years, and in the trailing 12-month [TTM] period and most recent quarter [MRQ] prior to the latest announcement, revenue and earnings per share [EPS] growth have significantly fallen short of the averages for the office equipment industry.  Taking into consideration its recent performance, Xerox appears to be priced at a discount to the office equipment industry on the basis of key valuation metrics, including price to earnings (P/E) and P/Sales.  The company's 2 percent increase in revenue to $3.84 billion in the quarter ended September not only beat the consensus estimate of $3.81 billion but also marked a solid improvement from the trends above. The relatively favorable news is even more pronounced at the earnings level. As indicated above, EPS had been contracting. But the company's actual EPS of 23 cents in the latest quarter not only surpassed the consensus of 22 cents according to analysts in a Reuters poll, but also marked a 28 percent year-over-year increase. Yet, the news from the latest earnings announcement wasn't all positive. Much of the top-line gain came from sales of color printers and related items and services, but total equipment-sale revenue slipped 1 percent amid competitive pricing pressure. According to the company, the product mix hurt profit margins. The gross profit narrowed 1.1 percentage points from the year-earlier period to 40.2 percent. As indicated below, this is also narrower than the company's five-year average. (Results below are based on available information prior to the latest earnings announcement.)  Nonetheless, Xerox expects EPS in the range of 33 cents to 37 cents in the final three months of this year. Analysts are optimistic on the company's performance, with the consensus average at the top end of this range. Moreover, analysts look for further revenue and EPS gains down the road. They expect revenue to approach $15.9 billion this year and rise to nearly $16.3 billion in 2007. EPS is expected to hit $1.03 this year and climb to $1.16 in 2007. Further, analysts believe that Xerox can grow its earnings at an average annual clip of about 9.6 percent going forward. Based on EPS estimates for 2006 and 2007, Xerox is priced at forward P/E ratios of roughly 15.8 and 14.1, respectively. Dividing these P/E ratios by the expected long-term EPS growth rate yields PEG ratios. Typically, more-conservative value-oriented investors prefer to focus on companies with PEG readings below 1.00, but numbers below 2.00 are often still reasonable. Xerox has PEG ratios of about 1.6 for 2006 and 1.5 for 2007. Our back-of-the envelope analysis of Xerox, which takes into consideration its historical performance along with analyst estimates, indicates that the company can grow its earnings at an average annual clip of about 8.3 percent, which is slightly slower than what analysts expect. But, it is also close to the 8.6 percent EPS growth that our analysis suggests is required to justify the current stock price.

25559,20171,2007-01-30T14:33:35-05:00,,"In response to our somewhat heated reaction to Xerox’ (NYSE:XRX) earnings report, a Xerox employee submitted a comment outlining the Xerox perspective. Since the company appears to be interested in fostering an honest debate, we encourage investors to consider their side of the story as well as our own. Of course, Xerox has presented their side in press releases, conference calls and investor conferences already, but there is certainly no harm in seeing it again here. So we present the comment, along with our response, as this article. Warning: This is a long article. For those who lack the patience to read it all, our key points are: Enough of the summary, here’s the beef. Xerox: When assessing Xerox’s financial performance, it’s important to understand these key facts. Here’s the view from Xerox:- First Call estimate for Xerox’s Q4 earnings was 37 cents. That number did not include restructuring. While Xerox provided guidance on restructuring for Q4, analysts posted an adjusted EPS number that excluded any impact from restructuring. Compared to First Call and Xerox’s own Q4 guidance, Xerox did exceed expectations for the quarter at 38 cents adjusted EPS. Stock Market Beat: In the earnings release for the third quarter, management gave the following guidance: Right away we see two discrepancies: First, since Xerox guided toward the amount of the charge, the company was implicitly asking analysts and First Call to treat it as special. Given that Xerox has had restructuring charges in nine of the last ten years they are clearly anything but special, unique, unusual or uncommon. Why not insist that both analysts and first call include them and earn our plaudits as an example for others to follow? Second, the restructuring charge was $0.03 higher than expected, which resulted in “adjusted” earnings beating estimates while GAAP earnings were at the low end of the range. Did the analyst estimates incorporate the full $0.16 charge or the $0.13 for which they were guided? It brings to mind Warren Buffett’s admonition in the 1982 (we have long memories and access to search engines) letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders: Given that Xerox’ bubble-era accounting practices landed the company a case study in the book, surely you are aware of Howard Schilit’s Financial Shenanigans: How to Detect Accounting Gimmicks & Fraud in Financial Reports, Second Edition (aff. link). Shenanigan number 7 is “Shifting Future Expenses to the Current Period as a Special Charge.” One way to do so is to inflate the amount included in a special charge, as Xerox appears to have done in this period. Or consider the value investor’s bible, Graham and Dodd’s Security Analysis. They say: Or how about White, Sondhi and Fried’s The Analysis and Use of Financial Statements, which has been a key part of the curriculum for the CFA Exam for many years. They have this to say: And here is a reference from Financial Statement Analysis: A Global Perspective by Robinson, Munter and Grant, presented in a study of Motorola’s financial statemtents: The point of all these references is not to show how many books about financial analysis we have read, but to illustrate that there is a clear consensus that restructuring charges, particularly when they occur frequently, should not be ignored. In fact, they are “suspicious,” “disturbing” and indicate that “the firm’s quality of earnings is low.” If investors don’t believe the restructuring charges should count against the current period, they should adjust them to show the charges as operating expenses in a different year than when the charges were taken. However, since there are charges in pretty much every year, there doesn’t seem to be much point. We think Generally Accepted Accounting Principles [GAAP] does that job quite well and no adjustments are necessary."

19020,20171,2006-10-23T14:19:29-04:00,,"In the latest sign that corporate spending is mediocre, Xerox Corp. (NYSE:XRX) posted total sales growth of 2% year/year, half of which was due to currency fluctuations. Post-sale revenues (ink, toner, paper and services) were up 3% but equipment sales declined 1% (2% on a constant currency basis) as competitors like Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) and Canon (NYSE:CAJ) kept up the heat. As we noted in the past, if Xerox doesn’t sell equipment today, how can they expect to generate post-sale revenue tomorrow? The company beat earnings estimates (after adjusting for tax benefits and restructuring charges) by a penny, but appears to have taken back the penny when it comes to next quarter’s guidance. According to Yahoo! Finance: Given how frequently Xerox records restructuring expenses, we don’t think it is appropriate to treat them as one-time events, but that is a story for another day. The restructuring charges reduced EPS by $0.14. Also worrisome was the company’s working capital management. Year-to-date inventories are up more than 16% and receivables nearly 10%, though sales have grown just 1% from the first nine months of 2005. Expense management is coming not just from overhead but also from research and development, which could lead to further trouble down the road if the company finds itself out-innovated. However, we don’t look too harshly on the cuts in Xerox’ case because the company has a reputation for creating whiz-bang products that never make it to market. A more focused R&D effort could actually yield more with less, as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has shown. XRX 1-yr chart:"
11499,20171,2006-06-02T09:05:46-04:00,,"In the past, Xerox has relied extensively on customer financing and has been reducing their reserves for doubtful receivables - both trade receivables and financing receivables. Furthermore, the reduction in reserves does not appear to be resulting from improved collections, as the new amounts reserved each year have been less than the actual bad debt losses. Xerox has also avoided declining revenue primarily due to the temporary benefits of currency fluctuations. It also doesn’t hurt that analysts have stuck to their pattern of ignoring the “one-time” restructuring charges that seem to occur on an annual basis. Xerox is showing steady improvement. However, it is in a race to see whether these improvements can materialize before the company runs out of accounting levers and one-time benefits that are keeping up appearances. The new incentive program suggests to us that the race is far from over. XRX 1-yr chart:"
12059,20171,2006-06-14T05:55:12-04:00,,"TheStreet.com's Weighing Options With Robert Olstein included some comments on Xerox (NYSE:XRX) that had us a little puzzled. Our regular readers will recognize some of what we have to say from previous articles. We didn’t see much to argue with at first. Xerox has been paying down debt, and while we still see it as early goings, Anne Mulcahy is doing about as good a job as could be expected with the hand she was dealt. But the free cash flow yield part got us. We always thought of free cash flow as being cash from operations less capital expenditures. If a company uses acquisitions as part of its growth strategy, we usually count them as part of capital expenditures. Another way would be to look at the free cash flow available to equity holders, which takes into account changes in debt. If this is done, the reductions in debt actually reduce free cash flow to equity in the year the debt is repaid because that is money that could otherwise be given to equity owners. On the other hand, not having the interest expense and future obligation increases future free cash flow to equity. Either way, the CFFO-CapEx formula is the base number. Over the past three years, here is Xerox’ free cash flow:   Source: Xerox 10K for the period ending December 31, 2005. As plain as day, and despite rising net income, cash from operations has fallen, taking free cash flow with it. (Note: Our capex number includes both the property and equipment line and the capitalized software line, but this adjustment makes little overall difference). Well, to be fair Olstein didn’t say that free cash flow was rising - he said the free cash flow yield was 10 percent. The free cash flow yield is calculated by dividing free cash flow by enterprise value. Xerox has an enterprise value of $19 billion and free cash flow of $1.2 billion, resulting in a yield of 6.3 percent. It appears that Olstein is calculating the free cash flow yield based on market cap rather than enterprise value. This doesn’t make any sense, because the debt holders have first claim on the cash flow. The alternative measure, using free cash flow to equity over market cap, would have to take into account any changes in the debt level. Since, as Olstein points out, Xerox has been paying off debt, the paydowns should be deducted from the free cash flow number. Last year Xerox paid off $2.5 billion in debt, leaving it with a free cash flow to equity of negative $1 billion. In each of the last three years, debt reduction has more than equalled free cash flow. So by no appropriate measure does Xerox have a 10 percent free cash flow yield. Furthermore, unless they reverse the declines, it won’t be long before there is no free cash flow by any measure. The article continues: We can’t argue with that. XRX 1-yr chart:"
10161,20171,2006-05-01T18:00:17-04:00,,"We wrote about Xerox twice in the last couple of months (1, 2). This week’s Barron’s Magazine (full summary) takes a more positive look at the company’s prospects. 
As Canon (ADR: CAJ) is not a US company, its financials are a bit harder to come by. But Hewlett Packard (NYSE:HPQ) does not share that issue. It posted cash from operations of more than $8 billion on $2.4 billion of net income. Importantly, cash from operations rose despite a decline in net income, which suggests the net income drop may indeed be temporary. Xerox, meanwhile, has seen two consecutive years in which cash from operations fell despite rising net income. For Xerox, the suggestion is that net income is not telling the whole story.
The company last week posted disappointing profits on slumping revenue, but Xerox’s fortunes have improved since it is paring debt, generating free cash, funding its pension plan, buying back shares and is likely heading toward an investment-grade credit rating, Barron’s said .

Management has indeed done a good job cutting debt, although it did issue more than $700 million of new debt earlier this year to fund its customer financing activities. However, its pension and other post-retirement benefits remain under-funded by $3.5 billion despite contributions of $500 million and strong investment returns in 2005. XRX is generating free cash, but less of it each year due to the sinking cash from operations. That said, it probably is strong enough to shed its junk rating in favor of an investment grade credit outlook.
As Hemingway would say, “Isn’t it pretty to think so?” Unfortunately, the persistent cash flow declines suggest that this is a problem that has been festering for some time, not a one-quarter simple fix."

Revenue for Q1 06 dropped slightly from $3.771 billion last year to $3.695 billion. Operating profit fell from $210 million to $200 million. However, not all the news was bad. Anne M. Mulcahy, Xerox chairman and chief executive officer said:  Since the company has been focusing on the sales of these systems for the past several years, this actually appears to be part of a long term positive trend. But unit sales for some products did drop. It is a bit hard to swallow Xerox as a real turnaround story. Revenue has been flat for three years at about $15.7 billion a year. The final quarter of last year was strong with revenue of $4.25 billion and net income of $282 million. But now the company is faced with the issue of whether the next quarter or two will be much better than the Q1 disappointment. If the answer to the question is ""no"", then Xerox's stock has little room to run.

As we noted before, XRX claims in its 10K that:
So now we have equipment sales declining, but somehow the business model is working because post-sale revenue is up 1 percent after adjusting for unfavorable currency trends? Won’t the lower level of machines in the field (”MIF”) resulting from lower sales reduce future post-sale revenue? Or as we said before, management’s estimates for allocating revenue between equipment sales and post-sale revenue could have been incorrect, effectively boosting past revenue at the expense of causing future headwinds.
Today’s press release did not offer the specific disclosures necessary to determine whether our concerns over provisions for bad debt have been addressed. We will have to wait for the 10Q to get those answers. In the meantime, we should still find lots to say about Xerox’s financials."
10159,20171,2006-03-31T17:46:25-05:00,,"So, is there any similar dross floating around in the portfolio at Xerox? On pages 3-4 of the recently filed 10K, the company notes:
So, the company sells most of its products on a lease basis that allows them to recognize the sale up front even though the proceeds will be collected over time. This can be as innocuous as a consumer taking out a loan to buy a car. However, investors always need to be careful (see the GM example) when a company offers the financing itself as opposed to having a third party finance the sale. There is likely to be more pressure to offer financing to shakier customers in order to make a sale, as well as an opportunity to bury incentives in the financing as opposed to recognizing them as price reductions on the income statement, which would lower the top-line sales figure. So while the fact that a company offers financing for its customers is not always bad, it is a signal for investors to dig deeper into the numbers. On page 7 of the 10k, we get further information:
So it is only the revenue reported as “equipment sales” that is recognized up front. Any supplies and services revenue are recognized over the course of the lease. In the case of leases deemed rentals, the equipment portion is also recognized over the terms of the lease. Xerox tells us that most of its revenue is from sales type leases, but rentals are becoming more common. All in all, the higher the equipment sales, the higher the future post-sale revenue should be. However, that is not what is happening. While equipment sales increased 5% in 2004 and 1% in 2005, post-sale revenue declined by 1% and was flat for those respective periods. Management could be making incorrect assumptions about the allocation of revenue between equipment sales and post-sale revenue, which would have give sales and earnings an artificial boost in the early periods but act as a headwind in future periods. Given that management bonuses (source: Exhibits 10(e)(4) of 10k) were based on sales (30% of bonus in 2005, target not met) and earnings per share (40% of bonus, above target) there is an incentive for management to report higher revenue in the current period.
Meanwhile, the revenue attributable to finance income declined 6% in both 2004 and 2005. Excluding currency benefits, the decline was 10% in 2004 and 7% in 2005. On page 5 of the Management Discussion and Analysis, the company attributes these declines to lower equipment lease originations and a corresponding decrease in finance receivables. Part of the decline may have been required as a result of the company’s debt rating. On page 12 of the 10k, Xerox notes:
It is encouraging that there are third-party lenders willing to accept some of the credit customers. However, they may be able to choose which customers they accept, leaving Xerox with the higher-risk accounts. Further, if placing equipment is so dependent on financing it suggests that some sales may be weak ones. In fact, an alternate explanation for the decline in finance income would be that the company is offering very low cost financing in order to secure sales that can be booked up front (boosting reported financial performance and the associated management bonuses) in that period.
The decline in finance income is even more mysterious when you look at the allowance for losses on finance receivables. Each year the company estimates how much of its future financing receivables will go uncollected as bad debt. This bad debt provision is subtracted from financing income. Since the provision covers multiple years, the bad debt provisions accumulate into a balance called the allowance for doubtful accounts. Whenever a customer fails to pay, the actual bad debt is charged against this provision rather than against income in the period the debt goes unpaid. If actual bad debt exceeds (is less than) the estimated bad debt, the allowance for doubtful accounts will decline (increase). In the case of Xerox, the allowance for doubtful finance receivables declined by $9 million in 2003, $39 million in 2004 and $47 million in 2005, meaning that actual debt losses exceeded management’s estimates by those amounts in those years.  
Taking 2005 as an example, if the reported loss had been increased by $47 million ($33 million after applying a 30% tax rate) to reflect the actual loss, net income excluding one-time items would have been $875 million rather than $908 million - a decrease of 3.7%. Diluted earnings per share (NYSEARCA:EPS) from continuing operations would have been $0.87 rather than the $0.90 reported. Given that even the $0.90 was the lowest end of management’s beginning of year guidance of $0.90-$1.00, would management have received the 40% of their 2005 long-term incentive plan bonus had they used an estimate of bad debt that more closely matched the actual loss?
Finally, on page 13, the company offers a further risk statement relating to the overall level of customer financing:
At best Xerox is generating the majority of its sales through customer financing, and there is some risk to such sales. At worst, erroneous estimates may be resulting in reported earnings being higher than they should have been in recent periods. Investors should understand the ramifications of Xerox’s lease program (or that of any company they are considering an investment in) before making their decision."

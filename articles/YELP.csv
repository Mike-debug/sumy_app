A well-known name in the digital advertising space, the stock has lost over 40% of its market value YTD (year-to-date). At a P/S (price-to-sales) multiple of 1.54x and a P/B (price-to-book) multiple of 1.78x, the stock definitely appears cheap.However, there is a good enough reason why this advertising business is going down, despite the company's solid reputation and relatively strong balance sheet. And, as the pandemic continues, Yelp's core business will most likely suffer even more. Considering the underlying uncertainties and high level of risk, I contend that it is best to avoid Yelp in 2020.Founded in 2004 by Russel Simmons and Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp works by creating a directory of local and chain businesses and then connecting these businesses to consumers. The company offers free and premium services to the listed businesses. In the case of fully paid membership, businesses are charged a fixed amount per month based on the number of impressions. The ad-model is similar to that of Google, where paid members are listed at the top of the search functionality.The success of any advertising business is mainly associated with the level of overall economic activity and Yelp is no different.The company had highlighted signs of recovery in its second quarter earnings call and reiterated the various efforts it has put in to recover business in its recent local economic impact report.However, things are far from rosy and are in fact not even trending in the right direction. Covid-19 cases are rising and the U.S. labor market is slowing noticeably. Subsequently, demand for the majority of services remains lackluster.The story presented in Yelp's local economic report is also not very different.Business closures in the restaurant and retail sector have taken a turn for the worse.Although the company has highlighted the resilience of its home and local services, this category is not large enough to offset the business losses in other categories.We were told that the restaurant business and especially dine-in would recover significantly not before 2021. However, the recent report highlights a more dire situation. Of the total restaurant closures, a whopping 61% are not expected to reopen at all. The number of permanent closures is also not far behind if we consider other major consumer discretionary businesses, considered to be major revenue drivers for Yelp. In the absence of any more fiscal funding, the small business environment in the U.S. is pretty dire.Although Yelp's topline growth continued to grow quarter-over-quarter in 2019, the growth rate was nothing to get excited about.And then, the Covid-19 pandemic has caused a dramatic 32% YoY revenue decline in the second quarter of fiscal 2020.Analysts are expecting a steep revenue decline in fiscal 2020, and then a reversal in 2021. However, we can see that both revenues and EPS are expected to stay significantly below pre-Covid-19 levels even in fiscal 2021.Other key metrics are also hinting at much deeper problems with the company's business model. Yelp's paying advertising locations, a substitute for paying advertising accounts, was down 31% YoY to 549K in the second quarter. While the company had expected this metric to recover in the third quarter, it seems quite difficult considering the overall macroeconomic conditions in the U.S.High customer churn has been a key problem for the company since late 2017. At that time, the company made a dramatic change in the business model, from offering annual contracts to monthly contracts. Although this move led to a surge in total customers, the majority of these were not high-quality ones. Quite a number of customers prefer to opt for advertising only in strong seasons.The company's focus on small businesses is a major challenge for customer retention, considering that only 66% of small businesses survive at least for two years even in normal times. But these are pandemic times. While Yelp has not provided churn numbers, it is clear that this metric must be pretty dire in today's difficult environment, considering that consumer retention was already a challenge in good times.High churn implies that the company has to constantly add to its customer base to further grow. This requires a large sales force team. However, the company's focus on cost-cutting implies that it cannot expand its employee base rapidly. This will lead to a much slower recovery in the customer base in future quarters.Ironically, Yelp is rated with just two stars on its own website, which reflects the kind of brand loyalty that the company is enjoying.Responding to the crisis, Yelp has been focusing on cost-cutting initiatives. The company managed to reduce its operating costs by $71 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. Hence, although revenues dropped by 32% YoY to $169 million, the company has reported positive adjusted EBITDA of $11 million.Yelp has also increased its cash balance from $491 million at the end of the first quarter to $526 million at the end of the second quarter, mainly through positive operating cash flows and releasing restricted cash. The company has generated net operating cash flows worth $164 million and free cash flows of $129 million in the last 12 months. The total debt of $220.9 million is pretty manageable, considering ultra-low interest rates and more than sufficient cash balance.I also see a slight possibility of some big competitors such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (GOOGL) or Facebook (FB) acquiring this company in the near future. In that case, we may see share prices trending upward.Honestly, I do not see much upside in the stock at least until the end of 2021, considering the weak business environment and the very high possibility of prolonged U.S. economic recovery. Although the consensus target price is around $25.41, almost 29% higher than the last close, I find it pretty high.For investors to start relying on this stock, it is absolutely essential for Yelp to demonstrate substantial signs of revenue and profitability improvements. Until then, it is best for retail investors to avoid this stock."
4375999,105697,2020-09-23T16:59:17-04:00,"Yelp confirmed that 60% of business closures are now permanent.Q2 results reflect a testing period for Yelp.The company may appear cheap, but COVID-19 has completely changed the industry the company operates in and the viability of Yelp itself.","Note: I have written about Yelp previously, investors should see this as an update to my earlier article on the companySince my last article on Yelp (YELP), the company has struggled to kick on share price wise. Now, down 12% since then. Yelp's reliance on small businesses has hit the company hard over the last few months. While the greater transition to online booking will benefit the company, the ties to the restaurant and retail sectors are simply too strong, and in the current environment, that is not a great position to be in. While some may argue that Yelp is 'cheap' at current levels, investors must look forward and wonder where the future growth catalysts will actually come from.Yelp's revenues remain small-business focused, as they look to sell advertising space to local businesses so they can drive greater traction into stores. While previously this was a positive as Yelp became the go-to site for the small businesses as they could offer targeted marketing like no other, in this environment, it has become a liability. I highlighted this issue in my previous article and since then, Yelp has provided more clarity on how heavily small businesses are being affected by COVID-19 and the picture it creates doesn't look good.Yelp recently released its local economic impact report for the end of August. The opening of the report talked about how well businesses have adapted to the conditions of COVID-19, of course, this is the focus for Yelp that wants to create a more optimistic picture for investors. The actual figures in the report provide less optimism. The report shows that business closures have continued to rise through the last few months as well and there is no sign of it slowing down soon. Temporary business closures have, of course, slowed down as the United States has started to reopen but even then, over the last couple of months, this figure has started to slowly increase again. This will primarily be down to potential lockdowns on a state by state basis, depending on whether there are fears of a spike in cases on a local level.What is more concerning for investors is the consistent rise in permanent business closures since march. This figure now stands at 97,966. Since Yelp's last report in mid-July, there has been a 34% rise in permanent closures. Much of these closures are still weighted towards Restaurants, which was the sector with the most permanent business closures. Yelp highlights that some businesses have been resilient over the period such as professional services, but these businesses have little to do with Yelp as they are focused primarily on retail and hospitality. Currently, 60% of business closures are permanent, an outstanding figure that shows the effects COVID-19 has had on smaller entities are not temporary.I found the image that Yelp created for the businesses that are struggling to be quite powerful:Source: Yelp economic impact report - closures per 1000 businessesAs the image shows, the businesses that are heavily affected are many of the ones that Yelp relies on for their revenues.It is also important to point out that in a period of great adversity for many small businesses, having a poor relationship with Yelp does not help. That has been the case and is a big problem that the company still faces. Small businesses have already been facing weaker demand, but this is then exacerbated by the potential for poor reviews left on Yelp.Q2 results showed a heavily affected 3 months for Yelp. Revenue fell substantially to $169 million in comparison to $245 million in the same period of the prior year. Even though this beat expectations, shares still sank 12% following the results. It is clear to see that the market can see that Yelp's headwinds aren't going away anytime soon. This was actually outlined in the results by the company themselves. At the end of the quarter, Yelp started to see a recovery in consumer and advertising revenue; however, in July, site traffic actually started to plateau. The last part has a huge significance. It shows that the problems the company is currently facing will be lasting and there is no quick fix to the current scenario Yelp finds themselves in. This also shows that consumer demand isn't returning as quickly as some may have initially believed it would. Many people aren't yet prepared to go back into restaurants, much of this is due to the increasing availability of food deliveries through services such as Grubhub (GRUB) and Uber Eats (UBER). Many of the businesses that previously provided Yelp with local advertising revenue may not have the capacity to do so again and these businesses aren't even accounted for in Yelp's economic impact report.In 2019, Yelp reported $1.88 in EPS. That means at current prices, Yelp has a historic P/E of just over 10. However, the situation has now completely changed and Yelp will not see a return to this level of profitability any time soon. On a forward basis, analysts are expecting a full year 20 P/E of 31 cents in 2020. This gives Yelp a far more pricey P/E of 64. Results, thereafter, will significantly improve according to analysts as Q3 ($0.01) is expected to be heavily affected but Q4 shows a sharp recovery in profitability ($0.26) - Q4 has always been a pivotal period for Yelp. Analysts see an EPS of $1.17 in full-year 21 giving Yelp a forward P/E closer to 18. While this may appear good value, I am uncertain about whether Yelp will actually see as sharp of recovery as analysts believe. This would, after all, be a decline of just circa 38% from pre-COVID-19 levels in profitability, even though 100,000+ potential advertising partners will have been lost and other small businesses who do survive will have their spending budgets slashed.Yelp appears to be good value on the face of it, but when looking deeper, it is clear to see that the company is going to continue to see a huge deceleration in growth going forward. Not only this but the headwinds Yelp faces aren't temporary and will have lasting effects on the crux of their business, the small businesses. They are Yelp's customers essentially, not those who provide reviews. The previous niche of Yelp is becoming lost as small businesses have been hit the hardest. For these reasons, I do not believe Yelp is worth the risk at current prices, even though shares may seem cheap, I believe investors will soon find current prices aren't so much so.If you enjoyed this article, make sure to hit the ""Like"" button, and if you want to see more coverage from me, then click on the ""Follow"" button at the top of the screen."

Even though one could argue that Yelp has a very strong balance sheet, with no debt and a cash position of $530 million, I question whether this is enough to attract new investors to this stock.Moreover, while acknowledging that Yelp is not burning through any cash, we should squarely focus on the fact that its top line is facing significant headwinds.Hence, although the stock trades for just 2x forward sales, I contend that there's still not enough margin of safety in this stock.Yelp connects consumers with local businesses. Yelp sells advertising to local businesses allowing these businesses to gain visibility and be discovered by consumers. In other words, Yelp provides companies with lead generation.Moving on, looking ahead, Yelp's near and medium-term prospects are looking unimpressive.Source: Author's calculationsAside from the big drop in revenue in Q2 2020, readers should note that during 2019 Yelp was not reporting particularly strong growth rates - when the economy was its strongest.However, what is slightly more difficult to notice, but nevertheless noteworthy, is that throughout 2019 Yelp's revenue growth rates were accelerating throughout 2019, even if its growth rates were somewhat bumpy.Yet, frustratingly, COVID crushed Yelp's business model, which culminated with Q2 2020 reporting horribly negative growth rates of negative 32% y/y.Having said that, it's not all bad, because Yelp's management was nimble enough that through a steadfast reduction in operating costs, Yelp succeeded in cutting back $71 million out of its operations.Yelp's swift action in the face of its falling revenues allowed Yelp to finish Q2 2020 with an adjusted EBITDA of $11 million.Furthermore, Yelp's adjusted EBITDA of $11 million translated into approximately $17 million of cash flows from operations - thus, a very strong cash conversion during Q2.In summary, even though Yelp's top line looks grim, founder and CEO Jeremy Stoppelman and his team deterministically took the required action to bolster Yelp's operations. But I question whether this is enough.Source: Q2 2020 Investors' PresentationI've circled in red two verticals that Yelp serves. As readers know, Hotels and Restaurants are two markets that Yelp serves which are going to be under pressure for some time.Even when Hotels and Restaurants see their business returning to normal strength, the ability of Yelp to gain meaningful traction once more will be challenging because Alphabet's (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google is determined to push out Yelp.In other words, Yelp was already struggling to get traction because of COVID, but once the environment starts to improve, it will have to once more battle with Google as Google resumes its own mission in attempting to gain market share in the reviews market.It could be said that Yelp has coexisted with Google for a long time, and that is nothing new? On the surface, this is true. However, in reality, Google continues to rapidly expand its content of ratings, reviews, photos, making it increasingly challenging for Yelp to compete.Looking back, at the time of my previous article, I was bullish Yelp's prospects and went long. But on the back of Yelp's Q2 results, I had to do an about-turn and acknowledge that Yelp was facing too much of an uphill struggle.The issue for shareholders is to find a compelling enough reason to remain long. Because it's difficult to know just how long Yelp's operations will remain subdued.What we do know is that until the economy is fully reopened, Yelp's prospects are not likely to return to positive growth.And looking forward to next year, when Yelp starts to lap its Q2 2020 results, investors are unlikely to reward the stock with a meaningfully larger multiple until there's ample evidence that Yelp has what it takes to be a relevant business which adds value to both consumers and companies.Accordingly, looking ahead over the next few quarters, Yelp's prospects are not looking particularly healthy:Source: SA Premium ToolsHowever, given that Yelp's balance sheet is so strong, with no debt and a cash position of slightly over $520 million, this implies that approximately 30% of its market cap is made up of cash.On the one hand, reasons to be bullish Yelp include the fact that it has a very strong balance sheet and it's not burning through any cash.Also, the fact that it's priced at close to 2x forward revenues reinforces the narrative that the stock is in no way expensive.However, until Yelp positively demonstrates that it can not only stabilize its top line but provide substantial evidence that it offers its customers and consumers enough value, this business is more likely than not to just tick along, and not provide its shareholders with enough upside potential to compensate them for being investing in a public company. There are better opportunities elsewhere."
4369737,103480,2020-08-19T13:54:36-04:00,"Shares of Yelp have cratered ~15% after the company reported second-quarter results.Yelp's -32% y/y revenue decline was disappointing, but it was largely expected and did beat consensus numbers.Unlike many other internet advertising/social media companies, Yelp didn't have the benefit of surging volumes to make up for pricing declines.Still, the fact that Yelp is cutting costs in an attempt to boost profitability makes it a solid long-term play.","It's been a tough year for Yelp (YELP), the local business reviews site that many people turn to for restaurant recommendations. The coronavirus lockdowns have shuttered a large swath of Yelp's paying advertisers, and with many restaurants still operating in limited fashion or not at all, Yelp has also seen a decline in site traffic. Adding insult to injury is the fact that all year long, advertisers in general have pulled back on their marketing budgets, weighing on ad pricing.Ad revenue is a function of price times volume. Across the internet sector, many companies (like social media stocks) have been able to balance a ~15-20% decline in the price of ads against a massive boost in traffic. Yelp, however, is being needled by both a decline in pricing as well as a decline in traffic. So unsurprisingly, the company has been one of the few internet stocks not to see handsome gains this year; in fact, shares of Yelp are down more than 30% in the year to date.Data by YChartsBeaten-down, contrarian stocks, however, often carry a great deal of opportunity. It's true that Yelp is not in the ideal macro environment, but there are several points of strength that investors should be aware of:I continue to view Yelp as capable of returning to its historical EBITDA levels - if not by next year, then by the following year. To me, even if adjusted EBITDA dollars don't normalize back to 2019 levels in 2021, margins are highly likely to thanks to Yelp's cost cuts. So if we look at consensus' $931.2 million revenue target for Yelp in FY21 (+11% y/y, but -8% vs. FY19) and apply Yelp's FY19 adjusted EBITDA margin of 21% to it, we arrive at an FY21 estimated Adjusted EBITDA of $196.8 million. At present share prices near $23, meanwhile, Yelp trades at a market cap of $1.67 billion, and after netting off the $525.7 million of cash on Yelp's balance sheet (and zero debt, which is another reason to like Yelp), its enterprise value is only $1.14 billion. That's just a 5.8x EV/FY21 Adj. EBITDA multiple (or 5.3x FY19 Adj. EBITDA), which I think over-penalizes a company that has the dominant traffic position in restaurant and local business reviews.Use the dip to scoop up a position at a low entry point.Let's now dig a little deeper into Yelp's second-quarter results. The earnings summary is shown below:Figure 1. Yelp Q2 resultsSource: Yelp Q2 earnings releaseYelp's revenue declined -32% y/y to $169.0 million, declining rapidly versus +6% y/y growth in Q1 (and a -5% y/y decline in March), but substantially beating Wall Street's estimates of $152.6 million or -38% y/y. As previously mentioned, Yelp's advertising intake is a function of price times volume, and while the recovery on ad pricing is rather ambiguous across the internet sector (with companies reporting mixed messages), we can definitely say that Yelp's traffic at the very least is seeing an uptrend - and some of the June recovery that Yelp has seen may be responsible for the six-point beat to analyst consensus in Q2.The slightly frustrating fact is that Yelp has been very ambiguous when it comes to discussing traffic trends or guidance. The chart below shows rolling 7-day page views and searches surging from April/May lows into June, though no units are attached to the chart:Figure 2. Yelp traffic trendsSource: Yelp Q2 shareholder letterDirectionally, however, Yelp continues to give bullish feedback on the pace of its recovery. A couple of the key qualitative highlights that deserve a mention:The only cautious commentary was the fact that traffic may have plateaued in July as lockdowns recommenced. Per CFO David Schwarzbach's prepared remarks on the Q2 earnings call:In response to uncertainty, Yelp has responded on the cost side. Operating expenses fell by $71 million in Q2 relative to Q1, which still allowed Yelp to crank out positive Adjusted EBITDA of $11.1 million despite the sharp revenue drop:Figure 3. Yelp EBITDA trendsSource: Yelp Q2 earnings releaseThe company noted that ~$30 million of expenses would revert back in Q3 as furloughed employees come back, or roughly half of its ~$70 million in cost reductions. The company has suggested, however, that overall headcount will not be returning to pre-pandemic levels even after these furloughed employees return, and you can see below that at the end of Q2 sales headcount was about ~50% lower than pre-pandemic while overall headcount was about ~35% lower.Figure 4. Yelp headcount trends Source: Yelp Q2 shareholder letterLast quarter, Yelp noted that it was laying off and furloughing a roughly equal amount of employees (which is substantiated by its comment that $30 million of its $70 million Q2 cost cuts would revert), which means that we could expect roughly ~$100-$150 million cut out of Yelp's annualized cost base - supporting my earlier assertion that even if revenue remains depressed relatively to FY19 levels through next year, Yelp will at least be able to achieve improvements on Adj. EBITDA through cost cuts.It's clear to see why Yelp is currently an unpopular stock in the market. Much of Yelp hinges on restaurants and businesses being able to open again, like most non-tech stocks in the market. But we are very interested in how Yelp has reacted to the pandemic - taking a hatchet to its costs and improving its self-serve advertising channel are great examples of actions that will make Yelp emerge from the pandemic stronger. In my view, Yelp can net great gains for the patient investor."
4368300,105582,2020-08-13T09:45:00-04:00,Cancelled contracts were not reflected in Q1 so the worse is likely to come.Yelp has free cash flow but in my view it is not a good proxy of shareholder value.Yelp's value proposition is likely to decrease due to Covid-19.The best way to profit is to use options for longer term underperformance versus peers.,"This article was highlighted for PRO subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Yelp is in a bad spot coming out of this shutdown. Prior to the Coronavirus, it had rough relationships with its advertising customers and the current environment only makes it worse. Management takes money out to pay developers yet they never develop anything new. And the worse might be coming during Q2 or Q3 earnings since terminated contracts were likely not reflected in Q1. On top of that, their largest segment of paying customers are small service based businesses which are the ones suffering the most during this pandemic. But at this valuation I can't justify borrowing shares to short since their business model is profitable, they have a decent balance sheet, and a large user base with increasing reviews. Instead I believe the best way to approach Yelp is to capture the future underperformance versus its peers. Yelp provides a mobile application and website which allows its users to post reviews on businesses from restaurants to handyman services. Yelp monitors these reviews heavily and often takes down fake reviews or paid reviews which makes consumers feel secure. They also verify the business license(s) of companies listed for a fee and offer other services such as reservations or delivery through the application. The company’s main focus is on local businesses and offers the them free and paid advertising. Historically over 90% of their revenue comes from targeted advertising to their users by businesses(also called sponsored listings). Although restaurants have the most reviews and user activity, the majority of ad revenue comes from home & local services.From Yelp's 2019 10-KUsing Yelp to find a great new restaurant is an overall great experience. However, using Yelp as a business owner to promote your services has been much more mixed.Advertising companies tend to be secretive about how much they charge in order to avoid price wars with competitors. Fortunately, people have written about their experience using Yelp online. While there is no guarantee anything is accurate, I think it is a important to understand the structure more than the price.This user claims to have signed a 3-month contract with Yelp for advertising. While the conclusion of his article could be biased, the important thing to focus on is the structure of the contract. Another user gave some color on how Yelp structured the deals and the prices offered to him(see picture below). Source: Raymond FongOverall, there are many mixed opinions about whether you should advertise on Yelp. I went through multiple small business blogs, marketing blogs, and asked people I knew who used Yelp advertising in order to get a better feel for the value proposition. The lack of transparency was mentioned multiple times as the major reason for avoiding the service. Transparency can be subjective, but users claimed that it was harder to learn about their customers and conversion rates in Yelp compared to Google. The best use of Yelp advertising appears to be for new businesses to get their first customers. Once a business has multiple good reviews, there appears to be a diminishing ROI on Yelp advertising. There is no quantifiable evidence any of this and it is important to take it with a grain of salt since most of my research was gathered from a sample.In the past few years Yelp made a significant change that affected the quality of its business model. The company switched from contracts to getting paid month by month in late 2018. They hoped that the low commitment would enable it to attract more business. They briefly attracted more customers but it doesn't appear many of them stayed. I believe small businesses who aren't willing to buy in contracts probably don't have enough capital to pay advertising expenses for months or year. The change from contracts to monthly means that the company can't scale enough to run on negative working capital since they don't have any prepayments. I believe this drastically reduces the quality of Yelp's business. On the surface, Yelp screens extremely cheap on an EV/FCF basis which is how I initially found the idea.Created using data as of 8/01/2020However, a deeper dive in the financials reveal multiple issues. First I'm going to focus on pre-Covid Yelp and then use the first quarter to draw assumptions about its future. Quality of EarningsFrom Yelp 2019 10-KImmediately Yelp's insanely high gross margin stands out. They have consistently been greater than 90% and it's 10-Yr average is 93%. However their actual operating margin is in the low single digits and was negative until 2016. This due to all the people expenses associated with the business. Margins have been increasing slowly as they scale but unfortunately revenue growth has slowed down significantly so it's unlikely they'll be able to get significant benefits from operating leverage going forward.One other important thing to note is how significant ""other income"" has become as a percentage of net income. ""Other income"" is mostly the interest made investing their cash. I think this is a big sign that Yelp is having trouble reinvesting cash and their ROIC will be low going forward. That has been a trend in the past and very likely in their future. It also makes their net income margin look bigger than it is. Chart from QuickFS as of 8/01/2020Revenue in millions, year over year growth underData from QuickFS as of 8/01/2020Quality of Cash FlowLet's start by taking a look at where cash is coming from. To make things easier, I will group working capital items together which. Later in this section I will briefly cover working capital and the balance sheetCreated using data from 2019 10-KThe first thing to point out is that the vast majority of cash is coming from adding back stock based compensation.Whether this is a good thing because it keeps the employees incentivized or bad thing because it could dilute you depends on your management philosophy. But for my adjusted cash flow I'm going to assume that over time Yelp will buyback equivalent to what they issued in order to avoid diluting shareholders. (Might be too conservative here but better than too aggressive.) Since they will eventually have to pay in cash I will simplify the process and subtract stock based compensation from cash flow.*For further reading on the topic of treating stock based compensation in cash flow valuations I highly suggest this post by a fellow Seeking Alpha contributor as well as this post by NYU Professor Aswath Damodaran.The second thing that should be noticed is that provisions for doubtful accounts makes up 10% of cash flow from operations. This is money that Yelp itself doesn't think it's going to get. If Yelp doesn't think it's going to get it then we shouldn't either(especially in this environment). So I will also be subtracting this in order to adjust the cash flows better.Working Capital has been tricky. As a percentage of revenue it has varied over time and there doesn't appear to be any consistent pattern other than Accounts Receivable growing with revenue. However, they can't run on negative working capital. Yelp has way more cash than they need at the moment and growth will be slow. So I think it's safe to assume their true working capital is ~$200 million and will stay flat due to no significant growth.Now let's take a look at Yelp's most recent quarterly report. The shutdown started in March so only one month of it is reflected in this recent 10-Q but I'm going to use it to draw future assumptions. From Yelp's Q1 10-QProvisions for doubtful accounts have tripled and allowance for doubtful accounts has doubled. I think this a sign of what's to come in the future for Yelp. The reason Yelp didn't get more beat up during the quarter was because revenue actually increased. However, I believe that revenue only increased because most of the contract cancellations were likely done after March. Judging from the way contracts are formed, those who cancelled earlier likely paid an extra month as a cancelation fee which made up for March losses. On top of that many customers had paid for March and probably stopped after their 3-month contract ended from January - March. The big question in the short-term is whether Yelp has been able to increase advertising enough during May and June to beat the revised expectations for this upcoming quarter.I don't have a strong conviction but my opinion is that it's very likely the worst is going to come when they report Q2 or Q3 not Q1. I talk about structuring a short term trade based around those quarters later in this article. Due to my view that Yelp has worsening relationships with its customers and a lack of demand for advertising in the near future, I believe Yelp is going to struggle monetizing their active user base as efficiently as they have in the past. Revenue has slowed down from high double digits to mid single digits over the past decade and I believe it is likely to be in the lower single digits going forward. The focus on increasing revenue through monthly sponsored listings may have worked in the short term but it worsens the business model and makes it more volatile. The ""Home and Local Services"" segment makes up roughly 1/3 of revenue so that's going to be the main focus. These are generally non-franchised small business doing services such as plumbing, gardening, roofing, etc... There is a lot of conflicting information. People either think that they're going to suffer badly because of the lower economic buying power of their customers or they believe that being at home and having a stimulus check increases the demand for work in roofing, plumbing, and landscape. I don't have a strong opinion on either. Ultimately, I don't think a surge in home and local service business activity leads to an increase in Yelp advertising. With the way the economy is turning, I would bet that small business are cutting back on non-necessary spending.Using the following assumptions we can get a rough idea of how much we should pay for Yelp:Yelp isn't a high flying tech company anymore. It has been profitable over the past five years and its growth has slowed down tremendously. The current environment is only going to slow them down even more which is why I believe a 3%-5% top line growth is likely. Like I previously mentioned, Yelp is maturing as a business and the margins have stayed roughly the same over the past three years. Therefore I think it's best to use a discounted cash flow valuation. I went over my working capital assumptions earlier in the article and I am using historical Capex. As you can see below, the value per share given the assumptions used is ~$18.Created using adjusted cash flow and data from 2019 10-KThere's a lot of moving parts built into what drives Yelp's business performance. Obviously the Coronavirus is a big issue but they had slowing growth and a increasing competition before. Ultimately, I think the market is too optimistic on this one from a valuation perspective. So here are a few trade ideas using options.Q2 & Q3- Naked PutShort Yelp , Long ConsumerSynthetic ShortYelp is sailing against the wind. However, much of it seems to be priced in already. Unless they become more transparent in the price and conversion of their sponsored listings, I don't think they'll be able to gain market share from Google. From a shareholder perspective, management hasn't done enough to return value to and they are aggressive in their accounting. But they still have a loyal user base and a decent balance sheet so it's hard to bet on the company going to zero. All that is why I would recommend an options trade using puts on Yelp and calls on a consumer sector ETF."
4369252,22521,2020-08-17T14:31:32-04:00,A potential acquisition target for both strategic and financial acquirers.Yelp could shrink the equity base by 20%.A vaccine (in the Fall) should drive the stock back to pre-COVID-19 levels.Overall COVID-19 cases are declining and New York and New Jersey are looking to open for indoor dinning soon.Two of the most prominent investment firms are recommending that investors buy the Shares.,"Yelp’s shares have come under significant pressure since reporting an upside quarter on revenue and EBITDA. However, two comments from management drew investor concerns and led to an 18% share price correction the following day: (1) Yelp’s comment that traffic had plateaued in July; and (2) additional $30 million in costs as furloughed employees are returned and employee salaries are returned to 100%. Granted, management could have done a better job on the messaging, but we believe the selloff was an overreaction. Several firms increased their price targets on the shares, with one notable and well respected Analyst pushing his price target to $29. Fair enough, but there are several reasons why investors should start buying the shares upon pullback:1) Yelp is an attractive acquisition candidate to both strategic and financial acquirers – Could get taken out at $36, ~60% upside. Yelp has been the subject of constant acquisition interest and rumors for several years. Per the Wall Street Journal, in 2015, Yelp once hired bankers to explore a sale (link) but for unknown reasons the process did not end in a sale. In September of last year, rumors circulated around the investment community, and reported by the Wall Street Journal (link,) that Groupon (GRPN) approached Yelp about an acquisition. Unclear what happened but with the resurgence of Interest by investors in Groupon’s shares, could be they revisit their interest in Yelp. Also, in early 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that Yelp hired Evercore (link) for activist defense after hedge fund calls for potential sale of the company and a board overhaul.Yelp would make an attractive acquisition because it has massive traffic coming directly to the website/app, it has high brand awareness, and it has content that is unmatched elsewhere, reviews. Yelp has 214 million reviews of businesses on its platform. No other platform has been successful at replicating that scale of reviews. And in 1Q20, prior to the heavy onset of COVID-19, Yelp had nearly 63 million mobile unique visitors to the website.Yelp currently trades at 8x 2021 consensuses EBITDA vs an average of 12x over the past five years. The peer group of SMID Internet companies trade at 20x 2021 EBITDA. It is reasonable to expect that Yelp can capture a premium to its average multiple. A 15x multiple to 2021 EBITDA would value Yelp at $36 per-share, or upside of 60%.Interested parties could be Groupon, IAC (IAC), Google (GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Apple (AAPL) and eBay (EBAY). $36 per-share would imply an enterprise value of just $2.1 billion, which is a rounding error on the balance sheets of Google, Facebook, and Apple.IAC is interesting here because it is flushed with $4 billion of cash from the spin-off of Match Group (MTCH) and it is going shopping. The company recently invested $1 billion in MGM on the public markets so it has $3 billion left plus a nice stock price as currency. ANGI Homeservices (ANGI), which IAC controls, just raised $500M in debt. We have no idea if IAC is looking at Yelp but since they are looking, I would assume Yelp is on the radar given the synergy potential with ANGI. Watch this one!Private equity would also be interested. Yelp generated $167 million in free cash flow in 2019. Consensus is estimating $110 million in free cash flow in 2021 and $140 million in 2022. Yelp has zero debt and $526 million in cash. A financial acquirer could lever the balance sheet to 5x or $700 million at cheap interest rates and pay down the debt with cashflows overtime. An exit back to the public markets in two years when Yelp has fully recovered from COVID-19, or a sale to one of the above companies makes for an attractive return.2) Share repurchases – Could shrink equity by 20%. Yelp ended 2Q20 with $526 million in cash and zero debt. That is roughly 30% of the market capitalization. Insane, and Yelp has nothing to do with the cash except return it to shareholders, in our opinion. By our estimates, Yelp just needs $200 million in cash on the balance sheet at all times. They should generate another $40 million in free cash flow in the second half of this year and another $110 million next year. Yelp could repurchase $300 million worth of shares and shrink the equity by 20%. 3) A vaccine could drive the shares back to previous Pre-COVID-19 highs. There are now nine major pharmaceutical companies working on a vaccine for COVID-19 (link) and a bevy of Biotechnology companies chasing a vaccine as well. Russia just announced that they have actually produced a vaccine. The World Health Organization (WHO) put a “DRAFT landscape of COVID-19 candidate vaccines” (link) which list 29 candidate vaccines in clinical evaluation, as of August 13. Six firms, including University of Oxford, Sinovac, Wuhan Institute of Biological Products/Sinopharm, Beijing Institute of Biological Products/Sinopharm, Moderna/NIAID, and BioNTech/Fosun Pharma/Pfizer are already in Phase 3 clinical trials.With this amount of intellectual and financial capital chasing a vaccine, there is a great chance we are likely to have a major announcement in the coming months. A vaccine is needed to make people fully comfortable to go back inside restaurants and bars, although we suspect some people will go back to indoor dining where it is allowed without a vaccine.Most investment firms are calling for the FDA approval of at least one vaccine by the end of this year and expect wide distribution by governments across the world. An article by Barron’s noted that Trump does have the power to get the FDA to fast track a vaccine. If that is the case, consumer spending would accelerate in 2021 as normal day-to-day activities resume. Consumers would rush to restaurants, bars, and nightclubs and to Yelp to read reviews, make appointments, and search for places to go. Investors could benefit by buying into the stock ahead of the vaccine announcement.4) COVID-19 cases are declining; New York & New Jersey are looking to open for indoor dinning soon. Ahead of any potential approval of a vaccine by the FDA, COVID-19 cases in the U.S. are declining after peaking in mid-July. And that is with testing reaching a high of close to 900,000 per-day. This downplays the theory that declining cases are the result of less testing. In particular, Florida and Texas, two hard-hit states in the Sunbelt are seeing noticeable declines in COVID-19 cases after the resurgence in June. NYC, the hardest affected region, is now looking to reopen gyms. New Jersey, the second hardest hit state, just announced that they are looking to open for indoor dining soon. From the New Jersey governor - ""sooner than later"" and ""I hope that we will. I almost can say that I expect that we will"", “we are trying to find a way to get to indoor dining and get gyms open."" These are positive signs that we are recovering from COVID-19, albeit at a very slow pace, but moving past it nonetheless. And even if there is resurgence with the onset of flu season, we are hopeful that a vaccine breakthrough will be announced by then, given several companies in Phase 3 clinical trials.5) Two prominent investment firms are recommending purchase of the shares with one seeing 49% upside. Yelp has been a cult stock for many years and there were very few, if any, Sell ratings on the shares. But lately, Analysts appeared to have given up on the stock. Only four of the 22 brokerage houses are recommending the shares, with 14 rating the shares a Hold, and four saying sell the shares. However, two very prominent brokerages, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse, are recommending purchase of the shares, with $28 (+23% upside), and $34 (+49% upside) price targets, respectively. Both Analysts are highly respected by Investors. In addition, as we noted earlier, Mark Mahaney of RBC, one of the top Analysts as measured by Institutional Investor for several years in a row, raised his price target on Yelp to $29 following 2Q20 results.6) Lastly, Home & Local Services is benefiting from COVID-19. Like with companies such as ETSY (ETSY), Amazon (AMZN), Cimpress (CMPR), and ANGI Home Services, Yelp’s Home & Local Services Category have benefited from the accelerated shift to online that appears permanent. The category is now near 50% of revenue, up from 30% two years ago, and declined just 6% in the quarter, with the Home piece growing YoY. That compares to a 60% decline in revenue at the Restaurants category. The category should continue to grow strongly while the other categories (Restaurants, Beauty & Fitness, Shopping) recover with the improving of COVID-19 conditions. So we are likely to see a much better revenue growth profile for Yelp on the other side of COVID-19, particularly as we get a vaccine. That should lead to several upgrades of the stock by brokerages.In summary, with the above reasons and potential catalysts, we believe Yelp’s shares are attractive at present levels and we have bought on the pullback.Risks include: (1) COVID-19 cases and deaths could surge again during the upcoming flu season. If so, small businesses would again close and many more could be forced out of business; (2) Yelp could face increased competition from Google in reviews or get deeper with connecting with small local businesses; (3) Yelp has a high dependence on traffic from Google. Google could enact changes in its algorithm that could hurt Yelp's traffic; (4) Yelp could decide to ramp up expenses higher than investors are expecting."
4366904,22148,2020-08-09T19:58:18-04:00,"Yelp easily beat Q2 analysts estimates.
        The company still sees business down 25% from previous levels.
        The stock trades at an absurdly low 1.3x EV/S multiple offering deep value.","Investors didn't react kindly to the Q2 results from Yelp (YELP), but the numbers weren't very devastating. The consumer review site has the cash to survive until business normalizes and the financials to not suffer during the virus shutdown. My bullish investment thesis wants investors to understand the clear opportunity here as the economy normalizes and people learn how to operate under virus restrictions. Image Source: Yelp website With a lot of the major cities in the U.S. shutdown mid-April, Yelp appeared set to report some very devastating numbers. Some questions even existed on whether the company had enough cash for the downturn. The Q2 results show a company skating through a period with traffic down 50% at one point with no material damage. Sure Yelp has seen lower revenues, but the company still generated positive EBITDA in the quarter. Even the cash balance is up to $526 million. In total, revenues declined 32% to $162 million while EBITDA dipped to only $11 million. These numbers just weren't horrible with revenues actually beating analyst estimates by over $16 million. Yes, key app unique devices were down 23% to only 28 million while paying advertising locations dipped 31%. Both of these numbers are short term issues sure to resolve with a return of either new advertisers or old locations when the economy improves. The key is that cumulative reviews surged 12% to 214 million. The more reviews, the more long-term value. Source: Yelp Q2'20 shareholder letterSo Yelp endured the worst possible economic scenario for a company reliant on consumers exploring the world for places to dine or visit. Consumers stuck at home don't need Yelp. The company stands here in early August with revenues around June levels down 25% due to the virus slowing down the rebound because of the re-surging cases. At the same time, Yelp plans to increase operating expenses by ~$30 million in Q3 to bring employees back off furlough and restore work hours.The consumer review site needs to invest in the business for long-term growth. The current signs on the virus show the start of the burnout process that would allow Yelp revenues to rebound the rest of the quarter. A lot clearly depends on where the virus cases go from here. In addition, how governments and citizens handle a resurgence in cases considering lower negative outcomes now and a better understanding of the reality of fewer infections in August than during the peak back in March will determine how Yelp does in the short term. A case can definitely be made that a lot of previous paying advertisers won't reopen. Thousands of restaurants and small businesses won't survive the economy downturn impacting places that previously advertised on Yelp. Ultimately though, business will return and new restaurants will open where other places closed. Consumers will turn to Yelp to find which restaurant is still open and advertisers will spend to attract those users. The stock only has an enterprise value of $1.0 billion so one only has to take a look at the $169 million Q2 revenues to start contouring up some deep value. Analysts previously had Yelp reaching 2021 sales of $1.2 billion while the estimate has dipped to only $916 million now.The big $16 million Q2 revenue beat and the fact June was only down 25% supports a far higher revenue number than analyst estimates. Regardless, the stock at $22 is far too cheap for the business. Yelp now has a 1.3x EV/S multiple in comparisons to Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) up at 5.2x. Yelp has about 72 million shares outstanding and the $526 million cash balance. Assuming business normalizes back at revenues of $1.1 billion in 2021 (still some $100 million below pre-virus estimates), the stock would only trade at a 2x EV/S multiple at $38.The stock essentially traded around this level prior to the virus impact, but investors need to keep in mind this remains a very low EV/S multiple. Double the multiple would be normal for 10% revenue growth. The key investor takeaway is that a lot of uncertainty exist with Yelp and their paying advertisers. Ultimately though, whether from the virus burnout of a vaccine here in a few months, business will normalize closer to 2021 estimates. The stock is far too cheap here with an EV of only $1.0 billion. Investors should use the weakness to load up."
4354465,69905,2020-06-18T08:18:42-04:00,"Revenues in April are down 35% y/y. But this is probably as low as it's going to get. The rest of 2020 should meaningfully improve.Co-founder lead company with meaningful skin in the game, positively aligned with shareholders.This stock is cheap, and its downside is already factored to a meaningful extent.","Yelp (YELP) is directly intertwined with local businesses' economic outlooks. We are told that April will see revenues fall 35% year-over-year.However, looking beyond this, I believe its stock is cheap enough to compensate investors.Indeed, as the economy reopens, Yelp should see its revenue growth rates start to approximately pre-COVID levels set back in January and February, with strong single-digit revenue growth rates. On balance, this free cash flow generating business model is simply quite cheap. This stock is worthwhile considering, here's why:Source: author's calculationsAbove we can see that Yelp has been a stable grower.Even though its revenue growth rates have been decelerating for some time starting back in 2016, Yelp was still nevertheless continued to post growth in the mid-single-digits range.However, more recently, with the local ad market for restaurants and retail weighing on its near-term results in a social distancing environment, investors should brace themselves for a substantially negative revenue growth rate in Q2 2020.In actuality, this has been the prevailing sentiment amongst investors for some time now. The question is just how negative will its results be? And whether that pessimism is already more than sufficiently priced into its share price? And finally, whether there's any light at the other end? I attempt to answer these questions here.Obviously, right now visibility is very poor. However, we do know that anything 'local' requiring a physical presence is going to be challenged. What's more, the focus of investors right now is on seeking out businesses that will thrive in the 'low-touch' economy. Furthermore, looking at analysts' estimates for 2020, we can see there's indeed going to be quite a challenging period for Yelp.Source: SA Premium ToolsHaving said that, while investors move in herds towards very specific industries that are predisposed towards our 'new normal', there are other companies' stocks that are being left being.Is Yelp's business model permanently impaired from work-from-home, or is there any light on the horizon? Before answering that question, let's take a step back first:Presently, in 2020 there is an overabundance of companies which are essentially lead to growth through consistent and meaningful acquisitions. This has been augmented through a combination of low-interest rates and very high stock prices. Thus, when I looked through Yelp's financials I was positively surprised by just how 'clean' its cash flows actually are. Looking back to 2018 and 2019 its EBITDA margins were 19% and 21%, respectively. Specifically, for 2019 its adjusted EBITDA was $213 million, while its actual cash flows from operations were $205 million. When we factor in its capex requirements, its free cash flow came out at $167 million. Thus, we can see that its EBITDA converts into free cash flow at a very high percentage -- 78% conversion rate.Moving on, sometimes the perk that comes from investing in a company that is co-founder lead, is that they often have significant skin in the game -- CEO Jeremy Stoppelman holds 7.8% of the outstanding stock. Thus, Stoppelman's incentives are firmly aligned with those of Yelp's shareholders.Separately, a further weighty consideration includes the fact that Yelp is debt-free with $491 million of cash and equivalents.Yelp doesn't offer any forward guidance. We are told that traffic to its platform is down 50% when compared with pre-COVID levels. Also, management notes that April's revenues year-over-year are down 35%.For now, the bullish thesis will obviously be contingent on the economy reopening, and that Yelp should be able to reignite its growth rates once again.I believe this is sensible. Indeed, we can see that prior to 'shelter-in-place', Yelp's revenues for both January and February were reporting satisfactory growth rates:Source: Stockholders' LetterPut another way, before 'shelter-in-place' Yelp's performance, was nothing to sneer at.Below we can see Yelp's P/Sales multiple:Source: author's calculationsThe reader can observe how with the passage of time, investors' expectation of Yelp continues to compress.In an era when many stock market darlings with poor cash flow profiles are trading at exorbitant multiples, we can see quite the opposite dynamic taking place with Yelp's valuation.Presently, investors are unwilling to pay more than $2 billion market cap for Yelp. This I contend is way too low.We have a company that has a history of actually reporting GAAP profitability and some reasonable revenue growth. Given that its shares are already shorted by 16%, it is difficult to find much more downside for the stock.One of the side effects of COVID for many businesses is that they have been forced to be leaner and meaner. More aggressively run, with less corporate 'fat'.Indeed, Yelp argues in its stockholder letter that it has succeeded throughout April to be as productive in the latter parts of April as compared with the earlier parts of April, despite its headcount reduction. Given Yelp's close links to local companies, with strong exposures to retail and restaurants, we should not expect Yelp to be able to rapidly reignite its revenue growth trajectory any time soon. However, I do believe that its valuation is already sufficiently depressed and factors in that narrative already. This investment could be worth considering."
4333961,103480,2020-03-24T15:41:04-04:00,"Yelp has been one of the hardest-hit tech stocks in the current bear market, down 41% year-to-date and more than 50% from all-time highs.The company recently withdrew its outlook for FY20, citing extreme uncertainties relating to the coronavirus.Yelp's advertising-based business is less-recurring than other tech companies, and the fallout from the coronavirus may have long-term impacts on its business.Not only is site traffic down currently, but many of Yelp's advertisers may go out of business or cut back on ad spending once the current lockdown state ends.","We all know that the effects of the coronavirus on the economy will mostly be temporary on a macro scale, but certain industries - including travel, hospitality, and food - will be impacted for much, much longer. Investors who are piling into the tech sector as a relatively impervious sector should be careful of those companies who primarily deal with these consumer-oriented verticals, including Yelp (YELP).Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, I was a huge Yelp bull. The key bullish thesis for this stock rests on stable low-teens revenue growth, consistently improving EBITDA margins, dominant mindshare in the restaurant space among U.S. diners, and a dirt-cheap valuation.Now, however, the current economic state has upended most of my bullish catalysts on Yelp. The market has taken a very cautious stance on the stock, sending it down ~40% year-to-date (eclipsing ~30% losses in the broader market):Data by YChartsAt present, there are several counterbalancing factors for Yelp. On the negative side, huge coronavirus uncertainty has forced the company to withdraw its outlook for the year, which may throw a wrench into the brisk turnaround that Yelp has been executing toward for the past several quarters. We just don't know how long the current state of shutdown across the U.S. will last.We're concerned primarily about Yelp's underlying customer base - the small businesses and restaurants that make up a good chunk of Yelp's revenues, that may not make it through the current downturn or else drastically reduce their ad spending on platforms like Yelp in order to meet payroll and rent costs. Prior to the coronavirus, Yelp had seemed to stabilize its revenue growth in the low teens, and was doing a good job at greatly improving its operating margins and driving cash flow growth. With a huge question mark over its entire business, however, we believe it's more than likely that Yelp will lose some of its profitability gains over the last year, and not just in the short term.But on the bright side, Yelp is well capitalized - rich in cash, and zero debt. The company has been on a fierce cost-cutting binge over the past several quarters (for example, by moving more of its sales force outside of expensive locales like its SF headquarters and into cheaper, middle America sales markets - a move that is expected to save the company about $10 million annually, or about 1% of its annual revenue). Hopefully this ethos continues into the recession that we're currently in, and that Yelp can preserve as much of its strong balance sheet as possible.With all the new negative indicators pointed against Yelp at the moment, however, I'm reversing my bullish call on the company to neutral. Don't be tempted to catch the falling knife and buy Yelp now - its cheap valuation is no longer relevant when trying to guess at the company's performance for the year is like throwing darts.Of course, the primary catalyst that has pushed shares of Yelp down over the past month is the sheer uncertainty of the coronavirus' impact on the company. As most investors know, Yelp is a classic internet business that generates the lion's share of its revenues from advertising. Though Yelp encompasses a wide variety of small businesses and service providers on its platform, its flagship category is restaurants. And who's paying for advertising when nobody is going out to eat?Amid this uncertainty, Yelp withdrew its guidance for 2020. Previously, on the company's Q4 earnings release, the company had forecast net revenue growth of 10-12% y/y (actually implying an acceleration at the midpoint versus 10.2% y/y growth in FY19), as well as 1-2 points of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement. Yelp cited the following factors as huge uncertainties that caused the company to withdraw its guidance:Figure 1. Yelp guidance withdrawal noteSource: Yelp press centerIn a statement accompanying the press release, CEO Jeremy Stoppelman wrote as follows:Uncertainty for Yelp runs on both ends: both on the advertiser side and on the consumer side.Going further into what Yelp summarized in its press release, on the advertiser side, we know that the current lockdown situation in the U.S. and across the globe has forced most non-chain restaurants into a precarious position. Governors in many states have enforced stay-at-home policies, demolishing restaurant traffic and leaving restaurant owners wondering how they will take care of rent and payroll. Though Yelp has made moves in recent quarters to shift more of its sales focus to enterprise customers (which it calls ""multi-location"" customers), its core stable of advertisers still revolves around small, local-owned businesses.Unlike the many software businesses that I favor in the tech sector, Yelp is not a recurring-revenue subscription businesses, which are the ultimate hedge against a prolonged shutdown scenario. Every sale Yelp makes is new, and due to its concentration to SMBs, Yelp is incredibly vulnerable to churn. Many of its advertisers may go out of business during this difficult time, and if not, they may choose to cut back on advertising spending even after the lockdowns lift in order to defray costs.We also have to worry about consumers. Obviously, very few people (if any) are going out to eat right now, but what about after the lockdown lifts? At present, search traffic for Yelp has diminished drastically over the past year. While Yelp hasn't released any user figures, we do have access to public search data. Take a look at the search term ""Yelp"" on Google Trends, and you'll see that interest has declined ~70% on an indexed basis versus a year ago, with an obvious sharp downturn in February.(As a side note: this is a fantastic way to research what companies are winning in the stay-at-home economy. For example, Google Trends indicates that interest in Disney+ (DIS) and Grubhub (GRUB) have surged since the lockdowns began, for obvious reasons).Figure 2. Google Trends search for ""Yelp""Source: Google TrendsOur concern is that these low search/traffic trends will persist even when the economy begins to normalize. Once Yelp has been ""out of mind"" for awhile, it'll be difficult for the company to generate the same levels of traffic that it was used to getting, and this may put additional pressure on ad revenues.There is a bright spot here that prevents us from being overly pessimistic on Yelp, however. The company's rigorous focus on profitability has built a strong balance sheet that was primed for an emergency moment such as this one. Take a look at Yelp's balance sheet as of the end of Q4 below:Figure 3. Yelp balance sheetSource: Yelp Q4 earnings release Yelp has $465.4 million of cash and investments on its books, with no debt outside of operating leases. Note as well that in FY19, Yelp generated $167.3 million of free cash flow, up +45% y/y - though of course, as previously noted, the current coronavirus situation puts Yelp's FCF generation potential at risk for the current year. At the very least, however, we know that Yelp's ""baseline"" operating model is capable of generating a 16% FCF margin. Coupled with nearly half a billion dollars in net cash, this should provide Yelp with substantial liquidity to weather the current storm.With all the uncertainties swirling around Yelp, especially advertiser churn and declining consumer traffic, we're cautious of buying Yelp even though it continues to plunge deeper into the bargain bin. Wait for signals of a turnaround in the lockdown situation or evidence that U.S. restaurants are in good shape before diving back in."
4354744,22148,2020-06-19T16:03:06-04:00,Yelp's advertising customers were hit hard by COVID-19 store closures.The consumer review site cut out $70 million in quarterly operating expenses while up to $100 million in annual expenses appear to be permanent cuts due to the layoffs.The stock is cheap with the potential for generating higher EBITDA margins.My '22 EBITDA estimates have Yelp trading at an EV of only 4.3x.,"The economic shutdown from the coronavirus had a huge impact on the businesses that advertise on Yelp (NYSE:YELP). The consumer review site was required to make massive layoffs back in April to realign the business with the new realities that customers in the retail and restaurant space won't reopen some stores. As Yelp looks to restart its business, investors can build on my bullish case on the cash-flow machine with the stock still down $10 from the pre-virus levels.The consumer review site has calculated some dire metrics regarding businesses on the platform. Yelp data shows 143,000 businesses are closed with 35% of them listed as permanent closures. Of those industries hit hardest, restaurants account for 48% of those businesses closed permanently.Source: CNBCYelp has historically obtained a substantial amount of revenues from the restaurant sector. By the end of March, the restaurant sector page views and searches were down 60%. The key Services sector saw a 40% decline.Source: Yelp Q1'20 shareholder letterWhat can't really be captured is whether these closures are being replaced by new restaurants or if other restaurants are capturing sales. Ultimately, consumers will venture out into restaurants and utilize Yelp to find what locations are open now. The service could actually start garnering more demand as all of retail restarts, but the business had to dig out from a big drop in business by early April.Yelp was part of a handful of stocks entering the COVID-19 crisis trading at relatively cheap valuations. The stock traded at a high of above $39, but Yelp regularly traded around 15x forward EPS estimates as a lot of financial websites didn't correctly factor in stock-based compensation expenses into calculations.On the rebound to $25, the stock is only worth $1.8 billion now for a business previously generating over $1 billion in revenues and 21% EBITDA margins. Yelp was headed towards an EBITDA approaching $250 million in 2020.In the process of the crisis, Yelp laid off 1,000 employees and furloughed another 1,100 employees with the forecast of cutting Q2 operating expenses by $70 million in comparison to Q1. The company spent $248 million on operating expenses in Q1 while analysts have the company only hitting sales of $150 million in the current quarter.So at the worse of the downturn, Yelp has revenues declining $100 million sequentially with operating expenses down $70 million, leaving the company only $30 million in the hole on the toughest economic period possibly in history.This is where the stock gets very interesting as the company was already becoming more efficient with growing revenues while cutting sales reps. Somewhere above $100 million in annual expenses appear permanent cuts due to the layoffs while analysts now have 2021 revenues rebounding to $928 million followed by over $1.0 billion in 2022.Data by YChartsYelp still generated $17 million in adjusted EBITDA in Q1 despite the weak revenues caused by states shutting down economy mid-March. When the consumer review site returns to $250 million in quarterly revenues, the opportunity exists to have $30 million to $40 million worth of operating costs stripped from the business to accelerate the path to 30% EBITDA margins.Another way of looking at the financials. Yelp generated $1.0 billion worth of sales in 2019 with an EBITDA of $213 million. The opportunity exists to return to the same revenue level without up to $100 million in operating costs to boost EBITDA to $313 million for a 31% margin.The consumer review site is flooded with cash and spent $481 million on share buybacks last year alone. Yelp even ended Q1 with $491 million in cash on the balance sheet, leaving the enterprise value at only $1.35 billion. The stock only trades at an EV of 4.3x 2022 EBITDA estimates on lower costs.The key investor takeaway is that Yelp now trades with a forward EV/S multiple of 1.5x. The stock has always been dirt cheap at this multiple as the market constantly overlooks the cash-flow machine of the business and overplays the threats from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).The stock is cheap here at $25, and investors should use any weakness due to a second coronavirus wave to load up on Yelp."

For this reason, I have chosen a wonderful stock which might rise in price by more than 50%, as soon as the USA overcomes the coronavirus threat. I am, of course, referring to Yelp Inc. (YELP).Source: Business InsiderThe first thing I like about Yelp Inc. is its great balance sheet. The company carries zero debt in its balance sheet and only $230 million operating lease liabilities. Its liquid assets, cash and short-term investments stand at $487 million; which is sufficient to cover its total liabilities 1.54 times and current liabilities 3.63 times.In 2019, total operating costs were $978 million. This comprises $62 million of COGS, $500 million in sales and marketing expenses, $230 million product development costs and $49 million in depreciation and amortization expenses. All these costs are either variable or non-cash expenses, thus the management can easily cancel this spending temporarily to protect the company's liquidity. Only $136 million of general and administrative costs are (fixed and therefore) essential to the operation of the company. Therefore, even in a worst-case scenario, if the company generates zero revenue and suspends all non-fixed costs, it can cover its fixed costs and current liabilities for more than 3 years.Source: 10-K Annual ReportThis impressive cash buffer gives me confidence that the company can continue to trade for the next 3 years even if it is impacted by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic over that period. I do not believe the coronavirus threat will impact for that long, especially as we have already witnessed lots of encouraging news about the development of vaccines. Moderna (MRNA) has already announced that its vaccine has shown positive results in the early stages of development.Thus, we should not be overly concerned about the company's liquidity and must focus on the long-term growth opportunities it provides.Yelp's revenue consists of 3 main income streams: advertising revenue, transaction-based revenue and non-advertising subscription fees. Its advertising-income represents more than 96% of the company's total revenues. Two main sectors bring Yelp its traffic and income. Over 60% of its page views come from the restaurant sector, although it only brings 15% of its ad revenues. At the same time, the services sector, which represents less than 10% of its traffic, brings more than 50% of revenues. The company emphasizes the importance of the restaurant sector because it is the gateway to engaging with home and local service consumers.Source: Yelp Investor PresentationFor the next few months, we can expect poor performance from Yelp stock. Its clients are predominantly small to medium-sized businesses which will have been massively impacted by the coronavirus crisis. Governments are telling people to stay at home. Many people are frightened and are therefore likely to stay at home even after lockdown rules are relaxed. During these times businesses will begin cutting their non-essential expenses like advertising. A number of these S&M businesses will close their doors permanently, which will also impact Yelp's revenues.Yelp traffic has declined substantially in April 2020 with only 74 million visits. This is 41% lower than the 127 million visits in January of this year. It is worth mentioning that up until January, its traffic was steadily increasing. In other words, it was a fast-growing company up until the beginning of this year.Source: SimilarWebAnother statistic from SimilarWeb indicates that 77% of yelp.com visitors enter the site via search engines. This allows us to use Google Trends to try and predict future visitor numbers.Source: SimilarWebThere has been a 60% decline in the number of “Yelp” searches based on the figures for March and April of this year. However, there has been a recovery of about 30% from the lowest April figures. On the other hand, ""Restaurant"" searches have recovered by more than 60% from April lows. It is a sign that in upcoming months ""Yelp"" searches might experience similar recoveries to those for restaurants.At the same time, ""Home Services"" searches didn't decline at all and are, in fact, at the highest levels of 2020.Source: Google TrendsEven though Google Trends indicate that ""Home services"" searches didn't fall at all, the company reported that its services searches have declined about 40% overall.Source: Shareholder LetterThese statistics concern me as it indicates low correlation among overall US trends and Yelp search trends. We see that “Yelp” searches are declining while overall Google searches are stable. This might indicate a market share loss, as the company is underperforming against its peers in the ""Services"" industry.Our assessment is quite optimistic as Yelp was able to record a 35% revenue CAGR during the last 10-year period. The management was able to maintain a profitable position in a very difficult (digital advertising) industry. Because it is competing with giants like Facebook (FB) and Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) we must appreciate its great achievement. Yelp has managed to accumulate 211 million cumulative reviews and 562,000 paying advertising locations monthly. At the same time, it has more than 5.1 million registered business locations on its platform. These businesses might use Yelp's analytical tools to better target their audience. The company is enhancing its analytical tools to show advertisers how their ads are performing relative to competitors' ads.Yelp is developing new technologies to improve the consumer experience on the platform. For example, Yelp Waitlist enables consumers to check the waiting times at local restaurants and book a table in advance. During 2019, Yelp doubled the number of diners it seated through advanced bookings. Innovations like this have improved Yelp visitor engagement and made it more appealing to advertising clients. The company has had difficulties in fully monetizing these consumer leads and is working hard to address this issue. It is estimated that Yelp only managed to monetize 10% of its consumer leads. With an effective management strategy, the company should be able to dramatically improve its conversion rates in this part of its business.Source: Company PresentationThe company is focused on adding more value to its advertising clients. In 2019, it was able to bring 34% more clicks to businesses at an 18% lower price than in 2018. Yelp ad products are sold (predominantly) on a cost per click basis. This is usually more beneficial for the advertiser than an impression-based pricing model. When you pay per click, you know the person taking action is interested in your business and is more likely to buy or use your services. When a business is charged per impression the client may waste a lot of budget on ignored views. It is also more difficult for a business to evaluate the effectiveness of its paid advertisements.At the same time, the company is increasing the number of its mobile app users. Yelp already has 35 million monthly active mobile app users. I do consider the mobile app a very important part of the business and its future success. There is a danger that a consumer will download the app when they need to use it and then forget about it in the future. However, by using app notifications, possibly alongside SMS and email notifications, Yelp can create brand loyalty and raise brand awareness.Yelp’s business and the restaurant industry are closely interlinked. Perhaps, the industry doesn't have moats as it is too easy to open a restaurant with a small budget. In these difficult times, every restaurant manager wants to attract more customers. Social distancing psychology will certainly decrease the demand for restaurants during this pandemic. However, many restaurants continue to operate in a restricted way such as delivery only, and this may encourage more spending on advertising. I do consider this to be very beneficial for Yelp and believe the company will take full advantage of monetizing the trend.The overall trend also benefits Yelp as digital marketing seizes a market share from traditional marketing operators. According to BIA advisory, digital media is going to grow at 10% CAGR till 2023. It is a huge tailwind as it provides a very good fundamental environment for the company to generate high sales growth.Source: Yelp presentationThe biggest challenge for the company is its strong competitors. Almost every field where Yelp operates has very strong competition. Online searches are undoubtedly dominated by Alphabet, which has a vast scale and easily wins a great number of its clients. Social networks such as Facebook and Twitter (TWTR) pose a big threat to the business as they provide targeted advertising options, coupled with a much more sophisticated database.There are also large providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals, such as TripAdvisor (TRIP). When it comes to a restaurant reservation, Yelp faces huge competition from OpenTable, which is also a very popular platform.So, Yelp needs to continue developing new products and investing large sums of money on marketing to stay ahead in such a competitive environment. In 2019, the company spent almost 50% of its revenue on sales and marketing, while 23% of its revenue was spent on product development. The management announced that it expects to lower S&M spending to 40% of revenues. I suspect that it is possible considering the vast scale of competitors and the vital necessity to spend on marketing.Yelp's business is highly dependent on internet search providers to bring traffic to the Yelp website. However, certain search engines offer services that compete with Yelp's products. If links to the Yelp platform are not displayed prominently, traffic to yelp.com could drop and the business would be considerably damaged.As an investor who is bullish on the stock, I am concerned as my Google search results did not favour Yelp. I have searched ""Restaurant in the USA"" on Google and could find no Yelp results on the first page. Even more concerning, I saw search results from certain Yelp competitors.Source: Google.comThe most important part of calculating valuations is an accurate future earnings assessment. This is a very challenging situation for Yelp as the business doesn't possess considerable moats and its revenues can fluctuate heavily. For that reason, we will need to use rather controversial methods to calculate the intrinsic value.To build a DCF model we will use the 2019 operating cash flow subtracting Capex from it. This results in $170 billion of free cash flow. Using the CAPM model we will have an 11% discount rate, as the beta coefficient is 1.36, the equity risk premium is 7.7% and the risk-free rate stands at 0.7%.Considering 0% growth and expecting the company to remain a going concern for 30 years we will have about $1.48 billion intrinsic value for the company, which is equal to current market valuation. Considering a 2% annual growth opportunity, we have $23 stock price and 15% price appreciation opportunity. We must admit that these scenarios are extremely controversial for the company, as it is operating in an industry with more than 10% CAGR, and was able to generate 16% CAGR over the past 10 years. I am inclined to believe that in the most controversial scenario the company will generate 4-5% annual growth and decrease its discount rate by 100 basis points. My suggested scenario yields a $30-34 price target range.Source: Author's SpreadsheetOur Relative Valuation model indicates a huge undervaluation. The 1st Quartile estimate is $25 which is 20% higher than the current price. We will assume that intrinsic value is the average of the 1st quartile result and the median. This gives our estimated average at $36, with a 75% upside potential.Source: Author's SpreadsheetMy analysis indicates that Yelp possesses enough cash to withstand the coronavirus crisis and continue its expansion in a very rapidly growing industry. The underlying business is generating healthy revenues. This means that after the crisis we would have a stock value fluctuating between $30 and $36, bringing Yelp investors a 50% to 75% capital gain opportunity."

It laid off more than 1,000 employees and dramatically cut executive and board compensation.Even if Yelp generates lower revenue for an extended period of time, it may be able to wring more profitability out of that revenue stream.Shares look reasonably valued at ~5x FY19 Adj. EBITDA.","This article was highlighted for PRO subscribers, Seeking Alpha's service for professional investors. Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.Yelp (YELP), the small business reviews site that has become Americans' go-to spot for checking restaurant ratings, is understandably one of the most-pressured stocks in the tech sector this year so far. Though most tech companies have reported signs of normalization and have seen their stocks actually rise for the year (despite mid single-digit declines for the S&P 50 despite mid single-digit declines for the S&P 500), Yelp remains in crisis-fighting mode, as its business is indelibly tied to the state of the lockdown economy. Shares are still down ~35% for the year, far steeper than most other small-cap stocks.Yet in Yelp's most recent Q1 quarterly earnings, the company not only showed promising results that beat Wall Street's expectations, but also laid out a vision that can show the company surviving and generating decent profits, even amid a depressed revenue stream. It's a good time, in my view, to review the bullish case for this stock.Data by YChartsIn mid-March, I went neutral on Yelp after being a long-time bull (a period during which Yelp shares rose only 10% vs. the S&P 500's 25% recovery). At the time, the pace of the global shutdowns was alarming and unpredictable. Now that we've emerged from May with a clearer picture of when and how the return to normal will happen, however, I continue to believe in Yelp's attractiveness as a value play.In short, investors should think of Yelp's near-term strategy in two ways:In my view, Yelp's moves to reduce costs and boost Adj. EBITDA margins will help to offset extended revenue declines. There's a lot of uncertainty about Yelp's future profitability and the company has been reticent to offer guidance, but at present share prices near $23, Yelp has a market cap of $1.64 billion and an enterprise value of $1.15 billion, which we get to by netting off the $490.7 million of cash and zero debt on Yelp's balance sheet. This represents a valuation of just 5.2x EV/FY19 Adj. EBITDA, based on Yelp's 2019 Adjusted EBITDA of $213.5 million. Now of course, there's a chance Yelp won't be able to hit that same level of Adj. EBITDA in 2020, but in my view Yelp's status as the default consumer website for local business reviews and its efforts to slim down costs will preserve its long-term path to recovery.I'm resuming my long stance on Yelp - investors should keep an eye on price movements in this stock and use any near-term dips to buy.We don't need to mince words here: in the wake of the coronavirus, Yelp's business has been shattered alongside the restaurants, retail stores, and mom-and-pop service providers that provide the bulk of its revenue. Pre-crisis, however, trends were strong. As previously mentioned, Yelp had already been in the process of cutting down its sales headcount and focusing on productivity. Yelp entered 2020 with a Local sales headcount that was 10% leaner. But in spite of that slimmer sales headcount, revenue was growing at a ~10% y/y pace through February, until the coronavirus hit in March.Total revenues of $249.9 million in Q1, however, still grew 6% y/y and beat Wall Street's expectations of $226.4 million (-4% y/y) by a huge ten-point margin. We note that in spite of this beat, Yelp's shares are actually down ~2% since reporting results in early May (while the rest of the market has risen up ~5%).Figure 1. Yelp monthly revenue linearitySource: Yelp Q1 shareholder letterWe note that Yelp's traffic declines don't translate 1:1 to revenue declines. Yelp reported that by the end of March, traffic for Restaurants had declined by 60% and services by 40%, though revenues only sustained a single-digit -5% decline in March.Yet despite the dip in March, Yelp believes that we've seen the worst of the declines in April. The company offered up some interesting data in its most recent shareholder letter, drawing on data from the state of California (Yelp's largest market). Yelp noted that web traffic has bottomed out at ""approximately 50% of pre-pandemic levels"", while budgets for Yelp's Services advertisers also stabilized in April at ~25% of pre-crisis levels, as shown in the chart below (no Y-axis units provided; but the line chart gives a good idea of how trends flatlined in April).Figure 2. Yelp California services trendsSource: Yelp Q1 shareholder letterIn my view, drawing on the limited data set we have so far, this means that we've likely seen the worst for Yelp. March's ~50% traffic decline translated to a ~5% drop in revenues, and trends didn't seem to get any worse in April. Wall Street's consensus expectations for FY20 of $820.5 million, meanwhile, calls for a -9% y/y decline in revenue - which in my view is highly pessimistic given the March data, and doesn't imply any recovery in the back half of 2020. Wall Street believes Yelp will return to pre-pandemic revenue levels in FY21, where consensus is calling for $929.3 million in revenue (vs. $895.1 million in FY19).The other element of the picture is Yelp's cost-cutting plan. The page below, taken from Yelp's recent shareholder letter helps to summarize Yelp's major cost reduction efforts:Figure 3. Yelp cost cutting plansSource: Yelp Q1 shareholder letterThe key note here: versus the Q1 that we just passed, Yelp intends to bring down Q2 opex by $70 million, or roughly ~25% of Q1's GAAP operating costs of $277 million. It's important to note that as of now, we don't have any line-of-sight into how these cost savings will annualize. We can't just take $70 million in multiply by four quarters to arrive at annualized savings, because Yelp intends to bring back its furloughed employees.Let's do some back-of-napkin estimations, though. Yelp is laying off and furloughing a roughly equal amount of employees, (1k and 1.1k, respectively). We can then approximately say that $35 million of costs have been permanently removed (laid off) from Yelp's cost structure, while the remaining $35 million will come back once furloughs are ended. A sense check here: $35 million in permanent cost reductions for a headcount reduction of 1,000 means about $35k saved per head per quarter, or ~$140k per year (which is roughly reasonable for total comp and benefits for a typical San Francisco Bay Area employee, where Yelp is presently headquartered).(A side note for completion's sake: while exec comp cuts look nice on paper, the actual total cost impact is likely small. The majority of the board is paid in stock and not cash, while Jeremy Stoppelman was already only making $1 in base salary and the other five named executive officers listed in Yelp's 10-K, page 19 made between $315k-$350k in annual base salary, so a 30% cut will save less than half a million dollars).What does this mean for investors? Well, even if we assume Yelp's revenue is down by ~10% this year (roughly $80 million), the company has enacted ~$35 million in quarterly expense reductions, or ~$140 million annualized. The key message here: even if Yelp's revenue shrinks, it will still be in a good position in Q2 and beyond to generate adjusted EBITDA growth.The underlying message for investors is quite simple: Yelp's revenue trends probably aren't as bad as investors initially feared, and the company has offered reassuring data that both traffic and revenue bottomed in March/April before hopefully recovering in May as the U.S. economy begins to re-open. Meanwhile, the company's layoffs that will likely save ~$140 million in estimated annual costs (representing 16% of FY19 revenues and 14% of FY19 expenses) and may even put Yelp in a position to grow adjusted EBITDA in spite of revenue declines.Now that the country's pace of re-openings is more clear, with Yelp trading at just 5.2x FY19 Adj. EBITDA (vs. pre-crisis multiples around ~9x), I'd say this stock's risk-reward profile heavily favors bulls."
4356652,105697,2020-07-01T18:41:32-04:00,"Yelp has been hit hard by the drop in consumer interest in its key categories caused by the current crisis.Its key categories target discretionary spend which will likely be slower to come back.Many of its target customers, restaurants, gyms and clubs are closed and a lot may not reopen.At 40x P/E (based on historic earnings) this is one to stay away from at present.","Shares in Yelp (YELP) have started to slowly recover following the initial drop from February into March. This is mainly related to sentiment improvements across the broader market and the re-opening of the US with more restaurants and shops starting to reopen. I believe that even with a strong US economic recovery, Yelp still remains far too pricey.Source: Yelp.comSome of the businesses that have been hit hardest by this crisis are smaller businesses. Having to close for even a short period is hugely detrimental but closing for months can put smaller businesses near breaking point. Much of Yelp's focus is towards these smaller companies, many of which may not see the same customer demand that was seen prior to the crisis.The majority of Yelp's most prominent categories dropped sharply back in March. Consumer interest in restaurants dropped 64%, interest in gyms dropped 73% and interest in nightlife, which was one of Yelp's top contributing categories, fell 81%. In response, Yelp laid off 1,000 of its workers, furloughed 1,100 more and implemented pay cuts of 20% to 30% for its executives. At the same time they offered 68,000 square feet of space in their offices for sublease. The company felt the need to act fast as their core business model was hit hard by the crisis.Consumer interest in nightlife will not be a quick recovery and nightclubs and other entertainment venues catering to crowds may be the last things to open after this crisis. Demand in the broader market for advertising, which is 98% of Yelp's revenue in 2019 (all of which is local ads), will likely continue to lag over the medium term. Smaller businesses with tighter pockets and reduced income will likely opt not to use advertising but rather focus on cost control and steadying the ship before they spend advertising dollars to expand sales.Consumer confidence and consumer spending more broadly will still be an issue going forward for Yelp, as their whole business model is driven by consumer demand. In reality, they need this demand to return as quickly as possible as the US starts to reopen. This is a company that needs a 'V shaped recovery' to justify its valuation. But even with a sharp economic recovery, recovery of consumer spending in Yelp's key categories which are focused on discretionary spend such as restaurants and nightlife may be slow to return as customers remain concerned about COVID-19 risks.Yelp has long been 'review focused' rather than 'small business focused'. This has previously aggravated a large amount of smaller businesses who feel that Yelp needs to provide greater aid in supporting them - after all the future of many of these lies in the reviews that are left on Yelp. All it simply takes is a google search surrounding small businesses and Yelp to find a stream of articles discussing smaller businesses' hate for Yelp. Recent auto-fundraisers have also led to continued frustration from business owners on Yelp, adding fuel to the fire. Poor relationships between Yelp and its partners may cause restaurants to opt not to use the local advertising that Yelp has to offer going forward. Although Yelp hasn't really had great issues with this so far, it may be an issue over the long term. Poor relationships certainly aren't beneficial for Yelp.In Yelp's June 2020 local economic impact report, the company found that 140,000 businesses listed on Yelp remain closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. And of all the business closures since March 1st, 41% of them have closed permanently. I don't believe the market has truly priced the severity of these statistics, they have proved the large impact that virus has had on small businesses and the continued drag this will continue to have going forward.Yelp released their first quarter results to March 31 which included a period of disruption in relation to the crisis. The company boasted the fact that revenue had still increased through a turbulent period, but the company did fall to a loss in the first quarter of 2020. The company continues to spend heavily on marketing as spend on sales and marketing hiked around 10% in the first three months of 2020, while revenue increased just 5%. Overall costs and expenses increased heavily in the first quarter, up 15% to $277 million. The board of Yelp has now proposed to lower marketing spend to 40% of revenues, although this would seemingly increase profitability, I don't see it as beneficial when considering the fact that Yelp is trading in an increasingly competitive market. With this cut Yelp may actually struggle to grow revenue going forward. And if Yelp is cutting advertising dollars through this crisis, would it be a surprise if Yelp's target business customers are doing the same?Yelp still trades at a far too pricey valuation, particularly when considering the headwinds that still remain in the broader market. When pricing the current valuation to performance prior to the crisis, Yelp stands on a P/E of more than 40x previous full year earnings. For a company that has had a previously turbulent time in the past two to three years, this is too pricey for my liking. The company has seen net income decline from highs of $150 million back in 2016 to just $40 million in the most recent year. Even though revenue actually grew over that period from $716m in 2016 to $1bn in 2019, I don't believe that Yelp's growth justifies this nor do I believe that the outlook does either, particularly after recently pulling their full year forecasts for 2020, citing coronavirus uncertainty.Yelp's board has previously struggled on conversion of their promises. Back in February 2019 shares popped on the back of a fourth quarter beat of 2 cents but then fell back the same day as analysts started to downgrade the stock. In that Quarterly report the board planned to grow revenue at a ""mid teens"" rate for the next five years:If Yelp were able to achieve this, material value would have been unlocked for shareholders, with a far higher share price. However, they didn't.Overall, in 2019, Yelp reported an increase in revenue of just 7.6%, falling short of their initial bullish and clearly over ambitious targets. Yelp had yet again, put in a bullish forecast for 2020:However, the company has now withdrawn their forecasts citing coronavirus uncertainty. Even if the crisis didn't take hold, the market is clearly not buying into Yelp's bullish predictions and doesn't believe that they can actually deliver on them.I feel that the case for competition towards Yelp isn't considered heavily enough. One of the largest competitors to Yelp is Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) themselves through Google reviews. More and more people are now opting to use Google reviews as they are easily accessible whenever you search a place up. Google reviews currently account for 57.5% of all reviews worldwide, whereas Yelp accounts for just 6.6%. Businesses also prefer the more positive reviews that are seen on Google then Yelp. The average rating for reviews on Google is 4.3, while for Yelp it is 3.65. Google has continued to push themselves ahead of Yelp on searches as Google controls the search results and that will continue to occur into the future. Although people may trust the authority of Yelp more, a continued push towards Google reviews will put pressure on Yelp going forward.Yelp already had a large grudge with Google back in 2014 accusing Google of manipulating results to favor Google reviews rather than quality and what users want to find. Later, in 2017 yelp also accused Google of stealing pictures and content from Yelp's site for their own use. It is fairly obvious that Yelp holds an unhealthy relationship with Google and in 2017 the European Union fined Google $2.7bn for unfairly favoring its services over those of its rivals. Pressure continues to increase on Yelp going forward through competition with Google and also with other competitors such as Tripadvisor, Feefo and Trustpilot. Yelp places a huge amount of responsibility on Google in order to drive traffic and therefore generate its advertising revenues, this may prove more difficult going forward with Google favoring other sites and their own reviews.Yelp has been hit hard by the drop in consumer interest in its key categories caused by the current crisis. The company has acted to cut costs including laying off 1,000 staff and trying to sub-lease office space. Yelp has also announced cuts in its own advertising budget.Many of its target customers, restaurants, gyms and clubs are closed and a lot may not reopen. More broadly, many of its key categories target discretionary spend which will likely be slower to come back even if a V shaped recovery is on the cards in the US.At 40x P/E (based on historic earnings) this is one to stay away from at present.If you enjoyed this article, make sure to hit the ""Like"" button, and if you want to see more coverage from me, then click on the ""Follow"" button at the top of the screen."

The consumer review site pulled guidance for the quarter all the way back on March 19 and trends aren't improving nearly two weeks later. The stock is down over 50% from recent highs providing a very compelling entry point for a company poised to survive the lockdown. My investment thesis remains very bullish on Yelp at $17.Image Source: Yelp websiteBack in mid-March, Yelp reported a big decline in key local business areas on the site such as the 54% dip in actions related to restaurants. At least, the company has some benefit from restaurants remaining open for takeout and delivery so the site hasn't lost all of its users.The consumer review site has seen a big boost in categories such as guns and fitness equipment. Neither area was particularly large before the coronavirus outbreak, so Yelp is losing big ad spending categories for local businesses not as likely to have previously advertised on the platform.JMP Securities analyst pegged the traffic decline at 50% in March over the February levels. At this rate, Yelp will see similar traffic dips in April and possibly beyond.Clearly, the long-term impact to the Yelp business is highly dependent on how quickly the economic lockdown lasts.Where Yelp ends up trading in the next few months depends on where the business normalizes months following the end of the coronavirus outbreak. The ad business greatly depends on the level of consumer mobility and demand for restaurants and services in the new world.Yelp traffic is highly dependent on consumers exploring the app for new places to eat such as delivery options now or increasingly for at-home service providers in the future. Both functions could be at risk in the new global world of social distancing and restricted consumer mobility.For this reason, JMP cut its 2021 EPS target to $1.86 from $2.90. The consensus estimate has dipped from near the $3.00 level to only $2.30 now.Data by YChartsThe EPS cuts just don't appear logical. By 2021, the world should have developed vaccines and treatments for the coronavirus to eliminate the major healthcare threat. In addition, the limited impact of the virus on healthy people under 65 won't hold the economy and consumer mobility down for much beyond May where warmer weather will naturally restrict the virus spread. Starbucks (SBUX) reopening stores in the Hubei Province about two months after closing the province is a strong indication of how quickly the retail sector can rebound.Where Yelp has a leg up on surviving the economic lockdown is a strong balance sheet. The company had $434 million in cash at the end of December.Down here at $17, the stock has a market cap of $1.2 billion with an enterprise valuation of $800 million. For a company with previous 2021 revenue targets of $1.1 billion and EBITDA margins approaching mid-20%, the stock is an extreme bargain with any concept of consumer mobility returning to normal levels by next year.If Yelp ever approached the previous expectations for a $3 EPS, the stock trades sub 6x EPS estimates. Until then, Yelp only has about $800 million in annual operating expenses (cash costs) so the company can survive a year of revenues at a 50% level without cutting costs.The key investor takeaway is that Yelp is poised to survive the economic lockdown hitting demand for its site. The company has the balance sheet to prepare for the eventual rebound in consumer mobility later this year. Investors should use this dip to buy the stock trading below 6x normalized EPS estimates for a company planning at growing EPS in the 20% range."

Despite compelling products that should nearly sell themselves, most companies spend in excess of research and development budgets on sales and marketing.Yelp is no exception with the company ending 2018 with sales and marketing accounting for an eye-popping 50% of revenues. Product development expenses were only 23% of revenues. The company spent nearly double the amount on S&M and a total of $500 million for all of 2019.The best way to improve the financials at Yelp was to improve the efficiency of the sales force. The company decided that, instead of spending money, getting local advertising customers to sign term contracts, the best option was to develop self-serve ad products with no terms. Yelp faced the risk of customers not spending as much on advertising while the costs of the sales force were due to improve.For Q4, Yelp saw S&M expenses decrease 300 basis points to 47% of revenues. The company grew revenues 10% YoY while S&M expenses only grew 4%. The company cut the local sales force by 10% over last Q4, but spent more on seasoned sales staff and paid out higher commissions due to the improved efficiency of the remaining reps.Source: Yelp Q4'19 shareholder letterIn the process, Yelp grew adjusted EBITDA 17% in 2019 to $213 million while revenues only grew 8%. The market should be impressed by the leverage in the system.The company did miss Q4 revenue estimates by over $4 million, but management appears very confident of the consumer review site returning to mid-teens revenue growth over the long term. For now, CEO Jeremy Stoppelman already sees Q1 revenues tracking in excess of 10% growth:Lots of corporations promote long-term financial models without any legitimate path in the near term of reaching those targets. The progress Yelp made during 2019 provides confidence of continued growth while controlling expenses.Source: Yelp Q4'19 presentationThe company reached 21% EBITDA margins in 2019 for a 2 percentage point boost over 2018. Yelp achieved this jump based on only 8% revenue growth.The main target for reaching 30% EBITDA margins is a further cut in S&M expenses of at least 10 percentage points. The company spent 49% on sales and marketing in 2019, and the goal is to cut this number under 40%. A consumer review website spending up to 40% of revenues on S&M still seems excessive.Regardless, the stock would surge, with Yelp reaching 30% EBITDA margins. Analysts have the company reaching $1.13 billion for 2020 sales and the forecasted EBITDA margins of 22% get the adjusted EBITDA total up to $250 million.For a stock with an enterprise value of ~$2.0 billion, Yelp is very cheap with such an EBITDA target. The company trades at 8x EV/EBTIDA estimates, while the growth rate is at least double this multiple. The stock still appears destined to reach the activists' targets of $55 to $65 suggested by SQN back in early 2019.The key investor takeaway is that Yelp is still hitting some hiccups with the new sales model. Regardless, the company is benefiting from the improved margins from reducing costs while revenues grow. When the company hits full stride with revenues approaching 15% growth and EBITDA growing in excess of 20%, the stock will trade at far higher levels."
4322296,23903,2020-02-07T00:03:21-05:00,Yelp's adjusted earnings multiple is currently discounted relative to the overall market.The company's lower valuation relative to internet peers is justified due to its higher cost structure and the cyclical nature of its business.Yelp faces increasing competition from much larger peers that may eventually marginalize its online media platform.,"(Weekly chart for Yelp with 50- and 200-week moving averages shown in green and red, respectively. A trading channel drawn at $30 and $50 represents the stock's trading range for most of the past five years.)For almost five years, Yelp (YELP) has traded within a fairly narrow trading range. Bulls argue its adjusted earnings have grown steadily to levels that make current valuations among the lowest in the industry. Bears argue the company's growth has stagnated amid rising competitive pressures. The market's indecisiveness reflected in the stock's chart suggests both sides have valid arguments. While the company's relative valuation may seem attractive, investors should keep top line growth as the primary focus. With internet platforms coming and going on a regular basis, Yelp's longer-term viability will depend on its ability to capture and retain market share.Although Yelp stock has been range-bound between $30 and $50 for most of the past five years, the company's business has grown considerably. If its annual revenues hit $1.02 billion estimated for fiscal 2019, the company's revenue growth during the past five years would be an impressive 16.7% CAGR. More importantly, adjusted non-GAAP EPS CAGR would exceed 52%.(Data compiled from Yelp's 2018 annual report and Q3 2019 earnings report. Adjusted non-GAAP EPS based on Wall Street reconciliation of quarterly results. Revenue figures in millions.)At Yelp's recent stock price around $33, the stock is only trading at 17x estimated trailing non-GAAP earnings. At this valuation, its price-to-earnings growth (PEG) would be near 1, based on its CAGR during the past five fiscal years. For an internet portal which many may still consider a high-technology company, Yelp would appear rather cheap especially considering many larger and more mature companies within the main US indexes trade at PEG ratios above 2.Like many internet media portals, Yelp's business posts extremely high gross margin above 90%. Unlike many top-tier internet companies, its operating expenses are also extremely high. As the chart below shows, the gap between the company's gross margin and adjusted non-GAAP operating margin is massive. Even on an adjusted basis, the company's operating expenses has averaged around 80% of revenues during the past five years.(Data compiled from Yelp's 2018 annual report and Q3 2019 earnings report. Adjusted operating margin exclude share-based compensation and non-recurring expenses.)The bulk of Yelp's operating costs have been sales and marketing expenses, which were slightly above 50% of total operating expenses during the first three quarters of 2019. Unlike dominant internet platforms that generate traffic organically, Yelp has to spend considerable dollars to attract traffic to its platform. Unless its platform becomes a household name, recent traffic acquisition trends will likely continue and leave the company vulnerable to pricing dictated by its larger peers.In its November 2019 investor presentation, Yelp has targeted sales and marketing expenses to drop to a range of 36-40% of revenues. If achieved, adjusted EBITDA margin would expand to 30-35% of revenues. This compares to the current guidance of 21-22% adjusted EBITDA margin in fiscal 2019. Moving forward, investors should keep a keen eye on the progress of the company's sales/marketing expense trend and if reductions result in slower top line growth.Unlike many mid-tier internet peers that have not been able to post GAAP profitability even during a decade-long economic expansion post the 2008 Financial Crisis, Yelp has been profitable on a US GAAP basis in the past three years, including fiscal 2019. Although the company does not provide non-GAAP EPS figures for its financial results, it does provide adjusted EBITDA figures, which have been steadily increasing in the past several years.(Data compiled from Yelp's November 2019 investor presentation and Q3 2019 shareholder letter. Adjusted EBITDA figures in millions.)Unfortunately, the chart above also shows a dramatic slowdown in adjusted EBITDA growth in the past three years. If results for the final quarter of 2019 come in as expected, annual adjusted EBITDA growth in 2019 may only barely hit double digits. Since non-GAAP EPS is just a derivative of adjusted EBITDA, figures can easily be calculated by removing the tax-adjusted share-based compensation from each reporting period's GAAP net income. Due to a more normalized tax schedule in 2019, Yelp's non-GAAP EPS may not grow despite an 11% reduction in share count.(Data compiled from Yelp's third-quarter SEC filing. Dollar figures except EPS in millions. Diluted share count in millions.)Moving forward, Wall Street estimates call for around 10% revenue growth in the next three years. Although non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to track slightly higher than revenue growth due to cost-cutting measures, analysts do not expect adjusted earnings to grow faster than low teens percentages.(Data compiled from Yelp's reported results and current Wall Street estimates for future earnings.)In today's market, Yelp stock does represent some value, since its non-GAAP EPS multiple is actually below the broader market average. Compared to many mid-tier internet-based peers that have sacrificed profitability for top line growth, Yelp may appear downright cheap. As long as the overall stock market continues to discount risk as it powers forward making new highs, it would be unlikely that Yelp stock breaks down from a well-established multi-year support around $30. If this trading pattern holds, buying near $30 could yield positive returns with exit points in the upper $30s.(Daily chart for Yelp with 50- and 200-day moving averages shown in green and red, respectively. A support line at $30 has been drawn in purple.)Trading potential aside, there are longer-term risk factors that investors should recognize. Although Yelp operates on the internet, it is essentially an advertising company and should not be considered a technology company. Unless the current economic cycle is truly different, the advertising industry has historically been extremely cyclical. For this reason, valuation comparisons to other internet or software companies would not be accurate. As already witnessed in 2015, a ""mild"" mid-cycle global slowdown resulted in a meaningful deceleration in Yelp's earnings, which caused its stock to drop by over 75%. Should the US economy enter into a recession, the company's high cost structure could result in potentially steep operating losses very quickly.Secondly, Yelp's platform competes against many much larger peers that can generate higher organic traffic. This is the main reason its sales and marketing expenses are so much higher than those of peers. Although the company plans to reduce its marketing expenses as a percentage of revenues, we currently do not know how this would impact revenues. Even though Yelp has first-mover and name recognition advantages today, its platform could be minimized very quickly if the company does not continue to grow its user base.The company's dramatic contraction in annual revenue growth rate to an estimated 8% in 2019 could be an ominous sign. If this revenue trend continues, it could signal market share loss to peers. Investors have seen dozens of once-highly prized portals totally vanish since the dotcom bubble over twenty years ago. Some of those names had much greater competitive advantages then than Yelp does today. Without a distinct competitive advantage, Yelp could be as risky a long-term investment as many of the biggest leading internet darlings were two decades ago. For this reason, investors should not pay a premium multiple for its business.In the short to intermediate term, Yelp could post continued improvements in operating metrics. While the company's long-term target of 30-35% adjusted EBITDA margin is still a long way away from current levels, cost controls could improve this metric by a few hundred basis points in the next several quarters. The company has also been aggressively buying back stock, and still has a positive net cash position to continue this practice. These combined factors should help its non-GAAP EPS grow at a faster rate than revenues. Thus, as long as Yelp meets expected revenue growth, its earnings multiple should continue to decrease and potentially benefit its share price."
4307453,22148,2019-11-18T10:40:41-05:00,"Yelp remains in a tight trading range between $30 and $40.The consumer review site is back on a reasonable path to 10+% revenue growth.The company reduced the diluted share count by 14% over the last year.At 3.0x EV/20 sales estimates, Yelp would trade at nearly $53 or ~50% upside.","Over the course of the year, Yelp (YELP) has been stuck in a range between $30 and $40 despite solid revenue growth mixed with large stock buybacks. These moves generate long-term value for shareholders whether the market realizes the benefits in the short term. My investment thesis remains very bullish on the stock with the chart suggesting a resolution to this tight trading range in the near term.Whether the market fears the threats of Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or not, the consistent revenue growth of Yelp hasn't been rewarded for years. At some point, the market has to quit worrying about a negative and start focusing on the actual business. The company went public with trailing revenues far below $200 million and analysts now forecast the company topping $1.1 billion in 2020.Source: Yelp November presentationThe consumer review site guided to low double-digit growth in Q4 and analysts have the numbers carrying through all of the next two years. Nothing has really changed regarding the TAM since the IPO. Yelp has a substantial market opportunity where $1 billion in annual revenues is only a small blip on the $150 billion local advertising spend.The company has unlimited growth opportunities while an investor has to balance the inability of Yelp to achieve faster growth due in part to Google. The move to shift toward self-serve advertising and eliminating contracts will help remove friction from the advertising model and could bring on a more consistent path towards 10+% growth.As suggested by the title, investors shouldn't wait very long to own Yelp before a likely breakout in the stock from an extended period of trading in a tight range. With enterprise value down to only $2.0 billion after subtracting $417 million in cash, the stock only trades at 1.8x EV/20 sales estimates of $1.14 billion.The market has largely missed that Yelp has spent nearly $700 million on share buybacks and around $475 million this year. The end result is the diluted share count dipping from 88.7 million shares last Q3 to only 73.7 million shares in the recent September quarter.Source: Yelp Q3'19 shareholder letterThe 14% reduction in the share count combined with the double-digit projected revenue growth shouldn't correspond with a flat stock. Using a reasonable valuation of 3.0x EV/20 sales estimates, Yelp would trade at nearly $53 or ~50% upside. In addition, a higher EV/S multiple in the 4x to 5x range wouldn't be impossible with the revenue growth consistently topping 10%.The key investor takeaway is that Yelp has such an extremely cheap valuation for a stock generating 10% revenue growth and shrinking the share count that the recent flat trading range should finally break to the upside. At this point, investors have a limited waiting time for Yelp to head higher and an extremely cheap valuation proceed on the downside with EBITDA margins creeping up towards 25%.Absent any break higher, Yelp will generate tons of free cash flow to continue buying these shares on the cheap. Investing alongside those stocks tends to reward shareholders over the long term."
4319697,104329,2020-01-29T04:44:00-05:00,"Aside from a few pockets of outperformance, restaurant industry equities have been a source of dismal returns, with the recent ""Food Delivery Recession"" causing restaurant-tech stocks to particularly underperform.The indiscriminate selloff has thrown a baby out with the bathwater: Yelp trades at just over 2X EV/Revenue, a deep discount to peers both large and small.Secular tailwinds and new features offered to businesses should push revenue growth into the low teens. Cost improvements should lead to expanding EBITDA margins.A debt-free balance sheet and strong net cash position make Yelp an acquirer's target and the company has aggressively repurchased shares. I see a conservative 50% upside through M&A.Even without M&A, operating leverage from revenue growth in the high-single digits or better will push substantial earnings onto a significantly lowered share count. EPS will drive stock gains.","Yelp (YELP) stock is my top idea for 2020, and I've built a significant position in the low-30s per share. I see a clear path to at least $55 per share or 50% upside from current prices, which could occur either through continued operational execution or M&A.Yelp's balance sheet is rock solid with zero debt and a comfortable cash balance. The company generates substantial free cash flow and does not require capital market access to fund its operations. The company has also voraciously acquired its stock, reducing share count by 16.8% since August of 2018.After hedge fund SQN suggested changes and a strategic review, Yelp seems to be in the early innings of a business turnaround. Management expects new initiatives to drive revenue growth into the teens, versus the consensus estimate of 11% growth in 2020.A portion of this growth stems from increased spending by national and multi-location clients. Another piece of growth comes from new initiatives like verified license, waitlist, and expanding existing services like request a quote.Revenue growth, combined with structural improvements to SG&A costs, will drive earnings growth. Having attained consistent GAAP profitability recently, the company is likely at an inflection point for GAAP earnings.While the thesis benefits from management hitting admittedly lofty targets, due to the potential for M&A, it does not rely on management execution for success. Management's poor performance could lead to shareholders preferring a quick sale of the company, with value realized even sooner.At around $2.4 Billion in enterprise value, the company is certainly affordable. Interested parties are emerging - recently, the Wall Street Journal reported that peer Groupon (GRPN) was considering acquiring Yelp. There are plenty of other companies public and private who could leverage Yelp's revenue, installed user base, and massive customer dataset for substantial economic value. Even private equity firms may be interested in the company's growing EBITDA stream.Frustrated shareholders would likely accept an offer that includes a reasonable premium. I would expect a buyout to yield at least a 50% upside. But even a gradual return to reasonable EV/Sales multiples over the next 12 months could lead to a 50% upside as well. If the company indeed executes on management's stated goals and begins generating substantial and rapidly-growing EBITDA, Yelp could eventually return to all-time highs and beyond through a multiple rerating.After all, while the stock price has languished, the company's fundamentals are intact and improving. Revenues have grown at breakneck speed, and the untapped addressable market is still massive:Source: November Investor PresentationEarnings are beginning to emerge through structural cost improvement and organic revenue growth. Yet the stock is down over 60% from its all-time highs. If Yelp continues to execute, the market will revalue it.My price target is $55 per share, representing a 50% upside. Yelp is a strong buy.Most restaurants and their adjacent businesses have provided lackluster returns for equity holders over the last few years. Yelp is no exception - it has sold off indiscriminately from nearly $100 a share to where it trades today at $36.Its core reviews business faces stiff competition from large online advertisers like Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) as well as niche players such as TripAdvisor (TRIP) or Angie's List (ANGI). But I think a big reason for the selloff is the lack of investor enthusiasm in the restaurant space.Over the last several years, the persistent story behind dine-in and fast food restaurants is the increased reliance on larger order sizes to offset declines in foot traffic. A recent report from tdn2k shows that the narrative is intact:The headwind of lower foot traffic results in sluggish or even negative same-store sales growth. Wage inflation, combined with stagnating growth, has hurt operator profitability.While Yelp's financial performance relies on restaurants, its model arguably benefits from broad foot traffic declines coupled with higher ticket value. The company's primary purpose is to partner with businesses to provide foot traffic to their locations. When traffic is dwindling, and customers are paying more per visit, advertising becomes more valuable. Each marginal customer is bringing in more incremental revenue, and mitigating declines in traffic.This phenomenon could explain why national and multi-location has been such a high growth area for Yelp. With national companies such as Darden (DRI) reporting foot traffic every quarter to concerned investors, buying foot traffic from Yelp is a way to pad the numbers.While declines in foot traffic have created a headwind to restaurant operators, Yelp has uniquely positioned itself to capitalize on the current environment.Yelp was the target of shareholder activism in 2018 when hedge fund SQN, with a 4% stake in the company, released a presentation calling for a strategic overhaul and potentially a sale. The suggestions included further monetization, the addition of independent board members, providing more value-add services for businesses, moving the sales team away from high-cost San Francisco, and buying back nearly $1 billion worth of stock, among others.The changes that SQN suggested would yield a targeted $65 share price representing an 89% premium in a sale to private equity. SQN asserted that a strategic acquirer would be willing to pay even more.Source: SQN PresentationYelp took SQN's critiques to heart and appears to be executing SQN's plan to realize shareholder value. Yelp has reinvigorated its product development pipeline and reduced its share count well below the target of 75 million.Yelp is seeing success by adding new initiatives like Connect and Waitlist, which focus on value-added services to restaurant businesses. Connect provides a platform for restaurants to share updates and events with customers. The Waitlist feature allows a restaurant to manage its seating while simultaneously driving foot traffic to a restaurant.Both are ways for Yelp to add value to businesses. Perhaps more importantly, the above initiatives drive app downloads and in-app use, leveraging the growing installed userbase. Growing in-app traffic is useful because in-app traffic doesn't rely on SEO or paying a 3rd party to drive visitors to a website. In the end, more in-app use from customers drives traffic and adds value to advertisers by lowering the cost to advertise on Yelp.Another service, the $30/month Verified License, creates a low-cost way for Yelp's customers to benefit from Yelp's network of users. This service isn't just a source of recurring revenue; it is a way to get new customers in the door who may pay for more expensive advertising campaigns in the future. These operational changes led to high single-digit revenue growth in 2019, and management is targeting double-digit growth into the future.On the financial front, Yelp checks all of the boxes of a conservatively-run company. It is debt-free and has few long-term liabilities. Yelp is also highly free cash flow generative and does not rely on capital market access to fund its operations. The company has repurchased hundreds of millions of dollars of stock at low valuations, reducing the float significantly.Recent initiatives create a clear path to long-term organic 10%+ revenue growth. Management's long-term target of mid-teens revenue growth reflects this:Source: November PresentationYelp, like other internet peers, has gross margins north of 90%, but high G&A costs, specifically compensation, sales, and development expenses muddled GAAP profitability. But Yelp appears to be at an inflection concerning profitability. Changes to the cost structure combined with revenue growth have resulted in an adjusted EBITDA margin expansion above 20%, with management targeting 30-35% in three years. Operational efficiencies should drive margin expansion and create significant free cash flow at scale. Source: November PresentationThe company has a simple capital structure, positive free cash flows, and a net cash balance, which makes it an attractive buyout target. The company's EBITDA generation could attract interest from private equity. Potential synergies, Yelp's current installed user base, and Yelp's massive dataset could benefit a strategic acquirer. At an enterprise value of around $2.4 Billion, it is a small pill to swallow for most buyers.Above I showed SQN's case for a sale to private equity based on EBITDA. The hedge fund also made the case that a strategic acquirer would also pay up handsomely for Yelp's lead generation ability:Source: SQN PresentationYelp getting swallowed by a much larger competitor is also in the realm of possibility. Though the regulatory environment isn't exactly favorable for the internet giants, they have plenty of capital to put to work. These companies certainly could leverage Yelp's database and lead generation ability.Source: SQN presentationNothing is cheap without reason, and investors have plenty of reasons to doubt the company before investing. Yelp has its fair share of bruises.Yelp's stock has sold off over 60% from all-time highs despite a business that has consistently grown its sales. As a result of the selloff, the stock is undervalued based on a comparison to its internet peers. Healthy gross margins, growing revenues, a debt-free balance sheet, and consistently positive free cash flows all point to a valuable business. Changes set in motion by SQN have already shown green shoots.The company has three ways it can realize value for its shareholders, and each would likely bring above-market returns over the next year.1. Sale to Private Equity. Yelp has been growing both revenues and EBITDA margins. If operational momentum continues, Yelp will begin to generate substantial cash flows. Private equity loves companies with consistent, growing cash flows, and Yelp could be ideal for a buyout. The EBITDA multiples that private equity buyers pay is well into the double digits and growing, according to PitchBook:Assuming the company can generate a yearly run rate of $300 million in EBITDA by the end of 2020, a 12x multiple puts the total enterprise value at around $3.6 billion, or 50% upside.2. Sale to a Strategic Acquirer. A strategic acquirer could use cash or stock to purchase Yelp at a premium to its stock price. Considering the spread in earnings and sales multiples between Yelp and its peers, an acquisition could be highly accretive on profits alone. But the strategic value of Yelp's users and customers could be worth billions in the hands of the right business. According to page 89 of its Yelp presentation, SQN indicates that they have ""spoken to multiple potential buyers that would have a high interest in Yelp should the asset be for sale."" If a strategic acquirer were to purchase Yelp, I'd expect the price to be higher than what a private equity firm would pay.3. Business as Usual. In the past, Yelp has traded at the same lofty sales multiples as its peers. Even as recently as 2018, Yelp's forward EV/Revenues were well above 3X.A change in sentiment from continued execution could result in a reversion to the mean. A regression to 3X EV/Sales would result in 50%+ returns.Yelp will generate significant operating cash flows in 2020, which it can use to repurchase stock. If management hits its sales growth targets, market participants will likely buy the turnaround story. The three-year goal of revenue growth in the mid-teens combined with multiple expansion is attainable. The stock has a clear path to the upside if this occurs.In a market of overvalued, overleveraged companies, Yelp stands out as an excellent risk/reward proposition. My price target of $55 per share represents a 50% upside from today's prices. Yelp is a strong buy."

Year-to-date, Yelp is flat (vs. an 18% gain in the S&P 500).News recently broke that Groupon is exploring a purchase of Yelp. Regardless of whether or not the deal materializes, it calls attention to Yelp's value proposition.Even standalone, the company has a number of growth initiatives under its belt that can revive top-line strength in 2020.Yelp's capital returns program, which has bought back 12% of its stock so far in 2019, also acts as a floor for the company's stock price.","This article was shared with PRO+ Tech subscribers - find out more here.IntroductionYelp (YELP), the perennial dog of the internet sector, continues to be one of the best value-oriented names in the tech sector. Yelp has seen two tailwinds recently - first, a strong earnings beat in Q2 that included both a beat on Wall Street's revenue estimates as well as robust growth in EBITDA; and second, the possibility of an acquisition by Groupon (GRPN).Though shares of Yelp initially rose on both the quarter strength and the Groupon news, its gains have since fizzled out; year-to-date, Yelp shares are still flat:Data by YChartsWe won't speculate on the viability of the Groupon deal, any more than to say that the two internet businesses are highly complementary - and similar to how users can use Yelp both the check restaurant reviews and book a table via Yelp Reservations, a Yelp/Groupon duo could also enable customers to check out reviews for Groupon experiences and book them directly. A combined Yelp/Groupon would put both user research (through Yelp reviews) and the action (buying tickets) under the same roof.Even without Groupon, however, Yelp looks plenty strong (and undervalued) on its own. As shown in the chart below, Yelp is now trading at just over 2x forward revenues and just over 9x forward EBITDA - despite the company's growth on both fronts:Data by YChartsDeal or no deal, stay long on Yelp. There's plenty of value to wring out of this name that the market hasn't yet realized.Yelp itself has acknowledged that its growth over the past several quarters has been lackluster. In Q2, Yelp notched revenues of $247.0 million (+5% y/y), a meager single-digit growth rate that also missed Wall Street's revenue expectations of $247.6 million by a point.Figure 1. Yelp revenue growthSource: Yelp Q2 shareholder letterInvestors still treated the quarter as a strong one, however - primarily because Yelp held to its promise of delivering mid-teens revenue growth in 2020. The slide below, taken from Yelp's Q2 earnings deck, captures Yelp's key strategic priorities to revive revenue growth next year:Figure 2. Yelp growth strategiesSource: Yelp Q2 earnings deckAnother key pillar underscoring Yelp's growth strategy is a more focused sales effort to capture the ""multi-location"" opportunity. Though Yelp has traditionally been strong with single-location ""mom and pop"" type businesses, the company has recently gained traction among larger multi-location businesses and franchises. In Q2, revenues from multi-location clients grew 21% y/y, far faster than Yelp's overall revenue growth. To support this large market opportunity, Yelp plans to increase headcount in its multi-location sales org by 20% in 2019. It reports that these ""national reps"" can bring in about 5x more revenue than local reps that are focused on smaller businesses.Here's some further useful growth commentary from CEO Jeremy Stoppelman's prepared remarks on the most recent earnings call:Key to note from these remarks is that paid ad clicks are up 42% y/y, implying that Yelp's traffic as well as audience engagement are strong. Though Yelp has been around for years, it's still very much a relevant site for consumers, especially in key categories like restaurants and home services.The other element underpinning Yelp's bullish thesis is the company's consistent profitability gains. Here's a look at Yelp's profitability metrics in its most recent quarter:Figure 3. Yelp bottom-line metricsSource: Yelp Q2 earnings deckYelp's Adjusted EBITDA, the company's primary measure of bottom-line strength, rose 17% y/y (far faster than revenue growth), while EBITDA margins cranked up two points to 22%. Yelp's pro forma EPS of $0.16 also grew a stunning 30% y/y, while also beating Wall Street's expectations of $0.12.Yelp is no longer in growth mode, so it's capitalizing on that in order to slice down expenses as a percentage of revenues. In particular, sales and marketing expenses (Yelp's biggest expense category) fell two points as a percentage of revenues to 49% (vs. 51% in 2Q18). Yelp expects to wring further efficiencies out of its sales teams. Per its own commentary in its most recent shareholder letter: ""We expect overall sales headcount to decline modestly by the end of 2019, as our decreasing reliance on growing Local sales headcount to drive revenue growth more than offsets the growth of our multi-location sales teams.""Yelp has made use of its profitability growth to return capital directly to shareholders. In the year-to-date, Yelp has returned $398 million to shareholders in the form of buybacks , wiping out 12% of the company's existing market cap. The company expects to continue buyback activity in the back half of 2019, and Yelp's currently depressed stock price actually presents a good opportunity to buyback shares at a discount.There's a lot to like about Yelp, especially at current levels in the mid-$30s. With or without Groupon, Yelp is clearly executing on a strategy to drive growth and profitability gains in 2020 and beyond. With its new focus on multi-location advertising deals (which so far are growing at a >20% y/y clip), Yelp is looking to move beyond the saturation point that it hit with smaller businesses.Stay long here and wait for the rebound."

The company has utilized expense control to generate large cash flows to substantially reduce share counts in a huge benefit to shareholders. The market will slowly catch on to the bullish cash flow story for a company growing revenues up to 10% annually.Yelp shifted towards a non-term advertising model last year to attract more local businesses to the consumer review platform. The shift hasn't necessarily delivered the top-line benefits, with revenues only growing 5% in Q2. All of the other key business metrics such as app unique devices, paying advertising locations and cumulative reviews grew at rates faster than revenues.Source: Yelp Q2'19 presentation The benefit to the no-term ad model has actually occurred in the efficiency of the local sales force. Yelp was able to grow revenues without the expansion of the sales force. In Q2, the advertising sales force declined by 1%. In the process, the sales and marketing expenses dipped to 49% of sales, down from 51% last year.The company is now able to focus on the product development bucket where expense levels aren't even 50% of sales and marketing. The end result is an EBITDA margin expansion to 22% of sales. EBITDA grew 17% YoY to $55 million.Yelp is able to improve sales force efficiency by focusing on national accounts with multiple locations while the smaller customers can now utilize the self serve product. In addition, the national accounts can be more efficiently served out of cheaper sales offices outside the San Francisco area. The lack of a contract eliminates a lot of the friction that required a dedicated and large sales force in the first place.Growing companies don't typically trade with a $2.7 billion market cap or ~$2.3 billion enterprise value with forecasts of EBITDA topping $200 million. The forecast for 8% to 10% revenue growth in Q3 is even more attractive knowing costs can be contained for improved leverage. The ability to grow app unique devices and paying ad accounts are all indications that revenue growth can indeed return to the double-digit growth rates.The big advantage to large cash balances and positive cash flow streams was very evident in the Q2 results. Yelp has utilized the $756 million cash balance at the start of the year to significantly reduce outstanding shares.During the quarter, the company spent $295 million to repurchase 8.8 million shares. Yelp has now spent $398 million on stock buybacks in the 1H of the year. The average diluted share count ended at 78.5 million shares.Data by YChartsThe advantage here is the per-share figures like EPS where the number grew 30% YoY. The GAAP EPS number included $30 million in stock-based compensation, so the number isn't ultimately very useful for investors.A better view might just be EBITDA per share as follows:EBITDA per share grew over 50% in the quarter from last Q2. Yelp ended June with $458 million in cash on the balance sheet plus generated free cash flows in the 1H of nearly $80 million. The combination of a strong balance sheet and plentiful cash generation sets up the consumer review site to continue repurchasing shares and boosting per-share metrics like EBITDA per share.The key investor takeaway is that Yelp remains a bargain misunderstood by investors focused purely on revenue growth and the EPS metric. With a simple metric of EBITDA reaching $265 million next year ($1.15 billion revenues @ 23% margin), the stock only trades at ~9x EV/EBITDA estimates. With the consumer review site generating EBITDA growth rates far in excess of 10%, the stock trades at an extreme bargain due to the market missing this obvious shift in the cash flows of the business."

Despite the down results in Q4 - an infrequent but necessary condition of our investment approach - we are quite pleased with the results for the year, and perhaps even more importantly, how it positions us as we head into 2019.","Original PostChoice Equities Fund commentary for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018, discussing their new potions in Under Armour (UA) and Rubicon Project (RUBI).Dear Investor:We are pleased to report strong absolute and relative performance for Choice Equities Fund, LP (CEF or the Fund) for the year, up +15.9% and +12.1% on a gross and net basis, respectively. Our annual performance compares quite well in a tough period for the markets, which saw the Russell 2000, the S&P 500 and our primary Blended Benchmark finish in the red at -11.0%, -4.4% and -9.4%. The fourth quarter in particular was a rough one for equities investors, as the Russell 2000 led the way down on -20.2% performance, with the S&P 500 following at -13.5%. Our stocks were not immune to the sell-off, as the Fund posted a net decline of -12.9%. Despite the down results in Q4 - an infrequent but necessary condition of our investment approach - we are quite pleased with the results for the year, and perhaps even more importantly as I will discuss below, how it positions us as we head into 2019. Our total net compounded return since becoming an independent firm two years ago now stands at $1.36 for every $1.00 invested, versus the $1.06 return derived from our Blended Benchmark.As is customary in our year-end letters, we will offer some commentary on the market's performance and examine the drivers of return on an annual basis. We will then provide an update on CEF performance for the quarter, before offering a few words on our typical portfolio construction and how we measure success in differing market conditions. We have two new positions to discuss and note their full write-ups are in the appendices, which comprise four pages of this nine-page letter. Finally, we close with some thoughts on the outlook for the year upcoming and what it means for our portfolio.For equities investors of nearly all stripes, 2018 ended as a year to forget. The year began well enough. Enthusiasm was strong as participants cheered the recent passing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Business confidence and earnings growth, in part driven by the arithmetic effects of the lowered tax rate, was surging. A February wobble followed an unusually strong start to the year, but investors largely looked past the decline given the strong economic backdrop. As summer arrived, issues surfaced, and the tailwinds that had largely become priced in gave way to emerging headwinds and new deterrents to growth. While newspapers had little trouble finding fodder for headlines, the primary issues of tightening monetary policy, an emerging trade war with China and rapidly declining oil prices disrupted the serene picture of synchronized global growth that had previously emerged, and investors soon began to reprice markets for the lower growth trajectory.Markets began their decline as the calendar turned to Q4 and ultimately entered a ""bear"" market, given the S&P 500's decline of greater than 20% off its highs in August. As is often the case in these selloffs, small caps led the way down in terms of order and magnitude of decline. Potentially exacerbating the quarter's decline was the fact that much of the downdraft occurred in the typically quiet month of December. Absent some of the usual market participants, lower liquidity, year-end positioning and tax motivations created a trading environment that produced the biggest decline for the markets in the month of December since 1931, ultimately leaving most equities investors with losses on the year. Looking closer at small cap performance, we see an astounding 89% of these securities finished in the red for the quarter - a higher percentage of declining stocks than even Q4 of 2008, and the fourth worst percentage in the index's 40-year history. (For a full accounting of the quarter that was for small caps, I found this piece from Royce Funds interesting.)Interestingly, only two of the four periods of similar decline are associated with economic weakness. As we look at the drivers of returns on an annual basis by reviewing our year end template, it seems we will likely add another episode to the list, as it was clearly not weak earnings growth that caused the decline. In actuality, it was more likely the reverse, as the Fed used the strong economic growth as grounds to institute four rate hikes rather than the three originally envisioned at the year's start. The higher rates, themselves suggestive of lower multiples (albeit moderately so), seem to have also spurred on a change in mood which precipitated a big shrink in P/E multiples. While perhaps a gross oversimplification, it seems one could characterize 2018's market performance as the year that: what fiscal policy giveth, monetary policy taketh.Like the markets, most of our stocks declined in the quarter. Any stocks we owned in size impacted the portfolio accordingly, while light hedging activity produced gains of a little more than 1%. No position detracted more than 2.5% for the quarter, though our holdings in YELP, BXC, UA, DEST, and DS each detracted ~2% from gross portfolio performance. Despite their price declines, the businesses are performing as expected on a fundamental basis.The lone possible exception to this categorization is YELP. It seems the company's transition to non-term contracts is not going as seamlessly as originally anticipated. Though a few elements of the conversion have proven disruptive, the biggest factor that has slowed near-term top-line growth likely stems from a change in the company's compensation model for its sales force. It seems reps did not adjust to the model with the ease originally expected, and many chose to leave more quickly than the company had anticipated. With fewer reps onboarding paying advertising accounts than targeted, revenue growth slowed. Though the transition has been bumpier than expected, the company's strong balance sheet and healthy base of user reviews remain. It is also encouraging to see the company recently completed an outstanding stock buyback and has initiated a new one to capitalize on the lower share price. Though the transition has not been a smooth one, the long-term case remains.DEST - Our position in Destination Maternity presents our latest example of the so-called efficient markets at work and further highlights the vagaries inherent in investing in the small cap space. The company reported 3Q results early in December. Though mostly on track, a few elements revealed during the report were not exactly spot on with expectations, and shares were severely punished. Inventory came in a little higher than anticipated, and sales growth in the eCom channel, previously a real bright spot for the company, slowed. Though management reiterated their outlook for FY2019, for FY2018 they lowered their sales guidance by 100 basis points and lowered the high end of EBITDA guidance. All in all, the unanticipated elements and slight shift from expectations was simply not a great look for a team that had just unveiled their big strategic plan just five weeks prior.But does lowering the top end of EBITDA guidance of $17M by $1M really mean that the company is worth half what it used to be? Mr. Market said yes. Though skeptical of this re-rating, I of course began double-checking our work. A week later, I had the good pleasure of meeting with the team at the company headquarters in Moorestown, NJ. Upon further examination, and as highlighted by management on the call, many of the ""issues"" from the 3Q report had reasonable and explainable causes. For example, the $7M of excess inventory was from a prior management team and is believed to be monetizable without meaningful discounts. And the eCom growth, while slower than before, came at significantly higher margins and double-digit gross profit dollar growth.More importantly, the long-term vision - to become a leaner, more efficient company with high returns on capital that dominates a unique specialty retail niche - remains quite achievable. Like most things in the real world, I do not expect the benefits of these efforts to come neatly or in a precisely linear or flawless fashion. But I do expect them to come. With a view that the team is talented and their plan to grow cash flows at 20% or better for the next few years is achievable, we viewed the valuation of less than 4x EBITDA as attractive and unlikely to persist for long. We took the market's reaction as an overreaction and used it as an opportunity to add to the position.New Positions - Under Armour and Rubicon Project are our newest positions. Though they differ by size and industry and seem to have nothing in common on the surface, both fit our investment framework for quality and potential return. Somewhat like Chipotle (CMG), Under Armour is our latest smallish, large cap and another strong brand's story of progress interrupted. The thesis rests on the case the company can perform better than it has recently and is currently underearning relative to normalized margins. Rubicon Project is the other platform company alluded to last quarter and is probably even more interesting, as I believe it offers an opportunity to make multiples on our investment over a multi-year time horizon. Both write-ups are included in the appendix.A Word On CEF Portfolio Construction - If we are going to outperform the ""stock market"", an understanding of the typical behavior of the stocks in the market is useful. As Q4 of 2018 has just demonstrated, the dichotomy of performance between the ""market"" and the stocks within the market can be quite wide, especially when things go haywire as they seem to every two or three years or so. Consider that while the S&P 500 was down -13.4%, small caps fared worse and underperformed their larger peers by a fairly significant 7%. Perhaps more interestingly, when looking closer at the small cap index itself, we see that while the ""market"" was down -20.2% for the quarter, a quarter of the stocks within it were down over -33%, and the ""average"" stock, or median decline, from its 52-week high was -37%.This may seem like bad news for small cap investors. To the contrary, it is actually good news. And it is also a primary reason our portfolio is structured the way it is. As far as stocks go, I view the small cap pond as unequivocally the best one to fish in. There are more stocks. There is more volatility. They offer greater information inefficacies. Put simply, the space just offers a greater likelihood of finding outstanding risk/reward situations that can help us generate attractive investment results. But it is not all good news. When the air goes out of the balloon every so often as it always does, they frequently suffer the worst.For this reason - in conjunction with the fact that I have all of my investable assets invested in the fund - I do not want a portfolio that is always entirely comprised of small cap stocks. Instead, I prefer a portfolio of equities with balance that is equally as capable of outperforming in a down market as it is in an up market. Though nobody can reliably predict when either will come, that does not mean we cannot prepare for both. When one considers the math behind the compounding of capital, it is easy to embrace the notion that the path to capital creation runs first through capital preservation. Accordingly, our approach is one that seeks to balance the risks of the occasional drawdowns that necessarily accompany equities, while enabling us to participate in the upside that comes along with the creation of these valuable enterprises. As sure as risk and return are two sides of the same coin, if we are able to mitigate losses during these sell-offs, we have the opportunity to benefit doubly: initially from this minimization of loss of capital, and then subsequently from the selective purchase of a few securities from a highly attractive pool of newly created bargains.For these reasons as it pertains to our long-biased, concentrated investing approach, I view any outperformance in a down market as a success. Though our portfolio declined during the quarter, we successfully minimized a meaningful loss of capital. Perhaps more importantly, we did so while simultaneously improving our prospective returns through the buying and selling of existing and new holdings from a highly attractive opportunity set. While giving back gains or experiencing paper losses is never a joyous occasion in the moment, it is an infrequent but necessary condition of our investment approach.Though I am quite satisfied with our results for the very brief period that was this past quarter, I am even more pleased with our results for the bigger and more important picture that is this past year. To see why, let us compare our results to the indices - our basically free investment alternative. Whereas small cap index investors can now purchase an earnings stream that is still expected to grow at some double-digit rate in the near term, they have to do so from a capital base that has depreciated by a greater amount, effectively negating the opportunities unearthed in the recent market turmoil. On the other hand, in our fortunate circumstance, we are adding a few specific and highly targeted earnings streams, most of which have fallen farther, that are growing faster, that we get to purchase from a capital base that has appreciated. So, while I am delighted with our up performance in a down year, I am even more excited about how this result coupled with our activities in a sloppy trading environment position us for an attractive compounding result next year.The word of the moment seems to be uncertainty. Little clarity has surfaced in our ongoing trade war with China, recent market conditions have been choppy, and the dysfunction coming from Washington seems to be even more dysfunctional than usual. Earnings growth has decelerated as the arithmetic effects of the tax cut fade, and many view the path forward as less clear than it was a few months ago. The market's trailing P/E multiples have recently trended to near the lows of the last five years, suggesting a plausible argument could be made some of this slower growth has already been discounted. Of course, the trailing numbers tell us nothing of what growth is to come, but our base case suggests continued but slower earnings growth for our domestic economy. Whatever the trajectory of earnings growth, I expect the placid conditions of 2017 will come to be remembered as the anomaly they were, and the more elevated volatility will be here to stay. For the active manager, these periods have often brought great opportunities, even if it was not always clear that was the case at the moment.Our eclectic portfolio, composed of 10-15 businesses with their own idiosyncratic risks and company-specific stories, appears set to perform well in this environment. Though our holdings will assuredly be influenced by the market direction in the short term, in the medium to longer term our performance will be driven by the business results of these specific companies and the unfolding of the catalysts that lay in front of them. Consider DEST, whose prospects will be determined far more by management's ability to execute on their plan rather than a moderate move in the broader stock market. And we are currently adding another one that fits this bill. While many would likely lump these into the event-driven/special situation bucket, I simply think of them as undervalued opportunities that fit our investment framework. While not all our positions fit this catalyst-driven framework, our portfolio offers a nice balance consisting of many that do and position us well to perform in most any market environment.As I wrote in a brief Christmas Eve missive to our investors after considering the price to value discrepancy of our portfolio, I believe these winter months will prove to have been a very attractive time to add to our portfolio. While I am pleased with our track record since inception and our trajectory in our first two years as an independent company, I continue to believe that on both an absolute and relative basis, the best is still yet to come.In closing, while I know our approach will not yield outperformance each and every quarter, I continue to believe it will be well worth our while over the long haul. Perhaps more importantly, given the majority of our investable assets are invested alongside yours, we would never ask investors to assume risks we ourselves will not.Thank you for your continued support as we work to grow our capital together. As always, we are happy to discuss our investment outlook with you at your convenience. Please reach out any time.Best regards,Mitchell Scott, CFAPortfolio ManagerUA - Heading into 2015, Under Armour's success story was nearly unparalleled in sports and brand building history. Built largely from founder Kevin Plank's blood and sweat on the back of his crafty and savvy marketing moves, the company was the fastest brand to achieve $5B in sales in modern history. Founded in 1996 by the then 24-year-old entrepreneur out of his grandmother's basement, the company did a whopping $17,000 in sales of the moisture-wicking undershirts the company has now become famous for in that first year of business. 10 years later, the company had $281M in sales and was newly public. Life as a public company was good, and the brand came out of the gate hot, posting sales growth in excess of 20% for an astounding 26 quarters straight. (Much of that origin story is told here in a recent interview with David Rubenstein.)In 2015, emboldened by its success to date, the company unveiled a three-year plan to ""Get Big Fast."" The plan was predicated on moving the brand into the big three sports brand hierarchy side by side Nike (NKE) and Adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY) and capturing the benefits that went along with it. They targeted big sales growth spurred on by a big marketing push to support new product launches. The big plans carried big spending and a growing cost structure that matched. Unfortunately for the company, their timing could not have been much worse, as the company went for growth headlong right into what has now become known as the retail apocalypse. Amazon's (AMZN) impact, previously a nagging competitive issue to retailers, abruptly became acute. Retailers began closing stores. Some like Under Armour's second largest customer, Sports Authority, who had been struggling gradually, suddenly went bankrupt. Sales growth went from +20% into the red for one quarter. Inventory accumulated in the channel. Gross margins fell ~400 bps, and the company deleveraged on their expanded cost structure with EBITDA margins getting cut in half to 7%. Over a tough two-year period, shares got cut into less than a third of their prior value.As they say in investing circles, the brand hit the wall. Of course, this was not their intended outcome, but the event is not without precedent. Nike hit the wall in 1982. While it was a different era, many parallels exist. Both brands were 21 years old. Nike sales growth slowed from 25% to low single digits. Inventory accumulated in the channel. Gross margins fell by some 500 basis points, and the company similarly deleveraged on its cost structure with EBITDA margins falling from 18% to 6%. Over a tough two-year period, shares got cut into less than a third of their prior value. And then they bottomed to create what turned out to be one of the great buying opportunities of a lifetime. Shares were up five-fold over the next five years and never looked back.Our thesis here is not built on the notion Under Armour is the next Nike. Our thesis is built on the notion the company wants to perform better. And while it seems a given most public companies all want to do better, it is not a given everybody can. That is why a valued brand is critical to thesis. Though the brand remains strong, the company's momentum, an underappreciated concept in business, has currently waned. Due to the recent underperformance and bloated inventory, some of the company's marketing efforts were curtailed. With fewer earnings dollars to spend, many new product initiatives were also delayed. Accordingly, for much of the last two years, the company has been focused on cutting costs and has generally been in retrenchment mode.At their recent analyst day, it was clear the company has a major focus on becoming a leaner and higher returning business. They spoke to more targeted marketing initiatives, faster new product development and improved measurement of return on marketing spend. Now compensated primarily on EBIT dollar growth, the company is incentivized to emerge a leaner, higher-returning and more adaptive brand. Will the company's new products respond to marketing as they have in the past? Only time will tell. But it seems Kevin Plank's ability to create something from nothing is surely an indication he can again create sustained success from a company that now finds itself among the elite brands in sports. While valuation looks expensive on current multiples, it also seems to imply market participants suggest very little likelihood the company will ever regain its prior operating margin success. While a Nike-like run from here is clearly far from assured, it is perhaps not as far-fetched as a first glance might suggest.Rubicon Project - In small cap land, it is often said it is more important to bet on the right jockey than the right horse. (I found an interview on this subject with MicroCap Club Founder Ian Cassell interesting.) The thinking goes that the smaller the company, fewer bureaucratic layers provide a CEO with more authority and responsibility for strategic direction and successful execution of corporate aims. Greater touches with company leaders and employees provide a strong leader more opportunity to influence company culture and leave an outsized mark on company performance. While I have found this to be generally true in my experience, that does not mean we are not on the lookout for thoroughbreds too. So, what about a situation where we are betting on a jockey who is betting on his chosen horse? I believe we have that here with Rubicon Project.The Rubicon Project is an independent ad exchange platform that focuses on automating the process of buying and selling digital ads. As a supply-side exchange, the company's principal focus is on matching the ad inventory of its content publishing customers with brands and advertisers who are looking for digital real estate for their ads. Given the thousands of miniature auctions that take place to match a buyer and seller to create an impression (i.e., a successfully matched ad), the company relies on algorithms to match the best bids with the appropriate content all in a way that places ads quickly, so the content is displayed without delay. Today, ~$1B of ad spend goes through the company's platform, which processes trillions of impressions per month. For its role in sourcing and matching advertising demand, the company keeps a small percentage of the ad value flowing through its platform as a fee, known as its take rate.The global programmatic ad market is large, estimated at ~$34B today. While Facebook (FB), Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon are the largest players (who importantly also already have their own ad inventory), the rest of the industry is quite fragmented and growing strongly. Mobile is the big driver of growth today, but other uses like programmatic audio for companies like Spotify (SPOT) and connected TV applications suggest the industry is likely to continue to grow at a mid-teens rate in the coming years. As one of the largest remaining standalone independent ad exchange platforms, Rubicon is currently very well-positioned to capture much of this industry growth. But it was not always this way.In early 2017, when company founder and CEO Frank Addante began looking to move to the boardroom and install a new CEO, the company was facing a number of challenges. Rubicon was late to respond to the industry's move to header-bidding, an open auction format that was a change from the more insulated waterfall ad matching structure that had allowed the company to thrive on its close-knit publishing relationships. With ads effectively bypassing the Rubicon platform, the company's place in the value chain soon came under question. It was losing share, ads going through the platform were declining and take rates were shrinking. In May 2017, well-regarded ad tech industry veteran Michael Barrett joined the company as CEO in the midst of this shift in the industry. With strong credentials, including two nine figure exits and a stint as Yahoo's Chief Revenue Officer, we view his industry experience and contacts and understanding of the competitive landscape as a major plus.So, we found one of Barrett's first moves after joining the company to be quite surprising. A few months into his tenure, he effectively cut the company in half by deciding to take their demand side take rates down to 0%. No longer was Rubicon a two-sided exchange charging fees to both parties in the transaction; instead, it became a one-sided exchange focused primarily on sourcing the best demand possible for its content-providing customers. By eliminating the buy-side fee, the company's role in the bid matching process is now more clearly understood as solely that of an aggregator of purchasing demand for its publishing customers. In an industry that has had its fair share of shady players who have used the opaque nature of the marketplace as a conduit to overcharge, gouge and even in some cases defraud its customers, the company has eliminated any appearances of self-dealing that the two-sided platforms sometimes face. The eliminated buyer fees have also reduced the total cost of transacting on the Rubicon platform, which has enabled it to attract a greater access to inventory. By moving to a transparent, efficient and low-cost model, the company has positioned its platform to thrive as a one-sided marketplace focused on high volume and low cost per transaction.These strategic moves appear aptly timed as another trend in the industry, Supply Path Optimization (SPO), has spurred many advertisers to shrink the number of platforms they are using to locate ad inventory. Buying groups such as advertising agencies and demand-side platforms are concluding more meaningful relationships with fewer exchanges are preferable to the inverse and lead to a higher-quality experience of placing ads and an improved ability to measure ROI. These trends and the competitive dynamics typically associated with scaled exchanges with powerful network effects suggest that ad platforms which currently number in the hundreds will likely consolidate down to five or ten in the coming years. It is likely some may exit due to the synergistic nature of an acquisition by a player with its own existing inventory, as we recently saw with AT&T's (T) purchase of AppNexus. The transaction is speculated to have occurred at ~8x multiple of sales, a level which speaks to the synergistic nature of opening up a content provider's inventory to a broader pool of buyers, as well as the conflicts of interest potentially involved when an exchange platform is not truly independent.Rubicon's move to cut its demand side buyer fees - one of the ultimate in the category of short-term pain for long-term gain - has positioned the company quite well to emerge as one of the few consolidating exchanges of scale. But few investors seem to have noticed as consolidated financials continue to paint the portrait of a business in transition. As the company is still lapping tough comparisons from the prior year due to the change in business model, 3Q 2018 consolidated financials show the company posted an 18% decline in sales. But for people looking a little closer, signs of a healthy and growing business are there. The take rate has been increasing modestly, while ad spend going through the platform is growing 24%. Secular growth drivers like streaming video which are associated with higher spend per ad are now coming into view, with sales in this vertical growing at a 70% rate. With the company enjoying high incremental margins and expecting sales growth in the ~20% range, it likely will not take long for the financials to present a different picture. With half of its market cap in cash, shares at less than 1x EV/sales look attractive and offer a realistic path to earning multiples on our investment over the coming years.Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors."
4265329,105094,2019-05-20T13:19:39-04:00,"YELP is down ~20% since reporting 1Q19 results. Though guidance was a bit light, fundamentals remain strong.
        Management has implemented several initiatives that are poised to contribute to sustainable growth for the foreseeable future.
        YELP currently trades at an EV / fwd EBITDA multiple that is near its all-time lowest level; this created an attractive opportunity for investor returns moving forward.
        Competition risk is the greatest headwind YELP faces and it is of paramount importance that management continues to differentiate itself from peers.","As shown above, Yelp (ticker: YELP) investor returns were quite disappointing following its 1Q19 earnings release. However, this pullback provides an intriguing opportunity as full-year guidance remains strong, yet YELP’s valuation has significantly contracted. The following investment thesis will provide a brief reasoning of recent stock price weakness, a discussion of several catalysts that should propel the company further, and a snapshot of YELP’s current deflated valuation. Though it faces certain headwinds that might contribute to slower future growth, these risks seem manageable and the risk/reward profile of YELP is very attractive.Furthermore, YELP is a prime candidate for accretive partnerships, acquisitions, and/or potentially being acquired by larger peers. Though this report will not focus on such details (as it is currently all speculation), shareholders should remain encouraged by this potential, nonetheless.The day following its 1Q19 earnings results, YELP’s stock price dropped 14%. It proceeded to drop an additional 7% the following day and is trading fairly close to that level currently. The plausible reason for this 20%+ pullback seems to stem from its 2Q19 guidance, as 1Q19 revenue and EBITDA results were in-line with the Street and management did not change its FY 2019 guidance. Paying advertisement accounts disappointed within 1Q19 results. However, variability Q-o-Q should be expected, especially considering specific issues that plagued small businesses during that quarter (ie. government shutdown, market meltdown from the prior quarter, sentiment dropping, etc).For 2Q19, YELP expects revenue growth to be mid-single-digit Y-o-Y, as opposed to high-single-digit growth expected from the Street. In addition, 2Q19 EBITDA growth expectations were lowered a few hundred basis points. Overall, it seems as though expectations might have been too frothy going into 1Q19 earnings and estimates for 2Q19 seem to have disappointed investors. If fundamentals remain strong and its 2019 results end up being backloaded, then YELP’s stock should rebound accordingly.Though results might have missed ambitious expectations, YELP continues to report solid, sustainable growth:[source: company financials]Though 1Q19 results were decent and 2Q19 guidance was light, YELP’s business model remains strong. Listed below are several catalysts that should propel investor returns for years to come:Management’s Financial GoalsWithin YELP’s 1Q19 results, management highlighted many steps they plan to initiate to create long-term shareholder value. Though most were generalized ambitions (such as expanding margins, building effective partnerships, and implementing shareholder friendly capital allocations), one tangible goal is ~15% compounded revenue growth over the next five years. Though this figure lags what YELP has been able to accomplish since inception, it is encouraging nonetheless as the company continues to mature (based on both consumer and business engagement). The recent pullback after its Q1 results do not reflect a company that can confidently double its revenue over the next five years.Management’s Strategic GoalsSince reporting 2018 results, management has laid out some strategic initiatives that it intends to implement in order to continue growing the company. These include:Share Repurchase AgreementOn February 11th, YELP’s board authorized an additional $250mm of share repurchases on top of the $250mm authorized on November 27th of last year. During 1Q19, YELP repurchased $100mm shares and it purchased an additional $100mm thereafter (totaling $200mm YTD as of May 2nd). Therefore, $300mm remains authorized currently, which equates to 12% of YELP’s market cap.Cash Flow GenerationThe chart below displays the free cash flow YELP generated over the past several years:[source: S&P Capital IQ]Since 2015, YELP consistently generates strong cash flow that can support future capital allocation decisions (such as further share repurchase programs or accretive acquisitions / partnerships). Finally, YELP’s balance sheet is strong with $626mm of cash, as of 1Q19. The combination of cash flow generation and a strong balance sheet is an encouraging sign for YELP investors.New Board MembersEarlier this year, YELP announced the appointment of three new board members:Per the press release, “George, Sharon and Brian are experienced business veterans who bring a wealth of practical, hands-on knowledge and skill sets to Yelp, including scaling operations, sales, marketing, product and monetization,” said Jeremy Stoppelman. “George has an extensive track record in operations, including 13 years at Salesforce prior to joining Twilio, where he currently serves as COO. Sharon is an accomplished marketing executive who most recently served as CMO of Starbucks, overseeing the growth of their mobile apps and loyalty programs. Brian is a successful technology CEO with significant experience operating e-commerce and marketplace businesses.” YELP’s initiative in diversifying and strengthening its board of directors is a positive sign for the business, and ultimately, its shareholders.Small Business OptimismThough YELP began implementing a national / enterprise advertisement program, its partnerships with small businesses are vitally important to its overall business model. Below are some charts highlighting optimism surrounding small business owners and their likely willingness to continue subscribing to YELP’s product offering:[source: The NFIB Research Foundation][source: ISM Non-Manufacturing Index][source: S&P Capital IQ]As highlighted above, YELP’s EV / fwd EBITDA multiple significantly contracted recently and trades near its all-time lowest level. Even though YELP’s growth profile slowed over the past couple of years, it should still grow at a much greater clip than the overall stock market. In addition, its strong balance sheet and solid ability to generate cash flow should translate to a higher multiple relative to peers, all things equal. Therefore, YELP investors should expect material multiple expansion should 2H19 results meet management’s guidance.CompetitionThe biggest risk associated with an investment in YELP is competition. Unfortunately, its business model does not encompass significant barriers to entry, and any online community can provide very similar features to what YELP offers its consumers. For example, Google and Amazon have massive networks and provide home service capabilities very similar to YELP. The only advantage YELP has over its peers is scale, as highlighted by the cumulative 180 million reviews posted on its website. It will take a long time for any other company to match its user engagement database. Furthermore, YELP’s massive network coupled with a (relatively) small market cap of ~2.5b could make it a prime candidate for acquisition by one of those monster companies.Stock-based compensation / share dilutionAnother investment risk associated with YELP is the consistent and overwhelming share dilution caused by its generous stock-based compensation plans. Even though YELP’s board approved a $500mm repurchase agreement in February, diluted shares outstanding continues to grow at a discouraging pace. As of FY 2016, diluted shares outstanding were 77mm. Currently, it is about 90mm. This dilution will pressure YELP’s valuation going forward, even if it is able to meet (or exceed) its lofty financial goals.CyclicalityYELP operates in a cyclical industry and its small business partners are highly sensitive to economic conditions. Any investment allocations to YELP should be within the consumer discretionary sector of investor portfolios.As highlighted throughout this report, the significant pullback in YELP’s stock price provided an enticing opportunity for investors. There are several catalysts that should help propel the company to meet its ~15% growth expectation, and YELP’s current valuation materially underestimates this potential. Though competition risk will be an indefinite issue, the risk/reward profile of YELP is very attractive."
4236173,67473,2019-01-29T06:39:40-05:00,"Greenhaven Road Capital is a long-biased, concentrated hedge fund. We invest only in our very best ideas – typically 15 long positions or less and a handful of opportunistic short positions.Generally avoiding commodity-based companies, we look for businesses with strong cash flow, normalized earnings, and long term growth horizons.Includes detailed analysis of the fund's positions in KKR, BlueLinx, Fiat Chrysler, Box, SharpSpring, Etsy, Yelp.","Original PostGreenHaven Road Capital commentary for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2018.Dear Fellow Investors,The fourth quarter was not a profitable one for the partnership. In fact, statistically, it was the least profitable we have had in several years. For investors in the Long-Term Class, returns were approximately -20.7% for the quarter and -10.5% for the year. You may take some solace in the fact that the Russell 2000 was down -22% for the quarter and down -11% for the year.As I have written before, if we want to have the opportunity for significant up quarters, we have to be able to tolerate significant down quarters. We will not get the ups without the downs. Over time, there should be more ups than downs, but there will be both. Despite our Q4 2018 returns, the fund has still outperformed major indices over the last three years, five years, and since inception (eight years). Given the embedded valuations of our holdings, I like our prospects. What goes down can also go up. Our portfolio is stocked with companies I believe have high insider ownership, strong products, attractive valuations, and asymmetric return profiles. While paper losses were incurred in the short term, opportunities were created for the long term.Given that down periods are an inevitability of investing in a concentrated, long-biased fashion, the question is: what do I do during these periods of rapidly declining markets? The simplest solution would be to just time the market. Sell when prices are high, sit out the entirety of the declines, and buy shares right at the bottom just before prices begin their rebound. Sounds good to me. Unfortunately, I don't know how to time the market effectively, nor am I aware of any person or computer that has consistently done so. Inevitably, market timing leads to underinvestment. Portions of the downside are often avoided, but so are the recoveries. Given the positive expected values of our investments over the long term, trying to predict the daily movements of the market is not likely to improve returns. As a result, little effort is devoted to it.Where, then, is effort focused? I try to balance three competing forces during these periods of high volatility and rapidly declining prices. The first is a desire to be a long-term shareholder and just hold tight. Even the highest- quality companies like Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) and Nike (NYSE:NKE) have each had multiple 50%+ drawdowns during their decades of heroic returns. Only those able to endure the pain of such declines actually participated in the 100X+ returns that ultimately were realized by the holders. Doing nothing is far harder than it sounds but is often richly rewarded in the equity markets when you hold a portfolio of companies with high insider ownership, recurring revenue, operating leverage, and the ability to grow with no additional capital.The desire to just hold conflicts with a recognition that volatility creates opportunities. In a period where the average stock in the Russell 2000 is down in excess of 20%, there are hundreds of stocks down 30% or more from their recent highs. A stock that declines 33% has to gain 50% to recoup those losses. Buying fundamentally sound businesses that have sold off for non-fundamental reasons can be a very profitable endeavor. The second competing desire is thus to upgrade our portfolio. Have all of those companies' prospects really diminished by so much so quickly? When my wife hears ""risk off,"" she wants to start stuffing money in our mattress and assume the fetal position - yet in reality, ""risk off"" is shopping time for the value investor. In my past few years of research, I have periodically remarked, ""I would like to own that someday at a better price."" Well, for several companies, ""someday"" came during the fourth quarter. I looked at more companies in greater depth in the fourth quarter than I had in the prior two years.Nearly 90% of stocks in the Russell 2000 were down in the fourth quarter. The overall market was down 12 days in a row at one point. Any ""risk"" taking was met with immediate short-term losses. The final competing force is a desire to survive. I don't mean that I have an intense desire to give into panic, sell everything, and hide under the desk. The fund is my largest investment by orders of magnitude comprising a very, very significant portion of my liquid net worth. I want to invest for decades. I want to be thoughtful about the risks we are taking and make sure that we are disproportionately rewarded. I want to seize opportunities, but to survive markets that can be irrational for long periods of time requires not betting the farm, spreading risks, and seeking asymmetric opportunities where the upside is substantially higher than the downside.Hopefully you just read the previous passages and said to yourself, ""shouldn't the desire to hold, the desire to take advantage of opportunity, and a thoughtful assessment of assumed risks be in place at all times?"" They should be… and they are. Our course of action in the fourth quarter resembled that of every other quarter. While the result was more negative, the process and philosophy were exactly the same. We do not have a new strategy. A portfolio built with a five-year time horizon was not completely tossed because of the volatility of the 64 trading days of the fourth quarter. Rather, we completely exited one position as the original thesis appears to be wrong (more on that later), made some adjustments to existing positions, and initiated three new positions, all with different but I believe highly asymmetric return profiles. If I could recreate the asymmetry of the opportunities available to us in Q4 every quarter, we would all benefit enormously. The seeds of future returns have been planted.During the quarter, we initiated a new position in KKR & Co. (NYSE:KKR), an alternative asset manager founded 42 years ago. Under the leadership of Henry Kravis, the firm has evolved from a single buyout fund to a 1,200- employee asset management firm with offices all over the world. I believe KKR has all of the attributes of a great business.High Insider Ownership: The firm is 40% owned by employees.Recurring Revenue: The fund is increasingly focused on ""permanent"" capital. Currently, 9% of capital is permanent and 80% has eight-plus years of duration at inception.Operating Leverage: Incremental margins are exceptionally high in the asset management business, as compensation is the primary variable cost incurred with each incremental dollar of profit.Aligned Incentives: In addition to 40% insider ownership, the firm has more than $10 billion invested alongside clients in KKR funds. Further, more than half of the KKR AUM is eligible to be charged performance fees. Employees do well when clients do well. Shareholders do well when employees and clients do well.Secular Tailwinds: The alternative asset management industry is growing at approximately 12% per year. I believe that the recent declines in public equities will do nothing to slow pension funds, and others that need to show a path to 8+% annual returns, from allocating away from fixed income and towards private equity - there is no end in sight. Assets have flowed disproportionately to the larger firms, and KKR is taking share within private equity, growing assets at 19% per year since 2004.Runway for Growth: KKR has enormous opportunities for growth, particularly in several large markets such as real estate and infrastructure, where the leading players' AUM is 19X and 10X, respectively, the size of KKR's.Under-earning / Investing in the Future: While KKR has been in business for over four decades, the vast majority of its currently funded strategies have been operating for less than one. Infrastructure; energy; U.S., European, and Asian real estate; Tech and Health Care Growth; Private Credit; and U.S. and European Lending are all less than 10 years old. The economics of a strategy can get substantially better over time. The first fund in a strategy is typically smaller and used to build a track record, and its first year is typically a money-losing period as early management fees often do not offset fundraising expenses. If all goes well, there will be some incentive fees, but the amount is often on the small side because the fund is on the small side. The economics get progressively better as a larger second fund is layered in around year four and potentially an even larger fund is layered in around year eight. Eventually, there can be both sizable management and incentive fees from multiple funds in a strategy, with economics that continue to improve as funds age and grow in size. Given the young age of so many funds at KKR, there is the potential for significantly improved economics over time.Differentiated: KKR has the strongest balance sheet of any of the publicly traded PE firms in terms of cash and investments as a % of total market capitalization. This provides downside protection, but also allows KKR to seed funds and provide additional capital to close deals. The firm also has a Capital Markets group which allows KKR to syndicate deals, reduce cost of capital, and optimize monetization strategies, improving returns and likely generating $500M+ in profitable revenue. KKR is one of a handful of private equity firms that can do ""mega deals"" because of their access to capital on the balance sheet as well as the services of their Capital Markets group.We began purchasing shares in the low $20s and ended purchasing shares in the high teens. What did we get for our money? As of the end of Q3 2018, the firm had $195B in assets under management, and an adjusted book value of $16.68 per share.Let's spend a minute on the balance sheet since it is a large part of the investment thesis. KKR's balance sheet as a percentage of equity value is the highest of any publicly traded asset manager, a fact which is often ignored by sell side analysts as it is easier to compare firms on a P/E basis. KKR uses these internal funds to aggressively seed new funds and invest in existing funds. The asymmetry for the KKR investment is created because of the downside protection provided by the balance sheet and the long duration of the capital it manages.KKR's balance sheet has three attractive components: cash ($2.9B or $3.50 per share), investments ($10.2B or $12+/share), and unrealized carried interest ($1.7B or $2 per share). If you are adding up these totals as we go, you get $17.50 on a $20 stock. Sound too good to be true? Well, there are some liabilities and some ""other assets"" so the stated book value per share is $16.68 per share. In addition, these values are all as of September 30th, before the market swoon. Q4 saw large marked-to-market losses on KKR's investments including the largest holding, First Data Corp. (FDC) (14% portfolio weight as of 9/30), which was down 31% in the quarter. The private companies, which are valued using a mix of public company comparables and discounted cash flows (DCFs), presumably fared far better than First Data Corp. Declines in investment value have a secondary effect of also negatively impacting the unrealized carry. The balance sheet has multiple inputs that we cannot estimate with great precision, but when I back out the parts of ""other investments"" that we don't want to own and make estimates for the impact of the decline of the public markets, there is still north of $13 per share in balance sheet that I am happy to own - in fact, more than happy to own. I personally view the investments on the balance sheet as significantly preferable to cash. Employees own 40% of the company; they also own 40% of these investments and have a track record of compounding capital at high rates. This is their capital, and their incentive compensation is driven off of the returns of the funds in which this capital is invested. It is not unreasonable to believe that the balance sheet investments can compound at double-digit rates (with no fees) for the foreseeable future invested alongside KKR managers.For a company with over $13 per share in attractive balance sheet assets, we also get $195B in assets under management (AUM), almost $60B in dry powder (funds that can be called and added to AUM), and a franchise that is growing market share in an industry that is growing. The firm is lengthening the duration of the capital under management, as well as growing total assets. KKR raised $39B in gross capital in 2017 and should have exceeded this number in 2018 (to be confirmed when the final numbers are released). Even with the number of ""young"" funds the company is currently nurturing, they have still generated after-tax distributable earnings of $1.65 in 2016, $1.66 per share in 2017, and are on pace for $2 in 2018. Ex balance sheet, we are paying sub-4X depressed earnings that should grow. The beauty of KKR is that both components of valuation can grow: the investments and the earnings stream.Earlier I mentioned that KKR has grown AUM at a compounded annual rate of 19% over the past 13 years. While there is some lumpiness in incentive fees, management fees are very stable and growing. The setup is reminiscent of our previous holding of Fortress Investment Group (NYSE:FIG), whose balance sheet was ignored during volatile and ""risk off"" periods (link to our thesis).At the KKR investor day (link to presentation), the company laid out a series of reasonable assumptions (slides 22-23) to double earnings and book value in five years as well as reasonable valuation frameworks (slides 239-246) to derive a $40 stock price as of the July presentation date. Now, there are a lot of ifs and assumptions in here, but I consider it to be a very reasonable path to doubling earnings and book value, and with a little multiple expansion from today's very low base, there is a path to a triple or better in less than five years. I can sleep at night because of the protection provided by the balance sheet, but I dream about the growth in AUM and earnings power that may likely come. In my opinion, this is a fantastic business that became very attractively priced as the market ignored the balance sheet, growth prospects, and earning power of the company. Thank you, Mr. Market. Volatility does have its benefits.In the fourth quarter, we invested in the building products distribution company BlueLinx (NYSE:BXC) for the second time. When we initially invested, the thesis (presented in our Q4 2017 letter) was that were shares were cheap due to non-fundamental factors, including the forced sale of 70% of the company by a private equity fund that was at the end of its life. Despite being a long-term oriented investor, I sold the shares relatively quickly for a substantial gain. I had more faith in the discount to asset value (land) at which the company was trading than I had in the ongoing building products distribution business, which is low margin and cyclical: not my favorite combination. In addition, BlueLinx was subscale relative to competitors and I just thought there were better places to put our capital. Thus, as the valuation gap closed and future returns became less about assets and more about the business, we sold.In March 2018, shortly after we sold the shares, BlueLinx bought its competitor Cedar Creek, which had significant overlap in product lines and geographies. The acquisition created much-needed scale, taking the 10th and 11th largest building distribution companies and combining them to become the 6th largest in the nation and the 3rd largest east of the Rockies. The market loved the deal, which was financed with debt, and sent BXC shares from the high teens to the low $40s in a matter of days as analysts clamored over the potential earnings growth. As stand-alone companies, BlueLinx generated $44M in adjusted EBITDA in 2017 and Cedar Creek generated $60M, so just by combining the two and not issuing any shares, the pro forma company would generate more than twice the EBITDA per share. Even more interesting to forward-looking investors, management showed a path to $50M in cost savings by closing facilities, reducing redundant overhead, and improved purchasing enabled by the larger scale. With the cost savings factored in, on a pro forma basis, the combined BlueLinx + Cedar Creek + cost savings would generate more than $150M in cash per year. After paying interest on the debt, taxes, and CapEx, the company estimated the combined entities would generate $75M in excess cash flow per year. With 9.3M shares outstanding, this is more than $8 per share in free cash flow. Even at $40 per share, this translates into a 20% free cash flow yield to the equity, IF the savings could be realized.At its core, BlueLinx is a self-help story about realizing the benefits of an acquisition. Is $50M in savings realistic? It represents a 1.5% improvement in the gross margin and looks very achievable. In fact, it may be conservative. There have been several positive data points since the March acquisition. For example, at every turn management has reiterated this cost saving goal and their ability to achieve it. In fact, on the last quarterly call, in addition to reiterating their confidence, management stated that they were ahead of schedule in terms of realizations, and under budget. Other data points include the CEO of Cedar Creek deciding to join BlueLinx as COO, relocate his family to Atlanta, and tie his entire bonus to the realization of the cost savings. The company has consolidated more than 10 out of 70 facilities and management has made several open market purchases of stock. Collectively, these data points are all incrementally positive.So, what drove the stock from $42 on September 12th to $21 in early December? There are certainly macro concerns about housing, which fared very poorly during the ""great recession."" As a distributor of building products, revenues are clearly tied to construction activity. If one believes that housing starts are going to be depressed for the next five years, BlueLinx is not a stock to own.However, there is a strong argument to be made that there are demographic tailwinds to housing over time. Single-family housing starts in the United States bottomed out in the recession at just below 450,000 per year and have increased to approximately 850,000 in 2018, nine years later. It is estimated that just over 1M single-family homes per year are required to accommodate population growth and replacement from fires, floods, termites etc., so we have been under-producing new houses for the last decade. The surpluses from before the great recession have been absorbed. Can new housing starts pull back for six months or a year? Absolutely. But with the 10-year bond ending 2018 at a multi-month low and unemployment sub-4%, single-family home starts remaining around 850,000 does not feel wildly optimistic.In 2018, virtually all housing-related stocks sold off, it was just a question of how much. For a housing bear, BlueLinx is an interesting target. The company does not screen well for computers, there are no sell side analysts or consensus estimates, and the historical numbers don't capture any of the potential cost savings described above. As a result of the Cedar Creek acquisition, which has the potential to be wonderful in the long term, current debt has increased dramatically and large one-time expenses are being incurred to close redundant facilities and merge operations. Many of the machines may not factor in the qualitative attributes that attract me. Short interest increased dramatically in the fourth quarter as the BXC price declined. Score one for the machines.BXC short sellers likely focus on the headline debt figures. Following the Cedar Creek acquisition, BlueLinx balance sheet has almost $600M of debt between a $179M term loan and a $415M asset-backed loan (real estate and inventory). On a trailing 12-month basis, the company has generated $80M of adjusted EBITDA. In other words, the stated debt is more than 7X the trailing EBITDA. Neither machines nor humans like low margin, cyclical business with minimal debt coverage.Let's take a minute and look at the balance sheet more closely. There is more than $400M in inventory and $285M in receivables against the previously mentioned $594MM in debt plus $153M in accounts payable. The company is in the process of closing more than 10 distribution centers (out of 70). They have not guided to any reduction in inventory, but it certainly would not surprise me to see the inventory decline and thus reduce the level of the asset- backed loan. There is also an opportunity to shift dollars owed from the asset-backed loan to accounts payable, effectively letting vendors provide more financing. Will the money still be owed? Yes, but it will likely improve how the company screens. The company is also selling two newly-closed redundant facilities that are expected to fetch in excess of $25M. Further, just operating the business will reduce the leverage. The asset sales, inventory reduction, vendor financing, and cash generation from the business should reduce the asset-backed loan by well over $100M (and possibly significantly more) in 2019. While the headline debt appears high, given all of the offsetting and liquid assets - and with the receivables and inventory - the risks of distress are far more remote than the debt to EBITDA coverage ratio would imply.The third factor likely driving the decline in the BXC share price was exposure to the price of lumber, which is volatile and can be driven by macro fears about future housing demand as well as different trade policies. I am by no means an expert in the lumber market and I don't have a view on where it is headed. Over the course of the third quarter, the price of lumber effectively went straight down: a once-in-every-four-years type of move. The fear was this would lead to depressed earnings. Even though the company only carries about 30 days of inventory of commodity goods like plywood, they were losing money on sales since they had paid higher prices for the inventory but were forced to adjust their customer prices to market prices. Management spent a disproportionate amount of time discussing lumber prices on their conference call as investors were clearly focused on it. From my perspective, lumber will go up and down over a three- to five-year timeframe, but it will not be the driving factor in the success of the BlueLinx business or our investment. Machines and investors focused on quarterly earnings can obsess over commodity prices. The company just weathered a once-in-five-years negative move in lumber; this should not be our focus.Yes, BlueLinx's fortunes are in part tied to new house construction, but the non-cyclical ""self-help"" earnings improvements and the nature of the balance sheet provide downside protection. In a softer new home building market, the company would reduce inventory, thus reducing debt levels. In addition, the company can continue to do sale leasebacks of owned properties. If housing starts were to go down 20%, BlueLinx would likely remain profitable and continue to reduce debt. Bankruptcy is far more remote of an event than a simple historical debt/EBITDA calculation would indicate. This is not to say that the share price cannot decline (this was an $8 stock not too long ago), but I believe that on a risk adjusted basis, there is substantially more upside than downside embedded in the prices, even factoring in the cyclicality and debt.Carved into the Mount Rushmore of special-situation investing is Joel Greenblatt, author of ""You Can be a Stock Market Genius,"" former manager of Gotham Capital (which returned over 40% annually for almost two decades), and professor of the hardest class to get into at Columbia Business School. I believe BlueLinx has many of the attributes of a Greenblatt special situation: no sell side analysts, moving parts, insider buying, distorted financial statements, and asymmetry. Perhaps we should not be surprised that the godfather himself was rumored to have attended BlueLinx's annual meeting. I suspect that he approves of BXC. If housing is stable, there is a clear path to a triple. If housing improves or the savings come in better than expected… Thank you, Mr. Market and your machine friends.During Q4, Greenhaven invested in Radisson Hotels AB (STO:RADH), a Swedish-listed equity that provides ownership in the European operations of Radisson Hotels. In August, a deal was announced for Chinese conglomerate Jin Jiang to acquire a majority stake in RADH. Without muddling this letter with all of the game theory and intricacies of Swedish takeover law, when we bought our initial shares at 36 kroner, there was a virtually guaranteed forthcoming offer of 35 kroner to all shareholders and reasons to believe it could be substantially higher (3% downside/20%+ upside). When we bought our second and larger tranche of shares, the price was at just over 40 kroner, keeping pace with Jin Jiang's revised offer of 40 kroner/share with the possibility of a substantially higher bid (1/2% downside/20% upside). In early January, Jin Jang came back with a final bid of 42.50 kroner, which was not as high as I believed possible but generated a double-digit return for Greenhaven with very little risk and in just a few weeks. I would invest in this type of situations - less than 1% downside for significant upside - all day every day if I could. We have reinvested the capital into a new position to be discussed in the next letter.Any confidence that I had in predicting how a Chinese conglomerate would navigate Swedish M&A law was made possible by Brad Hathaway of Far View Capital, in which the Greenhaven Road Partners Fund is invested. Brad presented Radisson Hotels at a Partners Fund dinner early last year, long before Jin Jiang and Greenhaven Road became attracted to the opportunity.Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) - We can add Fiat Chrysler to the long list of companies whose short-term stock price movements bear little relationship to the current operations or future earnings of the company. FCAU stock declined 15% in the quarter despite announcing the long-anticipated sale of the parts division, which contributed roughly 10% of EBITDA for 30% of the value of the company… despite announcing strong U.S. unit volumes every month during the quarter (+15%, +16%, +17%)… despite unveiling the Gladiator, a new Jeep pickup truck (a white space product) that has gotten rave reviews and will likely generate strong margins and profits when it goes on sale in 2019).Going forward, FCAU will have a very strong balance sheet post-sale of the Magneti Marelli parts division. Net of cash, the stock is trading sub 2X EBIT after taking share last year with the new Ram pickup and continued growth in Jeep. I had hopes for a tender offer of shares after the Magneti Marelli sale. That has not yet materialized, but the sale is not expected to close until Q2 2019. Despite all of the negative headlines, the U.S. auto market actually grew in 2018. There has been a prolonged pause in the share price of FCAU, but there has been robust growth in earnings power and net cash on the balance sheet. Fundamentals will matter again. The Agnelli family controls this business. They have a generational timeline, not a quarterly one. Eventually, the gap will close between price and value, and when it does, we are not playing for a 5% move.Radisson Hospitality AB - Discussed above.Box, Inc. (NYSE:BOX) - was a new position last quarter (link to our Q3 letter). The combination of very low churn (sub 5% per year), a large attractive customer base (69% of the Fortune 500), a pipeline of new very high margin products to sell into this base of customers, and an undemanding valuation provides an interesting set-up for acquisition or long-term compounding.SharpSpring (NASDAQ:SHSP) - This SAAS business sells marketing automation tools, acquiring customers at a fraction of their expected long term value (LTV/CAC > 6) with a flagship product that is growing well in excess of 40% per year and a long runway for growth.Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) - This is a healthy two-sided marketplace with improving economics driven by pricing changes that will better monetize the existing traffic. Management is investing in growth, improving the user experience for shoppers and the tools for sellers. We trimmed our position during Q4 because it is the highest multiple stock in our portfolio as well as the most susceptible to multiple compression. Etsy is also one of the best businesses that we own and is carving out a nice position as an alternative to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).The fund remains short ETFs targeted at short-term traders, a bond fund where the underlying interest rates received relative to the risk assumed do not pass my common-sense test, and two indices. One of the benefits of the volatility is that the persistent, across-the-board upward march of all stocks has ended and we now have a far better environment for short selling. While we will undoubtedly remain a very long biased fund, it would not surprise me if we added a few shorts over the coming quarters.I make it a practice to inform the partnership of significant new purchases in these letters. I want you to have a sense of what we own and why we own it, thus providing context to our historical and future returns. I tend not to highlight when we exit a company. However, in the case of Yelp (NYSE:YELP), I think it is instructive. Yelp was a top five position for multiple quarters and I spent a fair amount of time in the previous letters explaining how I thought a tweak to their business model - getting rid of one-year contracts for advertisers - would increase trial of their product and ultimately grow their base of advertisers. The thesis passed a common-sense test and, in fact, the company was experiencing growth on a year-over-year basis as well as on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Given the operating leverage in the Yelp business model, I was quite excited by the possibility of sustained growth.What happened? When Yelp reported their quarterly results, their paying advertiser accounts did not grow. They had 194,000 paying advertisers on June 30 and 194,000 on September 30. Not growing for one quarter is not a reason in itself to sell an investment we entered with a three- to five-year time horizon. However, in the context of a company that just made trying the product easier, it was disconcerting to see no growth at all in the number of advertisers. Management cited some operational issues that may in fact reverse themselves, and exiting maybe an over-reaction, but I just could not get over the fact that the advertiser count stayed flat despite the term changes and the activity of Yelp's sales force, which totals over 3,000 people. So even with easier selling terms, three thousand salespeople could not grow the number of advertisers. It took that many people to just replace the advertisers that were leaving. Again, the issues at Yelp maybe temporary, and the Yelp valuation is not demanding, but 3,000+ salespeople running around, meeting business owners, and making phone calls to sell a more consumable package ending that quarter with a net result of no growth in advertisers does not give me cheery thoughts. Ultimately, the thesis that changing the contract terms will have great long-term benefits for the company may be true, but in the intermediate term, there are real product and execution risks.We expect to have K1s ready by the first week of March.

Our government is not functioning, literally not functioning, as we continue to experience the longest government shutdown in our nation's history. Just about every financial headline is negative. We have the seemingly contradictory narrative of ""interest rates are rising; this is going to kill the economy"" as well as ""interest rates are falling because the economy is weakening."" Of course, implied by both of those headlines is that the economy is currently strong, but that is rarely explicitly stated.The fourth quarter saw the return of the +2% or -2% day in the market with the S&P 500's average daily move exceeding 1% per day. In reality, the fortunes of the companies we are investing in are not rising and falling by 1% per day. The future cash flows of Box are not declining by 1%, 2% or more because of a single tweet emanating from the White House. My job is to make sure we do not conflate negative short-term results with a broken process.In my opinion, there are macro headwinds and multiples may compress, but there are also great companies like KKR that that will adapt and prosper. We only need to find a couple a year and hold on through the noise. Just as I ended the last letter - as volatility arises, I will attempt to take advantage of the opportunities it creates. We will continue to invest with a long time horizon, and we will continue to invest like it is our own money - because it is.

4253075,105172,2019-04-05T18:59:00-04:00,"Yelp is valued for considerable growth, yet its core business is shrinking, and it recently reported its first slowdown in paid accounts.Because Google can solicit reviews on its many platforms, such as Maps, it's now generating significantly more ratings and reviews than Yelp.In a business reliant on network effects such as crowd-sourced reviews, Google may quickly leave Yelp obsolete.Yelp recently highlighted its new revenue growth plan, to focus on large advertisers such as McDonald's, ignoring the reality that people do not need Yelp to find a Big Mac.Yelp is at an inflection point. Could the market be a little too optimistic?","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) currently trades at a PE ratio of close to ~60X and is guiding for significant growth in the coming years. This is despite its core business deteriorating, its first slowdown in paid accounts, and increased competition from Google (GOOG) (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN). A business centered around crowdsourced reviews lives and dies by network effects. As Google generates a substantially greater number of reviews, from a much more diverse reviewer base, the Yelp platform is quickly becoming obsolete.To achieve its desired growth, Yelp announced a substantial change to its business model: A shift in focus to large corporate advertisers, a radical departure from its current focus on small businesses. This is a real moon shot that's not likely to succeed and may cannibalize their existing business.Also, this is from the landing page of Yelp for business owners, is this what $213M of annual product design gets you? Sometimes, frequently, or almost always? Any idea what that means?Yelp reports its user metrics in three categories:Desktop, Mobile, and Mobile Application. A user is any unique click in a given month averaged over the reporting period. These are not daily users.Desktop = Q4 2017: ~77 million, Q4 2018: ~62 million = -15 millionMobile = Q4 2017: ~64 million, Q4 2018: ~69 million = +5 millionMobile App = Q4 2017: ~29 million, Q4 2018: ~33 million = +4 millionAll data from Yelp's quarterly filingsWhile mobile and app users are growing slightly, they do not offset the large decline in desktop users. (Yelp relies on Google analytics to measure the number of desktop users and blames some of this decline on Google's elimination of spam clicks. But at -15 million, it certainly seems that the user base is shrinking.)When assessing the growing app user base, it's important to note that Yelp mobile has a forced download policy. This means that anyone who googles a restaurant on a mobile device, and then scrolls down to click on a restaurant's Yelp listing, will not be able to read the reviews without first downloading the Yelp app. This is important for a couple of reasons. First, app downloads generally imply an engaged user base that's interested enough to download the app. However, this is not an accurate assumption for Yelp users. Many users only download the app to finish the immediate task they began with their mobile Google search. Secondly, many of these users may be double counted as both a mobile user and a mobile app user, even just to finish one task. (Thirdly, Yelp counts their mobile users in-house, and includes the following disclaimer in their filings: ""Our metrics may be affected by mobile applications that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with no discernible user action involved; this activity can cause our system to count the device associated with the app as an app unique device in a given period."" There are numerous scenarios that could conceivably inflate this number, such as a third party using Yelp's APIs to crawl for data from reviews, that then appear as a ""unique device user."" Yelp denies that this is a likely scenario. They monitor this closely and claim to use this same reported number to make internal investment decisions. But as mobile users stagnate and shrink, forced downloads will be harder to accomplish.)Q3 2018 was the first quarter that Yelp reported no growth in paid accounts (steady at 194,000). Q4 2018 was the first quarter that paid accounts actually shrank (from 194,000 to 191,000).Why is this so important?A. Because this is despite ~4,000 high pressured commission incentivized sales reps - the churn has to be phenomenal!B. And, despite (or maybe because of) Yelp offering businesses the option to try Yelp advertising without locking in a long-term contract.This means that businesses are increasingly finding that Yelp advertising is not cost-effective.In 2018, Yelp reported net income of $55 million on revenue of $940 million with a whopping total of $480 million spent on sales and marketing. For every dollar in ad revenue, Yelp spent more than 50 cents to sell it. This is rather amazing, considering Yelp's business and growth stage (Google spends less than 12 cents on the dollar).Yelp also announced that, by year end, instead of reporting paid accounts, they will switch to reporting paid locations. This means that if they acquire a chain with 30 restaurants as an advertiser, instead of the entire chain counting as one account, it will now reflect the true nature of the many business locations. This change is necessary when you consider the new business model that Yelp has announced, a switch in focus from small businesses to larger chains such as McDonald's (MCD), and Yelp's disinterest in continuing to report a shrinking paid accounts number.As Jed Nachman (COO of Yelp) mentioned in the latest earnings call,The problem is we do not know how exactly they plan on ""attacking"" it and why they think they'll succeed against Google. When attracting big box ad dollars, there are two important considerations - both of which Yelp is notoriously shady about: A great ad product and great attribution products. In other words, a competitive ROI and a way for the businesses to verify it. Yelp is infamously known to be way behind the competition. Many businesses are clueless on how to build a good Yelp ad, and most importantly, how well they actually perform. In fact, in the conference call, Nachman basically admits as much. After explaining how the first order of business is building a new sales team (scary), he touches on the real issue,Yelp has long been able to get by with little to show in the way of ROI as they have a high-pressure sales team interacting with clueless and scared small business owners who have zero leverage. More on this later. (In fact, even ""link tracking"" is only available to businesses with 10 or more locations!)Nachman then continues:The problem is that this ignores the reality of the platform. Yelp is a platform built around small businesses. No one needs to log into Yelp to click on an ad for a local McDonald's or to find out what a Starbucks (SBUX) latte tastes like. Additionally, big box ads further erode the value proposition for the existing small business clientele.So, why the change of focus? The answer may lie in some interesting statements from their latest filings:But wait:The much larger looming issue is Google. This is no secret, and Jeremy Stoppelman (founder and CEO of Yelp) has been on a campaign for years against the antitrust ills of big tech and specifically Google's ""malicious"" anticompetitive behavior.Watch Jeremy Stoppelman battling Google on 60 minutesIt has long been obvious that if Google chooses to act improperly and demote Yelp in search, Yelp would quickly die. But it now appears that Yelp is struggling to maintain its key position in Google search results, even with Google playing fair. As Jeremy has said many times, when you can't make the first page on Google, it's game over. Google also has a key advantage when it comes to tackling one of the largest problems with online reviews, and the most common complaint regarding the Yelp platform: A negative reviewer bias and the reciprocal fake reviews generated by business owners.Customers rarely write reviews for an average or even a positive experience. It's much more likely for someone to go out of their way to complain then to praise. This leaves businesses extremely frustrated. They then ask friends or loyal customers to generate ""positive feedback,"" or what Yelp calls ""fake reviews."" In an opaque process, Yelp monitors reviews and reviewers to weed out the suspicious reviews. It then deletes or demotes these reviews to a hidden page. This leaves many business listings with a skewed representation of the business - largely composed of negative reviews and ""real reviews"" written by ""seasoned Yelpers."" Seasoned Yelpers have reviewed often enough that Yelp can verify they are real. Yelp then promotes these reviews. This is why Yelp users have become accustomed to reading long drawn out ""articles"" more closely resembling creative writing and food blog posts than actual customer reviews. Along the way, the most valuable aspect of an online crowdsourced review platform - the opinion of the average consumer - is lost. This has been true since Yelp's inception. But now, Google has finally figured out a way to make it work for regular people.Google has the ability to solicit a rating (and review) from regular customers in a manner in which they agree to give feedback. They do this by making it simple to leave a solicited review. Think Uber or Lyft, where when prompted, riders actually leave a rating or review. Google has this ability because it already has users on its platforms. For example, on Google Maps, Google now prompts users to leave a rating or review after users visit a location. Additionally, Google has many multiples of user data, which allows Google to effectively weed out fake reviews, and even more importantly, let the real ones remain.This is indeed what's happening! In many categories of business, Google is receiving more than four times the number of reviews than Yelp (often much higher). And, in a network effects business, it's easy to imagine how this plays out.I would be remiss discussing Yelp without discussing the largest and fastest-growing segment - home and local. Over the years, Yelp claims to have been innovating in this category with products like ""Request-a-Quote."" The problem is it's very difficult to imagine Yelp winning, and home and local is extremely reliant on Google. This is from Yelp's latest filing,And even more importantly, both Google and Amazon are now directly competing with Yelp for these clicks. Both Google and Amazon now offer money-back guarantees for the servicers they connect customers with. It's very tough to compete with that.Additionally, I spoke with a typical home servicer (locksmith) who is familiar with many small local business owners in similar categories across multiple geographic locations. He informed me that everyone in the business knows that if you do not buy advertising, Yelp removes positive reviews. I informed him that it's not true, and that Yelp vehemently denies this. He was shocked Yelp would say such a thing - ""everyone in the business believes they do."" This leads me to the most well-known and controversial criticism of Yelp.Small business owners purchase Yelp ads out of fear that their page will be penalized (that Yelp will remove positive reviews), and not out of a clear ROI using the platform. (This also helps explain the ridiculous sales and marketing budget.) Yelp has been vehemently denying this for years and has even won a lawsuit and survived a related FTC investigation. But its team of ~4,000 high-pressured commission-incentivized sales reps has convinced business owners otherwise. And, whether or not Yelp penalizes business owners who choose not to advertise is not what matters. What matters is that business owners believe that they do. Because many business owners see little in the way of genuine ROI, when they realize that Google is increasingly what matters, they will be quick to rid of their Yelp ""protection"" payments.Perhaps, some of the overpromising of future growth is a response to the recent SQN activist campaign. (SQN Investors LP is a technology-focused investment firm with more than $1.1 billion under management that maintains a large position in Yelp and believes Yelp is significantly undervalued.) SQN threatened to replace board members and ultimately put Yelp up for sale if management didn't make significant changes. SQN put together a long letter that reads like a great short presentation, illustrating the mismanagement and underperformance of Yelp to date. SQN then laid out a very rosy path toward future growth, but little in the way of realistic measures to achieve it. (This includes a renewed focus on partnerships and perhaps finding a miracle that's willing to pay double the ridiculously inflated current market cap. Should Yelp find such strategic partners, perhaps, Yelp could return to rapid growth. Yelp's value, though, as a strategic partner is its existing platform that's in danger as users choose to use Google.) Yelp responded to SQN and made great promises that after a one-year slowdown, focused on investment and inflection, it will return to rapid growth. SQN then backed off and said the following:It is interesting to note SQN has maintained a large position in Stamps.com as well. It was pretty clear that Stamps.com was a disaster - for a very obvious reason: They don't deserve to exist. It's a simple and easily replicable platform with one (debatably several) shippers (essentially USPS) who can easily squeeze margins or drop the intermediate leech whenever they choose. This is what happened - causing the stock to drop more than 50% overnight. Perhaps, the market will soon realize the existential threat Yelp faces as well."

In Yelp's most recent quarter, revenue growth jumped from 5% y/y to 9% y/y.This improvement indicates a huge step toward Yelp's goal. The biggest driver behind the growth spurt is a focus on national, multi-location clients, a segment expected to grow >20% y/y.Yelp is also relocating a good portion of its sales teams outside of San Francisco, alongside several other cost-saving initiatives that are expected to drive EBITDA improvements.","This article was highlighted for PRO+ subscribers, Seeking Alpha’s service for professional investors. Find out how you can get access to the best content on Seeking Alpha here.In the midst of many more exciting companies in the Internet sector, very few investors still want to have a conversation about Yelp (YELP). That's unfortunate, because amidst a heated market, Yelp remains one of the few diamonds in the rough that is executing a bona fide turnaround in its core business while still retaining a tremendous value proposition.Suffice to say that Yelp has severely underperformed the market during the breathtaking rally of 2019 and January 2020. Since the start of 2019, Yelp shares are about flat while the S&P 500 has surged 32%:Data by YChartsNow of course, stock price underperformance in any given period is no guarantee of a future bounce-back. But fundamental turnarounds are. Yelp's management has openly acknowledged that performance has been lagging over the past year, and have identified concrete actions to turn the business around.Since I last wrote on Yext several months ago, the company has released a new set of quarterly earnings that show tremendous progress toward the company's turnaround goals. When these targets were issued last quarter, many investors may have dismissed them as pie-in-the-sky goals - but now with actual improvement in revenue and continued progress on EBITDA, it's becoming more difficult to justify the discount at which Yelp trades to the broader market. The company's 8.3x forward EBITDA multiple and 1.9x forward revenue multiple, in my view, is tremendously light for a company that plans on growing both EBITDA and revenue in the mid-teens in the current calendar year.Data by YChartsFor all the talk that Yelp is a ""legacy"" technology company, simply consider the fact that Yelp still has leading mind-share among consumers. Yelp is often the most-frequented website for restaurant reviews. Besides this core category, Yelp is also the most prominent source of information and reviews on a wide array of local businesses, from plumbers to notaries. Though advertising performance has been lackluster in 2018 and 2019, Yelp has a strong, well-trafficked platform with which to reinvigorate revenue growth in 2020. Stay long on this name and wait for the rebound.In Yelp's most recent quarterly update (Q3), the company provided two important updates:See the company's Q3 performance below; note that revenue of $262.5 million was slightly ahead of Wall Street's consensus of $262.0 million:Figure 1. Yelp Q3 revenue resultsSource: Yelp Q3 earnings releaseBut even more importantly than Yelp's Q3 results, the company has continued to forecast to accelerating revenue growth, echoing the promise it has made for long-term growth. In Q4, Yelp expects revenue growth to clock in at +11-13% y/y.Of course, revenue growth doesn't just materialize out of thin air. There's a very tangible driver behind this improved performance: multi-location customers - aka, the national franchises that most of us are familiar with. Though Yelp has historically been focused on local businesses, it has more recently shifted its sales efforts to advertising partners with much larger, national footprints.Several metrics highlight the benefits of focusing on multi-location customers. Key among them, in my view, is the fact that Yelp sales reps dedicated to multi-location customers generate 5x+ the revenue of a local rep, as shown in the infographic below:Figure 2. Yelp multi-location focusSource: Yelp Q3 earnings presentationThis ""untapped"" market for multi-location clients is the single biggest driver of Yelp's planned double-digit revenue growth through 2023. As seen in the chart below, Yelp's local SMB clients are only expected to generate ~10% y/y revenue growth through 2023. What gives Yelp the ability to generate mid-teens growth, however, is the fact that multi-location clients are expected to grow at >20% y/y.Figure 3. Yelp customer segment revenue mixSource: Yelp Q3 earnings presentationThis >20% y/y revenue growth is already present in Yelp's current results. In Q3, multi-location client revenue grew 21% y/y, consistent with Q2's growth rate.Many older technology companies, in the face of flagging growth, choose to re-accelerate revenue growth by pressing on the gas pedal on the sales and marketing front. The same is not true of Yelp: in addition to committing to mid-teens revenue growth, the company also has a long-term goal of hitting an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 30-35%, up from 22% in the current quarter.The primary vehicle to achieve this is re-thinking the company's sales org. Instead of piling on more sales reps to generate more revenue, as previously noted, the company has chosen to focus on higher-impact multi-location sales reps. The chart below shows Yelp's key plans for improving margins:Figure 4. Yelp profitability initiativesSource: Yelp Q3 earnings presentationKey takeaways from above: despite a goal to deliver higher revenue growth, Yelp plans to keep local sales headcount flat. In addition, the company is moving a good chunk of its sales force out of expensive San Francisco and into cheaper markets, which is expected to save $10 million annually (which at Yelp's current revenue scale represents approximately 1 point of additional EBITDA margin). Other reductions in marketing and corporate expenses are expected to drive further optimization to EBITDA.As with Yelp's revenue growth targets, the company's EBITDA goals are not simply pie-in-the-sky targets - Yelp has already shown momentum toward these targets. In Q3, Yelp grew adjusted EBITDA at 16% y/y to $58.3 million, while EBITDA margins rose one point from the prior year:Figure 5. Yelp adj. EBITDA trendsSource: Yelp Q3 earnings releaseThis EBITDA improvement is expected to continue in full force in Q4, where the company has committed to 2-3 points of margin expansion.Yelp is a company without hubris. Management has acknowledged the company's deficiencies that has dragged down Yelp's share price and have taken steps toward correcting fundamental performance. In my view, Yelp is heavily undervalued at its current ~8x/2x EBITDA/revenue multiple, if the company really does manage to achieve mid-teens growth in both EBITDA and revenue (which current-quarter evidence suggests is wholly possible).Yelp has also taken advantage of its sluggish share price to execute a large swath of buybacks. Since the beginning of 2019, Yext has plunged nearly half a billion dollars into share buybacks and reduced its outstanding share count by 14%.Yext will report fourth-quarter results and issue its all-important FY20 guidance in mid-February. Investors won't have to wait long for the rebound in this name."
4271829,103480,2019-06-24T12:46:16-04:00,"Yelp is trading near 52-week lows, ever since revenue growth decelerated sharply in the earnings quarter it reported in May.Yelp remains one of the cheapest stocks in the internet sector, trading at just under 2x forward revenues.The company has announced its intention to return to mid-teens revenue growth next year, driven by accelerating performance in key categories like Home while also rolling out new products.Yelp has also managed to drive EBITDA margin gains by keeping a laser focus on cost controls.","In a year where most internet and software stocks have rebounded sharply after caving from December lows, Yelp (YELP) seems to have dug itself deeper into its hole. No matter how much sway the popular reviews site has with consumers, Yelp just can't seem to catch a break with investors. Year to date, Yelp is down 5%, badly trailing the double-digit gains of the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ:Data by YChartsIn my view, Yelp remains a terrific stock for value investors. Over the past year, Yelp has had a monetization issue, with fierce competition in online advertising from the twin duopoly of Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) crowding out its platform. But despite this, Yelp remains an ever-popular consumer site for checking restaurant reviews. And, beyond its core category of restaurants, Yelp has also evolved into virtually the only trusted site to check reviews for local businesses such as plumbers and painters. Over time, Yelp's clout with consumers should allow the company to find stable footing on the revenue side.Yelp has acknowledged its issues and is working to reinvigorate its performance. With shares trading so cheaply, investors should dive in and wait for the rebound.In May, Yelp reaffirmed its guidance targets both for the current year and for the long term. Yelp's outlook, in my view, is far more rosy than its stock price would have you believe. Here's a look at the company's FY19 forecast:Figure 1. Yelp FY19 guidance outlookSource: Yelp Q1 shareholder letterYelp's revenue growth range of 8-10% y/y already represents a respectable pickup from Q1's growth rate of 6% y/y - effectively, the company is saying that it has initiatives in place to accelerate its revenue growth (we'll cover Yelp's key winning areas in the next section). At the midpoint of that range, Yelp is forecasting 9% y/y growth to $1.028 billion in revenues.At Yelp's present share price of ~$33, the company trades at a market cap of $2.56 billion. If we net out the $698.2 million of net cash on Yelp's balance sheet (the company has no debt), we arrive at an enterprise value of $1.86 billion. This implies that Yelp is trading at a bargain-basement valuation of 1.81x EV/FY19 revenues.Aside from guiding to a pickup in revenue growth, Yelp is also forecasting two to three points of EBITDA margin improvement, as seen in the table above. Unlike the company's revenue forecast, we've already seen evidence of this EBITDA improvement in Q1, where EBITDA margins ticked up from 15% in the prior year to 17% this year. This was heavily driven by a reduction in sales and marketing spend as a percentage of revenues. As Yelp grows into its scale, it has also captured on sales efficiencies, and the company plans to reduce its sales footprint in its expensive home city of San Francisco this year:Figure 3. Yelp sales and marketing as a percentage of revenues, 1Q19Source: Yelp Q1 shareholder letterIf we assume a two-point improvement from FY18's 19% EBITDA margin this year, we arrive at an adjusted EBITDA outlook of $216 million, indicating that Yelp is also trading at a very light multiple of 8.6x EV/FY19 EBITDA.Yelp's low valuation looks even better when we look further out into the future. Management has acknowledged that the company is currently in a rut, but has planned an aggressive recovery in the future, with revenue growth recovering to the mid-teens and adjusted EBITDA margins nearly doubling from present levels:Figure 3. Yelp long-term targetsSource: Yelp Q1 earnings deckOf course, any company can draw up a rosy long-term forecast, but we need to dive into the drivers of that growth. With Yelp, we can point to several catalysts that can reinvigorate the company's growth back into the mid-teens levels.Within existing categories, Yelp has made a big deal out of reservations as of late. Building on the historical strength of its Restaurants category, Yelp has made an aggressive push into reservations, and the number of diners seated through Yelp Reservations and NoWait has multiplied:Figure 4. Yelp Reservations metricsSource: Yelp Q1 shareholder letterThe company also notched a record number of food orders placed through Yelp, thanks to its partnership with Grubhub (GRUB).Home is another winning vertical for Yelp, and the company reported that this category grew more than four times faster than all of Yelp's other categories combined. Yelp also reported that its relatively new ""Request-a-Quote"" feature for home projects saw a 26% y/y increase and led to 5 million fresh leads for Yelp advertisers. Yelp also noted that paid leads in the Home category will double in FY19 relative to FY18.Existing categories aside, Yelp has also invested some muscle into rolling out several new products for its business advertisers. One of the key offerings here is ""Verified License,"" which allows participating businesses to showcase a blue certification stamp on their Yelp landing page. Since launching this offering six months ago, 5,000 businesses have signed up. Yelp has also rolled out an offering called Business Highlights, which allows participating advertisers to showcase a certain attribute of their business such as ""free estimates.""While rollouts like these seem simple, they are terrific, greenfield sources of incremental revenue, and the primary driver behind Yelp's expected revenue acceleration in the back half of this year. Note also that Yelp has stepped up its win rates among larger brands, what it calls ""national and multi-location"" advertisers. Revenue from these advertisers grew 22% y/y - needless to say, much faster than Yelp's overall 6% y/y revenue growth. Yelp has also dramatically increased the size of its enterprise sales teams, bumping up headcount by 30% since the beginning of the year. Yelp also reported that revenue from its top 100 advertisers grew 50% y/y in 1Q19, and that this cohort of customers increased their 2018 spending levels by 30%.Yelp has a powerful narrative behind it: key existing categories like Reservations and Homes are experiencing tremendous growth, while newer offerings as well as enterprise sales are expected to see a pickup in the back half of the year. Yelp's current pain is short term, and if we believe in the success of these initiatives, then we'll also see accelerated revenue growth and significant adjusted EBITDA margin improvement in FY19 and beyond.There's no doubt that Yelp is a rebound story - but with the stock trading at such modest multiples of both revenue and adjusted EBITDA, the company's risk-reward profile heavily favors bulls. Stay long here."
4291528,22148,2019-09-13T19:58:36-04:00,"Groupon is apparently kicking the tires on acquiring Yelp.The combined entity would offer EBITDA potential in the $700 million range with an EV of only $3.5 billion.Yelp remains on pace for 10% revenue growth and not in the position of needing a merger.Yelp trades below 10x EBITDA targets, making the stock a steal at current prices.","The WSJ reported that Groupon (GRPN) potentially wants to buy Yelp (YELP) to create a site that matches consumer reviews with deal offers, leading to a more transactional services business for customers. My previous research already highlighted how Yelp is a money machine so the company should cautiously consider a premium offer from Groupon or any other potential acquirer. Apparently, activist investors are pressuring Groupon management to make an aggressive move for the beleaguered company to gain some momentum. An apparent target according to the WSJ is an acquisition of Yelp. Both companies are cash rich so the question is best how to develop a successful and rewarding business model and utilize the excess cash to reward shareholders. Groupon can use the cash to either purchase another company or continue repurchasing shares at a more aggressive rate, but neither will solve the weak business climate for online deals. Groupon has $600 million in cash on the balance sheet and generated $93 million in free cash flow in the last year. With a stock valuation of $1.7 billion, a quick $170 million share buyback would repurchase up to 10% of the outstanding stock. One only has to look at the revenues estimates for the next couple of years to see where the problem lies with Groupon. Repurchasing shares is unlikely to move the stock when revenues are targeted to flatline through 2021 and the trend has been consistent cuts to revenue expectations. Groupon needs to invest in the business to reinvigorate growth and utilize a customer base of 200 million app downloads. Enter Yelp into the picture where some logic exists for a combination that could potentially better attack a combined business focus on local. The WSJ even suggests the combined entity would generate an adjusted EBITDA target of $900 million to $1 billion via up to $200 million in synergies. The 2019 projections don't add up so the companies would need EBITDA growth in 2020 and beyond to reach such a target:Groupon has a market value of $1.7 billion and Yelp is currently at $2.6 million for a combined new entity valuation of $4.3 billion. On the surface, investors can clearly see how nearly $700 million in EBITDA could generate some serious stock gains from the current market valuations. An EBITDA target of $1 billion appears very aggressive. The companies would have a cash balance in excess of $1 billion with only Groupon having convertible debt of $200 million. Based on these numbers, Yelp would clearly have to review the transaction. Any concept that would help drive growth would be a home run for the combination, but the Groupon business remains a drag on the stock until resolved. Yelp has a solidly growing business and an undervalued stock. The company doesn't need Groupon and clearly doesn't want to take the business model that would slow down growth rates. Analysts appear confident that Yelp will grow revenues at a 10% clip over the next couple of years. In the process, the consumer review site expects to grow EBITDA margins with a goal of reaching over 30% from a current level in the 22% range. At a revenue base of $1.5 billion, Yelp could generate up to $450 million in positive EBITDA. With an EV closer to $2.2 billion after stripping out a cash balance of $458 million, Yelp would only trade at about 5x such an EBITDA target of $450 million down the road. The biggest issue is the Groupon deals model is dead with no growth opportunities. Yelp would likely be better off working with Groupon on a partnership to offer their deals via transactions on the Yelp website and via the mobile app.In addition, the WSJ highlights that Groupon is down 38% since the CEO took over in November 2015. Yelp has struggled for years, but the shareholder base sure doesn't want to move to a worse management team. The key investor takeaway is that a deal by where Groupon acquires Yelp appears highly unlikely. The combination of the two companies has some logic and value creation properties, but the combined business needs a catalyst for higher stock prices other than the value proposition of a cheap stock with tons of EBITDA generation and a large cash balance."

We invest only in our very best ideas – typically 15 long positions or less and a handful of opportunistic short positions.Generally avoiding commodity-based companies, we look for businesses with strong cash flow, normalized earnings, and long term growth horizons.Includes detailed analysis of Greenhaven Road Capital's positions in ETSY, FCAU, SHSP, TRIP, YELP, EVI, BOX.In the third quarter, the partnership had positive net returns of approximately 3%, which brings year to date returns in excess of 12% net of all fees and expenses.","Original PostGreenhaven Road Capital commentary for the third quarter ended September 31, 2018 discussing the good and the bad business problems.Dear Fellow Investors,In the third quarter, the partnership had positive net returns of approximately 3%, which brings year to date returns in excess of 12% net of all fees and expenses. Individual returns will vary by investor class, so please check your statements. This marks our tenth straight quarter of positive returns. Let me assure you, this is not by design.In fact, if this past quarter had ended a few days later, our modest gains would have turned into losses. I am looking for out of favor and misunderstood companies with a multi-year time horizon. As a concentrated, long biased partnership, we will have down months, quarters, and years. The returns should not be linear, but with a little good fortune, over time we can continue to compound our capital at attractive rates.There are good businesses and bad businesses. Similarly, there are good business problems and bad business problems. Bad business problems include disadvantaged cost structures and overcapitalized competitors who can sustain years of losses in the pursuit of market share. Good business problems include the inability to satisfy demand. In an ideal world, we would short bad businesses with bad business problems, which will eventually be priced in by the market, and own good businesses with good business problems.One of the ""good problems"" is undermonetization, which can take many forms but is essentially some variant of undercharging or not taking full advantage of an existing customer base. For example, ad-supported companies can undermonetize by showing users fewer ads than customers/viewers would tolerate. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) does not monetize WhatsApp despite its hundreds of millions of monthly users and almost $20B price tag.The beauty of undermonetization is that there is typically a relatively simple ""fix"" that only requires tweaks to existing product offerings and/or pricing. Such changes typically are not capital intensive and have less execution risk than would come with launching new products or entering new markets. When pairing the ""good problem"" of undermonetization with a good business that has operating leverage, the results can be quite compelling as the incremental revenue easily converts to incremental profit.Initially, focusing on undermonetizing companies was not intentional. However, as I have reflected on our portfolio, the theme is certainly recurring. If TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) can monetize 2% rather than 1% of their website traffic, our investment should work out quite well. If Yelp (NYSE:YELP) can better monetize the efforts of their existing sales force by offering more flexible contract terms that encourage trial and generate more advertisers with higher lifetime values, our investment should work out quite well (see below for further commentary).If Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) sellers do not revolt and accept the new 5% commission rate instead of the former 3%, our investment should work out quite well. Again, these are tweaks to existing structures. Etsy will continue with the same shopper traffic, the same pool of sellers, and the same exact cost structure - just a few lines of code should increase earnings and revenue dramatically.When undermonetization is addressed in a business with operating leverage, we should see accelerated revenue growth and expanding margins. Given that improving growth and improving margins are catnip for many investors, the third driver of returns, multiple expansion, can work for us as well. Now, not all undermonetization is good or easily fixable, but as internet companies mature, I expect undermonetizing companies will continue to be a fertile hunting ground for new investments. While not the traditional altar for a value investor to pray to, the manner in which improving monetization can flow through the income statement is compelling.Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) - I have said in the past that I look for investments where the valuation makes sense. In my opinion, Fiat Chrysler has reached that point again. The company has transformed itself from a company suffering under the burden of enormous debts that could only think about debt repayment to a very well capitalized company. Fiat Chrysler is currently generating over $100M per week in cash.At the end of this year, their net industrial cash should exceed $2.50 per share. On top of this, after the end of the quarter, the company finally announced the impending sale of their parts business, Magneti Marelli, which will add another $4+ of net cash when it closes early next year. So adjusting for the sale of the parts business, FCAU has approximately 40% of its market capitalization in cash.Today, FCAU trades (ex cash) for less than 3X forward earnings. If we assume that they can achieve their five-year plan, shares ex-cash are trading for less than 1X 2022 earnings. Typically, these valuations only show up for sick and dying businesses.In contrast, Fiat Chrysler's U.S. sales were up 15% Y/Y in September and are up 6% year-to-date. The company also has several product introductions in the pipeline to introduce new models in categories where their brands have not been represented. Of particular interest are the new three-row, seven-passenger Jeep Grand Cherokee and the Jeep Scrambler pickup truck that will be introduced next year.Yes, Fiat Chrysler is a cyclical and capital intensive business, but it has been structured to allow for variability in revenue. At the company's recent Capital Markets Day, management provided guidance that the company could remain profitable even if U.S. auto sales dropped as low as 10M cars. U.S. new car sales dipped to 9M in the depths of the 2008 financial crisis, so it is reasonable to expect the company to remain profitable in nearly all but the most draconian scenarios. The question is - how profitable? Fiat's Chairman is not a novice capital allocator. He makes the pilgrimage to Omaha. He finally has real levers to pull at FCAU.How might this play out? There are all indications that the company would like to restore their dividend. It would be interesting to see how FCAU was valued based on a dividend yield. They could easily cover a €1/$1.14 per year dividend - apply a 5% yield to that and you have a $22+ stock. It would not surprise me at all if Elkan initiates a combination of a tender offer and/or buyback to take advantage of the stock's price as I believe he is inclined in the very short term to try and walk the valuation up to be in a stronger position to effect a merger with another OEM to realize the enormous potential synergies.These options have never been available to him, now they are and I think they will be utilized in 2018, hopefully to dramatic effect. As a result, I have layered a small short-dated out-of-the-money option position and an in-the-money option position to allow the fund to profit disproportionately should this scenario occur. I do not purchase options as a regular practice and 90% of options expire worthless, so this cherry on top may disappear, but the opportunity well outweighs the cost. Given the company's current valuation, known catalysts, and orientation of the Chairman, I continue to like the set-up.Etsy - As previously discussed, Etsy has announced a significant price increase to a commission rate of 5%; when combined with the payment processing fee of 3%, the net result is a take rate of approximately 8%. Fortunately, this pales in comparison to the current Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Made rate of 15%. The value proposition to sellers of being able to reach 20M + buyers for a listing fee of 20 cents and only paying the 8% upon a sale of an item remains very compelling.SharpSpring (NASDAQ:SHSP) - SharpSpring has become a Top 5 holding through a combination of price appreciation and the purchase of additional shares over several months. SharpSpring is a SaaS (Software as a Service) business that provides marketing automation software primarily for digital marketing agencies who utilize their technology to run sophisticated digital campaigns that include web pages customized based on a visitor's historical activity.Purchasing SharpSpring's software gives a customer licenses for use with up to three clients. The software is also white-labeled so that an agency can present it with their own branding and can upsell if they choose. With this model, SharpSpring has an attractive LTV/CAC ratio typically greater than 6.In English, that means that for every $1 they spend acquiring a customer, that customer will generate $6 in lifetime value. The right way to run this business, in my opinion, is to spend every available dollar on sales and marketing to build the customer base, not worrying about short-term profitability. SharpSpring management agrees, and recently executed a convertible debt offering to access additional resources for marketing.SharpSpring operates in an oligopolistic market with three primary competitors: HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS), Act-On, and Pardot (by Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)). HubSpot is the largest competitor and in a difficult competitive position relative to SharpSpring. HubSpot has a large customer base paying in excess of $30K per year versus SharpSpring charging less than $5K per year. HubSpot cannot easily slash prices 75% to compete on price, and given the near-parity of the offerings, offering a ""stripped down"" version is also not viable. These dynamics have driven adoption and market share gains for SHSP, particularly among smaller agencies.SharpSpring has benefitted from multiple expansion, but also has executed well. Product revenue grew 40% in their last reported quarter. In a more recent press release, the company announced a record number of new customers in Q3 while maintaining marketing efficiency (their LTV/CAC should remain above 6). There is a very long runway for growth for SharpSpring.The company will benefit from secular tailwinds in an industry growing over 20% per year. There is also a history of acquisitions in the space at premiums to where shares trade today. SharpSpring came to my attention through a conversation with Jeremy Kahan of North Peak, a manager the Partners Fund is invested with.TripAdvisor - TripAdvisor remains the dominant travel research company and maintains the largest installed base for travel apps. The company continues to make progress on their in-destination business for local tours and activities, and has been optimizing ad spending on the hotel business to improve profitability. We continue to hold the shares as it is entirely plausible that TripAdvisor can improve their monetization rates on the $1.3+ trillion in travel spend it influences.The company has announced but not rolled out a new version of the site, which features a personal travel feed that makes it easier to plan and book travel while putting an emphasis on friend and influencer recommendations when available. Like any major overhaul, it has the possibility of improving the experience and economics… or not. Time will tell.Yelp - We discussed Yelp in detail in Greenhaven's Q2 letter. The initial indications are that the transition away from one-year contracts and toward more flexible, ""cancelable at any time"" commitments has gone well. As management said in their quarterly letter to shareholders (Link):There remains the possibility of increased traction of new offerings, improved monetization, operating leverage, and multiple expansion.EnviroStar (NYSEMKT:EVI) - Given SHSP's strength and EVI's price declines, EnviroStar was replaced in the Top 5 during Q3. This remains a very large holding for our partnership, and there continues to be progress. The company has announced five acquisitions so far this year as they continue to execute their buy and build strategy. EVI will not screen cheaply for several reasons, including deal costs, which depress current year earnings, and a larger infrastructure, which depresses short-term margins.As EnviroStar scales, we should see operating leverage and margin expansion as this infrastructure is spread over a larger base of business. As discussed in past letters, there is also a dynamic where acquisitions made late in the year immediately increase the fully diluted share count but only contribute a partial year of revenue and earnings.While short-term earnings may be understated, the long-term potential of EnviroStar remains compelling as they create value with the ability to acquire assets at 5X EBITDA using a stock currency that is in excess of 15X EBITDA. When paired with the ability to improve the acquired companies and a current balance sheet that can accommodate significant debt, this flywheel can turn for a long time.There are a lot of ways to invest. There is a more quantitative method driven by particular ratios such as price to book, price to earnings, and return on invested capital. The investment I am about to describe is driven far more by the qualitative. For such investments, I often gain conviction through a synthesis of my life experiences and hypotheses about the future. To provide the context for our most recent investment, let me lay out three life experiences. They are somewhat disjointed, but are important pieces to the puzzle.The first relevant experience occurred when I was in business school. After the first semester, students got to choose courses that we thought would be interesting, so I signed up for a class called ""Managing a Multinational Organization."" I had previously managed a small company, and was intrigued by the prospect of pulling back the curtain on what managing a multinational company would look like. It was one of the best classes I ever attended… but it does not appear on my transcript.I walked out of the class after 20 minutes and vowed to never try to manage a multinational company myself. The issues of a small company are dramatically magnified when dealing with different languages, cultures, customer preferences, labor laws, regulations, etc. A large enterprise is exponentially more complex than a small business and requires special skills and tools.The second relevant experience came from my time in an operating role at Acelero, the education services company I helped found. We were looking at selling a technology-based product to Head Start programs, but selling this type of product was not something we had done before, so we tried to pick the brains of the smartest entrepreneurs in the space in order to shape our sales and marketing strategy. One day we were able to meet an individual who, in our opinion, had ""cracked the code"" in the education space, having grown from two guys in rented office space to eventually being acquired by a public company.When discussing how to sell in the education space, he said that their sales strategy hinged on identifying what motivated the customer, and addressing those motivations. This is pretty basic and common sense, but, he then went on to say something that proved to be incredibly insightful. To paraphrase:In regulated industries, compliance can drive hundreds of billions of dollars of purchases just because the product checks a box for regulators and allows everyone to keep their jobs.The third life experience also occurred at Acelero. When we first started, we had a paper checkbook in the filing cabinet. We ran payroll monthly using a bookkeeper. It was as low tech as you could get. As we added a few employees, we graduated to Paychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) where we could phone in our payroll.For a period of growth from 10 to 100 employees, we used a boutique PEO (professional employer organization), and when we crossed 100 employees, we switched over to ADP (NASDAQ:ADP), which was the provider of choice for larger companies. Over time, we did far more than issue paychecks with ADP as their data and systems integrated with our health insurance provider, our retirement plans, and our corporate learning tools.Unfortunately, we grew to hate ADP. We hated the (lack of) service, we hated the pricing, and we hated the user interfaces. However, we stayed with them year after year after year because they were integral to running our finance department, and the complexity and risks of changing payroll providers and interrupting all of those integrations were too high. Removing ADP as the center of this ecosystem felt like the equivalent of attempting a brain transplant - the integrations kept us captive as they created a very significant barrier to exit. We stayed not because we were happy, but it was too hard to leave.So to summarize, my past experiences gave me an admiration for the complexity facing large enterprises, a recognition that - particularly in a regulated industry - purchase decisions are often driven by compliance, and an appreciation for how integrations between vendors for critical systems can effectively lock in a customer. Recently, these experiences, coupled with two other themes that have been running through my research process, laid the foundation for a new investment.The first theme, discussed above, is companies that are ""undermonetizing"" can be attractive investments. The second theme percolating is also an obvious one: data is today's gold, and it is unlikely that companies will, on average, spend less on accessing, sharing, and protecting it. There is real career risk in skimping on data, and data management and cybersecurity have significant tailwinds for the next decade or longer.None of these experiences or themes are blindingly brilliant, but collectively they are the underpinnings for our investment in Box, Inc.Box started 13 years ago out of a USC dorm room as an online file storage company, effectively offering a cloud-based hard drive to store computer files. Today, there are multiple companies that will allow a user to store a virtually unlimited number of files for a nominal amount of money, or even for free. Online file storage is a ""bad"" business as there is little value add and it is effectively a commodity. The founders of Box realized that commodity storage could be a race to the bottom, so relatively early on, they began to focus on the enterprise customers (larger companies), and particularly companies in regulated industries.For large companies in regulated industries such as healthcare or defense, storing information is easy: compliance is the tricky part. Large companies need to control who can access files, and with whom the files can be shared both externally and internally. There needs to be a log of all activity surrounding the file. Who opened it, when and where did they log in from, etc.? There are file retention policies to be enforced. While Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Drive may work for a small business, the compliance needs of an enterprise quickly strain the functionality of Google.Do you want your health records stored on a free Dropbox account your doctor got by sharing the email address of 5 friends? If you run a defense contractor with 150,000 employees, do you want them using a hodge-podge of Dropbox (NASDAQ:DBX), Google Drive, and OneDrive? Large companies need more robust data storage solutions. They need the ability to share content internally and externally but also to have controls and records of how that sharing occurred. They need the ability to lock files. To gain a sense of the robustness of the Box offering, it is worth perusing this feature comparison datasheet (linked here).Over the last decade, Box has built a customer base of over 87,000 companies with over 10M users that store their data on Box servers, including 69% of the Fortune 500. Box has integrated with 1,400+ applications so far, including Google Suite, DocuSign (NASDAQ:DOCU), and Slack. The products and integrations allow files stored with Box to be ""the source of truth,"" which means that while other applications can access files stored on Box, all of the changes are made and kept on the Box version where the security and sharing protocols can be applied. These integrations make it less likely a customer will leave Box, and diminish the chances that a direct or adjacent competitor could create a copycat product.The robustness of Box's current product suite and the lack of credible alternatives has led to very low churn rates: retention is 95%. Because of the addition of new products and the sales of additional seats, we can expect the core base of customers (before any new customer adds) to spend more this year than they did last year. In fact, Box's net dollar retention is running at approximately 108%, so even if no new customers were added, and with some attrition, we would still expect revenue to increase at least 8% before factoring in sales to new customers.Box has a very sticky product, and a large customer base. There is the potential to further monetize the customer base by selling a lot more product and services to the existing base to take advantage of being the holders of critical data. Box is sprinting at this opportunity. The company is spending over $100M a year on R&D. While meeting the compliance use cases of large enterprises is complex, it does not require this level of R&D spending.Box is aggressively building a robust pipeline of new products for release over the next two years, designed to improve how people work with and share information, the security of information, as well as applying automation and machine learning. Here are a couple of links to provide a sense of the future products and how they take advantage of Box's unique position and how far Box will be from a simple file storage company.Box Shield (video linked here) Box Skills (overview video linked here).Box recently added a new board member, Kimberly Hammonds, and in the press release she said,I feel the same way.I have not seen Box written up in any of the traditional venues like SumZero but it was presented by venture capitalist CEO Chamath Palihapitiya at the Ira Sohn conference. He argues that Box is a way for individuals and companies to benefit from the improvements in AI (Artificial Intelligence). Over time, Box customers (who are generally larger and have more types of data spread across more users than customers of other solutions) inevitably will want to apply artificial intelligence to their data.In fact, they will likely want to apply AI solutions from multiple vendors. Box is application agnostic and will be able to integrate with all of the major AI players including Google, IBM (NYSE:IBM), and Amazon. Thus, by storing files on Box, companies will have both the security they need and also the flexibility to work with multiple vendors to access and mine their files in different ways. Typically, when I hear a buzz word like AI, a combination of words like vaporware, hype, and short come to mind.In the case of Box, at this point only the expense of creating this functionality has been realized as these integrations have been built and are being tested but have yet to launch. The ability to apply the best AI offerings to data stored on box represents a free call option that could be another barrier to exit that generates revenue and is buzzworthy enough to generate multiple expansion.Box is missing one characteristic that I value: high insider ownership. Box was started by four college-aged friends with limited personal resources. Their first round of funding came from Mark Cuban. Eventually, as the company pursued developing for and selling into the enterprise market, they raised hundreds of millions of dollars in several rounds of financing. As a net result, the co-founder CEO owns approximately $70M in stock and the co-founder CFO just north of $20M. So while collectively they hold less than 5% of the company, they do have ""skin in the game"" and are not simply hired hands.Box operates in a massive market that they refer to as ""Cloud Content Management"" and size at $45B per year. I think no matter how we define it, it is likely growing and worth multiples of Box's current revenue. Last year, Box generated operating cash flow while spending roughly two-thirds of revenue on sales and marketing and product development (54% and 20%, respectively). Over time, a company's value should approximate the rates of return that they can get when they reinvest capital.As discussed before, with a customer base of 87,000 companies, it is easy to see a very high ROI on new product development. I am typically skeptical of sales and marketing spend as it can be a sugar high to drive short-term growth. However, with customer retention rates running in the above 90% and net dollar retention running well above $100, Box is actually probably not spending enough on sales and marketing. There is a slide on page 88 of their investor day deck (link) that shows revenue growth by cohort.It is beautiful. Several different years of customer cohorts have been compounding revenue growth well in excess of 20% per year. Now, marketing effectiveness may deteriorate over time, but the last two years have seen CAGR's of 24% and 20%, and there is still a largely untapped international opportunity as the U.S. constitutes 76% of revenue.All of the above paints the picture of a high-quality business with a bright future. Companies like this are rarely optically cheap. We are currently buying shares at just north of 4X next year's sales, which one could argue is cheap relative to many SaaS peers, (Dropbox and DocuSign have valuations twice as rich) but certainly is not on an absolute basis. I think one of the greatest risk factors here is multiple compression, particularly if growth slows.However, given the product pipeline and sales pipeline, I don't think the slowdown is imminent. In the long run, Box has the opportunity to continuously improve their business through a virtuous cycle of retaining customers and improving monetization. Product improvements lead to greater value add, which leads to greater utilization, greater lock in, lower churn, and higher revenue per user. Revenue growth and margin expansion are highly probable, with multiple expansion a possibility. No additional capital is required to grow.There is a long runway for growth, and multiple opportunities for additional products to be sold into a large and attractive customer base. Continued revenue growth of 20%+ for the foreseeable future, coupled with operating leverage and a very valuable customer base, create an interesting set-up.We ended the quarter with limited short exposure. The fund remains short ETFs targeted at short-term traders, a bond fund where the underlying interest rates received relative to the risk assumed do not pass my common-sense test, and two indices as very modest hedges.In September, we held Greenhaven's annual meeting in New York City. It is a special night for me, as I get the in-person opportunity to share context on the health and direction of the partnership, enjoy the company of our limited partners, and to say thank you. At the meeting, I spoke about three operating principles that have guided the firm over time. The first was to go slow and recognize that doing nothing is usually the right course of action. The second principle is to only pursue the ""Hell Yeahs.""If something does not really excite me, we will leave it to others. The final operating principle is that design matters. How we organize, who we invest with, and how we spend our time are the most critical decisions. The primary filter for all design choices is, ""can it help improve returns?"" This may sound simple, but it is very different than how most large hedge funds operate.Also at the meeting, we gave a small set of gifts to the limited partners in attendance that included the book Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don't Have All the Facts by Annie Duke. Annie Duke has an interesting background, awarded a National Science Foundation Fellowship to study Cognitive Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.She was also one of the top poker players in the world for two decades, winning over $4M in poker tournaments and a lot more elsewhere. She was also part of a group of players who helped each other improve their decision making. The group was led by a player named Eric Seidel, who has over $38M in tournament winnings.I think this book is well worth reading as it is a nice summary of probabilistic thinking and how to apply it. At the core, many of our investments are, in my estimation, asymmetric. There is a chance we may lose money, but there is a significant chance at a large profit, providing a positive expected value.When I say design matters, and who I spend our time with is important, I mean it. Under the umbrella of the Partners Fund, I am going to convene Annie Duke and the portfolio managers of the funds the Partners Funds is invested in. As I wrote in the invitation to the managers,The day with Annie Duke will be followed by a day of idea sharing among the managers. I don't know exactly what will come of these gatherings, but in my experience, good content and good people are a promising formula. While I believe our best chance at generating returns are with an investment committee of one, I am also keenly aware that the best chance of success will not be acting entirely alone. Rather, our best chances for success will be from the combination of the right limited partners, the right managers in the Partners Fund, and the right outside resources. The Annie Duke day will be another stop on that journey.We have a healthy economy and a portfolio of companies that have the opportunity for revenue growth, margin expansion, and multiple expansion over time. As volatility arises, I will attempt to take advantage of the opportunities it creates. We will continue to invest with a long-time horizon, and we will continue to invest like it is our own money - because it is. Thank you for the opportunity to grow your family capital alongside mine.Sincerely,Scott MillerEditor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks.

4225947,103012,2018-12-03T11:18:25-05:00,"Yelp's high growth days are over; FY2019 is expected to be growing at just above 10 per cent.Management cited four internal issues which may prove to be temporary.Management has also proposed a plausible go-to-market strategy; if it works, Yelp will be able to grow its bottom-line much higher than the guided 2-3 per cent.However, insiders have been selling aggressively, and employee share options are too generous.Yelp is not cheap, but its balance sheet is incredibly strong, the operational issue is fixable. Thus, the downside is limited.","In 2004, Yelp (YELP) started an online database of user-generated reviews of local businesses. Eight years later, it filed for IPO, and it timed incredibly well, right in the middle of a hockey stick growth of smartphones adoption. Credit to building a strong sale force (currently three thousand plus), YELP was able to grow its advertising revenue at 50%+ for many years.The recent Q3-18 results demonstrated several serious setbacks and caused the share price to drop drastically. It now expects to grow its top line at just above 10% in 2019. Fortunately, the period of high growth between 2012 and 2017 meant that YELP had accumulated $850M in cash. Additionally, YELP also has built a solid brand within its niche. While we find it hard to imagine YELP trumping Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB) or growing its top line like before, we believe that it can make a transition to a stable and matured enterprise.Yelp’s average share price has been around $40-$50 since IPO. It has never surpassed the $100 nor declined below the $15 mark. While the market has priced YELP for perfection at $100, currently at $30, YELP has a chance to prove its worth. We don’t think YELP is a bargain, but we also do not think YELP has much more to fall.YELP reported net revenue of $241M and free cash flow (NYSE:FCF) of $46M. From an outside view, a company with a market cap of about $2.8B, $850M in the bank, and generates $46M of FCF per quarter. That is a pretty decent business. However, the revenue growth of ""just"" 8% upset investors as their expectations was probably much higher.Zooming out a few years, the rate of growth decelerated drastically, and whatever the market was expecting, it was unreasonable.Source: YELP Company Financials, Author’s workingsAt the Q3 earnings call, the management pinpointed four problems that caused the drastic slowdown. They were internal, operational and temporary problems. We will go through one by one.The four problems above had a negative consequence on the customer conversion and retention side. Additionally, the shift to non-term advertising has introduced new customer behaviors, including a greater number of trial purchases and on-and-off spending patterns.This time it could be a short-term issue? The number indicates that the churn rate was high in Q3. However, going forward it will be lower as the customers learn more about the non-term contract.Despite the issue discussed, Yelp has a few positives going forward. We like that Yelp is diversifying its go-to-market strategy. Instead of relying on the sales force of 3000+ staff, they are experimenting with growth in self-serve, national and third-party sales channels.We are particularly interested in the ""self-serve."" The self-service channel is similar to business owners setting up their business page on FB or registering an address on Google map themselves. When these business pages are dynamic, engaging, and allow greater control, the adoption of self-service will improve. To Yelp, this is the cheapest way to grow.In the last 12 months, there were 200 thousand YELP business pages claimed either by self-service or through the sales force. The management expects it to be a more significant driver of their growth and to the overall acquisition of the company. Indeed, the focus on self-serve will not be cheap to start with, but as it gains momentum, it will allow us YELP to think about the level of investment and the rate of growth that they want to have on the sales force side.Third-party partners sales channels also a cost-effective way. It also allows marketing agencies to better control their client’s marketing spending and measure return on investments.As a result of these two initiatives, the management expectsHowever, the FY2018 guidance in Q3 was reduced from Q2.The issues discussed are reflected in the new guidance. The good news is that these appear to be temporary and are within the company’s control.What we do not like in Yelp is the speed of shareholder dilution. Although most of the increase in the share number was from employee options, the amount increased by almost 50% since 2012.Source: YELP financials, Author’s workingThe good news is Yelp has authorized a buyback programme with an initial amount of $200M, $3M was used in Q3. The average buyback price is $40. The remaining amount is $115M.Source: YELP financials, Author’s workingAnother negative is insiders are selling aggressively since October. It shows a conflicting signal with the buyback.Source: Insidercow, YELPYelp has a huge pile of cash at almost $850M and a tiny amount of debt, at $34M. Compared to a market cap of $2.8B, cash is one-third of the value. So does the remaining part of the business worth $1.95B?Assuming Yelp achieve the mid-point adjusted EBITDA at $179 for 2018. It is trading at just above 10x EBITDA. The multiple is not expensive considering a company that is also growing the top line at 10% and bottom-line at 2-3%.Regarding free cash flow, YELP seems reasonably priced.Source: Yelp financials, Author’s workingTTM FCF is $111M. Thus it indicates a 17x FCF multiple of Yelp net cash.However, since employees are paid handsomely in options, the amount should be adjusted from the free cash flow amount.Source: YELP financials, Author’s workingAdjusted TTM FCF is now just under $1M, implying a much different picture.As a valuation metric, we usually prefer to look at FCF. In this sense, Yelp is not cheap at all.Yelp will need to make up the slower growth with stronger bottom-line expansion. The tactics that management have proposed are still in its infancy. However, we think they are plausible, and the company will be able to see which go-to-market strategy is going to make the most sense, and how do they drive the highest margin.Given time, YELP will evolve to be more asset-light, and in the long run, it can expand its EBITDA faster than the guided 2-3%. For now, the growth days are over, and investors have to contend with the act that it is making a transition to a more matured business. We encourage investors to keep a tap on Yelp but also watch out future employee share options pay-out.

In a nutshell, investors for several years now have been buying growth stocks, but never bothered to look at the valuation they were paying for them. As long as a company's revenue was growing, investors paid pie-in-the sky valuations.I was never able to caution investors on why they should not buy Yelp or similarly-valued stocks. No matter what I said, they would tell me they are paying for growth, and the valuation is justified. Financial ratios never mattered to anyone, nor did profitability, or that pesky P/E.Yelp's adjusted EPS was $0.17 per share, that beat by $0.07. On the other hand revenue missed by $4.3M, but it was still up 8% Y/Y. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $50.3M, a very small miss from the $51.4M estimate. Finally full-year revenue is estimated by the company between the range of $938M-$942M vs the consensus of $963M. My question is, are these figures enough to bring any stock down by 30%? In my book they are not and something else must be the culprit. And that something else is that investors have been paying pie-in-the-sky multiples for a very long time, and suddenly came to their senses. YELP data by YChartsYelp's stock has been falling for several years despite its rapid growth. And the reason for this slide has nothing to do with the company. In fact the company's revenue has been growing by leaps and bounds. So why has Yelp's stock been falling for the past 4 years? Because for some reason I never understood, investors back in 2014 bid up its shares all the way to almost $100, that never made any investment sense, and its shares have been on a downhill road ever since. YELP Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsWhile the company's revenue grew at very high rates, investors failed to realize they were pre-paying for this growth by buying a very inflated stock price.YELP PS Ratio (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsPlease note the above chart. I have cautioned investors many times in the past to be wary of stocks that trade above 5X revenue. Unless you are sure that profitably and high growth will persist over many years, such stocks should be avoided. Yes, I know you will show me several examples of stocks that have defied this rule, but they are the expiation not the rule. The way I approach this question in the case of Yelp, is to try to figure out what the company's revenue will be on a forward basis, and then take into account several other factors.So let's start with revenue. We don't have any guidance from the company yet, so let's see what analysts have to say. Analysts are modeling $1.05B in revenue for 2019. If we assume the company does about $940M in revenue for 2018 (as per guidance), then revenue growth for 2019 will be about 8.8%. In my book, no company with 8% growth is worth 3X revenue, unless profitability warrants it, which it does not in this case. However please note that this figure might come down over the next several weeks. Analysts have not yet adjusted their estimates based on what the company had to say in the conference call:I believe the key words that spooked everyone were ""lower-than-expected net account additions"". What this probably means is that new advertisers coming to the platform are less than in the past. Might this mean that those willing to pay for advertising on Yelp's platform are an ever smaller pool? Or does it mean the company is facing more competition from the likes of Facebook (FB), Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL), or even smaller platforms like Groupon (GRPN)? This is unknown at the current time. However the company also said that monthly average mobile unique devices grew by 4 million Y/Y. So in my mind the problem is not with user engagement. People are engaging with Yelp's app more than ever, the problem is probably with advertisers.As long as user engagement grows, I think eventually advertisers will follow and revenue should grow. So it might just be that the company is correct when it said it is experiencing ""operational issues in our local Advertising business"" and as soon as these issues are resolved, revenue growth and profitability will return.However, the question remains, is Yelp worth its current price, even assuming all issues are fixed and growth returns according to expectations?My answer is no. Over the past 4 quarters Yelp's total adjusted EPS has been $0.45. If you do the math, the trailing P/E is 71 with 10% revenue growth. In my book no stock justifies such a P/E when it is growing only by 10%.The funny thing is that with the exception of 2 quarters, Yelp has been beating expectations since 2014. So why have shares retreated so mush when every quarter the company has beaten the consensus? Because the so called ""bad quarter"" was not the real reason for the stock's 30% decline. Yelp is simply a very expensive stock, it's as simple as that. The current market volatility and the risk-off environment just made that more evident. In my opinion no matter what Yelp's results might have been, the stock was still going to correct. Simply put, Yelp was always a very rich stock, and it seems even more rich today in the current risk-off environment. I am not sure what levels might be a good opportunity to buy the stock, however I think it's much lower than where it is today. And because Yelp is not an easy stock to value, I would wait for the market to tell us. As such, if you were interested in the stock (as I am), I would wait until I get a bullish buy signal on the charts. Use any technical indicator you like on a weekly scale, and when you get a buy signal, then consider entering the stock once more."

At the time of the initial report, the stock received an Unattractive rating.

On January 16, SQN followed up with an investor presentation calling for the board to ""immediately evaluate strategic alternatives including a possible sale of Yelp.""In our original article, we deemed a potential acquisition of Yelp unlikely due to its declining profitability and significant hidden liabilities. However, we have enough experience with Stupid Money Risk to know that companies overpay for acquisitions all the time.In addition, YELP's fundamentals have improved enough over the past two and a half years that it may be slightly more palatable for a potential acquirer.

The trend began in late October, when the mammoth of the industry, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), reported a Q3 earnings beat amid a revenue miss attributed to a slowdown in advertising income. Facebook (FB) reported a similar quarter a week later. Then, real estate platform Zillow (Z) acknowledged that a change in the way it sourced leads for real estate agents caused them to pull back on advertising. And now, Yelp (YELP) has also noted a slowdown in the advertising fees accrued from its small business accounts.Perhaps businesses large and small across the U.S. are shielding themselves from a recession, cutting down on marketing expenses and hoarding cash in the anticipation of an economic slowdown. The problem isn't Yelp's alone. But it is among the hardest-hit, alongside Zillow. While the large-cap internet advertising stocks have largely held steady, Yelp crashed nearly 30% after reporting its results, mirroring similar declines after Zillow's Q3 report earlier in the week:YELP data by YChartsIt certainly also didn't help that J.P. Morgan (JPM), one of the company's most outspoken Wall Street bulls who had earlier marked it as a Top Pick, downgraded Yelp, citing competition from Facebook and Google.Here's what keeps me hopeful on Yelp, though - Yelp's problems aren't just isolated within Yelp alone. All of the major internet giants have reported weaker advertising revenues this quarter. If Yelp's competitors are also suffering a slowdown, it's not Yelp's business model that is going down the drain.Looking longer-term, internet advertising as a whole will be fine. Digital advertising is now nearly a $100 billion market that is growing exponentially, according to AdNews. Recode also noted that 2017 was the first year that digital advertising surpassed TV advertising spend. There is no reason to believe that over the next 5-10 years, the strength of digital advertising will fade. Within this giant market, there is room for many players - including Yelp.Yelp certainly isn't perfect. Apart from the industry-wide shortage of ad growth, the company addressed some operational issues that led to some of the revenue shortfall. In my view, however, Yelp's cheap valuation (multiples of <2x revenues and <10.5x EBITDA, as shown in the chart above, are nearly unheard of in the internet sector) excuses some of these execution flaws.Buying a struggling business in the hope of a rebound is far less fun than buying a hot, expensive IPO on a growth streak, but with Yelp now trading at 40% below its 52-week highs, the cheap valuation is worth the risk.While I believe much of Yelp's revenue slowdown is an industry-wide phenomenon, the company also acknowledged that it faced many operational issues in the quarter that led to top-line disappointment.Lanny Baker, Yelp's CFO, commented as follows on the Q3 earnings call:Recall that Yelp made a big pivot into ""non-term"" advertising last quarter, which essentially means advertising contracts that don't have a fixed length. Last quarter this new ad offering proved popular with customers, leading to a surge of revenues (Q2 revenues grew 12% y/y versus Wall Street expectations of 10% y/y).Non-term has its downsides, however - the lack of a contract length offers advertisers the flexibility to churn their accounts, which is what happened this quarter. The company noted that it saw a new ""on-and-off"" spending pattern within its advertising base. While this might mean that Yelp's revenue streams might be more lumpy from now on, it doesn't mean that advertisers will lower their spend on the platform overall. Recall that a large portion of Yelp's advertising base are in small- and mid-sized businesses, which have far greater spend variance than enterprises. Perhaps this quarter saw more of that variance as industry-wide advertising spend pulled back on fears of an economic slowdown.It's important to note as well that Yelp is still calling for double-digit revenue growth in FY19, signaling that it expects these problems to normalize.Here's a look at Yelp's results in the third quarter:Figure 1. Yelp 3Q18 resultsSource: Yelp investor relationsRevenues grew 8% y/y to $241.1 million, decelerating four points from last quarter's 12% y/y growth rate and missing Wall Street's consensus of $245.4 million (+10% y/y) by two points. We note, however, that Yelp's optically low revenue growth partially stems from the fact that it sold its food and dining subsidiary eat24 to GrubHub (GRUB). If we exclude eat24's $17.6 million of revenues from the prior-year compare, Yelp's revenues actually grew 17% y/y on an organic basis, though this is still down five points from last quarter's organic growth rate of 22% y/y.Figure 2. Yelp prior-year compare excluding eat24Source: Yelp investor relationsWhile revenue shortfalls are undoubtedly disappointing, we have to take into account as well that management attributes part of this shortfall to a slowdown in sales hiring. The choice between revenue growth and profitability often hinges on sales spending as a lever, and this quarter, Yelp's profit benefited while revenue suffered. As a percentage of revenues, sales and marketing expenses were only 50.5% - 10bps lower than 50.6% in the year-ago quarter.Overall, operating income grew 51% y/y to $10.4 million. Adjusted EBITDA, Yelp's preferred profit metric, also sustained an impressive 17% y/y growth rate and saw two points of additional adjusted EBITDA margin, up to 21% versus 19% in the year-ago quarter:Figure 3. Yelp adj. EBITDASource: Yelp investor relationsIt's also reassuring to note that Yelp's EPS of $0.17 showed massive upside to Wall Street's expectations of $0.10. Had Yelp pumped more investment into sales and marketing, it might have matched revenue expectations but missed on EPS. Obviously, we'd like for the company to hit both targets, but overall the quarter doesn't look bad enough to merit a 30% stock correction.While Facebook and Google dominate the world of internet advertising, and many smaller players like Zillow dominate certain verticals like real estate, Yelp still remains one of the core platforms for small business advertising across many verticals. Yelp's primary value proposition as a trusted source of reviews for local business remains steady, so its unique appeal to advertisers is still intact - I'd be more worried about a slowdown in traffic or reputation than a temporary hit to advertising revenues, especially when all the digital advertising giants are posting similar revenue misses.While there's certainly risk involved in buying a stock that has acknowledged sales execution issues, Yelp is cheap enough at ~2x forward revenues where there is far more upside risk than downside risk. Yelp's market cap has shrunk to just $2.67 billion, while the company has $838 million of cash and no debt, making a bite-sized enterprise value of $1.83 billion for a company that generates nearly $1 billion in annual revenues and nearly $50 million in EBITDA per quarter. At Yelp's current prices, I'm definitely a bull."

The consumer review site always follows strong quarters with unexpected issues. The stock has historically been a buy on these dips as the key consumer metrics constantly expand in the 20% range.Image Source: Yelp websiteAnybody following the company knows that Yelp has a history of salesforce execution-related failures. The key metrics of consumer reviews, paying advertiser accounts and app unique devices consistently grows in the 20% range. The fact that sales have periods of weakness followed by a burst back to normal growth levels is a sign of operational issues, not competitive threats from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (GOOG) or Facebook (FB).During Q3, all of the above-mentioned key metrics grew by about 20%. The major hiccup is that paying advertiser accounts were flat with Q2 as a bunch of new accounts cancelled.Source: Yelp Q3'18 shareholder letterThe company suggested a whole litany of issues causing the revenue miss and weak guidance. The question for investors is whether one trusts that these issues broken out in the shareholder letter are solvable. The market is suggesting the answer is no with the 30% decline in the stock.A lot of these issues question why Yelp allows simple problems to impact results to the point they aren't addressed soon enough to prevent a large impact to numbers. One only has to look at this 3-year chart to see a history of problems.YELP data by YChartsBack in early 2016, the stock plunged as slow user growth was questioned. The company was able to eventually move the business toward the mobile app where the consumer review site was no longer reliant on search traffic from Google.Back in early 2017, Yelp slipped again as revenue guidance missed estimates. This time the market panicked due to another issue with sales performance.Back in mid-2018, the stock again slipped due to some market confusion surrounding financial metrics after the sale of Eat24 to GrubHub (GRUB).Clearly, the company has an execution issue in relation to what the market expects. The key to the above problems is that the stock eventually headed higher after each failed quarter result with a trend of higher highs.The key is that the operational metrics remained strong while the company is a cash flow machine. Yelp might've missed Q3 revenue metrics, but the company beat EPS estimates and grew EBITDA to $50 million. The company has generated $119 million in cash flows from operations YTD and ended the period with $837 million in the bank.These metrics suggest a very healthy company. Looking at the long-term revenue trends confirms how the market overreacts to short-term issues in the sales funnel. Over the last 5 years, Yelp has consistently grown revenues while the stock has fluctuated wildly. Even the stock gains off the 2016 lows have been completely due to the revenue growth with the EV/S multiple still trading at trough levels of about 3x.YELP data by YChartsThe recent weakness is even more evident as the key EV/S '19 multiple is at only 1.7x. This assumes '19 revenues reach $1.1 billion, down from current estimates around $1.13 billion.The key investor takeaway is that Yelp typically runs into these quarterly issues. As long as investors focus on key user metrics, the stock ultimately rebounds as the company is able to refocus the business and return in the next few quarters with solid results. The stock weakness is likely to persist for a while, but Yelp is an obvious bargain below $30.Disclaimer: The information contained herein is for informational purposes only.

The large cap S&P 500 index was up +7.7%, while the small cap Russell 2000 was up +3.6%, respectively. Together these results put our Small / Large Blended Benchmark up +4.6% for the quarter. Choice Equities Fund (CEF) largely treaded water for the quarter, down -.6% and -.7% on a gross and net basis. Despite the flat performance in the quarter, we continue to be pleased with the year thus far, up +35.9% gross and +28.5% net, as well as our +37.3% and +29.1% gross and net annualized rates of return since becoming independent at the start of 2017.In this letter, we will discuss drivers of performance for the quarter with a principal focus on Lawson Products (NASDAQ:LAWS) as we discuss the market's delayed recognition of an accretive deal it closed last year. We will provide a brief description of platform companies and their often-advantaged business models, given two of our three new holdings fit this description. We will then introduce our new positions in Destination Maternity (NASDAQ:DEST) and Yelp (NYSE:YELP). And as is usual in our quarterly letters, we will close with a brief assessment of the current environment, particularly in regard to the recent return to choppy market conditions.In our last quarterly letter, we likened our investing efforts to fishing. We reminded investors that sometimes we would catch loads of fish and sometimes it would look like we could not a catch a thing. We stated that in pursuit of our concentrated style of investing, we would occasionally appear out of sync with the markets or lag our comparisons, but over time, our approach would be well worth it. Our performance this quarter serves as a good reminder of that fact. These occasional inconsistencies in comparisons against our market benchmarks are simply a necessary condition. After all, if we want to be quarter or two as an increasingly myopic marketplace seems to want to do. With this approach, sometimes we may be rewarded quickly, while sometimes it may take a while for the market to come around to our view. But, if we are right in our assessments, we will be rewarded in due time.Moving on to performance in the quarter, long-time portfolio holding Lawson Products (LAWS) was the biggest positive contributor, adding +3% to fund performance, ostensibly on enthusiasm about an accretive deal we wrote about last year in our 3Q 2017 letter. Drive Shack (NYSE:DS) was the biggest detractor, giving back some of its gains from the prior quarter and hurting fund performance by about -2%. Taking a closer look at LAWS, as stated above, if we are right in our assessments of value, the market will reward us in due time. But due time can sometimes take a long time, especially in the context of today's on-demand and instant gratification culture. Add in the fact that our primary focus is on the less-efficient small cap space, and these impacts can be even more pronounced. Consider that this time last year, we highlighted the company, as they had just announced and closed a highly accretive deal that October. The company was performing well, shares traded at a meaningful discount to peers and end markets looked supportive for further gains. We noted our enthusiasm. And then, nothing happened for a whole year.Shortly after announcing the deal, the company held a special call to discuss the acquisition's merits. Anybody who tuned in or read the transcript could see LAWS bought a business that furthered their strategic goals that would soon add 25%-35% to earnings. The company maintained a clean balance sheet post deal, and they continued their expansion into Canada, an expanding market for the company. Even so, shares barely budged. They reported earnings later that October, again highlighting the deal and strong operational results. Nothing. The same happened again in February. Again nothing. In April, they reported good results again, this time with the deal ""in the numbers,"" though the numbers in this report had a few moving pieces given their adoption of new FASB guidelines that used a slightly different presentation of revenue. Still nothing happened. Then finally, this July, after having had the acquisition integrated into the financials for over three quarters, the company printed results that cleanly impacted the income statement and voila - shares spiked up some ~40% over the subsequent three weeks.We highlight this development because of its impact on our performance but also to point out both the opportunities and vagaries inherent in investing in the small and micro cap space. Though this company resides on the smallish side with a nearly $300M market cap, it is not completely obscure, as it does have two analysts covering it. Considering the above, from our perspective, it is as true today as it was some 70 years ago when Ben Graham remarked that ""in the short run, markets are a voting machine; in the long run, they are a weighing machine."" For those interested in a closer look at the company, we wrote the company up in December on SumZero, and that presentation has since been posted to the website.First, let's discuss the sales. Early in the quarter, we completed the sales of our positions in building products companies GMS and BMCH, which we began exiting earlier this spring. With rates likely heading higher and investors to soon follow the playbook to sell all building products companies, both were sold to lessen our exposure in this area and make room for what we believe are higher-returning investments. Though we have lightened up in this area, we still own two building products companies in BlueLinx (NYSE:BXC) and Beacon Roofing (NASDAQ:BECN). We are holding on to them despite the market's temporary concerns because we believe they represent highly compelling values. Additionally, we exited our position in Nexeo warrants with a price gain of ~50% after the company was acquired by a larger peer. Given its small position size, it only contributed +.4% to fund performance. Lastly, we covered our profitable short in an unprofitable and overvalued online retailer whose shares had surged some 5x after it became associated with Bitcoin this past winter.Now let's turn to the additions in the quarter. We added an overlooked retailer that the market had left for dead - which we do not think is dead - and two companies that broadly fit the description of platform companies. We will discuss our investment in retailer Destination Maternity further below, but first, what is a platform company?A platform company, according to Alex Moazed and Nicholas Johnson of ""Modern Monopolies: What It Takes to Dominate the 21st Century Economy,"" who quite literally wrote the book on the subject, are companies that pursue ""a business model that facilitates the exchange of value between multiple user groups, consumers and producers."" There are many kinds. They can be marketplaces for goods or services. Or they can accommodate payments or investments, social networking, communication, gaming, content or even software development. In practice, they build networks that bring together buyers and sellers so these parties can do business and meet each other's needs more efficiently. They often act as a go-between or a middleman and take a small cut off each transaction the platform facilitates. They are two-sided toll takers or a new-era distributor of sorts. The larger the network grows, so do its profits and attraction to buyers and sellers who can increasingly locate one another there.Page by page, the authors lay out the playbook for building a profitable platform. Step one of course, is build the platform. This is easier said than done, as the architects must figure out a way to initially attract users, often starting from scratch. Though not easy, the task tends to gather momentum as the platform scales. Step two is to then monetize the platform, often through advertising or by charging small transaction fees, hopefully in a way that does not alienate the user base. The authors then discuss the unending process of protecting the platform, constantly curating it and monitoring user engagement to safeguard its blossoming profitable network effects. (Think of those Bird scooters that are everywhere all of a sudden. There is a reason they got air-dropped on your town overnight. The first-mover advantage in these networks can be real and lasting.)Moazed and Johnson then move on to discuss the financial merits of these businesses. As connectors, rather than the typical manufacturer of yesteryear, they are capital-light and benefit from low marginal costs and low ongoing maintenance capex needs. Their minimal capital requirements allow them to reinvest in other high-returning projects spurring faster and more productive growth. Warren Buffett seems to share this view, noting after the 2017 Berkshire meeting that the then top five largest companies in the US (Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)), ""required virtually no capital to run... and that was not the case in the past."" The authors of Modern Monopolies... put an even bigger exclamation point on the subject and assert that the 7% of S&P 500 net income that platform companies together comprised in 2015 will grow to 50% by 2040. It is not immediately clear if this assertion is a touch optimistic or perhaps hyperbole, but the point is the same. Many of these platforms are fantastic companies with advantaged business models. And they are growing quickly.YELP - Yelp fits the bill as a platform company. It is a two-sided marketplace which brings together consumers as both review providers and review users into a digital community that shares information primarily about local businesses. Founded by current CEO Jeremy Stoppeleman 14 years ago, its origins trace to a vision to become an online competitor to the Yellow Pages where users could enjoy the added benefit of being able to share recommendations with one another. The reviews are particularly valuable to local, small and medium businesses (SMBs), like restaurants, salons, landscapers and various service businesses, as they provide a scalable and cost-effective platform to cultivate a reputation-based marketing message. Starting essentially from scratch, Yelp has grown to become a top 25 website by traffic with ~70M users on the website and 30M unique app downloads. All in, the platform has a market leading total review base of ~150M views with 200,000 SMBs who pay for advertising services which together generate ~$1B in sales.Despite the impressive growth to date or the vast and still growing nature of the local advertising end market (which is estimated at nearly $150B annually), Yelp's market cap pales in comparison to those with similar traffic counts. We believe this presents a compelling opportunity, particularly considering the company appears to be at an inflection point. With step one of building the platform now complete, the company is moving on to step two as it seeks to better monetize the traffic on its platform. For years, the company offered advertising placement on its site to SMBs through an annual fee of $4,000. This made sense considering the Yellow Pages offered a similar pricing schedule. But now, with the Yellow Pages little more than a memory and the Yelp platform established, the company has begun experimenting with no term contracts, or something akin to a pay-to-play advertising contract with a term structure that only lasts one month. The smaller commitment of this new contract structure makes it easier for SMBs to join the platform, making it more efficient and transactional, which further reinforces the positive network effects.Engagement with the platform is healthy, as users and revenues have been growing at ~20% per year. Results with the no term contracts look to be off to a good start too, as the number of paying advertiser accounts shows some signs of accelerating, most recently up 31% in 2Q 2018. Yelp is also adding other service offerings as it attempts to better monetize the platform through the cross-selling of services. One intriguing offering is called Request-A-Quote, where users receive bids for household projects they have posted to the site from local service professionals, often within an hour or two. Though small at a $35M run rate in sales, it is growing quickly, up 50% from last quarter.Impressive as these growth stats are, they are obfuscated in some degree by the transition to the non-term structure. The company also recently sold its Eat 24 business to delivery partner GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), which has a distortional effect on the company's numbers. Accordingly, the consolidated financials only point to ~12% topline growth rather than the 20% plus run rate the ongoing business is currently generating. The Yelp financial model is a strong one, as the company enjoys strong gross margins of ~94%. With only moderate selling expense associated with each new sale, ~40% of incremental sales fall to the bottom line. Capex is similarly light at just ~3% of sales, meaning the company can easily direct resources to other growth initiatives or shareholder-friendly uses of capital. With ~$800M in cash on the books, the company is in a strong financial position. The CEO and founder owns ~$100M of stock and, after some recent changes in executive compensation, is now only taking a salary of $1 per year. With shares trading at 2.5x EV / Sales or 14x EBITDA versus peers at considerably higher multiples, we believe the company is well-positioned to compound investor capital at high rates of return over the coming years.New Position - As we are currently establishing a position in a second platform company, we will hold off on providing its name at this exact moment. But like Yelp, the company has a proven CEO with a strong track record and is also undergoing a change where consolidated financials do not currently portray the whole picture. Looking through these changes, we see another asset-light company emerging with impressive double-digit topline growth and high incremental margins. Unlike Yelp, this one is much smaller in terms of market cap, only lightly followed by sell-side analysts and trades with approximately half of its market cap in cash on the books. We look forward to updating you on this one in due time.DEST - Destination Maternity is the world's largest designer and retailer of maternity apparel. Like many retailers, the company thrived in the 1990s and 2000s with growing same store sales and an increasing store footprint as malls and shopping centers proliferated across the country. Also, like many retailers, the company has struggled over the last five years as Amazon and the growth of the online channel have diverted sales away from brick-and-mortar locations and left many participants with too many stores and bloated and under-absorbed cost structures. Unlike most other retailers, the company was further plagued by poor management and questionable corporate governance practices that did not always position shareholders and management with aligned incentives.This past winter, a team of activists identified these issues and waged a battle for control of the company. An ugly proxy battle ensued, but the activists emerged victorious and have since installed an impressive new board and a CEO with solid retail and turnaround experience.There is much work to do, but there is much to build on. Despite the recent issues, the company maintains an impressive customer list with a market-leading share in a category known for customer loyalty. The company has a store base of ~1,000, comprised of ~400 company-operated locations and ~600 leased locations inside department stores. The stores operate under the three banners: Motherhood Maternity, Pea in the Pod and Destination Maternity. Together, the company earns an impressive 50%+ gross margin but has an SGA margin that is worst in its class. Combined with a store footprint where ~50% of the stores will be up for lease by the end of 2019, it seems there is an opportunity for addition by subtraction for the company. Additionally, the company has been late to the eCommerce game. But recent initiatives there auger well there too. The online channel has grown from practically zero a year ago to nearly a quarter of the sales mix today and is still growing at a high teens rate. Our conversations with the new CEO point to a team that is intent on furthering these initiatives and cutting costs to create a leaner and more profitable company.Recently changing hands at a little north of $4 per share today, the company is trading at 5x FY2018 EBITDA and .4x sales, versus peers who generally trade around 6-8x and 1-1.5x TEV / sales. The activist case suggests improved performance could again position the company to soon earn $2 as they nearly did in 2013. It is unclear if this outlook may prove optimistic. But even if new management is able to get half way there towards the goal of $2 of EPS, it seems shares still represent a compelling bargain.Shorts/Hedges/ETFs - Ending the quarter, we continue to hold a few small short positions in four ETFs, as well as some cash from recent sales we look to deploy opportunistically in the near term.Outlook - From an economic perspective, we do not have too many meaningful changes to report in our broader investment views from last quarter. The economy continues to grow, and earnings growth continues to be very strong, likely coming in above 20% again for 3Q 2018. However, soon the arithmetic effect of the tax cuts will dissipate, and earnings growth will optically slow. But while the rate of growth may be peaking, the economic picture continues to be bright and supportive of further solid earnings growth into 2019.From a market perspective, the placid environment of 3Q, which had no daily moves in excess of 1%, have given way to choppier conditions, and stocks have begun to sell off entering 4Q. This go-around, small cap stocks are leading the markets lower. The Russell 2000 recently entered ""correction"" territory and is now off over 10% from its highs just over a month ago. Many stocks in the market cap-weighted index have fared worse, with over half of the stocks in the index off 20% or more. With rates going up, some change in the estimated value of the expected future cash flows of these companies is certainly warranted. But with over 1,000 stocks down over 20% or more in just the last month, it seems markets might be throwing out a few babies in all that bath water.If past precedent is an indication, our stocks will not be immune to the decline, and we will participate in the selloff to some degree. But with prices down and earnings up, bargains are likely developing. Our charge is to find them, and we have several in our sights. As in prior selloffs, we are more than happy to deploy cash or swap out existing holdings for higher-returning opportunities. As in prior selloffs, we expect our portfolio will again be likely to emerge with higher prospective returns. As stated earlier, if we are right on our assessments, we will be rewarded in due time.In closing, while I know our approach will not yield outperformance each and every quarter, I continue to believe it will be well worth our while over the long haul. Perhaps more importantly, given the majority of our investable assets are invested alongside yours, we would never ask investors to assume risks we ourselves will not. Thank you for your continued support as we work to grow our capital together.As always, we are happy to discuss our investment outlook with you at your convenience. Please reach out any time.Best regards,Mitchell Scott, CFAPortfolio Manager1. All market and company data is sourced from FactSet and company filings and is current as of 9/30/18.2. CEF uses the S&P 500, Russell 2000, a custom Blended Small/Large Benchmark and the Barclays Hedged Long/Short indices as its primary benchmarks. The S&P 500 and Russell 2000 are common large- and small-cap US equities-based indices. The custom Blended Small/Large Benchmark is provided to capture a larger proportion of small-cap performance versus large-cap performance (at a 3:1 ratio) due to the similarly high proportion of small caps found on the Good Businesses Focus List as well as the strategy's general preference of having an investment mix more heavily weighted towards investment in small caps. The Barclays Hedged Long/Short index (an index of equities-based hedge funds) serves as an appropriate benchmark over the long term given the index has a similar long-term goal of capital appreciation through equities investing.3. CEF Net Returns are hypothetical results calculated from actual gross results in a manner consistent with the 1% management fee and 18% performance fee offered to clients.APPENDIXCEF GOALS, PHILOSOPHY, APPROACH AND ALIGNMENTGOALS - Our primary objective is to outperform the Russell 2000 and S&P 500 over a multiyear time horizon and grow investor capital at the highest and safest after-tax rates of return achievable in pursuit of methods consistent with our value investing discipline. Additionally, we seek to communicate with our investors in a transparent and straightforward manner and ask only that they accept investment risks that we ourselves are willing to take. Given the majority of our investable capital is invested alongside theirs, we invest our limited partners' capital as if it were our own, because it is.PHILOSOPHY - We approach investing in public equities as an opportunistic businessman would. We spend most of our time studying businesses and building circles of competence in areas likely to offer attractive investment prospects and invest in only our most compelling opportunities. We view risk primarily as the likelihood of a permanent impairment of capital and pursue a carefully balanced willingness to trade some short-term portfolio fluctuations for the opportunity to earn higher returns over the long term. We focus on growing, understandable businesses and seek to buy them at a substantial discount to our estimate of their intrinsic value. When we find them trading at attractive prices, we often act in size and weight our best ideas accordingly. And all things being equal, we prefer to devote more of our efforts to small stocks where we believe greater price/informational inefficiencies can often be found.APPROACH - We invest via a long-bias hedge fund structure and concentrate our long investments in our best 10 to 15 ideas. Our work begins with a three-year outlook, and we only pursue investments we believe offer us a reasonable chance to double our money or better. While we pursue long-term oriented investments and seek to compound capital in a tax efficient manner, we readily acknowledge the often-turbulent markets do not always fit neatly into this framework and know some trading activity is sure to follow as a result. In the short book, we seek to generate absolute profits in a few stocks where we have uncovered a company entering financial duress or an excessively optimistic valuation where we feel their earnings outlook is likely to worsen materially. We will also use industry- or market-specific ETFs to mitigate market risk and will look to employ options and other opportunistic hedges when conditions appear favorable.ALIGNMENT - We believe appropriate alignment of interests is the bedrock upon which all successful partnerships are built. Our primary means of ensuring proper incentive alignment is through significant co-investment of our personal wealth alongside our limited partners. Secondarily, we offer an investor-friendly fee structure. We charge a modest management fee to support investment operations and charge an annual incentive fee on new profits only. Finally, commensurate with our fee structure, which is intentionally structured such that the majority of fund earnings will be earned only if we generate compelling investment results, we commit to operating the fund as a boutique shop with a limited asset size. As many of our best investments often come from small stocks, we believe it is important to preserve our ability to take concentrated positions in our best ideas. Our size and structure ensure we are incentivized to generate compelling returns, not gather assets.Think of it this way. On the one hand, we are incentivized to generate the best investment results possible. On the other hand, we are unwilling to invest in a way we feel is likely to result in a meaningful loss of our own investment capital. What more could one want from an investment manager?Editor's Note: This article covers one or more microcap stocks. Please be aware of the risks associated with these stocks."
4197052,22148,2018-08-09T12:31:47-04:00,Yelp smashes Q2 results.The new no-term contract shift led to a record 17.1K new paying advertisers that will fuel future growth.The stock continues to trade at a cheap EV/S multiple.,"Yelp (YELP) plunged following Q1 results surrounding concerns of moving towards no-term contracts. My bullish thesis concluded that the market had again got the story wrong and the move would actually expand advertisers and lead to higher growth. The market has remained far too bearish on the consumer review site with consistent advertising revenue growth in excess of 20%.Image Source: Yelp websiteThe lifeline of an advertiser business is having a customer base willing to pay for their services. Trapping customers into a term contract helps plan the business and lock-in revenues, but it also can constrain the amount of customers willing to try the platform.The trend in Internet advertising has long shifted away from term contracts thereby allowing customers to spend on a more flexible basis. Seasonal businesses don't have to worry about meeting a contractual monthly amount and regular businesses can spend on the platform that works the best. In essence, a platform like Yelp shouldn't fear no-term contracts as the site drives consumers effectively to restaurants and home services that advertise on the platform.Yelp traded up towards $48 on several occasions in the last year, but dipped as low as $37 as the market extrapolated too much on the irrational fears of the contract shift. After all, the company added a record 14,000 new paying advertiser accounts in Q1 and followed up those results with an incredible 17,100 new accounts in Q2.Source: Yelp Q2'18 shareholder letterAnother prime reason to move advertising to no-term contracts is the vast difference in the claimed local business locations versus the paying advertising accounts. The June ending quarter had 4.6 million claimed locations and only 194,000 paying ad accounts. Only 4.2% of claimed locations advertise on the platform providing easy targets with the new contract model.The theory is that any lost revenue from not locking a large customer into a term contract will be made up by adding thousands of new accounts. Not to mention, the salesforce has a more efficient time signing up new customers and those customers are likely more happy than under term contracts.Each and every quarter, Yelp grows the advertising business by over 20%. The company has made a lot of deals to either sell the Eat24 business or buy Turnstyle that convolutes the total business numbers in the transaction and other services categories.Regardless, the core business continues to surge while the stock price has gone nowhere since originally trading down to $40 back in 2015. On a pro-forma basis, revenues grew 22% in the last quarter. The no-term contracts should even provide a catalyst for accelerating revenue growth over the next year as all of these accounts slowly ramping up ad spending.Either way though, Yelp continues to trade at a very cheap EV/S multiple. The market might sweat the competitive landscape or the shifting business model, but the stock should be valued on the actual business performance.Prior to Q2 results, Yelp only traded at about 2.5x forward sales estimates. The figure had only dipped in the last quarter while the other ad revenue comparison in Twitter (TWTR) and consumer review site in TripAdvisor (TRIP) had seen multiple expansion at higher levels than Yelp.YELP EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsRemember that we're talking about a company generating large adjusted EBITDA figures and has a cash balance of $803 million. From a financial picture, Yelp isn't a risky play.In fact, the stock is possibly the only consistent 20% grower trading at such a low EV/S multiple. TripAdvisor is hardly even growing these days and the market loves that stock this year.The key investor takeaway is that Yelp remains an exceptional bargain as the market over extrapolates every possible opportunity. The solid Q2 results and Q3 guidance should boost the stock over the next quarter. Yelp remains a bargain trading in the mid-$40s."
4202189,103480,2018-08-27T07:23:16-04:00,"Yelp shares have leaped from their August lows after posting strong Q2 results that smashed Wall Street expectations on the top and bottom lines.Though shares are up sharply in August, they are still flat to last quarter, suggesting further upside is possible - especially with Yelp's low valuation multiples.The big driver of outperformance this quarter was growth in ad sales. Yelp switched to focus on non-term advertising, which has produced many new accounts.Accounting for the strength seen in Q2, Yelp also significantly boosted its guidance range for the year.","One unexpected trend that happened in the Internet sector this quarter is the fact that large-cap, heavily popular names like Netflix (NFLX) and Facebook (FB) have seen massive pullbacks from their all-time highs as key metrics and guidance miss Wall Street estimates. Yet, as these perennial favorites fade, money is rotating into the names that have supposedly gone cold - names like Pandora (P), Etsy (ETSY), and Yelp (YELP) - slower-growing Internet names that were once thought to be past their heyday.Yelp, in particular, is incredibly compelling due to a low valuation. In recent quarters, Yelp's management has also taken a hard look at its business mix and reshuffled its priorities. It sold the eat24 ordering platform to GrubHub (GRUB) (for a whopping $287.5 million, which is a significant portion of Yelp's <$4 billion market cap) and completely exited the transaction space. Then, management decided to completely overhaul its advertising business and focus on ""non-term"" ads. This strategy has worked, and despite no longer having eat24's revenues in the mix, Yelp is still growing on the top line while seeing massive profitability boosts.In essence, Yelp has returned to advertising as its core focus - and recall that, as a hyper-localized platform that places ads for local businesses and franchises, Yelp is not completely boxed out by Internet giants like Alphabet (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) for advertising space. An ad on Yelp fulfills a different set of needs and caters to a different customer channel.Amid this recovery, Yelp shares are up sharply - more than 30% - from August lows. Yet since last quarter, Yelp shares still have barely moved - and for year-to-date in 2018, Yelp's performance has also lagged behind that of internet peers.YELP data by YChartsIt's in these kinds of names - laggards with strong recovery potential and a renewed focus on core fundamentals - that I see the most opportunity for the second half of 2018. With the market racing to new all-time highs, a shift in inventor sentiment toward growth names might reward those who shift their portfolio into more value-oriented plays. In that regard, I think Yelp is one of the best value picks in the Internet sector at the moment.One of the important updates we got from management this quarter was Yelp's renewed focus to ""non-term"" advertising. This essentially means selling ads without any pre-determined contract length - previously, Yelp had many accounts sold on a 12-month contract basis.Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp's CEO, noted the following on the earnings call:The key point to note is a record number of customer additions (aka, a record increase in the number of advertisers). Yelp drove 17,000 net new customer additions in the quarter, bringing the quarter-end total to 194,000 paying advertisers, up 31% y/y. For a company whose growth has supposedly gone cold, a 31% increase in the paid customer base sure seems to refute that point. For reference, here's how large the 17k net add this quarter is compared to previous quarters:Figure 1. Yelp account addsSource: Yelp investor relationsAdvertising revenues also grew 21% y/y in the quarter to $226 million. With eat24's transactional revenues out of the picture, core advertising has returned as Yelp's main focus - and this shift to non-term advertising appears to have resonated with Yelp's advertiser base. This, in my view, is as good of a bullish signal as any.Here's a view of Yelp's revenue mix in the second quarter - advertising drove all of the growth, and was able to counteract the near elimination of transactional revenues:Figure 2. Yelp Q2 revenue mixSource: Yelp investor relationsHere's a look at the company's full results for the second quarter:Figure 3. Yelp Q2 resultsSource: Yelp investor relationsRevenues grew 12% y/y to $234.9 million, surpassing Wall Street's expectations of $232.1 million (+10% y/y). Note that the biggest optical driver of the low-teens growth rate is the fact that eat24's ~$15 million of revenue got erased from the picture. Adjusting for the eat24 sale, Yelp's revenue growth would have been 22% y/y - in line with last quarter's adjusted growth rate of 22% y/y.The key growth element to note is that advertising revenues grew 21% y/y as previously discussed, as this will return to being the predominant business going forward. Non-term advertising has been the key draw here as discussed in the prior section, with Yelp noting that its sales reps signed on 3x the amount of new-to-Yelp advertisers as they did in 2Q17. These accounts may start off at small dollar amounts - but as they continue to ramp at Yelp, they can evolve into significant clients.Note also that while it's still a small portion of overall revenues, Yelp's ""other"" revenues, consisting of Yelp Reservations and NoWait, are evolving into a more important and high-margin piece of the business. Other revenues grew 35% y/y to $5.2 million in the quarter - small compared to the total, but at a much faster growth rate. Possibly the more salient metric to note is that diners seated via these platforms more than doubled from 2Q17 to 2Q18:Source: Yelp investor relationsOn the bottom-line front, Yelp didn't make too much progress on operating margins as it still is focusing on expanding out its sales headcount to drive growth. Sales and marketing costs rose 15% y/y to $120.7 million, consuming 51% of revenues this quarter (one point higher than 50% in the year-ago quarter). On the sales force expansion, Yelp's COO Jed Nachman noted the following:Still, the company's adjusted EBITDA rose about 10% y/y to $47 million, far surpassing Wall Street's estimates for $41.2 million. Pro forma EPS of $0.12 also completely outpaced Street expectations of $0.01. Yelp was also pleased enough with its profit performance this quarter to raise its full-year EBITDA guidance to $186-$192 million - a $5 million bump at the midpoint and a significant boost relative to Wall Street expectations of $184 million.Don't think of Yelp as down for the count just yet. The company still has a few tricks up its sleeve, as it demonstrated this quarter by switching the structure of its advertising sales approach to drive tremendous growth in new accounts. Among internet companies that are undervalued relative to their potential, Yelp - at just barely over 3x forward revenues - is one of the first names that comes to mind."
4185145,22148,2018-07-02T17:04:54-04:00,Yelp continues to face a determined competitor in Google.The consumer review site continues to produce consistent 20% growth in consumer reviews and local ad revenue.The stock trades at a ridiculous EV/S multiple of 2.5x.,"For years now, Yelp (YELP) has dealt with Google (GOOG, GOOGL) trying to copy features, block access to the consumer review site and steal customers. The company will survive and thrive the latest explore features in Google Maps, making the current stock weakness ridiculous and part of the ongoing bullish thesis.Image Source: Yelp websiteThe privacy issues surrounding the big internet giants like Alphabet are a prime reason that consumers will continue going directly to the Yelp app, even if one could argue that the latest updates were better than Yelp. The site has a very loyal user base that's now insulated from the tactics of Google due to the direct use of the mobile app.Google Maps announced the new explore tab features about a month ago. The features went live on June 26 per this post on Twitter.The app has some neat features including ""Your Match"" that ranks restaurants based on your history and highlights the restaurants one has visited on the trending lists.A lot of the neat features require consumers to trust Google with data that the company will use elsewhere to advertise to the user, whereas Yelp specifically uses any data collected to reach consumers solely for the purposes of recommending places to visit. Yelp doesn't have an outside business that will use the data to target consumers.Regardless of the long-term efforts of Google, Yelp continues to maintain consumer content that is growing and irreplaceable. In the last quarter, cumulative reviews were up 22% and app unique devices using the service are now above 30 million.Source: Yelp Q1'18 shareholder letterCumulative reviews continue to generate consistent growth with over 50% growth over the last two years:No matter what Google attempts to do to replace Yelp, these cumulative reviews on the platform are irreplaceable. Yelp can't just be replaced as customers increasingly don't trust the Internet giants and the consumer review leaders have the historical content to attract and retain users.Investors will look for commentary on the Q2 earnings call about additional competitive threats including these feature updates to Google Maps, but one won't see any anecdotal evidence until Q3 numbers with the update going live so late in the quarter.Some of the weakness in the stock was due to how the market doesn't handle transactions very well. Selling Eat24 to GrubHub (GRUB) reduced the reported revenue growth rate and boosted the cash balance, but the underlying local advertising business is still growing at 20%.Delivery order revenues from the partnership with GrubHub should start boosting the growth rate again. Historically, Yelp has grown unabated which should change the conventional wisdom that Yelp is a highly volatile business facing constant competitive threats. The revenue chart shows consistent and unabated growth regardless of the competitive threats.Anybody looking at the revenue chart over the last five years would pay a rather large multiple of sales for that type of consistent 20% growth. A cloud software stock with 20% growth would trade somewhere over 5x sales estimates.Yelp on the other hand trades at a meager EV/S multiple of 2.5x. The stock has consistently bottomed around these levels.This multiple is increasingly protective of a bottom with the stock below $40 due to Yelp ending March with a cash balance of $830 million. The company has in essence $9 per share in cash and is repurchasing shares on this weakness.The key investor takeaway is that Google will always try to break into the local ad market based on consumer reviews, but Yelp remains the clear leader. The company has the content that users want, generating the consistent revenue growth that makes the stock cheap.Use the weakness to buy the stock alongside the company."
4188959,53292,2018-07-22T08:26:52-04:00,"Yelp currently has higher revenue per Monthly Active User (MAU) than Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat did when they had similar traffic.
        Yelp's business page upgrades allow for extra revenue that Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat can not capture.
        With a market cap of just $3 billion, not much has to improve to make Yelp worth billions more.
        Next quarter's earnings will provide a big clue if momentum in advertising growth is sustainable.","First, a point needs to be made clear. I am not arguing that Yelp (YELP) is or will become Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), or Snapchat (SNAP). Currently, Yelp is much smaller than its social media competitors:All of these numbers come from the companies' most recent 10-Q reports, which are linked to at the bottom of this article.* - Snapchat does not provide MAU numbers, only daily active users (DAU, which is 191 million). This is estimated based on Facebook's MAU/DAU ratio, and in line with estimates from other sources.** - Based on a sum of monthly unique desktop, mobile web, and app users.Facebook currently has about 1.4 billion monthly active users, Yelp has just 10% of that.Facebook is worth $600 billion, Yelp is worth 0.5% of that at $3.3 billion.So why even give Yelp time of day?It is easy to cast Yelp aside as the forgotten social media network, but Yelp has quietly carved out a very popular niche in advertising that I think many don't realize. It probably comes as no surprise that Facebook is dominating when it comes to monetizing their user base:These are based on the MAU numbers in the table above, and the revenues are based on the companies' latest 10-Q filings.Social media networks depend on scale. Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat can reach more people and collect more information than Yelp can currently. It is no surprise that they are able to collect such a premium per user today.But these are more mature companies than Yelp.When you look back at what these companies were doing when they were the size Yelp is today, something stands out:* - This estimate is based on Snap's Q1 2016 DAU users (122 million), which I used to estimate MAU (184.89 million) using the same method in the first table above. This information is found in Snapchat's most recent 10-Q.When it comes to monetizing users, Yelp is already ahead of where Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat were when they were Yelp's size.First, do a search on Yelp for a restaurant or service near you and you will be presented with several types of ads:Yelp charges on a CPC (cost per click) basis for these ads. These ad sales are fairly straightforward. Businesses set monthly budgets to spend on Yelp's platform, and Yelp serves up ads to users. I think of these ads are just like the ads you see in your Facebook or Twitter timeline.But there is more to Yelp than restaurant ads. Yelp has found a way to monetize not only the ""timeline"", but business pages as well. This is a source of income that Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat do not have, and this is what gives Yelp it's superior revenue generating ability.Every single business on Yelp has options to upgrade their page:Want to restrict your competitor's ads from showing up on your page? Showcase your best pictures? Or make it easier to convert viewers? That will cost as much as $75 per month. (A business can ""A La Carte"" these options for the price shown, or pay $75 per month to get all these features).As Yelp grows in popularity, businesses will have to be on Yelp. As more and more businesses know that potential customers are searching through Yelp, more and more businesses will be looking to highlight themselves to potential customers.We are seeing this trend already play out. Over the last 2 years, the number of businesses and the number of advertisers has increased proportionally:Source: Yelp's Q1 2018 10-QThe number of new businesses that have been claimed on Yelp is up 56%. Over the same period of time, the number of advertisers on Yelp is up 49%.This is where Yelp has an immense advantage over its competitors. It has figured out how to monetize the company page on social media and, thankfully for Yelp, the number of businesses on Yelp is growing rapidly.Investors are too focused on traditional user growth because that is how other social networks are making their money. Yelp does generate revenue from its users, and Yelp does need to continue to increase its active users, but Yelp also has an additional source of income from businesses. That is the fastest growing part of Yelp, and also what brings in a large amount of money on a monthly recurring basis.As Yelp becomes more popular, not only should we see an increase in CPC ad sales, it should also lead to more recurring revenue from business pages. I believe these dual sources of income will allow Yelp to continue to grow its revenue per MAU, even though its traditional user growth is much slower than Facebook, Twitter, or Snapchat.Since they were Yelp's size; Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat have grown their total Revenue per MAU by 455%, 97%, and 259%, for compounded annual growth rates of 21%, 15%, and 89%, respectively.What would similar growth in Revenue per MAU mean for Yelp?If Yelp grows their MAUs by just 5% per year over the next five years and grows its Revenue per MAU at the same rate that Twitter has over the last 5 years (the worst performing of the social networks), Yelp is looking at $540 million in revenue in Q1 2023, and at least $2.16 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2023.If total costs and expenses rise at 10% per year over that same period (The same rate they rose from Q1 2017 to Q1 2018), Yelp makes $660 million before taxes in 2023.Assuming a 15% effective tax rate and a P/E of just 20, that puts Yelp's market cap at $11 billion, more than 3 times what it is now. $660 million may be pocket change for Facebook. But for this little company that has found a way to monetize what the others can not - it is a huge opportunity.Of course, there is no guarantee that Yelp can continue to monetize their traffic at the same rate in the future. I see one risk to Yelp's model that the next quarter's earnings announcement should help resolve:The one trend that I don't like is the company's ""repeat rate"", which is the number of advertisers that are paying for ads this year compared to last year.Source: Yelp's most recent 10-QFirst quarter of 2018 saw a big drop in Yelp's repeat rate. This came just as Yelp rolled out its new advertising policy of offering non-term advertising contracts. Previously, you would sign a contract for a certain amount of advertising for a certain period of time. Now, advertisers can set their budgets, and start and stop ads at their choosing.The change in advertising policy led to a 85% increase in the growth of advertisers on the platform in the last 3 months.Source: Yelp's most recent 10-Q.I think the policy of opening up Yelp ads to those looking for a smaller commitment makes sense and has the ability to get many more small advertisers on the platform. But it certainly adds the potential for volatility in the company's advertising revenue, and I believe we are seeing that with this decline in Yelp's repeat rate.I am looking to next quarter's earnings to shed some light on whether this new advertising policy is working, and if they are doing better at keeping advertisers on the platform.Yelp's new advertising model is unproven, they haven't reached the scale that other larger social media networks have, and they don't have the growth in users that investors are used to seeing with Facebook, Twitter, and Snapchat.But Yelp has one thing figured out that the other networks do not - how to monetize a company page.Yelp doesn't get the spotlight that Facebook gets since Yelp receives a fraction of Facebook's traffic, but Yelp doesn't have to become the next Facebook for investors to benefit. With a market cap of just $3 billion today, I believe investors are seriously underpricing the potential value of Yelp even under modest growth scenarios.Yelp is showing promising signs that it is already ahead of where its competitors were in their early stages. If Yelp can learn a little from its competitors on traffic generation, hang on!Sources for this post:Facebook's Q1 2018 10-QTwitter's Q1 2018 10-QSnapchat's Q1 2018 10-QYelp's Q1 2018 10-QFacebook's S-1Twitter's Q4 2013 10-QSnapchat's S-1"
4182811,73185,2018-06-20T09:38:55-04:00,"Yelp stock has underperformed peer tech stocks by a substantial amount in 2018.This weakness is not a buying opportunity.Competition looms large over Yelp, and cracks are already starting to form in the foundation.","Despite the broader market, and specifically tech stocks, posting solid gains thus far in 2018, one stock which hasn't been so lucky year to date is Yelp (NYSE:YELP). The argument for where shares will go next is quite polarizing. Bulls are saying to buy on this weakness. Bears are saying this is the beginning of longer-lasting weakness in shares.With respect to Yelp, we find ourselves on the bearish side. We don't believe this platform has staying power as the go-to restaurants rating aggregator, and believe bigger platforms with more reach will inevitably erode the company's user base. We are already seeing this happening (its overall user base dropped year over year last quarter), and we believe this is only the beginning. Yelp stock isn't priced for this reality, and as such, shares look risky here and now.YELP data by YChartsWe fail to understand the fundamentals supporting the bull thesis on the stock. We recognize that Yelp arguably has staying power as an opinion and rating aggregator of different restaurants. But that staying power is at risk to competitive threats from multiple angles, the business isn't that defensible, the class of ""Yelpers"" who drive the value of the platform is niche and not growing all that much, revenue growth isn't that robust for a digital ad player, and the digital advertising landscape is only growing more competitive. Considering the short list of pros and long list of cons, we do not think the present valuation of 33x forward earnings, bigger than both Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) forward multiples, makes any sense.YELP PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe biggest problem with Yelp is the increasing competition in the opinion and ratings aggregation game, and the lack of defense the company has to fight off such competition. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Facebook, and Alphabet are all making big pushes into the reviews space, and their platforms are gaining traction. Moreover, the name of the game in opinion and ratings aggregation is size. Presumably, the bigger you are, the more opinions/ratings you have and the truer your overall sentiment gauge is.From this perspective, Yelp is in trouble. Between mobile web unique visitors, desktop unique visitors, and app unique devices, its ecosystem numbers under 174 million users in total. Moreover, Yelp has 155 million reviews and 177,000 paying ad accounts.By comparison, Yelp's competitors are far bigger. Facebook has 2.2 billion monthly active users and over 6 million active advertisers. Amazon has over 100 million Prime members. Google processes somewhere around 3.5 billion searches per day. Thus, if and when Facebook, Amazon, and Google turn on the engines in their ratings aggregation initiatives, they have the potential to make Yelp largely irrelevant due to scale.This is already happening. The aforementioned number of 174 million total users (app unique devices + desktop visitors + mobile web visitors) is actually down 2% year over year. That means that in grand total, less people are using Yelp today than a year ago. This isn't an anomaly, it is a trend. Over the past several quarters, total user growth has slowed from 12% to 11% to 8% to -2%. This slowing user growth trend is a red flag that indicates that competition is indeed taking market share away from Yelp. Because of the size discrepancies between Yelp and its competitors, this market share shift will only worsen in the foreseeable future.The two big positives of Yelp are that revenue growth is accelerating and the loyal class of ""Yelpers"" remains as loyal as ever. Advertising revenue growth last quarter was 20%, versus 18% in the prior quarters. Meanwhile, total paying advertiser accounts rose 27% last quarter, versus 21% in the prior quarter. Also, despite negative overall user growth, cumulative reviews on Yelp rose 22% last quarter, implying that loyal users remain as loyal as ever.These are big positives that imply staying power both for Yelp's platform and the advertising business. But staying power won't drive big growth. Indeed, 20% revenue growth is rather anemic for an advertising player of such small scale. Facebook, by comparison, reported ad revenue growth of 50% last quarter on a significantly larger base.Unfortunately, revenue growth will only get slower. Over the next several years, Yelp will maintain its core group of ""Yelpers"", but growth outside of that demographic will be limited and perhaps negative as users use Facebook or Google more and more to discover restaurants. Advertising growth will remain positive from a small base, but outsized growth without big user growth will be tough to come by. That is especially true considering that the digital ad landscape is only getting more competitive.Therefore, today's 20% advertising revenue growth will inevitably slow over time as the user base maxes out and Yelp starts to rub elbows with some major ad players. The net result, at best, should be ~15% revenue growth over the next 3-5 years, assuming competitors don't steal users en masse and advertisers don't flock to Facebook/Google/Amazon en masse. Margins have struggled for gains recently, and those struggles should persist given the rising competitive risks. But some margin expansion is possible in a best-case scenario with 15% revenue growth, and that should drive 20% earnings per share growth. Assuming 20% earnings growth per year over the next 5 years, Yelp should be able to net around $2.30 in EPS in 5 years in a best-case scenario. This is relatively consistent with the current consensus earnings growth trajectory.YELP EPS Diluted (TTM) data by YChartsLet's aggressively assume that in 5 years Yelp gets a Facebook/Google multiple of 26x forward earnings. A 26x multiple on $2.30 EPS implies a four-year forward price target of ~$60. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a present-day value in the lower $40s. Thus, in a best-case scenario of 20% earnings growth and Facebook/Google valuation in 5 years, we believe Yelp stock is fairly valued at present levels.That isn't a great set-up, especially against the backdrop of multiple risks which, in sum, imply a low probability of the aforementioned best-case scenario materializing. Thus, we attribute a low likelihood of Yelp being worth $40 today and a high likelihood of it being worth substantially less than $40. That combination makes Yelp stock look rather risky here and now trading above $40."
4175641,103480,2018-05-19T12:21:17-04:00,"Yelp shares initially fell after posting strong Q1 results, but shares have quickly recovered since.The company is closing the valuation gap to the rest of its Internet peers and the rally still has legs.Aside from strong organic growth in Q1, Yelp also added its largest-ever number of paying advertiser accounts in the quarter.Unlike many of its Internet peers, Yelp also remains profitable on an EBITDA and cash flow basis.","Over the past several years, a stark dividing line has essentially cleaved the Internet sector into two halves - the Wall Street favorites like Netflix (NFLX) whose valuation keeps surging and sends shares doubling almost every year, and has-been companies like Yelp (YELP) which still see some modest share price appreciation, but are treated by investors like old industrial companies that have lost their touch.Yelp has had decent performance in the year to date, rising about 10% and beating the broader market, which is essentially flat. Yelp's performance, however, pales in comparison to other internet names - Twitter (TWTR), for example, is up nearly 40%, and Netflix is up 70%. The valuation gap between Yelp and its internet peers has widened over the past several quarters, but I believe Yelp is on an upward trend to close that rift.YELP data by YChartsOf course, Yelp is no longer a growth stock. Its mid-teens revenue growth certainly doesn't merit the 8-10x revenue multiples that its high-flying internet peers are trading at. But is Twitter's current valuation at 3.2x forward revenues, as shown above, the right price for it either? This isn't a company that has just simply stopped growing - yes, it's slowing down its growth trajectory, but it's also transitioning into becoming a profit machine.This quarter, Yelp didn't make any improvements in its operating margin due to investing a significant amount of R&D dollars into its product development, but the company still managed to keep Adjusted EBITDA margin flat and grow it by 10% y/y, unlike last quarter where the company saw a dip in EBITDA margins. Additionally, the company's ~$300 million sale of Eat24 to GrubHub - though a near-term headwind to revenue comps - shows that the company is focused on unlocking value in its assets for investors, and not simply chasing growth or empire-building.Yelp still has many innings left in its recovery. Though Yelp is no longer the coolest internet company on the block, it's certainly one of the stocks with the best value in the sector. As the markets rediscover volatility this year, I believe growth-oriented investors will shift more into value, and high-flying names may see a correction in their valuations. Take cover by investing in more undervalued names like Yelp. Buying rebounds in the internet sector has proven to be a winning strategy this year - aside from Twitter's recovery, Pandora (P) is another good example, having risen 50% in the year-to-date after strong Q1 earnings. This was a company investors had once left for dead.Remain long on Yelp and focus on the company's conversion into a more stable-growth, higher-margin business.Here's a look at the results of Yelp's first quarter:Figure 1. Yelp Q1 earningsSource: Yelp investor relationsRevenues grew 13% y/y to $223.1 million, outpacing Wall Street's expectations for $220.3 million (+12% y/y) by a hair. While 13% revenue growth doesn't sound overly impressive, note that Eat24's $17 million of revenues are consolidated in the year-ago quarter.Adjusting for the sale of Eat24 and removing its contribution to 1Q17 results, Yelp's revenues would have grown by 22% y/y - certainly a respectable organic growth rate, and one that merits a valuation multiple in excess of 3.1x forward revenues:Figure 2. Yelp adjusted revenuesSource: Yelp investor relationsWhat I find particularly encouraging is also the fact that Yelp is pursuing additional opportunities beyond advertising, which has been and still is the largest driver (>90%) of revenues, especially after the sale of Eat24, which provided transactional revenues from order delivery.Of course, advertising still remains the core of the Yelp franchise in the present day. One of the most impressive metrics in the quarter was the fact that Yelp added 14k paying advertiser accounts in the quarter, bringing the total base of advertisers to 177k at the end of Q1, up 27% y/y. Yelp attributed this success to increased sales productivity, which are the magic words investors want to hear for just about every technology company:Source: Yelp investor relationsOne caution, however, surfaces with Yelp's user metrics. Yelp saw a dip in both desktop and mobile MAUS to 73.7 million and 69.9 million, respectively. While 1Q17 was a particularly difficult comp, the trend is still an important metric to watch. Because Yelp drives the majority of its revenues from advertising, it effectively doesn't matter how many more advertisers it signs on if users and clicks decline:Figure 3. Yelp MAU trendsSource: Yelp investor relationsOn the cost and profit side, Yelp took product development costs up to 23% of revenues, up from 20% in 1Q17. Total GAAP operating losses of -$4.8 million stood at a -2% margin in the quarter, roughly flat from the same period last year. Despite the uptick in costs, however, Yelp managed to grow its Adjusted EBITDA (its primary profitability metric) by 10% y/y to $33 million, representing a flat 15% EBITDA margin:Figure 4. Yelp adjusted EBITDASource: Yelp investor relationsYelp's Q2 guidance, which calls for adjusted EBITDA of $39-$42 million on revenues of $230-$233 million, also implies an improvement in the EBITDA margin to 17% next quarter. Note also that Yelp's pro forma EPS in the quarter of -$0.03 beat analysts' expectations of -$0.05.Yelp initially took a tumble after posting these strong Q1 results, but even though shares have recovered since, they are still a long ways toward reclaiming a ""normalized"" valuation. While the company has become less of a growth machine in recent years, it has pivoted successfully into becoming a cash flow and EBITDA generator that, in the near future, could be seen as an attractive acquisition target.I have confidence in Yelp's ability to continue growing its business at a stable pace and managing continued earnings growth. The Q1 earnings dip leaves open a nice opportunity to buy shares in an undervalued name."

We came up with this value based on a 50% weighting on our DCF valuation and a 50% weighting on our comparable companies valuation.","Analyst: Matthew WestWe believe Yelp's (NYSE:YELP) flat performance over the last year has not been reflective of their future growth. The switch to non-term contracts will be perceived by smaller businesses as less risky of an investment. As a result, business owners will be more likely to use Yelp's services. Yelp is also doing a great job maintaining a stellar mobile platform. They are ready to take advantage of market trends suggesting users are going mobile. Margin expansion will be driven by increased efficiency in operations after the sale of Eat24 to GrubHub. We also see potential in Yelp's Request-A-Quote feature which has shown good performance in the last quarter. Yelp's balance sheet is debt free, and there is significant cash built up making them able to grow through acquisitions should the right company come along.Yelp is a business review site focused on providing customers, primarily in North America, with local business information. They also provide local business owners with a variety of touchpoints with purchase-intent driven consumers. Connecting consumers with local businesses of all sizes while providing a convenient user-friendly platform for interaction among all stages of the purchasing process is Yelp's overarching mission. They achieve this by offering several main products and services, including advertising, transactions, and other services. By offering these products and services, they can integrate themselves into each part of the consumer's purchase cycle. The purchase cycle includes several stages: need/want recognition, gather information, evaluate options, buying decision, purchase, and post-purchase. Yelp targets each one of these areas by offering customers a platform that includes discovery, content, engagement, interaction, transactions, and retention and analytics. Their unique advantage is in the fact that they have reliable information and reviews all accessible on an easy to operate mobile app. Replicating the quality and quantity of reviews Yelp has is difficult. It takes a large number of users to write the reviews, and people are only going write them if there is a community to engage with. Source: Q2-2018 Shareholder LetterAdvertisingSince 2009, Yelp's advertising segment has accounted for, on average, 90% of top-line revenue. In their most recent quarter, Q2-2018, this number has increased to 96% after the sale of Eat24 to GrubHub. Although they have a very concentrated amount of revenue focused on advertisements, their services within this segment are very diverse. Yelp offers a range of accounts to business owners. The cheapest accounts cost owners nothing while enhanced profiles allow business owners increased functionality and control over their business listing page. Yelp has also taken the effort to make it less intimidating for business owners to pay for advertising services by transitioning to non-term contracts on their advertising plans. Businesses who may have been too small or who were averse to the longer commitment involved in a traditional paid advertising plan can now assess Yelp's platform to grow their business. This strategy allows Yelp to get more businesses in the door. Once they are in, they can see statistics, trends, and the performance of their listing, and if Yelp does a good job providing them the analytics and reach their businesses' needs, it will be hard for owners to go back to their traditional advertising tactics. We are optimistic about Yelp's ability to retain business on these non-term contracts given the reach, attention, and volume the platform creates for local business owners.Source: Q2-2018 Shareholder LetterTransactionsAfter the sale of Eat24 to GrubHub, Yelp's transaction revenue has been limited to the Yelp platform ordering service, Yelp Deals, and gift certificates. As a result of the divestiture, Yelp's revenue in this segment has been cut by 80%. Although they did lose some revenue from the sale, we think the long-term strategic thinking was of sound judgment. Yelp's core competencies are not strongest in the transaction business. Yelp's key resources revolve around intellectual property. Their main focus is to create high-quality content for engaged communities. Capturing data and using that with their proprietary technology is what they do best. By divesting non-core operations, they can focus more energy on maintaining and evolving those systems. Additionally, by returning to their core activities, Yelp can decrease resources, energy, and time previously spent on their transactions business which will lower their operating margins.Source: Q2-2018 Shareholder LetterOther ServicesYelp's other services segment is their smallest segment, accounting for around 2% of top-line revenue. In this segment, Yelp generates revenue by selling subscription services and license agreements for access to data and other analytics information. Other services include Yelp Reservations, Yelp Nowait, Yelp WiFi, and Yelp Knowledge. These services help businesses operate in the 21st century by enabling them to accept bookings online and manage those reservations through their business listing on Yelp. It also empowers business owners with the ability to gather information on their customers. They can use Yelp's WiFi service to gather information on customers logging on. We see huge potential for growth in their other services segment as advanced data analytic techniques are explored by Yelp's research and development team. Another area we see growth in this segment is the continuation of acquisitions that are related to helping businesses increase retention and loyalty of their customers. We think the probability for growth in acquisitions is likely for several reasons. Yelp has shown the capacity to successfully integrate acquisitions in the past. Two recent examples include Nowait and Turnstyle Analytics. 113% increase in diners seated via Yelp Reservations and Nowait demonstrate Yelp's ability to integrate acquisitions smoothly into their operations. The amount of start-up companies has increased significantly over the past few years. Over 16% of the adult population aged 18 -64 in North America are in the process of or have started a business that is less than 42 months old. Another 7.9% and 7% of the same population are currently involved in entrepreneurial activities, which the later percentage have been paying salaries and wages to the owners for more than 42 months. Yelp has a healthy balance sheet with over $380 million in cash and over $410 million in short-term marketable securities. As they take profits from all-time highs in the market, this will increase their cash balance further, and in the case of a market correction or recession, this will put them in a good position to take advantage of cheap acquisitions.Source: Q2-2018 Shareholder LetterYelp operates in the internet media and information industry but is also affected by many other industries in which its customers and users engage in. The internet media industry is highly competitive and is growing as access to and use of the internet increases. The home and local, restaurant, and beauty and fitness industries are Yelp's major ad revenue sources. Each industry is affected by consumer spending which is driven forward as the standard of living improves.Industry RivalryThe internet is an accessible platform for anyone to access or utilize at a very low cost. This means companies must be extremely creative when attempting to set themselves apart. Some important factors in keeping a sustaining advantage are sticking to a clear niche market, social recognition, ability to leverage influence and create advertising partnerships, attracting top talent, and protecting intellectual property. Yelp has positioned themselves well in each of these factors. They have stuck to their niche market of local business information and reviews. They have widespread social recognition reflected by growing traffic on their platform and growing cumulative reviews. Yelp's ability to leverage their user base by creating advertising partnerships with local businesses has been proven by a steady increase in local advertising accounts. Headcount at Yelp has also increased with hires in technology development and sales as both areas get investment. Yelp has stated its primary investing activities are going towards purchases of marketable securities, purchases of property plant and equipment to support the ongoing build-out of leasehold improvements for their new facilities in San Francisco and New York, purchases of technology hardware to support their growth in headcount and internally developed software to support website and mobile app development, website operations and their corporate infrastructure. They have also indicated they expect these investments to increase in 2018 compared to 2017.Source: Q2-2018 Shareholder LetterOver the past 3 years, Yelp has invested significant capital in research and development into search and ranking technology, recommendation software, mobile solutions, advertising technologies, infrastructure, and network security. The search and ranking technology uses data stored on their platform to provide users with contextual, relevant and up-to-date results. This ensures their platform continues to return relevant results that make for a convenient user experience. We think that Yelp has positioned itself well in the industry by creating a platform that protects itself from competitors and offers users a distinct value.Key External DriversKey external drivers for the industry are internet traffic volume, number of mobile internet connections, total advertisement expenditure, and the number of broadband connections. We find evidence to suggest each one of these drivers is going to continue to grow and provide more opportunity for Yelp to monetize their services in creative ways. The increased use of the internet has made online advertising more attractive to businesses. For Yelp, this trend is super important because we still haven't seen a shift in total advertising expenditure moving online. For investors, this is good because it means there is still room for Yelp to grow. Currently, the U.S. local ad spend is $149 billion with the largest segment being direct mail accounting for $37 billion. Mobile and online advertising together make up that amount. Other large expenditures include newspapers ($16B), TV ($21B), radio ($16B), and cable ($7B). As technology continues to change the local business landscape, the industry will see a massive influx of ad spending being driven through online and mobile platforms. Yelp is situated very well to take advantage of this trend as it is a mobile-first platform and has built a user base which is large enough to make it attractive for business owners to see the value. There is also evidence from related industries like TV and radio, travel, and hiring that show the way we interact in all facets of our life is going online.Source: Investor PresentationNetwork EffectsYelp's platform is only useful to consumers if there is a large amount of reliable information available. Yelp can control some of that by listing as many businesses as possible in each local area. However, their team only has so much capacity before it becomes an inefficient use of their capital and time. This is what makes their crowdsourcing model so important. By empowering the public to make reviews and suggestions on current or new business listings, they can grow their platform without having to increase their costs in proportion to the amount of information being created. In other words, the model is scalable, meaning the value created grows at a much faster rate than the capital invested to create that value. Although it may seem like an easy model to start, there is a problem that occurs when there is a dependency on users for content. The problem is, what comes first, the user base or the content? There cannot be one without the other. This is what gives Yelp a big advantage over competitors and possible new incumbents in the industry. They have already established a network of users and content which is growing on its own. This ecosystem can be used by other business functions, like food delivery, or added by introducing complementary products and services to enhance the user experience (Yelp Nowait). The possibility for monetization through partnership, acquisition, or product development is only limited by management's execution capabilities. We see the Yelp platform situated at the center of the local business ecosystem in which all consumers and business owners interact with daily. As each of these groups grows, it feeds more value into the ecosystem making each other group grow and repeating the cycle.Proprietary TechnologyYelp's mobile-first mindset sets them apart from similar companies like TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) who are known to run their platform on desktop websites. This is especially important since users who are looking for local businesses are frequently on the go. They need a platform that is easy to use and accessible. Even though consumers can get anything online on their phone, it doesn't mean it is easy to use. Yelp has optimized its app design to display information in an easy to access and understandable fashion. They have integrated multiple proprietary systems in their service which make a huge difference in the user experience. These systems include search and ranking technology which provides users with contextual, relevant and up-to-date results for their search queries. They also have recommendation software and other advertising technologies that optimize results for local businesses and the user experience. Lastly, Yelp is integrated into many other mobile websites and apps like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). They frequently come up as one of the top results when people are searching for local business reviews. This advantage is hard to replicate because of the complexities of Google's search algorithms. Yelp's platform for business information and reviews is validated by users, and they have relevant content relating to users' searches. This makes their results extremely hard to beat.Source: Q2-2018 Shareholder LetterSticky and Expanding Non-Term ContractsWith the recent switch to non-term advertisement agreements, Yelp has allowed more business owners to sign up without making a big commitment. Smaller local businesses experience more turnover and have smaller budgets for advertising than do larger franchises and business. Most of these smaller businesses are struggling to keep the doors open and aren't going to be interested in taking a risk in an advertising app they may not fully understand. By allowing the sales team to close deals without a fixed contract, it allows these smaller business owners to have exposure and see what it is like to use Yelp's platform.Source: Q2-2018 Shareholder LetterWe think this strategy is great because it now enables Yelp to target businesses who may not be around for too long and still be able to extract value from them. We also see the potential to upsell and create dependency on the Yelp platform. Once business owners sign up, they are given access to view analytics about their businesses page and projections on other information useful to business owners. Results have proven that Yelp has helped in driving sales. Four out of five users stated that they visit Yelp when they are prepared to spend money and 35% of Yelp users visit the searched business within 24 hours. Local businesses will become accustomed to the traffic and availability of information they get through Yelp. At the very least, they will continue their contract with Yelp, if not upgrade their services.Strong Cash Balances Used for Growth InitiativesSince Yelp is a debt-free company, it can use its free cash flows to pursue growth objectives without the drain of debt on its cash balance. Yelp has a history of making smart acquisitions that have complemented its current product and service offerings. An example is Nowait, a waitlist system, and seating tool. It further increased the functionality of the Yelp platform for users and gave more incentive for business owners to register with Yelp. Future acquisitions like these can help Yelp increase the value they add to consumer and business owner experiences, further growing the Yelp ecosystem by enhancing existing operations and leading business from the existing network to these new experiences.Source: Q2-2018 Shareholder LetterStock RepurchasesStrong cash balances allowed Yelp to repurchase 1.6 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $65.8 million, reflecting an average price of $41.13. If management continues to buy back shares, this is a signal that the shares are at an attractive price. The board of directors has authorized up to $200 million of outstanding common stock to be repurchased. Since Yelp is putting a significant investment in property plant and equipment, technology hardware, website operations, and corporate infrastructure it shows they are still taking action to set the company up for growth in the future and not just repurchasing shares for the sake of bringing their cash balance down.Increased Traffic Due to the Integration of GrubHub's Restaurant NetworkManagement has indicated that with the recent sale of Eat24 to GrubHub, they have created a partnership where Yelp receives a fee for any online order placed through the Yelp app that goes to GrubHub. Yelp will not generate as much revenue as if they owned Eat24 themselves. However, this means they also do not have to maintain Eat24 and assume all the risk associated with food delivery. Another positive is that by allowing GrubHub to manage the logistics of delivery, Yelp can focus on what they do best; bringing information and word of mouth online. In the last quarter, we have seen the positive effects of this strategic move. Order-enabled restaurants on Yelp have increased from 42 thousand to over 80 thousand. The partnership with GrubHub has granted them access to GrubHub's network of order-enabled restaurants. Yelp will make less revenue on each transaction compared to when they managed their own delivery service, but the access for consumers to more order-enabled restaurants will create more value for the company in the long-run. Yelp's business model relies on having the largest network of users possible. This makes it attractive for local business owners to pay Yelp for advertising services. The more value and convenience Yelp can offer through its platform to consumers, the more value they can extract from their customers as the reach and influence of their service has become larger. We believe the market has focused on the 80% decrease in transaction due to the sale of Eat24 to GrubHub. Investors have not considered the positive aspects or the partnership with GrubHub. Once they realize Yelp gets access to GrubHub's network and that this will drive more traffic to Yelp's platform, in turn making it more attractive for local businesses to advertising on Yelp's platform, will we see an appreciation in the share price.Strong Performance of Request-A-Quote FeatureYelp's request-a-quote feature has driven growth in their largest and fastest-growing business segment, Home & Local Services. Lead volume growth of 27% and revenue attributable to Request-A-Quote growth of 50% are all signals to show the market is reacting positively. We believe Yelp is on track to create a norm for Home & Local Service businesses to offer the Request-A-Quote (RAQ) feature. Right now, the Request-A-Quote feature is a point of differentiation for local business, those who offer the RAQ will be more successful in closing business than those who do not. In the future, being able to estimate what a service might cost from the comfort of your phone.Revenue ForecastsRevenue has been forecast based on revenue growth in local advertising, transactions, and other services segments. We have forecasted revenue growth in the next 18 months to grow at a higher rate than in our long-term 5-year estimates because of an initial influx of ad revenue due to the switch to non-term contracts. Historically, Yelp has experienced close to 60% total revenue growth year over year; however, in recent years, they have only been able to grow 20% year over year. We think that going forward, they will be able to, at a minimum, maintain these levels, if not grow faster as more monetization of products and services occur. In FY2018 and FY2019, we expect 21% and 35% revenue growth, respectively. From 2020 onward, we decreased our estimates to around 18% revenue growth year over year. We believe this is achievable, given their past track record of high revenue growth as well as recent upgrades in guidance in the most recent press release.CostsAfter the sale of Eat24, operating costs shrank as Yelp had to spend less maintaining systems Eat24 required. They were also able to maintain the same EBITDA margin. We were conservative in our estimates projecting COGS of 7.5% when they have recently dropped down to a level of around 6%. We were also heavy on R&D reflecting our view that Yelp will be spending more on developing new systems and making current ones better. S&M and G&A were kept in line at 50% and 10%, respectively, as we think compensation for administrative roles and sales and marketing will remain around similar levels it has in the past. Our reasoning is that with all of this considered we have projected an EBITDA margin of 14.5%. This EBITDA margin is lower than it has usually been in recent times; however, we would like to err on the side of caution rather than be overly optimistic.Depreciation and AmortizationIn our projections of depreciation and amortization, we have utilized a depreciation schedule on a straight-line basis. Taking into consideration the historical useful life of PP&E, we have come up with an estimated useful life of 2.5 years. We have assumed this useful life does not change through our projections into 2023.Capital ExpendituresCapital expenditures were forecasted somewhere in between historical lows and highs. We think the company is going to continue to invest in their future by improving their technology and infrastructure. However, we do not think projecting 40% capex would be realistic. There will be periods where they do spend more than others but on average we think 20% is a reasonable assumption.Effective Tax RateYelp's effective tax rate has been somewhat inconsistent since in some periods they have negative net income. We have projected a 5% tax rate as we think this keeps the absolute value of tax expense at a reasonable level taking into consideration the tax expense in historical periods.Weighted-Average Cost of Capital (WACC)Since Yelp is a debt-free company, we have used the cost of equity as our discount rate. Taking into consideration multiple factors that affect our inputs to the cost of equity, we have come up with a discount rate of 8.5%. This is made up of a risk-free rate of 2.9%, an expected market return of 8.75%, and a beta of 0.95. The risk-free rate we have assumed is slightly higher than what the 10-year treasury bill is currently at and this reflects our view on rising interest rates in the near future. The expected market return is a bit lower than the performance of the S&P 500 historically and we think this view is based on the current all-time highs in the market we do see being corrected.We think Yelp's performance over the last few years has been unfair to their potential for future growth as ad spending continues to move to mobile and online applications. High growth technology stocks have cast a shadow over smaller names like Yelp. Once the market realizes there is more value in these lesser known names, Yelp's true value will be achieved. We believe Yelp offers consumers a value proposition they cannot get elsewhere and that they have protected their competitive advantage by creating a platform that has proprietary technology backing the user experience, making it hard to replicate. We also see the recent switch to non-term contracts to be attractive to many smaller businesses which are on tight budgets and perceive longer-term contracts to be too much of an investment. Once Yelp gets people in the door, it will be hard for them to leave, and we believe in Yelp's ability to maintain these non-term contracts through the pure value they add to local businesses. Yelp's investment in other services such as the request-a-quote feature also proves their ability to monetize the business model in a variety of different ways. Going forward, we believe Yelp will be able to continue this innovation and acquire or develop their own new systems to utilize the audience they have already built.RecessionWith the markets experiencing all-time highs for such an extended period, it is inevitable a recession will hit sometime in the near future. For consumers, this means less spending on discretionary goods and services like eating out and shopping. Business owners are affected in two ways, the first being through decreased demand and the second through lower ad spending budgets. To combat this, Yelp can use their cash on hand to buy businesses at a discount or find employees in the market who are willing to work for lower wages.Delivery ServicesThe recent influx of food delivery services could take revenue away from the restaurants segment as more local restaurants are putting investment into working with food delivery services. Additionally, since food delivery platforms give information on local restaurants they can easily add a review feature to the service and customers no longer have a need to go to Yelp for that word of mouth validation. To combat this, Yelp will have to find new ways to add value to their customers' experience on their platform. One way is to focus more on other business besides restaurants where they have already been experiencing the most sales.Exhibit 1: Valuation SummaryExhibit 2: Income StatementExhibit 3: Cash Flow StatementExhibit 4: Balance SheetExhibit 5: WACC Calculation and Sensitivity AnalysisExhibit 6: DCF AnalysisExhibit 7: Comparable Companies Analysis"

The company is constantly shifting around the business via transactions that tends to lose investors in the complexity of the quarterly results, but the recommendation remains to not ignore the opportunity in the stock in the mid-$40s.Source: Yelp Q1'18 shareholder letterInvestors need to look far beyond the reported top-line growth of 13%. Selling the Eat24 business to GrubHub (GRUB) set up the company with a huge cash balance of $830 million and caused a hit to reported revenues. The key is that advertising revenue surged 20% and total revenues grew 22% on a comparable basis when excluding transactions that also included the purchases of Nowait and Turnstyle.Ironically, Yelp made a big shift in the ad model to focus on no-term contracts. The stock supposedly dropped 8% in trading on the day after earnings for this reason, but all of the key metrics are supportive of this move.Eliminating the 12-month contract reduces the friction in new customers trying the Yelp platform for the first time and reduces the challenge for seasonal advertisers. The net new paying advertiser accounts grew during the quarter at a record rate of 14K, and Yelp added about 3x the accounts as last Q1. Very impressive expansion of the starting point for revenue generation.Source: Yelp Q1'18 shareholder letterThe company ended with 177K paying advertiser accounts and far below the amount of accounts on the platform. The 27% YoY growth rate in the quarter accelerated beyond the 20% ad revenue growth rate suggesting Yelp is building up a base for expanded growth in the next year as these new accounts ramp up spending.At the end of 2017, Yelp listed 20 million local business locations with over 4.2 million locations claimed on the platform. These claimed locations provide an easy funnel for paying advertiser accounts and eliminating the contract should help alleviate the friction in the ad paying rates sitting below 5%.Source: Yelp Q4'17 presentationNo matter how one slices the valuation equation for Yelp, the stock is cheap. When compared to a social media site focused on ad revenue like Twitter (TWTR) or another consumer review site focused on travel like TripAdvisor (TRIP), the stock now trades at the lowest multiples of either EV/Revenues or EV/EBITDA.The multiples with TripAdvisor are similar, but Yelp has a significantly higher growth profile. TripAdvisor only grew revenues by 1.6% in the last quarter and a fraction of the growth rate of Yelp whether one uses the reported or adjusted number.YELP EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThe EV/EBITDA multiple is the most similar amongst the group. Yelp is investing a lot of the savings from dumping Eat24 into restaurant business lines at an EBITDA cost of $25 million this year. The multiples are comparable, but arguably, Yelp has considerable upside due to faster growth.YELP EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that Yelp is an easy stock to buy on dips. A company with over 20% local ad revenue growth should trade at a premium multiple to the market. Remember that the stock plunged following the Q4 report in early February to only rebound to multi-year highs before reporting Q1 results. Look for a similar rebound this time as the market again realizes that local ad growth is very appealing to the market."
4145606,103480,2018-02-12T08:55:22-05:00,"Yelp continues its slide downward despite a substantial beat to analyst expectations in Q4.The chief cause of Yelp pessimism is its Q1/FY18 outlook, which despite beating top-line estimates is soft on EBITDA guidance, implying margin contraction.Investors have been down this road with Yelp before; the company has a tendency to guide low and set reasonable targets.Yelp delivered plenty of upside in Q4 relative to targets given in Q3, so there's no reason to believe FY18 will be any different.","Yelp (NASDAQ: YELP), the local business-reviews site that is most commonly associated with local restaurants, continues to shed points on the stock as the company recedes further into a downtrend that it began in late November. Despite modest growth and growing profits, as well as a widespread sentiment that the company is undervalued (despite some observers decrying Yelp as a ""dead"" platform, its user traffic metrics don't appear to align to that belief), Yelp stock is down nearly 10% this year, following the broader markets down despite strong results in Q4. Note also that Yelp's performance stands in stark contrast to trading comp GrubHub - although GrubHub's business model is quite different as a delivery network, the two companies have long been intertwined in small ways. Yelp, in Q4, finalized its sale of its eat24 food-delivery subsidiary to GrubHub for $287.5 million - twice what it paid for the company in 2015. While this is a win for GrubHub, whose larger-scale network can operate eat24 much more profitably than Yelp, it should also be considered a win for Yelp shareholders as well. Yet GrubHub continues to soar as Yelp seems to find no bottom to its pain:YELP data by YChartsOf course, no one is under the illusion that Yelp is a growth machine. The company has long stopped growing at the kind of rates that Silicon Valley investors salivate over. But when you look at Yelp and its core business of local business reviews, it provides a niche ad platform that doesn't have too much overlap with Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), the twin giants of internet advertising. As I wrote in a prior article, investors are still adjusting to the ""new normal"" at Yelp, which involves a slower pace of growth and an increasing focus on EBITDA. But the platform isn't worth nothing: user traffic growth suggests that the company is still massively appealing to a certain audience, and that audience is still capable of bringing in growing ad dollars.So we're at an awkward juncture with Yelp again, with investors more focused on next quarter's guidance over this quarter's results. While for most companies this is a valid view, with Yelp, we've seen from experience that the company's guidance isn't too reliable as it tends to gravitate toward the conservative side. Yelp's management doesn't mind tanking the stock around earnings season in order to publish reasonable targets that they can crush in the coming quarter - time and again, this pattern has been repeated.With the correction in Yelp entering a second inning, Yelp's valuation is even cheaper than it was last quarter, especially after refreshing its FY18 guidance (note that while EBITDA guidance trailed analyst expectations, the revenue outlook was positive. For a company like Yelp, revenue is probably the better yardstick of underlying performance, while the volatility of quarter-to-quarter EBITDA can lead to an unexpected beat). Yelp's current valuation multiples of ~2.5x EV/FTM revenue and 12.9x EV/FTM EBITDA, in the context of a hot internet sector, is a hard-to-find deal (multiples shown in charts below).The right thing to do is to buy the dip, especially as the market continues to test monthly lows. Over the long run, Yelp can improve its story to the markets and convince investors of the longevity and quality of its platform again - recall, too, that Twitter (NASDAQ: TWTR) was once declared dead and traded under $14/a share, and has since rebounded more than 2x. Investors have short memories: today, many are claiming Twitter as a ""high-conviction"" pick in the sector, on the back of its first profitable quarter. While Yelp isn't yet there, it's also not that far away, especially as the eat24 subsidiary it unloaded to GrubHub was a drain on profits. To illustrate the power of a rebound in internet names, take a look at how Twitter's valuation has advanced far past Yelp's in the past year:YELP EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsContinuing on with the notion that investors have short memories, let's rewind back to Q3 and review what Yelp had stated in terms of Q4 guidance:Analysts considered this to be weak guidance, and revised their estimates downward accordingly, causing a 5% tumble after Q3 earnings. Yet it seems rather that Yelp is an excellent manager of expectations, because it delivered $218.2 million and $41.6 million in revenue and EBITDA, respectively. This exceeds the revenue guidance range and landed at the high end of the EBITDA guidance range.The company also beat analyst expectations for revenue by $3.3 million and its pro forma EPS of $0.19 smashed consensus of $0.05. See the company's earnings summary and EBITDA bridge below:Figure 1. Yelp Q4 income statementFigure 2. Yelp Q4 EBITDA walkdownSource: Yelp Q4 earnings releaseRevenues only grew 12% this quarter (versus 19% last quarter), but we have to remember that the sale of eat24 closing in Q4 played into this lower growth number. And before investors scream outrage at the low double-digit growth number, recall that Twitter posted only 2% revenue growth in Q4, results that investors applauded and rewarded with a high valuation multiple. (I also think Twitter is a fantastic rebound play - but the valuation gap between it and Yelp is noticeably enormous).Adjusted EBITDA took a bit of a tumble in the quarter, losing 4% of margin and declining 8% y/y - but note that the company's full-year EBITDA is still up 30% y/y. Give Yelp some time to digest its acquisitions and divestitures, and it will return to expanding its earnings margins.Note also that Yelp's traffic metrics in the quarter were strong - user traffic, more than quarter-on-quarter fluctuations in EBITDA, should be viewed as the harbinger of Yelp's long-term success.Figure 3. Yelp traffic metricsSource: Yelp investor relationsUnique desktop visitors are up 13% y/y to 76.7 million. Mobile visitors were roughly flat y/y, but with app installs up 20% y/y to 28.8 million unique devices, growth in mobile visits should resume a robust trend.Strength in Q4 numbers, however, was outweighed by the perception of a weak outlook in FY18 - despite no broad indication that Yelp's fundamentals would enter into a slowdown this year. The following slide, taken from Yelp's Q4 earnings presentation, summarizes its guidance for the year:Figure 4. Yelp FY18 guidanceSource: Yelp Q4 earnings deck (the * denotes that guidance figures already remove eat24 revenues)Yelp's revenue guidance midpoint of $950 million represents 12% y/y and was actually in-line with analyst consensus of $951 million. Its EBITDA midpoint of $181 million represents 15% growth and is lower than consensus of $196.4 million.For Q1, the company has set revenue and EBITDA guidance of $218-$221 million (again, in-line with analysts at $219.4 million) and EBITDA of $29-$32 million (below analysts at $38.4 million). Shares lost approximately 15% from recent peaks on the news.For Yelp observers, this situation should seem painfully familiar. Yelp continually gets crushed for guiding low - yet because it continues to guide low in every quarter, it never really gets rewarded for beating its guidance. The result is a company whose valuation keeps sliding - especially in relation to other recovering internet peers, like Twitter.There are plenty of reasons to put your chips down and bet on Yelp while it can be had for a song. Yelp has become a controversial stock of late, with bulls harping on the bargain-basement valuation and bears firmly believing that Google and Facebook will soon supplant it completely.Yet the point must be made again - it wasn't too long ago that bears were saying the same thing about Twitter, with a widespread belief that Facebook and Snap (NYSE: SNAP) would eventually drain out Twitter's entire user base. In recent days, however, Twitter has proven itself to have a core user base around which it can build a slower-growing, but profitable business. This is exactly the narrative that Yelp needs to latch onto, and with traffic figures still up amidst low double-digit revenue growth and EBITDA expansion, this scenario is highly possible."
4131418,103480,2017-12-12T15:46:54-05:00,"Yelp shares have been under pressure lately, as a miss in Q4 guidance led to a stock price tumble despite a beat in Q3 earnings.Yelp's guidance range of $211-216 million was ~$20 million below analyst consensus of $234.3 million. A large portion of this guidance was due to the sale of eat24 to GrubHub.Yelp is set to generate positive GAAP earnings for the full year; in FY16, it was still in a net loss position.Yelp's operating cash flows are also up 56% y/y in the year-to-date period.Shares are cheap at 2.8x EV/FY18 revenues and 10.2x EV/FY18 OCF.","Though Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) get all the attention in the internet advertising world, it's important to remember how unique of an asset Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is. With its hyper-local focus, large following, and user-generated content, Yelp gives advertisers an extremely concentrated, high-ROI site to spend ad dollars.From an investment perspective, there's a lot to like about Yelp that's not present in the majority of the FANG giants. The first is its balanced financial profile - while Yelp's revenue growth of ~20% y/y pales in comparison to Facebook's 50%, Yelp has begun turning the margin lever and is expected to generate positive GAAP profits in FY17 and FY18. While its GAAP earnings base is still too small to provide a basis for valuation, its massive and growing cash flows provide plenty of support for the company.Valuation on the stock is cheap - especially after considering the tumble that Yelp has suffered over the past month since reporting earnings. Though Yelp beat Q3 estimates, confusion over Q4 guidance sent investors running for the hills. As mentioned in an incisive analysis by a fellow SA contributor, however, a lot of the noise surrounding Q4 guidance surrounds Yelp's sale of eat24 to GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) to $285 million - which removes about $18.5 million in quarterly revenues from Yelp, making up the majority of the difference between Yelp's guidance and Wall Street's not-updated models. It's important to remember that news of the sale initially sparked a run in Yelp shares, as Yelp made 2x on its initial purchase of eat24 two years back.Yelp is down 10% since reporting earnings, though it's still up year to date. Given the strength of Yelp's underlying business and its undemanding valuation, it's a top-notch pick for the internet sector in 2018.YELP data by YChartsYelp has moved out of the startup realm and become a safer play - with large and growing cash flows and EBITDA, and on the cusp of achieving GAAP profitability. With double-digit top line growth and a well-defined niche, Yelp should return to outperformance in 2018 as investors seek steady, value-oriented tech names with a combination of growth and profits.Most investors are probably familiar with what Yelp does, but perhaps not with its business model. At its heart, Yelp is a user-generated review platform. While it's mostly known for its reviews of restaurants, the scope of Yelp reviews is actually fairly broad, and restaurants represent only 17% of Yelp's reviews - and 15% of its revenue base. Yelp actually has a greatly diverse base of covered businesses, as shown in the chart below (taken from Yelp's Q3 earnings materials):Figure 1. Yelp revenue and reviews by categorySource: Yelp investor relationsAs of Q3, Yelp has 142 million cumulative reviews on its platform and 4 million business pages. It also counts 83.6 million monthly average unique desktop visitors (+17% y/y) and 73.5 million monthly average unique mobile visitors (+2% y/y), the rough equivalent of MAUs (monthly average users) for a social media company like Facebook. While Yelp's user base is no longer exploding, it has managed to grow its traffic on a y/y basis every quarter since the beginning of 2017, despite the age and saturation of the platform. The chart below shows how Yelp's user metrics have trended over time:Figure 2. Yelp traffic trendsSource: Yelp investor relationsYelp monetizes its traffic via three revenue streams. Like most internet businesses, advertisements are the main source of revenues for Yelp, generating more than 90% of its revenues. While it's free for a local business to create and maintain an online Yelp page, Yelp offers premium placements (""sponsored"" search results) and enhanced profile pages with embedded photos or video to businesses which are willing to spend advertising dollars.Yelp has a direct sales force to sell ad inventory to customers. As of the end of Q3, Yelp had 155,000 paying business accounts (+17% y/y), and a repeat rate of 79% - meaning that 79% of Yelp's advertisers purchased more ads within a 12-month span.Yelp has disclosed that in the first year since signing up a new local advertiser, the typical account generates a contribution margin of 48% - a relatively low return, accounting for the cost of the sales effort to land the client. In years 2 and beyond, however, each account generates an average contribution margin of 95% - and given Yelp's high repeat rate, it shows how sticky and scalable Yelp's advertising platform can become.With more than 20 million local business locations in the U.S., Yelp is less than 20% penetrated into its market - and given that only 155,000 of these businesses are paying advertisers, Yelp still has plenty of room to grow. It sees itself as becoming the Yellow Pages of the digital age, similar to how Priceline (PCLN) has upended travel agencies and Spotify has upturned radio.In addition to ad revenues, Yelp also generates ""transaction revenues"" - which offer an assortment of gift card sales (from local business to consumers) appointment bookings, and event tickets, which Yelp facilitates for a transaction fee. Yelp's sale of eat24 to GrubHub was a major source of online food-ordering revenues, but while these revenues might ease in the short term, Yelp has also inked a long-term partnership with GrubHub. Yelp users can still sue the eat24 platform, and Yelp earns a cut of the transaction fee from GrubHub.Yelp also has a small but growing SaaS platform. For a monthly subscription fee, restaurants and other establishments can use Yelp Reservations to build a reservation system directly from Yelp. Yelp also has a data analytics offering called Yelp Knowledge, which provides a repository of local data insights and tools.SaaS revenues are still a small portion of Yelp's total (they generated $4.1 million in Q3, or 2% of Yelp's total revenues), but are quickly growing. Q3's subscription revenues were more than triple from the prior year's Q3. Though Yelp will likely always remain anchored as an advertising business, it's plausible for the company to expand into a vertical SMB software offering that provides restaurant management tools and ERP functionalities.Diving into Yelp's financials, we note that Yelp isn't in the superstar growth category anymore. Having launched more than a decade ago in 2004, Yelp is fairly saturated in terms of user traffic, though it still has plenty of head space for revenue growth via acquiring new paying business accounts.Yelp grew its revenue 19% y/y to $222 million in Q3, edging out over analyst consensus of $221 million. For the full year 2017, Yelp is forecasting revenue of $839-844 million, an increase of 18% y/y. The chart below shows Yelp's revenue trajectory over the past three years:Figure 3. Yelp revenue trendsSource: Yelp Q3 earnings deckWhat's especially attractive about Yelp, however, is its margins. As an internet business whose only real inputs costs are server expenses, Yelp has sky-high gross margins of 92%. The company spends the majority of its revenues (52%) on sales and marketing to acquire growth, but over time, it should be able to scale down its sales spending as it focuses on profits.Yelp generated $7.9 million in GAAP net income in Q3 (a 4% net margin), nearly 4x the $2.1 million (1% net margin) it generated in the prior-year Q3. Yelp's EPS of $0.09 in the quarter actually surprised analysts, who had been expecting a loss of -$0.02. The company hasn't yet had a full year of profitability, but with $0.13 in EPS year to date, FY17 looks like the first year of GAAP profitability for the company.Yelp's GAAP earnings, however, mask its cash generation capabilities - as a great deal of its expenses are in non-cash stock comp. In the nine months year to date, Yelp generated operating cash flow of $128.0 million (+57% y/y) and free cash flow of $107.8 million, double from last year's period.Yelp's Adjusted EBITDA metric is another good benchmark for the company's performance, which consists of standard EBITDA addbacks on top of stock-based comp. As Yelp's Adjusted EBITDA shows the company's cash earnings picture but strips out fluctuations in the balance sheet (a weakness of cash flow metrics), it provides a cleaner picture of Yelp's earnings capabilities. The bridge below shows Yelp's addbacks from net income to adjusted EBITDA:Figure 4. Yelp Adjusted EBITDA walkdownYear to date, Yelp has generated $115.0 million in adjusted EBITDA, up 54% y/y. For the full year 2017, Yelp is forecasting adjusted EBITDA of $154-157 million, implying 30% growth at the midpoint. Note that this guidance seems oddly conservative - after the sale of eat24, which was a loss-bearer, it seems highly unlikely that Yelp's Adjusted EBITDA growth would taper down from 54% YTD to just 30%. More than likely (unless a margin contraction is waiting in the wings), Yelp has set an incredibly easy benchmark to exceed in Q4.Figure 5. Yelp Adjusted EBITDA guidanceAt Yelp's current market cap of $3.42 billion (a share price of ~$41) and net cash position of $576.8 million (the company has no debt), Yelp carries an enterprise value of $2.84 billion.Let's now extrapolate Yelp's growth into FY18. Assuming Yelp's 19% y/y growth carries into FY18 - a reasonable target for the company to achieve, given the strong expected spend in the digital ad markets - Yelp will generate FY18 revenues of $1 billion. Yelp's actual guidance on the matter of FY18 revenues will be an important litmus test for the stock, but without this disclosure yet, $1 billion is a fair mark for the company.Let's also assume that Yelp's adjusted EBITDA can grow 40% in FY18. Given that year to date, Yelp has grown adjusted EBITDA 54% - and without the benefit of the seasonally strong fourth quarter - this is also a fair mark for the company. A 40% growth rate implies FY18 adjusted EBITDA of $217.7 million.Extrapolating Yelp's operating cash flow in the same fashion, assuming a 40% growth rate, also yields $277.1 million in FY18 OCF.Based on these assumptions, Yelp currently trades at the following multiples:All of these multiples point to an undervalued stock - especially with the rate at which Yelp's earnings are growing, and especially with the company pivoting to GAAP net income. Yelp's revenue multiple, in particular, sets it far below other high-profile companies in the internet sector:YELP EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsWith such high gross margins and earnings expansion potential, Yelp deserves to trade at a much higher revenue multiple, akin not only to the internet peers shown above but also to SaaS companies trading in the 6-7x range - especially as the subscription business begins to play a larger role in Yelp's revenues.A guidance mishap threw Yelp's stock into chaos in the past month. Investors who are willing to see past near-term fogginess, however, can benefit greatly from a stock that hasn't yet risen to unparalleled heights in 2017. As the tech sector and the broader market continue to set records each day, investors are increasingly looking for names that haven't yet seen cataclysmic appreciation.Yelp is a company with a well-defined niche and loyal following in its user base. As the company continues to ramp its sales force and generate growth from its headcount expansion, the company has a path to further expansion of its earnings. Its long-term target model - shown in the chart below - targets an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 35-40%, a vast expansion over the 19% seen in Q3:Figure 6. Yelp long-term operating targets With the consistent improvements Yelp has made in its margins each year, as well as the steady growth in its top line, Yelp looks like a solid long-term candidate whose current bearish sentiment provides a well-timed, Buffett-style window into investing in a fundamental winner."
4144519,22148,2018-02-08T09:21:47-05:00,Yelp beat analyst estimates though the stock sells off again.Key growth metrics continue growing at 20% levels.The stock is attractively valued with the potential for multiple expansion.,"Yelp (YELP) reported incredible Q4 results, yet the stock sold off similar to past quarters. Typical of the consumer review site, the market over reacts to investment decisions and ignores how the actual results tend to smash estimates. The up to 10% dip in after hours is another opportunity to own the stock that was currently trading down 5.5% to $42. The Q4 numbers were messy with Yelp selling Eat24 to GrubHub (GRUB) and incorporating results for Nowait and Turnstyle that were bought in 2017. Transaction revenue plunged while services revenue jumped, leading to a sequential decline in reported numbers. The important part is to focus on what Yelp has now after collecting the cash from selling Eat24 and building up the cash balance to $550 million. The consumer review site continues to grow key core metrics of cumulative reviews, unique app users and paying advertisers by 20%. The company reported the following YoY growth in Q4 for those key metrics:These numbers should drive investor appetite for the stock. The quarterly results, conservative guidance and shifts in business always causes investors to lose focus. If Yelp was burning cash, one might need to overlook its consistent growth in users and engagement. The company though smashed Q4 EPS estimates by earning $0.19 per share. For the year, Yelp earned $80 million in net profits and produced adjusted EBITDA of $157 million. What riled the market was the decision to expand in the restaurant category where revenues only account for 14% of total local advertising revenues in Q4. The company forecast operating losses of at least $20 million to expand the Reservations, Nowait, and Wifi Marketing programs in the restaurant sector. At the same time, the GrubHub partnership enhances the online ordering and delivery options on Yelp to 80,000 restaurants. Investing in these businesses shouldn't worry the market after Yelp generated a $165 million pre-tax gain on the original Eat24 investment. Investing for the future should be encouraged.Looking at the results over the last two years and in comparison to guidance and one sees a clear picture of Yelp growing at a consistent pace. Sure the new 2018 EBITDA target misses analyst forecasts for $196 million, but the consumer review site is still expanding numbers by up to $20 million and the miss comes from additional investment. Source: Yelp Q4'17 presentation As long as a growth company doesn't have any major red flags such as burning cash to grow, the more reliable and easy valuation metric is P/S. In this case, Yelp trades at multiples below the mega-cap Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) that has similar revenue growth from advertising revenue and a stock like Twitter (TWTR) that hasn't even been growing revenues. All of these companies have strong cash positions so a similar EV/S multiple would generate the same valuation equation in favor of Yelp. The numbers though continue to support that the consumer review site is constantly overlooked despite consistent growth in the core business in the 20% range. The company is on pace to reach revenues of nearly $1 billion this year, yet the market generally blows off the long-term opportunity. Only about 1.5% of the over 20 million local businesses in the U.S. are paying customers for Yelp. Source: Yelp Q4'17 presentation The key investor takeaway is that Yelp consistently grows and morphs the business for the future. The market constantly finds excuses for selling the stock despite the attractive valuation. Yelp belongs in any growth portfolio with the stock trading in the low $40s."

But if you read the fine print, that appears to be a stretch.According to Shaaban’s research, that number is pulled from leads, not conversions.“By assuming revenue based off of leads, you’re assuming 100 percent conversion off those leads, which obviously doesn’t make any sense,” he says in the video below.Even the number of leads is misleading as Yelp may be double counting leads, failing to take into account multiple leads from the same visitor.“These leads are not mutually exclusive. All of these are not necessarily one person. You can make a mobile call and look for directions,” Shaaban says. “All of this said, the ROI metrics are obviously misleading, if not, intentionally misleading.”Watch the video above for more."

The key to understanding the bullish investment thesis is digging further into the partnership with GrubHub (GRUB).The stock ended down 5% in after-hours trading after initially slumping more than 10%. Should investors actually buy this dip?The Q3 numbers were strong with a $0.07 EPS beat on an EPS of $0.29 and reported revenue growing nearly 20%. By all effective purposes, Yelp is becoming a local advertising machine and start to produce considerable leverage.The issue causing the stock to collapse surrounds Q4 guidance. Yelp forecasts revenues dipping sequentially to no more than $216 million following a quarter where revenues reached $222 million.Source: Yelp Q3'17 earnings releaseThe noteworthy difference was the closing of the Eat24 transaction on October 10 with GrubHub. The roughly $18.5 million in transaction revenues generated during Q3 will disappear in Q4 while the partnership revenue from GrubHub will slowly ramp into the 1H of next year.What the market missed is that EBITDA guidance jumped due to removing the operating losses of Eat24. Yelp forecasts 2017 EBITDA of $155.5 million, up from only $148.0 million provided along with Q2 results. At the time, the consumer review site even suggested a possibility of only hitting $143.0 million in adjusted EBITDA.Yelp now has a projected revenue run rate in the $850 million range and somewhere around $800 million in cash. The market cap will dip below $3.6 billion on a 5% drop tomorrow so the enterprise value is only $2.8 billion.The real story is exchanging the Eat24 transaction revenues for highly profitable food ordering revenue in partnership with GrubHub. Along with the Q3 results at GrubHub, my analysis highlighted how Yelp reported that Eat24 generated a roughly $4.2 million quarterly loss in the 1H of the year on sales of $17.25 million per quarter. Considering higher revenues in Q3 and Q4, the negative impact was likely smaller though Yelp should see some improvement in EPS results.The real unknown is the revenue potential for Yelp from the GrubHub deal. Any Yelp shareholder should find the bullish tone from GrubHub CFO Adam DeWitt on the earnings call as a very positive indication:So not only does GrubHub see significant growth potential from the partnership with Yelp, but also the ability to generate higher EBITDA per order. Such a scenario ensures that GrubHub will embrace the opportunity and ensure full implementation of the partnership.The key investor takeaway is that the market doesn't understand the Eat24 transaction. Yelp continues to deliver on strong growth and trades at a reasonable valuation of an EV/S below 3x 2018 sales estimates that will approach $1 billion depending on how GrubHub works out. Buy the dip though one should've loaded up during the summer."

Each week, we do the following:We also have some fun. We welcome comments, links, and ideas to help us improve this resource for traders. If you have some earnings season ideas, please join in!Our previous Stock Exchange considered whether the bull market was slowing. If you missed it, a glance at your news will show that the key points remain relevant.To frame this week’s discussion, here is quote about using stops to exit your trades from a recent edition of Charles Kirk’s, The Kirk Report:For some additional perspective on trading strategies, Valeriy Zakamulin adds a little order to the chaos in the field of market timing with moving averages in this article from Alpha Architect:Further still, Alpha Architect provides more insightful information in this article:Specifically, the article defines the concept of “volatility premium” and then goes on to describe several ways to capture that premium when you enter your trades.This week’s Stock Exchange is being edited by our frequent guest: Blue Harbinger (also known as Mark D. Hines). Blue Harbinger is a source for independent investment ideas focused on value and income opportunities.Homes: This week I like Franklin Resources (NYSE:BEN). This stock’s dip over the last month is the sort of set-up I like to see. From the chart below, you can see BEN is below its 50-day moving average, and just above its 200-day moving average. It’s also received support at $42 twice now, and the price has moved up this week. With limited downside and plenty of upside potential, I hope I’ve brought the humans a solid pick.Blue Harbinger: BEN is an interesting business, Holmes. It’s largely an active asset manager targeting mainly retail investors, as well as some institutions. Asset managers make money based on the amount of assets under management (“AUM”) they have (i.e. their fees are often a percent of AUM). So when the market goes up, BEN’s revenues go up. The trouble with Franklin Resources is that there is this huge and continuing wave of assets moving away from active funds and into passive funds; this is NOT good for BEN.Holmes: That is a nice story about Franklin Resources, Blue Harbinger. But my style is dip-buying mean reversion, my average holding period is six weeks, I exit when my price target is achieved, and I control risks based on macro factors and stops.BH: Well, Franklin Resources delivered slightly disappointing earnings on July 28th, and that’s why the shares have sold off. The company’s AUM was up $2.8 billion during the quarter. Specifically, AUM was up $10.1 billion due to net market change, but then lost $7.3 billion in net outflows - you know, investors moving their money elsewhere. Holmes, have you considered a nice passive manager, like BlackRock (NYSE:BLK)?... their assets under management will continue to benefit from investors moving to low-cost passive funds like the iShares they offer.Holmes: I could counter your argument by pointing out active managers (including Franklin Resources) have been increasingly beating their benchmarks this year, and also that the retail mutual funds business has an enormous contingent of relationship-driven clients that will never go to the cold, bare bones, solutions offered by BlackRock. But instead, I’ll just remind you that my edge is based on quantifiable mean-reversion and dip-buying, and I’ll stick to that. How about you RoadRunner, what do you like this week?RoadRunner: My most recent pick is RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) (NYSE:RH). I look for stocks that are at the bottom of a rising trading channel, and if you look at the chart below, you can see why I like RH. It’s been in a steady rising channel for months and may easily rise over $75 soon. I get in at opportune times, but only hold my position for so long - usually about four weeks.Blue Harbinger: RoadRunner, might I remind you that you have picked RH in the past, on both July 28th and on May 19th. Is there any particular reason you keep bringing RH to our attention?RR: Well, aside from the reasons I just told you (it’s at the bottom of a rising channel, and it looks good for the next four weeks) my quantitative system has a profitable track record of entering and exiting these names at the right time.BH: Okay, RoadRunner, then I’m just going to remind you of some of the things I pointed out last time you recommended RH. First, I don’t like RH. It’s a luxury home furnishings company that just completed an extraordinarily aggressive share buyback program. Specifically, they bought back nearly 50% of the shares outstanding in less than six months, and that drove the price to more than double, and it caused the price-to-earnings ratio to also increase dramatically (i.e., it looks really expensive).The company’s actions just seem very aggressive to me, especially considering it used some expensive debt to buy back the shares. And the market also believes there’s something odd going on here considering short interest is still over 50%! I just feel like this company could tank under even the slightest recession.RR: Feelings are important, but not when it comes to my disciplined and repeatable process. RH is attractive. Anyway, how about you Felix - what have you got?Felix: I like Yelp (NYSE:YELP). This stock has some powerful momentum on its side.BH: Interesting pick, Felix. It’s nice to see you finally bring an idea to the table after you had nothing for us last week.Felix: Unlike you humans, I don’t get frustrated and try to force things when the opportunities simply aren’t there. On average, I hold my positions for 66 weeks. I’ll exit when my price target is achieved, and I use stops to manage risks.BH: Yelp is interesting because revenues are growing rapidly, but so too are SG&A expenses. Your 66 week average holding period seems a little long compared to the rest of the gang, but I suppose that will give Yelp time to keep growing its business.Yelp is basically an online platform to help people find highly regarded local businesses. It’s got a huge addressable market, so if it keeps growing revenues, and it finds a way to control costs (eventually it won’t have to spend so heavily on SG&A expenses), Yelp could turn into a highly profitable cash cow.Felix: That’s an interesting story. However, I’m just here to pick winners.BH: That’s why we like you Felix. Do you have an updated rankings list for us?Felix: Yep. Here you go…The trading process can often appear chaotic, especially if you are a newcomer to the field. However, there are methods behind the madness in determining when to enter and exit positions. For example, there are disciplined quantitative processes behind the selections of Felix, RoadRunner and Holmes (as well as Athena and Oscar). Further still, there are disciplined risk controls and exit methodologies in place. And having a disciplined process for entry and exit points is often what separates the most successful traders from the rest of the pack.Each week, Felix and Oscar host a poker game for some of their friends.

4087350,103066,2017-07-12T17:19:00-04:00,"Twitter has floundered as a publicly traded company to provide significant growth in users, revenue and earnings. It's time to reconsider its acquisition strategy.The two-year experiment of part-time CEO has run its course. Twitter’s Dorsey should step aside and allow the company to be steered by a dedicated and proven leader.Dorsey’s last stand could go down as the best birthday present of 2017 – acquire Yelp and name its CEO, and soon-to-be 40 year-old Stoppelman, as the company's CEO.","Twitter's (TWTR) stock is up the past two days after naming Ned Segal as the company’s new CFO. Ned, I hope you read this article.Twitter As Hunter, Rather Than HunteeTwitter has floundered both in its attempts to acquire technologies as well as develop and evolve new in-house platform features. Fatigue has set in on co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey's “turnaround” of Twitter. And investors wonder if there is anything more to the Twitter story than slight platform enhancements, gradual growth of monthly user engagement, and gradual growth of gross revenue. The market wonders if Twitter will ever become profitable.With more than 50 Twitter acquisitions of no-name technologies and companies to enhance the company’s core platform, Twitter has revealed to its investors how it thinks about acquisitions. And this strategy has not contributed to any compelling company metrics other than the occasional small win here and there. If the company only burns $8.5 million a year in free cash – as it did the past 12 months according to USA Today, that’s enough cash to last 412 years. While it seems most analysts see this as a positive attribute to Twitter’s story, I no doubt believe this is of what corporate apathy and atrophy are made.Twitter's strategy as a publicly traded company has been like being on a raft lost at sea, only to be provided glimmers of hope in mirages of home runs and compelling potential growth stories.It purchased Vine only later to shutter it. It changed CEOs back to its co-founder two years ago, who promised radical change. It went all in on Periscope a year ago but hasn’t received the traction or Twitter integrations that investors anticipated. It has now focused on recent changes to how it logs and reports its financials - better categorizing what goes into its cost of sales - a move much welcomed by this Twitter shareholder. With its recent stock strength, now is the time for Twitter to rethink its acquisition strategy. Twitter would benefit itself, and an acquisition target, by shifting from or modify on their focus to buy companies that house desired technology components, by focusing on the acquisition of a profitable synergistic platform with its own unique user base.On the flip side, Twitter has been named as a target itself for much of its publicly traded life. In 2016, rumors hit a peak regarding Twitter as an acquisition target – maybe to Disney (NYSE:DIS), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). As Twitter’s stock spiked, it’s issues of harassment did to – and no suitors came about. With its massive, loyal and international 300 million-plus user base, stumbling blocks for Twitter as an acquisition target remain significant. So rather than dressing Twitter as a huntee, it’s time to flip the coin and allow Twitter to become the hunter. It’s time for Twitter’s leadership to point towards the sky and to set their sights higher. It’s time to go for the “big one."" Yelp (YELP) is Twitter’s home run.Welcome to TWELPThe two business models are based on functional needs for consumers. Consumers have long proven their appetite for both news and headlines, a need satisfied by Twitter, along with an appetite for easily accessible and trusted peer reviews, a need satisfied by Yelp. While Facebook (FB) continues to dominate and excel at fulfilling the functional need for human connection, there is no doubt that it, along with Alphabet, are the two most significant common enemies for Twitter and Yelp. With no significant improvement towards profitability, Twitter has rarely been a favorite stock selection among institutional or retail investors. As the ninth-largest social network, as measured by monthly active users, Twitter has found itself stuck in trying to figure out how to make its core platform profitable and relevant to the investment community.With less than half of the monthly users that make up Twitter’s base, Yelp continues to forge ahead in its niche amongst social media giants, but can’t help but think what happens if Alphabet or Facebook decide to go head-to-head against Yelp’s business model.Potential suitors named by various sources for Yelp are Alphabet, Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Facebook, Microsoft (MSFT), Tripadvisor (TRIP), Alibaba (BABA), Yahoo before it was bought by Verizon (VZ), and Priceline (PCLN). In all the conversation about potential suitors, Twitter has not been mentioned once.Of eight potential suitors (none of which are Twitter), with 27 predictions measured by mergerize.com, the average acquisition price for Yelp is $6.64 billion, or roughly 2.5X Yelp’s current $2.56 billion market cap. However, valuations for tech companies like Yelp have relaxed, creating an attractive window for a Yelp takeover.So as a Twitter shareholder, it’s time to entirely rethink things.To be sure, Twitter can continue to improve on its platform model and how it creates revenue, but the point of this article is not to add to this healthy library of platform evolution suggestions. Rather, I suggest that Twitter’s infrastructure, R&D budget and expense budget be spread across an additional and successful platform, while Twitter finds a new way to monetize its core assets across another company’s robust platform.And in my efforts to find a buyable company, YELP became the obvious target for Twitter. Welcome to TWELP.Five Reasons Why TWELP Makes Sense1. YELP Creates Revenue in a Similar Way to Twitter, but From Different SourcesYelp is making a strategic shift to boosting its higher-margin, lower-dollar commitment, self-serve advertising. Twitter is playing around with a similar model.Some of the best synergies here will be their duplicated efforts to go after the advertisers that are 20 million small business owners in the U.S. Getting it right on one platform likely means getting it right on the other, and as a small business owner I would find significant value in creating a side-by-side advertising campaign using both Yelp and Twitter. Here we find a reduction in the R&D expense line item and the selling expense line item.2. There is Likely a Duplication of Engineering Talent I’m no engineer junkie here, but I’ve hung out with some pretty cool nerds. Both Yelp and Twitter have robust platforms that have been built by high-performing engineering teams, and I’ll leave it up to my more techie friends to discuss and analyze the merits of combining these teams or leaving them as stand alone units.My thesis, however, does not rest on the assumption of cost savings here. However, as a company leader of TWELP Co., I would find it hard to believe a request for 10% improvements to the Development expense line item and the R&D expense line item to be unreasonable.3. Twitter Makes Money. So Does Yelp.Twitter knows how to sell its vast data set to large corporate buyers, and Yelp knows how to sell its tailored data to a variety of different and smaller users. Twitter has data that Yelp data buyers would love to get their hands on, and vice versa.Though growth is decelerating a bit, from 25% sales revenue to 20% sales revenue, Yelp is successfully holding its position as a top player in the local advertiser market. This market includes 20 million businesses in the U.S. with an annual spend rate of around $150 billion in ad spending.Furthermore, Twitter’s primary user base is outside of the U.S., while Yelp’s is domestic. Figure it out kids – go make some money. If the opportunities here seem endless, then this fact from Omnicore Agency should be pretty fun: Twitter claims it can handle 18 quintillion user accounts. Let’s get to work.Other unique Yelp attributes provided by Expanded Ramblings that would benefit Twitter include 2.8 million claimed local businesses, 138,000 local advertisers and 121 million reviews.4. Yelp’s Cofounder and CEO is a Viable Replacement for Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey.Time will tell whether this is one of my more controversial calls, but I believe it’s time for part-time CEO Jack Dorsey to step down.Don’t get me wrong, I’m a big Jack Dorsey fan. And I was very enthusiastic at his reassignment two years ago to the head post at Twitter. I was excited that someone had the audacity to proclaim that he could handle the CEO position at two publicly traded companies, and I was surprised at how well the market received it. I’m a fan.At the time of his reappointment, Dorsey provided exciting rhetoric about turnarounds and energy and vision and direction. And even though Jack asked for some time to provide results, it is becoming apparent that Twitter and its platform has stuck to its ho-hum playbook thus far, and it has continued to buy companies built around proprietary technologies that Twitter wanted to enhance its platform and its revenue creation machine, rather than build it in-house.While both Yelp and Twitter are trying to figure out “what’s next from here,” I believe that one dedicated leader to the vision of both is better than the set-up of each of these parts as they stand today.Yelp’s CEO 39-year-old Jeremy Stoppelman has an impressive resume as co-founder of Yelp and former VP of Engineering at X.com (Paypal). Stoppelman dropped out of Harvard Business School to create Yelp, and he is no stranger to the Twitter platform – often turning to it for a variety or messages, including responding to a former employee’s open letter complaining about the company’s low wages for its San Francisco-based employees.Stoppelman has rejected offers to buy Yelp twice – once from Google for $500 million and then again from Yahoo to buy Yelp for $1 billion. But with the bonus of being named CEO to head up TWELP, Stoppelman would have a hard time turning down this offer.5. Yelp Has Positive EarningsThough only providing slightly positive earnings (the company’s P/E ratio is 411), Yelp is undoubtedly on the right track here, and is another positive sign that the company’s leadership is growing its chops at doing what is necessary to make investors happy.This is good. In robust bull markets it is easy to forget company fundamentals and value companies based on user growth numbers and engagement and other metrics other than earnings and growing them. But when things get choppy in the market, or dicey within the investor base, there is nothing more comforting than positive and growing earnings. My ConclusionA bold move by Twitter’s leadership to acquire Yelp would create room for Twitter to refocus and to jump start growth. Priceline’s acquisition of OpenTable came at a valuation of 13X revenue, according to the Wall Street Journal, and Yelp currently trades at 5X. I project that it will take a bid of $40 - $45/share to compel Stoppelman and Co. to consider this a deal best for Yelp shareholders, and at this price it won’t be hard for Twitter to benefit immediately from this acquisition.With this acquisition, Twitter could shift focus on measuring and executing on significant and immediate growth strategies in monetizing core Twitter and Yelp assets across user bases.Twitter also would have the ability to rest on its strength of its core user base rather than continue to spin its wheels on figuring out how to drive user engagement and growth by evolving its core platform. And in many ways, Yelp suffers from the same stagnation. Each company’s leadership could improve each other’s outlook and place amongst social networks by coming together to unite and evolve.The Pearly Pig Investment Community is a place where we focus on new opportunities, as well as run the Pearly Pig Covered Call portfolio.

4095139,22148,2017-08-04T16:30:00-04:00,Yelp reported incredible quarterly numbers when the market wasn't expecting much.A big deal with GrubHub enhances the cash position and future.Stock remains cheap after the rally.,"Coming off Q1 results that sent Yelp (YELP) plunging, the market probably didn't have big expectations for the last quarter. As my investment thesis highlighted after the last quarterly report, the stock was set to rally due to the overly bearish reaction to numbers that weren't that bad. The stock is up to $40 as the consumer review site not only surprised the market with strong Q2 numbers, but also threw in a positive deal with GrubHub (GRUB) that promises to reward shareholders. As usual, investors now need to process the new data and factor in the higher stock price to derive whether owning the stock is still prudent. The biggest part of the story that investors need to understand is that the market completely overreacted to the Q1 numbers. The stock plunged 30% to $25 after Yelp cut 2017 revenue guidance to $860 million that still amounted to 20% growth. The numbers were not nearly as impressive as originally expected, but the market wasn't giving the consumer review site any credit for actual growth. As pointed out in my previous article via a comparison to Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL), Yelp's stock traded at half the multiple of the larger company despite the same consistent growth over the five-year period. The Q2 results helped reinforce that the sales productivity issue that hurt Q1 numbers were just the normal hiccups in a fast-growing company. For the quarter, Yelp beat analyst revenue estimates, but the big surprise was the earnings leverage in the business. One had really expected that Yelp might need to ramp up sales and marketing expenses to compensate for the disappointing quarter, but instead the company saw margins improve roughly 400 percentage points. Net income jumped to $21.6 million from $12.5 million last Q2 for a 73% gain. Analysts actually expected Yelp to generate a loss for the quarter. The best view of the substantial performance in the quarter was adjusted EBITDA reaching $43 million vs. the company forecast of up to $35 million.Yelp generated $76 million in operating cash flows in the first half of the year brining us to the real news of the day. The company agreed to sell Eat24 to GrubHub for $287.5 million or roughly double the purchase price a few years back. With $530 million of cash, Yelp will approach a cash balance of nearly $800 million when the deal closes. The company implemented a $200 million share buyback as the massive balance sheet and positive cash flow generation provides them with plenty of excess cash. Outside of the cash benefits, the GrubHub deal provides a partnership that enhances the transactions on the Yelp platform. The company will now have access to all of the restaurants on the combined GrubHub/Eat24 platform providing the scale of 75,000 restaurants to lead the market. Yelp will get a transaction fee for each order delivered to GrubHub providing attractive economics and eliminating the need to maintain a separate Eat24 platform and associated costs in a very competitive category where the company didn't have the necessary scale or focus. This brings us back to the question of whether Yelp is attractively priced after the rally. The market cap is only $3.2 billion leaving the enterprise value at around $2.4 billion. Not that expensive for a stock expected to reach revenues approaching $1 billion next year even if the GrubHub deal hits gross revenues as a transaction fee replaces the larger ordering fee. The key investor takeaway is that Yelp isn't even trading at the yearly highs of $43 after the massive rally today. The stock is probably better positioned with the GrubHub partnership that will make the site the best place to review restaurants and order food. Even better, Yelp is a relatively cheap stock so continue holding."
4084590,22148,2017-06-28T13:32:55-04:00,"EU ruled to fine Google for anti-competitive practices on shopping results.Yelp strongly supported the fine and has long claimed damage from the way Google lists search results.Yelp has millions of international users, but pulled back on the business last year.","The news of the week that the EU fined Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL) roughly $2.7 billion for anti-competitive practices in Europe is a potential game breaker for Yelp (YELP). The consumer review site has long complained that Google blocked the service in search results limiting the international business to the point that Yelp pulled plans during Q4.The stock is down around $30 and got no apparent bump from this potential bullish ruling. The question now is whether the EU move provides a catalyst for Yelp.EU RulingThe European Commission fined Google $2.7 billion in a ruling that the search giant abused power by promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of search results. The ruling gives the company 90 days to end the anti-competitive practices or face a 5% fine of average daily worldwide earnings.Alphabet has over $92 billion in cash on the balance sheet and is likely to appeal the ruling, raising questions on whether any changes to the search results will actually occur. A large fine is not the same as enforcement.As Recode reported, Yelp along with Oracle (ORCL) and others signed a letter to the European Commissioner in support of this ruling.Yelp Impact The international business for Yelp was so weak that the company made the decision to restructure during Q4 by cutting 175 employees outside of the U.S. and Canada. For the quarter, the company reported international revenues of only $3.9 million or what would amount to roughly 2% of total revenues.On the flip side, international web unique visitors were 29.4 million, down from 30.8 million to end 2014. The lack of growth was similar to total web users for the company, though Yelp made a huge push into international locations as highlighted in my previous research from over a year ago.Yelp consistently entered international locations in 2014 and 2015, but ended 2016 with only 11.8 million cumulative reviews for those areas. International business wasn't gaining enough traction and the claim at the time was that Google was burying them in search results.The good news for Yelp is that the company found a way around the reliance on search results in the U.S. The mobile app customers interact with the Yelp platform 10x more frequently and the unique devices jumped to 25.8 million users during Q1, up from only 10.9 million users in the first quarter of 2014.The opportunity still exists in international locations whether or not Yelp is trying to monetize the business at this point. A simple search for tacos in London came back with results such as Wahaca that has nearly 250 reviews including one recently posted on 6/15.The good news is that Yelp ended 2016 with about 30 million international users. The biggest problem is that Yelp had operations in 30 countries. The average country outside of the U.S. and Canada only has one million users leaving the consumer review site without the scale to attract advertisers to a big extent.The big question on the Q2 earnings call could well be whether this EU ruling will help the company move back into an opportunity that likely matches the current $800 million revenue run rate of domestic business. The Q1 earnings call had no mention of the opportunity outside of the U.S. providing the stock with a potential major catalyst to finally grow and monetize its existing large base of users.Takeaway The key investor takeaway is that Yelp remains a cheap stock trading with an enterprise value of roughly $1.9 billion and revenues forecast to top $1.0 billion in 2018. The stock is ridiculously cheap based on the current domestic business alone while the international business provides a major catalyst not even factored into the value currently.Don't buy Yelp due to this ruling because Google might figure out a way to never change the search results. Buy the stock because a leader in local advertising trades for an EV/Sales of 2x with a potential major catalyst for free."

Those numbers are not typing errors, they are accurate.In today's market there are some companies that remind of the irrationally exuberant days of the late '90s prior to the dot.com bust. Yelp may be one of those companies.After Yelp turned in a surprisingly positive quarter with good news on several fronts investors became very exuberant. Possibly, investors may have become a little irrational.Markets for individual stocks often trade too high or too low on emotion. Generally, when the emotion subsides prices return to more rational levels.Even after the round of analyst upgrades through this writing on Sunday night 8/6/17 the consensus estimate is at a 12-month price target of only $37.14.

Installing that T-1 line in the late '90s was expensive since my building had no Internet access back then. But it was worth it. While buying/selling stocks at fast speeds during the day on a state-of-the-art trading platform was very cool in those days, in the evenings I was equally happy downloading several songs at a time for free off of Napster in just several seconds time. For those of you who remember, you know these were fun times. The markets were crazy good and the money just seemed to come very easily.For example, while watching CNBC on that birthday it was announced that Internet service provider Juneau Communications would offer free Internet in order to gain market share. Today we might pause to consider the feasibility of this business model. But not in 1999. Having a lightning fast platform and connectivity I was the proud owner of 3,000 shares of Juneau in a matter of seconds. As the market's close approached I was up $39,000 on the day. The dot.com boom days were like that. In 1996 Fed Chairman Greenspan characterized the markets with the term ""irrational exuberance."" But the story gets better, unfortunately not for me though since I sold my shares at the close. Again, it was my birthday and I was going out that night and it just seemed like the prudent thing to take profits. The next morning Juneau spiked 41 points higher. I made $39,000 the day before and I left $123,000 on the table by missing the next day's spike. That was typical trading action during the tail end of the dot.com boom. If you don't believe me, ask somebody.I was reminded of Juneau and the dot.com era this past Friday 8/4/17 while watching CNBC. I know, deja vu, right? But see for yourself: While you watch Josh Brown discuss Yelp (YELP) in this CNBC clip, please note his discussion of the company's decision to minimize profitability which results in a valuation metric of a 200 forward PE. Josh explains this is because of the necessity to gain market share that he calls Yelp's efforts to make, ""a land grab."" Then recall that in my anecdotal story from 1999, Juneau was foregoing profitability to gain market share also. In fact, Juneau was giving away free Internet and this may explain why Juneau disappeared shortly thereafter during the dot.com bust. That 1999 birthday was less than three months prior to the dot.com market's peak on March 10, 2000.The point is that some of today's companies and their stock valuations are reminiscent of the dot.com era. Yelp is one of those companies. Yahoo Finance shows a trailing twelve month PE of 541 and a forward PE of 200. Josh Brown attempts to explain away Yelp's irrationally exuberant PE metrics but the argument sounds a bit specious. Yelp's 27% one day gain on Friday after posting a very good earnings surprise may be too much gain too soon for this stock.Apparently, a number of analysts agree that Yelp has gotten ahead of itself on Friday's trading. MarkeBeat shows that after this recent round of upgrades the consensus price target for the next 12 months is only 37.14. Since then tonight on Sunday evening Royal Bank Of Canada raised their price target on Yelp to just $36, which is a full 4 points below Friday's close. However, it should be noted that a lesser firm named MKM Partners upgraded Yelp to a buy with a price target of $48.Based upon valuation and analyst price targets, it appears that Yelp is fully valued while trading at $40 and due for a pullback. Keep in mind that the $37.14 consensus price target is a 12-month target meaning that the stock is not expected to trade above this price during this time frame. Of course, price targets often change but for right now the consensus is signaling that Yelp is overbought in the near term. And this opportunity is what presents us with our trading recommendations to sell shares of Yelp short for the trade.Yelp is often referred to as the Yellow Pages of the Internet with a focus on food and restaurant reviews. Competitors in the space include Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) which represents a threat to Yelp in an increasingly saturated North American market for social media, advertising, search, and food reviews.The catalyst for the price spike in Yelp's stock on Friday was the surprisingly strong quarter turned in with several positive news items included in the second quarter 2017 report.It should be noted that while the $200 million stock buyback sounds impressive it would only equate to about 5 million shares at the current price of $40 per share. And this buyback program has no time limit, may be modified or canceled and will only take place when the company feels like any share purchase is warranted by the balance sheet. So the stock buyback is likely to be spread out over quite a few quarters into the future. And the new partnership with GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) is untested and may not generate significant revenue in the near term, or ever. The one time sale of the Eat24 asset is just that, a one-time event. So while these events all are excellent fodder for building hype, the market is likely to realize that these items may be less significant to the price of the stock than originally thought.This would bring the market's focus back to what matters the most: Yelp's financial performance year-to-date, this second quarter, and 2H17. The stock chart for Yelp illustrates the inconsistency of the company's quarterly performances over the last year. Inconsistency is actually the norm for this stock, which puts the Q3 report in question. It appears that investors are now pricing in a successful Q3 into this stock on the day of Q2 earnings. Again, investors seem to be way ahead of themselves on the run higher in the price of Yelp shares. There is absolutely no guarantee for Q317 numbers and the stock appears due for a pullback after possibly becoming overbought on Friday.Summary and Conclusion:Yelp has become very inconsistent in its quarterly financial reports, which has created several price gaps on their stock chart. The success of Q2's financial report could very well have caused Yelp's stock to trade above $40 on the high expectations of investors for the future. While it remains to be seen if Yelp can produce more successful quarters in Q317 and beyond, currently shares of Yelp may be overbought and due for a pullback. Trader's Idea Flow is recommending a short sale of Yelp for a trade.As an informal survey, Trader's Idea Flow would like to ask readers: When was the last time that you typed Yelp.com into your address bar?

4081633,102413,2017-06-15T09:02:25-04:00,Yelp underwent a significant repricing after it announced its last quarterly results. Could we have predicted this?We look at the turnaround story to see if it is all rosy.We review the valuation dilemma and question some of the reasoning behind the bull analysis.,"I started looking at Yelp (NYSE:YELP) recently when it showed up under our top performers list for our Relative Value Model. After being pretty much spot on our Fair Value, our model started taking a discount towards the end of April. When Yelp reported earnings, the stock dropped pretty much exactly to our Fair Value at that time before slowly recovering a bit as of today. Now our model did not have any information about whether they would cut guidance, however it was able to determine that the market was taking a discount on stocks with similar fundamentals. When they did cut the guidance, a lot of the hot air came out of the stock and it found some support around our new Fair Value. Our Fair Value though has continued to decrease during this time and is currently at about a 28% discount to the last closing price. This got me interested in Yelp. Anytime I am looking to form a thesis about a stock, I first try to review the reasoning behind the opposing view. In doing so for Yelp, I find a notable flaw in a lot of the bull theses.FundamentalSpeculation.IO Yelp Relative Value ModelLets first take a quick look at the history of the company. Yelp was founded in 2004 as a way to croudsource reviews about local businesses and became a public company in March of 2012. They decided to provide access to the croudsourced reviews for free which meant their business model relied on advertising from the local businesses attempting to target the customers for revenue. While this puts them in direct competition with some very big players such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Yelp is still considered the leader in this space. The challenge with Yelp is that just like a bunch of other companies that went public around the same time, while it has shown good revenue growth, it has little to show in terms of profits. The company over the years has almost mimicked the performance of another company I have followed more closely, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). Both companies were very popular with investors initially and after failing to deliver on the expectations have been trying to turnaround their fortunes. In the case of Groupon, there are also a bunch of red flags in their business financials which I have covered in several articles previously. I haven't reviewed Yelp's financials in similar detail and will take their results at face value for the purposes of this article.The turnaround storyOne of the biggest challenges for Yelp was that a lot of the traffic to their website used to come from Google Search results. Remember they do not have a subscription model so the only way for them to generate revenue is to attract users to their service so they can show ads from local businesses along with the target result. Now Google has been accused of prioritizing its own results over third-party and this was a major cause for concern. Over the years Yelp has been trying to get its users to interact directly with its service through its app and it looks like this effort is paying off. This gives them more direct control over their customer base. As of the most recent quarter, Yelp claims 68% of searches on its service were done on a mobile device.SourceThey also maintain a healthy cash balance which gives them some flexibility in finding new ways to monetize the existing customer base or acquire new customers. They have been trying to do this in recent years via their online reservation service (Yelp Reservations) and food delivery service (Eat 24). These currently account for a fraction of the total revenue as shown below. Still, it a positive in terms of diversifying from the advertising revenue stream and they do have the cash on hand to try to execute on it.Source: Yelp 10QThe valuation dilemmaSo what is the problem here? The challenge is that you have a company that hasn't demonstrated any meaningful ability to generate profits so far over multiple years. The bullish thesis always points to the revenue growth but this hasn't come cheap. Yelp spent a whopping 55% of its revenue in the last quarter on sales and marketing. It has been even higher in the past. There is good reason for it. We are in a market that is paying up for growth, so why not give the investors what they want! The problem is though that it loses its significance when companies go for growth at all costs.Source: Yelp 10QFundamentalSpeculation.IO Yelp Cluster RatiosThis has led to what looks like a dilemma on how to value the company. Any attempt to do a fundamental analysis based on first principles is futile - who knows what the prospects of the company will look like a few years down the line when people are struggling to predict the results for the next quarter. People resort to Market based valuation models pointing to other companies to justify Yelp's valuation. You will also be able to find a few articles on Seeking Alpha attempting to apply a similar relative value model. Also since there are no profits to speak of, the only option is to use some form of a revenue multiple some other such metric that is more meaningful for comparison. People frequently compare these multiples to Alphabet or Facebook since they offer somewhat similar functionality as part of their service. But why in the world would be compare Yelp to Alphabet or Facebook when their business fundamentals are not even in the same ballpark! Yes, Alphabet and Facebook command much higher revenue multiples but it is because they are also massively more profitable than Yelp. Our relative value model is basing its results on a group of companies with business fundamentals similar to Yelp and I believe this gives a better indication of what could be considered fair value for Yelp in today's market.All that being said, if you are a technical trader, our Momentum model currently indicates a bullish bias in the name. So if you like technical trading, maybe it is a good time to get into the stock. Nevertheless, I do not believe the stock has the fundamentals to support the current price and while it can run up in between financial reports, the fundamentals will bring it down every time."
4078474,102689,2017-06-03T10:31:55-04:00,"Growth has decelerated faster than expected, but still lots of growth ahead.Net cash and equivalents now represent over 20% of Yelp's market cap, a larger percentage than Alphabet, Apple, Facebook or Microsoft (and it doesn't have to be repatriated).The moat may be stronger than we think. Success in connecting people with local businesses when they are most interested in spending money has proven difficult for others to recreate.Divergence between my discounted cash flow and sales-to-market multiple valuations suggests that the company is likely worth much more to other companies than on its own, growing organically.","Earlier this month, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) reported roughly in line quarterly results but was hit by a swift 18% sell-off as 2017 sales growth guidance was lowered to just 20% YoY due to an unexpected drop in customer retention. This guidance was clearly disappointing and certainly affects the valuation. Furthermore, it introduces more uncertainty in forecasting Yelp's growth trajectory over the coming years.Despite this, the current valuation still appears very attractive, particularly after the sell-off. The growth opportunities are still intact.What Happened?According to management, an unexpected down tick in customer retention (to 78% from 80%) in Q1 has lowered the base book of business, resulting in the downward guidance of 2017 revenue to $850M-$865M from $880M-$900M. The explanation given is that a particular cohort of customers acquired in Q1 2016 when the company moved from a CPM (cost per impression) to a primarily CPC (cost per click) pricing model did not see the ROI they expected, causing above trend turnover within this cohort. Management believes this is partly due to the sales force learning curve in selling the new cost model, as well as the newly acquired businesses having issues successfully competing with more established businesses on Yelp.Since being identified mid-quarter, and with ""all hands on deck"", management communicated they believe the course has been corrected and the one-time event is in the past. The revised 2017 guidance apparently has some retention improvement built in. For investors, it is impossible to know for sure if this is true or not, which increases uncertainty in the possible growth trajectories in the years ahead. The market will likely keep Yelp in the penalty box until the results speak for themselves.Reasons to believeWhile the revised guidance of 20% growth, down from previous guidance of 25% growth (and down from 30% growth in 2016) is clearly disappointing, the company is still growing sales at a 20% clip. The $146B local ad spend market opportunity is still there. And, with no debt, Yelp's cash on hand continues to grow, despite spending 20% of sales on R&D and acquiring two businesses in Q1 (NoWait and Turnstyle). After the recent sell-off, the $6 of net cash per share on the balance sheet now represents over 20% of the market cap, a valuable fact that often gets overlooked.There are several reasons to believe sales will continue to grow at double-digit rates:Reasons for concernWhile there are many reasons to be bullish on Yelp's growth, there are several reasons for caution, which are currently holding the stock price down.ValuationYelp is still in the high growth phase and thus far as been forgoing profitability to continue fueling that growth. For now, it is still a breakeven company. This makes the traditional discounted cash flow valuation more difficult and widens the price range between my optimistic and pessimistic scenarios given a reasonable confidence interval.The recent guidance revision certainly caused me to reevaluate and adjust my growth assumptions, which resulted in a significantly lower discounted cash flow valuation. My revised scenario weighted fair value for Yelp on an organic, standalone basis is $34 per share, but ranges from $19 to $45 under varying scenarios. Still, this is a 20% premium to where shares have traded in recent days.On a price-to-sales or price-to-EV multiple basis, the stock looks much more attractive. In even the most pessimistic of scenarios, I find it hard to believe that Yelp is not worth 3 times sales. Under assumptions of 19% sales growth in 2017, followed by 16% sales growth in 2018, and a 3 times sales multiple, the company would be worth $30 per share in today's dollars. A more reasonable price-to-sales multiple of 4 would put the stock value today at over $40 per share.Yelp also has a terrific balance sheet. With nearly $500M in cash or equivalents and no debt, over 20% of Yelp's market cap is the value of its cash. I think it would surprise most to know that this is a higher net cash position as percent of market cap than Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet, Facebook or Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).Since the price-to-sales multiple valuation doesn't take into consideration all of this cash, price-to-EV is likely the better metric for making comparisons to other online advertising companies.YELP EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsTakeover ValueThe divergence between my estimate of Yelp's value growing organically on its own versus a more typical price-to-sales or price-to-EV multiple is driven by the fact that a lot of value could be unlocked if Yelp was taken over by one of the big three (or perhaps others). The following are a few examples of how one of the big three could bring out value from Yelp more quickly than Yelp can on its own.Takeover catalysts:Outside of valuation, I see several potential catalysts that could increase the likelihood of a Yelp takeover. First, in September of last year, the company converted all of its class B shares, which had 10 votes per share, into class A shares. As a result, all shares now have one vote and company control is no longer concentrated amongst a handful of insiders. In addition to making an acquisition easier, it also increases the chances that an activist investor or private equity firm could get involved and ultimately push for a sale.Second, should U.S. companies be granted a cash repatriation tax holiday, large tech firms will be pressured to either return a portion of those funds to shareholders, or put it to work with strategic acquisitions. Large cap tech companies will be the largest beneficiaries, with hundreds of billions of dollars overseas combined. Yelp would be considered a small acquisition with a market cap of just $2.3B.Conclusion:After the recent sell-off following the Q1 2017 earnings call, Yelp sells at steep discounts to peers on a price-to-sales and price-to-enterprise basis. While the overall growth story is still intact, the trajectory has become more uncertain and significant risks remain. That said, the moat around the restaurant vertical is strengthening and that will ultimately keep users engaged with Yelp on a regular basis. The standalone value of Yelp is more modest but still offers upside at current levels. The takeover value is intriguing and could be viewed by investors as a free option embedded in this valuation."
4078133,103266,2017-06-01T14:10:22-04:00,"Yelp is a glorified call center business through an army of underpaid 20-year-olds (salespeople are at an unsustainable 59% of total headcount).Despite what management asserted on the 1Q 17 earnings call, low retention rates are likely the new normal due to increased self-serve customers with higher churn.Large competitors including FB (Instagram location), Amazon (home service), Google (maps, voice, local search), and VC-backed food startups have better business models and positioning.Recently disclosed transaction revenue is growing at less than double digits quarter over quarter at a measly $18M a quarter.","Having been a Yelp (NYSE:YELP) user since 2008, I have seen the rise, maturity, and signs of decline of Yelp in terms of popularity and penetration. Yelp's business model is flawed in a serious way. There is increasing competition from the traditional local search players, local food discovery and delivery startups, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). In this article, I will point out some red flags on Yelp's business model and long-term trends/metrics to watch.1. Glorified Call Center BusinessYelp has an army of early 20-something, straight-out-of college, bros who like kegs and EDM music. They happen to work at Yelp, for the moment, until they leave after 6 months and are replaced by new graduates. Let's hear these Yelp employees speak for themselves (Glassdoor reviews from 2017):Yelp has an appalling low revenue per headcount, lower than that of Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), which is known in the industry to have a high emphasis on sales and high churn. It will be difficult for this business model to be sustainable without a radical change. On an average annualized basis, Yelp employee produces $180K on average of top line revenue. It's not a great number considering that all-in employee compensation and benefits at tech companies are close to $200K.Management says that product is a huge focus at the company, but 59% of the total headcount are in sales. Groupon at the peak had more than half its headcount in salespeople. Taking into account operational departments including HR, accounting, legal, and finance, the percentage of technical engineers at the company is likely less than 10%. Yelp cannot be considered a tech company, and supports the thesis that the business based on the success of a call center.Yelp received multiple complaints on Glassdoor on low pay for sales positions. At trough unemployment, recent college graduates have many employment options available, especially in the enterprise tech sales. As the Abused Ex-Employee pointed out, they will not stick with Yelp if the company will not raise salaries in line with the local labor market. Thus, it is not a sustainable business model for Yelp to squeeze out profits by underpaying their salespeople over the long term.2. Low retention rates will continue to plague local revenueDuring the 1Q 2017 earnings call, all eyes were on the low retention number in the local advertisers category. Almost every single analyst asked clarifying questions, for which management had a weak answer regarding low retention: They were 'course correcting quickly' and losses were limited to a small subset of local advertisers. In one of the questions, management did admit to the reason behind poor numbers: older established advertisers crowding out new advertisers (an important fact that will shed light on the timing of when lower retention rates will hit). This is an alarming problem.On search (most common use case for repeating users), the Yelp algorithm will prioritize restaurants advertising with Yelp that have both high stars and a large number of reviews. Because of the way the search results are ranked by number and laid out - the advertisers established on Yelp will always take the top 5 spots. So why would any new businesses advertise with Yelp? Yelp has basically maxed out the number of ad placements they can sell with the top 5 spots.In addition to maxing out on the number of advertisers, the ""unsearchability"" of new restaurants also drives away the niche power users - the trendy foodies that are seeking new restaurants (see #3 on users moving to Instagram).Management asserted that the self-serve platform comprises a double-digit percentage of their local advertisers. They did not specify whether this number was on new advertisers or all advertisers. This will help them in lowering operating expenses, but will take a while before any benefit is seen. On the negative side, it sounds like these self-serve advertisers are the same ones that are being crowded out by the established advertisers.As long as the self-serve number keeps growing, Yelp will see lower retention numbers for a cycle out. If we heed to the wisdom of The Extinct Account Manager, like advertisers need constant attention and calling prevent cancellations. This does not sound like a light-touch business model, or even a service businesses would want.3. Instagram, Google, Amazon, and food startups have superior products in food discovery, local search, home services, and food orderingThe majority of Yelp content is generated by a handful of users. According to a Yelp blog post from 2011, only 1% of users create content (write reviews). A Quora user in 2013 did a case study of Yelp on San Francisco (which tends to be more tech savvy and engaged in digital products) revealing that the top 1% of reviewers contributed 25% of reviews and the top 5% of reviewers contributed 50% of reviews. Yelp rewards the top contributors in a program called, ""Yelp Elite.""Yelp Elites are predominately women, disproportionately Asian, group of snobby individuals that call themselves foodies and take photos of everything they eat. They aren't necessarily qualified to write restaurant reviews but they will give a restaurant a 1-Star review because the waiter didn't say bye. The reviews are hardly about the restaurant, but rather a humble brag of how amazing their life is for having gone to a Michelin Star restaurant.There are a few problems with relying on this small subset (dare I say subculture? I call them Basic B****) of individuals for content: 1. They aren't necessarily qualified or a trusted source to judge quality or convey it. 2. People still look to trusted sources (NY Times, LA Times, Eater, Thrillst, even Anthony Bourdain) for food discovery. 3. This small subset of UGC (user generated content) producers is now flocking to Instagram to show off their food photos, where their friends can see the humble bragging. Instagram #foodie search yields 60 million photos and #cronut yields 190K photos, and Dominique Ansel Bakery location search on Instagram has endless stream of content vs. Yelp (6K photos and 2K reviews). Additionally, Instagram is also making a push on the product side in local search through Story Search for Locations.Amazon is making a big push to upsell local service (for a flat and predetermined fee) after selling a product that requires service. For example, I recently scheduled Amazon home service for TV mount installation after buying a TV mount they delivered the next day. I attempted to ask for quotes on Yelp, but it turned into a back-and-forth conversation on price negotiation, information exchange regarding TV and mount specs, and hours of wasted time for me and the contractor.Google - which owns search - is only investing more into local search through web search, on Android, on voice products (Home and phone), and on maps. Google Maps launched a search function which helps you look for destinations along your route, which is powerful as these searches have high intent.On the food ordering side, EAT24 is competing with a handful of well-funded startups (and public companies) that don't mind the high customer acquisition costs to get a new user, including GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) ($10 off $15 order), Caviar ($10 off first two orders), Uber (NYSE:UBER) ($10 off, plus an established driver network and user base), and Postmates ($20 off delivery).4. Transactions volume has low growth and doesn't make sense for Yelp to enterManagement decided to break out transaction revenue, separate from ad revenue. A good reason to do this is because transaction shows an area of promising growth in their already maxed out and broken ad business.At a pitiful $18M in quarterly revenue (small base), the growth rate is not even double-digit growth quarter over quarter. As for business model for transaction, it does not make sense to order or to book on Yelp. If you look at OpenTable reviews, most restaurants are rated 4-5 stars. OpenTable will delete bad reviews and it is less of a platform for customers to complain about their edge cases. It does not make sense for a restaurant to offer booking on Yelp unless their rating is high - which is only a small subset of restaurants. If all restaurants are highly rated, then Yelp loses its authenticity value.The messaging functionality is not an efficient way to book a service. Management said it took on average of 4 replies multiplied by a 12-hour message return time; it will take a few days before a soft transaction has finished negotiation. The customer then still needs to take the next step in actually going to the establishment or booking the service. Most of the Yelp messages do not consummate into an actual transaction and anecdotally small business owners have said replying to messages is a waste of time.Takeaways:"
4071890,22148,2017-05-10T16:59:52-04:00,Yelp disappointed the market with weak revenue guidance.The market continues to miss the absolute revenue growth that was maintained in guidance.The valuation metrics remain extremely attractive on the dip.,"After reporting disappointing Q1 numbers last night, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) initially traded down nearly 30% to $25. The market continues to miss the underlying growth story with the consumer review site.In mid-day trading, the stock already is up to $28.50 as a few analysts came out bullish on Yelp following the large selloff. Is now the time to own the stock?The Q1 numbers were generally positive with decent trends in leverage and user numbers. The issue was with the big cuts in the revenue guidance for the rest of the year.While revenue cuts are never good, investors need to keep the numbers in perspective. Yelp cut 2017 revenues to $850 to $865 million from a previous guidance of $880 to $900 million. The company had revenues of $713 million in 2016.The cut amounts to $32.5 million at the midpoint of previous guidance or roughly 3.6%. Naturally, one must wonder how a nearly 4% reduction in revenues originally caused a 30% dip in the stock, so the reaction was clearly overdone.The key is to keep a focus on absolute versus relative performance. Yelp didn't meet internal goals, but the new numbers amount to 20% revenue growth for the year.My investment thesis with sticking with Yelp has constantly came back to the absolute growth story. Over the last five years, the consumer review site keeps producing the revenue growth as the market frets over the growth rate.YELP data by YChartsAdding the additional $39 million from Q1 over last year brings the TTM revenue total to $752 million. For this reason, the chart with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was included showing how a stock with constantly growing revenues typically moves right along with the revenue growth.The prime reason that the Yelp price isn't following the revenue growth and the reason the stock selloff isn't justified is the valuation multiple. Yelp now trades at half the EV/revenues multiple of Alphabet.YELP EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsWhile Yelp had a clear issue in the quarter with sales execution, key user growth remained strong. Cumulative reviews grew by 26% YoY to 127 million and App Unique Devices jumped 22% over last Q1. Maybe most importantly is that growth accelerated from roughly 1.2 million sequential adds last Q1 to 1.8 million sequential last quarter to a new record 25.8 million unique devices.The key investor takeaway is that the market continues to lack confidence in Yelp despite the history of growing in the face of stiff competition. With all of the user metrics remaining strong, the dip is a buying opportunity as advertisers will ultimately follow users."

Herewith are two lessons from Yelp's drop.Two Lessons From Yelp's Drop1. Stop Orders Don't Protect You When A Stock Gaps DownAs with the Twilio (NYSE:TWLO) miss last week, the 5-day chart of Yelp below offers another dramatic example of a gap down after a bad quarter.If you had a stop order or a limit sell order to sell your YELP shares at, say, $31, you wouldn't have gotten out at $31 on Wednesday, because the stock never traded at that price on Wednesday. You would have been down ~18.5%.2. Hedging Still Limits Your Risk When Stocks Gap DownHere's an example with an optimal collar hedge on YELP as of Tuesday's close.The May 9th Optimal Collar Hedge:As of May 9th's close, this was the optimal collar to hedge 1,000 shares of YELP against a greater than 15% drop by mid-November while not capping an investor's upside at less than 14% by the end of that time period (screen captures via the Portfolio Armor iOS app).As you can see at the bottom of the second screen capture above, the net cost of this hedge was $0 (calculated conservatively, using the ask price of the puts and the bid price of the calls). This was the highest-cap hedge available with zero cost over that time frame on Tuesday.The point of this hedge was that the investor could tolerate a decline of 15%, but no more than that. Let's see where you'd be had you hedged then and held since.How The May 9th Collar Responded To YELP's DropHere's an updated quote on the put leg as of Wednesday's close:And here is an updated quote on the call leg:How That Hedge Ameliorated YELP's SlideYELP closed at $34.70 on Tuesday, May 9th. A shareholder who owned 1,000 shares of it and hedged with the collar above then had $34,700 in YELP shares plus $2,800 in puts, and if he wanted to buy-to-close his short call leg, he would have needed to pay $2,800 to do that. So, his net position value on May 9th was ($34,700 + $2,800) - $2,800 = $34,700.YELP closed at $28.27 on Wednesday, May 10th, down about 18.5% from its closing price on May 9th. The investor's shares were worth $28,270 as of 5/10, his put options were worth $5,250, and if he wanted to close out the short call leg of his collar, it would have cost him $675, using the midpoint of the spread in both cases. So ($28,270 + $5,250) - $675 = $32,845. $32,845 represents a 5.3% drop from $34,700.More Protection Than PromisedSo, although YELP had dropped by about 18.5% at the time of the calculations above, and the hedge was designed to limit an investor to a loss of no more than 15%, he would actually have been down 5.3% on his combined net hedge plus underlying stock position by this point. This is another example of the impact of time value on a hedge designed to protect based on its intrinsic value alone."
4060817,102646,2017-04-06T14:06:47-04:00,Concerns about reviews from the likes of Facebook and Google are overblown.Yelp has exited its unprofitable areas giving the management room to grow its profitable areas in the U.S and Canada.Yelp is implementing a strategy to monetize its platform through transactions.,"Yelp (YELP) went public five years ago, pricing its stock at $15 per share. In the IPO, the company raised $96 million giving it a valuation of $900 million. Today, Yelp’s stock price is trading at $33 and its valuation has soared to $2.3 billion. At its peak, the company’s stock traded at $98, giving it a valuation of almost $7 billion. In this article, I will explain the reasons I believe Yelp is a good investment at the current price.A lot has happened since the company went public. First, the number of people who read online reviews has gone up significantly. In a 2015 report, Mintel found out that 70% of all American adults did some online research before shopping. This number went up to 82% in 2016, as stated in a research report by Pew Research. Second, the number of companies offering online reviews has gone up as well.Companies like Google (GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (FB), Amazon (AMZN), and TripAdvisor (TRIP) have tools to help people leave reviews for products and services that they buy. Earlier this year, Google improved its Maps product to help people leave and share reviews. Third, review companies have improved how they weed out fake reviews and the people’s trust in online reviews is increasing. Finally, more people are now using mobile to find and leave reviews.In the past five years, Yelp has managed to grow its annual revenue from $137 million to $713 million. The total number of reviews in Yelp have increased from 31 million in 2012 to 121 million in December 2016. Today, more than 3.4 million businesses have claimed businesses in Yelp. In 2012, this number was just 40,000. The number of active advertisers has grown to 138,000 and the impact is showing.A report by Harvard Business School (and Yelp), found that businesses which advertised in Yelp increased their Yelp page views by 25%. Getting directions, browsing the company’s website, and calling the restaurant increased by 18%, 9%, and 13% respectively. Profits have however been elusive. In 2014, the company made a profit of $36 million before going back to its loss-making ways.Source: YelpInvestors bearish on the company are focused on its future growth prospects. They fear that companies like Google and Facebook, which have billions of daily impressions, will take business from Yelp. Although the number of reviews in Facebook and Google is not yet known, a quick look at some businesses show that Yelp has more reviews. For instance, Seven Hills, a restaurant in San Francisco has 746 Yelp reviews compared to 146 in Facebook. The same is true for Restaurant Gary Danko, which has 4,457 Yelp reviews and 1,161 Facebook reviews. The same trend is true for most businesses I've looked at.Another reason for concern is Yelp’s growth prospects now that it has exited most of its international operations. These concerns are unwarranted. While Yelp spent a lot of money acquiring companies abroad, the results were not encouraging. In the most recent quarter, the exited markets contributed just 1% to the company’s revenue. The exited markets would do little to contribute to Yelp’s new strategy that aims to increase engagement and transactions. This is not new. Groupon (GRPN) and Angie’s List (ANGI), which focus on the local market, have scaled down their international expansion strategies.As shown below, advertising is the core business for Yelp. However, the management understands the challenges and complexities in online advertising with programmatic advertising dominating the market.Source: Seeking AlphaTransactions will now be the focus area for Yelp. Through Yelp Eat24, the company is targeting one of its largest consumer base. As shown below, the restaurant category is the most actively reviewed in Yelp. Although the food delivery industry is saturated, I believe that it makes sense to have the service in Yelp. Today, this service contributes most of the company’s transaction revenues. Also, to cater for its restaurant customers, Yelp acquired Nowait, a company that facilitates restaurant bookings. In the long term, these initiatives will contribute significantly to the company’s growth.Source: Seeking AlphaYelp is also trying other ways of increasing transactions by eliminating the ""message this business"" tool. Using the request-a-quote tool, users can now request quotations from the companies they’ve just reviewed. Depending on how fast and friendly the company responds, the customer can easily figure out whether the reviews they read were accurate or not. If the customer agrees to the terms of the company, they can continue to check out using the Yelp Platform. 2016 was the first full year of implementing the request-a-quote tool and the company processed 4.5 million requests.By incorporating transactions, Yelp is positioning itself to be a leading e-commerce platform for local businesses. This was clear in the recent earnings call when Jed Nachman (Yelp’s COO) said that the new tools they are adding are geared towards powering local businesses. This will be a massive opportunity going by the number of people who use Yelp regularly. The numbers across its apps, mobile websites, and desktop are shown below.Source: YelpIn conclusion, Yelp is a company in transition. It has exited unprofitable markets to focus on growth in the United States and Canada. This move enables the management to remain laser-focused on diversifying the company’s revenue in its most profitable areas. Its future success depends on how it grows traction to attract more people and how it implements the transaction-based model."

Choose a method that fits your own trading personality.,"For the last three weeks, the term “overbought” has been frequently used to describe the overall market as well as many specific stocks. What does this really mean?It has a dangerous sound, and that is indeed the common message. A stock, or a sector, or the overall market has rallied more than expected over an extended time. What does that mean for traders? Or for investors?It is an excellent question for our experts.ReviewOur last Stock Exchange focused on trading sector rotations, Oscar’s regular mission. There was an excellent discussion. It provides special value when readers engage with our crew of ""technical analysts.""To encourage this discussion and diversity, we will have some visiting experts for the next two weeks:Today’s ThemeAn extended stock move is often described as overbought or oversold. For most observers, an overbought stock or market is poised for a selloff. Some technical analysts measure this in terms of relative strength measures (RSI).How important is this warning sign?Pension Partners warns of an “optical illusion,” citing multiple prior examples and then considering the current NASDAQ 100. Look at the interesting evidence in the entire article leading to this conclusion:If one is going to predict anything based on extreme overbought levels (and I would advise against doing so), it would be further gains. I realize that doesn’t conform to the prevailing narrative of “overbought is always bearish,” but the truth in markets rarely does.Chris Ciovacco has a nice chart pack of prior overbought conditions. The mixed results are a warning to anyone thinking about trading on this approach – despite the recent somber warnings from the NYSE floor via Art Cashin.What do our Stock Exchange experts think about overbought markets? We will hear them out and, as usual, I will conclude with a brief observation about the key points. I will begin with Athena, who specializes in short-term momentum trades.This Week — Trading an Overbought MarketAthenaMy approach is to find winners and ride the gains. Fundamental analysts are skeptical of momentum, but trend-following is one of the strongest historical methods. The “trend is your friend” is not just a cliché. Principal Financial Group (PFG) is a great example; it has been on tear for a month. That is enough to put it on my radar. The sharp increases may be off-putting to some, but they are mistaken. The trend line is strong. I’m looking for an increase of 2-3% over the next 2-4 weeks.J: Are you concerned that the stock might be overbought?A: In my evaluation methods, the price action is a sign of strength.J: At what point would a major gain worry you?A: I like stocks that are showing strength, but I am ruthless when it comes time to get out.J: So, you do not worry about overbought conditions on the entry?A: Some of the best trades come when an “overbought” stock gets more overbought.J: For a welcome change, your choice is also attractive on a value basis.A: Value? What does that mean?J: You can see it in the fine chart from F.A.S.T graphs. Let us turn to Felix, who also follows a momentum strategy.FelixI will once again begin with my responses to reader votes for the favorites list.My list provides rankings within each zone, as well as the basics about buy, hold, and sell. The list includes the most recent reader questions as well as former requests where my rating has moved.J: AMD is still on top?F: It leads the reader list, but not my own.J: I have had some questions about that. Readers want to know your own top picks.F: If I talked about that here, I would be revealing what I recommend for your clients.J: That is a problem. I want to be helpful to readers, but emphasizing that it should be a start for their own research. We did have a couple of questions last week. What do you think about reader Jim Irving’s questions about CRX and CXRX, which he identifies as debt-laden drug companies?F: He is right to be concerned. CRX is on my sell list and CXRX is a very weak hold. I wish that more readers would submit such questions. I need my incentive bonus to kick in.J: Do you have anything fresh for us this week?F: Nothing new, since my focus is longer than the others. Let me take up a holding that some are worried about, NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA). This was one of my long-term picks in early December of 2016. We’ve had two major spikes in price since then, followed by a decline in February. Those with a short-term mindset are worried. Since I’m interested in holding out for the long haul, I haven’t been preoccupied by the dips. I’m up about 10% here after nearly a full quarter in the position – nothing to sneeze at!J: Would you call this an “overbought” stock?F: Not on my time frame. The definition of overbought should adjust to your investment purpose. OscarWe haven’t hit March Madness yet, so I am mostly thinking spring training. For many teams the question is whether to play big ball or small ball. In small ball baseball, players trade the long odds on huge plays in favor of more manageable base hits. Sometimes the small ball approach generates more runs and winning baseball.On that theme, I’m looking closely at the Russell 2000 Index (IWM). Small caps and large caps performed very differently in 2016. Large caps were generally in favor due to their relatively low volatility and risk. However, I see potential for growth in the small caps over the next several weeks. From the looks of the chart, I’m probably not alone!J: Are you worried that small cap stocks might be overbought?O: What I see is strength.J: What if the small-cap sector fades?O: As I always do, I’ll dump it and move to what is working. I always like to have my money working.J: Does that mean that you are getting ready for March Madness?O: That is where a longshot can really work.J: I suppose we are going to hear more on that subject.O: You can count on it!J: Do you have your updated sector ratings?O: Yes. I monitor about 40 sectors and hold positions in the top three. $IWM is a new holding. It is not on the list because no readers asked about it.HolmesThis week I’m buying Yelp (NYSE:YELP), an internet content and information provider in the U.S. (34.66)Although it traded at 97 in 2014, I have no illusions that it is going back there. Instead I like this stock because it’s showing some resilience at the 32.5 level. Trading down to 32.5 in late October this stock rebounded all the way to 42.5 before getting pounded again down towards the 32.5 price. BUT, it didn’t get there before turning up. So now we have a stop, (32.5), and a price target of 42, with a current price of 34.66. I like the risk/reward this setup provides. Plus, I like the name; it reminds me of my pack when I was a young pup.J: Are you worried about overbought stocks?H: Never! I let others chase the recent winners. I find strong stocks experiencing a temporary setback. I don’t need to worry about “overbought” market conditions.ConclusionThe term “overbought” can mean many different things. Effective trading systems use recent trends and technical indicators in quite different ways. No single method has a monopoly on success. Drawing upon expert systems, let’s highlight three key conclusions.If you like selling the rips and buying the dips, do not take a momentum approach. Check out our post on dip-buying.

4060798,101421,2017-04-06T12:08:33-04:00,Online reputation company Yelp is acquiring Turnstyle Analytics for $20 million up front cash.Turnstyle provides local retailers with a Wi-Fi-based marketing and loyalty rewards system.The deal promises to efficiently expand Yelp's offerings into multiple service areas and I'm bullish on its possibilities.,"Quick TakeBusiness review and recommendation firm Yelp (YELP) has acquired Wi-Fi marketing company Turnstyle Analytics for $20 million in cash.Turnstyle provides local businesses with the ability to better engage their prospects and customers via on-site marketing.The acquisition is a smart and efficient deal by Yelp, and I expect positive results in the near to medium term.Target CompanyToronto, Canada-based Turnstyle was founded in 2012 by CEO Devon Wright, Chris Gilpin, Matt Hunter and Nav Sangha to provide location-based marketing capabilities for retail stores.CEO Wright previously had no technology startup experience and came from the finance industry having worked in two junior positions at large banking firm TD.Below is a brief explainer video about the company’s approach:(Source: Turnstyle Analytics)The company’s system enables retailers to offer a free local Wi-Fi hotspot and provide the prospect or customer with digital loyalty rewards via digital coupons and automated messaging.Turnstyle had at least two known investment rounds, which totaled $4.1 million from undisclosed angel investors. The company claims to support ‘nearly 3,500 business locations worldwide.’Acquisition Terms, Rationale and CommentaryYelp is paying $20 million in upfront cash for Turnstyle.It is likely that this is a ‘team and technology’ acquisition, rather than based on Turnstyle’s revenue numbers.As such, the acquisition price was probably derived from a ‘build or buy’ approach, and Yelp decided it was better to ‘buy’ the technology in order to speed its go-to-market plans.Yelp sells its online reputation management services to brick-and-mortar retailers, so it is a natural extension of that service offering to assist retailers in marketing to and retaining prospects and customers while they are in the retailer’s store.By expanding its service offerings, Yelp improves the value proposition to retailers and provides another selling point for its sales force. Selling to individual retail locations is a cost-intensive process, so being able to spread those costs over greater revenue opportunities is an efficient way to expand on the core business.Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman said, “We’re excited to expand our product offering for local businesses through this acquisition. Turnstyle helps connect businesses to consumers through free public Wi-Fi, and is an effective retention and loyalty program that helps businesses be more successful.”As Stoppelman suggested, the Turnstyle deal also provides an entrée into loyalty program management.By developing a network of retail customers, Yelp also creates the ability to be the gatekeeper for a range of loyalty program capabilities between providers and retailers.So, the deal provides an important building block for a loyalty program platform on which to build additional service offerings to retailers as the competition for offline business vs. online continues to sharpen.Finally, the data provided by in-store prospect and customer activity can be aggregated and monetized in various ways to further benefit retailers and analysts.I view the acquisition as a definite positive for Yelp, as it smartly expands its offering to retailers in an efficient manner.I write about IPOs and M&A deals.

The growth will be driven by digital media, which is expected to grow from $38 million in 2015 to $66 million in 2020, recording a 12% annualized growth rate. During the same period, traditional media, which includes print advertising, is expected to shrink marginally from $103.3 million to $102.8 million.Yelp's FinancialsYelp's (NYSE:YELP) third quarter revenues grew 30% over the year to $186.2 million, ahead of the market's expectations of $182.92 million. EPS of $0.22 per share also was significantly ahead of the market's forecast earnings of $0.18 per share.By segment, revenues from local advertising grew 41% to $163.6 million. Transactions revenues grew 33% to $15.9 million and other revenues increased 1% to $6.8 million.In operating metrics, Yelp reported that cumulative reviews grew 29% over the year to 115 million. App unique devices grew 24% to 25 million and active local advertising business accounts grew 30% over the year to 135,000. Total transaction volume for Yelp, which includes completed transactions and bookings through its Eat24, Yelp Reservations and Yelp Platform apps grew 39% over the year. During the quarter, 77 million monthly unique visitors came to Yelp using their desktop site while 72 million monthly unique users visited Yelp using the mobile app.For the current year, Yelp forecast revenues of $709-713 million, ahead of the market's forecast of $707.6 million. It expects revenues of $191-195 million for the quarter, against the Street's estimates of $192 million.Yelp's New ServicesEarlier in the year, Yelp had released a Request-a-Quote feature that allowed users to get a price estimate for services that they wanted to use. Since its launch, the service has seen strong adoption. During the quarter, consumer adoption of the feature grew by 20%. The service also is witnessing support from business owners as nearly 75% of requests were responded to within 24 hours of the request. The feature has helped improve engagement on the business owner app as well as business owner logins, which have more than doubled over the year.Earlier last quarter, Yelp entered into a partnership with Pittsburgh-based Nowait. Nowait is a mobile platform with tie-ups with more than 4,000 casual dining restaurants across the country. Its app allows users to see the expected wait time at restaurants that do not accept reservations and also allows them to put their names on the wait list without being present there. Once the table is ready, users get a text message to inform them. As part of the partnership, Yelp invested $8 million in Nowait and has integrated its app into its platform to allow Yelp users to add themselves to restaurant wait lists. Yelp has also invested $8 million in the partnership.Meanwhile, Yelp is also re-evaluating its spending priorities. During the quarter, it announced plans to wind down sales and marketing activities outside the US and Canada so that it can focus its selling efforts in the North America region only. While Yelp had been expanding its international presence, it hadn't seen much benefits. For the year to date, Yelp saw a mere $5 million in revenues from the international markets compared with an investment of more than $10 million made in these regions during the period. The reduction will require Yelp to lay off 175 jobs in these locations, which translates to a severance cost of $2-4 million during the coming quarters.The market is relieved with Yelp's focus on margins and customer engagement. The stock soared 10% on the results announcement. It is currently trading at $38.29 with a market cap of $2.96 billion. It has recovered from the 52-week low of $14.53 it had fallen to in February this year. It had touched a 52-week high of $43.36 last month."
4045206,22148,2017-02-12T18:21:44-05:00,Yelp dipped on perceived weak Q1 guidance.Conservative 2016 guidance provided a similar dip that made for a good buying opportunity.The stock has a compelling valuation despite the big rally last year.,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) traded down a sharp 14% on Friday following what the market saw as weak guidance. The market is overlooking some promising metrics in the process.The stock is up sharply from the early 2016 lows so possibly a pause was needed. The market, though, needs to pay more attention to the value proposition of Yelp and not where the stock traded last year.For Q4, Yelp showed the strong ability to leverage growth on the consumer review platform. The company generated a profit that far exceeded estimates and even produced a GAAP profit of $0.10 despite a restructuring charge and stock-based compensation.The prime reason for the stock dip was the guidance that Q1 revenues wouldn't meet analyst estimates. This number, along with full-year guidance, provided multiple ways for interpretation.For Q1, sequentially flat revenues at $195 to $199 million was far below the analyst estimates at $204 million. Yet, the company guided towards a doubling of adjusted EBITDA to $26.5 million from Q1 levels last year of only $13 million.Another point is that the company guided to 2017 revenues of $880 to $900 million. The midpoint of the guidance at $890 million was a tad below analyst estimates at $895 million, but Yelp guided in a similarly conservative manner for 2016.With the Q4 report last February, Yelp predicted that 2016 revenues would reach $680 to $700 million. The consumer review site ended up reporting revenues of $713 million for 2016.Yelp beat the original midpoint guidance of $690 million by $23 million or 3.3%. A similar beat for the 2017 guidance would equate to revenues of roughly $920 million and far above analyst estimates.At the end of the day, Yelp originally guided towards 2016 revenue growth of 26% and is now guiding towards 2017 growth of 25%. Investors have no reason to panic on the guidance numbers.So, while the guidance is no reason to panic, the valuation is extremely compelling. In comparison to other Internet stocks that live off advertising revenues, Yelp offers by far the better value in comparison to other stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).YELP PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe key investor takeaway is that Yelp offers a company throwing off solid cash flows and an attractive valuation. The market doesn't offer many stocks growing revenues at 25% and trading at an incredibly low forward P/S multiple, especially for a platform that offers the holy grail of local advertising."
4032279,22148,2016-12-22T14:28:03-05:00,RBC survey results show the brand recognition and popularity of Yelp growing.The company has plenty of catalyst for growth.Its stock remains reasonably cheap for a company that is harnessing the Holy Grail of local advertising.,"For anybody following the Yelp (NYSE:YELP) story since the IPO, the recent RBC Capital Markets survey results (via Barron's) are mind blowing. The consumer review site saw its stock crushed from the early 2014 highs due to fears slowing user growth and sales practices around the quality of the reviews on the site.The stock plummeted all the way below $10 to start this year. Now the question is whether investors should follow analyst Mark Mahaney and RBC to the $55 price target.RBC SurveyUsers and businesses were supposedly turned off from the Yelp site due to unsavory sales practices threatening small businesses with bad reviews if they didn't advertise on the site. As well, a documentary questioned the quality of the reviews suggesting people were placing fake reviews to boost specific small businesses.The RBC survey actually shows that the exact opposite has occurred. According to a survey of 2,800 U.S. consumers, the brand recognition is now at 100%, up from only 66% back in 2014. As well, the amount of respondents likely to use the service in the future is growing. Around 71% of people responding to the survey plan to use Yelp, up from 63% in 2015.All of the survey stats show the incredible usefulness of the site once deemed to not have a future.Encouraged by the survey results, RBC recommends Yelp as the #1 small cap for 2017 even after the huge rally off the lows. The $55 price target provides 43% upside from here. Maybe more incredible is that the RBC target is only back to 50% of the all-time high.CatalystsAs presented in my investment thesis for a long time, including when Yelp cratered in 2015, the company was producing fast growth despite the negative headlines on user growth and the questions surrounding review quality and sales practices. Revenues, reviews, and general engagement continued to generate records.What was missed is the fact that many power users were shifting to the mobile app. These users were using the service 10x more than ones finding the website via a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search.Source: Yelp Q316 presentationThe end result is that Yelp ends 2016 with greater control of its own destiny now that the brand is well recognized. The app provides the Holy Grail to advertisers of local users on a mobile phone searching for the best restaurant in the general area. The exact reason why the amount of local advertisers continues to expand at a 30% clip to 135,000.At the same time, Yelp is moving beyond consumer reviews to transactions. The shift into transactions provides the next growth opportunity. The company grew transactions by 39% during Q3.Source: Yelp Q316 presentationThe important key is that despite the recent rally and solving the holy grail of local advertising, Yelp isn't expensive. The stock is nowhere as expensive as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) on a P/S multiple.YELP PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsAlso, don't forget that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) recently closed the deal for LinkedIn at roughly 6x forward sales estimates. Yelp still trades at roughly half that multiple.TakeawayThe key investor takeaway is that Yelp is a top pick by RBC because the stock remains cheap even after the rally. Key engagement metrics continue to expand making the stock worth holding for the RBC price target."

In this article we are going to compare the financial performance of Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB) and Yelp (NYSE:YELP), two social/mobile tech companies servicing the restaurant industry as an alternative way to gain exposure to this explosive industry.Grub has fashioned a business model around online food delivery. The company currently connects consumers with 45,000 restaurants in 1,100 U.S. cities and London, U.K.Yelp's business is focused on connecting people with local businesses through consumer reviews. The company was originally known for restaurant reviews but has expanded into reviews of almost every type of local business and has established communities in 32 countries outside of the U.S.The purpose of this article is not to dissect their respective business (although some anecdotal comments may be offered) there's plenty of opinion and information available on each company for those interested in understanding each business in more detail. Instead, this article is to do a side by side comparison of approximately 40 financial metrics as reported by Marketsmith. The article will also look at the technical trading characteristics and institutional support of each stock.We'll start with the following overview.The companies are nearly the same market capitalization but Grub is currently trading at a premium (based on a higher PE) to Yelp. Grubs superior earning performance and future estimates helps explain the premium the stock is currently receiving. Interestingly, Yelp has delivered approximately 50% more in actual sales over the last 4 quarters. Let's take a look at the actual quarterly sales and growth rate.Both companies are experiencing strong sales growth. The deceleration in Yelp's sales growth (40% four quarters ago to 30% in the recent quarter) is something to keep an eye on especially as the company expands into new service categories. Both companies have experienced some sales growth deceleration. Going back to the September 2014 quarter Yelp reported sales growth of 67%, Grub 75%.Let's now take a closer look at earnings.When it comes to making money Grub has clearly done a better job which is also reflected in the MarketSmith EPS Rating for Grub of 95 versus 39 for Yelp. A rating of 95 suggests Grub has outperformed 95% of all publicly traded companies in earnings. Part of Yelp's underperformance is explained below where R&D expenditures are compared. MarketSmith's EPS Rating is proprietary but combines a company's most recent two quarters of EPS growth with its three-year to five-year annual growth rate. Clearly Grub has done a better job of producing profits up to this point.Below are a few other financial metrics to compare.Notice Grub's pre-tax margin compared to Yelp's . This may help explain why Grub has been able to drop more money to the bottom line. Also interesting is the amount of spending the Yelp is doing in R&D. If this spending pays off for Yelp in the long run it could be a big win. Neither company has an impressive return on equity.Up to this point it appears Yelp has been more ambitious in its business pursuits going after several many review categories where Grub has focused on the food delivery business. Internationally Yelp has also been more aggressive. Both could be reasons for the superior financial performance of Grub up to this point.From a competitive perspective GRUB has aggressive competition coming after their market; it will be interesting to see how well they can defend their business going forward. Yelp appears to be going after already established competition by expanding into markets already served by other competitors.Before we move into a technical look at the trading for these stocks the following information might be helpful.Over the last few years Yelp's mutual fund support hit a low during the quarter ending March 2016 at 236 funds, down from 464 reported at the end of the September 2014 quarter. The big 18.2% jump in fund ownership is the first quarterly rise in 7 quarters. Also, only one of the select funds GDT follows is listed as currently owning shares, down significantly from earlier in 2014 when 10 of these funds reported owning Yelp.Grub institutional support has also waned, peaking during the September 2015 quarter with 415 funds reporting shares. Currently 313 funds report owning Grub and 4 come from the select list GDT tracks, down from 8 in April of 2015.Institutional support data is imperfect and historical in nature but at this stage both of these stocks have plenty of additional room for more institutional buyers to report ownership. For example, LinkedIn (LNKD) reported 962 institutional owners as of the quarter ending June 2016.In terms of short interest, the valuation of Yelp is currently more attractive which may be tempting the shorts to try and bring down Grub. This could also turn into a catalyst for more price appreciation if the broad market continues to rally and Grub participates causing the shorts to cover.Let's take a look at how the two stocks are trading. We begin with a 90-day chart that shows the gap-up post earnings both stocks experienced.Both stocks appear to have handled their gaps up well and were in uptrends leading into earnings.Next we will take a longer term view.Both stocks have spent most of the last two years in nasty corrections. Grub is very close to breaking out above resistance in the low $40's and if it is able to do so could be the start of another bullish leg up. Yelp appears to have more consistent institutional activity but much of that appears to be selling during the decline. Yelp has more overhead to work through and will need to advance approximately 25% to get to the next resistance level which could be a nice swing trade.Next we will look at the price and volume action using the Point & Figure (PNF) method. If you are unfamiliar with this charting technique, there is plenty of information available on the web for those interested in learning more. GDT likes to combine traditional charts with PnF when evaluating a stock's price action.Both of the PnF charts are based on daily prices and show most of the trading in 2016. There are a couple of unique difference that can be spotted between the two PnF charts. First, the recent price consolidation since the gap of for Grub is a sloppy compared to the nice tight action of Yelp. More time has elapsed since the Grub gap so it has had more time to move around but overall Yelp appears to be a better set-up. The other difference is the massive volume Yelp has seen during periods of price advances since May. The column of X's with the red 5 marks the start of May on the Yelp PnF chart.In summary, both stocks offer promise via good fundamentals but a couple of blemishes prevent them from being the very best aggressive growth stock from a fundamental perspective. Both stocks are seeing institutional support but it appears Yelp is attracting more support at present which could help the stock move up to the next price resistance level which would be around a 20%+ gain.From a business model perspective Grub's pure-play focus on food delivery may offer execution advantages versus Yelp's expansion into customer reviews for a variety of consumer services. Grub's number one ranking in the Internet-Content industry group is a vote for that stock.Similar to Priceline's (PCLN) acquisition of OpenTable, both Grub and Yelp may turn out to be attractive acquisition candidates as the social/mobile tech market continues to consolidate.Neither company meets the criteria we require and if the market continues to rally both stocks look poised to participate further to the upside.MarketSmith Data DefinitionsReturn on Equity: The amount of net income returned as a percentage of shareholders' equity.Debt Level: Calculated by dividing long-term debt by shareholders' equity.Annual Pre-Tax Margin: Calculated by dividing annual operating income by sales.Cash Flow Vs.

4053191,102329,2017-03-08T11:45:45-05:00,"Growth is happening in many areas, including revenue, adjusted EBITDA, local advertisers and mobile app usage.Realizing the failure of its international expansion, bringing resources back to the U.S. was a good management decision.Yelp is not just a search engine for restaurants, it has been tapping into other small businesses and the potential continues to be great.Yelp continues to be an attractive company to own because of its relevance in local listing and M&A possibilities.","OverviewSince its IPO in 2012, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) has been through many ups and downs. The stock went from $16 in 2012 to $97 in 2014, then back to $16 in 2016, a true roller-coaster ride. During that time span, the company also put itself up for sale but didn't succeed.After its most recent quarterly and full-year earnings report, the stock is currently trading at around $34, and we think the stock is finally stabilizing and is worth taking a look at. Yelp also recently made an important strategic decision, by stopping its international expansion to focus only on the U.S. and Canadian markets, and new initiatives on its mobile app, including cash back and request a quote. We believe these initiatives will provide great user engagement and help drive monetization.Yelp's continuation in finding new ways to monetize its product and connecting users with local merchants makes it a great local advertiser. In many ways, its offerings are much stickier than those from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), and it is also a sell-side research analyst's top pick for 2017.Yelp's GrowthFinancially, 2016 was a great year for Yelp, coming off a struggling 2015. Revenue and adjusting EBITDA are growing steadily and net income has been in the positive during the past three quarters. Top-line revenue increased by 30% in 2016 and company guidance is 25% for 2017. On its most recent earnings call, management talked about achieving an adjusted EBITDA margin of 35-40% in the long run, compared to less than 17% for 2016. Much of the margin improvement will likely come from cost reduction in sales & marketing, as the brand name matures and solidifies. If such a margin can occur, then the annual adjusted EBITDA can potentially top $300+ million soon, compared to $120 million in 2016.On the usage side, mobile usage has increased substantially that it now accounts for 73% of all searches. The increase is an evidence of Yelp's successful mobile platform and such increase represents increasing monetization opportunities for Yelp.M&A PossibilitiesThere has been much talk of Yelp being a buyout candidate and the company did attempt to sell itself once. However, no offer was revealed. When looking at comparable transactions, one interesting company comes to mind - the OpenTable deal by Priceline (PCLN) back in June 2014 for $2.6 billion in cash.When comparing their businesses, OpenTable was mainly an online restaurant reservation company with annual revenue less than $200 million in 2013 compared to Yelp's $700 million in 2016. Obviously, Yelp's business model is much stronger than OpenTable's. First, it is not simply a restaurant-focused platform, only 18% of Yelp's reviewed businesses are restaurants. Its small business portfolio also includes home improvement vendors, spas & salons, artists, fitness centers, auto dealers, doctors and much more.Besides having similar restaurant reservation capability, Yelp also offers online food ordering through its Eat24 program, requesting a quote and cash back. At $34 a share ($2.7 billion market cap), it deserves a much higher valuation if it were to be bought out by a tech giant.ConclusionWe think it's a smart move by Yelp to scale back from its effort to expand internationally. After several years of investments and setting up 30+ offices overseas, it finally realized that Yelp is a failure outside of the U.S and Canada, simply because it can't compete with the local players. Revenues from abroad barely contributed 2% of its overall revenue as of fiscal year 2015. By stopping its international expansion and putting the focus back on the U.S. and Canada, finding new ways to monetize its application, Yelp will continue to grow its top line. We expect a profitable 2017 from Yelp and believe there is great upside in the stock, even if it does not get acquired.The current price is a good entry point to start accumulating Yelp stock."
4018308,22148,2016-11-02T14:00:56-04:00,Yelp generated strong Q3 results that easily surpassed analyst estimates.The consumer review site constantly grows all key metrics despite the volatile stock price.The stock offers a unique value that is typically overlooked by the market.,"For several quarters now, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) has smashed quarterly results and surged some 10% on the earnings beat. Despite a focus on the holy grail of local advertising, the market was burned by the stock collapse in 2015 and early 2016 and still apparently underestimates the growth opportunity each quarter.Now trading around $36, Yelp still trades far below the 2014 highs over $100. Despite the consumer review site producing outstanding growth metrics, is there any reason the rally should stop?The amazing part of the Yelp story is that the market was so focused on the stalling monthly users' metrics back a few years ago that the real investment thesis was missed. Due in part to the moves by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) to block Yelp in search results, the consumer review site saw stalling growth from new users.The investor community missed the shift to the mobile app where the hardcore user is around 10x more engaged. In the latest quarter, the app's unique devices grew 24% YoY to 24.9 million. Roughly' 1.9 million additional devices used the mobile app in Q3 for one of the largest growth levels in the history of the app.Other key numbers that should've signaled high engagement despite stalling total users were the constantly growing reviews and local advertising accounts. For Q3, cumulative reviews grew 29% to approximately 115 million. When the stock peaked back in Q1 '14, the reviews sat at only 57 million.While the amount of users is important to growth, the amount of local advertisers is key to growing local ad revenue. The amount of local ad accounts grew 30% YoY to 135,000, up from only 63,300 when the stock peaked.All of this brings us back to the completely missed story on Yelp. The company has consistently grown revenues because engagement and advertisers on the site have constantly grown nearly unabated.YELP data by YChartsFor Q3, revenues grew 30% over the same period last year. The guidance for Q4 is for revenues surging 26% to another record high of $195 million. With a $3.2 million beat for the last quarter, one could easily see Yelp generate revenues of nearly $200 million.All of these numbers that validate the consistent growth of the company highlights why the valuation of the stock makes no sense. Compared to a group of stocks such as LinkedIn (LNKD) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Yelp constantly trades at a valuation discount.YELP EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsThe local advertising market is enormous so the total addressable market isn't a limiting factor in the equation.The key investor takeaway is that Yelp is constantly generating results pushing the business higher. Despite the rally off the lows, the current stock price remains an opportunity to benefit from the long-term growth opportunity in the local ad market."

Ever since that brief period, the stock's road has been downhill. But today, a minute piece of nostalgia hit Yelp investors as the stock began to trade at roughly a third of that $100.00 figure from 2014.The company beat on earnings per share for the first time in the past four quarters while also beating revenue expectations. As a result, Yelp (NYSE: YELP) is trading at around $37.00 today; a 14% increase.Source: YahooFinanceTwo financial advisories, Axiom Capital and Mizuho, upgraded their Yelp recommendations from Neutral/Hold to Buy this morning due to their quarterly profit boost. The company surprised analysts by posting a GAAP net income of $0.4 million in the second quarter of 2016. This equates to an EPS of about a penny per share. Compared to the second quarter of 2015, in which Yelp posted a GAAP net loss of $1.3 million or $0.02 a share. Although modest, this kind of a gain in EPS shows a promising future for the company that many analysts might have overlooked.The highlight of Yelp's Q2 financial report was undoubtedly revenue increase. Both local and net revenue realized substantial gains. Net revenue of $173.4 million reflected an increase of 30% from Q2 of 2015. Local revenue, driven by local advertisement, was even more impressive and totaled $151.9 million which is reflective of 41% growth compared to Q2 of 2015.So what exactly was Yelp doing correctly in this past quarter?Source: Press ReleaseIn addition to the list above, Yelp claims to have realized over 300 million connections in the past quarter. In a company statement, CEO Jeremy Stoppelman credits this to an increase in ""mobile calls, clicks for map views and directions, food orders, restaurant reservations, and new reviews...""On Yelp, users can review and post comments about hundreds of thousands of local businesses. Yelp relies on platforms such as Google to direct traffic to its site, however, Google is now a main competitor. Google reviews now allows users to provide feedback on places they have visited by simply Googling the business. This, unfortunately, might counteract any increase in demand that Yelp realized through Q2.But, like Google, Yelp has evolved to become a much more multifaceted network. In acquiring both SeatMe and Eat24 as of the past two years, Yelp has taken on a role much larger than a review site. While users before would use Yelp to review/read up on businesses, they can now order, get directions, and make reservations from its platform (most commonly the phone application). Creating this user marketplace has allowed Yelp to compete with the larger brands at a much higher rate of success. This is especially true with Google, as users can now reach Yelp directly instead of attempting to navigate through Google.(A look at Yelp's ""One-Stop-Shop"" features)Source: Android AppsHowever, combating an internet behemoth such as Google, which is now pushing its own listings, is not an easy task. Especially with publicity over fake reviews that have been emerging in recent news, a sense of distrust is now being attributed to the company. Yelp called off its plans to sell itself to larger buyers last year and is now having to compete with them. Yelp realized steady declines throughout 2015, but is now trading up consistently for the first quarter since 2014.From its IPO in 2012, Yelp has had its fair share of ups and downs. Its ups are mainly correlated with the buzz attributed to all new tech companies in 2012; however, it carried that momentum far into 2014. From that point forward, business has been rocky.Source: Seeking AlphaInvestors are now skeptical if this growth is here to stay or if they should take their earnings and run. With a new Chief Operating Officer, many are attributing this quarter's profit margins to a new business turnaround.Looking ahead to Quarter 3:Source: Press ReleaseAnalysts are projecting Yelp to take in about $179.6 million in revenue for the current quarter, per Thomson Reuters. While Yelp's managerial team has higher hopes for the quarter/year than analysts project, they certainly have the infrastructure to attain their goals. With revamping and restructuring, Yelp will soon become an acquirer of smaller tech startups to keep momentum rolling through this quarter.Yelp expects to range its revenue for all of 2016 from $700 million to $708 million, with adjusted EBITDA to range from $100 million to $108 million. Both are increases of around 25% from last year's halfway marker.With a recent interest in Nowait, a startup that estimates restaurant wait times, Yelp's brand can only grow. Even if you are not a Yelp reviewer yourself, with a multi-faceted platform like the one coming in this next quarter, it might be tough to stay away from the application.The truth is, as Jeremy Stoppelman stated in an earnings call, ""The number of Yelp powered connections is growing faster today than it was a year ago."" Anytime a company executive can say that and have it be true means the company is in pretty good standing. Q2 revenue markers have corroborated that statement and investors are looking for the same result in Q3.As Yelp's momentum carries it rapidly through the internet information provider pond, investors are casting their lines in hopes of cashing in on the growing brand."
4019141,101941,2016-11-03T16:36:27-04:00,"Yelp turned a net profit of $2 million in Q3 2016 but has decided to halt global expansion and trim its workforce by 4%.The idea that Yelp was going to be this ""global broker"" between customers and virtually every single business in the world is beginning to unravel.Even if Yelp doubles net income to $20M within 10 years, a 30x premium on those earnings suggests only a $600M market cap (approximately $7.56 per share), a 79% decline.","As much as I prefer to find strong companies trading at a discount that can be held for the long term, there's simply too many overpriced stocks these days that are beginning to show blatant signs of cracking from the weight of its own overvaluation, and Yelp (YELP) is one of them.Yelp turned a net profit of $2 million in Q3 2016 but has decided to halt global expansion and trim their workforce by 4%. Yelp's co-founder and CEO Jeremy Stoppelman  stated that although the US segment continues to grow, the company hasn't ""achieved the same level of traction internationally"" and that management has decided to ""redirect our resources towards the domestic opportunity for now.""This should streamline the business operations in terms of costs and perhaps even accelerate top-line growth due to more efficiency and focus. However, without global expansion, should anyone really be buying at Yelp at a valuation north of $2.8 billion, approximately $36 per share?Every single annual report up until this point has stated that international market penetration is one of the key factors to Yelp's growth, and as of today, that's off the table and I'm not buying Stoppelman's use of the two magic words: ""for now."" Yelp's decision to leave the international market alone and focus domestically is probably more permanent than temporary. But without an actual timeline, it's better not to speculate. Either way, it's probable that many investors never priced this scenario into the stock and find themselves suddenly without a floor underneath them.I have initiated a short position in Yelp. While Yelp is not a zero, it's overvalued enough for a short-seller to make a respectable profit on any potential downside. At this point, I believe it's a trade worth taking.Why I'm Shorting Yelp1. Yelp already shopped itself around to be acquired in 2015 and no one was willing to pay the asking price. In my view, the risk of a buyout that doubles or triples Yelp's stock price is decreased, making Yelp a ""safe-to-short"" stock.2. Yelp just reported earnings, which means all the cards are on the table now. Starting today, there will be another three months of people sitting around worrying about what to do with their positions before the next scheduled volatility event.3. Over 80% of YELP is owned by institutions. This is a ""crowded long"" and if any of these institutions decide to sell, it could cause a substantial share price decline.4. Only 5.9% of shares are short. A short squeeze that can ""gap"" the stock price is unlikely.5. Actual insiders own less than 4% of the stock. Typically this signals ""less faith"" by insiders as opposed to a stock with high insider ownership, but in this particular case it's not too big of a deal in my opinion - but still worth mentioning.6. Yelp is overvalued on an absolute basis. It doesn't matter that Yelp traded at $100 per share in 2014 - that was 2014, when hopes were much higher for Yelp, before the oil crash, before Brexit, before Hillary vs. Trump, and before Yelp's management decided to halt global expansion. Yelp is now trading 64% lower since 2014. Believe me, that doesn't make Yelp a bargain, and anyone calling Yelp cheap based on a ""relative measurement"" without actually considering the absolute price they are paying for Yelp's future prospects is making a classic investment mistake. Yelp's asset base and the strength of its cash-flow generation is not as strong as the market has priced it. Here's my argument:a. Yelp can probably get its business to generate around $8.3M to $10M in net income annually within the next three years if everything goes to plan. But even a 60 multiple on that $10M net income only amounts to a $600M market cap (approximately $7.56 per share) - 79% lower than the current $36 price per share and $2.8B market cap.b. And even if Yelp doubles net income to $20M in 10 years, a 30 multiple on those earnings is only $600 million market cap (approximately $7.56 per share), again, 79% lower than the current $36 price per share and $2.8B market cap. Why the lower multiple? Simple: more penetration, less growth available. And once a company stops growing, multiples typically move to 25 and below depending on the sector - 30 is generous.7. Yelp is attempting to function as a value-added middleman in the cyclical sector - a sector which is showing signs of slowing down. Many retailers are facing significant headwinds (especially shopping malls and retailers who are losing business to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and online shopping), restaurant sales are slowing, and automobile manufacturers such as Nissan (OTCPK:NSANY), Honda (NYSE:HMC) and Toyota (NYSE:TM) have all reported lower sales in October compared to last year. If the business cycle of economic prosperity is indeed coming to an end and moving into the contraction period of the cyclical cycle, then advertising spend on Yelp is sure to suffer.Basically, at Yelp's current prices, there is no margin of safety. Take a look at what happened to Fitbit (FIT) today: a company which had no debt, was increasing top and bottom-line growth, and yet the stock still crashed 30% after earnings. Or Facebook (FB) which reported absolutely jaw-dropping earnings growth yesterday, yet still experienced a sharp correction. The reason these things happen are simple - people pay too much for growth.Even though Yelp has declined from $100 per share to $36 per share, Yelp is still overvalued, and the story that Yelp was going to be this ""global broker"" between customers and virtually every single business in the world is beginning to unravel."
4003338,24157,2016-08-31T10:11:40-04:00,"Yelp’s economic earnings have declined from -$28 million in 2012 to -$75 million in 2015 and to -$90 million over the last twelve months.Meanwhile, since 2013, Yelp’s adjusted EBITDA has grown from $29 million to $71 million TTM.Yelp's current valuation implies the company is already highly profitable, but can maintain such profitability for years into the future.","Despite significant deterioration of business fundamentals, this firm has seen its share price rise over 30% year-to-date. Investors have bought into a growth story that not only fails to produce profits, but has proven false in the past. With growing losses, significant competition, and a highly overvalued stock, Yelp Inc. (NYSE:YELP) is this week's Danger Zone.Revenue Growth Doesn't Reach The Bottom LineYelp's economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, have declined from -$28 million in 2012 to -$75 million in 2015 and to -$90 million over the last twelve months (TTM). Meanwhile, revenue has grown from $138 million in 2012 to $550 million in 2015, or 59% compounded annually, and even further to $629 million TTM. See Figure 1. See the reconciliation of YELP's GAAP net income to economic earnings here.Figure 1: Economic Earnings Fall While Revenue RisesSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsYelp's return on invested capital (ROIC) has fallen from 7% in 2014 to a bottom quintile -3% TTM. The company's after-tax profit (NOPAT) margins have also declined from 7% in 2014 to -3% TTM. Lastly, Yelp has burned through cumulative $465 million in free cash flow since 2013.Executive Compensation Plan Only Emphasizes Share PriceExecutives at Yelp, apart from base salaries, receive short and long-term equity compensation. In some instances, such as the CEO, base salary is set at $1, and equity compensation is used instead. To bridge the gap between low salaries and the compensation of its peer group, the company uses a mix of equity awards that vest over four years, and awards that vest monthly for two years.Additionally, Yelp lists 40 separate metrics that its compensation committee can use to determine performance awards, including non-GAAP items such as bookings, billings, or user satisfaction. Yelp also lays out specific adjustments that can be made when determining performance goals such as excluding restructuring charges or the effects of stock-based compensation.With such a large portion of executive compensation tied to Yelp's stock price, and monthly vesting schedules in some cases, management must consistently meet the market's expectations to ensure they get paid. The ""pressure to perform"" could lead to exploiting accounting loopholes to manipulate earnings, which is more prevalent than most investors realize.Just as bad, acquisitions with terrible economics can grow EPS per the high-low fallacy. Lastly, incentives focused only on share price can lead to decisions that maximize short-term gains at the expense of long term, sustainable cash flows, something we've witnessed before.Ideally, all executives would be incentivized through ROIC. ROIC is the best way to create shareholder value and align executives with the best interest of shareholders because there is a clear correlation between ROIC and shareholder value.Non-GAAP's Positive Story Amidst Negative Economic EarningsCompanies with significant losses can use non-GAAP metrics in an attempt to paint the business in a more positive light. Yelp's use of adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP net income perfectly illustrates the dangers of non-GAAP metrics. Here are some of the expenses YELP has removed when calculating its non-GAAP metrics:The removal of these costs allows Yelp to report growth in non-GAAP metrics despite economic earnings heading the opposite direction. In 2015, Yelp removed nearly $61 million in stock-based compensation (11% of revenue), among other expenses, to turn a $33 million GAAP loss into a $29 million non-GAAP profit. In 2014, Yelp removed $42 million in stock-based compensation, which was 116% of GAAP net income.Since 2013, Yelp's adjusted EBITDA has grown from $29 million to $71 million TTM. Meanwhile, economic earnings declined from -$25 million to -$90 million over the same time and free cash flow has remained negative and sits at -$36 million TTM, per Figure 2.Figure 2: YELP's Misleading Non-GAAP MetricSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsYelp's Negative Profitability Lags In A Largely Undifferentiated MarketYelp's primary business is based around collecting advertising revenue from businesses. From a consumer perspective, Yelp's service provides ways to discover new businesses as well as reviews of said businesses. Its ancillary services allow for reservations, food ordering/delivery, and quote requests from service businesses.Unfortunately for Yelp, it faces competition from every angle. Figure 3 lists many different competitors and how they stack up to Yelp. From reviews, to restaurants, to overall business listings, it's clear that Yelp operates in a highly competitive market. Remove Yelp from the market, and any of the firms below would fill the void.We do not think that being a digital version of the yellow pages makes Yelp's business meaningfully stronger than the offline version of yellow pages. As we have stated about Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), there is no sustainable value creation in businesses that are built around leveraging the Internet to deliver content.Just doing something over the Internet does not, by itself, create a viable business especially when it comes to content. The value, as it always has been, is in high quality original content. Consequently, we see Yelp as an undifferentiated distributor of commoditized content that will follow a similar lifecycle to the offline yellow pages.Figure 3: Yelp Vs. CompetitionSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsThough many of these competitors focus on one subset of a market, or one service type (e.g. restaurants), this list, which includes firms such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), and Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI) is by no means exhaustive. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains a large competitor, with its search business and its own reviews.Additionally, local radio and newspaper outlets, not to mention firms not listed above, such as the Better Business Bureau, Thumbtack, Zagat or even Airbnb, whose city ""guidebooks"" contain local recommendations from travelers, further crowd the market.Yelp's quest to be a one-stop shop has left its profitability lagging the competition. Per Figure 4, Yelp's NOPAT margin ranks well below advertising giants Facebook and Google, but also below firms such as TripAdvisor and GrubHub. In a largely commoditized market, Yelp has little pricing power, an issue exacerbated by its already negative margins.Figure 4: Yelp's Negative ProfitabilitySources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsBull Hopes Ignores Slowing User Growth As Offering Is Increasingly CommoditizedTrying to be all things to all people with respect to connecting consumers with businesses through search, reviews, and advertising has stretched the company's operations thin and led to cash losses. Yelp does not appear to have staked a leadership position in any category. Nevertheless, bulls have overlooked the cash losses and weak competitive position and seem to be drinking the non-GAAP profit and revenue growth Kool-Aid in the first two quarters of this year.At some point, investors will be in for a bad surprise as costs have grown at an equal or greater pace than revenues. Since 2012, Yelp's cost of revenue has grown 73% compounded annually.Its sales & marketing expenses have grown 52% compounded annually while product development and general & administrative costs have grown 74% and 37% compounded annually respectively. In order to grow the top line, Yelp has aggressively spent on sales and product development, all while accumulating greater losses.All this spending should equate to Yelp having a large network of businesses paying for ads, and a large user base that can make the ads worthwhile. However, Yelp's user growth is not only slowing, but actually declining in some areas, per Figure 5.Figure 5: Yelp's Monthly Average UsersSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filingsYelp's monthly average users of its mobile app grew 39% year over year in 3Q15. In 2Q16, that user growth had slowed to 27%. The company's monthly average mobile site users were 69 million in 3Q15 and have largely stagnated since. Not surprising, as consumers move away from traditional desktop computers, the company's monthly average desktop users have declined from 79 million in 3Q15 to 73 million in 2Q16.Meanwhile per Figure 6, Facebook has reported 1.7 billion monthly active users, Google has over 1 billion monthly active users, and TripAdvisor reports 350 million monthly active users. Compared to Yelp, which had 165 million monthly active users in 2Q16, Yelp's user base pales in comparison.Figure 6: Monthly Active Users Across ServiceSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings or press releases*Google's Search, Android, Maps, Chrome, YouTube, Google Play and Gmail each have over one billion monthly active users.*Yelp users consist of monthly app users, monthly mobile web users, and monthly desktop users combined*YP.com users consist of app users and web users combined*OpenTable states it seats 20 million diners per monthLastly, an issue that never seems to disappear when it relates to Yelp is the legitimacy of their reviews. We saw a similar issue when we analyzed Angie's List as well. There are numerous complaints that reviews are fake, inaccurate, or selectively filtered in a way that misrepresents a business.Additionally, there have been complaints of Yelp removing positive reviews when companies fail to pay for advertising, a claim Yelp has denied, yet allegations continue to arise. Whether these complaints are true or not, the legitimacy of Yelp's reviews is at the core of its service, which means anytime issues make the news, businesses may turn away from the service.Looking past the exorbitant costs, the slowing user growth, and questions over legitimate reviews, the largest risk to the bear case is what we call ""stupid money risk,"" which is higher in today's low growth (organic) environment. Another firm could acquire YELP at a value that is much higher than the current market price. As we'll show below, such an acquisition would not be a wise move at current prices.YELP Investors Hoping For A Buyout?The biggest risk to our thesis is that an outside firm acquires YELP at a value at or above today's price. Despite the negative profitability and ample competition, Yelp's review database could provide value in an acquisition. From 2012 to 2015, Yelp's review database grew from 36 million to 95 million. In the first two quarters of 2016, total reviews have grown to 108 million.To build out a similar database, it would take significant time and resources. However, after increasing over 30% YTD, YELP is much more costly to any potential acquirer, and any buyout hope may have passed. In fact, we'll show below that YELP is not an attractive acquisition target unless a buyer is willing to destroy significant shareholder value.To begin, YELP has liabilities of which investors may not be aware that make it more expensive than the accounting numbers suggest.After adjusting for these liabilities, we can model multiple purchase price scenarios. Even in the most optimistic of scenarios, YELP is worth less than the current share price.Figures 7 and 8 show what we think Alphabet should pay for YELP to ensure it does not destroy shareholder value. Alphabet, through Google, already provides advertising to businesses and provides reviews through Google reviews. One could make the case that acquiring Yelp would eliminate competition within the review and advertising space and create a greater user base with which businesses could promote to.However, acquiring Yelp could mean significant crossover in users of the two search services, leaving the value in Yelp's review database. Regardless, there are limits on how much GOOGL would pay for YELP to earn a proper return, given the NOPAT or free cash flows being acquired.Each implied price is based on a 'goal ROIC' assuming different levels of revenue growth. In each scenario, the estimated revenue growth rate in year one equals the consensus estimate for 2016 (29%). For the subsequent years, we use 25% in scenario one because it represents a continuation of 2017 expectations. We use 30% in scenario two under the assumption that a merger with Alphabet would create additional revenue opportunities.We conservatively assume that Alphabet can grow YELP's revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets. We also assume YELP achieves a 9% NOPAT margin, which is the average of Alphabet and Yelp's current NOPAT margins. For reference, YELP's TTM NOPAT margin is -3%, so this assumption implies drastic and immediate improvement, but creates a truly best-case scenario.Figure 7: Implied Acquisition Prices For GOOGL To Achieve 8% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 7 shows the 'goal ROIC' for GOOGL as its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) or 8%. Even if Yelp can grow revenue by 30% compounded annually with a 9% NOPAT margin for the next five years, the firm is not worth more than its current price of $38/share. Assuming the 30% scenario is a best-case view, Alphabet would destroy over $800 million by purchasing YELP at its current valuation. It's also worth noting that any deal that only achieves an 8% ROIC would be only value neutral and not accretive, as the return on the deal would equal GOOGL's WACC.Figure 8: Implied Acquisition Prices For GOOGL To Achieve 27% ROICSources: New Constructs, LLC and company filings.Figure 8 shows the next 'goal ROIC' of 27%, which is GOOGL's current ROIC. Acquisitions completed at these prices would be truly accretive to GOOGL shareholders. Even in the best-case growth scenario, the most Alphabet should pay for YELP is $7/share (80% downside).Assuming this best-case scenario, Alphabet would destroy nearly $2.5 billion by purchasing YELP at its current valuation. Any scenario below 30% CAGR would result in further capital destruction. Furthermore, any deal above $7/share would lower GOOGL's ROIC, thereby destroying shareholder value.On Its Own, YELP Is OvervaluedYELP is up over 30% YTD, despite cash flows becoming increasingly more negative, as seen in Figure 1. Such price appreciation amidst declining fundamentals leaves YELP significantly overvalued. To justify the current price of $38/share, YELP must achieve 6.6% pretax margins (highest ever achieved in 2014, compared to -3% TTM) and grow revenue by 23% compounded annually for the next 14 years.In this scenario, YELP would be generating over $10 billion in revenue 14 years from now, which is greater than MasterCard's (NYSE:MA) 2015 revenue and more than three times greater than Groupon's 2015 revenue.Even if we assume YELP can achieve 6.6% pretax margins and grow revenue by 18% compounded annually for the next decade, the stock is only worth $15/share today - a 60% downside.Each of these scenarios also assumes the company is able to grow revenue and NOPAT without spending on working capital or fixed assets, an assumption that is unlikely, but allows us to create a very optimistic scenario. For reference, YELP's invested capital has grown on average $160 million (29% of 2015 revenue) each year since 2012.Catalyst: YELP Faces Same Risks That Tanked Shares BeforeYELP has proven to be quite the volatile stock, once trading near $100/share in early 2014. We've seen this boom/bust cycle play out at Yelp multiple times, and if history is anything to go by, the story doesn't end well. Shares of YELP have been punished for three distinct reasons in the past.Despite user growth remaining questionable (and slowing), the firm's TTM margins in decline over 2015, and continued heavy spending, investors have chosen to overlook the issues that not only caused shares to drop in the past, but still remain prevalent.As shown above, even in the most optimistic scenarios, the profit growth already baked into YELP remains highly optimistic.With a captive user base that it is unable to monetize enough to break even, Yelp has two choices:In scenario one, the company accrues even greater losses. In scenario two, the company ends the ""growth story"" that investors have bought into during the first half of 2016. Momentum stocks can be great short-term trades when they're on the upswing, but when the fundamentals are revealed, and true value investors see through the unprofitable growth story, the results can be damaging.Insider Action Is Low While Short Interest Is HighOver the past 12 months, 1.5 million insider shares have been purchased and 310 thousand have been sold for a net effect of 1.2 million insider shares purchased. These purchases represent just under 2% of shares outstanding. Additionally, there are 7.5 million shares sold short, or just under 10% of shares outstanding.Impact of Footnotes Adjustments and Forensic AccountingIn order to derive the true recurring cash flows, an accurate invested capital, and a real shareholder value, we made the following adjustments to Yelp's 2015 10-K:Income Statement: We made $28 million of adjustments with a net effect of removing $26 million in non-operating expenses (5% of revenue). We removed $27 million related to non-operating expenses and $1 million related to non-operating income. See all adjustments made to YELP's income statement here.Balance Sheet: We made $651 million of adjustments to calculate invested capital with a net decrease of $81 million. The most notable adjustment was $270 million (38% of net assets) related to operating leases. See all adjustments to YELP's balance sheet here.Valuation: We made $844 million of adjustments with a net effect of decreasing shareholder value by $98 million. One of the notable adjustments was $201 million related to outstanding employee stock options. This adjustment represents 10% of Yelp's market cap.Dangerous Funds That Hold YELPThe following funds receive our Dangerous-or-worse rating and allocate significantly to Yelp.This article was originally published here on August 22, 2016.Disclosure: David Trainer and Kyle Guske II receive no compensation to write about any specific stock, style, or theme."

It swung to a profit after five consecutive quarters of losses.Yelp's FinancialsYelp's second-quarter revenue was $173.4 million, up 30% over the year, beating analyst estimates of $169.8 million. Net income was $0.4 million, or $0.01 per share, surpassing analyst expectations of a loss of $0.07 per share.By segment, local advertising revenue grew 41% to $151.9 million, driven by strength across the local, national and self-serve channels and improved revenue retention. Transactions revenue grew 37% to $15.5 million, and other revenue declined 6% to $6 million.For the third quarter of 2016, net revenue is expected to be in the range of $180-184 million, representing growth of about 27% yoy. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $24 million to $28 million. Analysts expect revenue of $179.6 million.For the full year of 2016, net revenue is expected to be in the range of $700-708 million, representing growth of about 28% yoy. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $100-108 million. Analysts expect full-year revenue of $699.8 million.The company also announced that CRO Jed Nachman, who joined Yelp in 2007, has been appointed as its COO. Geoff Donaker will be retiring from the COO position after 11 years with Yelp, and will continue as a strategic advisor to the company and retain his seat on Yelp's board of directors.Increasing Local Advertising Revenue, but Declining TrafficYelp has phased out its brand advertising solutions and focused on its local advertising solutions, which now account for 87% of the company's revenue. It now has 128,000 local advertising accounts, up 32% over the year. Cumulative reviews grew 30% to 108 million. App Unique Devices grew 27% to 23 million on a monthly average basis.During the quarter, Yelp added five new platform partners to extend its transaction capabilities wherein consumers can transact with over 100,000 local businesses on the Yelp Platform. As a result, total transaction volume through Eat24, Yelp Reservations and Yelp Platform grew 49%.However, the number of people visiting the site over desktop computers has been declining, and mobile traffic is slowing. Average monthly unique visitors from mobile rose just 7%, its slowest ever. Unique mobile users per month grew 27% (versus 32% in 1Q16, 38% in 4Q15, and 51% in 2Q15), and mobile unique visitors grew 12% (versus 14% in 1Q, 19% in 4Q and 22% in 2Q). This slowdown in traffic could be a result of increasing competition from the likes of Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Based on the recent performance, several analysts have increased the price target, and its price target now ranges from $25 to $45. However, analysts are divided on recommendations. Bulls say its valuation is cheap, while bears are concerned about a slowdown in metrics. Analysts at Raymond James, Axiom Capital, and Mizuho Securities USA raised their recommendations to Buy from Neutral. Analysts at Susquehanna Financial reiterated a Neutral rating and UBS reiterated a Sell rating.Yelp's PartnershipsYelp has partnered with and made a small, strategic investment of $8 million in Nowait, a mobile platform that allows restaurants to manage their waitlists. After the integration of Nowait onto Yelp Platform, consumers will be able to view wait times at thousands of restaurants and even add themselves to the waitlists remotely via the Yelp app.In December 2015, Yelp announced that it has ended its partnership with restaurant reservation service OpenTable, which since 2010 allowed users to make OpenTable reservations through Yelp. Analysts say the move underscores the growing rivalry between the two. OpenTable, which was acquired by Priceline (PCLN) in 2014 for $2.6 billion, has expanded its reviews. In 2013, Yelp acquired rival reservation firm SeatMe and launched Yelp Reservations for free. Yelp Reservations now serve 18,000 restaurants, while OpenTable, which has a partnership with Facebook, is used by over 30,000 restaurants. The best outcome for Yelp would be if it were to be acquired by Priceline and combined with OpenTable. However...Following the results, Yelp stock hit a 52-week high of $37.57 and is currently trading at $37.07 with a market cap of $2.83 billion. It hit a 52-week low of $14.53 in February."
3998438,83156,2016-08-10T15:13:05-04:00,"Yelp is up more than 10% after releasing Q2 results.
        It was the second consecutive quarter in which Yelp beat estimates and raised guidance.
        But the story hasn't changed, and investors need to pay attention to core profitability measures, which decreased y/y.","Shares of Yelp (NYSE:YELP) shot up 10.5% to a 52-week high after the company reported a better than expected quarter. It was the second consecutive quarter in which Yelp beat estimates and raised guidance, and the investment community has grown more bullish on the outlook. However after taking a closer look at the results you will find that familiar issues still plague the company, and while we think the stock has potential in the long-term, investors should not expect meaningful improvements in the short-term.Yelp did well in some key metrics during the second quarter. Net revenues increased 30%, driven by 41% growth in local revenue and 37% growth in transaction revenue. The company once again showed strong progress in building key first mover advantages with local businesses in an effort to drive network effects. Reviews increased 30%, app unique devices grew 27%, and local ad accounts grew 32% as the company added 5 new platform partners. Management raised its full year revenue outlook to $700 - $708 million, the midpoint of which equates to 28% growth over last year.The problem is that Yelp is still having trouble turning a profit, as the costs of acquiring customers is eating up a huge chunk of sales. Yelp reported a net profit in the second quarter, which surprised investors, but it didn't have anything to do with improved productivity or lower operating expenses. Sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales increased from 50.8% to 54.4% year-over-year as the company invested heavily in its sales force and increased stock-based compensation (23% in Q2 vs. 21.8% last year). This caused total opex to edge higher y/y on a percentage of sales basis, leading to a higher loss from operations compared to last year (Figure 1). The y/y increase in net income from a $1.3 million loss to earnings of $0.4 million in the latest quarter was the result of a $1.3 million benefit from income taxes compared to last year's $1.7 million income tax expense.Figure 1: Loss From Operations Increases (Line Items as % of Sales)Source: 10-QManagement likes to focus on adjusted EBITDA (Figure 2) to measure profitability, which adds stock based compensation and D&A back to GAAP income. While operating income fell y/y, adjusted EBITDA increased 23.8% in Q2. This metric is misleading because it leaves out stock-based compensation, which is one of Yelp's biggest expenses. Stock-based compensation expense involves estimates, which means it is subject to manipulation. It also allows management to justify the use of ""adjusted EBITDA"" while at the same time paying fewer wages (the higher the amount of pay tied to stock, the lower the wage packet), creating a downward bias in reported workforce costs. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense, but investors should not ignore it because it represents a real cost to shareholders. The dilutive effect of stock-based compensation reduces the value of existing shares, and shares outstanding increased 2.5% y/y due to the exercise of various options and grants. To get a feel for how Yelp is doing from a core profitability standpoint, investors should emphasize operating income rather than net income or adjusted EBITDA.Figure 2: Adjusted EBITDASource: 10-QConclusion:Shares of YELP shot way up after the second quarter, but the increase is not justified when you consider that things haven't really changed. Yes the company added more partners and users to its platform, but it came at the cost of lower operating income, which is the true measure of profitability for YELP. We think Yelp is smart to prioritize customer acquisition and first mover-advantages, which could eventually create a wide moat due to network effects, and the company can always focus on cutting costs later. But investors should not be fooled by the ""improved"" profit metrics put forth by management."
3998515,22148,2016-08-10T17:30:57-04:00,"Yelp beat Q2 estimates as local ad revenue growth continues to shine despite user metric questions.The company has a huge opportunity ahead in local ad spend in the U.S. and over 30 countries.The stock valuation is hardly stretched compared to other sector stocks, suggesting the recent rally has plenty of legs left.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) surged 13% on Q2 earnings as the market continues to make the mistake of focusing on the wrong user metrics. My previous research highlighted the issues with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) attempting to block search traffic going to Yelp.The stock closed at $36.83 on Wednesday and magnitudes above the February lows of $14.53. The key though is that looking at a two-year chart presents a different view of the stock trading at a reasonable valuation considering the Holy Grail opportunity in local ad revenue.The stock was crushed over the last couple of years as investors solely focused on unique visitor metrics. The stalling user growth was always a concern, but Yelp had the workable solution in the mobile app that allowed users to bypass Google searches. Even better, the mobile app provides the Holy Grail of providing local restaurants and stores where the consumer is located based on the phone.While desktop unique visitors and mobile web unique visitors aren't showing much in the way of growth if not declines, app unique devices grew nearly 10% sequentially to a new record 23.0 million devices. The reason this number matters the most is that mobile app users view 10x more pages versus the website users mostly coming from Google searches.Source: Yelp Q216 presentationIn essence, Google is blocking the casual user, but the top customers go directly to the Yelp app to do local searches. These users are the ones that advertisers are dying to reach. Remember that one app user equals multiple consumers in most cases. A mom looking for a restaurant could equal a family of four eating at the local restaurant found via Yelp.As Yelp lists in the investor presentation, a BIA Kelsey report forecasts the U.S. local ad spend to reach $151 billion this year. Yelp doesn't even account for 1% of the ad spend now, providing years of growth opportunities. In addition, this amount excludes an opportunity in the 30 countries the consumer review site has review sites.With the stock surging to nearly $37, the real question now is whether the valuation has gotten ahead of the results. Yelp is now worth roughly $2.8 billion with an enterprise value below $2.5 billion.The stock offers 41% local revenue growth and analyst expectations now approaching revenues of $900 million next year. The end result is that Yelp still trades at forward P/S ratios below a group of stocks like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), LinkedIn (LNKD) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).YELP PS Ratio (Forward 1y) data by YChartsThe most relevant valuations are probably LinkedIn that got the buyout offer at nearly double the multiple of Yelp. As well, the struggling and hated Twitter valuation even exceeds the multiple of Yelp.The key investor takeaway is that the rally only brings the stock back to a typical low-end valuation multiple. The massive opportunity in local ad spending and the growth rate obtained by Yelp suggests the stock should obtain a premium valuation multiple. Based on this analysis, the rally still has plenty of legs."

The SAP AG (NYSE:SAP) agreement follows a 2014 deal with IBM Corp. (NYSE:IBM) through which Big Blue has been reselling iOS hardware and has developed iOS apps for various industries, and a 2015 deal with Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to create a ""fast lane"" for iPhones/iPads on networks using Cisco gear and enable a ""seamless experience"" between iPhones and desk phones in Cisco environments. Apple has also been courting various independent enterprise developers.SAP and Apple will work to enable apps that can leverage the high-speed Hana in-memory database (popular with both many enterprises and independent developers) through SAP's Hana Cloud Platform, as well as access features from core SAP apps running on Hana. Much like IBM, SAP will also be developing iOS apps ""for critical business operations.""EMC/VMware's Pivotal unit raises $253M at a $2.8B valuation - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Ford (NYSE:F), and General Electric (NYSE:GE) took part in the funding round, as did EMC (EMC) and VMware (NYSE:VMW), each of which already had large stakes. Though Pivotal provides a variety of app development and big data/analytics tools and services, Microsoft, Ford, and GE's interest appears to revolve around the Pivotal Cloud Foundry app development (""PaaS"") platform. Microsoft says it wants its Azure cloud platform to be ""the best place to run Java applications using Pivotal Cloud Foundry."" GE notes that Pivotal Cloud Foundry acts as ""the foundation"" for its Predix IoT cloud service platform.EMC has discussed Pivotal IPO plans as far back as 2013, and Re/code reported of a potential early-2016 IPO last November. But with Pivotal still producing a lot of red ink - the company had a Q1 operating loss of $58M on revenue of $83M (+56% Y/Y) - EMC appears to be in no rush to take its spin-off public.Windows 10 active users top 300M; Microsoft shows off mobile ""hover gestures"" - Microsoft's latest Windows 10 user figure is up from 270M in late March and 200M in early January. In terms of adoption by the Windows installed base, Windows 10 (provided as a free upgrade to Windows 7 and 8 users until July 29) seems to be living up to the company's expectations - over 15% of all PCs now run Windows 10, according to NetMarketShare. Unfortunately, free Windows 10 upgrades might also be adding to the PC industry's recent sales woes as consumers/businesses decide they can upgrade their user experience without upgrading their hardware.Microsoft also disclosed over 63B minutes were spent using the Edge browser in March, and that Cortana (baked into Windows 10) has answered over 6B questions. The data obtained from those queries could help make Cortana more competitive with Google Now (baked into Google (GOOG, GOOGL)) Android and Siri (baked into iOS).In other news, Microsoft has shown off Kinect-like gesture technology that allows a phone user to (with the help of sensors) manipulate a screen without touching it. The Verge notes it isn't clear if the solution will be brought to market, given the current state of Microsoft's phone efforts. Licensing it to Apple and Android OEMs could be an option.eBay buys AI startup ExpertMaker - ExpertMaker, which has already been working with eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) for several years, declares its machine learning solutions ""continuously learn from [a company's] data"" to predict actions and personalize content. eBay, whose shopping/product browsing experience still receives its share of criticism, says ExpertMaker will help it ""build a best-in-class product catalog."" VentureBeat notes ExpertMaker could help eBay deliver better search and recommendation algorithms - much of the start-up's work has involved creating intelligent, subject-specific search engines.The acquisition is another example of how investments in machine learning - a part of AI that involves using algorithms that get better at understanding patterns as more data is analyzed - aren't just for the likes of Google and IBM. Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and LinkedIn (LNKD) have also bought start-ups developing machine learning-based services.Alibaba gains after posting mixed results, reporting 41% Chinese marketplace growth; Yahoo also rises - Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) FQ4 (calendar Q1) sales easily beat estimates, as revenue growth improved to 39% from FQ3's 32%. EPS missed, thanks largely to big investments in non-core businesses such as video content/services and the Koubei local services JV with Alipay parent Ant Financial. Koubei, by itself, had a $118M impact on Alibaba's FQ4 bottom line.Driving the sales beat: Chinese marketplace (Taobao/Tmall) revenue rose 41% Y/Y, better than FQ3's 35%. At 24%, marketplace GMV growth was only a little better than FQ3's 23% (rivals such as JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) are growing faster), but Alibaba's GMV monetization rate improved to 2.47% from 2.17% a year ago, with the mobile monetization rate now up to 2.42%. Also: Alibaba's cloud computing/web infrastructure revenue rose 175% to $165M, with the AliCloud infrastructure platform (big in China) now claiming 2.3M users and 500K+ paid customers.Improving mobile monetization has boosted Alibaba's revenue. Source: Earnings slides.As of Thursday's close, Yahoo's (YHOO) M&A drama-filled 384M-share Alibaba stake was officially worth $30.3B. Yahoo's market cap stood at just $35B. There could be a good payoff for shareholders if the company finds a way to tax-efficiently monetize its Alibaba stake.3D Systems slumps after missing sales estimates; gross margin improvement lifts EPS - In March, beaten-down 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD) flew higher after delivering a large Q4 beat. No such luck after the Q1 report, as a revenue miss and a related 9% Y/Y drop in product sales sparked a 6.4% drop on Thursday. 3D printing rival Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) fell 2.7%.As was the case with the Q4 report, 3D, which recently hired former HP printing chief Vyomesh Joshi to be its CEO, didn't provide formal guidance. Like peers, the company has been stung by overcapacity at industrial/prototyping 3D printer clients, even as end-user 3D printing adoption continues growing. On the earnings call, the company mentioned professional printer sales fell 23% and parts manufacturing services revenue fell 15%. Software (sales +22%), production printers (+18%) and healthcare (+12%) were bright spots. A higher gross margin boosted EPS, as did a moderate decline in operating expenses.GoPro drops after mixed results and guidance affirmation; Ambarella ticks higher - The fact that Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA), a video processor developer that gets a large portion of its revenue from GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), rose slightly after-hours even as GoPro fell is telling here. It's not GoPro's sales that are bothering the market at current depressed levels - Q1 revenue beat estimates, 2016 sales guidance was affirmed, and GoPro noted (though camera shipments fell 48% to 701K due to inventory clearing) end-user camera sales were nearly flat Y/Y.Rather, it's the EPS pressure stemming from large gross margin declines (caused by both shipment declines and price cuts) and still-aggressive spending (operating expenses rose 37% Y/Y in spite of job cuts) that are troubling the Street. Also: GoPro has delayed the launch of its Karma drone (once due in 1H16) to the holiday season. That's also when the Hero5 camera line (GoPro's first big refresh since the 2014 holiday season) is due. Q4 will matter even more than usual this year.Square tumbles after beating on revenue, missing on EPS, and hiking 2016 guidance - The profitability concerns that have dogged Square (NYSE:SQ) since pre-IPO times weren't exactly dispelled by the Q1 report. Even if one backs out a $50M litigation accrual, the company saw its operating loss rise slightly Y/Y to $47.1M in spite of 51% revenue growth on the back of 45% payment volume growth. In addition, the gross margin for Square's core payment processing business fell slightly to 35.3%.But there are some reasons to think the margins will begin improving: Operating expense growth (18% on a non-GAAP basis) is slowing, Square's Starbucks business (for which gross margin is close to nothing) will soon end, margin pressure caused by the launch of Square's new card reader (sold at a loss) will diminish, and higher-margin software and data product revenue (fueled by the Square Capital cash advance business and Caviar food delivery service) grew 197% and made up 13% of gross profit.2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance was slightly hiked in spite of the Q1 EPS miss. A 64M-share lockup expiration arrives on May 16.Tableau sells off after reporting beating estimates, reporting major license growth slowdown, and hiking full-year guidance - With shares having been crushed in February following Tableau's (NYSE:DATA) Q4 report, they fell a relatively modest 5.5% after-hours on Thursday after the company reported software license growth (drives future service growth and acts as a proxy for the growth of a company's paid installed base) of 14% Y/Y in Q1, compared with 31% in Q4 and 57% a year ago. Also, $100K+ deals rose by just 8% to 268.Fears about tough competition from a slew of business intelligence/analytics software rivals - Microsoft's Power BI platform (now part of a Cortana Analytics Suite) is mentioned most often, but Qlik (NASDAQ:QLIK) Sense, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) QuickSight, and other offerings also get attention - are bound to persist. As are worries about sales execution - Tableau announced in January long-time sales chief Kelly Wright is retiring, and the company now says it's looking to hire a president to head its go-to-market activities by year's end.Nonetheless, the fact that 2016 sales guidance was slightly hiked suggests Tableau expects some improvement in license growth later this year. EPS guidance, meanwhile, was hiked significantly due to the company cutting its 2016 hiring plans in half. Though Tableau's competitive environment looks tougher than it did 12-18 months ago, its offerings are still often seen as best-in-class in a next-gen BI/analytics space growing quickly as companies look to give office workers something better than Microsoft Excel for deriving insights from business data.Gartner places Tableau in its ""Leaders"" quadrant for the BI/analytics market. But plenty of competition exists.Yelp jumps after mixed Q1 results, solid Q2/2016 guidance - Like Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) and Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), Yelp (NYSE:YELP) dominates an online niche, but has been hurt by concerns about slowing growth, heavy spending/margin pressure, and growing competition. Also, like Zillow and Etsy (both surged post-earnings earlier this week), Yelp's Q1 report could reduce those concerns a bit, even if it won't eliminate them.Local ad revenue rose 40% Y/Y, an improvement from Q4's 35%. Cumulative reviews rose 31% to 102M, local ad accounts rose 34% to 121K, and ""app unique devices"" accessing Yelp rose 32% to 21M/month. In addition, Yelp reports app users were more than 10x as engaged as website users, many of whom come via Google.On the other hand, GAAP sales/marketing spend rose 51% to $95.6M and equaled 60% of revenue - that's a big reason Yelp missed EPS estimates in spite of a revenue beat. Compared with selling ads to Global 2000 companies (as Google and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) often do), selling ads to local businesses typically brings a much lower return per dollar of sales/marketing spend. That was a challenge for Yelp when it went public in 2012, and is still a challenge today. But with the stock trading more than 75% below its 2014 highs, the market appears willing to focus on the Q1 report's positives.Activision gains on Q1 beat and strong Q2 guidance - Full-year guidance is nearly in line. A 41% Y/Y increase in console revenue to $328M (lifted by Call of Duty: Black Ops III) more than offset a 10% drop in PC revenue to $301M. Candy Crush Saga developer King Digital (BATS:KING) contributed $207M following the February closing of Activision's (NASDAQ:ATVI) purchase of the company.Some positive metrics were also reported: Activision and Blizzard brands' online monthly active users (""MAUs"") respectively rose 10% and 23% Y/Y to 55M and 26M, and King's MAUs rose 3% Q/Q to 463M. Without giving a number, Activision states King's gross bookings rose Y/Y. 88% of total revenue came from ""digital online channels.""FireEye falls after posting mixed results, issuing soft sales guidance, and announcing a CEO change - A cybersecurity darling not too long ago, FireEye (NASDAQ:FEYE) has been battered over the last 12 months due to concerns about both sales execution and intensifying competition from the likes of Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW) and Cisco, each of which have been bundling cheaper malware-protection offerings with other security products. FireEye's product (hardware/software) revenue dropped 16% Y/Y in Q1 to $33.7M. Subscription/service revenue, lifted by both organic growth and M&A, rose 58% to $134.3M.Some positives: Q1 billings of $186M (+23% Y/Y) surpassed guidance of $163M-183M, and full-year billings, EPS, and cash flow guidance has been reiterated (but not revenue guidance). On the earnings call, FireEye said its Q1 billings growth was driven by ""cloud-based solutions and especially our threat intelligence and cloud email and our FireEye as a Service capability.""That might provide some context for FireEye's CEO change and broader management shakeup. While its traditional threat-prevention hardware/software business is clearly under pressure, many of the endpoint protection and incident response offerings obtained through FireEye's $1B+ December 2013 acquisition of Mandiant remain strong points for the company. Mandiant founder Kevin Mandia is now FireEye's CEO, and Mandiant president Travis Reese has been named FireEye's president.Arista rises on Q1 beat and strong Q2 guidance - With the help of strong demand from major cloud service providers, Arista's (NYSE:ANET) high-density, low-latency switches continue taking data center switch share. Product revenue rose 33% to $212.5M, and subscription service revenue 57% to $29.7M.On its earnings call, Arista made plenty of references to strong demand from ""cloud titans,"" while also insisting demand from other service providers, tech firms (deploying for internal use), and financial firms was solid. Major customer Facebook recently forecast its 2016 capex will be at the high end of a prior $4B-4.5B guidance range.LinkedIn reportedly working on publishing feature similar to Facebook's Instant Articles - Like Instant Articles, LinkedIn's reported feature would let users read full articles from partners within its own apps, rather than having to go to a publisher site. Publishers would benefit from giving readers a better experience, while LinkedIn would get to keep users on its apps and perhaps use its professional data to deliver targeted ads against the articles.One challenge for LinkedIn: Compared with Facebook, far fewer of the company's users rely on it to consume content, and (for this reason and others) the company's advertising scale is much less than Facebook's. Facebook has convinced many publishers to embrace Instant Articles (in spite of the loss of control it brings) because of its reach and monetization ability. LinkedIn could face a tougher sell.Amazon leases 20 more Boeing 767s - Two months after striking a deal with Air Transport Services to lease 20 Boeing 767s for a U.S. air cargo network, Amazon has inked a deal to lease another 20 from Atlas Air Worldwide. Both deals have included granting Amazon warrants that allow it to obtain substantial minority stakes in the company it's leasing from.Amazon's transportation logistics efforts, of course, go well beyond air freight. Morgan Stanley sums it up: ""AMZN's continued initiatives in the space (which includes purchasing thousands of truck trailers, applying for an ocean freight forwarding license, registering with the SEC as a transportation company together with setting up its own last-mile delivery service in select cities) indicate its seriousness in building out at least the early stages of an end-to-end delivery network… we believe UPS/FDX need to at least keep one eye on the rear view mirror."""
3986073,71075,2016-07-04T04:56:44-04:00,"For the majority of 2015, Yelp struggled to beat expectations.
        Although the company rebuffed all speculation, analysts saw an acquisition as a logical next step.
        However, after reporting Q1 16 earnings, Yelp is beginning to display some of the classic characteristics of a turnaround story.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) provides user reviews and profiles on local businesses in a variety of services, primarily restaurants and home services. The company generates revenue from the sale of advertising on its Website to local businesses and national brands.Since its IPO in 2012, the company has been on a rollercoaster ride. For the majority of 2015, Yelp struggled to beat expectations as it tackled the Google algorithm conflict, a surge in competitors, and slowed local ad revenue growth. The company reported the slowest revenue growth it has had in four years in Q1 2015. It simply seemed that small businesses were not willing to pay for Yelp's advertising, citing low rates of return and expensive advertisement rates.The Possibility of a Takeover?Immediately after the disappointing quarter, rumors that Yelp could be putting itself up for sale swarmed. Although the company rebuffed all speculation, analysts saw an acquisition as a logical next step.Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has historically tried to push its check-in and review system. In addition, the social media giant has made efforts to strengthen its restaurant profiles with menus and is exploring mobile reservations. Yelp would be a natural complement, allowing FB to leverage the mass of user-generated content.Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has also made movest toward food delivery and small businesses. The e-commerce giant launched Amazon Home Services in early 2015, allowing consumers to hire service professionals directly off the site. It currently integrates Yelp reviews.Priceline (PCLN) could also be a viable acquirer as it tries to congregate every aspect of a trip including dining out. The company acquired OpenTable in 2014, a company that competes directly with Yelp's SeatMe reservation service.Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), despite past conflicts, is a possible candidate. In 2009, the search giant actually tried to acquire Yelp for half a billion before falling through. Instead, Google went ahead and acquired Zagat in 2011. Zagat competes directly with Yelp in restaurant reviews and listings.However, as 2016 began to roll around, CEO Jeremy Stoppelman began leading Yelp in the right direction, taking advantage of the company's most valuable asset: its unparalleled list and review archive of small businesses and user generated content. Yelp recently reported 1Q 16, beating estimates of $156mm with quarterly revenue of $158.8mm, notably with local ad revenue growing at 40% YoY. In addition, cumulative reviews grew 31% YoY to almost 102 million total reviews, putting the company over its 100 million review milestone. This positive news led to management raising its revenue guidance for 2016 to $690-$702mm. Although the company is still not profitable, Yelp has continued to display its focus on reaching profitability by reiterating its long term goal of increasing EBITDA margins to 30-40%.A completely different story from the one that the company painted just a year ago, sending the stock soaring afterwards. The highlights of the quarter included strong growth in local ad revenue, positive gains in mobile app usage, and continued growth in customer content and reviews.With Yelp's new product developments and surprising customer acquisition, it is beginning to display some of the classic characteristics of a turnaround story. Although, its first quarter of 2016 showed positive signs, the company will have to continue beating estimates and accelerating its local ad revenue growth campaign to regain the trust of analysts and its own shareholders.What's driving this Yelp turnaround?1. Improvements in the company's sales strategyYelp's ad revenue business model has always been one that it has struggled to ramp up. The local ad revenue segment is especially difficult due to the extremely fragmented market and lack of marketing knowledge of small business owners. As a result, Yelp has invested significantly into its sales team to drive revenue growth.2. Great promise in its platform initiative.Yelp has made great progress with its platform initiative by creating a full ecosystem around more than just reviews and info, adding reservations, ordering with EAT24, and seating with SeatMe. Historically, users of Yelp primarily use the site as a discovery tool and complete the transaction elsewhere. This habit has constrained the company's user retention, return on advertising dollars, and overall user engagement.Through a mixture of acquisitions (EAT24) and product launches (SeatMe), Yelp is slowly building itself into a one-stop shop for consumers. As a result, the added functionality has boosted both the top line as well as margins.3. Taking advantage of consumer trends towards mobileIn Nov. 2015, Google was accused of altering its search results algorithm to purposely place Yelp pages lower on the search results. This certainly posed a significant barrier to Yelp's traffic growth; however, recently Yelp has been taking advantage of consumer trends towards mobile as its desktop views decline and mobile views rise. Searching for Yelp pages on a mobile phone browser will direct users straight to the mobile app if they have it downloaded. This effort to circumvent the company's dependance on Google search could be a possible method of mediating the loss of web traffic. yelp has seen its app downloads continue increasing as it grows its unique devices from 16 million in Q1 15 to 21 million devices in Q1 16. The app also displays stronger customer engagement with app users viewing more than 10 times the number of pages website users do.If Yelp is able to correctly utilize and leverage its incredible wealth of user-generated data and listings, it will maintain its promising ad revenue growth and improving margins. However, if the company is unable to ramp up its mobile end and successfully integrate its platform initiative into a seamless user experience, an acquisition could very much be on the horizon."
3979136,22148,2016-06-01T12:10:34-04:00,"Numbers from Google confirm that Yelp sets to benefit from the convergence of mobile and local.Yelp continues to grow mobile app growth in order to get past the blockades attempted by Google.The stock is no longer extremely cheap, but plenty of upside exists as Yelp grows market share in local business ad spend.","The story for Yelp (NYSE:YELP) for a while now has been the promise of cracking the holy grail of the local-ad market restrained by the algorithm moves of Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google to provide preferential treatment for their own services. Ironically, though, the latest from Google appears to back the promise of Yelp as mobile increasingly becomes focused on local.Yelp has traded solidly over the last few months as decent Q1 results and news of a David Einhorn investment buoyed my view of a game changer for the stock. Now the question is whether the company can make a leap forward, as the recent run up in the stock needs results in order to for further gains.Mobile Is LocalThe recent update to AdWords seems to confirm that Yelp is ideally positioned in the mobile arena to take advantage of local advertising. Not only is Google seeing over 50% of searches as mobile, but also nearly one third of those mobile searches are related to location.Local mobile searches have become so pervasive that Google is even changing ad formats and upgrading mapping functions. Both moves that make finding local services via mobile searches easier.The prime reasons the search giant is changing ad formats is to provide more relevant information optimized for popular smartphone screen sizes to improve the click through rates. As well, the move improves the consumer's experience on a smartphone by reducing the amount of clicking back and forth from websites.Source: Google Adwords blogThese AdWords updates may make it more difficult for Yelp to get good placements on Google searches, but in a roundabout way it confirms that Yelp is focused on the right areas. Most importantly, Yelp can focus on growing the mobile app install base as searches via the app already easily categorize and map applicable results.The key to success for the consumer review site remains the ability to grow the amount of unique devices on the app. For Q1, Yelp had 21.2 million app uniques, up from 16.0 million in the prior-year period. The number was at a new record, up 1.2 million uniques sequentially.More growth in the mobile app moves Yelp away from the issues caused by Google.Local Business OpportunityWhile the battle with Google for consumer queries is never ending, the market for local business advertising dollars is wide open. Despite all the debates and research reports claiming issues with the general reviews on the Yelp platform, local businesses continue to sign up for the service.For Q1, Yelp grew local revenue by 40%. The amount of local advertising accounts grew by 34% to 121 thousand. The key, though, is that the consumer review site has a minimal amount of the advertising spend from local businesses providing plenty of room for growth.According to research by BIA Kelsey summarized in the recent Yelp presentation, the amount of money spent by local businesses on advertising is now over $150 billion.For Q1, Yelp only collected $138.1 million in local ad spend. The other $20.5 million came from transactions and data revenues. Total revenue for the year will approach $700 million, but only something around $600 million is related to local ad dollars. The company won't reach 1% market share until revenues surge to $1.5 billion.TakeawayThe key investor takeaway is that Yelp remains positioned to collect on the growth in localized searches. The stock is no longer as cheap when Yelp traded below $15, but the valuation remains reasonable for a company expecting 25% growth. In fact, the stock will see meaningful upside if Yelp can accelerate the users on the mobile app."
3970873,70965,2016-05-03T18:18:17-04:00,David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital discloses a modest $6 million stake in Yelp.Hardly a concentrated conviction position.We think Yelp is old news and its stock will be soon enough.,"By Scott TzuWith David Einhorn taking a modest stake in Yelp (NYSE:YELP) that represents about 0.1% of his capital, many investors are considering potentially taking a position in the company. We wanted to take a quick look at a few common sense reasons why we don't agree with Mr. Einhorn's stake in YELP, and we also wanted to look at the one bullish catalyst that could be a threat to shorts. We have no position in Yelp, and we think it isn't worth an investment here.First off, we just don't like Yelp on the basis of common sense related to its primary business and other companies' successful endeavors into the same business. Also, many restaurant owners that we have spoken to over the last six months to a year have reiterated their lax attitude on Yelp reviews to us. The potential anonymity of Yelp and its use as a punching bag for hated figures in the media has given owners and customers alike a healthy dose of skepticism when approaching reviews on any particular restaurant.Formerly, Yelp was in a position of power because restaurants would pay it to be able to manage its page, and restaurateurs were extremely interested in the reviews they got and maintaining high ratings. Yelp was the go-to spot on the web to try and get a heads up on a dining establishment. Now, customers share some of the same doubts that owners share; namely that the reliability of reviews are worth reading and that it's information you can't get anywhere else.A couple of negatives for the company have popped up since Yelp's IPO and its meteoric rise and fall.Players like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) have both entered the business of reviews. Now, you can go onto a company's Facebook page and easily check reviews that other people have listed for that business. Along the same lines, you can also get reviews on Google not only restaurants, but also products, services and other miscellaneous items that Yelp has considered branching out into. Between these sites and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which offers reviews on basically every product known to man, online reviews is a crowded space.In crowded spaces, players need to innovate and find segments that they can capitalize on while competitors lag. Yelp has yet to find this ""magic"" that it's going to need to set it apart from other websites that are in the same business.Yelp was intuitive when it first came out. It was a centralized location for restaurant reviews on the web. As time has progressed, however, competitors have worked to make their reviews just as relevant as the ones that are on Yelp.Again, there is even attitude among some restaurant owners that Yelp reviews are laughable and not even worth considering when trying new places. We think that customers will eventually take note of the way that restaurant owners have even made fun of Yelp, like here in these photos.With owners not stressing it and customers perhaps not weighing the site the way they once did, how does Yelp plan on once again re-accelerating its top line? Growth has slowed and Einhorn's hope of continued growing EBITDA is a shaky call at best.We think Yelp is beyond its prime years already and that the once puffed up post-IPO valuation may not rear its head ever again.Mr. Einhorn's Bull Case is Not a Reason to InvestOne of the major positives about Yelp is that it does not have any debt. People are quick to point that out on the balance sheet, and people are also quick to point out that the company is worth about $9 per share on paper. At around $9, perhaps we'd consider a long position. At today's $1.2 billion EV at $22 per share, YELP just simply isn't that attractive to us.Estimates for this year are for a loss of $.24 per share and analyst estimates for next year are for a loss of $.04 per share, according to the average of 28 analysts who cover the company. Estimates for next year have been brought down significantly from the $.20 per-share that was expected about three months ago.For a company this ""early"" in its growth, as analysts want you to believe, de-accelerating revenue and reduced estimates are two big no-no's.The company has still grown its top line over the last four quarters and consistently makes a gross profit that becomes an operating loss once SG&A is accounted for. SG&A costs show no signs of reduction. After a $15.8 million tax liability last quarter, the company posted net income of -$22.2 million. Cash flow has been inconsistent over the ttm period, and the company has yet to show investors that it can consistently generate cash. We ran a number of scenarios calculating the NPV of just the company's CFFO out to 20 years, growing at 5% per annum with modest discount rates. Nothing in that analysis made us think YELP is close to being worth $22.From a valuation perspective, assigning this company a $1.27 billion enterprise value may still be a bit on the steep side.The one thing we will agree with Mr. Einhorn on is the fact that Yelp could eventually get bought out. We could see the company as a supplemental asset to another, larger company. As a reminder, the company has already evaluated its strategic options and tried to sell itself once. Despite the company stating that there was interest, nothing ever progressed.While we think the company could get bought out, we are not sure that it could get bought out at a substantial premium as Mr. Einhorn is suggesting. He suggests a ""bidding war,"" but we believe a sale would more likely be entertaining lowball bids, similar to the way that Yahoo is probably doing, instead of a bidding war that will drive the price up.We think the upside is capped unless something crazy happens to YELP's operations, fundamentals, and cash flow. The risk to the upside is small compared to the potential downside we could see if YELP's core operations continue to show slow-downs.A $1.2 billion enterprise value is still very steep for a company that has decelerating earnings growth, and it has its core business in question by enormous competitors with virtually unlimited resources.While we respect Mr. Einhorn, we think he has this one wrong, and but for a small premium on a potential buyout, that there is no real reason to be in Yelp's stock right now."
3972399,22148,2016-05-06T13:36:33-04:00,Yelp reported Q1 results and provided full-year guidance that easily surpassed analyst estimates.The large stock gains by midday trading appear very sustainable based on a couple of catalysts.The recommendation is to own this stock and use any dips to load up on Yelp.,"As Yelp (NYSE:YELP) headed into the quarterly results, the market clearly had limited expectations for the company. The stock traded at all-time lows in February and ended April below the lows of 2015. Even trading above $25 today, the stock trades 50% below the 52-week highs.click to enlarge)The ironic part of the story was that Yelp was still expected to grow revenues by roughly 25% annually in 2016 and 2017. My previous research highlighted how the company had a couple of catalysts for long-term growth that the market was ignoring. Even after the stock soared some 20% in early trading based on easily beating analyst estimates, one can possibly argue the valuation is not too stretched at these levels.The quarterly news was a game changer for a couple of reasons. First and foremost, Yelp continues to shift away from a reliance on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) search results. My thesis for a long time is that regulators such as the EU Corporate Commission could help alleviate Google pushing Yelp's relevant results down the list in favor of their own, but the company had its own solution. Any investment thesis wouldn't work if Yelp was entirely reliant on regulators.In this regards, Yelp continue making big progress in getting consumers to download the app and immediately bypass searching on Google. Consumers can still go directly to the desktop site directly, but the local benefits of Yelp are enhanced by using the location of the mobile device to find good, local businesses.For the quarter, App Unique Devices grew 32% YoY to 21.2 million. The number hit a new quarterly record and was up sequentially from 20.0 million. Over the last two years, the app user gains over the next two quarters have averaged 4 million per year. A similar growth path would place Yelp at over 25 million App Unique Devices for Q3. As the slide below highlights, these app users are more engaged and valuable than any desktop or Google search users.Source: Yelp Q1'16 presentationThe second game changer was the re-acceleartion of local revenue growth. The reason for the beaten down stock was sentiment that Yelp didn't have a profitable future as big players like Google would continue to crowd out the company. The reality was that Yelp expected to continue growing at a solid clip, but the company accelerated that path with 40% local revenue growth.In the previous couple of quarters, Yelp ""only"" grew local revenue by around 35%. Part of the reason for the slower growth rate was dropping brand ads that slowed down the mobile experience. Dropping those ads hurt revenues in the short term, but set the company up for long-term benefits, as the mobile site became faster and easier to use.With the game changing view that Yelp is moving away from a reliance on Google search results and situated to survive and thrive in the lucrative local advertising market, the stock valuation is extremely cheap even after this rally. In comparison to other stocks like Google, LinkedIn (LNKD), and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Yelp has the cheapest valuation.This chart doesn't capture the gains from today that place the Yelp EV to forward revenues multiple at roughly 2.2x. The multiple suggests the stock is still valued at the low end of the group of stocks.The key investor takeaway is that the Q1 results were a game changer for the market mindset regarding the stock. Yelp is no longer hinged to Google. Under that scenario, the stock is more valuable than 2x revenue estimates."
3968052,70435,2016-04-26T11:41:06-04:00,"Yelp hasn't evolved quickly enough to protect itself from threats from Facebook, Google and others.The company has had to drastically increase expenses to stay relevant.Only one profitable year in the last five.","One of the problems facing companies operating in the online technology space is the pace at which these businesses evolve and the swiftness from which they transition from high growth companies to mature entities. Notwithstanding the obvious competitive elements and threats of new technology relegating formerly successful ideas to the waste bin of history, once companies show an inability to innovate further, time is not on their side. Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is a strong case of this specific phenomenon after successfully operating within a space, but is now facing increasing inescapable threats from other platforms such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).While Yelp has managed to continuously grow revenues, which is a positive from an investor's standpoint, it does not mitigate the fact that the company has had to embark on a massive spending spree to accomplish this feat. With spending outpacing revenues by a wide margin it is not hard to tell why Yelp shares have been beaten up over the first quarter and will likely continue to tumble in the coming quarters. Now that credibility problems are creeping up and user growth is starting to falter, the future for shareholders may not be as bright as Yelp guidance suggests.Competition and CredibilityAlthough the application has helped Yelp gain greater traction over the years thanks to the ability to bypass Google, a quick look at its mobile application side-by-side with a Google search underlines a critical issue. Yelp is a cluttered application that lacks authenticity and credibility. While Google immediately gives users a number of helpful starting points such as a map, a link to the website, prices, reviews, and a button to call the business, Yelp's review of business starts off with a button to add a review. Should Facebook add a platform that can review businesses and services, Yelp is unlikely to be able to recover from another form of competition that has endlessly deep pockets.Based on the way that Yelp operates, there is substantial room for abuse and manipulation. Businesses have been accused of posting a fake review of its services in a bid to increase its rating, raising the issue of credibility. While consumers increasing consult the web for helpful feedback on a variety of different areas of businesses and services, they are increasingly reverting to word of mouth advertising, an area where Facebook trumps Yelp. Additionally, consumers seeking credibility will look towards more helpful review sites dedicated to the subject. One such example would be consumers choosing OpenTable over Yelp to find a helpful restaurant review and book a table. An equally unnerving trend is falling monthly users both on desktops and mobile, and indication that suggests its influence is waning.Do Eyeballs Matter?Even though monthly visitors have climbed over the years, the explosive growth metrics of years earlier have tapered dramatically, evidence of a rapidly maturing entity. If eyeballs do matter, then falling visitors should be a worrying sign for any investors betting on user growth to translate to revenue growth. For an online entity such as Yelp, advertising and affiliate revenue are the only sources of monetization. Therefore, growing the number of users and page visits is the only real way to grow revenues over time, raising the question of how much the company will have to spend to achieve those results. According to the most recent statistics posted by the company itself, average monthly viewers have fallen to 86 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, signs of growing exhaustion.For most e-commerce giants, eyeballs are the equivalent of cash. However, the one obvious flaw to this ideology is the fact that eyeballs do not matter if they fail to convert. Thankfully, Yelp's model is not as flawed as social media giants. However, in the case of Yelp, despite the sheer number of eyeballs and pinpointed advertising thanks to a strong understanding of what users are looking for, Yelp actually has a chance. The one item that continues to be a serious drag unfortunately is the inability for monetization to keep pace with surging costs.One Profitable Year in the Last FiveWhile easy to cite the long-term view and potential of the company as a rationale to buy now when share prices are not far from record lows, the question is whether or not the company represents value at current levels. Truth be told, and looking at the breakdown of the financials, the evidence is not sufficient to suggest value at these levels. The company continues to lose money as evidenced by earnings per share of -$0.44 in the fourth quarter with current estimates forecasting further losses in the first quarter of 2016. Even doing quick back of the envelope math suggests the company is overvalued. Tangible book value of $6.35 per share suggests that the company has a long way to fall should equity investors become dismayed by Yelp's progress.Just a quick gander at Yelp's income statement for the last five years should be enough to dissuade investors from betting on the short-term viability of Yelp. Since its initial public offering at $15 per share and opening trade at $22.01 per trade, Yelp has effectively returned nothing to shareholders. For a high-growth reviews site, this has been a bad deal for investors and the exodus of a top executive does not necessarily add to confidence going forward. The abrupt resignation of Chief Financial Rob Krolik raises serious questions about Yelp's viability to retain key staff amid its charge towards a 2017 revenue target of $1 billion.The fact is, revenues are growing at a reduced paced of 45.60% in 2015 while cost of goods sold has grown by 92.08% year over year, a trend that is not sustainable if Yelp ever hopes to go ahead and deliver any form of shareholder value. Even expanding the sales force to contribute to the top line is a worrying element, considering that sales expenses have risen by over 50% a year since 2011. Aside from the fact that Yelp has only turned a profit once in the last five years (2014 saw net income of $36,473,000), rising costs and reduced margins means even less upside for investors over the medium-term. Investors are not wholly impressed as evidenced by the high short interest, which currently stands at 12.75% (as of March 31st).The one bright spot from the perspective of the financials is the $370.83 million in cash compared to the outstanding liabilities of $61.81 million. If the company can continue to generate higher revenues year over year, this might lend itself to a slightly higher valuation from these levels, but that should not necessarily be viewed as a point of optimism.Going ForwardAfter a disastrous share performance of -57.48% over the last 52 weeks, finding the silver lining in Yelp's competitive landscape or financials is especially challenging. Although certain analysts are keen to talk about expanding advertising revenues, the question is whether or not Yelp can control costs to preserve margins. At present, based on the fact that expenses are surging while revenue growth is tapering, the company will be forced to find a new way to drive growth, especially if monthly users continue to fall. While off of 52-week lows at $14.54, Yelp shares remain deeply entrenched in a bear market. Even if the company can begin delivering positive earnings, generating positive shareholder value is not imminent, keeping the shares under pressure at least over the short-to-medium term."

Shares where then trading at $65.","The news that David Einhorn bought 380,000 shares of Yelp Inc. (NYSE:YELP) prompted me to write this quick update to my original piece: Yelp Inc.: In A State Of Cognitive Dissonance, published June 6, 2014. In that piece, I strongly argued that investors should sell their shares of Yelp.Incidentally, Yelp shares were then trading changes hands at $65. Before readers get excited about the David Einhorn news, keep in mind that there are 76 million fully diluted shares outstanding of Yelp, so Greenlight Capital's purchase represents a one half of one percent ownership stake. Moreover, as of Yelp's May 2, 2016, closing price, Mr. Einhorn's stake is worth $8.2 million. Despite Mr. Einhorn's poor 2015 performance, where he lost his investors 20%, this stake is meaningless in the context of an $8 billion hedge fund.June 6, 2014 price history (from Yahoo Finance)I strongly suggest that readers ignore Mr. Einhorn's purchase and do their own due diligence to justify buying shares of Yelp. After all, Yelp's stock was propped up by the likes of Jim Cramer and Wall Street, yet it has woefully underperformed lofty expectations and failed to justify its stretched valuation.What really bothers me the most is that insiders like Jeremy Stoppelman and Max Levchin took advantage of the excesses of capitalism and opportunistically sold lots of stock to momentum investors. Utilizing website insidertrading.org, I calculate that Mr. Stoppelman sold at least $85 million worth of Yelp stock since its IPO at an average price of roughly $47 and Mr. Levchin sold $81 million worth of stock at an average price of $44. Now, I don't have the intellectual curiosity to delve into whether this pair have granted themselves additional options or whether they are now simply converting their remaining Class B shares into Class A so they could raise funds to make this month's rent payments.Per Bloomberg: Greenlight Capital's FY2015 performance.Although I'm no longer close to the Yelp story, I find it interesting that in early May of last year management announced they were putting themselves up for sale. Two short months later they changed their mind and short squeeze induced rally fizzled.Here is some business new prior to Yelp's IPO.As for living up to the Wall Street hype, Yelp has yet to deliver on its much hyped story. Cash flow from operations has been uninspiring despite a 45% jump in FY15 revenue. This is an indictment on Yelp's weak business model.Finally, and hopefully everyone knows this by now, the great Jim Cramer is all about ratings and momentum stocks. It would make for a great PhD thesis to scientifically determine if on balance if Mr. Cramer has helped or hurt investors. I for one don't have the empirical data or time to fairly investigate Mr. Cramer's record, but I know he flip flops like a politician depending on the direction of the winds.As for Yelp, the body of evidence suggests that its robust growth rates are a distant memory. In the absence of this growth, the weight of its overvaluation has revealed itself. Unless you have invested the time and have a compelling reason for owning Yelp, I would continue to avoid the name.Jim Cramer touting Yelp circa April 2014"
3972194,40561,2016-05-06T02:17:55-04:00,"Since David Einhorn announced he was long Yelp, there's been a renewed interest in the company's potential and valuation.Following strong Q1 earnings, investors may be even more convinced by his thesis.Yet even with the outlook seeming bright, investors should be aware of the numerous competitive pressures and risks Yelp faces.Unless there's a near-term sale of the company, Yelp faces the risk of becoming obsolete as competitors such as Google and Facebook may be better positioned.","To be frank, I use Yelp (NYSE:YELP) all the time. Whenever I'm looking for a business or restaurant review, I always seem to end up on Yelp. Then again, I always used to use MapQuest as well until Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) swooped in and took over the space. While I partially agree with David Einhorn that Yelp is impressive and quite dominant because of its massive database of reviews, I'm not sure how long that will last as competitors like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google gain ground.First Quarter EarningsThe Middleman ProblemWhen you want look up a review for a business or restaurant, do you 'Yelp' it or 'Google' it? I can pretty confidently say that most people will head to Google first, THEN click on the link to a Yelp review. That's the key problem with Yelp's business model. Most users don't start out at Yelp. Google is the real middleman here.Notice Google Reviews starting to pop up more and more when you do a search? Why bother with Yelp if Google already has the results you need? As Google begins to generate a bigger and bigger base of reviews, users won't need Yelp any more. Yelp could go the way of MapQuest, and end up an afterthought.Google is not the only threat to Yelp. Facebook could become just as dominant too. More and more businesses are starting to promote their businesses on Facebook. At the same time, advertising spend has taken off at Facebook and it has proven quite effective. Facebook can offer companies and advertisers much more than someone like Yelp can. The key is that Google and Facebook are PLATFORMS. Yelp is just a website. I believe it's only a matter of time before Facebook or Google's reviews database is just as competitive as Yelp's.Find a Buyer While You CanYelp's main advantage now is that they do have the most dominant source of reviews. They've got a nice head start on their database of reviews, along with a base of users that are pretty familiar with using Yelp's platform. Then again, users are just as familiar with using Facebook and Google. Facebook and Google just haven't caught up... yet.Einhorn is probably right when he say's there would be a bidding war for Yelp if it was put up for auction. Someone like Google or Facebook could easily just roll Yelp into their platform, further bolstering their database of reviews. The question is for how much?ValuationEinhorn seemed pretty convinced that Yelp could hit $300mm of EBITDA by 2019. I would have to think he's adding back stock-based comp, seeing as Yelp's true projected EBITDA for 2016 would only be $9 to $18mm if they didn't add back their ridiculous amount of stock comp. If we assume they hit that $300mm mark in 2019 and $150mm of that is stock comp, the company's real EBITDA would only be $150mm, placing a 9x EV/EBITDA multiple on the company. That may look 'low' to you, but remember this is a 2019 estimate, and the acquirer will most certainly be paying that massive stock comp expense if they buy Yelp.I'm not one to make a bet on companies solely based off of a potential future acquisition, especially when its valuation would be based off a dramatically larger 3-year EBITDA estimate.ConclusionI'm a bit too skeptical on Yelp's long-term prospects to get comfortable with an investment here. More importantly, the valuation just seems a bit too ludicrous with such a ridiculous amount of stock comp representing the company's 'adjusted' EBITDA. While the quarter looked good, I wonder how many more quarters the company will have before Google and Facebook start eating their lunch."

Even the early release of solid quarterly numbers hasn't helped alleviate the carnage in the stock.The stock now trades around $16 after trading above $100 a few years back. Based on the current enterprise value and the guidance for ongoing growth, one has to wonder if the stock isn't now reaching a similar inflection point on the downside.Early Earnings ReleaseWith the stock down roughly 12% in mid-day trading, the Q4 results were released early. Yelp blames a PR issue, but either way one has to wonder if the company wasn't dying to get the numbers out early.For the quarter, Yelp reported an EPS of $0.11 that easily smashed the expected loss. Most importantly, the consumer review site provided solid Q1 and 2016 guidance. The market wants to focus on user growth, but Yelp continues to drive revenue growth that reached 40% for Q4.The most important metric now is the amount of unique app devices that grew 38% over the prior-year period. Though Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) continues to direct search traffic towards internal consumer reveiw services, the mobile app is the best method for Yelp to overcome the attempted blocks. For Q4, the company is showing that the app users are 10x more engaged as website users.The good news is that Yelp has a sustainable business that doesn't need traffic from Google.Value, Value, ValueNot surprising for a stock that is down roughly 85% from the peak about two years ago, the stock offers value. At current prices, Yelp has an enterprise value below $900 million. The company has roughly $370 million in cash and marketable securities. The consumer review site even generated $3.8 million in cash from operations.The guidance is for revenues reaching $700 million in 2016. The stock now trades near the 1x sales levels despite having a growth forecast of 26% for the year.In comparison to LinkedIn after the big sell off and the likes of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Yelp is extremely cheap and trading at valuations far below the other stocks.YELP EV to Revenues (Forward) data by YChartsBased on these numbers, Yelp needs to nearly double the enterprise value in order to match the valuation multiples of both LinkedIn and Twitter.TakeawayClearly, any stock such as Yelp can trade lower. At the current valuation and based on solid revenue growth, the stock is extremely cheap. The company will continue to face a struggle with Google, but the valuation for the stock will build as Yelp increasingly utilizes the mobile app to bypass the Internet search giant."

However, over the past few weeks, the stock has outperformed the market as it has rebounded from the 52-week low of $20.50. While the recent return on S&P has been 8%, Yelp's stock has grown by 24%. We estimate that with the existing growth rate and revenue run rate, the stock is fairly valued at $30.02. In this note, we explore the base, bull and bear case for the company. A summary of this is as follows:The Base CaseIn the base case scenario, Trefis estimates that Yelp's stock is worth $30.02. While its local advertising business contributes 73% to the price estimate, Yelp's brand advertising and deals division makes up 6.3% of the estimated value, with cash accounting for the rest.The key drivers for the local ads division are average revenue per active advertising local business account and the number of advertising local business accounts listed with Yelp. The company has a total addressable market (TAM) of 76 million local businesses in the world, of which 53 million are present in the Americas and Europe. This translates into a global market of nearly $130 billion. However, the number of active businesses, which pay for Yelp's services, listed with the company is just a fraction of this market at 104,200 in Q3 2015. Trefis believes that the active advertising business will grow to 359,390 or 4.5% of 7.98 million claimed businesses by 2022. Furthermore, average revenue per active local business (ARPALB), which measures the monetization rate of a city or region, would grow to $4,670.Yelp continues to expand its portfolio through acquisitions such as SeatMe and services through facilities such as Call to Action, which lets a user place an order from Yelp's platform. We believe that, as more businesses are added to Yelp's platform, these services will have an additive and network effect on deal division revenues, which will increase from $23.92 million to $144.92 million by 2022.The Bull Case: Stock Price Improves By 60%In the bull case scenario, we estimate that Yelp's recent expansion into international markets, coupled with the continuous recruitment drive to persuade more businesses to join advertising services, can help the company to improve the share in claimed businesses from 4.5% to 5.0% by 2022. This would translate into 480,500 advertising businesses for local ads division. Trefis also estimates that the ARPALB for the bull case scenario can improve to $5,449 by 2022 as cohort maturity plays an important part in improving monetization rate.Furthermore, initiatives such as Call to Action and the assimilation of acquired delivery services into its platform together can help the company to achieve an improvement in its deals division revenues to $236 million by 2022. However, brand advertising revenue will continue to grow at the base-case rate as competition from other online companies should restrict the ARPU growth rate. Trefis estimates that if the bull case scenario were to pan out, its stock price estimate for Yelp can increase by 60% to $48.09.The Bear Case: Stock Price Declines By 40%In the bear case scenario, on the other hand, we estimate that intense competition would prevent the conversion from claimed businesses, which would also decline, to advertising business. As a result, the share in claimed businesses can decline from 4.5% to 3.89% by 2022. This would translate into 226,390 advertising businesses for local ads division. Furthermore, as the company is currently expanding into new geographies, the monetization rate can be negatively impacted. We estimate that the ARPALB for the bear case scenario can decline to $3,884 by 2022.Furthermore, the bear case foresees lower growth from initiatives such as Call to Action and the assimilation of acquired delivery services (SeatMe, Eat24) into the platform. Thus, improvement in its deals division revenues grows at a slower rate to $76.6 million by 2022. Given these factors, the bear case stock price estimate for Yelp will decline by 40% to $18.51.At present, we have a $30.02 price estimate on Yelp, which is in line with the current market price.Disclosure: No positions."
3966211,22148,2016-04-19T09:32:17-04:00,"Yelp remains an attractively priced stock as the market got too negative on its prospects.The EU could sanction Google, and that might provide relief for Yelp.The recommendation is to own the stock as international remains a greenfield with any growth providing upside to Yelp.","For a long time, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) has struggled to gain traction in international markets as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) utilizes search and the mobile operating system to steer users toward Google reviews. The latest news continues to suggest the EU squeezing Google to open up their networks.Yelp has rallied to $21 after dipping below $15 in February. The stock still trades far below where Yelp started the year. Is it possible that any EU sanctions on Google are only a catalyst and not a requirement for the consumer reviews company to thrive?EU SanctionsAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the EU competition chief is set to charge Google over deals where the Internet search and mobile operating system leader steers users toward their own apps. Apparently, the company requires Android smartphone and tablet makers to pre-install a group of 11 apps that includes search.The news is a good sign that the EU plans to keep Google in check and allow alternatives into the market, but this item focuses more on the mobile platform and not the Internet search case started roughly the same time last year. The antitrust chief though did address the prime issue impacting Yelp. Ms. Vestager made the following statement regarding online shopping results:Unfortunately, a large monetary fine and future changes to practices won't help Yelp in the short term, if ever. The best option remains getting consumers to download the mobile app to directly bypass Google. Besides, Yelp data shows that app users are approximately 10x more active anyway.International ImpactThe impact has been large over the last couple of years and is most visible in the International Unique Visitors (IUVs) totals that have stalled since Q114. Google has effectively limited the growth of users by reducing the visibility of search results for Yelp. The consumer review company reported that IUVs dropped to 29.9 million users in Q415, down from 31.1 million visitors almost two years prior.The number is even more concerning considering Yelp has added the following countries during that time period:During the last two years, the amount of IUVs per country has declined from 1.3 million to now less than 1.0 million. All the while, the markets should be maturing as Yelp hasn't opened new locations in the last two quarters of 2015.While the visitors aren't growing, the number of international reviews continues to surge. Yelp ended 2015 with 10.1 million cumulative reviews for locations outside the U.S., up from only 6.2 million when the user base stalled. As the review totals grow, the company can start monetizing these International locations similar to the U.S. that had a roughly five-year head start.Source: Yelp Q415 presentationA big catalyst remains growing the international revenue bucket that stalled at roughly $3.0 per quarter recently. Remember domestic local revenue is already at $115.9 million. The Philadelphia case study provides an example of how revenues take time to build momentum. For 2015 alone, this U.S. market equaled roughly 50% of the total International revenue for over 30 countries.Source: Yelp Q415 presentationTakeawayThe EU isn't likely to provide any help for Yelp, but the competition commission could always make a move that provides a catalyst. The key takeaway, though, is that the U.S. business alone is worth the current enterprise value of around $1.2 billion, as total revenue is set to reach revenues of $700 million this year. The international market remains a big catalyst for the stock, assuming Yelp can gain user and revenues traction despite high engagement from existing users.The stock faces many headwinds, but Yelp has several catalysts for growth, including the mobile app and more visibility in international search results if the EU acts."
3625316,67123,2015-11-29T08:28:59-05:00,"YELP stock remains undervalued and could be a takeover target at this low valuation. It is my mid-cap contest pick.The YELP app is the standard for free mobile phone local business searches and is essential for competitive businesses to have an accurate profile with a high rating.GOOG and YELP would benefit from synergy of YELP-type results resulting from a Google search, but so would AMZN.The moat is beginning for YELP considering the depth of users, and continued organic growth. YELP would be a great takeover target for a much larger platform.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is the standard in local business search and ratings for mobile users that is starting to build a moat, which makes it my pick for mid-cap stock contest long idea. Growth is impressive as recent earnings beat analyst estimates and the stock remains at a reasonable level ($22.80 per share in after hours trading). The stock is undervalued considerably given the current organic growth in both users and businesses and the amazing growth potential for in-app transactions. The current valuation, which has fallen from insanely lofty levels that occurred throughout 2014, leaves YELP an appetizing takeover target for much larger companies trying to break into the market, such as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Synergies with either company would be lucrative for YELP and shareholders.Building a MoatYELP has a 30% reach among all smartphone users and use of the mobile app makes up 70% of the use of YELP services, which is dominating, but also leaves room for growth. I personally check YELP reviews when searching for local services such as plumbers and car mechanics, and I take them very seriously. The best part is that the service is free for users, and it is really easy for me to understand the value to both me as a user and to the business that I spend my money at. This is in stark contrast to Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI) where you have to pay for a membership, which I believe is no longer a competitive model and doesn't provide any additional value for to the user for the cost. (Side note: shorting ANGI may be a good investment now as well.)YELP makes money selling advertisements and now has in-app transactions from recent purchases of Eat24 and SeatMe and other efforts. The number of in-app transactions has grown 170% Y/Y. YELP's growth in users (which has led to a 40% growth in revenue Y/Y) is completely organic because of the attraction to the vast network of local business services that has been created over the years. Small tweaks such as the recent request-a-quote button are becoming beneficial for businesses to get local leads that are actually being converted to sales, and were said by management to raise leads by 200% for those who installed the new button. The moat seems to be building itself based on the sheer convenience of having access to local business information from mobile devices, and the ability to compare and contrast local options. This is not a network that would be recreated easily and it will be hard to convince all the loyal users and businesses to go elsewhere after creating such in-depth profiles.Selling ItselfRecent rumors suggest that YELP was entertaining the idea of selling itself in July of 2015, but backed off at that time. However, recent moves by Alphabet and Facebook, and even Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) have shown that much larger players are interested in the space, which also legitimizes the growth potential for YELP and the company's direction. YELP remains one step ahead of any newcomers, but would have amazing synergy with any of these larger players because it would instantly tap all of those local businesses into a much larger consumer base. Imagine doing a Google search for a maid near your house and a YELP-like results page came up that allowed you to contact those closest to you and even schedule them online. That would be the ultimate in convenience. Just think if you could order a specialty birthday cake online from a local bakery using Amazon Home Services with free shipping for Prime members. YELP's focus on local business services would give either company an edge in breaking into those smaller retailers' advertising dollars.ConclusionYELP stock's recent fall has left it at an appetizing value to shareholders given the recent earning beat, the high growth expectations, and its amazing ability to grow both users and advertisers organically. This also makes YELP a takeover target for larger companies that would benefit from the synergies created in local business advertising and services. I believe that YELP is destined for continued rapid growth and the potential for adding more in-app transactions could be very lucrative to the company and for business advertising on YELP. As YELP builds its moat in the local business advertising and services industry, I suggest you buy your stake in the company now before it is either bought by a much larger company, or before YELP grows large enough to compete with those companies."
3714176,22148,2015-11-25T14:35:27-05:00,Yelp continues running into search engine issues with Google.The stock has surged this month to top $30.The mobile app continues to offer a long-term solution to the Google problem that makes Yelp a long-term investment when the stock cools off.,"After another search results issue with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is firmly on a path to work on solutions to bypass the Internet search giant. Mobile appears the easy and quick solution, though uptake remains muted.The stock has surged during November with Yelp now trading over $30. Should investors use this opportunity to exit the consumer review stock now?Google ProblemThe Google problem is nothing new and pretty much understood by the stock market. Over the weekend though, the relationship took a turn for the worse. Executives from Yelp, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) and other services took to Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) to complain about the search results.Due to what Google termed as a coding error, search results for services with the company's specific name in the criteria were automatically listing results for Google instead. This tweet from the Twitter account of CEO Jeremy Stoppelman of Yelp summarized the issue perfectly:Google has fixed the problem now and claims that a code issue caused the problem. Regardless, it doesn't solve the problem that if somebody searches for the San Francisco restaurant that the results return the website to the service followed by Google review information. Results for Yelp don't show up until the middle of the page. This issue only surrounded actually searching for Yelp or TripAdvisor.The difference for consumers is that Google has 251 reviews for the Ozumo restaurant in San Francisco while Yelp offers 1,729 reviews. Yelp clearly offers the more desired and used service, but Google has the access to the uninformed consumer.Mobile SolutionThe solution for Yelp for a long time has been the mobile app. By getting consumers to download and use the app, Yelp bypasses the need to search on Google or any other search engine. The problem though is that the company hasn't spent enough marketing the app and had limited penetration to start the year.The company ended 2014 with over 135 million unique visitors, but the amount of unique mobile devices using the app was only 15 million. Yelp ramped up marketing on the app during the summer months and has added roughly 2 million unique visitors per quarter this year to reach 20 million for Q3.Source: Yelp Q3'15 data sheetYelp is still very reliant on Google and other search engines with the amount of unique mobile visitors at over 89 million. The vast amount of users are still finding the consumer review service via another source instead of going directly to the app, which is something I did nearly two years ago.The hope remains for mobile that now accounts for 71% of searches and 75% of engagement on the Yelp platform. The search is so easy to complete on a mobile phone that a desktop computer isn't an advantage, especially for somebody out on town looking for a restaurant or specific type of store.TakeawayThe key takeaway is that Yelp is a growing and thriving service with a potential to rid itself of the Google problem that is slowing growth. Yelp got too cheap when the stock traded down to nearly $20 in early October. At the current $30 price, it is no longer a huge bargain, but the stock remains relatively affordable at roughly 3.3x 2016 revenues. Despite the best attempts of Google to block consumer access to the site, users ultimately have ways of finding Yelp.The recommendation is for investors to not chase the stock at this level. The key is to wait for another dip to start buying the stock."

It was during this meeting that he got passed a message from his assistant saying that Steve Jobs was on the line. Obviously, this would be a monumental event in any young entrepreneur's life. But it was particularly special for Stoppelman, as he always looked up to the titans of the tech world such as Michael Dell, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc. So having Jobs calling him up, and waiting on hold for Stoppelman to answer, was a very exciting and very nerve-racking experience. Stoppelman immediately ran out of the meeting and got the call transferred to his cell phone. Steve Jobs' assistant was actually on the other end of the line, and she said to Stoppelman: ""one moment please."" After holding for 5 minutes, Jobs came on the line and proceeded to tell Stoppelman that he was a Yelp fan, and they were building a great company, and they had a great product, and they should remain independent and he didn't want to see Yelp get bought out, in particular by Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG).Yelp had just received a reported $500 million takeover offer from Alphabet, and rumor has it Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) offered even more than that. But Stoppelman decided that it was best to arrange for independent financing and go solo instead, as it wasn't about the money, it was about building the business. Of course, Jobs at the time didn't know that was the route Yelp had decided to take, or that Stoppelman was in a meeting discussing the company going this direction. But clearly Jobs saw the value of Yelp and the obvious ""It factor"" that the company had.As soon as Yelp came out with an app, Steve Jobs loved it. He was very vocal about his affinity for it as well, proclaiming you didn't need to search anymore on a phone, you could just turn to Yelp for local search. On Thursday, April 8, 2010, during his keynote speech at an Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) event in Cupertino, CA, Jobs said:Fast forward to today, and Yelp is being viewed by many investors as an internet company that is in some sort of ""death spiral."" The stock has plummeted from $100 a year-and-a-half ago, to the low $20s today. It seems like Yelp is the punching bag of 2015, much like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were in 2012. Look how that turned out for investors who bet against those companies at the time.YELP data by YChartsWas Jobs wrong with his assessment of Yelp? No, as Yelp has only gotten better over the last 5 years. Growth has exploded and its app is becoming ever more popular by the day. The problem is profits are elusive, and that always brings out the naysayers. But there is no fundamental flaw in the product or service that Yelp delivers. Rather, there were a few executional issues at the company over the last year or so, as well as increased expenses on marketing and sales. It was these events that have resulted in lower EBITDA for Yelp.There was very little value in Yelp at a share price of $100 and a market cap of over $7 billion. But now at $24 and change, and a $1.8 billion market cap, there is a tremendous amount. It's one of the most undervalued mid-cap stocks at the moment. And if you have a product or service that people want, one that is better than the competition, then profits will come. Below is my review of the company.Yelp's Website, App, And User Experience - 5 StarsYelp's mission is to connect people with great local businesses, that is achieved by having users rate/review these companies on Yelp's website. The model itself has been a huge success, as many local businesses in the U.S. receive tons of customers from Yelp. Some claim that 70% of their revenue is derived from the site.The site has pages devoted to individual business locations, and Yelp users can submit a review of the products/services offered by that business, as well as share their overall customer experience. In addition to writing a review (which could be from as little as a sentence, to a lengthy, in-depth, multi-paragraph description), users assign a rating to the business using a one to five star rating system.Looking for a great steakhouse in New York City, or an Italian restaurant in Akron, Ohio? Go to Yelp, do a search in your area of interest, and you get a list of all businesses in that category that have been reviewed. If you see an option that looks good to you, click on the link and you are taken to that local business's Yelp page which shows all of the individual reviews. But each page is much more comprehensive than that, as it contains photos that users have uploaded, the contact information of the business, hours of operation, a map of the location, and other useful information.I use Yelp all the time, mostly to check out reviews on local restaurants. I find not only the reviews incredibly useful, but also the user photos. When you are in a restaurant ordering from the menu, most of the time you don't know what the dish looks like before you order it. Fortunately, Yelpers upload pictures of various dishes from these restaurants they are reviewing, so oftentimes you can ""see what you get"" before you buy. And when you have a photo of what looks like the ultimate piece of chocolate cake, or a deliciously looking plate of pasta, it's a great marketing tool for restaurants. If the food looks amazing, and the reviews are good, that restaurant is going to be on my list of places to eat.But the site is much more expansive than just restaurants, as users are reviewing just about every type of local business out there - from shopping and beauty, to plumbers and electricians.Many question the accuracy of Yelp's user ratings (particularly for restaurants), as some have a hard time believing that amateurs can do the job of the professionals. These people think reviewers on Yelp are ""unsophisticated, cheap and obsessed with trivial details of the restaurant experience."" A ridiculous and short-sided argument in my opinion.Before Yelp, you only had the ""professional critic."" The vast majority of businesses didn't get any exposure at all until published crowd-sourced reviews on local businesses became popular. And most of these restaurants and other businesses had kind of a one-shot deal, meaning one review and you either did good or didn't. An off day could crush you and your business. Did 1,000 professional critics ever review a single restaurant in some small size city in the U.S.? No, but users on Yelp have.Nate Silver of FiveThirtyEight.com did a study on Yelp and the Michelin Guide, which is a company with a 115-year-old history of ""professional critics."" Michelin reviewers are accused of being ""pretentious and out of touch and of enforcing a rigid view of dining that's biased against certain cuisines.""Nate compared the top 102 rated restaurants in New York City according to the Michelin Guide's 2015 ratings, and then compared each restaurant on Michelin's list to the rating they received on Yelp. Not surprising to me, the reviews of ""amateurs"" on Yelp were in line with the reviews of the professionals of the Michelin Guide. The restaurants with 3 Michelin Stars (the highest rating they give out), received on average just over 4.5 stars (out of 5) on Yelp. The fewer the Michelin stars, the lower the ratings on Yelp as well. For the complete list and more detailed discussion, you can read the story here.(Source: FiveThirtyEight.com)The bottom line is the ratings on Yelp are highly accurate, at least for the local businesses that have more than just a handful of reviews. I myself find Yelp reviewers to be spot on. I always stick with 4-5 star rated restaurants on the site, and I must say that I have never really had a bad experience at a dining establishment using this criteria. That doesn't mean that some lower rated places aren't good, but Yelpers do a great job of filtering out the bad ones. In fact:There are two reasons why Yelp reviews are so accurate. One, is the amount of reviews that are posted on Yelp is very impressive, obviously the more test subjects you have, the higher the accuracy of the results are going to be. And two, Yelp has a sophisticated filtering software that weeds out the fake reviews or highly suspicious ones. If you are a local business, you wouldn't want this to show up on your Yelp page. And this message stays up for 90 days.(Source: Yelp)You would probably be surprised at the number of small business owners that have tried to create several new consumer accounts on Yelp, and they proceed to write a five-star business review of their own business and a one-star review of their competitor. Yelp catches all of this nefarious activity, as fraud detection is of huge importance to the company. In fact, it has a dedicated team that does sting operations in an attempt to catch businesses willing to pay for fake reviews on the site. If Yelps catches anybody, it will slap the following message on the guilty party's Yelp page, and it also remains there for 90 days:(Source: Yelp)These warnings are an obvious deterrent, especially as more business owners find out that Yelp is doing this to anybody caught in the act.Stoppelman says:Much like Google's ranking algorithm, people are constantly trying to figure out how Yelp's algorithm(s) works, in order to gain an advantage and get a better reputation on the site. But Yelp's software engineers change algorithms multiple times a day. And the company is constantly learning new information from all of this data analysis, which is helping them better identify content that shouldn't be recommended to users of Yelp. Its recommendation software highlights only those reviews that it thinks are going to be most helpful and reliable for consumers.Yelp will delete the fake reviews, but doesn't delete all reviews that are suspicious. Rather, there is a link at the very bottom of the page which says ""other reviews that are not currently recommended. If you click on the link it shows these reviews as well as the disclaimer: ""The reviews below didn't make the cut and are therefore not factored into this business's overall star rating.""As for the Yelp app experience, all of this incredibly useful content has been packaged into a seamless mobile application that is easy to use, very intuitive, and makes it a snap to find what you are looking for. The app is simply an extension of the website itself.Yelp Versus The Competition - 5 StarsYelp is the largest player in the online local business review space, with TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) and Alphabet its main rivals. But I don't consider these two companies that strong of competition for Yelp, as each has several flaws in comparison.Yelp's three core strengths are: Its website/app experience, the number of reviews posted on the site, and the accuracy of its reviews.Yelp and TripAdvisor are a little bit different in terms of the markets they are going after, but they do have areas that overlap. Those being restaurant reviews, and to a lesser extent hotel reviews. TripAdvisor offers several other services for its users such as booking flights and hotels, but it has no other local business categories like Yelp does.There are two big problems with TripAdvisor:1. While it has a sizable number of overall restaurant reviews, the user experience isn't as comprehensive or richly immersive as what you will find on Yelp. User uploaded photos are a big key to enhancing the quality of a review site, and Yelp has a far greater amount of photos on average compared to TripAdvisor. And in many markets - especially in the small and mid size ones - you will find a greater amount of reviews for restaurants on Yelp.2. I'm very skeptical of the reviews that I read on TripAdvisor. As I showed earlier, Yelp takes extraordinary measures to protect consumers from fake reviews. This is further backed up by a 2013 sting operation by the New York Attorney General's office that was trying to catch people/companies writing fraudulent reviews on websites, including Yelp. Yelp was aware of the investigation and cooperated with it. According to the NYAG press release: ""The investigation found that many consumer-review websites have implemented filters to detect and filter or delete fake reviews, with Yelp's being the most aggressive."" Yelp considers this proof that its filter is ""presumably the most progressive and successful.""TripAdvisor, on the other hand, doesn't seem to weed out as many of the fake reviews as Yelp does. And there have been a few stories over the years that back this up. In June of 2015, a restaurant in Italy that didn't even exist topped the rankings on TripAdvisor. Apparently, an Italian newspaper called Italia a Tavola created a fake restaurant profile in order to prove that TripAdvisor has flaws in its ranking system, and wasn't doing enough to prevent fraudulent reviews. The newspaper proceeded to post fake positive reviews of this fictional restaurant, and a month later, it was rated the best restaurant in town on TripAdvisor. Italia a Tavola contacted the company and told them of their ""experiment,"" and the restaurant listing was taken down right away by TripAdvisor.A similar event happened in 2013, as somebody created a fake listing of a restaurant which was supposedly located in a small town in England. This was not some highly skilled attempt to slip through the cracks. This was a blatant, and over the top creation designed to show how even the most ridiculous listings and subsequent reviews can get through. The user that created the listing described the restaurant as ""existing on a fishing vessel that changed location depending on the season, and that staff in diving gear would swim to catch whichever fish the customer desired as part of the service."" The restaurant was ranked at #29 on TripAdvisor's list of top restaurants in the city at one point.In 2014, TripAdvisor was fined $600,000 by Italy's antitrust authority as they claimed the company had ""failed to adopt controls to prevent false reviews, while at the same time promoting the sites content as authentic and genuine.""So when it comes down to it, I trust what I'm reading on Yelp far more than the content that is on TripAdvisor. That's not to say that all reviews - or even the majority - on TripAdvisor are highly suspicious or fake. There are legitimate users on the site leaving honest opinions of these local businesses. To me though, it seems that Yelp just does a better job, and provides more reliable sources of information.As for Alphabet, it went out and bought Zagat in 2011 for $125 million, in an attempt to gain traction in the local review arena after Yelp spurned them. However, this has been a failed effort from the beginning, and Alphabet has made no major inroads onto Yelp's turf. Alphabet is now using its position in search to try and muscle its way into the mix. Before, if you did a Google search for a restaurant, the business's Yelp page was the first thing you would see. Now if you do that same search, you will see reviews from Google users at the top when using a mobile device, or prominently displayed to the right of the search results on a desktop.But the number of reviews that Google offers are minuscule in comparison to Yelp, and the entire experience and quality of the reviews is very generic. There are simply far better options.When I'm searching for a local business or trying to find one, I'm going to use Yelp because it has a great user experience, quality reviews, and sophisticated filtering software that is making sure I'm reading only the most relevant content available. TripAdvisor and Google just don't offer this.I'm not the only one that feels this way either, as the 89 million unique U.S. users of Yelp speaks for itself. Yelp is now the 22nd largest website in the U.S. based on Desktop and Mobile users according to comScore. Last year it was the 26th largest, with 73 million visitors per month on average. Yelp is right there with the heavy hitters of the online space. The company should easily be in the top 20 by this time next year (possibly even top 15), as many just ahead of it don't have the same growth as Yelp. Keep this in mind when you look at Yelp's $1.8 billion market cap. Also notice where TripAdvisor is at.(Source: comScore)One new competitor for Yelp is OpenTable. For years, Yelp promoted OpenTable on its site, as it made sense to offer users the option to book a restaurant reservation online on a review website. The two companies were never competitors, rather they were partners. Now that is all changing, as two years ago Yelp bought a similar service called SeatMe and has been promoting the heck out of it ever since.SeatMe only had 200 customers when Yelp bought them. At the end of the third quarter of 2015, Yelp had over 17,000 restaurants accepting reservations through their paid SeatMe service and Yelp's free reservation product. It took OpenTable over a decade to get that many participating restaurants, and Yelp is closing the current gap fast. Yelp and OpenTable ended their partnership in 2015.(Source: Eater.com)If I were OpenTable, or maybe I should say Priceline (NASDAQ:PCLN), I would be very worried right now. Last year, Priceline bought OpenTable for $2.6 billion, a substantial sum considering OpenTable's revenue was expected to be just $226 million for the year. Now it's not out the realm of possibility for Priceline to have to write off this entire acquisition in a few years time. Yelp would have to execute well, but it could end up crushing OpenTable when it's all said and done.Yelp is hitting them with a one-two punch at the moment. Obviously, with Yelp's embedded user base and restaurant reviews, it's pretty easy to gain a huge amount of customers for a restaurant reservation service. So Yelp has a major advantage in that respect, one that all of these other online reservation companies simply don't have.The other tactic that Yelp is using is really going to start taking a toll on OpenTable. OpenTable charges its customers a pretty hefty sum for its service. There is a $699 one-time installation fee for the management software, and $199 per month for the subscription fee. For online reservations, restaurants are charged $1.00 per seated customer if booked via the OpenTable website, or $0.25 per seated customer if booked on the restaurant's own website.Many restaurant owners complain that OpenTable's fees are too high, and some simply can't afford to offer their patrons this service, particularly due to the exorbitant ""per seated customer"" costs that restaurants have to pay.Yelp on the other hand, is offering its SeatMe service for a simple $99 per month fee, with no additional fees on top of that. Restaurants that use SeatMe won't have to pay the ""per seated customer"" fee that OpenTable is charging.The phrase ""this is a game changer"" gets thrown around a lot in the world of finance, and most of the time the game doesn't really change when it's all said and done. But in this situation, this truly looks like a game changer. One that Yelp can easily afford to do since this is such a natural and easy progression, given the amount of restaurants that have Yelp pages.The Slanted Door, which is one of the highest grossing restaurants in California, was a long-time customer of OpenTable. And it was paying OpenTable about $75,000-$100,000 per year. Recently, it switched to SeatMe, and as a result, will only be paying about $1,200 per year for the same service. The restaurant claims it isn't seeing a decrease in traffic as a result of the switch.There is no loyalty when it comes to an online restaurant reservation service. As a customer, I don't care if I'm using SeatMe or OpenTable, as long as I get my reservation. It's like getting a TaxiCab, do you really care which company it is? Just get me from point A to point B. And if I'm a restaurant owner, if I'm getting the same service offered to me at a fraction of the cost I was paying before, and not losing any traffic as a result, the choice is clear.The writing is on the wall for OpenTable. I don't think it is going to be able to convince most restaurants to continue to use its service, unless it reduces its fee structure substantially. And even then, it most likely wouldn't be able to match the fees that Yelp offers.This is probably why in March of this year, OpenTable announced a rebrand with the new tagline: ""The table is just the start."" Clearly it is attempting to expand beyond the online reservation market, and is now promoting the fact that it has restaurant reviews as well. But it's no better than what Alphabet offers, and in no way comes even close to what Yelp has to offer.Yelp also decided to jump into the online food delivery service this year, as it acquired Eat24 in February for $134 million. The biggest competitor is GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), which just went public in 2014 and sports a market cap of $2.1 billion. I'm not as excited for this new offering by Yelp, as this is a very competitive space and food delivery has been around for a long time. A lot of companies have come and gone over the years, in an attempt to bring this type of service to customers.To me, the issues always come down to cost, speed, and reliability. The delivery service charge can be high for some restaurants, particularly those in more sprawled out cities. When you include a tip on top of that, customers are paying a lot in just delivery charges. You also have the issue with the speed of delivery, as sometimes it can be an hour or more before your food will be delivered. And finally, it's very easy for these restaurants to screw up orders and you end up not getting what you asked for.Providing this service is a little risky, but Yelp can afford to take it on since this isn't its primary business, like it is for GrubHub. Yelp does have an advantage here as well, since it can attract a big audience for this service on the Yelp website. You are seeing this already as Eat24 contributed about $11 million in revenue last quarter.Yelp's Metrics - 5 StarsIt's important to highlight the metrics of Yelp in order to show that regardless of what the stock is doing, its growth remains impressive. Since the website is based on user reviews, then the more that are posted to the site, the more valuable the content becomes - not only to consumers but also to advertisers. At the end of Q3, Yelp had 90 million cumulative reviews, although that figure is a little misleading as it does include some reviews that have since been deleted. It's an impressive figure nonetheless. Some might expect that it's the restaurant category that has the most reviews, but it's actually shopping that comes out on top with 23% of the total vs. 19% for restaurants. Other categories such as home and local, beauty and fitness, and health make up the remaining percentage, which shows you just how diverse the content on Yelp is, and it clearly is a huge repository of local business reviews.(Source: Yelp)Like most internet companies, Yelp has seen a flattening in the number of desktop unique users, as more people are now accessing the internet and their favorite content via mobile devices. Yelp continues to see strong and steady growth in its mobile unique user base. The mobile app is a big reason for this. As a side note, the unique user base shown below includes international users.(Source: Yelp)Steve Jobs, being the visionary that he was, was correct in that more people are now using apps to get data on the internet. And while Yelp's growth in unique users for its app was a little slow a few years ago, it has picked up considerably over the last several quarters. According to Yelp's own logs, the App has over 20 million unique users as of the end of Q3. Since the beginning of the year, the app has been gaining about 2 million users during each quarter.While it's not reflected in the graph below since it's from June 2015, as of September, the Yelp app is now in the top 25 of mobile apps by unique visitors according to comScore. If you look at the growth percentage on the right side of each app listed below, Yelp would be in the top 7 in terms of user growth year over year. And that trend looks like it will continue. This growth in mobile app unique users is important for Yelp, as it will allow the company to bypass Google altogether. And again, Yelp is among the heavy hitters of the space in terms of mobile app unique visitors. Yet, only a $1.8 billion market cap? Come on now.(Source: comScore)As for revenue, that has been an impressive climb as well, with quarter-over-quarter growth continuing unabated. The company expects revenue of around $550 million for 2015, and by 2017 it believes it can hit a run rate of $1 billion. Revenue growth would be even larger, but it has been held back a little this year due to a couple of factors, which I will discuss below.(Source: Yelp)As for international growth, Yelp has been trying to expand into major cities outside the U.S. for 5 or 6 years now. But international revenue has been stagnant since 2013, averaging just around $3 million per quarter. And unique users overseas have been flat as well. While investors and analysts are disappointed that Yelp isn't seeing the same ramp-up in revenue abroad as it saw here in the U.S., the fact is the company hasn't invested what it needs to in order to grow in these new cities. And that is by choice. Yelp is simply planting the seeds and looking at international markets as more of a long-term option. When the time comes, it will triple down on its investments in these new markets. I just don't think this is where Yelp wants to invest its time and money at right now. There are too many opportunities still in the U.S.Yelp's Profitability - 3 Stars (subject to upward revision)So Yelp has all of these incredible things going for it that I discussed above, but when it comes to monetizing the business, the company is struggling at the moment as profits are weak. If you look at the graph of adjusted EBITDA below, it's no coincidence that Yelp's share price started to tank as earnings went into reverse.(Source: Yelp)There are a few things going on here that need to be discussed, as this drop in profitability is just a short-term phenomenon. Issues impacting EBITDA:1. Yelp derives the vast majority of its revenue from advertising. Last year, the company announced it was going to be phasing out the use of banner ads (or display ads) on the site, and instead was switching to native ads. This transition will be complete by the end of 2015. The main reason for this shift, is banner ads simply don't work on mobile devices, as they don't play nicely on small screens and mobile apps.Banner ads are the large ads at the top of most desktop webpages, these are popular with companies looking for brand advertising. For high traffic websites, these ads make sense. Banner ads are also very useful when you have a large screen space to work with, which is why they have been so popular with companies that have lots of desktop unique users. But they are too big and too intrusive to use on most mobile devices and in apps. And many companies - Yelp included - feel that display ads are too disruptive in general (even on the desktop), and are at odds with the focus on the consumer experience.Native ads, on the other hand, are smaller and highly targeted (and look more like a search result than an ad), making them a logical choice for mobile. Since most users are continuing to shift their viewing habits to mobile from the desktop - and Yelp's mobile unique users now make up a larger portion of its audience compared to visitors on desktop computers - there was a good reason for the company to make the change to more mobile friendly and engaging ads that are highly targeted and highly relevant.Many companies are making this change as well. LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) reported a 30% year-over-year decline in display-ad revenue in Q2, and announced at the time that it plan to reduce the amount of banner ads on its site. The New York Times (NYSE:NYT) also announced recently it will transition to using native ads for mobile.Below is an example of these native ads on Yelp. I did a search for steakhouses in New York on both a desktop and the mobile app, and took a screen shot of each one. Instead of the large banner display ad at the top of the desktop site, you have a simple native ad from STK Midtown, and you can see the seamless transition to the mobile app with this ad as well.(Source: Yelp)The native ads are very useful for local businesses since they are highly targeted towards a specific audience or search result. But to keep growing its local ad revenue, Yelp needs to increase its local advertising accounts. And to do that, it needs to keep hiring sales people. The problem is the company hasn't been able to increase its sales headcount fast enough.Yelp is based in San Francisco, and right now the area is having a ""unicorn bubble,"" as big startups that are flush with cash from private financing rounds are going hard after promising employees in the Bay Area. These companies are poaching employees from Yelp as well, as they are interested in acquiring the talent that Yelp has working for them. Specifically on the sales side, given the skills picked up during Yelp's training program for new recruits. And these well-funded start-ups are willing to pay one and a half to two times the salary that Yelp is paying.As a result, Yelp is having to spend more to hire salespeople, and it is adding them at a slower rate than previously expected. This is hurting EBITDA as well as slowing down revenue growth.The company planned for sales headcount growth of 40% for 2015, but by the end of Q2, it reduced it to just 30%. It also cut revenue growth as a result.2. As Yelp was aggressively ramping up its salesforce, it also decided to take geography out of the equation. The company has a huge amount of leads, particularly in densely populated territories. There are a lot of local businesses that Yelp is targeting to advertise on the site. So the company thought it could use a salesperson that was outside of the region, and assign them to these other territories that needed additional sales support. But the plan backfired, as it became clear that having that rapport with those business owners, and the ability to talk about weather, the local sports team, the businesses that they are in competition with, as well as other relevant topics, was very important part of the sales process.Yelp began this reassignment in January of this year, and in March it scrapped the plan and switched back to the old way of doing things. But this misfire did impact revenue and earnings earlier in the year.3. Another factor hurting profitability at the moment is the decision by Yelp to spend $30 million on marketing in 2015 (about $20 million of which is being spent in Q3 and Q4). The company has never done any kind of marketing itself. But last year it did a brand awareness study and found that the Yelp's unaided brand awareness was only around 26%. It also discovered that the vast majority of people using the Yelp app loved it. As a result, the company wanted to do a marketing campaign that promoted the Yelp brand and the app.So the main reason that Yelp is struggling with profitability at the moment is because it has decided to sacrifice short-term profits to grow the business. It is simply investing in its future by aggressive growth of its sales team along with its marketing campaign initiative. These will benefit the business over the long term.The company is still generating operating cash flow (about $10 million last quarter). And with $370 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on the balance sheet, and no debt, it can certainly afford a drop in EBITDA in order to grow faster.Investors have been dumping shares because of this decline in profits. However, there are short-term and long-term catalysts that will bring these investors back to Yelp. Yelp appears to be setting itself up nicely for a strong 2016 in terms of profit margins. And Yelp believes it can achieve adjusted EBITDA margins of 35-40% over the long term. That's more than double what it expects this quarter. The company is well positioned to hit that target.Short-term catalyst:1. This type of hiring bubble in San Fran isn't sustainable, and it should start to subside over the next year or so. Yelp is already taking steps to improve the situation, as it changed the commission ramp rate for rookie sales people. It also opened up an office in Chicago at the beginning of this year, which is alleviating some of the recruiting issues it is having on the West Coast. The company is already seeing a positive impact already, as at the end of Q3, sales headcount growth was at 35%. This should translate into increased revenue next year, which means increased EBITDA.2. The $30 million in TV marketing that Yelp is doing this year will most likely not be repeated in 2016, even if it sees a big return on its investment. That is going to improve EBITDA margins starting in Q1 of next year.3. It takes the new sales recruits about 6-9 months to get up to speed. So while they won't contribute a lot to the top or bottom line this year, they should begin to have an impact in 2016. Yelp has already seen a great performance out of its sales team in September, and that continued into October. The substantial amount of new hires this year should start to really show results next year.EBITDA is expected to improve from $12.5 million in Q3 2015, to $20-$24 million in Q4, even with the increased spend on marketing of $13 million. And then next year, given all of the short-term catalysts I just mentioned, Yelp should see further improvements in EBITDA.Long-term catalysts:I expect profits for Yelp to improve in 2016, as these transitory issues fade. But the real leverage here is in the huge opportunity over the next 1-5 years in local advertising revenue, and in particular mobile.Most people are underestimating the profit potential in mobile for Yelp. This is similar to what Facebook was going through in 2012. The company was suffering from poor bottom line growth and investors were questioning how profitable Facebook would be as the user base was shifting to mobile. As Mark Zuckerberg explained at the time:I was buying Facebook at that time, as the stock was dirt cheap at $17 and it was clear the company would eventually start showing huge profits from mobile advertising. That's exactly what has transpired since.Yelp is in a similar position, and it has a lot of major opportunities for long-term growth from local online advertising, particularly mobile. For the following reasons:1. Yelp has 104,000 local advertising accounts, and 2.5 million in total claimed local business locations (meaning businesses that have a Yelp page). Yelp is only scratching the surface in terms of the amount of potential advertisers in its own ecosystem.2. The vast majority of local advertising dollars are still spent offline, but that trend is changing fast. According to BIA/Kelsey, the total revenue for U.S. Local Advertising in 2016 is expected to reach $146.6 billion, up from $141.3 billion this year. Almost all of that growth is coming from increased online/digital revenues. Specifically, local-targeted mobile ad spending, which is expected to grow from $8.4 billion in 2015, to $11.3 billion in 2016. Obviously, that's great news for Yelp. This shift is expected to continue, as the CAGR of online/digital ad revenues from 2015-2020 is 11.7%, compared to negative compounded growth in traditional local advertising.(Source: BIA/Kelsey)There are billions of dollars in revenue potential from local advertisers that are currently using media outlets such as TV, radio, newspapers, as well as print. Yelp continues to see strong interest from these local businesses who have historically advertised offline, as Yelp is a pretty compelling place for these businesses to spend their money.3. The repeat rate of local advertising accounts - meaning the percentage of businesses that continue to advertise with Yelp - has increased from 75% in 2013, to 77% at the end of Q3 2015. What this shows is Yelp is building a large base of legacy advertisers and recurring revenue.4. According to an August 2015 Nielsen survey that Yelp commissioned, advertisers on Yelp's website reported that for every dollar they invested in ads, they received more than three dollars in return.5. Yelp is selling mostly CPC ads now, a big change from the CPM ads it was selling before. The reason for the shift was because of market demand for CPC offerings. CPC's are good from a supply/demand perspective, and many sophisticated ad buyers will spend thousands of dollars a month on generating leads from Yelp by using these ads, because they know it works.The One RiskAs I have shown, the products and services that Yelp is offering to its users is top notch, nobody is really matching what Yelp has to offer. All of Yelp's website metrics continue to improve quarter over quarter. If unique users were in decline, or total reviews were flattening out, or the app wasn't gaining users, then you might have an argument that Yelp has some long-term issues. But there is nothing really wrong with the business itself, and I just don't see any near-term risks that would change that.This all comes down to the sales team, and how much revenue and profit they can generate by leveraging the valuable content and user base of the company. That is where the risk is at.Yelp is going to be able to attract a lot of local advertising dollars in the future, as it has a tremendous platform for businesses to advertise on. But if the sales force is not highly effective, then EBITDA will suffer.If by this time next year, Yelp still is struggling to show profits, then it's because of the sales team. The product that they are selling is good, so that's not where the fault is going to lie. That should also be considered a positive for Yelp shareholders, as it means the solution is with a change in leadership/strategy of the sales team. In other words, it's a problem that can be fixed.As long as Yelp can continue to ramp up its sales force, and that salesforce is effective, then the company will start to leverage this huge market opportunity and EBITDA will rise dramatically.Summary ReviewI find Yelp a delectable resource for online local business reviews. The quality of its product and level of service is second to none. I know when I go to the site, I'm getting reviews from reliable sources, and I have been a repeat customer for a long time.While the competition might seem formidable, Yelp is still way out in the lead and shows no signs of relinquishing its top spot anytime soon. It is also gaining access to new markets, and could end up being very disruptive to companies such as OpenTable.Yelp's metrics have shown solid quarter over quarter growth for years now, and the company's mobile app is really starting to come on strong.The decision by Yelp to invest heavily in the business has hurt the stock, as profit growth has stalled. But EBITDA margins are expected to improve in Q4, and 2016 should be much improved as Yelp's marketing budget will most likely be reduced and its struggles with adding additional sales people will dissipate. When you factor in all of the huge opportunities to gain more local advertising revenue in the future, it seems only a matter of time before Yelp reaches its goal of 35-40% EBITDA margins.In addition to being a big user of Yelp's products and services, I'm now an investor in the company."

As a result, the stock has also under-performed the broader markets. While the return on Nasdaq has been 0.4%, Yelp’s return has been -53.2%. The primary reason for this has been failure of Yelp’s management to achieve street analysts’ estimates, who were expecting a much higher growth rate than Yelp was able to deliver. Furthermore, Yelp’s efforts to sell itself also failed, which further resulted in stock price decline over the past two months. However, we estimate that with the current growth rate and revenue run rate, from existing signups, the stock is fairly valued at $30.29. The company operates in geographies gives it access to over 76 million local businesses. As the company expands into new regions, its margins and monetization rate will be negatively impacted. Nevertheless, it still remains a dominant player in the $130 billion local ads business market, and should continue to rule the roost in the coming years. However, competition from Facebook and Google is intensifying, which is hurting Yelp’s growth potential. In this note, we explore factors impacting Yelp’s valuation.Local Ads Business Is The Key To GrowthAccording to our estimates, the local ads business makes up over 73% of Yelp’s estimated value. The key drivers for this division are the average revenue per active local business account and the number of active local business accounts listed with Yelp. The company has a total addressable market (NYSE:TAM) of 76 million local businesses in the world, of which 53 million are present in the Americas and Europe. This translates into a global market of nearly $130 billion. According to BIA/Kelsey, online local ad spending in the U.S. is expected to increase from $31 billion in 2014 to $35 billion in 2015. [1] However, the number of active business, which pay for Yelp’s services listed with the company, is just a fraction of this market at 90,200 in Q2 2015. While we expect that the base effect will limit the active business listing CAGR to 30%, we believe that the company can add at least 359,390 active business accounts or 4.5% of 7.98 million claimed businesses by 2022. Our reasons for this growth are as follows:Average Revenue Per Active Business To Grow, Albeit At A Slower RateAverage revenue per active local business (ARPALB) is one of the most important drivers in our valuation for Yelp’s locals ads business. According to Yelp, the monetization rate of a city or region increases with time as more businesses sign up for premium services such as dedicated webpages and call to action to promote their products or services. The company’s ARPALB improved to $7,449 for regions where Yelp started offering services in 2005, and to $546 for regions where Yelp services started in 2010. [2] However, as Yelp introduces its services in new regions, we expect ARPALB to grow at a slower pace, as new regions such as Latin Americas have less spending power compared to the U.S., and fewer businesses in these regions are willing to pay for premium Yelp services. As a result, we expect that the blended ARPALB will grow at a slower rate.Points Of ConcernWhile Yelp has had some success in monetizing the local ads business, it does face some challenges that can impact its valuation:We have also have assessed the impact of assimilation of Eat24 and SeatMe businesses. This assimilation will positively impact the topline by $20 million in 2015 but may further erode profitability due to restructuring charges. Our price estimate for Yelp stands at $30.29, which is 30% above the current market price.Disclosure: None"
3683986,70965,2015-11-13T13:50:07-05:00,"Yelp got upgraded Friday morning by RBC, prompting us to take a look.Much like Etsy, we think Yelp is far beyond its real traction points with consumers and business owners.The valuation here does not support potential future cash generation or earnings for the company.","By Scott TzuFriday morning, RBC raised their price target on Yelp (NYSE:YELP) into the $40 range, a move we just can't agree with. Much like Etsy (NASDAQ:ETSY), which we talked about a couple of days ago, we think Yelp's best days are behind it.We know that there has been some bad press regarding YELP over the last few months and a critical documentary is even being made about the company and supposedly how it ""extorts"" businesses. We're not going to go as far as that, and we're not even going to look at what extremist critics of the company say. What we are going to do, however, is have a little bit of the common sense based approach to why investors should not be buying Yelp at these levels.This was RBC's argument:The problem with a lot of these assumptions is that they fall under a scenario where Yelp is going to have to continue growing organically in coming years, a feat we just don't see the company capable of.Time and time again, the argument has been that Yelp is going to be bought out. We think that the company is far past the meat of its adoption cycle with the public in order for somebody to seriously consider buying the company at these levels. Yelp is not generating a steady profit, and is having trouble growing it's top line at a rate that would make it appealing to a potential acquirer.Furthermore, the fad of going out and going on Yelp to review places you've been to and people you worked with is starting to wear off.We believe restaurant owners don't take these reviews seriously anymore, and many of the critics are people that just want to ""see"" their voices being heard. We surveyed a number of restaurant owners over the last few days, all of whom told us that they keep an eye on Yelp far less than they used to when the website was just becoming popular. Almost all of them said that it is tough to distinguish reviews that are genuine from reviews written out of spite. They also noted that the website has become a forum for negative reviews, but that nobody wants to use the voice to make positive reviews.Yelp claims that it's a community and that there's as many positive reviews as there are negative. And we're sure there's some semblance of democracy as well; we're not accusing Yelp of rigging the game.But what we believe we need to look at with a realistic point of view to gauge Yelp as an investment is both the public perception, combined with the valuation. Let's take a look at how the company is valued.The company is still not really profitable, so it's tough to make assumptions based on an earnings multiple. The company is currently carrying a $1.95 billion market cap, giving it a price/book of 2.7x and an EV/sales of 3.1x, which is arguably the most attractive multiple that the company has going for it. This is the multiple that some will argue makes the company a nice looking acquisition target. But we believe that the company's organic growth will slow, rendering this multiple mostly useless heading forward.The cash flow picture is also concerning for us.We will concede that the company's valuation has come down a lot, as you can see form this chart.Another really positive thing the company has going for it is that it doesn't have any debt. With $368 million in cash on hand and a legitimate book value of about $9 per share, Yelp does have some solid footing to stand on and isn't going to go bankrupt.Whether you want to be paying in the high $20s/low $30s per share for the company is another story. Yelp is barely, occasionally eking out some free cash, as you can see above. This metric is teeter tottering on the positive/negative line, and we believe that if growth slows, the company could quickly wind up burning a lot of cash, putting it into the NFLX or TSLA category. All of these metrics combined make it hard for us to recommend Yelp at today's prices.This valuation is still conducive to a company that has a large growth runway ahead of it. We do not believe Yelp is gaining traction with both business owners and reviewers alike. This is a dangerous combination, and we think it's a prescription for Yelp's multiples to once again contract instead of expand.Don't let the $25 share price fool you, Yelp isn't cheap.When all is said and done, the story just doesn't make sense to us. We don't think the company is an inherently bad company, and we don't think poorly of management, we just think that there is a disconnect between how the market is currently pricing the equity and what the return is going to be from the company over the next 5 to 10 years.Right now having an earnings multiple of over 1000x, assumes that the company's growth trajectory is at least going to be able to say the same for the next 5-10 years one would think, right? And we know it's all about the revenue growth right now. But what happens if the revenue growth starts to flatten out in coming quarters? Or in 2 years? 5 years?We can sum up our investment thesis with this question. Ten years from now, do you think people will still be writing Yelp reviews?"

3509816,22148,2015-09-15T18:29:19-04:00,Yelp continues to struggle growing MAUs.The regulatory decision in Russia and ongoing EU regulatory work provides a potential catalyst for international growth.The stock doesn't require regulatory help for a rebound due to the emergence of the mobile app.,"As Yelp (NYSE:YELP) continues trading near multi-year lows and at attractive valuation metrics, it is a good time to step back and review the opportunity. As highlighted previously, the consumer review site is hampered by the efforts of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to push search traffic towards it's own reviews. The news of the day though suggests that some regulatory help is on the way.The biggest issue is whether one wants to invest in Yelp based on the company needing regulatory help. In that regards, the company can help itself with the mobile app providing a couple of catalysts for growth.Positive International SignalBased on a complaint by Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), Russia decided that Google broke antitrust laws. Of course, Yandex is a Russian company, so it isn't a big surprise that it quickly favored the local company to prevent the dominance of Google.In this case, Google was found to abuse its dominant market position in mobile to encourage device manufacturers to install Google search and map apps over competitors. The complaint is similar to the one under consideration by the EU regulators with an expected decision this month.Any benefit from a positive EU ruling would be crucial in keeping Google from blocking or reducing the ranking of Yelp reviews on consumer searches. The international user numbers remain extremely small relative to the U.S. despite the company entering significantly more locations. In fact, the lack of user growth is a big part of the stock collapse in the last year.As an example, Yelp officially entered the following international markets in 2014/2015:The number of users though hasn't grown from a near peak of 31.1 million users in Q1 2014. The Q1 2015 number was only slightly higher, but the Q2 2015 users were actually down 1.2 million users despite launching in all of the above markets in the last year or so. Not to mention, most large international markets like Germany and Brazil are far from saturated.Clearly, Yelp has a major problem finding users if the number of markets have grown from 24 to 32 in the last 15 months or so, yet the number of users is down. Yelp isn't even averaging one million monthly users per international location leaving tons of upside with some regulatory relieve.App KeyUnless an investor wants an investment thesis solely based on the actions of a government body that may or may not happen, another basis of the investment story is the mobile app. Prior to this year, Yelp failed miserably to promote the app in order to grab traffic that bypasses the Google machine. Yelp is spending roughly $20 million this year in marketing to promote the app and the Yelp service in general.According to App Annie, the Yelp app consistently ranked higher in 2015 than in prior years showing signs that the marketing is working.Source: App AnnieOf course, the above data only includes iOS users that are far swamped by the number on Android, especially outside the U.S., but it is a good indication that the mobile app is gaining traction. Probably more important than the progress in breaking the international log jam with Google, the key Q3 number is the mobile app users. For Q2, the number grew 51% over last year to 18.1 million.TakeawayInvestors need to keep in mind that despite the above-mentioned traffic issues, Yelp already has a captive audience in excess of 100 million monthly active users. With a market cap of only $1.8 billion, the stock trades at only 2.5x the 2016 revenue estimate of nearly $700 million. The company continues monetizing existing traffic at higher rates.Solving the Google issue is a catalyst for higher stock prices and not a requirement to justify the current price. Investors should continue lurking for the best entry point as the current valuation is too cheap, but the ongoing transition away from brand advertising and traffic issues will make the stock volatile for now."
3485846,84546,2015-09-02T16:41:08-04:00,Yelp has a dominant market share in the crowdsourced review space and is becoming a vertical search engine.Yelp's total addressable market is continually increasing due to evolving lifestyle preferences.Yelp has a definite value-add proposition for local business to advertise on its platform compared to competitors.,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is a platform with 142 million monthly unique visitors that facilitates and connects people with local businesses by providing a review site for consumers to share their experiences. There is essentially no competition left in the crowdsourced review market space, as pure play competitors like Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI) and Urbanspoon have failed to stick. The largest competitors for advertising revenues lie outside this space, namely Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Yahoo (YHOO), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and AOL (NYSE:AOL). One look at Yelp's social media outlook shows that even whist the stock price has dropped significantly, the amount of mentions on Twitter has not declined.https://www.tickertags.com/Total Address Market is GrowingAs Restaurants & Bars become a greater part of total food expense, consumers will naturally use Yelp more often. Furthermore, as restaurant spending overtakes grocery store purchases, more restaurants will spring up to meet this demand. The greater the selection of restaurant choices, the harder a time people will have of picking a place to eat. Many of these consumers will rely on word-of-mouth and popular opinion to mold their beliefs about different restaurants. Thus, the total addressable market for Yelp is extremely large, estimated at 73 million local businesses worldwide in 2013, and still growing.http://assets.bwbx.io/images/iV1gFGu7Cm50/v2/-1x-1.pngIt is no secret that, spurred by Generation Y, there is a newfound importance placed on healthy eating and lifestyle choices. Again, this is a trend that has only positive implications for Yelp because the more sensitive people are to what types of food they eat, the more reliant they are on a reference system.There are worries that the search engine behemoths Google and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have plans to launch their own crowdsourced user-review systems and divert search engine traffic away from Yelp. This could be a problem for desktop searches, but as users shift to mobile and download Yelp's app, this potential issue is completely bypassed.Yelp holds restaurants and businesses accountable. Knowing that mistreating customers or providing subpar food can easily translate to a bad review, businesses are much more cognizant of providing top-notch products and services. The presence of Yelp magnifies great businesses as well as terrible businesses, helping direct consumers to stellar businesses while leaving poorly-run businesses to languish.Advertising OutlookFrom the business side, local restaurants leverage Yelp as a free marketing tool to enhance their digital presence whether it is through offering check-in discounts or Yelp-specific promotions.It is hard to ignore that Facebook as a large threat to Yelp's entire profit mechanism. While local businesses prefer to advertise on Facebook, Yelp will have a hard time monetizing its platform. Local businesses usually have Facebook pages, sometimes with reviews, but it is not easily navigated on mobile, has low traffic, and not a focus for Facebook going forward. Targeted ads on Facebook for restaurants have the issue that they are advertising to those not necessarily searching for a place to eat or a hotel to reserve whereas Yelp ads are primarily displayed to people actively deciding between restaurants or bars. It is inevitable that in the long-run, advertisers will flock to where each ad dollar most efficiently trickles to the bottom line, which should be Yelp given its closer proximity to a spending customer.As Yelp's popularity and engagement increases, it is steadily becoming a vertical search engine where users bypass a traditional search engine and instead search ""Sushi in Plano, Texas"" on Yelp. While this may not directly trickle down to Yelp's bottom line, it does incentivize businesses to advertise more with Yelp rather than through Facebook or traditional means.The Bottom LineSome will argue that Yelp is a growth stock that is not growing, in the vein of Twitter. The difference there is that people use Twitter in addition to other social media networks like Facebook, Instagram, or SnapChat, so migrating away from one social network has little friction. Yelp on the other hand, is the dominant user-review system with a database of millions of reviews that cannot be easily replicated by a competitor. This entrenched competitive advantage of Yelp over its peers is why Yelp will be hard to topple.Yelp is beneficial to both consumers and businesses alike. The company's value add is that it is a reference tool for consumers while it serves as a marketing tool to businesses. When a company with dominant market share in an industry satisfying both sides of the coin, there is little long-term risk. Short-term, there are issues with high expectations regarding forward-looking multiples, valuation, and profitability, but Yelp has such a significant that even if does not successfully increase profitability, the company is a very likely candidate to be acquired by a tech giant."
3403435,29111,2015-08-05T16:01:35-04:00,"Yelp has taken a beating in 2015, leading to some investors calling for a substantial rebound based on fundamentals and growth rate.Despite the revenue growth rate being in the 50% range, Yelp is still overpriced as high costs have eaten away profit margins.Based on a PEG Ratio of 1.5, 50% revenue growth and a 2016 expected EPS of $0.30, YELP's fair value should be $22.50.YELP has the potential to trade far lower than $22.50 as the expected EPS for next year is only $0.10.","Yelp Inc. (NYSE:YELP) has taken an absolute beating since it released disappointing financial results on July 28. This has led to a slew of investors claiming that Yelp has cheap valuation metrics for a growth company as well as a strong balance sheet so the downward move has been overdone. Other commentators believe that Yelp's decline to the mid-$20's is just another step towards its eventual slide to penny stock status. After reading the 10-Q, I lean towards the short side, particularly as the company has had a few days of a ""dead cat bounce"" after plummeting 25% on July 29.While revenue growth and mobile usage is robust, costs are spiraling out of control. The company is having trouble retaining sales people and the salaries of engineers and other technology personnel are quickly rising as private equity tech firms are being aggressive with their hiring. Product development costs have increased from 17% to 20% of revenue this year even as revenue has increased over 50%, reflecting the competitive nature for engineers and web developers. Sales and marketing costs have decreased as a percentage of revenue from 56% to 52%, largely because the company has involuntarily reduced its target on hiring.These costs have made it difficult for the company to pull a profit despite the strong revenue growth, and also casts a shadow of doubt upon Yelp's ability to continue with that robust growth as salespeople targets are missed and top talent responsible for running Yelp's mobile and desktop applications could be lured elsewhere. Here are a few key statistics derived from revised analyst consensus expectations and company guidance:2016 EPS: $0.102016 EPS (90 days ago): $0.502015 Revenue: $547 million2015 Adjusted EBITDA: $75 million5-year growth estimate: 52.55%At a stock price of $26, Yelp has a market cap of $2 billion and enterprise value of $1.6 billion. That leads to metrics of:Forward P/E: 260.0P/S: 3.7EV/EBITDA: 21.3EV/Revenue: 2.9PEG Ratio: 4.9 (calculated as 260/52.55)A bullish article from Brian Nichols states that Yelp's EV/Revenue of 2.9 is:I agree that relative to companies like Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Yelp has much lower revenue multiples. However, Yelp is not a social media company, it is a place where people can provide and review feedback for local businesses. I believe the most similar multi-billion dollar comparable to Yelp in terms of function would be TripAdvisor Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP), which has the following valuation metrics:Forward P/E: 30.0P/S: 8.0EV/EBITDA: 31.5EV/Revenue: 8.0PEG Ratio: 1.6Yelp is about two to three times cheaper than TRIP on a revenue basis, but its lower margin business means that YELP trails TRIP substantially on forward earnings and on its PEG Ratio, which I believe are the most appropriate valuation metrics for a mature online business such as Yelp.Another bullish article by Zenith Investments has a price target of $38 on YELP based on a 30 forward P/E ratio and uses this high P/E because revenue growth is in the 50% range. The issue with that is the company is currently trading at a 260 forward P/E ratio as earnings expectations have greatly eroded over the past three months. A 30 forward P/E would now be a $3 target on Yelp. The author appears to be using Yelp's guidance of $72-$78 million on FY2015 Adjusted EBITDA as the standard for which to judge forward P/E. Adjusted EBITDA excludes depreciation and stock compensation expenses, both of which are substantial for Yelp.I believe the best metric for which to judge Yelp is the PEG Ratio, which divides the forward P/E by 5-year expected growth rate. As mentioned above, TRIP has a PEG ratio of 1.6. Even high-beta social media stocks like Twitter and Facebook have PEG Ratios of 1.3 and 1.6 respectively, so it would be a hard sell for Yelp longs to justify a PEG above 1.6 for this ""internet information provider"", whether they wish to point to social media stocks or other online review sites as comparables.Let's say that analysts have overreacted and that Yelp can reasonably achieve a $0.30 EPS next year which is the mid-point between the $0.10 current expectation and $0.50 expectation made three months ago. A 1.5 PEG Ratio on 50% revenue growth would lead to a P/E of 75. A P/E of 75 would lead to a stock price of $22.50.A lot of things have to go right for the company in order for it to attain a $0.30 EPS next year. There are a number of things that could go wrong for the company. Talent could be poached as engineers look for more lucrative opportunities elsewhere and sales people become weary of the ""hard sell"" techniques which some people have claimed YELP employs on its addressable market. Should top engineers leave, that exposes YELP to Google and Apple's attempts to get into the locate and review business. It's well-documented that Yelp's desktop usage is dropping due to Google's search algorithms that favor its own review results. Yelp's app may face the same problem when running on iOS or Android based Smartphones in the future as those platforms can include Google or Apple's offerings as default software. That means Yelp must remain one step above those applications in order to entice users to download its app and not just use whatever is already available on their phone. There is no guarantee that the company will succeed in doing so.Yelp is at least 15% overpriced even at a $0.30 EPS which is substantially above analysts' expectations for 2016. Yelp may be even more overpriced when considering the challenges that are unfolding for the company as larger companies look to take its market share, and smaller private companies try to poach its talent or at least drive up the costs of hiring that talent needed to support the business. I recommend Yelp as an excellent short opportunity as it appears to be a value trap for some investors, while exhibiting very little actual fundamental value even as the stock has eroded nearly 75% from its high 18 months ago."

However, last week, B. Riley's Sameet Sinha upgraded the rating for the company from Sell to Neutral, with a price target of $22. Analyst Sameet Sinha says that the upgrade was a result of Yelp's stock being within 5% of the price target, near-term issues already reflected in the valuation, and improvement in traffic to the site after June. He adds,Yelp hit a 52-week low of $20.50 last week while they had hit a 52-week high of $86.88 last year. Their stock is currently trading at $23.96 with a market cap of $1.8 billion.

The stock spiked as much as 2.5% before then falling back to the price it was trading at beforehand. This rounds out an ugly month for the online review company.When the company was the target of numerous rumors of a potential buyout, we wrote an article expressing that we thought a buyout (for the rumored price of $66+) was unlikely. Our main gripe with the company was its valuation,Today, we disagree with Citron's comments that the sell off may be overdone and we're going to cite the very same reasoning.First, let's look at why the stock sold off in the first place. The company reported earnings in late July that brought with them unimpressive guidance. That was followed by 7 downgrades from major firms like Bank of America and Cowen. Both sales guidance and EBITDA guidance were less than expected with the company cutting EBITDA guidance to $72 million to $78 million versus the estimated $102 million to $105 million.The company also cut its salesforce growth guidance, a move that is usually undertaken by massive companies that are looking to juice the bottom line, not by up and coming aggressive companies that are still in startup phase.In addition to that misery, the company stopped disclosing total unique visitors, a move that companies undertake when they think a particular data point isn't going to satisfy the street any longer (see MAU reports from companies like Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA)). This note from Seeking Alpha points out Morgan Stanley's comments that desktop users have declined and that mobile growth is slowing.Here is the move the stock has made in just the last year, as the fundamentals can't seem to catch up to Wall Street's big expectations for the company.If YELP were still an aggressively growing young company, we'd be willing to cut the company some slack on its valuation. Due to the poor guidance the company offered, combined with our long standing prognostication that Yelp will eventually fall victim to the online review business it created, we take a more skeptical look at the company's valuation.When you do this, it becomes clear that $26 may still be too high for YELP. We think the company would deserve a look under $20, and we think potential acquirers will probably wait for a similar price (at least near $22 or lower) before placing a bid for the company, if that is to happen at all.The way that the company's earnings estimates have been revised down from just 90 days ago is very telling. See this chart.On an earnings basis, it's tough to value the company here. Yelp isn't consistently profitable, nor do we think it's going to be in the coming couple of quarters. We think a 2.5x book value is more than generous for YELP, which would put shares somewhere near $21.This is still about 20% downside from today's price near $26. At a forward multiple that's approaching 250x and no consistency with earnings, we'd question what people buying here are looking for?We don't see the long case as much more than hoping a company like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will come in and acquire the company without warnings. Should this not happen and YELP have to stand its ground on its own, we think shares move closer to $20."
3471706,23479,2015-08-27T12:49:17-04:00,"Over the past few months, Yelp’s stock price has plunged by nearly 60%.However, we estimate that Yelp’s stock is worth $30.29 based on the total addressable market for its core local ads business.According to our estimates, the local ads business makes up over 73% of Yelp’s estimated value.","Over the past few months, Yelp’s (NYSE:YELP) stock price has plunged by nearly 60%. However, we estimate that Yelp’s stock is worth $30.29 based on the total addressable market (TAM) for its core local ads business. According to Borell Associates, in 2015 local digital advertising spending will hit $47.8 billion globally, accounting for two-fifths of the $115 billion local advertising market in the world, which includes internet, bill board and TV ads. [1] Furthermore, Yelp has access to over 76 million local businesses across the the USA, Europe, Latin America and parts of Asia. Considering the markets Yelp operates in, we expect that Yelp’s local ads business to grow, albeit at a slower pace. However, most of the growth for Yelp is expected to come from its mobile app as local mobile ads take center stage. In this note, we explore the factors that will help the growth in its local ads business, and why the mobile platform will provide most of the growth in the coming years.Local Ads Business to Grow, Albeit At Slower PaceAccording to our estimates, the local ads business makes up over 73% of Yelp’s estimated value. The key drivers for this division are the average revenue per active local business account and the number of active local business accounts listed with Yelp. According to BIA/Kelsey, online local ad spending in the U.S. is expected to increase from $31 billion in 2014 to $35 billion in 2015. [2] As stated earlier, the company has a TAM of 76 million local businesses in the world, of which 53 million are present in the Americas and Europe. However, the number of active advertising business, which pay for Yelp’s services, listed with the company is just a fraction of this market at 97,000 in Q2 2015. While we expect that the base effect will limit the active business listing CAGR to 30%, we believe that the company can add at least 359,000 active business accounts by 2022. The factors that will impact growth are as followsMobile Local Ads To Power Growth In The FutureOver the past few years, online mobile ads have come to the fore and displaced online desktop ads from the top position. As a result, more ad dollars are now budgeted for mobile ads and the allocation for mobile local ads has also increased over the past few quarters. In April 2015, BIA/Kelsey estimated that US mobile location-targeted ad spending would rise 56% this year, versus 37% growth for national (not location-targeted) placements. BIA/Kelsey forecast that mobile location-targeted ads would continue to outpace national placements in spending increases through at least 2019. It expects that ad spending is to hit $18.2 billion for national placement and $24.4 billion for mobile location-targeted ads.Most of the users have a tendency to check up on local businesses, particularly restaurants, when they are on the move. As a result, Yelp’s mobile app has gained traction in the recent quarters. For example in Q2 2015 monthly mobile unique visitors outpaced desktop visitors. While the company reported nearly 83 million unique users for mobile app and web, the desktop user count was stagnant at 79 million. Furthermore, 55% of new reviews and 56% of the ad impressions came from mobile devices. Considering the rampant growth in the usage of mobile devices, we expect the mobile platform to become a major revenue driver for Yelp in the coming years. We believe adoption of Yelp’s mobile platform will drive this growth in unique visitors on the Yelp site, which in turn will lead to more businesses signing up for Yelp. This will also help the company to improve ARPABLB.Disclosure: None"
3375575,73185,2015-07-30T11:14:56-04:00,"We believe the YELP sell-off is overdone and provides investors with an interesting investment opportunity with near-term upside.Our DCF model yields a fair value of roughly $28 per share, more than 10% higher than current market value.We believe Yelp serves a purpose, whereas other social technology platforms appeal to a desire, and further believe Yelp's utility possesses cross-generational appeal.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) has lost about one-fourth of its market cap in the past day and is currently trading only a few cents above $25. We believe the sell-off is overdone and provides investors with an interesting investment opportunity with near-term upside.As of yesterday, management was guiding for roughly $547 million in net sales for 2015, representing about 45% YoY growth. Revenues should continue to explode as old media continues to cede revenue to new media. From our standpoint, Yelp has a brand presence and value-added service that should translate into economic value as the company continues to expand and monetize.Market saturation is not an issue now nor in the foreseeable future. The global market was roughly $130 billion in 2014, while Yelp generated revenues of around $400 million last year. From a revenue market share standpoint, that is less than 0.0001% market penetration. Despite competition from other social media giants, we do not foresee competition or saturation concerns in the future given the size of the market.We believe revenues can grow at a 29% CAGR into 2019, following a strongly logarithmic growth trend with a 45% growth rate in 2015 slowing to a 15% growth rate in 2019. Margins should also pick back up to 2014 levels, and we model for net profit margin to get to 12% by 2019. This is about 250 basis points higher than 2014's net profit margin, and we actually feel this is conservative because Yelp could illustrate better expense control over that time frame that a 250 basis point jump over 5 years.We assume depreciation grows at a markedly slower rate than revenues. Management is guiding for depreciation to be about 5.5% of revenues this year, and as revenues explode, we believe this margin should steadily fall. We model for stock comps to stay right around $60 million per year, and decreases in accounts receivable to pick up as revenues grow.If we plug these Free Cash Flow projections into our DCF model with 2% perpetuity rate and 10% discount rate, we arrive at a fair value of $28 per share. The CAPM discount rate is 13.36% due to Yelp's high Beta value; however, at these low levels, we feel that 10% is a more accurate required rate of return as we feel the stock is near a bottom given chart analyses. We are currently a little over 10% shy of this fair value, and so we believe shares a good pick-up at this price.Yelp is a widely used product, and we believe its use, unlike many other social technology platforms, appeals to a cross-generational audience. We believe this because restaurant reviews and directions are utilities that have broad appeal, and are useful to a variety of persons. In our opinion, Yelp serves a purpose, whereas other social technology platforms appeal to a desire. We believe purpose has a longer runway than desire, and thus have greater faith in investing in Yelp after a sell-off than other social tech platforms."
3375745,65443,2015-07-30T11:47:55-04:00,"Yelp is worth around $38 a share, allowing investors to buy shares for a 33% discount.However, I doubt that Yelp will ever recover to its highs of the past year.There is also a solid chance of Facebook or Google acquiring Yelp, and engaging in a bidding war with each other.","Generally I don't believe that investors should buy stocks on the hopes that a company may buy it, but I'm going to make an exception for Yelp (NYSE:YELP), given that it is also currently cheap. This is because its stock has plummeted over the past year, down an astronomical 63% over the past year.However, I differ from some other bullish writers in that I believe that much of this decline has been well deserved. They have continuously slashed guidance over the last few quarters, and once again did so in their most recent quarter (the cause of their most recent 25% decline). In the most recent earnings call a co-founder resigned, and they eliminated their brand ads - which is their higher margin type of ad. There does seem to be problems with Yelp the business, not just negative sentiment. Their earnings for the current quarter were mixed as well, despite having lowered guidance last quarter. Additionally, Yelp was tremendously overvalued to begin with as well, back when it traded as high as $100 a share, and a non-existent P/E. All this poor performance deserved to be punished.At this point though, Yelp has fallen more than enough. This means that I don't think investors who have bought Yelp more than a couple of months ago are likely to be rewarded, and don't expect to see Yelp back at a $100 a share for many years at the very least. I can't predict what the share price will actually be in the short-term since the sentiment surrounding Yelp is wildly negative. But I don't think it should decline any further, based on fundamentals.Right now, Yelp is worth $1.87 billion and has a very strong cash position of roughly 390 million, which means liquidity isn't likely to be a problem. Their total assets (not counting intangibles and goodwill) stands at ~$500 million. Subtracting the 60 million in liabilities leaves you with 440 million dollar in net tangible value. This means that based on current and future earnings alone, Yelp is worth 1.5 billion. They're expecting 72 to 78 million dollars in adjusted earnings, and the midpoint of that is 75 million - giving Yelp a forward P/E of 20 at its current price. Yelp is still predicting 54% year over year revenue growth, which is very high compared to the rest of the market. Given that Yelp has been somewhat unreliable with guidance before, and this is non-GAAP we're talking about, a forward P/E of around 30 seems to be fair. Add the cash back in and Yelp would trade at around $38 a share based on its current fundamentals alone.This gives investors a nice 33% margin of safety. However, a potential acquisition could sweeten the deal. It's well known that Yelp was looking around for buyers before, but ultimately decided not to sell. Despite this, a potential acquisition continues to make sense - even if the initial offers won't be very high. The risk of Yelp being part of a competitor is likely to spur Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG)/ Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to offer better offers (those two are also the companies most likely to buy the company, and both be bidding for Yelp). Both companies also have histories that favor the possibility of an acquisition.After all, Google paid around 3 times (a billion dollars more) than what they thought YouTube was actually worth because they feared what the reprecussions of someone other than them owning YouTube would be. Facebook is well known for making head scratching deals, such as paying 19 billion dollars for Whatsapp, or 1 billion for Instagram. Of the two, I think Facebook is more likely to buy Yelp as it has more to gain by doing so. Integrating Yelp's product would strengthen Facebook's presence among small businesses - getting everything related to finding a small business under one roof (advertising, reviews, booking, etc). Google would want Yelp since its more popular than Google Reviews - similarly to how YouTube was more popular than Google Video.The risk to this is the bad blood that exists between Yelp and Google, as Yelp is partially responsible for a lot of Google's legal troubles in Europe. This makes a bidding war less likely. However, Yelp still does trade at a discount to fair value regardless, making it a buy."
3614756,87366,2015-10-28T14:42:00-04:00,Competition.Lack of profitability.Weak technical conditions.,"Everyone's a critic, and as a recent episode of South Park points out, the more information available (food reviews, e.g.), the less valuable that information becomes. Online reviews have grown in scope, with everything from restaurants to people subjected to scrutiny and praise. The Internet is saturated with reviews as more and more companies develop and provide review platforms. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) compete directly with Yelp (NYSE:YELP), and these three companies possess many competitive advantages when it comes to maneuvering online traffic. Because of the vast range of products and locations that receive online reviews, it's unlikely that any one company will develop a dominant or preferred platform. The value of reviews online will continue to diminish as will the value of ads, clicks, user numbers, eyeballs and any other metric associated with these reviews. For companies like Yelp competition is fierce and in every corner of the Internet. And Wall Street or any potential buyer will need to see some substantial profit from the company going forward.Back in June I recommended investors should avoid, sell or short Yelp, and since that time the stock has fallen nearly 50%. Yelp's business model is deteriorating, and profitability remains illusive for the company's ""valuable"" reviews and user base. The stock, however, has more downside left in the tank.EarningsYelp's lack of profitability in an ever-increasing competitive market suggests that no potential buyers are lining up and that the stock price has nowhere to go but down. Profit margins remain weak and operating margins are virtually non-existent making the company's cost of revenue seem unsustainable. Restaurant advertising is another category where Yelp will likely under deliver with revenue growth expectations. As you can see from the above chart, Yelp expects to report a negative EPS number again this quarter as the company guided down last quarter. Profitability will not just arrive overnight, and guidance will play an even bigger role this time around. The company must convince Wall Street that profitability becomes part of Yelp's business sooner than later, and how they plan to do that should be interesting, to say the least.As unpredictable as the market acts history seems to find ways of repeating itself, and Yelp dropped nearly 30% after last quarter's earnings call. As silly as it sounds, the sell-off was more than justified, and Yelp has much further stock depreciation left in the tank. Consider these numbers from last quarter's earnings call:That was Chief Financial Officer Rob Krolik describing the quarter, and it's no wonder the stock got crushed after this report. Yelp's plans on shifting around their sales force to focus on local advertising, which management hopes will account for 90% of the company's revenue in by 2017. The share count continues to grow, as do expenses, and user metrics alone will not help the stock price. Money. Profit. Only two metrics can really get Yelp's stock price moving again because the street punishes Internet companies with no earnings and a negative EPS, especially in the late-stages of a bull market or the beginnings of a bear market. Regardless, Yelp's earnings should prove insufficient for this market.Weak Technical ConditionsThe biggest, and best, catalyst for the short thesis is earnings season. Specifically on Wednesday October 28th, when Yelp reports after the bell. Yelp briefly popped above its 50-day moving average on Monday, and subsequently dropped back below the following Tuesday, and this happened earlier in the month on October 11th and 12th. No news and scattered sentiment seem to move the stock every now and then, but the outlook remains weak, and the chart does not look good for bulls or bottom feeders. In Yelp's case, ""hope"" best describes the bull thesis, and it might take a ""hail-Mary"" or some other miracle for the company and stock to get going again. Betting against a miracle seems reasonable and favors the short thesis. Fundamental support does not exist, no likely buyer is emerging, and a stock chart that looks like a cliff best describes Yelp.Final ThoughtsThere exist many risks with shorting equities and investors should be aware of these risks, which include loss of capital. Stop losses, bear spreads and other options can help to alleviate some of the risks associated with a short position. Small positions also prevent large losses, and averaging down can keep you in the game a little longer. The market can be inefficient, or irrational, and that can be one of the biggest risks to a short, or long, position."

Yelp had a EPS loss of ($0.02) on $133.9M of revenue. We had forecast $0.00 of EPS and $130M of revenue. The Street's consensus was for $133M of revenue and EPS of $0.01. The key takeaways from the conference call are:By the NumbersData sheet from Yelp's Q2 earnings slide deckVisualWe're glad to present this technical analysis from Paul Mosgovoy, President of Three Ten Trading.Chart produced by TC2000 which is a registered trademark of Worden Brothers, Inc., P.O. Box 1139 Wilmington, NC 28402. Ph. 800-776-4940 or 919-408-0542. Worden.comBest NewsBy all metrics, Yelp's platform continues to drive improved engagement and usage growth. Reviews, app downloads and mobile traffic all increased y/y. The Yelp app now accounts for 70% of new business reviews and pictures. The company's efforts to reach local advertisers continue to yield good results as accounts for this service reached a record high in Q2. Yelp's earlier mistakes in sales territory adjustments are being rectified. That's key because Yelp simply can't afford sluggish growth in local ad sales. The transaction revenue stream, while growing rapidly, is building from a tiny base.Graphs from the Yelp Q2 slide deckWorst NewsWhy did Yelp decide to eliminate its high-margin Brand Advertising business? We have no clue. The company's press release stated that it would, ""phase out its brand advertising product by the end of 2015 to continue its focus on the consumer experience and its native, local advertising products."" The management team referenced the loss of too much digital real estate to brand ads, too, but we remain skeptical. A likely factor in this decision is that marketing such ads was becoming increasingly difficult and the resulting revenue couldn't support the necessary infrastructure and sales team. Let's be honest, though: If Yelp could sell lots of high-margin ads to large corporations, they would do so unless website/app users complained. We've never heard of anybody who hated the brand ads more than any other internet sales pitches, so it seems unlikely that there was a massive backlash against such ads.We're also disappointed that Yelp is struggling to monetize its international operations. $3M in foreign revenue for Q2 represents a second q/q decline. That's not good news for a company that's ending one line of business by the end of the year. Without international sales growth, Yelp is too dependent upon U.S. local advertising for its profits for our taste.The Forward ViewThe Forward View valuation model doesn't like Yelp at all because free cash flow isn't going to be meaningful for a few years. Thus, we won't present a quantitative assessment of the company's intrinsic worth. Using a relative valuation methodology, we apply a $25 target price for the stock and a Sell rating. Wednesday's trading will peel off at least 10-15% from the pre-earnings stock price. We're thus predicting an additional 15% decline by the end of 2015. Forward View believes that a sale of the company is possible in 2016 if local advertising growth continues and transaction revenue ramps quickly. Our earnings estimates are presented below."
3369085,67313,2015-07-30T10:35:08-04:00,YELP's weak guidance sent the shares lower but the sell-off is overdone in my view.YELP continues to have strategic value to large internet companies that look to move into local advertising.Remain bullish on YELP as M&A premium is not factored into the stock.,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) reported $134m, +51% y/y, in revenue and non-GAAP EPS of $0.12 that missed consensus. Worst of all, guidance for Q3 revenue of $139-$142m was short of the consensus $157m due to slower growth and the elimination of the brand advertising product. The street sold off on the weak guidance and the company announced the resignation of co-founder and Chairman Max Levchin.In my view, YELP's share pullback presents long-term investors with an attractive entry point. Despite the slower outlook and the phasing out of the brand ad product, which contributed $8.3m in the quarter, YELP's other segments are doing fairly well. Local advertising grew at 43% y/y to $108m, and it was particularly encouraging to see solid growth from transaction revenue, which totaled $11.3m, vs. $1.2m a year ago due to the acquisition of Eat24. Additionally, operating metrics continue to support a sustainable growth profile with mobile unique visitors surpassing that of the desktop for the first time in the company's history with 83m (vs. 79m in desktop). YELP's solid mobile MUV base positions the company well for the eventual online-to-offline trend that will take off here in North America.I note that China has surpassed the US in terms of O2O penetration given the established merchant information and service providers such as Dianping, backed by Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY). Dianping operates similarly to Yelp where users can provide reviews but Dianping goes one step further by incorporating Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) like features onto its platform and incorporates Tencent's own payment service so users can purchase goods and services online and retrieve them offline. YELP's merchant information and relationship is a highly valuable component of O2O but lacks a payment service, something that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is working on. Once a payment structure is established, I believe that YELP will once again resume being a strategic target for AAPL, GOOG and even Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) as large internet companies look to incorporate local advertising within their broader ecosystem.YELP is not just any mobile platform. The company's apps saw +51% app usage over the quarter and a majority of the consumer engagement occurs in the app with 70% of reviews, photos, calls, clicks and map views coming from the app. As long as engagement remains consistent, I believe that YELP will continue to have the capability of attracting users and this will ultimately translate to a favorable financial impact.At the current valuation, there does not appear to be an M&A premium put on the stock and I believe that at this price investors are just paying for organic growth. Nonetheless, I strongly believe that M&A value exists in YELP and the near-term pullback can only make the valuation more attractive, drawing potential buyers looking to scoop up the asset."
3369225,22148,2015-07-29T10:51:06-04:00,The downward momentum continues to add up at Yelp.The local consumer review site provided weak revenue guidance due to a couple of short-term factors that didn't please the market.Yelp continues to have compelling growth in key metrics generally misunderstood by the market which focuses on flawed total unique users.,"Prior to reporting Q215 earnings, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) traded at multi-year lows. The momentum the stock saw in rushing above $100 in early 2014 was all about gone so it wasn't a big shock that any perceived negative news sent the stock collapsing in after-hours trading.Based on the $28 stock price in after hours, Yelp now trades at levels the stock originally bounced around at back in 2012 right after the IPO. The question is whether the stock deserves this harsh treatment, with reported Q2 revenue growing 51% and the following metrics since the IPO over three years ago. The numbers don't generally suggest a company in trouble.Source: Yelp Q2 earnings presentationThe biggest issue with the Yelp story remains the user metrics. The local consumer review site faces the major issue of having reduced metrics from consumers shifting to the mobile app. Currently, a consumer using a desktop computer at both work and home would count as two unique users. If the user throws in a smartphone search, suddenly Yelp counts the person as three users. Once the consumer shifts to the app, the person likely eliminates the desktop and mobile searches, thereby in some cases reducing the user count from two or three to only one.At the same time, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) algorithms in international locations are especially effective in preventing consumers finding Yelp via searches. This contributed to Yelp reporting a 1.2 million sequential user reduction in international locations despite growing the locations and consumer reviews.While the market is looking at these perplexing weak metrics, everybody is missing the growth ongoing in most other user metrics. The frustrating part is that Yelp has been slow to promote the app despite pointing out it was one of the original apps in the Apple App store back in 2008.As pointed out in the article, ""Yelp Has A Solution To The Google Problem"", the key to the future of Yelp is a focus on mobile and specifically the app. The app unique devices grew 51% in Q2, but the amount only sits at a relatively small 18.1 million. The company has a ton of potential to grow the app installs, and it is pushing $20 million into promoting the app and the brand in general in the 2H of the year. The marketing spend is up from only $10 million in the 1H when app uniques grew from 14.5 million to 18.1 million. A continuation or acceleration of that trend is very positive for the future of Yelp and more importantly the stock.The prime reason it matters, and the hope for the future, is that 70% of all activity in the quarter was via the mobile app. A couple of key metrics for the quarter were that page views, reviews/photos, and local account grew around 40% over last year. Viewed on those metrics alone, the business appears very healthy.Source: Yelp Q2 earnings presentationThe guidance though is where the market has major heartburn due to the decision to eliminate brand advertising. The quarterly amount has only averaged $8 million over the last year, but it is a sizeable chunk to immediately replace. The prime reason for eliminating the ads was to improve the customer experience with a focus on improving the load times on mobile. Considering the future is all mobile, the move seems smart, but it won't keep traders from crushing the stock based on the headlines.The company forecasts revenue still hitting roughly $550 million for the year, leaving the stock trading at only around 4x revenue estimates. If one believes the $1 billion guidance for 2017, the stock is down to only 2x revenue despite expectations of doubling revenues during that period.The general opinion is probably that Yelp can't reach that milestone, but investors need to keep in mind that international revenues only amount to 2% of the total in Q2 and transaction revenue from Eat24 is only starting to ramp. Don't forget that most of the key traffic metrics are growing 40%.The key takeaway is that Yelp has a lot to like, trading with an enterprise value below $2 billion and growing key metrics in the local advertising segment. Don't get caught up in the headline hysterics and instead use the dip below $30 to finally load up on the stock once it stabilizes. Don't buy the stock though until the lower lows trend is broken.The market currently likes the ""company is broken"" mantra without doing any real research. The stock won't rebound until this sentiment shifts. Long-term investors are encouraged to read the earnings call transcript for a more informed discussion of the prospects of Yelp. Those doing so will undoubtedly salivate at the opportunity to buy this local ad company at multi-year lows."

The company is still expecting significant growth.Looking at its valuation, long-term investors should be rewarded, much like NFLX a couple years back.","One of the hardest things for an investor to do is trade against the trend, buying a stock that's sharply lower, or shorting a high-flyer, thereby knowing more-than-likely that investment is going to suffer short term. However, those who are brave enough to do so and see something that the market has missed can be greatly rewarded. Yelp (NYSE:YELP) might be one such example.Yelp has fallen over 50% the last 12 months, and on top of that it is down another 25% in premarket hours following its second quarter earnings. But here's the thing: I have searched through its earnings report and guidance, and there is nothing that I consider all that ""bad.""Even with lower guidance, Yelp is still expecting revenue growth of about 37% in the coming quarter, over 25% if you exclude the acquisition of Eat24. While Yelp's brand ad sales have been a point of weakness in recent memory, the company is doing away with that business to focus on local ads for small and medium sized businesses that are advertising to customers in their area. This core local ad business remains strong, growing 43% during the quarter and accounting for over 80% of total sales.That said, I think Yelp is a truly misunderstood business. Over the last 16 months shareholder sentiment surrounding Yelp has declined rapidly, but with regard to the business itself I think Yelp has made itself stronger during this span. First and foremost, it is no longer just a review site. Today, Yelp allows customers to book tables or make reservations to restaurants/events from its site, and with the purchase of Eat24 it is now a competitor to GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), allowing customers to order takeout and delivery. Therefore, Yelp is diversifying its business, which is good.I suppose the biggest question surrounding Yelp is whether a review platform is sustainable, or even valuable, and the impact of new competition. Of course, I'm referring to the fact that both Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have become much more review friendly for small and local businesses over the last couple years. Therefore, as Yelp's guidance disappoints, there's a natural assumption that Yelp is not holding its ground against such competition. However, Yelp is unique in that it is very simple to search for businesses based on the service, location and then sort the results based on ratings. With Facebook, a user must search for a specific business, which thereby unveils its review. Yelp makes it very easy to find new things, as users often visit Yelp for ideas, and that's what makes its advertising services valuable.Furthermore, we live in a social society where reviews have become the number one source of determining a person's buying tendencies. A study by addthis.com determined that 45% of people were more likely to rely on reviews for big purchases like cars than other forms of marketing/advertising. In fact, the power of reviews to influence the consumer's buying habits has been studied and successfully linked on many instances.A Cone survey found that 80% of consumers will alter their purchase plans based on negative reviews, and that same survey found that 89% of consumers view reviews as trustworthy. In drawing a clear connection to Yelp's reviews, an assistant professor at Harvard found that each rating star on a Yelp restaurant review has a 5% to 9% sales impact on local, independent restaurants, thereby proving that reviews are very important to businesses.With that said, Yelp will never become the next Google or Facebook, but it is rather evident that there's a place for Yelp in the important business of online reviews. Not to mention, those local reviews that are so important to a business' revenue is where Yelp is strongest and is where Yelp is making itself stronger with food ordering, reservations, etc.With the stock down 25% to $25 the company is now valued at $1.6 billion. If Yelp reports revenue of $550 million this year then it would be trading at just 2.9 times this year's full-year sales. That's really cheap for a company that would be coming off a year with 45% top-line growth, much cheaper than the 15-20x sales multiple that social media, mobile and web based companies with similar growth trade at.To conclude, I will say that when stocks start going down with heavy momentum, it is really hard to determine how far they can fall. Back in August of 2011 I wrote an article calling for investors to buy Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) on a very similar decline. At the time, Netflix was just an $11.5 billion company. But if you look, Netflix's stock went on to decline another 50% short term before recovering. My point is that Yelp may keep going lower, it may go a lot lower, but the valuation looks attractive, growth remains robust, and there's a very good chance that investors will be rewarded long term who buy on the dip.See how Yelp ranks on Tipping the Scale."
3358245,67313,2015-07-27T23:56:17-04:00,"YELP has traded off as M&A speculation diminishes but M&A value is certainly there.Near-term weakness presents an attractive opportunity for long-term investors.Best positioned for the online-to-offline trend, which makes YELP an attractive target for Google, Apple, or Facebook.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) will report on Tuesday with consensus expecting $0.01 in EPS and $133m in revenue, +50% y/y. The stock has certainly traded off since media reported that the company is exploring a sale and now trading at a level before the speculation. Nonetheless, I still consider YELP to be best positioned for long-term growth in local advertising, specifically online-to-offline, as mobile payments take off. Long-term, M&A will remain part of YELP's story as large internet companies such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or even Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) look to incorporate YELP's database of local merchants with their mobile payment platforms to drive both ad and transaction revenue. The stock is down 37% since the beginning of the year but I believe the steady growth in the core business and potential M&A warrants YELP an attractive investment. Reiterate my bullish view on the stock.Near-term weakness expectedThe recent changes in Google's algorithm appear to be a primary factor in YELP's international growth over the recent quarters. More noticeably, the recent acquisitions of Restaurant Kritik and Cityvox do not appear to be benefiting from YELP's SEO that much. This could continue to weigh in on total unique user growth this quarter. On the bright side, app usage appears to be steady, grew at a respectable +47% y/y last quarter and we could see similar growth profile this quarter. Although local ad saw minor weakness last quarter, the product changes that took place last quarter could accelerate this segment and optimize pricing.Continue to see M&A value in YELPYelp is an attractive target given its database of merchants and the trend towards online-to-offline advertising. In the O2O model, merchant information and the mobile payment platform are two essential components. Here in North America, mobile payments have yet reach the scale similar to Asia where mobile messengers double up as a mobile wallet, such as the case with Tencent's WeChat and Naver's LINE messenger. However, I believe that as Google Wallet or Apple Pay ramps up, there is an incentive for either of these companies to control all aspects of the O2O value chain, including merchant information, map services and mobile payment.Looking at the comparable valuations in China, Dianping raised $850m that valued the company at $4.05b. Dianping is backed by Tencent, which already incorporate Dianping services in WeChat app. A better way to understand this concept would be including YELP services in Facebook Messenger in which users can look up restaurants, book the restaurant, purchase a couple via Facebook's own payment system. The convenience is evident and I believe it is a matter of time before this trend takes off in North America. That said, YELP is certainly well-positioned for this."

Who's buying? After a month, it is safe to say what company is not buying: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), to name a few of the bigger players. Rather than buy Yelp, Facebook and Google will expand the amount of content available through their channels, and reviews have already become part of their respective platforms. There has been plenty written about Yelp's business model, which is heavily reliant upon businesses advertising. The service industry relies upon perception of value, and part of that value is expressed in the service a customer receives. Yelp attempts to monetize this market with content, and the idea that users generate and/or use that content to make a decision, and so on. Advertisers with Yelp get insurance that they can manage their online reputation through the various platforms Yelp provides. Yelp has a tremendous sales force in comparison to revenue, and this is a concern for Wall Street. The numbers suggest that the company crushes it as far as revenue is concerned, quarter after quarter. However, slowing growth and rising costs have kept this product from taking off. And the cost of that revenue is enormous, and margins came in negative last quarter.Red and Yellow Flags: Insider selling, documentaries, numbers and downgrades in disguise.CEO Jeremy Stoppelman is selling his shares, no matter the price. Why wait for an offer? You can view a history of the millions of dollars Jeremy and other insiders have made selling Yelp stock since last August here.What happens to the placement of reviews, and the alleged ""strong-arming"" Yelp has been accused of with advertisers is a decision readers will have to come to themselves. Reputation is everything online, and regardless of your position, Yelp is beginning to feel this wrath. The company will now have to deal with the tag ""Billion-Dollar Bully."" As investors, it is important to consider the impact this movie may have. Perception means more than usual in the social media world.The NumbersInsufficient price earnings data. I know most bulls will tell you that you cannot ""price"" these kinds of equities because of the social media explosion, but it is obvious analysts cannot get a grasp as to estimates. There is just too much speculation, and growing doubt, on Wall Street as to what kind of revenue Yelp can generate, and how much that revenue will cost to generate, and most importantly, how much of the revenue will turn into actual profit. In that last four weeks, 22 analysts have dropped price targets, and 8 analysts have upgraded Yelp. The mean price target just keeps dropping like there's no tomorrow. Any speculation of an offer to buy Yelp seems to be already priced into the stock. A look at the analyst activity these past few months seems to confirm that Wall Street just has no idea how to value Yelp.May-18-15Downgrade Piper Jaffray Overweight →Neutral $70 → $46May-08-15ReiteratedDeutsche BankBuy$51 → $56Apr-30-15ReiteratedWunderlichBuy$90 → $75Apr-30-15ReiteratedUBSNeutral$51 → $48Apr-30-15ReiteratedSun Trust Rbsn HumphreyBuy$70 → $52Apr-30-15ReiteratedOppenheimerOutperform$76 → $60Apr-30-15ReiteratedNeedhamBuy$80 → $55Apr-30-15ReiteratedDeutsche BankBuy$71 → $51Apr-30-15ReiteratedCantor FitzgeraldBuy$78 → $68Apr-30-15ReiteratedAxiom CapitalHold$48 → $42Apr-30-15Downgrade RBC Capital MktsOutperform → Sector Perform$82 → $50Apr-30-15Downgrade Northland Capital Market Perform → Under Perform$49 → $35Apr-30-15Downgrade BofA/MerrillBuy → NeutralApr-22-15ReiteratedBrean CapitalBuy$50 → $58Feb-11-15UpgradeBrean CapitalHold → Buy$50Feb-11-15ReiteratedOppenheimerOutperform$73 → $76Feb-11-15ReiteratedNorthland CapitalMarket Perform$55 → $49Feb-11-15ReiteratedCRT CapitalBuy$63 → $62Feb-09-15ReiteratedMKM PartnersBuy$86 → $65Feb-06-15ReiteratedWunderlichBuy$105 → $90Source FinvizSome analysts, for some reason or other, are keeping their buy/outperform thesis, but price targets are dropping fast and furious. Wunderlich reiterated a buy twice in three months, dropping the price target each time. What happens when the stock price keeps dropping because no buyers have stepped up? If you look at Yelp this past year, you will see a broken chart, and that announcement was a temporary bump in a long road of decline. This Yelp chart reminds me of some wise Peter Lynch quotes on the subject of silliest things investors say: ""If it's gone down this much already, it can't go much lower,"" or ""You can always tell when a stock's hit bottom."" Apparently some of these analysts cannot yet tell when.Now how can we value Yelp? At current levels, $44, Yelp's market cap is $3.33 billion. If you need to know some ratios: that comes out to roughly 90x forward earnings and 139x trailing earnings. And these are the numbers after the rapid decline in stock price the past two years. So what can we buy for that amount of money instead?Conclusion: Final GradesWhen price targets drop like Yelp's has, investors must pay attention to what Wall Street is telling them, despite some bullish analysts who can't keep up with the price decline. The product: D-. I know this may sound heavy-handed, but the barrier to entry in the online review business is nil, just ask shareholder's of Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI). Reputation is everything online, and the Yelp model is under pressure. I can get a restaurant opinion anywhere, especially when I travel: as long as I can talk to a person, in person. The company: D. And I am giving them the benefit of the doubt here. Yelp won some important cases in court regarding clients paying for better ratings and anonymous users. But the company put itself up for sale, and still no buyers have stepped up at current levels. This whole affair smells funny, especially considering the company is virtually free of long-term debt. The Numbers: F, insufficient price earnings data. I don't award stocks with incompletes. I cannot see a viable, profitable business model, only revenue coming and going at alarming rates. When the company makes verifiable profits then it can be valued. Right now valuation numbers are unmentionable, and profit margin is dismal with no end in sight. As always, the final grade gives 25% weight to each the product, and company, and 50% weight to the numbers.Final Grade: D- leaning towards F.I'm on the fence here because Yelp is hard to value. You must remember that the market is irrational, and Yelp could sell for $3 billion. I just want a bull to let me know who is buying? Is Yelp an asset play? The grading system employed here may feel irrational, and it is. But the product is so un-compelling and out-of-touch with the restaurant business and clientele it attempts to exploit. The ""perceived value"" business owners signed on for with Yelp is now deteriorating, and those business owners are pulling the plug. Wall Street sniffed this out a year and a half ago. Don't believe me? Look at Yelp's chart. The EQ in this case is just too easy to answer: stay away. Upcoming catalysts include earnings (estimates vary greatly), the documentary, and no buyers in a shaky, top-heavy, M&A happy market. Investors wishing to short the stock should understand the risks involved, and remember: shorts are not for everyone. Be advised, and be careful! Dangerous waters."
3302325,22148,2015-07-05T12:10:01-04:00,"Yelp decides to take itself off the sales block sending the stock down 10%.The consumer review site is no longer expensive after a major collapse in the stock this year.Yelp is still failing to significantly improve user growth based on mobile app downloads, suggesting the stock will struggle in the short term.","In not such a surprising move, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) failed to find a buyer willing to pay up for the consumer review site. Though no details exist on any offers or whether any existed at all, the likelihood all along was that Yelp would fail to find a buyer willing to pay for the potential of the site.The stock plunged over 10% on the news that the CEO founder has decided to halt the sales process, sending the stock to new lows. Yelp ironically fell below where it traded before the spike on the news of hiring Goldman Sachs to explore a transaction.While frustrating seeing the stock slump to new lows, actual investors instead of traders exiting the position do not need to panic.No Longer ExpensiveFirst and foremost, the stock is no longer irrationally expensive. The stock is down close to 60% from the peak at nearly $87 while revenue is growing 50% this year. With the drop to $38, Yelp only trades at an enterprise value of $2.5 billion. Analysts forecast the company generating revenue of over $766 million next year so the stock trades at a very reasonable EV of 3.3x revenues.An analyst at Topeka Capital Markets assigned the stock a $60 target only a week ago. Blake Harper sees the ability of the company to close the engagement loop and the YP partnership as catalysts.Even the relatively negative Gene Munster from Piper Jaffray set a price target on Yelp of $46. His analysis suggests a potential sales price of $60, but the analyst thought the potential exists for an eventual acquisition at the target price.Either way, the stock was reasonably valued before the selloff. Yelp is now cheap after the selloff.User Growth IssueThe number one reason a deal likely failed to materialize at acceptable terms is the user engagement issue. An acquirer probably was unwilling to pay up for the stock until that issue is resolved while the CEO views the issue as temporary in nature.As highlighted in the article ""Does Yelp Need Help?"" the ultimate resolution to the issue is getting consumers to download and engage directly in the mobile app. Though the company highlighted that this metric grew roughly 50% YoY in Q1, Yelp has failed miserably to turn this into a material number. The latest quarter ended with only 16.0 million unique devices using the mobile app.According to the daily download ranks from App Annie, the Yelp app is still struggling with improved downloads. The app sits at number 42 overall in the U.S. on the iPhone, a number that slightly trails the levels of last summer.Source: App AnnieThe prime reason the mobile app is the key to the future of Yelp is that it allows the company to avoid the pitfalls of search queries where Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) sends consumers to internal review services and limits the exposure of Yelp. Despite having the premier consumer review site for local businesses like restaurants and bars, the service has failed to market and brand itself in that manner, making it still reliant on Google searches for traffic.With the company recently entering the Philippines, Yelp is now in 32 international markets. The Q1 international unique visitors sit at only 31.1 million suggesting Yelp only attracts one million uniques per international market. A consumer review site with global ambitions needs substantially greater scale to corner the market.TakeawayThough it seemed clear from the beginning that corporations looking for growth in user engagement would be unwilling to pay up for Yelp, the market sent the stock soaring. Investors shouldn't panic with the 10% drop.The company is better served by ramping up users before attempting a sale. The stock is now relatively cheap compared to the growth rate trading at an EV of 3.3x forward sales. Unfortunately, the stock is likely to struggle in the short term until the company improves the download rate of the app to bypass Google. Regardless, the long-term opportunity is too enormous to give up on the company and the wealth of user information it has already amassed."
3223776,21262,2015-05-30T08:12:07-04:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is for sale, and the news has generated the usual, now-tiresome lists of potential buyers: Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Yahoo (YHOO), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). It's like all the money in the business world slid off one end of the table and sluiced down to Silicon Valley. Forget the old spend-a-week-without-the-Internet experiments; is it possible to spend a week without talking about one of those companies?Speculation has it that the asking price of $3.5 billion might be too rich for any of those players, or anyone else. Yelp's audience is still growing - up 7.5 percent year-over-year to 142.5 million in the first quarter - but its revenue and audience growth is slowing. Total revenue will come in at about $580 million this year. It's lost 40 percent of its market cap in less than a year, as investors have decided it's lost its growth mojo.I've got a modest idea, especially if one of the digital behemoths won't bite: News companies should buy Yelp and use it as the foundation of the next generation of local news and information sites and apps. Before we get to the particulars of how that might happen, let's think about the role of Yelp and what it tells us about the persistent funk in which local news companies now wallow.Yelp stands out in our digital universe. It is a go-to smartphone app that's local. Check your smartphone right now. How many of the two dozen or so apps on it can claim localness? Sure, the weather app provides local weather, and the trusty MLB app serves up news and videos of your local team, but how many of the other apps are local at all? But does any local newspaper company or broadcast station claim first-screen status? Local so far is a smartphone disaster, even as the world and readers move profoundly mobile. Yes, mobile browsers do push local readers to the websites of local newspapers, no matter how subpar and middlingly responsive the experience may be. However, engagement rates - time on session and sessions per month - remain low. Why? In part, they are all about reading, not doing.Yelp, on the other hand, is all about local - local access, local to-dos, local usage. Founder Jeremy Stoppelman started Yelp in 2004, seeing the value of such a local utility as newspaper publishers and local broadcast execs focused on migrating their news content from print systems onto the World Wide Web. Stoppelman saw what was right under local media's noses: People want help living their lives, and those lives are local. Yelp's prime function was increasing the value of local information.Yelp first got traction in its native Bay Area, and I recall being astounded at how useful it was to separate the omnipresent restaurant chaff of San Francisco from the gems. We'd use Yelp, which already had achieved critical mass, discount the few predictable lunatic reviews, and find great places. Restaurant reviews in the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Jose Mercury News found themselves lapped in quantity, freshness, and sometimes quality.Those newspaper reviews had been the local standard for decades, reviews that were then multiplied in their power by old-fashioned word of mouth. That's of course what the web, and Yelp, did: multiply word of mouth many times over. Just as newspapers replaced the town crier, whose word was once spread around villages, Yelp replaced newspapers for restaurant reviews, and eventually services of many kinds.Flash forward to today: Yelp now can't produce the kind of growth it needs within its digital category. Local news and information companies, a.k.a. newspapers and soon local broadcasters, have become less and less relevant to the daily lives of their readers and viewers, as smartphone utility connects people to local maps, sales, events, and more.So the idea: Marry the Yelp platform to a nationally used news platform, able to be customized locally. Reestablish the connection between daily (now hourly and instantaneous) news and life lived in cities. Reconnect local services, restaurants, and retail with the news.Close your eyes for a moment and think about being welcomed back to a world that the daily newspaper neatly created and served (so profitably for owners and satisfyingly for readers and advertisers) for decades until the great digital rupture. That rupture: The package of news, advertising, and things-to-do split asunder by digital disruption from classifieds (Craigslist, eBay, Monster, etc.), Google search, and now Facebook social.Why stop there? Add other highly useful apps to the mix - likely through partnership. Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI) for household services. OpenTable for restaurant reservations. Uber and other ride-sharing services for transportation. A Yelp acquisition would already include Eat24, the restaurant takeout company Yelp bought in February for $134 million, and the online reservation service SeatMe.Okay, so who's going to get the ball rolling and put in a $3 billion bid?It could be one of the big rollup newspaper chains - Gannett (NYSE:GCI), New Media Investment (GateHouse), or Tribune Publishing (TPUB). Any of them would require a private equity partner, which New Media already has in Fortress (NYSE:FIG). How about Apollo Global Management (NYSE:APO), whose talks to buy Digital First Media have apparently broken off?DFM, in and of itself, is a turnaround and a headache - at any price. DFM, as a first rock of a national/local-news/information/city guide/review-site operation, would be a whole different proposition.How would the numbers pencil out? Well, that would depend on the ability of local companies - whoever owned them - to monetize local audiences. I've talked to a number of publishers recently who talk vaguely about adding e-commerce to their business models. A Yelp-infused publishing platform would completely change the game of what's possible, how much audience and engagement can be gained, and how much new money can be made. Publishers could connect one of their biggest growth initiatives - digital marketing services - to the Yelp mix.Certainly, $3 billion is a lot of money, but let's recall the three billionaires that have bought into the daily newspaper business recently. Imagine what John Henry's Boston Globe, Glen Taylor's Minneapolis Star-Tribune, or Jeff Bezos's Washington Post might be able to do with such Yelp-enhanced platform. Could a network, owned or partnered, make it work?Of course, it's Bezos who would be the wild card, given his wealth, standing, and outside-the-box thinking. We've all been waiting for the next Washington Post shoe to drop, which would mean a bolt-from-the-blue new business model for local news companies. Further, consider many advantages of a possible Amazon/Yelp tie-up, particularly with Amazon's strong interest in superfast local delivery.Many others may have the money and imagination to make such a move. Perhaps Verizon (NYSE:VZ), in its quest to be a media company (""Nine takeaways from the Verizon-AOL Deal""), could double-down with a Yelp and match its GPS-leading smarts with local media and services. Many an entrepreneur could see how it could work, but we'd hope to find one with respect for (local) news values and the ability to renew them in the digital age.How should a potential buyer think of a Yelp acquisition? The first logical question: Why buy a stalled Internet company that the market is now devaluing? First, its price is declining, so it becomes a better buy over time. Most importantly, it isn't Yelp's current financials that would matter most strategically. The big question: What happens if you combine the current engagement and revenue power of Yelp with that of the strongest local media players, with huge digital audiences and sales forces? Finally, what's the financial return of reorienting local digital news franchises into local digital news/city guide businesses, reclaiming for another era newspapers' longtime place in the community?"
3209656,78265,2015-05-26T18:17:11-04:00,"Since we first posted a negative piece on Yelp, the shares are down just shy of 12%. We thought we'd look at it again to see if it's worth buying.Well, it's not.The shares remain optimistically priced, and the company earns less on capital than it costs to raise capital. Continue to avoid Yelp.","We wanted to revisit Yelp (NYSE:YELP) since posting about it last December. We recommended readers avoid the shares, and the company is down 11.5% since then, handily underperforming the S&P 500. We thought we'd take the opportunity to look in on the company again to see if we should change polarity from generally bearish to neutral or even bullish. We'll go through this exercise by comparing assumptions embedded in the price with the current metrics at the firm. We'll also review the relationship between the weighted average cost of capital and the returns on that capital. If the returns are lower than the costs, financial loss is the inevitable result. We'll spare readers with short attention spans the suspense: this remains a company to avoid. We outline our logic below.Reverse-engineering PriceOne of the first things we want to do with a potential stock investment is work out the assumptions the market currently has about the company. If the assumptions are too optimistic, we tend to shy away from the shares (because, in our experience, optimists in public markets have a terrible habit of being disappointed). We note the following about this company:Price is $46.48Forward P/E is 61.4 (EPS forecast $.75)Current P/E is 95 (EPS now $.49)Holding price constant, this means that the market is expecting a CAGR of 54.5% in EPS over the next year. A company of this sort growing its earnings 54.5% in a year isn't this crazy, but it's unrealistic, in our view. For that reason, we'd characterize these shares as being optimistically priced (which is a reason to avoid them).Return on Invested CapitalThe next thing we want to do is work out how much the company earns on the capital that it has invested, and compare that return to what it costs to raise that capital. The fact that Yelp has no debt makes it easier to go through with this exercise. The first thing we need to do is derive the net-tax twelve months of operating cash flow and compare that with the cost of capital.Over the past 12 months, the operating income for Yelp was $11,000,000. The tax situation is atypical for this company (note that for the period ending December 31, 2014, that operating income was ~$11 million and the company enjoyed an income tax benefit of ~$25 million). Given our personal experiences with tax authorities, we doubt this will be an ongoing situation, and therefore, we'll strip out the impact of taxes. The fact that the company paid only ~$1 million in tax over the previous four years suggests to us that tax isn't a significant issue for the foreseeable future. It is therefore not likely to make a big difference in our calculation of NOPAT (net operating profit after tax).Whenever we compare income statement values to balance sheet values, we need to average current balance sheet values with the year-ago period. The reason for this is simply that income statement figures represent a year-long period, while balance sheet figures capture a ""picture"" of a company's financial position at a moment in time (theoretically). Therefore, the standard is for us to average balance sheet figures. We want to use book value figures for debt and equity, because that is the amount of capital the company actually received. The fact that there's no debt simplifies the exercise.The book value of equity in March of 2015 was $656 million, and the book value of equity in March of 2014 was ~$500 million. Therefore, the average book value of equity is $578 million. Thus, the return the company makes on its invested capital is:$11,000,000 / $578,000,000 = 1.9%So the company has received ~$578 million of capital, and on that capital, it's made an operating return of 1.9% over the past year. The next step in our process is to compare the returns on this capital with the cost of that capital. If the costs of raising capital exceed the returns made on that capital, economic loss is the result. Put another way, if investors can achieve better risk-adjusted returns on capital elsewhere, they're better off avoiding this name in favour of one that makes decent returns on capital.The Weighted Average Cost Of CapitalBecause there is no debt on Yelp's balance sheet, the process of working out the weighted cost of capital is quite simplified. We don't need to worry about weightings or the tax shield. One hundred percent of the capital is funded with equity investments. How much does that ""cost?"" We ask because investors who invested capital to Yelp had alternative ways to use their capital (consume it, invest it in risk-free assets, other stocks etc.). This cost, among others, needs to be captured. In order to figure out the cost of capital, we'll use the capital asset pricing model (or CAPM), beloved by all who have encountered it. For those who haven't yet had the pleasure, the formula is:Rf + B (Me-Rf)Where Rf = the risk-free rate; in this case, a 10-year US government treasury. B = the beta of the stock relative to the S&P 500. The difference between Me and Rf is the market risk premium, which is the return expectation an investor demands to buy the market over and above the risk-free rate. We, at Doyle Publishing, demand an 8% return for taking on the risk of buying stocks, so Me for us = 8%. Investors are encouraged to put in their own risk requirements.At the moment, the 10-year government bond is 2.2145%, so the only thing left is to work out beta.We've heard it said that calculating beta is as much an art as it is a science. Calling anything having to do with beta ""art"" is perverse, in our view, but we'll grant that there is an imprecision to the exercise. Specifically, we normally need to go back far enough in time to have a sample of data of sufficient size to be robust, but we can't go back so far that our sample data isn't relevant. Luckily, Yelp's only been a public company since March of 2012, so this is largely a non-issue in this case. The mechanics of how to work out beta are here.When we ran the beta calculation over this company's short history as a public company, we calculated it to be ~1.7.Therefore, the cost of equity for this company is 2.2145% + 1.7 (8-2.2145) = 12%ConclusionWe get nervous when we see a company with costs of capital in the neighbourhood of 12% and returns on that capital of 2%, because it's such a wide and negative spread. The math may be imprecise (it certainly is when we use CAPM, beta and the like). We are open to a charge of comparing apples and oranges, because one set of numbers (operating profit and book value of equity) is rooted in GAAP accounting (GOOD), and the costs of capital are derived from the magic that is the capital asset pricing model (?).That said, it's obvious that a large pile of capital has been invested in this company, and that the latest operational figures are such that the returns on that capital underperform the risk-free rate by a significant margin. We can quibble about the math, but it's plain that when a company (with all the risk that entails) has returns that are less than what an investor can receive simply buying a 10-year bond, it is making returns that could only be characterized as poor. Couple that with the fact that the shares are currently optimistically priced, and we have a recipe for (continued) disaster. After revisiting this name, we reiterate our earlier view. Avoid Yelp."
3174986,87986,2015-05-12T13:19:47-04:00,Fundamentals do matter.So does valuation and differentiation.Installment #1: YELP.,"The short answer is yes… but not from the perspective that most people think. I'm not suggesting that valuations are on par with those of 2000 and I'm not talking about the entire sector by any means but there are pockets of absurdity out there today. The issue, from my perspective, is the quality of the companies. Simply put, we've got a lot of products and/or services masquerading as companies. I've seen this movie before and it doesn't end well.This is something that has been developing in the back of my mind for some time as we've seen the steady parade of IPOs roll off the assembly line that is Wall Street. OK, so what am I talking about?Let's take Yelp (NYSE:YELP) as our first example. This 2012 IPO could be a poster child for the new breed of S-1 filings. It used all the appropriate buzz-words of the period: passionate community, network-effects, platform, proprietary technology et al. They gave us ""cohorts"" as a demonstration of their market success over time. They saw their stock soar to more than $101/share after a series of high-60% year-year growth quarters and, at that point, outperforming the DJ Technology Index by more than 400%. That translated to a P/E on FY15 consensus estimates of 727x. But it's all come crashing down as YELP has seen its top-line growth deteriorate in recent quarters with the expectation that it falls into the high-40% range in Q2/15. Now we're only (sarcasm intended) looking at a P/E of 97x on FY16 consensus.When I look at this company I see a service provider delivering information about local businesses. Sounds admirable enough but how many others are doing exactly the same thing either directly competing with YELP or doing something eerily similar in an adjacent space? Think about it, why are they so much different than Zagat or OpenTable or for that matter Angie's List or Home Advisor? Why is YELP going to be a winner and worth a triple-digit multiple?Now that they've stumbled we've had the prerequisite Wall Street Journal gossip that they're exploring strategic options with investors drinking the Kool-Aid to the tune of +24%. Hey, I've been around long enough to never say ""never"" but how'd that work out for Rackspace (NYSE:RAX) or BlackBerry (BBRY) or any number of others?Before you decide it's time to jump in the pool understand a few things. First, this company's operating expenses are out of control. In the trailing twelve months ending March 30, 2015, YELP's S&M spend is 52% of revenue with G&A at 15% (Source: company reports). Those are absurd numbers and neither is expected to decline very much anytime soon. I understand the land-rush argument that young companies need to establish a broad footprint as quickly as possible. But when Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) are spending 12-13% and 8-9% on their respective expenses (Source: company reports) during the same period something is wrong. Let me offer up two observations on the subject:Management also claims to be making a push internationally. That's certainly a legitimate goal. However, why has international revenue been stuck between $2.4-$3.3 million for the last nine quarters and in three of the last five quarters revenue actually declined? In Q1/15 international revenue growth was 33% (estimated at 57% in constant currency) so why was international traffic essentially flat?The risk you run today is that top-line growth continues to slow and with that process the stock continues to head south. However, if they re-accelerate that process or a buyer appears then I'm wrong. My experience tells me the former is unlikely to happen and the latter may but not at the current 10x sales.Some of you will certainly argue that I just don't understand or that it's different with this name. I understand one thing; investing is about making money and that hasn't changed over time. Fundamentals are what they say they are and no amount of IPO jargon will change that. Every company will have short-term excursions from the norm but no one lives on the edge indefinitely. If you can't look at a company, assess what makes it unique and see how that quality translates into its fundamentals, it's usually because they're not."
3170516,76785,2015-05-11T15:51:37-04:00,"Yelp's valuation remains high, net income light.Possible suitors coming off big deals in 2014 are unlikely to attempt another so quickly.Shopping around may signal management's lack of confidence in the company going forward.","I'm willing to go on the record here that Yelp (NYSE:YELP) won't get a buyout deal done. And today, I will be reopening my short position I closed after the most recent earnings release, which by all accounts was not strong. Slowing user growth and back to reporting a quarterly loss does not make for a good report. I don't blame them for shopping around, and doing so should be a sign to investors that even management isn't sure that it can stand on its own.Trading for around $40/share before the rumors, Yelp now trades near $50/share. I'm going to assume the market is 50/50 on a deal taking place, putting the expected value of the deal at around $60/share, or nearly $4B. What are the main reasons this won't take place?Valuation, Balance Sheet ImpactsInvestors have to face the facts of the high multiples that Yelp trades at and how that impacts what a potential suitor will be acquiring. At a $4B valuation, an acquirer would be paying 150 times EV/EBITDA and 7x guided revenue for 2015. There isn't any doubt that Yelp has shown it can grow its revenue and expand its user base, but in any world, even the high flying tech world of late, that's expensive.Yelp does have a clean balance sheet with very few liabilities and no long-term debt. That by itself makes it an attractive target. There is, however, one major problem. The company, excluding goodwill and intangibles, had only $441M in net current assets as of the end of last quarter. An acquirer at a $4B valuation would be booking $3.6B in goodwill to its balance sheet. Top C-suite management isn't naive. It isn't rocket science to at least be aware that the technology sector in general is looking a little toppy and blistering M&A activity has pushed up valuations in general. Nobody wants the next Autonomy (Hewlett Packard's $8.8B goodwill impairment debacle) or aQuantive (Microsoft's $6.2B goodwill impairment charge) on their hands.Possible BuyersThere are five main potential suitors that would have the highest probability of pursuing interest in Yelp, according to most analysts. Those five would be Priceline (PCLN), Yahoo (YHOO), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Grubhub (NYSE:GRUB).Facebook is an unlikely suitor, even with the cash on hand to make a bid. While Mark Zuckerberg has had a penchant for high profile acquisitions and the company has put forth its own platform for competing with Yelp, showing the company's interest in the environment, the fact of the matter is Facebook is just coming off the heels of the $19B WhatsApp acquisition, an expensive acquisition the company paid for mostly with stock. This transaction catapulted Facebook's own held goodwill on its balance sheet to $22B, more than 50% of current assets. The company already has plenty on its plate with its entrance into the payments sphere, so look for Facebook to continue to focus its concentration there.Google bid for Yelp back in 2009 for $550M, and there are clear synergies that could be put into play with Google Maps and its own local advertising push. But given the clear distaste both management teams have for each other that has built for years, I have significant doubts that a deal will take place. Given Yelp's consistent complaints about how it is placed in Google's search platform, in many cases pointedly blaming weakness on Google, there's very little chance of a deal being made here.GrubHub is an obvious fit, especially as a mold-in with Yelp's recent Eat24 acquisition. But I don't think the company can raise the capital necessary from lenders. The two combined companies would not have the cash flow generation to support the long-term debt even in this interest rate environment, and a stock issuance would have to more than double the company's outstanding float. Grubhub's management isn't going to take that big of a risk - it has enough of a job on its own keeping its own operations in favor with the Street.Yahoo has long been touted as a potential suitor for Yelp. The company has enjoyed its fresh cash from the Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) IPO for a while now, and it was apparently uninterested in Yelp at higher prices. Marissa Meyer has long been a target of activist investors like Starboard Value for overspending on acquisitions, so don't look for her to paint a fresh target on her back now after appeasing the hedge fund with share buybacks. With Yahoo's plans for those buybacks to continue (and with $10B in stock retired since 2012), management has chosen their course for that cash.Priceline is going to be the most likely (but still unlikely) suitor here in my opinion. Yelp's bread and butter has always been restaurant reviews, and a tie-in with Priceline's OpenTable business on paper would yield some synergies and cross-selling advantages. The businesses even have an existing revenue-share relationship. But fresh off the OpenTable acquisition in 2014, I don't think the company is going to want to further expand into the space just yet. OpenTable also was by far a more profitable venture. Priceline paid about 55x OpenTable's projected next year's earnings when they were bought out by Priceline. Even at current prices, Yelp trades at nearly 100x forward earnings.ConclusionYelp, to me, is in trouble. It hasn't been able to translate its top-line growth into a meaningful amount of net income. Shopping itself around is most likely a smart move, even if the price may come in well below where the company traded under a year ago which will upset some shareholders. But most of the big companies in the technology space that might be interested are coming off of multi-billion dollar deals in 2014 and are unlikely to be interested in a company at a big valuation that hasn't proven itself to be able to be accretive to the acquirer's own bottom line."
3159406,40351,2015-05-08T09:29:06-04:00,"Yelp is reportedly working with Goldman Sachs to explore a sale.The company has reported three bad quarters, but that might not be the reason for sale.There are at least eight possible buyers, but two appear most logical.","Shares of Yelp (NYSE:YELP) popped by 23% yesterday following a report from WSJ that the consumer review website was ""exploring a sale."" Yelp is now reportedly working with Goldman Sachs to find possible suitors. Yelp was founded in 2004 by Jeremy Stoppelman and Russ Simmons, former executives at PayPal (NASDAQ:EBAY), and with support from Max Levchin, PayPal's founder who injected $1 million into the startup. It quickly grew on the back of a growing community of active users. In 2009, Yelp got Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) attention. The search engine giant made a $500 million takeover offer which was rejected by Stoppelman. Three years later, Yelp went public in a $100 million IPO which valued the company at $900 million. Following the latest rally, Yelp is now priced at $3.5 billion with an enterprise value of $3.4 billion. Clearly, Yelp has come a long way in a very short time, but it has lost its steam.Possible reasonThe last few quarters have been rough for Yelp due to growing concerns about the company's sluggish growth of active user base. This has led to double-digit drops in the company's shares following the release of earnings report in the last three quarters. In its latest quarterly results, for instance, Yelp reported just 8% increase in monthly unique visitors to 143 million - that's significantly lower than the growth of 30% a year earlier and 13% in the prior quarter. There were some other concerns as well, such as the programmatic advertising which was hurting the brand advertising revenues. It is, however, unlikely that just three bad quarters would have forced the company's management to seriously reconsider the future of Yelp as a stand-alone company. On the contrary, in the previous conference call, the management sounded quite optimistic about the company's long-term prospects. Despite the slowdown, the management reiterated their resolve to achieve $1 billion in annual revenues by 2017. The company has also been out expanding its workforce over the last twelve months, which is evident in the 50% increase in its headcount to 3,000 employees -- that's something which a company that is trying to sell itself would rarely do.Therefore, I believe that Yelp is likely looking for buyers because it has received an offer, not because of its poor performance over the last three quarters. A buyer will get access to the company's 147 million monthly active users as well as its brand. Possible buyers could be companies that generate their revenues from digital advertising, other local review and travel companies, e-commerce companies or even international players who are looking to expand their foothold in the U.S. With these four categories in mind, one can easily draw a list of potential buyers which would include Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google, Yahoo (YHOO), TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), Priceline (PCLN), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), China's Alibaba Group (NYSE:BABA) and Japan's Rakuten (OTCPK:RKUNY).Probable buyersSeveral analysts, including Jefferies' Brian Pitz and Piper Jaffray's Gene Munster have said that Google could be the most likely buyer, but I believe that it's unlikely. The two companies share a not-so-friendly history. Yelp, as well as other companies, has filed complaints with U.S. and European regulators against Google, claiming that the search engine behemoth was using its dominant position to highlight its own services in the internet search at the detriment of its competitors. At that time, Google's Google+ Local competed directly with Yelp. An interesting thing about Yelp's complaint with the European regulator was that it was filed at a time when Google was nearing the conclusion of the decade-long anti-trust investigations on Google's search practices. Although the U.S. regulators found nothing wrong in Google's practices, the Europeans weren't convinced.I believe the most likely U.S. based buyer could be Facebook. The social networking giant is known for buying out competitors instead of spending its cash, time and energy to develop a similar product on its own. This was evident in the $19 billion acquisition of WhatsApp. Over the last few years, Facebook has been working on products that compete directly with Yelp, but it hasn't really been successful.When it comes to non-U.S. based players, Alibaba appears to be the most logical buyer. Yelp could be Alibaba's short cut to gaining significant exposure to the local U.S. market, particularly the small and medium sized businesses. Moreover, Alibaba has been under pressure over the last few months, losing nearly $90 billion in market cap, due in part to concerns related to growing competition and the government's crackdown on the sale of counterfeit goods on Alibaba sites. But the company has recently introduced the new CEO Daniel Zhang to regain the lost momentum, and a major U.S. acquisition could do just that."
3051516,67313,2015-04-06T22:52:23-04:00,"Recent investment in Dianping and Meituan highlight the strategic value behind YELP and GRPN.Tencent and BABA are keen on group-buy and user reviews to enhance their ecosystems.YELP and GRPN could be attractive targets to FB, AAPL and GOOG as they strengthen their own ecosystems.","Last week, one of China's user review/group-buy sites, Dianping, raised (WSJ subscription required at link) $850m from a group of investors including Xiaomi that values the company at $4.05b. In addition to Xiaomi, Dianping is also backed by Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), which incorporates Dianping in its WeChat messenger platform so a user can conveniently look up and share a restaurant or a point of interest with friends. The latest deal comes after rival Meituan, which is backed by Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), raised $700m from a group of investors. I see this to be a positive for both BABA and Tencent. I see this to be a positive to Tencent as Dianping could use the additional capital to expand its footprint to offer users more relevant points of interest. This also bodes well for Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) in that when both business models are combined, there is significant strategic value for the larger internet companies that are looking to reinforce its ecosystem. I reiterate my bullish view on Tencent, BABA, YELP and GRPN on the back of this news.YELP + GRPN = Strategic ValueFor those who are not familiar with Dianping, it is modeled after YELP and GRPN in that a user can look up reviews on various points of interest and purchase a group-buy discount from the site. Dianping is the perfect example of a proven O2O business model and its recent financing suggests that the O2O market will continue to see robust growth driven by higher mobile usage and that those players that have scale and brand equity will likely to come out to be the winner. Clearly, Dianping has proven this point.The recent growth of O2O sites in China raises several possibilities including YELP moving into group-buy to enhance the stickiness of its platform. While it could face short-term losses, long-term implication is attractive as seen by the growth of Dianping, which has over 190m active users and covers over 12m businesses. By moving into group-buy, YELP can further solidify its positioning as the go-to site for local user review and O2O transactions.An alternative possibility is a potential partnership or merger between YELP and GRPN, in which the partnership could have a virtual monopoly over the O2O space here in North America. This partnership could have strategic value to large internet companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) that are looking to strengthen its mobile ecosystem.Most likely, I believe Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) could be interested in acquiring YELP or GRPN given that it has been mimicking Tencent's strategy of building its mobile messenger platform. FB would deliver significant convenience to users should it decide to incorporate YELP and GRPN features into the messenger, as both have natural synergy with FB payment inside the messenger."
3078016,76475,2015-04-18T11:45:28-04:00,Yelp’s shares have continued to fall in the current year.Most of the company’s investors are concerned about the drastic slowdown in the company’s traffic growth.There are no significant tailwinds that can help Yelp reverse the situation which might mean its shares stay down for long.,"Business review site Yelp (NYSE:YELP), together with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Expedia (NYSE: EXPE), have been in the headlines lately as some of the companies that have been crying foul about Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) supposedly anti-competitive business practices. The EU has demonstrated its intent to bring Google to book after it recently slapped the search giant with a ''Statement of Objections,'' which could see Google fined as much as $6.6 billion. Yelp complained that Google favored its own results in search engine results placement, or SERP, which has been negatively affecting Yelp's traffic. In a way, this was an admission by Yelp that Google's search platform had a huge bearing on its business, probably more so than its own popular mobile app.In remediation, Google did a significant algorithm change mid-last year that gave better visibility to local directory sites such as Yelp in search results.Google Search on a Business on YelpBefore:Source: Search Engine LandAfterSource: Search Engine LandYelp shares have remained depressed for more than 12 months nowand have in fact tanked more than 40% since September mainly due to investor concerns about the company's slowing growth. It's not like Yelp's growth has suddenly hit a wall - on the contrary, the company's revenue surged 51% during the last quarter while EBITDA jumped 150%. But with a frothy valuation like Yelp's, investors are bound to nitpick every little detail for signs of trouble. Yelp has now managed to report a profit for three consecutive quarters, but this has largely been lost on its investors. The razor-thin earnings means that the company's shares sport a ridiculous PE ratio of several thousands. It appears Yelp investors are much more interested in growth than profits a la Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).Despite the impressive top and bottom line growth, investors were quick to point out that the company's full-year revenue growth of 56% was considerably lower than the previous year's reading of 72%. Cumulative review growth, which serve as a good measure of user engagement on the company's platform, declined from 47% the year before to 35%. The worst part is growth in the company's monthly unique visitors growth fell from 37% the year before to just 13%.The huge slowdown in the number of unique visitors makes you question the validity of the company's claims that Google's rankings had been playing havoc with its traffic. You would expect traffic growth to accelerate or, at the very least, to remain at its former level, now that Google had fixed the SERP problem. In the company's defense, its website receives 135 million unique visitors every month, so it could be a case of the law of large numbers catching up with the company. But, that argument does not hold much water when you consider that TripAdvisor (NASDAQ: TRIP), the world's largest travel review site, saw a healthy 21% growth in monthly unique visitors in 2014 to 315 million. I know this is more of an apples-to-oranges comparison because the two sites cater to different customers. But suggesting that Yelp's traffic growth is that close to hitting a plateau is enough to spook even the boldest investors.I'm one of the guys that firmly believed that Yelp's traffic would start growing at a healthy clip once Google changed its ranking algorithms, but apparently I was wrong.Poor Monetization Rates of International MarketsYelp has been expanding rapidly, which in normal circumstances would be a very good thing because it would mean a bigger addressable market and more revenue opportunities. The company now has a footprint in 29 countries around the world. But its monetization rates in these markets is just terrible. About 70% of Yelp's 76 million business listings are located in America and Europe with the rest located in developing economies. Out of the huge number of listed businesses, only 93,700, or less than 1%, are active on the site, meaning they contribute ad revenue to the company. What's particularly worrying is the fact that the average Yelp customer in the developed economies bring in about $5,500 in revenue per year while clients in other markets contribute just $380. This means that the company's international expansion efforts will do very little to grow the company's top line. I had written an article comparing social media companies Twitter (NYSE: TWTR) and LinkedIn (NYSE: LNKD) wherein I pointed out that one of Twitter's major problems was the fact that the average U.S. customer brings in 6 times as much revenue as the average international customer. Well, for Yelp the problem is far much worse since the ratio is close to 1:15.But that's not all. Rapid international expansion means that the company's sales and marketing expenses, the company's biggest line item accounting for more to 53% of revenue, will continue expanding rapidly and placing a lot of pressure on the company's bottom line. Yelp's sales and marketing expenses grew at a 52% clip in 2014, which is just too high.In the U.S. market, Yelp is likely to start facing competitive pressure from the likes of Amazon and Google, both of which have announced their intention to launch their own review services. Amazon has more than 230 million users and will leverage its Amazon Home Service business. I believe that its review business has the potential to gain traction very quickly.Bottom LineI do not see Yelp's growth problem easing off any time soon. I expected that the company's traffic growth would remain at a high level once Google changed its ranking algorithms but this has not happened. Moreover, Yelp's very high sales and marketing expense means that the company's bottom line can only be expected to expand slowly, which in turn means that the company will take much longer to grow into its stratospheric valuation than probably what many investors would be comfortable with. This looks like a perfect setup to keep the shares depressed for a long time."
3104016,27281,2015-04-27T05:27:40-04:00,"Following a substantial sell-off in Yelp's shares, I believe that the company's relative and absolute valuations appear low and upside potential from a takeover has increased.User growth rates for Yelp are slowing; however, monetization opportunities and revenue growth rates remain strong.Risks relating to a negative documentary about Yelp, which is now in production, appear low and I believe that competitive risks are now more than priced into Yelp's shares.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) shareholders have had a rough ride over the past year with shares down about 42% from their 52-week high (and recently down as much as 57% from their 14-month high). The reason for the decline has been attributed to disappointing earnings reports, declining user growth rates, and fears over a negative documentary that is in production (and related concerns over the integrity of Yelp's business model).As a value investor, big name internet companies like Yelp (with substantial growth priced into their shares) aren't in my usual hunting ground for value opportunities. Nonetheless, the substantial decline in Yelp's shares piqued my interest in Yelp and I began looking at the company's shares as a potential investment.Usually in these instances, my conclusion is that the sell-off was warranted and I move on. In this case, however, I concluded that concerns over Yelp's future are overdone and Yelp's shares now provide an inexpensive option on the company's ability to monetize their substantial user base and/or realize upside from a takeover.Image 1:Results Disappointed, Although Growth Trends Remain Very StrongShares in Yelp fell sharply after both the Q3 and Q4 2014 earnings reports as investors were concerned over Q4 guidance and, subsequently, over the decline in user growth rates reported in Q4. While overall growth and guidance was strong in both quarters, it was not strong enough to meet investors' expectations.For the most recent quarter ending December 31, 2014, Yelp reported a 35% year-over-year increase in reviews (to 71 million), a 37% increase in mobile unique visitors (to 72 million), and a 13% increase in monthly unique visitors (to 135 million).These are tremendous growth stats; however, expectations for Yelp are high and the shares are clearly speculative with a lot of growth already built into the share price. What seems to be of most concern to investors from the most recent quarterly report was the fact that monthly unique visitor growth declined from 40% in Q4 2013 to 13% in Q4 2014.While a decline in user growth is never desirable, I believe that the law of large numbers makes it inevitable and I believe that the real upside for Yelp is from monetization. In other words, I believe that Yelp's future is dependent on increasing revenues from their massive existing user base rather than sustaining the Q4 2013 user growth rate of 40% over the long term (a statistical impossibility from the huge current base of 135 million unique monthly visitors).As far as monetization is concerned, progress continues to be strong. Revenues were up 62% in 2014 (56% in the most recent quarter) and guidance implies revenue growth of 53% in 2015. Monetization trends are also improving considerably. As can be seen from the chart below, revenue growth relative to monthly unique visitor growth increased from 2.1x in Q4 2013 to 4.4x in Q4 2014. Revenue guidance of 53% for 2015 also implies that revenue and monetization growth trends are expected to continue to be very strong this year.Image 2:Documentary Risk Appears LowAnother negative development that has impacted Yelp's shares over the past two months has been relating to a ""kickstarter"" fundraising campaign for a documentary named ""Billion Dollar Bully."" Shares have since more than rebounded - after falling over 5% to lows of $44.34 on March 19th following news about the documentary - but these types of allegations still warrant addressing.The documentary alleges that Yelp bullies small businesses and effectively extorts money from them. This would, indeed, be a big problem if there was some truth to it. That said, I have seen no compelling evidence to support the allegations.The trailer for the film shows select business owners complaining about Yelp, including one business owner anecdotally describing how some good reviews for his business disappeared after he decided not to subscribe to Yelp's paid services. Sounds suspicious until you consider that, by mere coincidence, a company that facilitates 71 million reviews will have many instances of negative review developments coinciding with salesperson interaction.If extortion was proven and shown to be systemic activity by the company, you would have a good scandal and a good documentary. I've seen no such proof of this kind of systemic activity and, in fact, I've seen quite the opposite.A Harvard Business School study, published in the latter part of 2013, showed that the ratings of Yelp's advertising partners were no better than those of the non-paying businesses. In addition, a Federal Trade Commission (F.T.C.) inquiry, based on some complaints, was concluded earlier this year with no action being taken by the F.T.C. Finally, a class-action lawsuit against Yelp, alleging that they alter ratings for money, was dismissed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in September of 2014.While the results of the F.T.C. review and the class-action lawsuit support Yelp's defense against their critics, the complaints that spurred them do show that there are some disgruntled businesses out there. Of course, this means little, in and of itself, as any system that reviews other businesses will have disgruntled ""reviewees"" (many that cry unfairness or bias). In fact, I would argue that half of the businesses that are reviewed (those with ratings in the bottom half of their peer groups) are likely to be disgruntled.Apart from the unbiased evidence supporting Yelp, from the F.T.C., the H.B.S. study, and the U.S. Court of Appeals decision, a system of extortion intuitively makes no sense. The integrity of Yelp's reviews are of utmost importance and the legitimacy of the reviews are essential to people finding value in the system. To sacrifice the integrity of the system and the long-term survival of the business (for the purpose of short-term revenues) would make no sense.In order to maintain the integrity of the ratings, Yelp does use an algorithm to filter out suspicious (fake) reviews. The trailer for the documentary reflects this as suspicious and shady (with many interviewees showing shock and surprise that filtering actually happens). Far from being a shady practice, which reduces the integrity of the ratings, I believe that these filters do exactly the opposite.In fact, Yelp's algorithm tries to eliminate fake reviews and this is what actually makes their system worthwhile and one of the reasons why so many people go to the site. If there was no filter - and family and friends were able to inflate ratings with numerous biased reviews (and/or family and friends of competitors were able to do the opposite) - the reviews and business of Yelp would be worthless.Maybe the documentary will bring forward real evidence (beyond a few anecdotal comments and the yet to be substantiated sound bites of the trailer) to support their allegations. I'm doubtful, but I can't say that it isn't possible. As with any conspiracy theory, I can't prove a negative and I can only say that I haven't seen solid evidence to support the claims (and much to counter them). Overall, I view the ""documentary risk"" as low.Potential Competitive Threats Are A Legitimate Concern, But I Believe They Are Priced InAnother concern that weighs on Yelp's shares relates to on-going competitive threats, including those from much larger and better capitalized competitors like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). These are legitimate threats that obviously shouldn't be ignored. As with any internet company in a rapidly evolving market, there are considerable long-term competitive and technological risks.Keep in mind, however, that users in the internet world can tend to be somewhat sticky and Yelp has a early-mover advantage with considerable critical mass, momentum, and brand equity on their side. Because of their strong business position, growth rates have been and remain very strong for Yelp.Overall, I believe that Yelp is in a good long-term competitive position for the future and believe that the competitive risks are now more than priced into the share price. That said, of all the risks impacting Yelp's share price, I believe that competitive uncertainty is the most legitimate concern and justifies some caution.Relative Value Appears Attractive and Takeover Potential Has ImprovedValue investors, such as myself, are loathe to invest in any company that has a lot of growth already ""baked into"" the share price - as the headline valuation ratios look high in comparison to the industry averages. Worse yet, at this early and high-growth stage of development, the most useful valuation ratio is enterprise value (E.V.)/revenue rather than the preferred ratios of value investors (e.g. Price/Earnings or Price/Free Cash Flow). At the end of the day, however, it comes down to finding shares with positive expected value that are under-appreciated by the market and this can include the shares of companies that already have high growth expectations.Yelp currently trades at an (E.V.)/revenue ratio of 8.9x. This is very high in the context of the broader market, but you would expect a high multiple from a company that is experiencing 50%+ annual revenue growth. By comparison, Facebook, a company with somewhat weaker revenue growth trends, trades at 17.4x and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), a company with much slower growth trends, trades at 9.2x.To put this in context, Yelp's shares would have to increase 85% to achieve the revenue multiple of Facebook (again, a company with slower revenue growth trends). Also consider that Twitter's (NYSE:TWTR) $31 billion enterprise valuation is almost 10 times that of Yelp while only two years ago Twitter was behind where Yelp currently stands with respect to revenues (i.e. Twitter's 2012 revenues were lower than Yelp's 2014 revenues). Granted, Facebook has a much wider competitive moat and Twitter has higher growth rates (and both look richly valued), but these valuation discrepancies still seem too high to me.Image 3:What also attracts me to Yelp is the low absolute value of the company (now valued at $3.4bn) in the context of the company's strong business position and very high brand equity (one of those rare companies that has even become a verb, ""yelping something""). Yelp's low absolute valuation makes it an affordable takeover target for a number of different companies, which could include, in no particular order, Yahoo (YHOO), Google , and TripAdvisor, among others (all three of these companies have been rumored as potential buyers in the past).Yelp is a desirable company with a strong market position, huge brand equity, a broad consumer reach, international expansion potential, and very strong growth trends. Furthermore, for many of the large potential acquirers, an acquisition of Yelp (even at a substantial premium) would amount to a fraction of their enterprise values.I also believe that acquisition potential somewhat limits downside for Yelp relative to the upside. Further limiting downside is the fact that Yelp has a very strong balance sheet (net cash and marketable securities of over $422 million) and its operations aren't burning through cash (unlike many other high-growth companies) as the company is already free cash flow positive.Image 4:ConclusionFollowing the sell-off in Yelp's shares over the past year, I believe that relative value for the company now looks attractive and Yelp's low absolute valuation also makes it a very affordable and attractive acquisition target. Long-term visibility for a rapidly growing company like Yelp is limited. However, I believe that the magnitude and likelihoods of the upside scenarios now outweigh those of the downside (by a considerable margin). In other words, despite the risks and uncertainties, I believe that the expected value from investing in shares of Yelp is now very positive.That said, it should be made clear that Yelp is a speculative investment and competitive risks are real. I am optimistic about Yelp's future, but it is certainly possible that the company could disappoint and investors should size appropriately (Yelp accounts for less than 3% of my Fund's AUM at a cost basis of $47.62)."
3033926,22148,2015-03-28T12:14:52-04:00,"Yelp trades at multi-year lows due to user problems and an unflattering documentary.Mobile app provides a solution to the user problem, but it requires execution.Yelp remains an extremely attractive valuation with plenty of upside potential if it can execute on the mobile potential.","Though claims continue to persist that Yelp (NYSE:YELP) extorts business owners to extract advertising spending, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains the biggest issue. While the Kickstarter documentary is a headache and a concern that could plague Yelp for a while, the company actually has a solution to the Google problem, if it executes.The stock is trading near multi-year lows in the mid-$40s, but opportunity exists if the consumer review site can shake off the issues.Google ProblemThe major user problem with Yelp previously highlighted (see Yelp Faces A Major User Problem) is related to Google searches. Consumers that now search on the most popular search site on desktop are shown the following results. The major focus on the results are local restaurants based on Google reviews. Even worse, the Yelp result is fourth on the list after the Google reviews.Anybody doing the above search for a local Chinese restaurant, for example, is very unlikely to make it to the Yelp website and that is the major problem for now.Problem SolutionThe solution to the problem is pointing users directly to the Yelp mobile app. Instead of performing searches via Google, consumers would go directly to the app and bypass the large nemesis.Yelp plans to increase spending on marketing the app, but the install numbers per App Annie appear mixed. The app is maintaining a top 70 placements on the U.S. iOS list, but it doesn't reach any spectacular levels.Source: App AnnieIn fact, the Q4 mobile active users declined sequentially during the quarter to 72.3 million, down from 73.4 million in the prior quarterValuationThe case can be made to compare Yelp to other high-flying stocks like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), but another possibly more reasonable one is TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP). The latter provides consumer reviews for travel locations including hotels and even restaurants. To a certain extent, it competes against Yelp such as placing above Yelp in the above search result, but on a better front, it highlights the potential valuation metrics of a larger company in a related industry.TripAdvisor is worth around $12 billion so it is significantly larger than Yelp. One might think it has a lower PS multiple, but is actually significantly higher despite slower revenue growth. In reality, the recent declines of Yelp have the market awarding TripAdvisor with a significantly larger multiple.In previous articles, the argument was that Yelp could easily reclaim a multiple of nearly 10x forward revenue similar to Facebook or Twitter, the more conservative view is the stock gaining about 40% to reach the PS multiple of TripAdvisor.One aggressive view is the Wunderlich analyst that slapped a $90 price target on the stock. Yelp trades around $46 so the target is a very rare occasion for a nearly 100% gain on a well-known stock.TakeawayWhile we agree with Wunderlich that Yelp could reclaim previous highs and reach a level of nearly $90, the key is growing the user base while Google attempts to block traffic. The future is mobile traffic directly from the app, but the App Annie stats and Q4 results suggest new downloads are uninspiring.Yelp remains a value pick at these levels, but investors need to pay attention to the mobile traffic and not the documentaries."
3249755,23479,2015-06-10T12:38:09-04:00,"Yelp has emerged as a de-facto search engine for local businesses over the past few years.While the recent return on Nasdaq and S&P has been 7% and 3%, respectively, Yelp has fallen over -21%.At present we have a $50.45 price estimate on Yelp, which is 10% above with the current market price.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) has emerged as a de-facto search engine for local businesses over the past few years. However, over the past few months, the stock has underperformed the market as it has failed to live up to the analysts’ expectations. While the recent return on Nasdaq and S&P has been 7% and 3%, respectively, Yelp has fallen over -21%. Analysts were expecting a much higher growth rate than Yelp was able to deliver. However, we estimate that with the existing growth rate and revenue run rate, the stock is fairly valued at $50.45. In this note, we explore the base, bull and bear case for the company. A summary of this is as follows:The Base CaseIn the base case scenario, Trefis estimates that Yelp’s stock is worth $50.45. While its local advertising business contributes 80% to the price estimate, Yelp’s brand advertising and deals division makes up 11% of the estimated value, with cash accounting for the rest.The key drivers for the local ads division are average revenue per active advertising local business account and the number of advertising local business accounts listed with Yelp. The company has a total addressable market (NYSE:TAM) of 76 million local businesses in the world, of which 53 million are present in the Americas and Europe. This translates into a global market of nearly $130 billion. However, the number of active business, which pay for Yelp’s services, listed with the company is just a fraction of this market at 90,200 in Q1 2015. Trefis believes that the active advertising business will grow to 331,950 or 4.5% of 7.37 million claimed businesses by 2021. Furthermore, average revenue per active local business (ARPALB), which measures the monetization rate of a city or region, would grow to $4,667.Trefis estimates that Yelp’s mobile app will help the company attract more users to its web property (which includes both the web site and the app itself). This should bolster its brand advertising revenues as average revenue per unique visitor improves to $31.38 for over 263 million users by 2021.Yelp continues to expand its portfolio through acquisitions such as SeatMe and services through facilities such as Call to Action, which lets a user place an order from Yelp’s platform. We believe that, as more businesses are added to Yelp’s platform, these services will have an additive and network effect on deal division revenues, which will increase from $23.92 million to $107.52 million by 2021.The Bull Case: Stock Price Improves By 36%In the bull case scenario, we estimate that Yelp’s recent expansion into international markets, coupled with the continuous recruitment drive to persuade more businesses to join advertising services, can help the company to improve the share in claimed businesses from 4.5% to 5.5% by 2021. This would translate into 402,760 advertising businesses for local ads division. Trefis also estimates that the ARPALB for the bull case scenario can improve to $5495 by 2021 as cohort maturity plays an important part in improving monetization rate.Furthermore, initiatives such as Call to Action and the assimilation of acquired delivery services into its platform together can help the company to achieve an improvement in its deals division revenues to $176 million by 2021. However, brand advertising revenue will continue to grow at the base-case rate as competition from other online companies should restrict the ARPU growth rate. Trefis estimates that if the bull case scenario were to pan out, its stock price estimate for Yelp can increase by 36% to $68.The Bear Case: Stock Price Declines By 25% In the bear case scenario, on the other hand, we estimate that intense competition would prevent the conversion from claimed businesses to advertising business. As a result, the share in claimed businesses can decline from 4.5% to 4% by 2021. This would translate into 298,750 advertising businesses for local ads division. Furthermore, as the company is currently expanding into new geographies, the monetization rate can be negatively impacted. we estimate that the ARPALB for the bear case scenario can decline to $4,433 by 2021.Furthermore, the bear case foresees lower growth from initiatives such as call to action and the assimilation of acquired delivery services (SeatMe, Eat24) into the platform. Thus improvement in its deals division revenues grows at a slower rate to $100 million by 2021. However, the brand advertising revenue will continue to grow at the rate mentioned in base case scenario as competition from other online companies should restrict the ARPU growth rate while the growing popularity of app should offset the slower growth rate of ARPU. Given these factors, the bear case stock price estimate for Yelp will decline by 25% to $37.77.At present we have a $50.45 price estimate on Yelp, which is 10% above with the current market price.Disclosure: None"
3124976,22148,2015-04-30T17:28:53-04:00,Yelp reported highly disappointing Q1'15 earnings.The company has several catalysts to ramp up user growth and move away from a dependence on traffic from Google.The stock is suddenly worth only $3 billion and trades at very reasonable multiple of future revenue.,"With the stock collapsing to new lows, on the surface it definitely appears that Yelp (NYSE:YELP) needs some help. The consumer review site already has a well-defined Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) problem that is a major part of the user growth issue, especially internationally. Now the company outlined an internal sales issue and a disappointment with brand advertising adding to the troubles.The stock closed below $40 providing either an opportunity to buy Yelp at levels not seen in nearly two years or a major warning for investors to stay away. The company released disappointing Q1'15 earnings and Q2 guidance was below expectations.Yelp has two opportunities that appear to provide the help needed for the company to get over the current problems.Mobile AppThe biggest identified traffic issue with Yelp remains that Google changed its search algorithm to place internal reviews ahead of those from Yelp on related searches. The solution remains the mobile app so that consumers go directly to Yelp, thereby bypassing Google searches that lead them elsewhere. Yelp released that the App Unique Devices were only 16.0 million for Q1. The number was up nearly 50% over the 10.9 million from Q1 last year.Source: Yelp Q115 data sheetYelp has long reported the Mobile Unique Visitors showing the traffic shift to mobile. Until now though, it wasn't clear that the majority of the mobile traffic was from the mobile web. Basically, consumers doing a mobile search likely via Google. The good news in the quarter was that mobile users in total jumped to 78.9 million users, up from 72.3 million last quarter. The return to growth is an encouraging sign after the Q4 dip.The perplexing part of the story is why Yelp isn't advertising app installs to a greater extent. The company forecast increasing spending on advertising to $30 million, but it only spent around $2 million during Q1. The vast majority of the yearly spend isn't targeted until Q3 and Q4.A big key to future success is getting consumers to install the app and bypass Google, so huge growth in metric is very important going forward.Order DeliveryThe acquisition of Eat24 back in February didn't grab a ton of attention. Based on the Q1 results and growth from top competitor GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), this purchase is appearing very timely.Yelp paid roughly $134 million for Eat24 and according to the earnings call, the order delivery service generated roughly $9 million in revenue. Yelp only counted $5 million in the quarter with the close taking place roughly mid-quarter. In essence, Yelp ended the quarter with a revenue run-rate of roughly $112.5 million adding in the full quarter of revenue from Eat24.At the time of the deal, Yelp upped the full-year revenue guidance from $538 million to $543 million to $574 million to $579 million. The guidance was increased by $36 million at the mid-point, or what equates to roughly $10 million per quarter going forward. In reality, it appears that Eat24 will easily surpass those revenue totals now backed by Yelp. More likely, the company factored in some lower traditional revenue into the guidance mix.What makes Eat24 extremely interesting is that GrubHub is now worth $3.4 billion. My comparison, Yelp together with Eat24 is now worth only $3.2 billion based on the guidance for 80 million shares outstanding. During Q1, GrubHub produced revenues of $88.2 million, a 51% increase over the prior-year period. Maybe even more important, the leading takeout marketplace is very profitable with Q1 net income of $10.6 million.TakeawayYelp clearly lacks momentum and the market is punishing the stock for that issue. The stock is likely to trade lower in coming days and weeks as the market shuns the once popular social media sector stocks. The good news for Yelp investors is that help is on the way. The ability to shift focus to the mobile app and grow Eat24 provides a couple of major catalysts for the year.The market really didn't catch that Yelp maintained the original 2015 revenue guidance. Some skepticism regarding those numbers is warranted, but a 23% sell off is completely overdone. The stock needs to bottom out at likely lower prices before buying, but at this valuation the stock is extremely attractive. The stock now trades at less than 4x 2016 revenue estimates. Any further dips are just gravy for new positions."
2893706,22148,2015-02-07T12:39:49-05:00,Yelp reports Q414 earnings that beat analyst estimates.The consumer review site has seen user growth completely stall sending the stock down roughly 20% in early trading.The stock now has an attractive valuation based on growing monetization of local business accounts.,"Despite strong earnings numbers, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) faces an issue with struggling user growth. Most of the metrics used to track the growth of the company remain in major growth mode, but the consumer review site is struggling to expand much beyond the 130 million MUUs (monthly unique users) that it first reached during Q114.The consumer review site still offers the promise of connecting with the ad engine of local businesses. Mobile appears the key to getting past a recent hurdle with a competitor, but Yelp needs to make a lot of progress in that area for the stock to get rewarded with a larger valuation.Monthly User StrugglesYelp reported that Q414 MUUs were only 135 million. Sure this was 13% YoY growth, but it was a drop from 139 million in the prior quarter. It was only a slight increase from Q1 levels of 132 million suggesting an absolute stall in the growth of this metric. Even mobile users declined sequentially to 72.3 million from 73.4 million. The only user growth came in the international segment that saw a slight bump up to 30.8 million, though this number is still down from the highs of 31.1 million back in Q1.With all of the new international locations added over the last year, these totals should see substantial growth and not a full year of zero growth. Yelp is now in 29 countries meaning the average country only has roughly one million users.The CEO made several interesting statements on the earnings call that desktop usage had maxed out despite only 77.6 million MUUs and an even more perplexing comment about the end of traffic from Google (NASDGOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).In the last earnings call, a lot of the weakness in the international locations were blamed on Google making adjustments to search results that block traffic to Yelp. Either way, Yelp appears focused on driving all traffic to the mobile app and removing any reliance from obtaining traffic from Google that also operates as a competitor. For that reason, Yelp plans to increase the marketing budget to $30 million from only $10 million last year. If the marketing spend leads to app installs, the Google problem could solve itself.Other Metrics GrowingWhile the user metrics are struggling, the company continues to see solid engagement and active business accounts willing to spend more on advertising. Some of the key metrics were as follows:This continues to back the theory that Yelp has a long runway for growth with millions of small business customers to add to the platform. It also somewhat dispels the concept that local businesses will abandon the platform due to the reported strong arm tactics by sales reps.TakeawayAfter the selloff, Yelp only trades at roughly 6x 2015 revenue forecasts of around $540 million. The company still has a huge runway for adding active local business accounts domestically and it is just getting started internationally with revenue of only $3.3 million. The real issue is that Yelp needs to address the lack of user growth that it claims is already growing again in 2015. The connection to local businesses and engaged users keeps us interested in the stock, especially at the reduced valuation, but investors need to keep an eye on visitor growth to ensure Google isn't blocking growth more than the company wants to let on."
3028786,67775,2015-03-25T17:06:17-04:00,Acquisition of Eat24 helps its focus on a niche market.Smaller and more nimble firms are the biggest threat to Yelp.My DCF valuation shows there could easily be 20% upside to current prices.,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is one of the stocks which boggle one's mind. This firm has been able to beat analyst estimates in all the major earnings departments and still saw a huge downward swing in the stock post its earnings. Let's look at some of the figures to see why this might be the case and look if the market is justified in its current valuation or was it momentary volatility.YELP showed earnings of $0.08 per share against analyst expectations of $0.07 per share. Its revenue came in at $109.9 million, again beating the estimate of $108 million. So far so good. However the major issue with the firm was lower growth in the engagement on its platform. Cumulative reviews grew ""only"" 35% against 47% in the last year. Also the monthly unique visitors grew by 13% to 135 million against 37% in the previous year. For a firm which is aggressively priced this is seen as a huge let down and the markets reacted to this news with particular vengeance.Light at the end of the tunnelThese wild swings are not new for long-term investors in Yelp. Also as the firm matures it would not be able to deliver the same growth rates as it did when it had a lower base. The management has acknowledged that the next phase of its growth must come from mobile devices. According to estimates by Yelp about 65% of total searches are coming from mobile devices and over 50% of ad impressions are served on them. Going forward this figure will only increase, making mobile the dominant revenue stream. In the last quarter 350,000 transactions took place through mobile apps.Fig: Number of unique monthly visitors on Yelp through mobile devices. Although there was a small drop in sequential numbers in the latest quarter it still saw close to 37% growth over the same quarter last year.Acquisition of Eat24Yelp acquired Eat24, the online food ordering service, for a total of $134 million in stock and cash. Currently there are 20,000 restaurants in 1,500 cities which use Eat24 to offer online delivery and takeout services. Yelp plans to increase this number to 1 million by leveraging its own platform. This is an ideal purchase by Yelp which will help it focus on a niche market and help ward off bigger competitors like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The number of advertisers grew by 54% on the Yelp platform in the last quarter and this acquisition should provide it with a better tool to increase interactions with local businesses and build longer relationships.About CompetitionOne of the biggest qualms among the investing world has been the low entry point in this business. In every report for Yelp there is a mention of how Google and Facebook could overthrow its business model by adding a single click on their platform. Both firms are huge in every way and taking any competitive threats from them complacently would be a sure challenge for a small firm. Facebook accounted for over 20% of total time spent on the internet through mobile devices in United States. Google also has a huge advantage due to the ubiquitous use of Google Maps and the ability to modify its search parameters.However smaller firms are much more nimble and can direct their energies to a few niche products giving greater customer loyalty. Yelp has shown that it is up to the task by making good acquisitions like Eat24 and its European competitor Qype. In addition to this it has made useful partnerships with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) for Apple Maps and search results through Siri. There will always be a good number of smaller firms who would be pushing the envelope in terms of customer engagement, local relationships and newer applications. Yelp is one of these firms that can stand up to the might of Facebook and Google.The bigger danger for Yelp can be through other smaller firms. Many firms are aggressively expanding in different parts of the world to gain a foothold in this segment. Newer firms like Zomato, a restaurant discovery service which was launched in India, have increased their footprint to international markets. Zomato finished the latest funding round, valuing it at $660 million, and is present in 21 other countries. It purchased Urbanspoon for an undisclosed sum, estimated to be between $50 million to $60 million by several sources. Yelp will have to position itself to prevent encroachment from these newer and hungrier firms.Levered Returns ModelI use Levered Return's DCF model to find the implied fair value of the stock. Revenue is estimated to grow by 50% in 2015 which will slowly fall to 15% by 2019. EBITDA margins should rise significantly as the firm would require lower SG&A expense.Fig: Yelp's SG&A expenses as compared to its revenue. We can see that this percentage is falling very fast which will help increase the margins in the future.We estimate that EBITDA margins should expand to 30% by 2019. Capital expenses were 7.7% of revenues in 2014 due to higher expansion costs for the firm. However this should reduce as the firm reduces its investments and increases its revenue. We predict a gradual decrease to 3% by 2019.These numbers give an implied fair value per share of approximately $55 which is about 20% higher than the current market price.ConclusionYelp has a great business model which is in a niche market and provides benefit to both customers and the business community. It is well placed to take advantage of its high customer base and through partnerships and acquisitions it should be able to keep competition at a distance and build closer relationships with its users. As per our levered returns model the firm is trading at a good discount and should be a good investment for a long-term investor."
2996416,76785,2015-03-12T14:34:21-04:00,"Yelp has been abused by the market over the past year.Investors need to ask themselves if the company is still well positioned.Key questions are regarding sustainability, the company's moat, and diversification.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) has had a rough year. After riding high for some time, investors have turned their backs on the stock, leading to a collapse in market cap even as the company continues to take steps towards profitability. Were expectations out of line, and are they still? Investors should ask themselves three important questions. If they can't answer them favorably, they should exit the stock.Is The Business Model Sustainable?Like many know, the vast majority of Yelp's revenue comes from the Local Advertising segment. By tempting local businesses with free online business accounts to track trends and reply to reviews, the company hopes to attract these same businesses to paid features such as enhanced profiles, pay for advertisement, and other various features.By definition, the company seeks to help businesses that need help promoting their business. In general, this is going to lead to turnover. Highly successful businesses won't need their products and those who do may not need their core products after a certain period of time as they build a loyal customer base. This means that the company has to constantly attract more businesses through sales efforts.This constant turnover in business is part of the reason why SG&A Expenses have accelerated strongly along with the stellar revenue growth over the past few years. There has been definite improvement on the income statement over the years, but can the company maintain the growth long term to justify its valuation? Yelp is spending plenty of company funds marketing and focusing on community outreach to support both the local businesses the company hopes to attract to its paid model, but will these initiatives be enough to keep and retain business? Without retention, the company will have a hard time generating leverage and truly being profitable.Is There an Established Moat?Yelp has established itself as a market leader in the products its offers, but its share is declining as the business environment changes and companies like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) enter into direct competition for its most important asset: an engaged user base posting relevant, quality reviews. Facebook's advantage here is high as most of Yelp's users are more than likely highly engaged Facebook users as well. Being able to use one platform makes a lot of sense both to the user if Facebook wants to enter this market full force through Place Tips.A buyout seems unlikely. A takeover at the current market capitalization of $3.45B means that the acquirer is going to book approximately $3B in goodwill during the acquisition as Yelp only has approximately $500M in net assets (backing out its own goodwill and liabilities). I don't see that happening. Big technology companies that would be able to pay for Yelp are wary of impairment charges after years of hefty hits in the technology industry (Hewlett-Packard's $8.8B charge related to Autonomy, Microsoft's aQuantive $6.2B writedown to name a few large instances).Big companies like Facebook and Google are more apt to believe they can build a similar business from scratch for less. And they probably can. Leveraging their own existing business models, big technology like these two have incredible advantages (name recognition, already established market relationships, greater financial resources) compared to Yelp and its stand-salone business model.Can the company diversify its offerings?Very few successful companies do one thing and one thing only long term and keep high profitability intact. If Yelp cannot monetize in other ways beyond its core business focus on local restaurant and shopping locations, it may be in trouble. In its most recent three year history, the company has done little to fix these problems:Revenue concentration in the Local Advertising segment has actually grown as Brand Advertising growth has stagnated. The company's recent acquisition of Eat24 may boost the Other category in 2015, but it still puts the focus even more so on restaurants. Other company ventures (Yelp Deals, the gift certificates platform) are hardly innovative and don't shine as strong standalone products that will drive growth. If consumers ever make a fundamental shift in their habits regarding visiting restaurants/shopping and the reviews they leave, Yelp may be left out in the cold.ConclusionFor investors, these three questions are key. Another investor may ponder on these three thoughts and come up with completely different answers, and that is what makes markets work. But to me, the company doesn't have a stable and consistent future, which is what I look for in short opportunities. Even after the recent tempering of expectations, estimates for the company in regards to revenue and profitability growth remain high over the next few years, so long investors should proceed with caution."
2829716,70965,2015-01-19T06:27:31-05:00,"Buyout rumors drove Yelp's trading a couple weeks ago.The rumors were absurd because we think at its current valuation, a buyout offer would be in the $60 region.However, we see a buyout of Yelp at these valuations as extremely unlikely.","By Parke ShallWe've kept an eye on Yelp (NYSE:YELP) over the last couple of months. The once sky high flying restaurant review website was looking like it was going to breach $100. After touching highs barely above $95, the company failed to impress in a couple of earnings calls and has been brought down to Earth by investors. Today, the company trades at around $51 per share.YELP data by YChartsIt's been more than rumours at this point. The buyout case has been a legitimate case for Yelp shareholders and it's been talked about when discussing the long case for the company frequently. Similar to companies like Whole Foods (WFM) and Pandora (NYSE:P), the buyout case is more than speculation, it's part of the thesis.Yelp saw a brief surge in volume and in price two weeks ago, as rumours of interest in a buyout from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) surfaced for the second time in the last couple of months. It's long been rumored that Google or even Yahoo (YHOO) could be staking a bid for Yelp.Specifically, rumours a couple weeks ago on Twitter were that Google wanted to offer $70+/share, but that Yelp's Board of Directors was holding out for an offer in the $80 range. After the stock spiked in Tuesday's trading, it pared its gains to finish the day at $52.47. While the buyout rumours could hold merit, it's still an extraordinarily high valuation for Yelp, and we're not sure that a buyout could occur at those prices.Unfortunately, those waiting for a Yelp buyout may be waiting longer than they anticipated. Today's valuation on the company doesn't lead us to believe that a buyout is a likely scenario for what the company brings to the table.At today's price, we think a buyout in the $70s or the $80s isn't likely. As a matter of fact, we're not really sure that a buyout would be on the table at all, unless Yelp's price drifts downward. Being an equity holder in a speculatively priced company with a growing number of shares outstanding just doesn't interest us.YELP Shares Outstanding data by YChartsAt today's valuation, the company is trading at a scorching 10x revenue, in the midst of a market that doesn't seem too sure of itself. Yelp trades at 7x its book value, and has a conventional forward P/E ratio of 129. While the balance sheet looks decent, and the company isn't carrying any long term debt, its growth story is all it has to hang onto. The indices have seen volatile trading to start 2015, and Yelp supporting its valuation may get tougher and tougher.Buying Yelp in hopes that a buyout could ""sweeten"" or supplement the bull case, we believe is foolish. Should Yelp stock shed some of its value and move downward, we'll reconsider a position in the company. For now, however, we suggest not betting on a Yelp buyout."

Users read and write reviews about all kinds of businesses - everything from restaurants to boutiques to mechanics, plumbers, massage parlors and more. These reviews benefit businesses that receive positive reviews, and customers searching for quality services. Yelp has a relatively large geographic footprint:Source: Company FilingsIt's important to note that a business can be reviewed on the Yelp site, but that doesn't necessarily mean that business is one of Yelp's paying customers. In the vast majority of cases, in fact, user-reviewed businesses are not paying advertisers for the company. Of the 1.5 million ""claimed"" local businesses, a mere 67,000 (~4.5%) were active advertisers, who pay for Yelp's service in Q4 2013.Source: Company FilingsYelp has a wide geographic reach and an interesting business model, but we are turned off by its rich valuation. We can't say precisely what the catalyst might be for Yelp's possible decline, but we are very concerned about the combination of high price plus operational challenges within the company. In sum, we find that Yelp's high valuation prices the stock for a perfection it does not deserve, for reasons we outline below.Stubbornly Elusive Profits In Spite Of Rising RevenueWhile finally turning a profit in 2014, Yelp is growing revenue, but net income remains stubbornly elusive.Source: Company FilingsYelp has yet to convert its revenue into profit for its shareholders.Perhaps one of the reasons net income is elusive in spite of high revenue growth is the fact that Selling and Marketing Expenses are rising approximately as fast as Revenues are. This calls the efficiency of the sales activities at Yelp into question. We'd like to see an increase in revenue and a simultaneous flattening out of Sales related expenses.Perhaps the most troubling aspect of revenue growth is the fact that it might very well slow down. According to Yelp's most recent 10-K:This begs the question: if Yelp's revenue growth will be muted in the future and sales expenses as a percentage of sales are high, where will profitability come from? This admitted revenue slow down is very disconcerting to a new shareholder who is being asked to pay more than 2600 times earnings for the stockReturn Measures And Sources Of CashIn addition to problems with the relationship between (eventually slowing) revenue and profit, a look at Yelp's Cash Flow Statement and return numbers should give investors pause.Yelp's cash flow from financing has consistently dwarfed its cash flow from operations. CFF is about 6.25x greater than CFO (303.65 vs. 48.36 million respectively). If this trend persists, we believe the weighted average cost of capital for Yelp will inevitably rise (assuming the company can still access debt or equity capital at the same rate).Yelp's ROA (0.35%) and ROE (0.37%) are practically nonexistent. Return on assets (ROA) shows us how much of a return management can make on the assets that it has at its disposal. It seems that the providers of Yelp's capital are earning less than they could if they had put their capital in a high-interest bank account (a roughly ~1.3% return). We fear that at some point, this fact will become apparent to providers of capital and that causes us to fear for Yelp's continued ability to access capital at favorable rates.We consider the high CFF + the low ROA and ROE numbers + the relatively high rate of growth of capital expenditure at the company + the seeming inability to turn revenue into profits to be a toxic mixture. Taken alone they are each a reason to avoid the stock. Combined they represent a very high level of risk to shareholders.Peer ComparisonWe want to highlight Yelp's incredibly high P/E ratio of 2,676.27. To put this valuation into some kind of historical context, we should remind investors that at the height of the dot-com mania, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), one of the most expensive S&P 500 stocks at the time, had a P/E ratio of 196.2, followed by Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) with a P/E of 148.4. It could be argued that they were terrible investments during the dot-com, though they were at the time much more profitable and valued more cheaply than Yelp is now.Compared to its peers in the Online Media Industry in North America, Yelp is the most expensive on a P/E basis - undeservedly so, in our view. For instance, Yelp's P/E (2,676.27) is 53 times more expensive than TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) (P/E of 49.84), 411 times more expensive than Yahoo! (YHOO) (P/E 6.5), 99 times more expensive than Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (P/E of 26.94) and 10 times more expensive than the next most expensive online media stock, HomeAway (NYSEARCA:AWAY) (P/E of 240.82).All P/Es From YCharts As Of December 15, 2014When we put Yelp's numbers into context with some of its peers, we see that Yelp is inferior (or second from the bottom) compared to the industry.Source: GurufocusOne metric that Yelp excels at is 1-year revenue growth. As was previously mentioned, Yelp itself has called for a (likely) slow down in revenue going forward. On every other metric, Yelp comes in last or second to last.Possible Competition From WHO?Source: Company FilingsPerhaps most disconcerting of all is the fact that Yelp's biggest competition comes from a company called ""Google"" (e.g., Google Search, Google Plus, Google Now, Google Maps, etc.), which itself hosts reviews. At the moment, more than 50% of traffic that Yelp enjoys comes by way of Google's search engine. This means that at any time, Yelp faces the risk that Google will engage in ""search bias"" by changing search algorithms to direct more traffic to Google and less to Yelp. This is problematic from Yelp's perspective because, according to Alexa.com, in October 2014, Google was ranked as the most popular website globally and in the United States; Yelp, by comparison, is #133 globally and #36 in the United States.Naturally, Yelp and other companies complained to the FTC that this practice is anti-competitive. Yelp and those other companies lost. The FTC ruled in Google's favor:On the other hand, Yelp may continue to grow. According to Forbes, Yelp's current customer base represents less than 0.3% of all U.S. local businesses. This presents Yelp with tremendous growth potential. The problem is that the way this potential is unfolding is not benefiting shareholders, so we recommend taking a pass on these expensive shares.ConclusionInvestors are paying a very high premium for Yelp's growth in future profits compared to other companies in the Internet Content industry. So far, that growth in profits has eluded Yelp, and we don't see signs of the situation changing for the better. Since we can't be sure that Yelp will enjoy any growth in the future, our advice is not to overpay for it. We recommend YELP investors sell and buy one of its cheaper, more profitable peers."
2678365,20521,2014-11-13T11:33:57-05:00,,"According to a recent eMarketer report on the US mobile advertising market, the sector is projected to grow 82% in 2014 to $9 billion. eMarketer expects US mobile advertising to grow to $28.4 billion by the year 2018 and account for 85.9% of the US digital advertising market compared with the 39.5% share this year. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remains the leader in the market with 68.5% market share in 2013. However, other players are eating into its share. Google’s share is projected to drop to 65.7% in 2014 and to 64.2% in 2016. The researcher predicts that local reviews site Yelp will perform impressively in the coming quarters with their market share growing from 1% in 2013 to 1.9% by 2016.Yelp’s Financials Yelp (NYSE:YELP) saw revenues grow 68% over the year for the September quarter to $102.5 million, ahead of the market’s expectations of $99 million. Yelp’s primary source of revenues, the local business ad segment, saw sales improve 66% over the year to $85.1 million. A quarter ago, that number had improved 69%. Yelp reported the quarter’s EPS at $0.05, also ahead of the Street’s target of $0.03.Among operating metrics, Yelp saw cumulative reviews increase 41% over the year to 67 million. Monthly users improved 19% to 139 million and average monthly mobile unique visitors grew 46% to approximately 73 million. Active local business accounts increased 51% over the year to 86,200 which was short of the market’s expectations of 87,000 accounts.For the current quarter, Yelp projected revenues of $107 million-$108 million compared with the Street’s forecast of $111 million.Yelp’s International Growth Yelp has been focused on delivering growth through international expansion. During the recently ended quarter, Yelp added their presence in Chile and Hong Kong, making their services available in 29 countries in 16 languages. Keeping with the need for local language presence, Yelp also introduced mobile review translation that lets global consumers translate reviews into any of their supported languages.More recently, Yelp grew their European operations through two acquisitions. Earlier this month, they announced the acquisition of German restaurant review site Kritik. They followed it with the purchase of France’s biggest review site CityVox. Terms of the deals were not disclosed. Yelp plans to leverage the acquisitions not only to add a user base, but also to improve local-focused content in local language. CityVox, for instance, has an impressive photo content which would be beneficial for Yelp.Since Yelp is looking at acquisitions to grow their presence, I think Zomato would be a good add to their portfolio as well. Zomato is a restaurant discovery site founded in India in 2008. Today the company has expanded their presence internationally to presence in fifteen countries including the latest additions in New Zealand, The Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Zomato plans to expand to ten more countries this year including Poland, Ireland, Malaysia, Vietnam, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, and Canada. They have information on over 250,000 restaurants with access to more than 23 million users and are expected to end the current year with revenues of INR100 crore (~$16.3 million).Yelp’s Improved Offerings Additionally, Yelp is also improving their offerings. It has recently added Yelp Platform transactions and reservations to the business dashboard. The new feature will let businesses see how many consumers are interacting with these businesses through Yelp. Yelp already supports over 28,000 businesses on the Platform that lets these local restaurants and hotels conduct business transactions directly through their site. More than 250,000 transactions were conducted on the Platform during the last quarter.Their stock is trading at $60.58 with a market capitalization of $4.39 billion. It touched a 52-week high of $101.75 in March this year.Disclosure: None"

While the company continues to report good growth in its core local ads business, the pace of this growth is directly related to the duration of its presence in the regions where Yelp operates. In the last few years, Yelp has expanded to regions outside the U.S. where the purchasing power of businesses and users is low compared to the U.S. Therefore, we believe that the pace of local ads growth will slow down as cohorts within the U.S. mature and revenues from newer regions kick in. As a result, in this earnings announcement, growth in the local ads business will be the key focal point and will give us a fair indication of the expected revenue growth in the coming quarters. We will continue to monitor the monetization rate of its existing and new cohorts. Additionally, revenue growth from mobile devices and the Deal, Partnership and Other services (DPO) business will be critical for the future as these services form a significant portion of Yelp's revenues in the coming quarters.Outlook for Q4 and 2014For Q4 FY14, the company guided revenues to be in $107 - $108 million range, representing growth of approximately 52% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted EBITDA was to be in the range of $24 million to $25 million. For the full year, Yelp has guided to an increase in net revenue to a range of $375-$376 million, while adjusted EBITDA should be in $69.5-$70.5 million range.Growth In Local Ads Business To ContinueThe local ads business currently accounts for around 80% of Yelp's stock value, in our view, and is its biggest revenue source. During Q3 FY14, active local business accounts grew by 51% year-over-year to approximately 86,200, slower than expected, The primary drivers for Yelp's account growth are its international expansion efforts and the cumulative increase in reviews on the Yelp site for its existing markets. The company has a total addressable market (TAM) of 73 million local businesses in the world, of which 53 million are present in North America, Europe and New Zealand. As the company continues to expand in international markets, we expect the active local business accounts to grow in the coming quarters. Furthermore, we expect average revenue per active business account, which is a function of the duration of Yelp's services in a region, to grow from $2,890 in 2013 to $3,380 by 2021 as the monetization rate in older cohorts increases. With this earnings announcement, we will continue to monitor these performance metrics to ascertain whether the company will be able to maintain its growth trajectory going forward.Revenue Share From International Operations To IncreaseRecently, the company has added cities in Asia (Hong Kong) and countries in Latin America (Chile) to its addressed markets. As a result of this and other expansions, international traffic, which grew over 30% year-over-year to approximately 30 million unique visitors on a monthly average basis in Q3, has become an important indicator for Yelp's expected revenue growth. Revenue from international markets now contributes nearly 30% to Yelp's top line and at some point will exceed revenues from the U.S. While it is still early for Yelp to report any significant traction in revenues from international markets, we continue to closely monitor the revenue from these markets as it will help us in ascertaining the monetization rate in newer regions. However, we believe that as the company expands to new territories, its selling, general and administration (SG&A) and marketing costs will increase and lower the company's profitability and cash flow as a percent of sales.Growth In Mobile Ads Metrics In FocusAlthough Yelp has been successful in expanding its local ads business by inorganic and organic means, it still needs to monetize its properties more effectively to increase its overall revenue. While Yelp has been using display ads to monetize its websites, it launched display ads for its mobile platform in 2013. Yelp reported that 50% of unique visitors (~73 million monthly users) used mobile devices for accessing Yelp's services in Q3 FY14, and 45% of new reviews came from mobile devices. Considering the rampant growth in the usage of mobile devices, we expect the mobile platform to become a major revenue driver for Yelp's brand ads division. In this earnings announcement, we aim to quantify the revenue generated through mobile display ads. We expect that Yelp will continue to report growth in monthly mobile users in Q4 and are closely following this number in the upcoming earnings announcement.Growth In Revenues From Deals PlatformYelp's deal, partnership and other services (DPO) division contributes 6.6% to its value, according to our model. Currently, Yelp generates revenue from this division through any transaction that might occur on its website. Yelp's deals platform allows merchants to promote themselves and offer discounted goods and services on a real-time basis to consumers directly on Yelp's website and mobile app. Yelp charges a fee on Yelp Deals for acting as an agent in these transactions. In a move to diversify its revenue stream, Yelp expanded its services in 2013 by introducing new features. These include the Call to Action program, which lets a business promote its services by offering discounts as well as a new delivery platform to serve its clients. If these delivery services gain traction among Yelp users, Yelp's DPO division can be an important growth driver going forward. In this earnings announcement, the focus will be on revenue growth from these services. Currently, Yelp's DPO division contributes only 6% to total revenues. However, we expect its contribution to increase to 8% by 2021.Our price estimate for Yelp stands at $61.74, which is 17% below its current market price. We invite the reader to adjust the model and create his or her own alternative valuation.Disclosure: No positions."
2834136,80716,2015-01-20T16:26:27-05:00,Paid customer churn is excessive because a lot of the theoretical benefits YELP offers small business owners can be realized for free.Cost of customer acquisition has spiked while Active Local Business Account (ALBA) growth has slowed dramatically.International is not happening because of excessive reliance on GOOG for consumer traffic and low brand awareness.Consumer reviews are ubiquitous all over the internet. Yelp's first mover advantage in the category gets eroded every day.,"Investors should be leery of business models where even customer success results in churn. Online dating businesses have this problem. If the guy paying eHarmony $20 per month actually meets the love of his life on the site, he's going to stop paying them $20 per month. Mission accomplished, thanks eHarmony. Great for the customer, but now eHarmony needs to replace that lost revenue stream. Yelp's (NYSE:YELP) model faces a similar paradox in the instances where the service actually delivers the promised uptick in revenues. This uptick most likely emanates from star rating volume and quality scores suddenly (and nefariously?) improving soon after the small business owner decides to pony up the ~$300 per month.Consider a hypothetical example: Say I want to open a new restaurant. After much blood, sweat, and tears my new restaurant opens for business but traffic is a little slow despite great feedback from customers and a positive review in the local paper. One day, a Yelp salesman calls and says: ""I see that you have been open for 6 months, but only have 5 reviews on Yelp with an average rating of 3 stars...."" He then proceeds to tell me some stats about the average revenue lift that Yelp advertisers get and how the higher ranking in search listings on the site will lead to more reviews and probably a higher quality score too; after all, by all accounts my restaurant is a good one, I just need help getting the word out. He mentions the obvious benefits of increasing the volume and quality score of my reviews. Business has been slow, so I decide to give it a shot and commit to a 1 year subscription package which costs me ~$300 / month. Not cheap, but I want to give it a try.Eleven months later my Yelp salesmen calls me back and says ""hey, I see you now have 50 reviews and an average rating of 4 stars! You want to renew right?"" Sure enough, my star count and quality went up dramatically after advertising, as promised! My restaurant is now doing great! But to his surprise, I tell him thanks but no thanks since the $300 was always steep and now that I have so many reviews, I don't think I really need to renew. I tell him this because I know that my business should continue to do very well on its own and I actually can get all the benefits of Yelp for free since my review metrics now have sufficient substance as to be of utility to consumers. In fact, I actually think at this point I will get more clicks and traffic to my page if my listing is no longer denoted as paid (I always wondered who actually clicked on the denoted paid listings).So, despite my apparent success as a paying Yelp customer, I really don't have an incentive to renew since much of the benefits are readily available for free once reviews are moderately scaled and positive. Of course, the opposite is also true - if my business stinks and despite my $300 per month, my reviews continue to languish in the 1-3 star range so I am very likely to churn in this case too. Really, the only time it's rationale for me to advertise on Yelp is if my business is just getting off the ground and I want to expedite review growth/quality or if my biz is struggling and I want to try all options including a Hail Mary via Yelp - of course Hail Marys rarely get completed. In each of these somewhat rationale scenarios I still will churn after my 1 year sub lapses.This is why Yelp customer churn is likely very, very high. In fact, by taking their reported customer repeat rate and reported ALBA number we can back into a Q3 quarterly churn rate of 18.4%. Annualized this is ~74% churn. The same calculation for each of Yelp's reported quarters reveals that excessive churn has always been an issue and that it tends to oscillate between 16.3 and 19.1% quarterly.Because Yelp is likely losing customers almost as fast as it's gaining them, they have started to miss street expectations on their most important metric: Active Local Business Accounts (ALBAs, just a fancy term for paying customer). This has happened each of the past 2 reported quarters and is a big reason why the stock has retreated well off highs. The problem for Yelp investors is that this dynamic is not yet fully appreciated by the sell side consensus and therefore street estimates for 43% and 37% y/y revenue growth in 15' and 16' respectively are a pipe dream. Unless Yelp can pull another Yellow Page like deal out its hat like it did in Q3, gross ALBAs need to accelerate in 2015 to hit street numbers - a tall task considering that the current trend is a massive deceleration.Churn is not the only problem here but it sort of explains a lot. For instance, because they are losing customers at such a high rate, they started to ramp up sales and marketing (S&M) opex in Q2 and Q3 meaningfully. In fact, Yelp spent ~$8k for each net ALBA addition in Q3. (Divide reported Q3 S&M by net ALBA additions). This is up 48% y/y and 8% sequentially. Keep in mind, that if we are right about the churn being so high, then this is a strategy where Yelp is paying $8k to acquire each new customer who then pays Yelp ~$3.6k per year, but remember, ~74% will drop out after 12 months! Not exactly the most sustainable use of working capital. Further, the increasing S&M per net acquired customer is yielding decelerating net ALBA growth. Yelp is paying more and more for less and less. Or, they are having to run faster and faster on the treadmill just to stay in place.Finally, a few other items of concern:· At the start of 2014 Yelp bulls (myself included as I used to be bullish) were optimistic about Yelp's expansion into Europe after several quarters of digesting Qype (Yelp like European asset they bought in Q3 12). The reason for optimism was that Yelp began migrating their Qype accounts over to the Yelp platform in late 2013 which we thought would set the stage for traction in the region beginning in 14'. Unfortunately, it's just not happening. For instance, despite a minuscule international revenue base from which to grow, international remains stuck in the mud at just 3% of total revenues where it has stagnated for 3 straight quarters. I think this is because Yelp's model requires an inherent network effect in order to attract advertisers, but they lack brand recognition in Europe and building out user generated content has been slow going as a result. Further, Yelp has disclosed that over 50% of its user traffic is sourced from GOOG and that GOOG's search algo alternations in 2014 have negatively impacted international visitor growth. The fact that Yelp relies on a competing ad seller for over 50% of its traffic is a huge problem in and of itself. But as it relates to their prospects for ramping up a meaningful international business, it's going to be an even more serious headwind.· Bulls often cite anecdotal evidence that they and ""everyone they know"" pulls up the Yelp app or mobile site as a pre-requisite to planning an evening out. I must say, I sometimes do the same. To be fair, in places like NYC where there's basically infinite choice and discoverable local biz destinations, Yelp has a lot of consumer utility. But, despite the bullish anecdotal evidence of widespread use, Yelp stopped disclosing mobile app usage in Q2 14' after having provided the metric since 2012. For those who don't know, companies typically stop disclosing things when the metric starts to look bad. Couple this with the reliance on GOOG and the empirical evidence around user adoption/growth begins to look a little less positive.· User reviews used to be dominated by Yelp, but that's just not the case anymore. In fact, I recently did a local restaurant search comparison between Yelp and Facebook for places to go in NYC and I found Facebook typically had more quantity and quality. Try it yourself. Of course GOOG, TRIP, PCLN/OPEN, GRUB etc all have their fair share of local reviews too. The point here is that I'm not so sure Yelp's review stockpile is as differentiated as it used to be and the gap narrows every day. Bulls say Yelp will get acquired, but with reviews getting increasingly commoditized, I don't think a bigger player will have much urgency to make a move at the present EV.In conclusion, because of high churn and several other yellow flags noted above, Yelp gets 1 star by this reviewer."

The company once again reported growth as revenues increased by 67% year over year to $102 million. However, Yelp reported a substantial improvement in net income, which grew to $3.63 million. Yelp's Adjusted EBITDA also improved significantly to $20.1 million in Q3 FY14 compared to adjusted EBITDA of $8.1 million in prior-year quarter. In sum, the company continued to report good growth across all its performance metrics.The company reported 41% growth in cumulative reviews to 67 million and a 19% increase in average unique monthly visitors to 139 million. Additionally, the company reported high engagement on mobile devices as unique visitors from mobile increased to 73 million from 50 million. While active local business accounts increased by 55% year over year to 86,000, claimed local businesses increased to 1.9 million. Overall, we are encouraged by Yelp's results and think that the business seems to be on the growth path. Below, we review Yelp's Q3 FY 14 results by segment.Outlook for Q3 and 2014For Q4 FY14, the company expects revenues to be in $107 - $108 million range, representing growth of approximately 52% compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $24 million to $25 million. For the full year, Yelp has announced an improvement in guidance and projects net revenue to be in the $375-$376 million range, while adjusted EBITDA should be in $69.5-$70.5 million range.International Expansion Boosts Revenues and CostsThe local ads division makes up 80% of Yelp's estimated value. One of the primary drivers for local ads division is the number of active business accounts on Yelp. During Q3 FY14, active local business accounts grew by 51% year-over-year to approximately 86,200. The primary reasons for growth in this driver are the international expansion under way and the increase in cumulative reviews on the Yelp site, which increases its appeal to advertisers and users alike. Recently, the company added Chile and Hong Kong to its addressed markets. As a result, international traffic grew over 40% year-over-year to approximately 30 million unique visitors on a monthly average basis. Furthermore, the company said that revenue from international markets is expected to gain traction in the coming quarters as it monetizes regions such as cohorts in Italy which were set up three years ago. We expect this expansion spree to bolster the number of active business accounts on Yelp to over 412,000 by 2021. However, we believe that as the company expands to new territories, its selling, general and administration (SG&A) and marketing costs will increase and lower company's profitability and cash-flow as a percent of sales.Mobile To Bolster RevenuesThe unique visitor is one of the primary drivers for Yelp as it affects both its local ads business and Brand ads division, and during the quarter monthly unique visitors grew to 139 million. However, 50% of these unique visitors (~73 million monthly users) used mobile devices for accessing Yelp's services. During the quarter, 45% of new reviews, which were close to 5 million, came from mobile devices. Considering the rampant growth in the usage of mobile devices, we expect the mobile platform to become a major revenue driver for Yelp in the future. The growing number of consumers searching for local businesses online constitutes Yelp's existing market, and in addition to the company's global expansion plans, we believe adoption of Yelp's mobile platform will drive this growth in unique visitors on the Yelp site.We are currently in the process of updating our Yelp model. At present we have a $60.44 price estimate on Yelp, which is inline with the market price.Disclosure: No positions."

To access private start-ups, an investor usually must invest through a venture capital firm that charges fees of 2% and 20%. Yelp (NYSE:YELP), at current valuations, presents an interesting opportunity for ordinary investors to add early-stage company exposure to their diversified portfolio through a publicly listed company, without paying venture capital fees. Just as low-risk investments such as bonds, utilities and real estate have a place in a diversified portfolio, so do high-growth, high-risk, swing-for-the-fences type of stocks (albeit a small percentage of your overall portfolio, say 5%-10%).Why does Yelp potentially qualify as a good venture capital-type investment? Let's consider factors VCs often look at:End-Consumers Like The Product/Service, Platform Has StickinessWhen a company's name is used as a verb in everyday vocabulary (i.e.: let's ""yelp"" that restaurant), it's a good sign it's a successful product/service that resonates with end-consumers. It suggests there is stickiness and real value proposition in the platform. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has become the action verb for online search. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) carry similar name recognition for social media. And Yelp has it for local business reviews.With 139 million average monthly unique users worldwide as of September 2014, and Google and Yahoo (YHOO) offering to buy the company prior to its IPO, it seems Yelp has established itself with consumers as a reliable source for local business reviews.Large, Lucrative MarketEven with its current platform and reach, Yelp has only begun to scratch the surface of monetization. Yelp's 2014 sales are expected to be $376 million, which represents just 1% of the $37 billion U.S. local online ad market, as disclosed in the company's Q3 2014 Investor Deck. In addition, with over 44% of total sales coming from its first cohort of 6 cities (out of 115 cities), there's ample room for future sales growth as the other 109 cities are fully monetized over time. Even though Yelp is publicly traded, it still offers the potential growth trajectory of a private, early-stage start-up.Strong Management TeamJeremy Stoppelman is Yelp's co-founder and CEO. Before he co-founded Yelp, Jeremy was VP of Engineering at PayPal. At PayPal, Jeremy met Max Levchin, co-founder of PayPal, who invested in Yelp in the early stages. After PayPal was acquired by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), Jeremy left to attend Harvard Business School. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Motors (NASDAQ:TSLA) and SpaceX, was asked to write a business school recommendation for Harvard. ""I don't think Jeremy needs to go to Harvard,"" is what Musk wrote. Sure enough, Jeremy dropped out of Harvard after one year to start Yelp.Strong management team, check.Profitability and Network EffectMost early-stage start-ups burn cash and require additional rounds of financing to get them to profitability. Yelp is cash flow-positive, becoming EBITDA-positive in Q2 2012. Most of Yelp's current cost comes from entering new markets and acquiring new customers, with sales and marketing comprising 55% of sales in Q3 2014.Yelp's established markets perform quite well. As shown in the investor Q3 2014 Investor Deck on page 24, established markets from the 2005-2006 period cohort generate average ad revenues that are 15 times more than the developing markets from the 2009-2010 cohort.For these established markets, users come to Yelp to provide their opinions and comments for free. Users come willingly to Yelp because of their leading position and its network effect. Yelp is then able to monetize against all of this valuable, free consumer information. This model is similar to user-generated content on Google's YouTube. Google does not have to directly pay for a considerable portion of the content that makes it to YouTube (users post willingly to the dominant platform), but YouTube can generate ad revenue from that content. This only works once you've established a leading platform with network effects.ValuationYelp currently trades at a $4.2 billion market cap. The 2015 sales multiple is 7.8x and the 2015 Non-GAAP P/E is 55x.With those type of multiples, you are definitely investing in a high-risk/high-reward type stock. However, the two metrics worth focusing on are the relative small size of the market cap (under $5 billion) and the price per user (around $30 per user, or 30x).Size Compared to Other Private Company ValuationsYelp may be publicly traded, but its potential growth trajectory is comparable to private venture-backed companies. In terms of valuation, Yelp's $4.5 billion valuation is about in the middle of the valuation ranges that private companies are getting.In terms of price per user, the 30x per user comes in below the average of 51.7x for consumer technology companies.ConclusionYelp is not for everyone. It's a high-risk, high-reward stock that offers an interesting way to play the early-stage investing space through a publicly-traded equity, without having to pay venture capital fees. It checks a lot of boxes a VC firm would look for in an emerging company, and its valuation appears cheap relative to comparable consumer tech companies."
2587915,22148,2014-10-23T09:07:40-04:00,"Yelp reported Q314 earnings.Stock is a solid buy on any dips.The original investment thesis didn't anticipate the mixed guidance, but the stock remains on strong growth trajectory factoring in normal bumps in the road.","After the close, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) reported Q314 earnings that easily beat company guidance and analyst estimates. The online consumer review site provided mixed Q4 guidance that disappointed the market, sending stock down as much as 15% in after hours.For Q3, Yelp generated 67% revenue growth over the prior year period and the $102.5 million number easily beat analyst estimates of $99.0 million. The company produced EPS of $0.05 that again easily beat estimates of $0.03. The problems were encountered when the company only forecast $107 million to $108 million of revenue for Q4. In addition, some concerns surround the user base only expanding 1 million monthly unique users sequentially to reach 139 million. Management suggested on the earnings call that some changes in the Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) algorithms will have a short-term impact on absolute users to the site, but that users eventually find the site via other methods. The addition of 7,300 active local business accounts is a good sign of the value of the platform.The original investment thesis in the article ""Yelp: Looking Into 2015"" is further enhanced by the lower stock price and strong growth metrics. It is not surprising for the consumer review service to have bumps in the road, but the long-term view is not tarnished by the guidance. Investors need to keep in mind that the company originally guided to Q3 revenue of only $98 million to $99 million, but the actual numbers came in significantly higher at $102.5 million. A similar beat in Q4 would bring the actual revenue numbers closer to or even above analyst estimates at $111 million. Even more interesting is that the company guided up the full-year EBITDA forecast from an average of $68 million to a new level of $70 million. Investors should use any sell-off to get into the leading online consumer review site."
2587615,60151,2014-10-23T08:35:43-04:00,"Yelp beat on both the top and bottom lines, but management gave a disappointing growth outlook.This quarterly report cements my view that Yelp's business model is not conducive to growth.I previously discussed that the influx of competition would lead to decelerating revenue growth.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) reported earnings after hours Wednesday, and has fallen roughly 10% after hours. Even though Yelp beat both on the top and bottom lines, the weak guidance given by management has triggered a sell-off. Yelp reported revenue of $102.5 million (67% y/y increase) beating estimates by $3.5 million. Analysts were expecting EPS of $0.03 and Yelp reported $0.05 per share. However, the consensus Q4 revenue estimate was $111 million and management has guided for $107-108 million.The fourth quarter revenue growth that management guided for represents a 52% y/y increase, which indicates decelerating growth. With a forward PE ratio of nearly 150, that is clearly not a good sign for investors. Moreover, a number of competitors such as OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN), GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), Foursquare, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have entered the fray and will likely compress margins and stymie revenue growth for Yelp.In my previous article, ""Yelp: Investors Will Soon Be Calling For Help,"" I opined that Yelp's business model was not conducive to improved profitability and that the influx of competition would prevent Yelp from meeting growth expectations. Local advertising represents roughly 85% of Yelp's total revenue and it relies on community managers to drive growth. This type of expansion is expensive and this will prevent Yelp from seeing much higher margins. Although I do not believe in Yelp's success with its business model, I do caution investors from shorting. Average monthly unique visitors grew 19% y/y to 139 million users, so coupled with a sell-off, Yelp may look like an attractive takeover target. Especially considering Yahoo's (YHOO) recent windfall from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and its appetite for new growth. I suggest sitting on the sidelines with Yelp."
2586635,67313,2014-10-23T03:06:09-04:00,YELP beat on both EPS and revenue but guidance was light. Stock fell -12% AH.User metrics and engagement continue to see sharp deceleration.Prefer GOOG and FB among the US internet advertisers.,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) reported a solid set of 3Q14 results with EPS of $0.05 handily beat consensus $0.03 and revenue of $102.5m (+67% y/y) was $3.5m above consensus. Guidance of $107m - $108m was well below consensus $111m, and that drove the stock down -12% afterhours.Source: YahooThe consensus had a lofty expectation going into the quarter and much of the consensus estimates are based on 1) strength in YELP's user engagement and 2) monetization potential. On the first point, consensus expects usage and engagement to remain strong due to its higher quality local content and that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) would not be a material threat to YELP's growth in the near-term. The consensus also believes that YELP's new ad products can enhance the platform's monetization capabilities.Both of these key points rely on one the single biggest assumption of the strength of consumer engagement. Without an engaged user base, YELP essentially operates on a shaky ground and Q3 numbers showed exactly that. Average monthly unique visitors showed a sharp deceleration of +19% in the quarter to 139m, down from +27% in Q2 and +30% in Q1. Mobile MUV also decelerated, growing +46% y/y to 73m after growing +51% in Q2.The only positive was the merchant side where we saw local business accounts maintained a healthy +51% y/y growth, vs +55% y/y in the previous quarter. Reviews growth of +41% also seemed reasonable but the focus was ultimately on user engagement. Without a sustainable user engagement metric, active merchants and the number of reviews may decelerated eventually. That said, the stock would likely to be pressured in the near-term until we see a stabilization or a rebound in engagement metrics.Among the US internet advertisers, I continue to have a positive view on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google . I am avoiding YELP in light of this quarter's result despite the company's upbeat EBITDA guidance."
2804395,22148,2015-01-08T14:22:34-05:00,Yelp faces short-term international traffic issues due to moves by Google.The stock trades at very attractive levels compared to other social media stocks.Yelp continues delivering robust revenue growth even in the oldest markets nearing 10 years old.,"Due to some struggling international growth numbers, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) finds its stock cheap compared to other social media names. Though YELP struggled through a miserable 2014, the ironic part is that the long-term growth story remained mostly intact. Yelp continues to produce explosive growth and its model still presents one of the best ways to attract advertising dollars from local businesses.With the stock ending 2014 around $55 and falling further so far in 2015, the following reasons suggest the recent MKM Partners target of $86 is more than reasonable.Reasons For HopeInvestors were clearly disappointed with Q314 earnings due to issues with traffic growth. Similar to the issues faced by Twitter (NYSE:TWTR), Yelp can highly monetize traffic from its platform, but the concern is that the slow acquisition of new users leaves it vulnerable to other services.For the quarter, Yelp only grew total MUUs (monthly unique users) by 19% to 139 million. The bigger issue was in international segments where growth in mostly newer markets was only 40% YoY to 30 million MUUs. Yelp's CEO, Jeremy Stoppleman, blamed the growth on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) search algorithm changes that impacted traffic, but he made the following key claim on the earnings conference call:The important aspect to understand is that Yelp is only now reaching a minimal amount of local businesses around the globe. For example, the company recently began monetizing in Italy. Asian markets remain years away from selling ads. The amount of local businesses reached during Q3 was only 86,200 out of an estimated 66 million businesses in the markets served by Yelp.As the graphic below from the company's Q3 presentation highlighted, Yelp is still experiencing massive growth in the domestic cohorts started back in 2005 and 2006.Source: Yelp Q314 presentationDespite the short-term impacts to monthly traffic by Google's moves, Yelp is still positioned for long-term growth. The markets remain relatively untapped especially from an advertising perspective.Comparative ValuationsMKM Partners is bullish on Yelp due to the fast growth maintained in the oldest markets. Analyst Rob Sanderson forecasts the company turning into a very profitable business after the startup costs for each new local market are covered by increasing monetization. MKM forecasts EBITDA ramping up to the 50-60% range in the next several years due to the lack of content costs.The $86 target by MKM places a valuation on the stock of roughly 11.6x 2015 revenue estimates of $540 million. Compared to other social media stocks including Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Twitter, LinkedIn (LNKD), and Zillow (NASDAQ:Z), the target price of $86 only places the valuation slightly above the current prices for the comparative stocks.TakeawayClearly, international growth numbers will be key to the long-term valuation potential of Yelp, but the growth numbers in the oldest domestic markets suggest it is trading at an extremely attractive level. If users do eventually find the consumer reviews of Yelp despite the best actions of Google, the stock is headed much higher. The $86 target of MKM Partners appears very reasonable for what we think is a misunderstood and cheap stock."
2586605,70965,2014-10-23T02:58:50-04:00,"Yelp missed on the most important part of their earnings, revenue guidance.Yelp reported EPS of $0.05, which beat the consensus by $0.02.The company also beat on revenue, posting $102.5 million versus estimates of $99 million.","By Parke ShallYelp (NYSE:YELP) reported earnings after the bell Wednesday that failed to impress the street. The stock, which had traded down about a dollar to end the day, found itself knocked down by about 13% well into after hours trading. The $60 level seems to be holding after hours, but we believe the market will reevaluate its stance on Yelp by pre-market trading (similar to the way it did with Yahoo! today) and that Yelp will be trading under $60 at the open on Thursday. Our reasoning for this is relatively simple.First, the report.Yelp reported EPS of $0.05, which beat the consensus by $0.02. The company also beat on revenue, posting $102.5 million versus estimates of $99 million. It was the guidance, however, that failed to impress the street. Seeking Alpha expanded on the report:We can look at the EBITDA guidance to place a fair multiple on Yelp for this year. Then, we can talk about why the outlook for this company is so important and seemingly the only thing dragging it down after hours.We see lots of Yelp bulls online posting, ""the company beat on both lines, why is it tanking?"" There's a simple reason for that.The interesting thing about companies like Yelp is that the guidance means a everything. The way that this company is valued essentially leaves little or zero margin for error when it comes to continuing the company's growth heading into the next couple of years. Yelp the company isn't really making a ton of money. Yelp the stock is expensive because the possibility of Yelp making significant amounts of money going forward is large, if they can meet their guidance.Yelp's guidance for the year means that the company is looking to post EBITDA of about $1 per share. This means that Yelp's current price (even at $60), gives the company a price/EBITDA ratio of somewhere around 60.Because Yelp is trading at a P/EBITDA ratio that is way high, the entire price of the stock is help up by the company's future prospects. If there's one thing you can't do as a high P/E stock, its miss guidance. No one cares about what you did in the quarter past, that was already priced in during last quarter's guidance. The only thing people want to know is how the company is going to perform this coming quarter. Yelp says they're going to miss revenue, and we see a corresponding 13% drop off in the stock's price.Although Yelp did up their full year number, we're extremely cautious about the revenue guidance number missing. These types of stocks need to be kept on a short leash and we're guessing tomorrow, especially if the market has a down day, a lot of people will unload Yelp pushing it into the $50's."
2513235,72385,2014-09-22T16:30:48-04:00,Yelp's recent sell-off makes it a more attractive acquisition target for larger internet companies like Yahoo and Facebook.Yelp's rapid expansion in terms of revenue and monthly average users makes it especially attractive for internet companies that are searching for growth.An acquisition of Yelp might require too much in terms of absorption costs and too high a multiple in terms of venture pricing to be justifiable for these companies.,"Yelp's (NYSE:YELP) attractiveness as an acquisition target is often discussed in the investment literature these days and the stock periodically makes substantial leaps on the basis of news about other, similar kinds of companies being acquired. The stock's selloff over the last couple of weeks will no doubt only increase the speculation. In this article I intend briefly to investigate the possibility of Yelp being acquired, and, ultimately, to dispel any unfounded conclusions that hopeful (and bullish) investors might be entertaining about the ease with which an acquiring company might be able to integrate Yelp into its ecosystem. While it is very hard of course to make a guess as to what is going on in the inner sanctums of corporate boardrooms of potential Yelp acquirers these days, nevertheless it is at the same time not all that difficult to detail some of the potential benefits and pitfalls that a potential Yelp acquirer would be looking at in making its decision. First I will look at some of the upsides to a potential acquisition of Yelp, then at some of the obstacles, and finally at a brief list of some of Yelp's potential acquirers.Upsides to an AcquisitionYelp is of course in the life services business, providing the online community with listings of local merchants - accompanied by the reviews of users. The company's main review base seems to be restaurant reviews. The major upside to a bid for Yelp by any potential acquirer is of course that the company is still in rapid growth mode. This is evident both from its widespread presence in large American cities (63, as of Q2 2014) and also its fast international expansion. The company's rapid growth mode is also manifested in its revenue ramp-up, which has gone from $48M in 2010, to $83M in 2011, to $138M in 2012, and $233M in 2013 (Q2 of 2014 was $89M). And finally, the rapid growth of the company is also clear from its expansion in monthly unique visitors. As of Q2, 2014, this number was about 138 million, up from 108 million in Q2 2013, 78 million in Q2 2012, 52 million in Q2 2011, and 33 million in Q2 2010.As for longer-term kinds of considerations for an acquisition of Yelp, and here I'm speaking anecdotally, many young people in my experience are turning more and more to online review services like Yelp rather than relying on the word-of-mouth recommendations that older generations still employ. Whatever the cause of this trend - whether it is because the society is becoming more individualized and less communal, or whether it is just because the lives of young people are moving more and more online - Yelp does seem to be in the right location, commercially speaking, to capitalize on these trends. Sheryl Sandberg has characterized local advertising and small business as the ""holy grail"" of the online advertising market, and Yelp more than any other recent internet company appears to be sitting right on top of this ideal.Downsides to an AcquisitionEven in spite of the recent sell-off, the most substantial downside to an acquisition of Yelp is still the bloated size of its total market capitalization. On a traditional valuation basis, Yelp is incredibly expensive. According to Yahoo Finance, its P/S is 16.99 and its P/B is 9.877 (P/B probably does not so much matter with an online company like Yelp).YELP PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsThe company's current market cap is still over $5B, and given the premiums which other acquisitions have fetched in recent months it is likely that any acquiring company would have to pay somewhere in the region of $8-10 billion for Yelp.YELP Market Cap data by YChartsI have arrived at this number on the basis of an inspection of other recent acquisitions in the startup internet space. For instance, the recent acquisition that was most like a potential Yelp acquisition was Open Table, which was acquired by Priceline (PCLN) for $2.6 billion in cash - at $103 per share in cash it was a 46% premium over Open Table's previous share price. Other internet acquisitions of high-flyers, such as Facebook's Whatsapp acquisition and its Oculus acquisition, were for similar premiums: Facebook purchased Whatsapp for $16B and $2B for Oculus. Needless to say, an $8-10B acquisition would be an enormous bite to swallow for almost any company and impossible to fund except for those companies that are flush with an incredible amount of cash or a stock price that is very strong and capable of being used right now as acquisition capital.Another downside for any potential Yelp acquirers is that the company's expansion, while still rapid, is nevertheless not nearly as rapid as it was just a year or two ago. The growth in terms of percentages of monthly unique visitors is slowing rapidly, as is the growth in terms of percentages of Yelp's revenue. And the company is far from being profitable on anything like a stable basis, as is shown by its SG&A expenses and its net income.YELP SG&A Expense (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsYELP Net Income data by YChartsPotential AcquirersThe potential candidate companies that would in all likelihood in practice have very little reason to make an acquisition bid for Yelp are several: Priceline (PCLN), which has recently acquired Yelp competitor Open Table; Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which was turned down when it made a $500 million acquisition offer in 2009; and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which does not seem to be as interested as other companies in the social media side of the web.The most obvious acquiring company that seems to be on the minds of a lot of analysts right now is Yahoo (YHOO), which is flush with cash following the Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) IPO last week. The advantage to Yahoo of acquiring Yelp will be that it will be able to add to its conglomerate of different holdings a company that is still in its fast revenue growth phase and that is much trendier as a brand name among the internet-using public than Yahoo itself. The major disadvantages for Marissa Mayer and company to a Yelp acquisition are that Yelp would be such a large company to swallow and that the growth at Yelp is slowing at a substantial rate. Yahoo of course has stagnated in terms of advertising revenue and monthly unique users, so Yelp's growth, however much it is slowing, would be a welcome change for the folks in Sunnyvale.Right now of course there is a lot of further speculation in the investment literature about what might happen to Yahoo in general and especially about the possibility that Alibaba might acquire Yahoo as the easiest way of dealing with Yahoo's extensive Alibaba stock holdings and large excess cash pile. Undoubtedly if this sort of a plan were in the works then the executives at Yahoo would not be interested in a Yelp acquisition. I cannot imagine why Alibaba (or any conglomerate affiliate of Alibaba) would be interested in a Yelp acquisition, but then again Alibaba did apparently try to make a bid for Snapchat earlier this year.A Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) acquisition would from a certain point of view be more sensible, if, say, Facebook were to use its richly-valued stock to fund such a venture. The advantage to such an acquisition for Facebook would be that it would immediately provide Facebook with exposure to local business markets and to advertising possibilities through Facebook's vast user network. The major disadvantage would be that it is unclear how Facebook would integrate Yelp into its existing platform. Zuckerberg has been focused with great intensity on unbundling the Facebook conglomerate and any effort to include Yelp in the Facebook interface would of course be a reversal of this trend. My own view is in fact that Facebook is probably uninterested right now in a Yelp acquisition because it has been working so hard in recent months to develop its own internal advertising resources within the Facebook platform.At the end of the day in my opinion an acquisition of Yelp at its current level of market capitalization and lack of profitable cash flows would be a foolish thing for any of the companies that I have listed to do. But I also thought that the Open Table acquisition by Priceline was foolish and I certainly do not know what is going on inside the heads of different corporate managers and boards of directors. I'm not by any means pretending in this article to be detailing what will happen in the future to Yelp in terms of an actual acquisition. My aim is the more modest one of simply listing a few of the benefits and drawbacks that would accompany an acquisition of Yelp by the kinds of companies that I have listed. The point is that, given the frequency with which the possibility of a Yelp acquisition is being tossed around these days, it would probably be of benefit to individual investors to think through for themselves the advantages and disadvantages of a Yelp bid from the perspective of some potential Yelp acquirers."

        The consumer review site still has a large untapped market.
        Yelp isn't cheap on normal valuation metrics, but the likelihood of 50% revenue growth makes the stock appealing heading into 2015.","With the recent volatility in the market and particularly in Yelp (NYSE:YELP), investors need to start looking forward to the prospects for 2015. With a customer base that benefits greatly from lower oil prices, the consumer review site appears destined for fast growth. As well, Yelp has a scarcity value with a level of online content that can't be matched or recreated. The company ended Q214 with 61 million cumulative reviews growing at a 44% YoY clip that a startup can't hope to match.Investors see the stock as expensive based on current year revenue, but here are a couple of reasons why the stock is headed higher with plenty of tailwinds besides lower oil prices that will help customers spend more on ads.Business Category ReviewsThe most reviewed business categories on Yelp are by far Shopping and Restaurants. At a combined 42% of total reviews, these two categories account for the majority of ad revenue. Along with other categories including Auto, Beauty & Fitness, Nightlife, and Travel & Hotel, over 70% of the reviews cover business categories that benefit from lowering fuel costs to consumers.Source: Yelp Q214 investor presentationMostly Untapped MarketThe incredible part of the Yelp story is that the local business market is still relatively untapped by the company. The company estimates that the local markets that it focuses on has over 66 million local businesses. Yelp has roughly 79,900 active business accounts at the end of Q214 and only a fraction of those advertise on the website.Source: YELP Q214 investor presentationAccording to the BIA/Kelsey report noted by the company, only a relatively small amount of local ad spend is even online. The estimate is that the projected 2016 spend of $145 billion on advertising by local businesses will only include $37 billion will be online.TakeawayThe focus of consumer reviews on business categories that benefit from lower oil prices and a large untapped market opportunity makes Yelp a compelling buy at the current position. At roughly 8.7x 2015 revenue estimates, the stock isn't particularly cheap, but it has the above catalysts that should push revenue even higher. Remember that with the thesis that lower oil prices will boost the revenues and ad spending of local restaurants and retail locations, it will help push the revenue growth rate to at least 50% for next year.Looking into 2015, Yelp has plenty of catalysts along with the benefits of lower oil prices to propel the stock higher."
2508455,24580,2014-09-19T17:11:23-04:00,"Yelp shares have a consensus analysts’ price target of $89.65, suggesting 18% upside to current price.BIA/Kesley estimates that local online ad spending will grow at a CAGR of 13.6% from $31.7 billion in 2014 to $52.7 billion in 2018.Yelp has a total addressable market of 76 million local businesses, out of which 53 are in the Americas and Europe.For mature markets, Yelp’s ARPALB clocks in at $5,493, whereas it’s only $377 for new markets (companies whose listings are less than 5 years old).","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is one of the momentum stocks that have gone through a rollercoaster this year, starting with a deep slide early in the year, followed by a half-hearted rally in May, then the current selloff. It appears as if investors are having a hard time making up their minds how to treat the shares, which is perfectly understandable. For starters, Yelp's shares sport a valuation that's hard to swallow: Price-to-Sales multiple of 19.4, shares trading at almost 190 times next year's consensus average earnings, compared to the industry whose average trailing 12-months PE multiple is 35.YELP data by YChartsYelp shares, however, have a consensus analysts' price target of $89.65, suggesting 18% upside to current price. Despite the optimism, there are some key reasons why Yelp shares might not have a lot of short to mid-term upside potential. Here are the key ones:Slow Growth in Local Ads BusinessLocal ads business makes up approximately 80% of Yelp's estimated value. The key metrics for this segment are ARPU (or in this case average revenue per active local business account) and the total number of active local business accounts. BIA/Kesley estimates that local online ad spending will grow at a CAGR of 13.6% from $31.7 billion in 2014 to $52.7 billion in 2018.Source: BIA KesleyYelp has a total addressable market of 76 million local businesses, out of which 53 are in the Americas and Europe. That number certainly looks impressive. What's not so impressive is the fact that only 79,900, or just 0.1% of listed businesses were active in the second quarter of 2014. The number of claimed businesses that do not pay for the company's premium services stands at more than 1.8 million.Yelp's conversion rate of claimed businesses to active businesses is highest in mature markets (regions where the company has been active for more than five years). Yelp's international traffic is expanding at more than twice the rate of the domestic market. The base effect is likely to limit the active business listing growth to around 30% or less.Yelp's average revenue per active local business (ARPALB) carries even more weight in this thesis. Yelp says the monetization rate of a region or city increases with time as more businesses sign up for its premium services such as call to action to promote their businesses and dedicated webpages. There is a big difference for ARPALB in mature markets and new markets. For mature markets, Yelp's ARPALB clocks in at $5,493, whereas it's only $377 for new markets (companies whose listings are less than five-years-old).Most of Yelp's future growth is likely to come from new regions such as Latin America, which do not have as much money to spend on digital ads as businesses in its core America and Europe markets. This is likely to take a big toll on the company's overall APRALB.Deals Revenue Growth Not ImpressiveYelp generates revenue from its Deal, Partnership and Other Services (DPO) division through any transactions that occur directly on its website. Yelp's deal platform allows merchants to promote themselves as well as offer discounted goods and services on a real-time basis to their customers on Yelp's website and mobile app. The company acts as an agent for these services and charges a fee.Yelp's DPO revenue grew at a CAGR of 32% from $7 million in 2011 to $12.3 million in 2013, after the company forged partnerships with OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) and Orbitz (NYSE:OWW). This seemed like a good start and many investors expected the division to become a major revenue contributor to Yelp's top line in the space of a few years. But growth has slowed down considerably as other companies such as Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and LivingSocial have their own daily deal services which are popular and widely used.Luckily for Yelp (and its investors), all is not lost. Recently, the company introduced new initiatives such as call to action and delivery platform so as to close the loop between discovering a business on Yelp and transacting with the business. Yelp's new services are likely to become a major revenue driver. The new platform allows users to browse businesses and place their orders directly from Yelp's website. The service streamlines user experience with easy shopping and also supplements DPO revenue through the fees Yelp charges for orders placed directly from its website. This new service has a lot of revenue-generation potential, and can grow to as much as $100 million in four years' time. If things pan out this way, then revenue from the new platform will be enough to offset the weakness being shown by the DPO division.Expansion to Impact MarginsYelp has always had a problem of high growth in its operating expenses. The company has had to incur high operating expenses to fuel rapid its growth. Yelp's operating expenses in 2013 were $242 million, 103% of its overall expenses. SG&A (Selling, General and Administrative) expenses are 72% of revenue while R&D expenses account for 16% of revenue. Without a very aggressive expansion plan, Yelp's SG&A expenses are likely to fall to around 45% of revenue by 2018. But Yelp is rapidly expanding into new markets. The company recently entered the Latin America market and Chile. Continued expansion is good for the company's top line growth, but is likely to negatively impact its margins considerably since these markets might require comparable SG&A costs as its developed markets yet are likely to bring in much less revenue per dollar spent on customer acquisition costs.Competition to Limit Revenue GrowthYelp is lucky in that it enjoys a first-mover advantage in social local review services. Large online companies such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Yahoo (YHOO) now offer competing services and can pose a real threat to Yelp if they start leveraging their existing huge user bases to compete with Yelp.What about Angie's List?I thought I might as well throw in a word or two about Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI), since its shares have been cut in half since the beginning of the year. The shares have lost more than 60% over the last 12 months, and trade at a price-to-sales ratio of just 2 compared to Yelp's 19. Angie's List has been in the review business much longer than Yelp, but is currently struggling to stay relevant. Angie's biggest problems can be summarized as:Angie's revenue growth rate is 33% compared to Yelp's 65%. For investors looking for value in the business review space, Care.com might be a good investment. Its shares are relatively cheap trading at around 3.8 times revenue. The company provides a platform for people seeking for caregivers such as nannies, the elderly, pet watchers, and so on. Care.com's members grew 44% during the last quarter to 10.7 million. Caregivers are willing to pay a fee to find a job while users are willing to pay a fee to find a caregiver with reviews."

It has broken even in the second quarter of this year, which is a milestone for a growth technology company.Yelp's risk comes from intense competition, but it has a solid moat to help it outperform. Yelp is a strong buy with a target price of $100 in 2015.","I believe Yelp, Inc. (NYSE:YELP) is a strong buy because it's a growth star, has a great business, and has huge potential to grow. And it has taken off to help monetize its valuable ""basic life service"" platform. Yelp was trading at $80.32 with a market cap of $5.79 billion as of Aug. 21, 2014. I believe the chance that the company grows to be a $100 billion company is quite good.Source: Google Finance.To support my conclusion, I want to examine the following facts and reasons:Awesome BusinessBasic life services are the most important and necessary things for everyone, so a platform of such services will enjoy an enormous sustainable business. Yelp is such a platform. Yelp's main business is providing listings of local merchants with users' reviews of them. Yelp is most known for restaurant reviews, but its database also covers other basic life services -- including hair salons, spa and beauty salons, plumbing, clinics, events, etc. According to its Q2 2014 report (Form 10-Q), it is present in 63 big cities in the U.S. and 26 international countries. It has been rapidly expanding internationally. Yelp is essentially a bridge between users and businesses.Based on user reviews, consumers can choose the most desirable products or services. Businesses can advertise themselves, as well as learn about users' tastes, interests, purchasing habits from previous online behavior, and -- perhaps most importantly -- their location. About 68% of consumers go to social networking sites to read reviews. Based on the reviews, people make purchase decisions. About 35% of Yelp users visit a searched business within 24 hours of searching Yelp. People who review a business on Yelp are very likely to make a purchase within a week. Yelp's social networking function can further facilitate the review and transaction.Yelp is looking to take things a step further. It has been trying to become a one-stop-shop life service platform, on which users can search, place orders, reserve appointments, and make transactions. Yelp wants to close the loop to create the easiest consumption experience. It launched Yelp Platform to introduce a food ordering and delivery service. Yelp also allows some partner businesses to make deals on its Yelp pages, a move that can eventually transform the company from an informational service into an e-commerce powerhouse.I believe Yelp has a very good chance to develop into one of the most important life platforms for the whole world.Solid Moat1. Yelp is growing quickly; it has built a huge database. According to the Q2 2014 report, Yelp has approximately 137.8 million unique visitors who use its website on a monthly average basis, of which 67.9 million are mobile unique visitors. Its users have contributed a total of approximately 61.3 million cumulative reviews. There are 1.75 million claimed local business locations and 80,000 active local business accounts.Source: Statista.com.2. Yelp is global. According to the Q2 2014 report, Yelp is active in 61 cities in the United States and 63 cities in 26 countries internationally, encompassing 15 languages. For the three months ended June 30, 2014, revenue generated internationally accounts for 3% of the company's total revenue, which implies huge potential for international expansion.3. Yelp is big on mobile, which is an advantageous differentiator compared to other web-based services. According to an article on LocalVox.com, during the third quarter of 2013 the Yelp app was used by 11.2M unique devices -- and 62% of the searches came from mobile devices. The app generated 27M clicks for directions and 19M calls to businesses. Many competitors, like Google Plus, do not know how to manage platforms and they are slow in the mobile segment. Yelp has launched a revamped ""Nearby"" feature that shows recommendations based on time of day, the social graph, and newly opened businesses, which can help increase location-based business opportunities.4. Yelp has high-quality reviews. Yelp works hard to maintain a high quality of reviews. According to Yelp management, it filters out most fake reviews, which is roughly 20% of all reviews.5. Yelp has taken off to monetize its database. It broke even in the second quarter of this year, which is a milestone for a growing technology company. The company accelerated with respect to monetizing its database with its new booking and deal sales services, while it keeps working hard to sell more advertisements to businesses.6. The company has strong management. Management is very capable and are doing the right thing. Most executive managers -- like Chairman Max R. Levchin, a co-founder of PayPal, and CEO Jeremy Stoppleman -- are very devoted and experienced entrepreneurs. They are passionate about changing the world through Yelp. They have been working very hard to improve the business.Surprise Financials and ForecastAccording to the Q2 2014 report, the company has broken even for the first time in history with a net income of $2,743,000 and EPS of $0.04 in the second quarter, compared to a loss of $878,000 last year. The adjusted EBITDA is $17,244,000, which 122% higher than last year. Q2 2014 revenue surged 61% to reach $88.8 million.Currently, most of its income comes from local advertising (85%) while brand advertising makes up only 10%. I believe Yelp can make significant commissions if the direct transactions ramp up. The major costs and expenses are sales and marketing, which make up around 55% of the total costs. That means the company works hard to improve sales. With the reservation, deal sales, and revenue sharing businesses picking up, revenue resources will be diversified and the top line can grow more rapidly.Management expects revenue for Q3 2014 to be $98 to $99 million, which exceeds analyst estimates of $95.4 million. We predict that annual revenue will be around $370 million, which translates into a P/S ratio of 13 as of July 31, 2014. The P/S ratio is higher than the industry average of 1.46, but significantly lower than the sector average of 288. Yelp has very high current ratio of around 15 with no long-term debt, which makes it easy for the company to expand, develop products, and acquire more companies.New Developments and Potential1. Booking: Yelp launched its restaurant booking services by cooperating with OpenTable in 2013. Yelp Reservations is a tool that allows businesses in the restaurant and nightlife categories to take online reservations, and added the ability for consumers to message business owners directly through Yelp. Yelp might stop its partnership with OpenTable as OpenTable has been acquired by Priceline.com. The acquisition of SeatMe, Inc. in 2014 will help boost booking business. SeatMe, Inc. is a cloud restaurant booking and floor management system. It has table management, online reservations, wait list, guestbook, and other advanced functions. Yelp also tested food ordering and delivery services through partnerships with Eat24 and Delivery.com, which can expand quickly as more people are willing to order food at home and have it delivered.2. Transactions: The Yelp platform allows consumers to make transactions directly on Yelp through partnerships with third parties. This function will definitely help Yelp to become an e-commerce platform, which is one of the most lucrative businesses. Yelp can take food delivery transactions and book spa appointments, and it will expand to scheduling yoga sessions and making dentist appointments in the rest of 2014.3. Revenue sharing: Yelp has started sharing revenue with some local businesses. Yelp Deals allow merchants to promote themselves and offer discounted goods and services on a real-time basis to consumers directly on its website and mobile app. It earns a fee on Yelp Deals for acting as an agent in these transactions, which it records on a net basis and include in revenue upon a consumer's purchase of the deal.4. Alliance and M&A: Yelp has started building alliances with other platforms like Yahoo, a move that can help Yelp to grow its user base faster. Yelp also strives to acquire more companies, especially internationally.Risks1. Its relationship with business owners is a mixed bag. While many business clients see the value in paying to have ads for their establishments pop up during consumer searches, disgruntled parties have helped foster the notion that those businesses that don't advertise with Yelp will see negative reviews rise in prominence over positive reviews. As a consequence, Yelp is sued by many businesses with less favorable reviews. Yelp needs to properly handle the litigation and improve communications with those business clients.2. Competition from Google, Facebook and Foursquare. Google, Facebook, Foursquare, and a bevy of smaller startups are taking on Yelp with their own search features, which poses a big threat to Yelp. However, CEO Stoppelman said that he is not concerned by Google and Facebook's threats. Google and Facebook are not focused exclusively on local businesses, which gives Yelp an advantage, and smaller companies don't have what he says is the same breadth and depth of content.3. Competition against Opentable. I believe Opentable can be a big concern for the burgeoning reservation service of Yelp. Yelp launched the restaurant reservations function with the cooperation of OpenTable, which is a leader is restaurant booking. Yelp has to count on its own reservation system SeatMe after OpenTable was acquired by Priceline.com. As a new startup, SeatMe only has limited restaurant clients. With the support of Priceline.com, OpenTable might extend its business from restaurant reservation to reviews and other life services that Yelp is doing. Fortunately, OpenTable is known for being expensive and clunky, so it has certainly left an opportunity for SeatMe to catch up. Yelp has started attacking OpenTable by launching SeatMe reservation and table management services at very competitive prices.Compared to competitor OpenTable, SeatMe only charges $99 a month and waives things such as the setup fee, cover fee, web access fee, etc. SeatMe does not charge reservation or per-diner fees to restaurants like some other restaurant reservation services. Businesses are simply required to pay a low monthly flat rate, which is much cheaper than OpenTable. The service does charge initiation and licensing fees, plus a per-reservation fee to restaurants.Source: SeatMe.Yelp.com.SeatMe excels in some unique features like greater flexibility for owners, thanks to its apps compatibility with smartphones and tablets, and guestbooks that keep track of customers' tastes and schedules. Another key feature of SeatMe is its iPad software portal for special occasion event ticketing, as well as regular restaurant reservations, wait lists, and floor management. OpenTable also has a manager for iPad software that is helpful, as well as in-depth restaurant reviews, menus, and holiday promotions.In short, I believe Yelp has a great opportunity to grab business from OpenTable as SeatMe's technology is good, its price is very competitive, and it can develop new clients quickly through Yelp's huge established restaurant clients. However, Yelp has to work very hard and invest a lot to achieve that goal.4. Low profit margin. According to the Q2 2014 report, Yelp's gross margin is as high as 93.4%, but its net income margin is only 3%. 68.76% of its revenue is spent on selling, general and administration. I understand that Yelp needs to spend a lot in generating new business clients, but management definitely needs to improve its efficiency and boost more profitable businesses, like booking.5. Buyout Rumors. People suspect Yelp might be a buyout target for giant IT companies. I think the likelihood of acquisition is very low. Yelp rejected a $500 million acquisition offer from Google in 2009. Yelp has become more confident as a standalone company as it has great assets and huge potential to become a giant platform. I think Yelp is going to acquire more companies or build alliances.Institutional InvestorsAccording to Nasdaq, institutions own 95.8% of the company as of Aug. 21, 2014. The largest institutional shareholders include Invesco Ltd., Vanguard Group, Inc., and Allianz Asset Management AZ. Soros Fund Management LLC bought 50,000 shares on March 31, 2014, at a cost of $82.85.Price Movement and ValuationYelp's stock has a YTD gain of 60.22% as of Aug. 21, 2014, after it came down from a historical high of $97.8 on March 6, 2014. It has broken through its 200-SMA, which is around $73. Most of the 15 research institution analysts who follow Yelp give it a strong buy rating with a consensus target price of $89. My target price is $100 in the first half of 2015, based on the forecast of its rapid growth and accommodating U.S. monetary environments. In conclusion, I think Yelp is a strong buy."

However, we expect its contribution to increase to 8% by 2021.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is set to release its Q3 2014 earnings on Wednesday, October 22nd. While the company continues to report good growth in its core local ads business, the pace of this growth is directly related to the duration of its presence in the regions where Yelp operates. In the last few years, Yelp has expanded to regions outside the U.S. where the purchasing power of businesses and users is low compared to the U.S. Therefore, we believe that the pace of local ads growth will slow down as cohorts within the U.S. mature, and revenues from newer regions kicks in. Therefore, in this earnings announcement, growth in the local ads business will be the key focal point, and will give us a fair indication of the expected revenue growth in the coming quarters. Furthermore, we will continue to monitor revenue growth from mobile devices and the Deal, Partnership and Other services (DPO) business as we expect the revenues from these services to form a significant portion of division's revenues in the coming quarters.Outlook for Q3 and 2014For Q3 FY14, the company expects revenues to be in the $98 - $99 million range, representing growth of approximately 61% compared to the third quarter of 2013. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $18 million to $19 million. For the full year, Yelp has announced an improvement in guidance and projects net revenue to be in the $372 - $375 million range, while adjusted EBITDA should be in the $67 - $69 million range.Growth In Local Ads Business To ContinueThe local ads business currently accounts for around 80% of Yelp's stock value, in our view, and is its biggest revenue source. During Q2 FY14, active local business accounts grew by 55% year-over-year to approximately 80,000. The primary drivers for Yelp's account growth are its international expansion efforts and the cumulative increase in reviews on the Yelp site for its existing markets. The company has a total addressable market (NYSE:TAM) of 73 million local businesses in the world, of which 53 million are present in North America, Europe and New Zealand. As the company continues to expand in international markets, we expect the active local business accounts to grow in the coming quarters. Furthermore, we expect average revenue per active business account, which is a function of the duration of Yelp's services in a region, to grow from $2,890 in 2013 to $3,250 by 2021, as the monetization rate in older cohorts increases. With this earnings announcement, we will continue to monitor these performance metrics to ascertain whether the company will be able to maintain its growth trajectory going forward.Revenue Share From International Operations To IncreaseRecently, the company added Hong Kong, which is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, into its addressed markets. As a result of this and other expansions, international traffic, which grew over 80% year-over-year to approximately 31 million unique visitors on a monthly average basis in Q2, has become an important indicator for Yelp's expected revenue growth. Revenue from international markets now contributes nearly 30% to Yelp's top line and at some point will exceed revenues from the U.S. While it is still early for Yelp to report any significant traction in revenues from international markets, we continue to closely monitor the revenue from these markets as it will help us in ascertaining the monetization rate in newer regions.Growth In Mobile Ads Metrics In FocusAlthough Yelp has been successful in expanding its local ads business by inorganic and organic means, it still needs to monetize its properties more effectively to increase its overall revenue. While Yelp has been using display ads to monetize its websites, it launched display ads for its mobile platform last year (2013). Yelp reported that 50% of unique visitors (~68 million monthly users) used mobile devices for accessing Yelp's services in Q2 FY14, and 40% of new reviews came from mobile devices. Considering the rampant growth in the usage of mobile devices, we expect the mobile platform to become a major revenue driver for Yelp's brand ads division. We expect that Yelp will continue to report growth in monthly mobile users in Q3, and are closely following this number in the upcoming earnings announcement.Growth In Revenues From Deals PlatformYelp's deal, partnership and other services (DPO) division contributes 5.6% to its value. Currently, Yelp generates revenue from this division through any transaction that might occur on its website. Yelp's deals platform allows merchants to promote themselves, and offer discounted goods and services on a real-time basis to consumers directly on Yelp's website and mobile app. Yelp charges a fee on Yelp Deals for acting as an agent in these transactions. In Q2, Yelp reported 27% year-over-year growth in deals revenues to $4 million. In a move to diversify its revenue stream, Yelp expanded its services in 2013 by introducing new features. These include the Call to Action program, which lets a business promote its services by offering discounts, as well as a new delivery platform to serve its clients. If these delivery services gain traction among Yelp users, Yelp's DPO division can be an important growth driver going forward. In this earnings announcement, the focus will be on revenue growth from these services. Currently, Yelp's DPO division contributes only 6% to total revenues. However, we expect its contribution to increase to 8% by 2021.Our price estimate for Yelp stands at $60.44, which is 11% below its current market price. Disclosure: No positions."
2388285,20521,2014-08-06T10:36:38-04:00,,"The growing importance of local review sites like Yelp (NYSE:YELP) can no longer be underestimated. Recent studies have revealed that for every additional star that is earned on Yelp by a local business, the business sees a 5% increase in revenues. The research has found that positive Yelp reviews saw revenues of independent restaurants improve while taking share away from branded, restaurant chains.Yelp's FinancialsThis is also helping Yelp improve their financials as the company delivered a rather surprising profit this quarter. Second quarter revenues grew 61% over the year to $88.8 million, ahead of the market's expectations of $86.4 million. Yelp reported an EPS of $0.04 compared with a loss of $0.01 per share a year ago and the market's forecast of a loss of $0.03 per share.Among operating metrics, cumulative reviews grew 44% over the year to 61 million. Average monthly unique visitors to their site improved 27% to 138 million with mobile users growing 51% to 68 million. At the end of the quarter, Yelp's active business accounts grew 55% to 79,900.For the current quarter, Yelp forecast revenues of $98 million-$99 million with an adjusted EBITDA of $18-$19 million. They expect to end the year with revenues of $372 million-$375 million and an adjusted EBITDA of $67 million-$69 million.Yelp's Market ExpansionYelp continued to improve mobile and user engagement initiatives. Recently, they enhanced their messaging feature so that the users can now connect with each other. The private messaging has been extended for the community to be able to interact through desktop and mobile platforms. Recently, they also added the ability for businesses to be able to post video clips to their listings.Last quarter, Yelp launched the Message the Business feature that lets consumers connect with businesses directly. Consumers can now ask businesses questions through Yelp. For restaurants, Yelp Message for Business helps consumers make reservations to the restaurants as well. This move would have helped Yelp compete better with restaurant reservation service OpenTable, which was recently acquired by Priceline.As part of their market expansion efforts, they recently launched their services in Japan and Argentina besides opening an office in Ireland. Yelp is now available in 27 countries worldwide.Yelp's WorriesBut all is not rosy at Yelp. Yelp recently complained about how the search giant Google is dishing up Google+ results first instead of Yelp's. According to the report, even if the user typed Yelp in the search query, there were cases when Google's search results showed the results through Google+ instead of showing the Yelp page. Yelp filed a complaint with the EU antitrust authority which is already evaluating similar complaints by other service providers.Additionally, recent reports about Yelp highlight how the company keeps reviews more positive as it sends away negative reviews so that the restaurants are not affected. Yelp's automated recommendation software weeds out reviews that it determines as not relevant. Their internal reports suggest that nearly 25% of the reviews that are submitted to Yelp are not published as they are identified as either being biased or because they were being mass posted from a single IP address.Their stock is trading at $68.23 with a market capitalization of $4.9 billion. It touched a high of $101.75 in March this year. The acquisition of OpenTable helped spur the stock upwards and it rose 14% in June, but the interest seems to have waned since then."
2383295,69925,2014-08-05T14:31:11-04:00,Yelp has the ability to become the preeminent mobile search app for all local businesses.Yelp has competitive advantage over other local mobile business search apps.Yelp is now a more attractive acquisition target.Analyst price targets raised post-strong Q214.,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is considered the internet's ""yellow-pages"" and will become the preeminent mobile search app for all local businesses. Yelp's competitive advantage is that the company is not limited only to the restaurant business as other local search apps. Apps such as OpenTable, Inc. (NASDAQ:OPEN) and GrubHub, Inc. (NYSE:GRUB) are limited to the restaurant industry. OpenTable is limited to restaurants that require a table reservation, these typically being fine dining establishments. OpenTable's market is limited to a small percentage of restaurants considering that the restaurant industry trend is for casual dining not requiring table reservations. The larger metropolitan areas are where most fine dining restaurants are located which can geographically limit the expansion of OpenTable. GrubHub is limited to restaurants which offer ""take-out"". Groupon, Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN) offers discount prices for various business types.Yelp could integrate similar restaurant applications into their business model platform for a user to reserve a table at a restaurant (YELP Reservations/SeatMe), order food online, and offer customer discounts (OpenTable, GrubHub, & Groupon); as well as list and locate virtually any business worldwide. Yelp now has thousands of restaurants using YELP Reservations. Yelp's mobile app for local businesses is seamless and extremely easy to use to locate any local business category for example to contact, locate and book an appointment (i.e. dental clinics, dog groomers, spa treatments, and auto repair shops, etc.) all from a user's mobile device. This provides a tremendous combination of value for this company as they expand their services and find ways to monetize their expansion into additional business services.Yellow-Page AdvertisingA user no longer needs to locate the old traditional hard-copy local yellow pages to find information on local businesses. Yelp provides this to users immediately from their mobile devices with the ability to telephone, provide GPS directions, and review user comments. Yelp can expand internationally into areas that never previously offered ""yellow-page"" type advertising or a source of local business contact information. Consider the past difficulties in locating the local listing of businesses in a small remote vacation destination (i.e. scuba diving, golf courses, pharmacy, car rental companies, etc.) or having to tear out a page from an outdated phone book from the hotel or convenient store. Mobile search of local businesses will continue to grow exponentially making ""yellow page"" hardbound books obsolete. Historically, phone book advertising cost business owners many thousands of dollars per listing and marketed to only local customers, not the vast worldwide customer base that mobile advertising offers. Yelp estimated that roughly 25 million businesses exist in both the U.S. and Europe alone, providing tremendous growth potential. In Q214, international traffic grew 80%, monthly mobile unique visitors grew over 50% Y/Y to 68M and approximately 40% of new reviews were written on mobile. Yelp also delivered over 50% of ad impressions on mobile.Q214 Financial PerformanceToday, Yelp is a profitable global company with customers in 27 countries around the world. Yelp reported Q214 results substantially beating on both top and bottom line estimates. Q214 revenue grew a significant 61% Y/Y to $88.8M. Adjusted EBITDA was $17M a 120% increase over Q213. Bottom line the company generated a net income of $2.7M. EPS beat estimates by $.07. Further, management gave Q314 guidance of revenue in the range of $98 million to $99 million which exceeds analyst estimates of $95.4 million. Sales and Marketing expenses dropped by 2% to 54% of revenues vs 56% prior period. Active local business accounts were up 55% Y/Y to 79.9K, which fell short of expectations. They increased about 5,900 sequentially, however analysts were estimating closer to 7,700 merchant heads (primary assumption why the stock price was down 10% post earnings).(Source: Yelp Q214 Earnings)Company Investment RiskYelp currently has a lofty valuation (not uncommon for a high growth company) therefore, investors should consider this stock as a high growth spec stock; or held as a long-term investment permitting future earnings to support a lower P/E ratio.Analyst Price Targets (PT) following Q214 Results· Piper Jaffray - reiterated an Overweight rating raised PT to $90· Suntrust Robinson Humphrey - maintained a Buy rating raised PT to $90· Cantor Fitzgerald - maintained a Buy rating raised PT to $84· Credit Suisse - reiterated an Outperform raised PT to $93· JP Morgan - maintained a Buy rating and a 2015 $100 PT· Needham & Co. - maintained a Buy rating and $93 PT· Pacific Crest - maintained a Buy rating and $95 PT· UBS - maintained a Neutral rating but raised PT to $80· RBC - maintained an Outperform rating and $88 PT· Wunderlich Securities - maintained a Buy rating and $105 PTConclusionYelp will continue to benefit from the expansion of the local mobile search over the coming years with growing mobile device sales and global expansion. The company reported strong Q214 results and raised its full year outlook above analyst expectations. Yelp has experienced tremendous revenue growth of 60%+ in the last 10 consecutive quarters. The local online advertising opportunity is tremendous and as the company continues to expand and innovate with new products such as reservations and other features which may be integrated into their business model platform, Yelp is well positioned to outperform and become the preeminent mobile search app for all local businesses. Yelp is a likely takeover candidate and would be a logical fit for many Large-Cap internet companies looking to expand their local mobile search capabilities. These factors bring me to the conclusion that Yelp represents a compelling investment with the potential for accelerated earnings growth and more attractive now as an acquisition target with a lower market cap ($4.7B) and profitable operations.Disclosure: The author is long YELP.

2365525,56262,2014-07-31T15:03:29-04:00,"Competition from Google will hurt Yelp.A high proportion of Yelp's reviews are fake, which has hurt the company's reputation.Yelp's extremely high CPM makes its business model less sustainable than Google's.Investors should short Yelp.","Local marketplace Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is on a tear as far as revenue growth is concerned, posting a 61% year-over-year jump in the second quarter. However, the same cannot be said about the stock price. Yelp shares have appreciated just 3% in 2014, even though the company has reported rapid growth in its key metrics. It has been consistently reporting losses and is yet to register a profit, and trades at an expensive forward P/E of 206.The wrong strategyYelp has been reporting losses for a while now, and the reason is that it has been spending lavishly to entice advertisers. Although the increasing marketing expense has resulted in consistent double-digit revenue growth, the company is not expected to turn profitable for at least another year. Yelp's current business model on spending lavishly on advertisers and generating lesser money is not sustainable, and the company's share price is destined to fall.Moreover, Yelp is facing tough competition from Google+ Reviews. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) already has an edge over Yelp with its search service that acts like a one-stop shop for users, and has integrated Google+ Reviews across its Google searches and Google Maps. Around 83% of searches were set with Google+ Reviews, promoting the app worldwide.The problem with reviewsReports suggest that one out of every five review on Yelp is fake, hence making it less trustworthy. This is due to the easy and less secure review filter of Yelp, which is easy to bypass. Yelp's review system is unable to detect a fake user if that user is moderately active. On the other hand, Google can track a user on other apps like Google Maps, Gmail, etc. to track and compromise counterfeit accounts. Google's quick and handy search methods make it more preferable than launching an app like Yelp. This is the reason why Google has a large user base. All these factors combined, Google+ reviews will have a stronger hand over Yelp.In addition, Google's advertising program is much better than Yelp's, if you compare cost-per-thousand impressions, or CPM. Advertising cost for Yelp goes as high as $600, which is a big rip-off. Yelp's ads can cost 100-1000 times more on a CPM basis than Google.OpenTable's acquisition is nothing to get excited aboutYelp's share price had fallen almost 45% since March 2014. However, it started growing again on the news of the acquisition of restaurant reservation specialist OpenTable by Priceline (PCLN) for a hefty premium of 46%.This acquisition has made investors believe that Yelp may also be an acquisition target for other companies. However, it is not going to happen. Yelp's valuation is too bloated to consider it as a takeover candidate. As I already said, the company isn't expected to report a profit until next year, and it has a towering forward P/E ratio. In addition, the P/S ratio currently stands at 18.11, which signifies Yelp's ridiculous overvaluation.OpenTable seated over 46 million diners in the first quarter, registering a 25% increase year-over-year. The acquisition by Priceline is, in fact, bad news for Yelp. The acquisition is a perfect fit and will provide OpenTable with financial backing to compete directly against Yelp. As CNN Money recently reported:ConclusionOn top of these negatives, Yelp has a massive short float of 21%. This further goes on to suggest that many investors don't have confidence in the stock. So, I think it is best for investors to avoid Yelp.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Yelp beat estimates and reported revenue of $88.8 million and EPS of $0.04.Although Yelp beat estimates, my bear thesis is intact and the market sentiment seems to be turning that way as well, with it selling off this morning.In my previous article, I opined that investors would soon realize Yelp would not justify its lofty valuation.","Yelp Inc. (NYSE:YELP) reported positive earnings, beating on both top and bottom line estimates, and gave Q3 guidance above analyst estimates. Revenue grew at a prodigious 61% y/y to $88.8 million, which led to EBITDA increasing a staggering 120% y/y. Further, management gave Q3 guidance of revenue in the range of $98 million to $99 million, which exceeds analyst estimates of $95.4 million. The business looks great, but as an investment, it is abhorrent at this valuation.During the quarter, Yelp added 5,900 active local businesses, which is down from the prior quarter, and even includes added businesses from the SeatMe acquisition. This is a red flag, as local business growth is an important revenue driver and it is decelerating already. Decelerating growth while it trades at lofty multiples is alarming. Management expects revenue in 2014 to be between $372 million to $375 million, but the company's market capitalization is $5.4 billion. That premium is substantial and would only be justified if it was experiencing significant accelerating growth, which it certainly is not. Moreover, its forward P/E ratio is an inconceivable 260x at the current trading level.In my previous article ""Yelp Investors Will Soon Be Calling For Help,"" I predicted that investors will soon realize the headwinds Yelp faces and will sell-off. An influx of competition, dearth of international presence, ongoing FTC investigation, and looming costs from restricted stock units and awards will cause Yelp to languish. Yelp is a risky investment that will likely never justify its current trading multiples.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

        The earnings report confirms opinion that Yelp has substantial growth ahead.
        Previous analysis anticipated the company would continue to report fantastic growth as the local advertising market moves to Yelp.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) reported that Q214 revenue surged 61% to reach $88.8 million. The local portion surged 69% over the Q213 numbers. The more exciting numbers were the positive earnings of $0.04 and adjusted EBITDA surging to $17.2 million, compared to $7.8 million for the same period last year. Monthly unique visitors grew 27% to reach approximately 138 million. Q314 guidance of $98 to $99 million exceeds the analyst estimates of $95.4 million. The company now has nearly 80 thousand businesses that subscribe on the platform.Yelp provides a ton of metrics worthy of analysis. The key is that advertisers continue to expand and international remains a large growth opportunity. Yelp previously estimated that roughly 25 million businesses exist in both the U.S. and Europe, providing a long runway of growth.My previous analysis when the stock was sliding to lows in May was for investors to focus on the relative youth of the company and the business. It is only starting to penetrate the user potential and the small business advertiser base. The stock is bouncing around after hours based on concerns about the growth of new business advertisers, but sequential growth of 6,000 isn't a reason to panic. The stock isn't the same bargain around $75 that it was in the original analysis with it bottoming in $50s. With strong guidance, the stock should hold around these levels setting up for a good run later in the year. The stock remains a must own for the ability to capture local advertisers.Disclosure: The author is long YELP. The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.

2426155,41961,2014-08-15T05:34:51-04:00,"Yelp reported solid momentum in Q2 2014 in terms of revenue and earnings growth.
        Yelp core customers continue to be engaged, with ARPA growth and active user growth.
        Yelp continues to remain a long term buy in my portfolio.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) delivered another standout quarter in terms of market traction and continues to provide positive validation to my decision to include it within my growth portfolio.Market OpportunityYelp is one of several players attempting to address the local advertising market. Given the overwhelming dominance of SMB's within the space, conversion of this segment to online advertising has lagged broader market trends, yet the opportunity remains a significant one given the size of the local advertising market.Revenue and profit growthRevenue came in at a significant $88.79 million, up 61.6% from 2Q 2013's $55 million, and exceeding most analyst expectations. Yelp also reported a profit of $0.04 per share, which comfortably exceeded most analysts expectations for a loss.Active business users and ARPU increaseI was particularly encouraged by a couple of metrics that suggest Yelp is providing significant value to core business accounts. Yelp experienced good growth in average revenue per active local business (ARPU), which increased from $312 in Q2 2013 to $330 in the most recent quarter, for a growth of 6.1%. This is indicative of underlying business value provided by the Yelp platform to it's core customer base.Yelp also saw increases in active local business accounts of almost 55.4% from 51,000 accounts to 80,000 in the most recent quarter. This is significant because it represents Yelp accounts who are active revenue generating customers for the company, as opposed to those businesses that are free users. Expansion of the number of active paying businesses is also an indication of the perceived value that Yelp provides.User engagementYelp is ultimately a community based platform and as such is dependent on the active participation and growth of users to provide value and monetization opportunities with businesses.Unique visitors grew 27.8 percent year-over-year to 138 million, with growth in cumulative Yelp user reviews expanding from 42.5M to 62.3M in the recent quarter. This represents growth of 46.5%.Conclusions and Key TakeawaysOverall Yelp reported very solid operational performance and continues to be on track to be a very strong player in the local advertising market. While there were some concerns around the small growth in the addition of new business accounts (only some 6,000 were added last quarter), the fact remains that Yelp is providing value to customers as evidenced by the strong increases in active business accounts and in user ARPU. Also, the significant investments that Yelp has made in sales force headcount should start to pay returns over time as experience and productivity of the sales force improves.I am interested to see what impacts Google's Panda update has on returning relevant Yelp listings versus Google's own results being prioritized. For the moment, this doesn't appear to be much of a concern give the strong growth in unique visitors.Disclosure: The author is long YELP.

2337705,68555,2014-07-24T10:46:11-04:00,"Yelp's revenue is still growing considerably, and the growth in Yelp's numbers of review has outpaced Google.Yelp is expanding globally, and this should further boost Yelp's revenue.The acquisition of Qype is already proving to be beneficial and will add to Yelp's growth in the long run.The technological advancements and moves to strengthen ties with local business owners make Yelp a great buy.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) has been rising steadily over the last three months, gaining to the tune of 6.5% and beating the S&P 500. Yelp has seen rapid growth in its business, as the number of users and advertisers on its platform has continue to grow. For example, Yelp reported revenue of $76.4 million, up 66% year-over-year, in the first quarter.More importantly, Yelp's average monthly visitors grew 30% year-over-year to around 132 million, while average monthly mobile visitors grew 52% year-over-year to approximately 61 million. Active local business accounts grew 65% year-over-year to approximately 74,000.For the next quarter, analysts expect revenue ranging between $85 million and $86 million, a 55% year-over-year increase. Full-year revenue is expected to range between $363 million and $367 million, which will be a growth of 57% over 2013. A closer look at Yelp's business will make it clear why the company is reporting such solid growth and why the momentum should continue.Growing globallyYelp's acquisition of its European competitor, Qype, has enabled it to expand globally, especially in Europe. Yelp is trying hard to be the top local search engine across the world. While there is tremendous quarterly and yearly growth in the revenue, the expenses of the company are just growing just as fast, resulting in no profits and consecutive losses. But, the good news is that Yelp has seen a 130% increase in the number of reviews on its site in the past year, as compared to a 75% increase in reviews at Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).The company has grown its revenue at an annual average of 70% for the last three fiscal years, and analysts expect that it will keep on doing the same, with an annual average of 34.5% for the next three years. Even if it achieves this projection, it will have revenue of $1.39 billion by 2019, which will give it a forward price-to-sales ratio of 3.These strategies will drive growthThe company is currently focusing on three key themes that will play a considerable role in deciding its fate. Under the first theme, Yelp is aiming at technological advancements. With the growing use of smartphones and tablets, Yelp has introduced a number of new features and functions that will help contributors, consumers, and business owners. Yelp also introduced a feature that allows its users to post reviews based on their likes and dislikes. The company has increased its reviews by around 1 million under this theme.Under the second theme, Yelp is focusing on its expansion plans. The acquisition and integration of Qype in Germany led to a contribution of around 1.8 million reviews and approximately 1.4 million photos to Yelp.Lastly, Yelp aims to strengthen its ties with local business owners. Its Revenue Estimator function has helped businesses evaluate the leads they get from Yelp. It also helps consumers to discover the business and to place their orders. Also, Yelp's call to action feature has received great response, driving more than 40,000 customer leads per week to Yelp advertisers.One of the most interesting features that the company has added is SeatMe, which will allow its users to reserve tables at a restaurant, bar, or a lounge. Also, Yelp's balance sheet shows that the company is strong, has no debt, and has a strong cash position of almost $390 million.Analyst upgradesIn addition to Yelp's strong prospects, the recent upgrades from numerous research firms is also a reason to consider adding Yelp to your portfolio. Research firm Zacks recently upgraded Yelp from ""neutral"" to ""buy"" on mobile growth opportunities. Zacks stated:In addition, Northland Securities also upgraded Yelp to Outperform and raised its price target from $85 to $94.ConclusionHence, Yelp is growing at a terrific pace. The company's focus on product innovation and expansion will allow it to sustain its terrific rate of growth going forward. As such, investors should consider buying Yelp for the long run.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Yelp stock rose 14% on Friday and GrubHub shares gained 7% after Priceline agreed to pay a 47% premium on top of OpenTable's market capitalization. Yelp is the most widely predicted takeover target on the crowdsourced M&A predictions platform Mergerize.com, and last week's news has investors betting that an acquisition might be in the near future for Yelp as well.Yelp's stock hasn't performed particularly well in 2014 as the company was adversely affected by the rotation from high momentum growth names to more stable and larger companies. The swing was especially brutal between March and April when Yelp shares tumbled from a high of $101.75 to $54.68 for a loss of nearly 50%.(Click here for chart details)Although Yelp has struggled with profitability over the past two years and has failed to post positive earnings in any single quarter, the company's revenue has been increasing steadily. In March the broad sell-off targeted stocks with high (or negative) price to earnings ratios like Yelp, but consistent revenue growth and the promotion of its 2013 acquisition, SeatMe, leaves plenty of upside in play for Yelp.(Click here for chart details)SeatMe is an online and mobile reservation app designed to go toe to toe with OpenTable which currently dominates the market. Yelp offers similar user generated content (ratings and reviews) compared to OpenTable, but its SeatMe app its poised to become a much cheaper alternative for restaurants to fill available seats than OpenTable. On average OpenTable's combined monthly subscription and per reservation charges add up to a $697 monthly bill to restaurants using the service. Comparatively, SeatMe offers a similar service for only $99 per month, with no additional variable costs.For obvious reasons, SeatMe could quickly become a thorn in OpenTable's side if the platform can gain some traction among diners. The only potential roadblock here is the first mover advantage that OpenTable has. OpenTable already has table hunters on its platform which it offers to users for free. But it's not an impossible problem for Yelp to solve.Yelp has become one of the most well-known and trusted mobile and desktop apps for restaurant reviews. Many OpenTable users go on Yelp first to find which restaurant they would like to eat at before switching back over to OpenTable to book a reservation. Yelp is already dangling its reservation app on its review pages. With more promotion SeatMe may be able to cut OpenTable out of the reservation booking process completely and gain adoption from restaurants and users alike.(Click here for chart details)GrubHub recently had its IPO and unveiled fundamental financial information to investors. GrubHub, which merged with Seamless in 2013, offers online and mobile apps where customers can order and pay for online restaurant deliveries. Like Yelp and OpenTable, much of the value of GrubHub comes from its user generated ratings and reviews. The large premium that Priceline paid to acquire OpenTable is a sign that companies are placing a ton of value in community assets that generate their own content.GrubHub has its own restaurant ratings and reviews, but the company is still somewhat vulnerable to Yelp in a similar fashion to OpenTable. The advantage that GrubHub has over OpenTable is that its platform carries a lower risk of being copied. Reservation search and booking isn't too complicated of a process. There are only three variables involved - the name of the restaurant, party size, and the desired time of the reservation. The real differentiators for reservation booking apps are the quantity and quality of content, and the price point for restaurants, two areas where Yelp may have a leg up on OpenTable. On the other hand, building a platform where restaurants can create their own clickable and customizable online menus including a mobile payments system is a much more difficult undertaking, and that offers some hope of protection for GrubHub.Although GrubHub's revenue has more than doubled on a year over year basis in each of the previous two quarters, Yelp is the king of content and the food-tech company getting all the attention in the rumor mill. On Mergerize 14 predictions have been made that Yelp will be acquired within one year. The mostly commonly predicted acquirer is Yahoo (YHOO) with 7 analysts believing Yahoo will look to acquire Yelp after its windfall from the Alibaba IPO. The average predicted takeover price on Mergerize is $7.81B, and the news of the OpenTable deal just increased Yelp's market capitalization by more than $750M to $5.34B. If Yelp were to be acquired today for the same 47% premium that Priceline paid for OpenTable, the sale price would be around $7.85B. Maybe there is some wisdom in the crowd for M&A after all.Disclosure: None."
2327465,60151,2014-07-21T19:08:37-04:00,Yelp's business model is not conducive to improved profitability.The FTC investigation leveled against Yelp is a mounting concern.Yelp trades at an unbelievable 235 FORWARD price to earnings and a price to sales of 19.26.,"Yelp Inc. (NYSE:YELP) has had a volatile, yet ultimately prolific track record in the stock market since its IPO at $15 per share in March of 2012. The shares quickly soared and nearly eclipsed $100 a share in March of this year. Despite this tremendous run-up in its share price, Yelp remains unprofitable. With no earnings to show, Yelp is trading based on future prospects, which can prove to be a dangerous notion. Even after trading down to its current level of $68.35 a share, Yelp still remains grossly overvalued.About YelpYelp Inc. connects people with great local businesses. Its users have contributed a total of approximately 56.9 million cumulative reviews of almost every type of local business, from restaurants, boutiques and salons to dentists, mechanics and plumbers. Its platform provides local businesses with a range of free and paid services, which help them to engage with consumers at moment when they are deciding where to spend their money. The company generates revenue from local advertising, brand advertising and other services. Its products portfolio includes local business, national/brand advertisers and transaction partners.Recent PerformanceYelp remains categorized as being in the hyper-growth stage of its life cycle. In Q1 of 2014, Yelp recorded net revenue of $76.4 million, which is up an outstanding 66% y/y. Companies that are experiencing that level of top-line growth make investors sanguine about its future prospects. However, even with that remarkable revenue expansion, Yelp, nonetheless, remains unprofitable. With a deluge of competitors entering the space, it will prove difficult for Yelp to justify its current valuation.Analysis of ProfitabilityRevenue Break-downYelp generates revenue from three avenues. Local advertising is its main driver with 85% of revenue coming from there. Brand advertising is the next largest with 10% and 5% comes from various other initiatives such as gift certificates and a third party ad network.Source:10QSource:10QDeep Dive Into ExpensesOn the expense side, their cost of revenue is quite minimal as it only includes credit card processing fees, web hosting expenses, internet service costs, benefits and stock based compensation, and allocated facilities costs. This expense segment represented 7% of revenue and increased 52% y/y.Sales and marketing is by far the most substantial expense Yelp faces. This segment represented 59% of net revenue in the most recent quarter and increased 60% y/y. The reason for this expense structure is that community managers are responsible for building brand awareness and generating buzz once Yelp enters a new market. With 85% of revenue coming from local advertising, it is obvious why they rely so heavily on salesmen. This reliance will staunch their potential to become more profitable in the future.Another notable expense to discuss is product development. Y/Y this segment grew a significant amount, 93%, and comprises 18% of net revenue. Investing in its infrastructure is essential to providing users with the best possible interface. Management realized this and stated that they expect product development expenses to continue to climb in future quarters.The final expense category we will break-out is general and administrative. Y/Y this ballooned 50% as the company added more support staff. Management expects to expenses to grow considerably in this segment as well.Overall, even though Yelp grew revenue exceptionally, its business model is not conducive to scaling. Its reliance on a local sales force ensures that profitability will remain low. Further, Yelp's quarterly earnings reports were propped up by an income tax benefit of $2 million, but it still reported a loss in excess of $2.6 million.Management alluded to its difficult business model in the 10Q:Business ModelYelp investors are expecting profitability to improve dramatically. However, with the way Yelp derives its revenue, that is unlikely to materialize. Ad rates should remain constant or decline as competitors enter the market, its load capacity for ads is limited, internationally is it failing to catch on, and the FTC investigation is proof of a flaw in its system.So now that I have boldly claimed a flawed business model, I will move to substantiate my claims.First a quote from the 10Q that investors should consider:Local AdvertisingYelp provides both free and paid business listing products to businesses of all sizes. It enables businesses to create a free online business account. Then businesses can have the option of enhancing the listing which eliminates search advertising and incorporate a video clip on their page. Business also have the option of paying to promote themselves as a sponsored search result through a cost-per-click program.Source: Investor PresentationThe ad load that is possible with the ads for local businesses is quite limited. In a typical search for a business, a consumer will see one advertisement. In most cases, Yelp doesn't even earn revenue unless the ad is clicked on, so increased revenue generation through this avenue is dependent on the platform growing overall. Therefore, revenue expansion is tethered to the platform gaining users. With user growth decelerating as markets saturate, this does not bode well for Yelp.Source: Investor PresentationBusinesses DeterredThe number of businesses that believe the enhanced pages or ads are worth the cost is quite minimal compared to the overall number of businesses registered. On the entire platform, Yelp has 1.6 million businesses, but only 73,600 are active business accounts which represents roughly 4.6% of the total.Many businesses may be deterred from entering the platform as the policy of saving user anonymity makes user reviews unverifiable. A situation may arise where competing businesses write negative reviews for each other which will not be able to be removed. Maybe this is to blame for the miniscule percentage of paying businesses.Moreover, Yelp has a 1-9-90 business model in which 1% of users are dedicated reviewers, 9% are occasional reviewers and 90% only read the reviews. With such a high dependence on a concentrated segment of reviewers, a policy change removing anonymity could significantly reduce the number of reviews. Yelp is certainly in a catch-22.Further, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is actively investigating 2,045 complaints leveled against Yelp from 2008 to 2014. The integrity of the platform is certainly in question and if continued negative sentiment mounts, Yelp will face an incredibly difficult situation where businesses will flock from it.International PresenceOverall, Yelp has a presence in 120 cities. 61 are in the U.S., while 59 are international. Yelp seems relatively balanced until one looks closer into the revenue breakdown. In Q1 of 2014, international revenue accounted for a paltry 3% of total revenue. This is quite alarming when the business model is considered. Yelp has community managers attempting to spread the brand in new markets, but it is clearly failing internationally. Yelp is incurring the salaries of the managers, but is not reaping any reward. Its international strategy clearly is not working.CompetitionSince entering the industry, Yelp has faced mounting competition. Yelps main competitors are: OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN), Grub Hub (NYSE:GRUB), Trip Advisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), Foursquare, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).OpenTable had earnings of 33 million in 2013 with 30,000 restaurants in their database and sees an average of 15 million people book reservations on its platform each month. Recently, PriceLine (NASDAQ:PCLN) purchased OPEN for $2.6 billion. However, OPEN's platform is much more scalable and lucrative. Restaurants that have a subscription to the service have average charges of $697 per month. While Yelp's recent acquisition of SeatMe offers a similar service for $99 per month. However, OPEN has a first mover advantage in the industry. This acquisition created speculation that Yelp may be an acquisition target as well.Grub Hub allows users to place takeout and delivery orders at restaurants. The business model is slightly different from Yelp's in that it is focused on creating orders online.Foursquare helps users discover great places and boasts over 50 million users on its platform and 1.7 businesses that use the merchant platform.Facebook is on the fringes of entering this industry with its new graph search. Facebook has the largest presence of business pages, with 30 million active pages including 19 million on mobile. Users can review businesses just like on Yelp. Graph search will allow users to see friend recommendations and may enable FB to cannibalize Yelp's business.The competition between Yelp and Google has been apparent recently. In early July, Yelp filed a complaint against Google's search business. Yelp claims that Google is giving preference to its own service in search result lists. Google has been attempting to popularize its Google Places service which is a direct competitor to Yelp.Ad Prices Will Remain Stable Or FallThere are a number of competitors in the industry and Yelp's mere 132 million users will not be enough to sustain a competitive advantage. With a number of options for restaurants to advertise on, it will be unlikely for ad space to appreciate in value.Valuation LevelThe multiples that Yelp trades on are astonishing. Maybe Janet Yellen's insight will prove to be true.Source: NY TimesOn a forward price to earnings basis, Yelp trades at an incredible 235x. When juxtaposed with the profitable Facebook which has a current PE ratio of 80, the valuation of Yelp seems unbelievable, especially considering that their revenue growth rates were comparable. Further, on a price to sales basis Yelp trades at a lofty 19.26x. In order to justify those levels, Yelp would need to grow at an incredible pace.Looming CostsYelp's future profitability is further in question based on a few items in their 10Q.First, as of March 2014, the company had 546,607 restricted stock units with a weighted average grant price of $53.86 and 63,782 restricted stock awards with an average grant value of $9.45. The RSUs at this trading level would be roughly $8.2 million if executed, while the stock awards would cost the company around $3.8 million. It is easy for investors to not factor in these future expenses.Technology companies trade at higher PE multiples because most of their capex expenditures cannot be depreciated and amortized, so they flow right through and effect the bottom line directly. However, Yelp's recent acquisitions of SeatMe and Qype will hinder future quarters as well. SeatMe was acquired for $12.7 million in 2013 and Qype was acquired for $50 million in 2012. The company uses straight line depreciation so future quarters will be hurt by these expenses as well.Strong Insider SellingAlthough insiders may sell for numerous reasons, it is worth mentioning that insiders have been selling at a tremendous rate. Moreover the last insider purchase was in June of 2012 at $15.73 a share.Source: Open InsiderShare DilutionAnother factor for investors to consider is the severe dilution they have been subject to since Yelp first IPOed. Each year the share count has risen and this points to management believing that its shares are overvalued.Potential BuyoutAfter the purchase of OPEN by PriceLine, the speculation of Yelp being a buyout target has risen dramatically. Even though losses are mounting and the company has yet to determine an efficient operating model, the buyout risk is still evident. A company that believes it can leverage its platform and integrate it with their user base could present an offer.Moreover, Yahoo (NASDAQ:YHOO) will be getting a windfall once the Alibaba IPO happens in September. Although I do not believe Yelp will justify its valuation, a prudent investor should realize the buyout risk and be wary of outright shorting Yelp.Concluding RemarksInvestors are pricing in exceptional revenue growth coupled with profitability improvement for Yelp to come anywhere close to justifying its enormous valuation. However, with its business model, scalable growth is difficult to obtain. Moreover, with heightened competition, an FTC investigation, and hidden costs on the horizon, Yelp's future outlook is dismal. Investors should avoid this overly-hyped stock.Disclosure: The author is long FB. The author wrote this article themselves, and it expresses their own opinions.

Consistent revenue growth and persistent takeover speculation have kept Yelp in focus as one of the most talked about stocks on the market.On crowdsourced mergers and acquisitions platform, Mergerize.com, Yelp is the single most predicted takeover target with 22 predictions made. We have already seen plenty of merger and acquisition activity this year, especially in the biopharmaceuticals.It's believed that many of the food-tech platforms may be ripe for consolidation. There are tremendous economies of scale within the industry and the individual platforms tout millions of users each. As companies such as Yelp, GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB), and OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) onboard a critical infrastructure of restaurants and users, they become valuable strategic assets to other online advertisers. OpenTable was the first domino to fall back in June when the company was acquired by Priceline.com (PCLN) for a deal valued a $2.6 billion, a 46% premium to OpenTable's stock price at the time.The most common prediction about Yelp on Mergerize is that Yahoo (YHOO) may set its sights on the restaurant ratings and reviews website as soon as Alibaba has its IPO sometime after Labor Day. The average price predicted for Yahoo to acquire Yelp on Mergerize is $8.67 billion, a 57% premium on Yelp's current $4.93 billion market capitalization.When Alibaba finally does go public, Yahoo will be forced to sell a significant portion of its stake in the Chinese e-commerce behemoth. Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer has promised to return half the proceeds of the Alibaba stake to shareholders, the other half will remain as a bankroll for Yahoo to go shopping.Since joining Yahoo 2 years ago, Marissa Mayer has been pounding the table about her strategy of capturing daily user engagement on mobile devices. The shocking and terrific results from Facebook's mobile advertising business suggest that she might have the right idea. Yelp would be a tailored fit to Yahoo's portfolio of mobile brands and services that also aligns nicely with Mayer's strategy of daily mobile engagement. Yahoo already has an established mobile advertising business, and Yelp could provide Yahoo with a much needed opportunity for revenue growth.Estimize.com ranks and allows the sorting of analysts by accuracy. The analyst with the lowest error rate on Yelp is a consumer discretionary sector professional who goes by the username sana5000. Over 2 previously scored estimates on Yelp sana5000 has averaged an error rate of 10.6%. Estimize is completely open and free for anyone to contribute, and the base of contributing analysts on the platform includes hedge fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, non professional investors, and students.The Estimize consensus was more accurate than the Wall Street consensus 65% of the time last quarter on the coverage of nearly 1000 stocks. A combination of algorithms ensures that the data is not only clean and free from people attempting to game the system, but also weighs past performance and many other factors to gauge future accuracy.Contributing analysts on the Estimize.com platform are forecasting that on Wednesday Yelp will lose 2c per share fewer than Wall Street is predicting and beat the Street's revenue consensus by a gap of less than $1 million. The Estimize community is expecting Yelp to post year over year revenue growth of 58% while the 1c loss per share remains unchanged compared to the same period of last year.If Yelp's earnings remain in a perpetual holding pattern and the stock price fails to push higher, the company may be looked at as a strategic acquisition sometime later this year.Disclosure: NONE"
2589405,25791,2014-10-23T13:30:22-04:00,,"By Sindhu SubramaniamYelp (NYSE:YELP) just reported its preliminary financial results based on which we provide a unique corporate earnings release-based analysis of its performance. Our analysis focuses on the company's performance for the same quarterly period on a year-on-year basis (unless stated otherwise). HighlightsThe table below shows the preliminary results and recent trends for key metrics such as revenues and net income (see complete table at the end of this report):  Earnings Growth Analysis: The company's earnings growth has been influenced by the following factors: (1) Year-on-year improvements in gross margins from 93.01% to 93.97% and (2) better cost controls. As a result, operating margins (EBITDA margins) improved from 2.02% to 8.93% year-on-year. In addition, gross margins were 93.42% and EBITDA margins 8.07% in the immediate last quarter.  Gross Margin Trend: Companies sometimes trade off for improvements in revenues and margins by extending friendlier terms to customers and vendors. One quick way to check against such activity is to compare the changes in gross margins with any changes in working capital. If the gross margins improved without a worsening of working capital, it is quite possible that the company's performance is a result of truly delivering in the marketplace and not simply a prop up using the balance sheet.The company's improvement in gross margins have come at the expense of a deterioration in working capital management, suggesting that the improvements in gross margins are likely trade-offs with the balance sheet and not strictly from operating decisions. Its working capital days have gone up to 324.95 from last year's levels of 144.10 days.  Operating Cash Flow Growth Versus Earnings Growth: Companies often post earnings numbers that are influenced by non-cash activities. One way to gauge the quality of the declared earnings number is to judge the deviation in the growth in earnings from the growth in operating cash flows. In general, an earnings growth rate that is higher compared to the operating cash flow growth implies a higher proportion of non-operating and even one-time activities - such activities are typically not sustainable over long periods. YELP-US's year-on-year change in Operating Cash Flow of 172.38% trailed its change in earnings suggesting that the earnings number might have benefited from some unlocking of accruals. On a positive note, this change in Operating Cash Flow was better than the average among the declared results thus far in its peer group.  Unusual Items: The company's earnings growth also has been influenced by the following factors: (1) Improvements in EBIT margins from -2.58% to 4.44% and (2) unusual items. The company's pretax margins are now 4.63% compared to -2.96% for the same period last year.  EPS Growth Versus Earnings Growth: YELP-US's year-on-year change in Earnings per Share (EPS) of 225% is less than its change in earnings of 256.63%. This lower EPS growth suggests a likely larger dilution in the company's shares this period. Moreover, the change in earnings is less than the average among the declared results thus far in its peer group suggesting that the company is losing ground in generating profits in this group.

2269763,53422,2014-06-16T04:28:37-04:00,Surging IPO and mergers and acquisitions activity lulls investors into a dreamy state.Priceline's acquisition of OpenTable is adding to the current M&A and buyout frenzy with lofty valuations.Loss-bleeding Yelp to be the next OpenTable?,"Investors who follow the recent stock market news must feel taken back to the wild dotcom years when small, loss-making companies fetched multi-billion dollar valuations. Stock market indices still are close to their all-time Highs, the Dow Jones currently quotes at 16,731 and the S&P 500 at 1,933 and, equally astounding, IPO activity keeps on surging.Intelligize, a firm that provides analysts with financial data, recently commented on the IPO boom in the first quarter of 2014 and upbeat IPO momentum for the second quarter [emphasis added]:IPO activity is always a reflection of how businesses see the state of the capital markets. Investor optimism usually leads many companies to raise capital and tap the stock market. Rising IPO volumes, however, are always (I mean always) a sign of an advanced bull market.(Source: PricewaterhouseCoopers)As if that was not enough to convince the critically thinking investor about how far the current bull cycle has already progressed and that we are about to repeat past valuation mistakes, consider this excerpt about surging mergers and acquisitions activity from the same source, Intelligize:A recent Ernst & Young report confirms the uptick in mergers and acquisitions deals and the positive outlook for the M&A industry as well.Lofty valuations another tell-all signOne particular attention grabbing news headline last Friday relates to the acquisition of OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) by travel agent website Priceline (PCLN). Bloomberg summarized the deal terms in an article on June 14, 2014:After deal announcement, shares of OpenTable shot up more than 48% and closed at $104.48.From a financial perspective, I don't think the deal is attractive for Priceline. OpenTable reported full-year earnings of approximately $33 million in 2013 and its equity is now valued at $2.5 billion - after the acquisition offer. Even if investors considered an optimistic OpenTable earnings estimate of $45 million (implying a 35% y-o-y growth rate) for the current fiscal year, the deal would value the restaurant reservation company at 56 times estimated 2014 earnings. A massive premium.While OpenTable's shareholders certainly love the deal (and the 50% gain in a single day), investors were quickly looking around to see which other company could become a potential acquisition target. Yelp (NYSE:YELP), of course, was one of the beneficiaries of the Priceline/OpenTable deal with shares rising 14% on Friday. Justified? Hardly.Probably the biggest deterrence to a potential acquisition is that Yelp is still bleeding losses. Though Yelp's net revenues have increased by a factor of nine to $233 million since 2009, continued losses are not likely to improve Yelp's value proposition in the M&A marriage market. The overview below from Yelp's most recent 10-K filing with the SEC highlights the fairly unattractive earnings record of the business review enterprise as net revenues soared.(Source: Yelp 10-K filing)Yelp's market valuation is out of touch and prices the company for perfectionInvestors reacted extremely emotional to Priceline's acquisition offer for OpenTable, which, by the way, was profoundly endorsed by Wall Street, and investors quickly looked for other potential acquisition targets. However, I can hardly see how Yelp's already inflated market valuation will help the company attract a buyer.Yelp currently has a market capitalization of $5.4 billion and trades at approximately 250 times forward earnings and 19 times sales according to Morningstar. Truly stunning valuation metrics for a company that continues to post sequential losses and which can hardly be justified.(Source: Morningstar)Chart situationYelp shot up 14% in Friday's emotional trading session after Priceline's acquisition of OpenTable put investors into a collective state of euphoria.(Source: StockCharts.com)ConclusionI think the current excitement over the OpenTable acquisition has little significance for Yelp. While the company has been increasing its user base to over 132 million (a metric analysts focused on during the dotcom years as well), the company also continues to command a nose-bleed valuation and has a very unconvincing earnings record at the same time. Yelp is purely a speculative play that feeds off the current OpenTable speculation.Taking a step back and looking at the big picture, I want to summarize the three key points I made in this article to make sure the argument really sinks in: IPO activity is surging, mergers and acquisitions are booming and companies, especially in the 'new economy', are conducting acquisitions at mind blowing valuations.

2267913,41821,2014-06-13T12:36:50-04:00,"OpenTable was bought out in an all-cash deal with Priceline at a 46% premium to market, at a value that's 60 times its forward earnings.Yelp has recently ventured into this space after their acquisition of SeatMe.Investors are foolishly speculating that the same thing is going to happen to Yelp, pushing shares up nearly 10% today on what I believe are false hopes.","OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) is like the original gangster of table reservation and restaurant services. Formed in 1998 with over 600 employees at the end of 2013, the company has generated over $33 million in net income over the past full year through its real time reservation services. It currently works with about 30,000 restaurants in the United States.The niche for OpenTable's growth is a niche that is definitely continuing to move forward aggressively. As the entire world begins to move to digital, one of the items that's eventually going to be 100% digital is your restaurant and dining reservations. Much like the way most people buy their movie tickets now, reservations are much quicker made online than bothering to call up the business and speak to a host/hostess who may or may not be interested in helping you, depending on his/her age, how much he/she earns, and how hungover he/she might be from the previous nights' debauchery. If you've ever worked in the restaurant industry, you know exactly what I'm talking about.Priceline (PCLN) seemed to realize this, and quickly chomped up OpenTable in an all-cash deal, at a monster premium that shareholders are going to have no choice but love.Seeking Alpha was one of the first places to drop the news, early this morning:While the buyout was certainly at a pretty lofty valuation (sixty times forward earnings), Priceline obviously felt there was tons of intrinsic value for growth internally for OpenTable.On this news, investors have piled into Yelp (NYSE:YELP), which has recently tried to make its own foray into restaurant reservations and online services.Over the last two years, if you don't count today, Yelp has grown exponentially while OpenTable sort of waited in the wings for its heydey. The institutionally-backed Yelp started to scream after its IPO, despite not turning a profit, lack of redundancy and diversification, and competition from entities like Google reviews and TripAdvisor.Which brings us back to Yelp trying to move in the same direction as OpenTable. Remember Yelp's move into this area with their 2013 acquisition of SeatMe? This seems to be what is getting people excited about buying into Yelp on the OpenTable news today.Seeking Alpha reported on this during mid-May:I commended Yelp for this move in a previous article, citing the fact that it's likely everything goes digital. I advised not to buy Yelp, but that it was a step in the right direction to diversify a little and focus on something else aside from its money losing review business that's been made into a public company that transfers money from retail investors to the institutions that backed Yelp's IPO - along with Yelp insiders. I still think Yelp is due for it's first real post-IPO crash; and by that, I mean more than the 50% haircut it took earlier this year.It seems like it was just weeks ago that I was showing the following chart:...to make the point that Yelp may be doing something right in moving in the direction of OpenTable. OpenTable shareholders clearly felt so as well, as the stock had dipped 7% on the day of Yelp's announcement.People continue to be impressed with Yelp, despite the fact that it trades at a ridiculous multiple and continues to post losses, as I denoted in my May article that came out after Yelp's earnings:While M&A activity is definitely picking up nowadays (a sign of a good marketplace, according to Jim Cramer), the valuation that Priceline paid for OpenTable should not send people speculatively buying into Yelp stock in the hopes that the same thing will happen to Yelp.People seem to be agreeing with me, as well. As Yelp's price depressed, the shorts piled in. I'll be interested to see how the short interest looks in the coming weeks now that the stock has popped up yet again.YELP data by YChartsAs the short interest continues to rise, concurrent with how the price acts, Yelp's outstanding share count continues to grow; slowly diluting those that hold the company's shares.YELP Shares Outstanding data by YChartsYelp is a company that currently has only $5.57 in cash per share and a book value of only $6.99 per share. That puts the company's price to book ratio at a massive 9.42. Additionally, carrying a market cap of over $5 billion means that the company has a forward P/E of 235 - one of the highest of all of the speculative momentum stocks.Iraq fueled macro market uncertainty over the last couple of days would be one of the last reasons that I would be piling into a company like Yelp. When the market pulls back and sensibility and a conservative mindset start to take hold, companies like Yelp are always the first ones to get roped in on that news.While the OpenTable deal is a great success for OPEN's shareholders, don't try and ""chase"" and pile into a bloated and overvalued Yelp on the speculation of getting a piece of a deal that's already passed you by.Best of luck to all investors.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2234933,25381,2014-05-23T06:15:19-04:00,"Just because a stock fell sharply recently does not mean it is cheap.Yelp's business model of spending $50 million in marketing to generate $45 million in revenues is not sustainable.Even if all analyst goals are met, we are still looking at a ridiculous forward valuation.Revenue-wise the growth opportunities are limited for Yelp outside of the US.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is one of those companies that enjoy a ridiculous valuation even as many of the high-flyers in the market are going through corrections. While between the beginning of the year and now Yelp's price fell from almost $100 to nearly $50, the company is still ridiculously overvalued and even the most bullish projections don't justify the current price. This tells us that just because some stock fell by 50% doesn't mean it is undervalued.After growing its revenues by an annual average of 70% for the last three fiscal years, the analysts expect the company to grow its revenues by 57% this year, 41% next year and about 40% for the next three years. While these are very bullish projections, even these projections don't justify the current share price. Even if Yelp meets these ridiculously high projections, it will still have revenue of $1.39 billion by 2019 and this gives it a forward price-to-sales ratio of 3. Of course, we have to discount for the appreciation we expect in share price in addition to the ongoing dilution. If we discount 15% for share appreciations (which is fair because this is a high-beta stock and when people invest their money in a high-beta stock, they expect high volatility and higher-than-average returns for taking a risk) and 5% for the dilution we actually find out that Yelp's forward price-to-sales ratio is actually 9 even if it meets all the analyst goals.Also, keep in mind that Yelp's business model of ""spending $50 million on sales and marketing in order to generate $45 million in new revenues"" is not sustainable and will not result in profitability anytime soon. Even if the company meets all the analyst estimates for future revenues, it is still highly unlikely to become profitable since this is something Yelp has never achieved in its history. Every year, the company's revenue grows tremendously but the company's expenses grow just as rapidly (if not even at a faster rate), resulting in no profits.For example, four quarters ago, Yelp generated $55.02 million in revenues and booked $55.60 in operating expenses. In the following quarter, the company grew its revenues to $61.18 while the operating expenses grew to $62.96. The quarter after this one, Yelp's revenues grew to $70.65 million while the operating expenses rose to $72.56 million. In the last quarter, Yelp's revenues grew to $76.41 million while operating expenses rose to $81.01 million. The company's guidance for the full-year also calls for operating expenses rising as fast as revenues and we are looking for another year with no profits.The analysts are still very generous to this company as they expect it to report a profit in 2015. The analysts expect Yelp to generate a profit of 32 cents per share by the end of 2015. Keep in mind that there were several other instances when the analysts thought that Yelp was going to post a profit and they were wrong every single time.Even if we agree with the analyst estimates, we are looking for 32 cents per share in net earnings by the end of 2015 and a 40% growth for the next 3 years, after which, the growth will slow to about 20%. So, we are looking at profits of 45 cents per share in 2016, 63 cents per share in 2017, 88 cents per share in 2018, $1.05 per share in 2019 and $1.26 per share in 2020. Assuming no dilution and no share appreciation, we are still looking at a forward P/E of 47 by the year of 2020 even in the bullish scenarios of the analysts! If we assume a 15% discount and 5% dilution since the company continues to increase its diluted share count every quarter at a steady rate in order to pay its management generously, we are looking at a forward P/E of 138 even as late as 2020. This is as ridiculous as it gets. No growth company in the world is given a 100+ P/E that might or might not happen 6 years down the road.If the company were given a P/E of 20 by 2020 and it met all analyst targets, its current price would be about $9 per share as opposed to the current price of $60 (when we consider the discount factor for dilution and future price appreciations). In order for Yelp to deserve the current share price, it would have to earn $8.73 per share by 2020, which is far, far above the analyst estimates.Where will this growth even come from? Yelp is already established in all major cities in the US and the company won't get much business in small or medium-sized towns. After all, why would someone who lives in a small town look for a local restaurant online? There is really no big city in the US where Yelp is not already established and well-known. Apart from the US, the company can chase growth in Asia and Europe; however, it won't profit much from those growth figures. According to the company's latest quarterly report, each American viewer of the website or the app results in 11 times as much revenue as an international viewer. In other words, Yelp wants to double its revenues by expanding international markets, it will have to find 11 viewers for each American viewer to generate the same kind of money. If Yelp couldn't even make a profit in the American market, how will it make a profit in markets where advertisement revenue is a fraction of what it is in the US?Every time I hear bulls on Yelp talk about how cheap the company is, they always say ""Yelp has so much potential, it could be the next Google"" but we see absolutely no sign or evidence of this ever happening. Just because some people say it has a lot of potential doesn't make it so. Even the management of the company doesn't want to hold any shares and many shares are dumped in the market as soon as they are awarded to the executives. A lot of people also argue that Yelp will get acquired by Google or Yahoo but if the company had any hopes of getting acquired anytime soon, the management wouldn't be dumping shares to the market as if they are hot potatoes, right?No matter how you cut it or how you look at it, there is no way to justify Yelp's current valuation. Spending $50 million per quarter on sales and marketing to generate $45 million in revenues is not a sustainable business model in the long term; neither is selling overvalued shares in the market to raise cash every year. The analysts currently have a price target of $83 on Yelp but even they don't know how they came up with such valuation. Yelp is not much more than a typical pump-dump stock and we've seen a lot of these during the dot.com bubble of late 1990s.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

This doesn't come as a big surprise, as its recent first-quarter results will show us. However, Yelp shares are down almost 15% in 2014. But in my opinion, I think this is a good opportunity for investors who should consider buying Yelp, as its business is expected to grow rapidly going forward.Rapidly improving financialsYelp's recent results have also been quite strong, with revenue growing 66% year-over-year in the previous quarter. Also, for the ongoing quarter, Yelp's revenue is expected to be in the range of $85 million to $86 million, representing growth of approximately 55% compared to last year.Additionally, Yelp is looking to improve its profitability. Its adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was approximately $8.5 million, a solid improvement from $3.2 million last year. For the second quarter, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $11.5 million to $12.5 million. Hence, it is clear that Yelp is growing at a good pace, and a look at the company's moves will reveal why its terrific performance is expected to continue going forward.The business is gaining tractionYelp is seeing some great growth in its key metrics. Cumulative reviews for the company that connects consumers with local businesses grew 46% year-over-year to approximately 57 million in the previous quarter. Average monthly unique visitors grew 30% year-over-year to approximately 132 million, and average monthly mobile unique visitors grew 52% year-over-year to approximately 61 million. Active local business accounts grew 65% year-over-year to approximately 74,000.To improve the experience that Yelp offers, it announced its integration into Yahoo (YHOO) local search, building on its existing partnerships with Apple Maps and Bing. In addition, it has integrations with several car navigation systems. Yelp has also entered into an advertising partnership with YP.com, which will enable it to introduce Yelp to an even broader pool of business owners. For the rest of the year, it targets to continue to support and engage its community of Yelpers, expand geographically, and create innovative products.Yelp's mission is to connect consumers with local businesses. Its goal is to be wherever consumers are looking for a local business, no matter where they are in the world or how they access its content. Yelp has been successful in its mission so far, as evidenced by the 132 million unique visitors who visited Yelp on a monthly average basis in Q1.More improvements in the cardsTo enhance the experience, Yelp is also rolling out new features to enhance the experience for its community of contributors and readers. It has been working to improve the mobile web experience. In Q1, it launched the ability to add photos via mobile web. The investment it has made over the past year has resulted in the strong engagement that it's experiencing across mobile. Approximately 35% of new reviews came from mobile, and about 60% of all searches came from mobile in the quarter.Yelp has also revamped its business listing page by increasing the number and size of photos, along with improving review highlights to emphasize the information that consumers find most useful. Also, Yelp's international communities are also experiencing increased traction and brand awareness. In Germany alone, the number of contributors has increased over 350% since it completed the Qype integration in October 2013.It continues to provide new ways to provide local businesses with more value. Recently, Yelp integrated its latest Yelp platform partner, Booker, allowing consumers to book spa and salon appointments directly on Yelp. It looks forward to integrating additional platform partners throughout 2014.Yelp is also experiencing good traction with the products it rolled out last year. Call to Action (CTA) is a popular feature with both advertisers and consumers, which is generating approximately 100,000 leads for advertisers every week. Further, the Customer Activity Feed, which it launched in Q4 of last year, provides business centers with details of each lead.ConclusionGiven the fast-growing nature of Yelp's business, it is not surprising to see that it trades at an expensive forward P/E ratio of 179. However, the company has a solid balance sheet with no debt. Its cash position is also quite strong, at $400 million. Moreover, according to Yahoo Finance, Yelp's earnings are expected to grow at a CAGR of 86% for the next five years, making it a solid growth pick.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

A Merchant Warehouse infographic released last year revealed that 72% of consumers trusted online reviews for their decisions. The study found that 90% of the visitors to online review site Yelp (NYSE:YELP) were influenced by the reviews they found on the site. Another research by BCG reported that businesses who made use of their Yelp accounts saw an average increase of $8,000 in annual revenues.Yelp’s FinancialsYelp’s first quarter revenues grew 66% over the year to $76.4 million, ahead of the market’s expectations of $75 million.

Other revenues improved 56% to $3.8 million. International revenues accounted for 3% of the quarter’s revenues.Despite rising revenues, Yelp’s profits are evasive. Yelp’s continuously rising sales and marketing and product development expenses eat into their margins. Sequentially, Yelp’s revenues grew a modest 8%, but over the same period, sales and marketing expenses grew 16% to $45.12 million and product development expenses increased 18% to $13.98 million.Among operating metrics, cumulative reviews grew 44% over the year to 57 million.

Further, they are also working with mapping service providers and Apple Maps to integrate local search that can be integrated with several car navigation systems.Earlier this week, they released a free reservation system to compete directly with online dining reservation services provider, OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN). Released under the name Yelp Reservations, the service will let restaurants in the US, Canada, Ireland, and UK take reservations from the portal for free, as long as they maintain a Yelp profile page. Last year, Yelp had acquired reservation service provider SeatMe and this new service leverages that acquisition. The move is an attempt to compete directly with players like OpenTable who charge a reservation fee from the restaurants when reservations are made through their site. Yelp is hopeful that restaurant owners will not only keep their profiles updated to ensure more accurate information on the restaurant’s page, but also end up buying into Yelp’s additional paid for services.Recently, Yelp also announced growth in the Latin American region with the launch of Yelp Argentina. Yelp released the web portal along with free iPhone and Android applications and their suite of business owner tools in the country. Argentina is the 27th country in which Yelp has expanded their operations. During the quarter, Yelp also began operations in Mexico and Japan.Their stock is trading at $55.53 with a market capitalization of $3.98 billion. It touched a high of $101.75 in March this year.Yelp vs. OpenTableYelp’s recent addition of the reservation system is an all out battle with reservation services provider OpenTable. OpenTable, which charges restaurants a fee for all reservations made through their system, saw revenues grow 18% this year to $53.8 million this quarter, in line with the market estimate. EPS for the quarter came in at $0.31 compared with the Street’s expectations of $0.30.By segment, reservation revenues grew 27% over the year and brought in 64% of the quarter’s revenues and subscription revenues grew 13% over the year. International expansion is also growing strong as OpenTable recently crossed the milestone of 40 million reservations in the international markets and 3 million restaurant reviews for these regions. International revenues grew 29% over the year to $7.8 million and revenues from North America grew 17% to $46 million.For the current quarter, OpenTable expects revenues of $54.7 million-$56.3 million with an EPS of $0.43-$0.48. The Street was looking for an EPS of $0.35 for the quarter. OpenTable expects to end the year with revenues of $221.9 million-$228.1 million and an EPS of $1.81-$1.96. The market was projecting an EPS of $1.36 for the year.During the latest quarter, OpenTable expanded their offerings to include mobile payment services. Launched as a pilot in the San Francisco market, OpenTable was pleased with the market’s response to the service. They plan to release this service in additional markets in the coming quarters.OpenTable’s stock is trading at $64.00 with a market capitalization of $1.51 billion. It touched a high of $87.48 in June last year.But, while OpenTable keeps adding restaurants and services like mobile payments to their menu, I think Yelp will be able to deliver a better model to their customers. By signing up with Yelp’s profile page, business owners will be able to avoid the costly reservation fees that is attributable to OpenTable while continuing to attract traffic driven by the reviews on Yelp’s site. Yelp Reservations is more focused on the truly local and smaller restaurants. In exchange, Yelp will benefit from added focus that the merchants will place on the information on their profile page. Meanwhile, Yelp’s recent tie-ups will get them more easily on the Map and on results from search engines."
2216773,41821,2014-05-14T07:04:21-04:00,"Yelp still trades at a massive forward multiple, and its stock has been clipped almost 50% over the last 3 months.Yelp's introduction of an OpenTable-like service that's less robust but far cheaper will likely boost restaurant engagement.I remain neutral on the company, as I'm not sold on this service's ability to sell more advertising - yet.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) has been a stock that I haven't ever bought into. I understand how the company operates, how it monetizes, and who stood to benefit from the company's institutionally-driven run-up to near $100 recently. Unfortunately, in a situation like that, you're always going to wind up having bag holders. And, those that bought in around the beginning of March are currently holding the bag.For the short term, Yelp has been decimated almost 50% since its highs in the beginning of March. The company pulled back after posting guidance that didn't meet the market's lofty expectation for the company last quarter. Days later, a slew of upgrades came in, which pulled Yelp up from $50 to around $55, where it sits today.From a long-term perspective, and as I've argued before, I continue to think that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) reviews could potentially give Yelp its walking papers. At the least, it's going to, at some point, rope in the enthusiasm behind Yelp, which trades at a forward P/E of 194. I just don't think Google will let Yelp grow as aggressively as it needs to support its multiple.My long-term contention was based on the fact that Yelp was simply a restaurant and business review website. Trading at such an aggressive multiple, you'd expect the company to be dipping its bucket into other wells.Well, yesterday, I finally heard some news about Yelp that I enjoyed - the company was getting ready to launch its own service to compete with OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN).Seeking Alpha reported:OpenTable closed down about 7% yesterday on the news, and rightfully so. Much of OpenTable's success has been attributed to it being the only operator in its particular space. Low-cost competition from Yelp could hurt OpenTable more than it could help Yelp - at first, at least.OPEN data by YChartsWhether or not this move is single-handedly enough to warrant Yelp's massive valuation still remains to be seen. Yelp is going to need to implement the service - which it's offering for cheap - which is likely going to require some initial capex. Further, once implemented, the company is going to have to find a direct route to monetize it - the price at which Yelp is offering the service means that it's likely going to need a good portion of market share before benefiting from it.I think this will definitely do well to boost engagement between Yelp and restaurants - a direct line to more advertising revenue remains to be seen.While I like this news, I'm again wary on Yelp as a long-term investment. I remain neutral on the company for the same reasons I've been neutral on it over the past month:While I remain cautious at this stage, my focus will continue to be with the company and how it, exactly, plans to monetize its new seating/reservation service.Best of luck to all investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2180673,25381,2014-05-01T04:53:45-04:00,"Yelp's quarterly results beat the analyst estimates by a little bit but the results were nothing to write home about.The company's growth rate continues to slow down, dilution continues to increase and monetization of content is very poor.The company's future guidance calls for further slow down in growth, more dilution and lack of profitability.At the current valuation, the company is still too expensive and it is mostly a speculation.","On Wednesday in the after-hours, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) announced its results for the quarter. While the company slightly beat the estimates, it still failed to post a profit, and to make matters worse, it offered guidance for the full-year that calls for a loss.Yelp posted a loss of 4 cents per share while the analysts were looking for a loss of 6 cents per share. Furthermore, the company generated $76.4 million in revenues, up 65.6% from the same quarter of last year. The analysts were looking for revenues of $75.1 million.Yelp conveniently reports only year-to-year growth rates which makes the results look better than they are and hides the slowing quarter-to-quarter growth. It's difficult to talk about seasonality in Yelp's business, so looking at quarter-to-quarter growth is as essential as looking at year-to-year growth.Last quarter, Yelp generated $70.65 million in revenues and 3 cents per share in net loss. Compared to the last quarter, Yelp's revenues grew by 8.14% which is nothing to write home about for a company that trades for such a high valuation. Don't get me wrong, Yelp's growth rate is impressive; however, this is more than baked in the company's share price. When Benjamin Graham was asked about whether a particular stock was a good buy or not, he asked them ""at what price?"" There are rarely bad stocks or good stocks, rather, there are stocks where the current valuation is cheap or expensive. Yelp is one of those stocks where the valuation continues to be expensive despite a sharp correction in the recent weeks.Last quarter, Yelp spent $38.85 million in sales and marketing which rose to $45.12 million this quarter, representing an increase of 16.13%. This means that Yelp's sales and marketing expenses grew twice as fast as its revenues did since the last quarter (roughly 16% vs. 8%). Product development costs rose from $11.80 million to $13.98 million while General and Administrative costs fell from $13.46 million to $13.17 million. All in all, Yelp posted a loss of $4.60 million from its operations, up from $1.91 million in the last quarter.Meanwhile, Yelp's share count continues to rise sharply. As of last quarter, the company's average diluted share count was 71.17 million, up from 68.86 million in the last quarter. As the company's share count grew by 3.35% between the last quarter and this quarter, this did not benefit the shareholders at all as all of the money went to executive stock options.When we look at Yelp's balance sheet, we see that cash reserves grew from $389 million to $399 million and total assets rose from $516 million to $533 million. As a result, the company's book value rose from $486 million to $500 million. While this is a move in the right direction, this looks like a rounding error compared to Yelp's market value of $4.15 billion.Yelp reported cumulative reviews of 57 million (up 46% from last year) and average monthly unique visitors of 132 million (up 30% from last year). For the quarter, Yelp attracted about 396 million visitors which translated into $76.4 million in revenues. This tells us a lot about Yelp's monetizing ability as the company effectively generated 19 cents of revenue per each visitor. At this rate, Yelp's profitability is in serious question.Here is the worst part though, for the second quarter of 2014, Yelp expects to generate $85-86 million in revenues and for the full-year of 2014, the company expects to generate $363-367 million. For the second quarter, we are looking at a quarter-to-quarter revenue growth of 11.25%, and for the full-year, we are looking at a year-to-year growth rate of 57%. In 2013, the average quarter-to-quarter revenue growth rate was 14.51% and the year-to-year revenue growth rate was 69%. Obviously Yelp's growth rate is slowing down both quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year basis.More importantly, Yelp will continue to lack profitability at least until 2015, if not beyond. For the full-year of 2014, Yelp expects its ""Adjusted EBITDA"" to be $56 to $60 million. This adjusted figure excludes $43 to $45 million in stock-based compensation. The company expects another $18-19 million in depreciation and amortization costs, which would move the company in the red zone. In other words, Yelp's management just guided for another year of loss as well as slowing growth.Yelp has very high stock-based compensation figures because the company rewards its management pretty generously. Of course, this keeps increasing the dilution each quarter and the company's investors are being punished for that. For example, in the same quarter of last year Yelp generated $0.73 per share in revenues compared to this quarter's $1.07 per share. The year-to-year revenue growth rate falls from 66% to 47% when we look at per-share basis because the company has a lot more shares in the market than it did last year, and by next year, it will have a lot more shares than it does right now. So, not only do we see a slowdown in the company's revenue growth, we are also looking at increased dilution, which will act as another speed bump for the company in per-share basis financials.Last year, when Yelp was in 60s and 70s, I kept talking about how the company was overvalued. When the share price kept climbing, some reader told me that ""I should admit being wrong and move on."" A few months later, Yelp's share price fell sharply and the company is still undervalued. The growth is slowing, profitability is nowhere to be found, dilution is ever-increasing and competition (Google, Facebook) is catching on. Also, Yelp's current monetization of 19 cents per viewer (per quarter) is very weak and Yelp continues to increase its revenues by increasing its marketing expenses rapidly. At this point, Yelp is a speculation rather than an investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2202743,22148,2014-05-08T12:44:30-04:00,"International expansion provides growth catalyst.
        Cohorts nearing 10-years old are still growing in the 60% range.
        The stock is approaching cheap valuations based on growth prospects.","The incredible part of the Yelp (NYSE:YELP) story is the consumer review site is only getting started internationally. During April, the company entered the 26th country in the form of Japan, but it only obtains roughly 3% of revenue from those international locations.The stock has been absolutely crushed with investors abandoning the hot social media stocks of 2013. At these moments, its good for investors to distinguish between a company and a stock. Yelp the company reported fantastic results for Q114 and provided more solid guidance for the rest of the year. In addition, the company did a fantastic job of portraying a thriving business with tons of growth catalysts for the future. Yelp the stock was priced for perfection back at the start of March when it hit over $100 and traded at valuations approaching 20x forward revenues.Now the valuation is down to a more respectable 7x forward revenues and within a level that will make an attractive investment, but lets review some of the metrics to see how we get to that determination.First quarter resultsAs mentioned above, the company generated solid results suggesting further strong growth. Investors looking for positive earnings were no doubt disappointed, but it doesn't add up that they were invested in Yelp in the first place.Yelp provided the following highlights for the quarter:Again, all of these metrics highlight an incredibly run company. Naturally, the concern that is causing investors to dump the stock is the reported loss of $(2.6) million, or $(.04) per share. Oddly, numbers that were better than expected and initially sent the stock higher, but the market did an about face and decided to crush the stock after the initial run up following earnings.Growth CatalystsYelp has plenty of growth catalysts with international expansion being a prime focus. International revenue only hit $2.5 million during the first quarter, but other growth opportunities exist within the U.S. based solidly on signing up more and more users and business accounts.The company estimates that roughly 25 million small businesses exist in both the U.S. and Europe. With only 74,000 active business accounts, Yelp has a long runway for adding business accounts. Only obtaining 10% of the business accounts in both the U.S. and Europe would cause the active accounts to explode to 5 million from only 74,000 today.Other opportunities exist for growing the engagement within the site. The company recently starting partnering with Booker to allow spa appointments to be booked directly from the site. In addition, the integration of SeatMe that the company purchased last year provides for plenty of growth in the area of reserving a table at a restaurant.Cohort AnalysisInvestors not understanding the growth potential of the concept and the reason for ongoing losses needs to look no further than the cohort analysis from the earnings slides.Though the slide lacks the cost aspects, one can quickly make a reasonable guess that the more established cohorts have solid margins. In addition, the huge growth by the cohorts that are going on 10 years old showcase the potential for the company.This slide highlights the growth potential of international expansion and why the company isn't showing profits. With the entry into Japan and Mexico, the company is spending money to support the site and build up a user presence, yet the revenue will lag for a few years. Yelp could easily stop expanding markets and quickly generate a profit off the original cohorts of San Francisco and New York, but it wouldn't provide that long-term growth opportunity.Stock ValuationThe stock valuation is more compelling now that its lost nearly 50% of its March value. The key to understanding the value proposition is that Yelp will quickly grow into about any metric used by investors. The stock trades at an enterprise value multiple of forward revenues of around 6x. This might appear expensive to investors, but even Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) with a market value of nearly $350 billion and a growth rate of around 20% trades at an enterprise value of nearly 5x forward revenues.YELP EV to Revenues (Forward 1y) data by YChartsConclusionYelp provides a good example of the extremes of the market. Investors need to focus back on the company and realize that it provides an excellent investment in the global consumer review business. It is a must own stock whether one thinks the stock is still going lower or it has already hit bottom. Analysts expect near 60% revenue growth for the year and profits near breakeven. The stock could go lower, but with that type of growth the company will quickly grow into the existing stock price and surpass it.The company has too many growth catalysts including international expansion and new tools for the domestic website to remain at the current valuation for much longer. With Yelp just getting started, investors shouldn't be selling now. Disclosure: I am long YELP. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

There is no doubt in my mind its run-up to nearly $100 was institutionally-driven, and the company has caused me to guess and re-guess what's going on under the surface when it violently whips upwards without news or fundamentals to drive it.It certainly is a curious case, Yelp.It's not one that I can seem to get behind either, even with the earnings that the company posted this week. Some of the chatter on the TV yesterday was with regards to Yelp's recent earnings, and how the stock price was reacting accordingly. Cramer went so far as to say that Yelp was the sole momentum stock to buck the trend - I'd agree, if I didn't remember how Yelp has traded since the beginning of March.Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Yelp continues to post losses and even offered full-year guidance that results in a loss. Like Pandora's (NYSE:P) audience metrics, Yelp has mastered the art of YOY comps to hide what metrics have been doing in the quarterly-to-quarter perspective.Yelp posted Q1 EPS of ($0.04), a beat by 2 cents, and revenues of $76.4 million, a beat of $1.34 million. The company guided for Q2 revenues of $85 million to $86 million, in line with estimates.After earnings, Seeking Alpha reported on a slew of upgrades that the company received:The stock, after pulling back post-earnings, jolted on the news of the upgrades. Heading into earnings, investors were expecting volatility. The Wall Street Journal reported:The funny thing is that while analysts and TV personalities continue to say that Yelp has bucked the trend of the momentum stocks, they seem to be forgetting about Yelp's performance over the last two months.Simply look at how the company has fared from early March to recent:Yuck! That's nearly a 50% haircut.From a long-term perspective, and as I've argued before, I continue to think that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) reviews is going to give Yelp its walking papers. At the least, it's going to curb the enthusiasm behind Yelp, which trades at a forward P/E of 194.I just don't think Google will let Yelp grow as aggressively as it needs to support its multiple.Yet, part of the long case continues to be that a company like Google could eventually make a bid for Yelp - but the question would be, why? With Google Reviews already in place and already the first thing that a potential user sees when Googling places like restaurants, why wouldn't Google just capitalize on the infrastructure it already has in place?While Google continues to gain traction with reviews, Yelp continues to post losses and, if you look, Yelp's issued and outstanding shares continue to grow.YELP Shares Outstanding data by YChartsThis isn't a position where I feel like it's a good opportunity to jump into Yelp for a long investment. Conversely, I'm not ready to short it either. Post-earnings, I'm neutral on Yelp due to:While the euphoria of the stock price movement upwards is likely being cast over investors in the company (unless they bought from $60 up to $100), I contend that it isn't time to Yelp for joy just yet.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2171233,40781,2014-04-29T04:46:31-04:00,"Yelp has beaten the top line for seven consecutive quarters.Look for Yelp's bottom line to come in-line with estimates.Is Yelp a Buy, Sell or Hold after earnings?","Yelp Inc. (NYSE:YELP), a company that connects consumers with great local businesses, will report its first-quarter earnings results on Wednesday, April 30, 2014, after the close of the U.S markets.Following the results, a conference call will take place at 4:30 p.m. ET / 1:30 p.m. PT. The live webcast, financial tables and slide presentation can be accessed through Yelp's investor relations website at www.yelp-ir.com.To access the call, investors need to dial 1 (800) 708-4539, or outside the U.S. 1 (847) 619-6396, with the Passcode number 37094125. An audio replay will be available after the call by dialing 1 (888) 843-7419 or 1 (630) 652-3042, with the Passcode number 37094125. The replay will also be available on the Company's website.Wall Street Expects:Earnings season is always filled with some tension, anxiety and nervousness from investors. Most of them have great reasons to feel this way as news can send shares either soaring or pouring.This is why investors should position themselves into the best possible situations. Looking at a company's past performances can shed quite a bit of light of what one can expect in the upcoming quarters. So how has Yelp fared with its past results? The table below shows Yelp's top-line results over the last couple of quarters.As we can see, Yelp has posted a nice streak of top-line beats. Not only that, but the gap is continuing to widen with each report. Of course this doesn't mean the Company will automatically beat expectations for the upcoming quarter, but it does show that management has delivered before and that history is certainly on the side of the longs.On top of that, Yelp hasn't missed on the top line since going public back in 2012. With another beat, Yelp can extend that streak to eight.Looking at the chart on the right, we can see that Yelp continues to impress on the top-line as revenues continue to grow at double digit rates.In 2014 alone, Yelp is expected to grow revenues by 55%. There doesn't seem to be a big drop-off either as analysts are projecting revenues to grow between 40%-45% in 2015.Monthly Active VisitorsNo matter what company you follow, there are always a couple of key metrics that will stand out. For example, investors in Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) like to look at the subscription numbers, while investors in Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) like to look at ""paid clicks"" etc. Yelp, certainly isn't any different. One metric that I like to keep an eye on is the number of monthly active unique visitors.As long as this number continues to increase at a steady rate quarter-over-quarter, I don't see why the Company won't be able to continue to beat expectations year after year. Based on my projections, the number of monthly active unique visitors will most likely come in around 124-125 million this quarter.ConclusionIn the last three months, Yelp's stock price, after climbing over $100, has fallen all the way down to $55.55 at the close of trading on Monday. So, either this is a wonderful buying opportunity right now, or shares were so out of whack in the first place that today's levels represent normal levels. So which one is it?As you probably already know by now, this question depends on your investment timeline. If you are more of a short term investor, then I would most likely stay away from Yelp. The charts as well as the market conditions are nothing to cheer about. However, if I happened to be more of a long term investor, I would be getting ready to either start a position, or adding on any near term dips.Looking at the chart above, it looks like Yelp is on its way to testing support around the $50-$51 level. If shares continue to fall, then the next area of support would be in the low $40's. Hypothetically speaking though, if shares were to touch these levels (low $40's), then shares would officially fall into the screaming BUY category in my book.Of Wall Street recommendations, the average opinion on Yelp is a BUY, with an average price target of $88.00. This represents upside of close to 60% from Monday's closing prices.As always, I'm providing you with my track record and other particular stocks that I recommend. The link provided will show you all of my picks, how they have fared, and where I think they will be going in the near future. I think you will find my track record to be very impressive and useful.Disclaimer: Investors are always reminded that before making any investment, you should do your own proper diligence on any stock mentioned in this article.

2171333,44981,2014-04-29T06:13:57-04:00,The recent fall in the stock price has made Yelp an attractively priced stock.There is a lot of room for the company to grow its revenues and the growth is unlikely to slow in the short-medium term.The company might face some negative publicity after some businesses accused Yelp of punishing them for not advertising with the company.,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is one of the fastest growing technology companies. It helps people find local businesses and leave reviews about different businesses. Despite a fall of over 43% since the start of March; the stock is still up over 100% during the last twelve months. The company mainly generates revenue through the sales of ads on the website, and there have been some allegations recently about the practices of the company - some business owners have accused Yelp of changing reviews if they do not decide to advertise with the website. Nonetheless, the recent fall has made the stock attractively priced and it might be a good time to take a position in this stock.Fundamentals and the Stock PriceYelp will report its first-quarter earnings on April 30 - the revenue growth for the company is expected to remain strong due to the expansion. At the end of the last quarter, Yelp reported a loss of $2.1 million; however, the stock still gained 20% after the earnings. The results of the company were in line with the analyst expectations. For a number of growing companies, the investors usually look at the revenue growth as it shows the company's ability to exploit the growth opportunity, and if the company can continue revenue growth in the short term then the investors sometimes ignore the profitability as the belief is that the profitability will eventually come as the expansion costs come down. Average annual revenue growth for the company has been over 60% during the last three years. However, the rise in the stock price has been a lot higher than the growth in revenues.Yelp's price-to-sales ratio is 15.2x while the industry's average is 6.5x. The company reported a net loss; as a result, the price-to-earnings ratio is meaningless at the moment. It is usually normal for the rapidly growing technology companies to have high price multiples. However, as the companies slowly enter the maturity in their life cycles, the price multiples come in line with the industry averages. The company is spending all the money for expansion at the moment. The company generated $21 million in operating cash flows last year, which was equal to the CapEx for the same period. The fundamentals of the business will improve; however, the price multiples are expected to remain higher than the industry averages in the short-medium term.Long-term prospectsOne of the most important metrics for the internet businesses is the active user base - Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) has achieved massive growth on the back of rising daily active users. However, the user bases for these companies are slowing as these companies already have massive user bases and there is little room to grow. However, Yelp's current user base is around 120 million, and there is a lot of room for the company to grow its following.The company has recently expanded in Latin America launching in Mexico. Previously, it broke ground in Asia with its launch in Japan, a major hub of both small and large businesses. Yelp now has operations in 26 different countries and is rapidly expanding its network.We believe that this growing global presence will allow the company to achieve substantial growth. The company has shown massive increase in its reviews reaching 53 million in the previous year, representing a robust increase of 43%. The new markets will allow the company to take these growth rates even higher.Advantage in the Mobile SegmentYelp's advantage is the social media aspect of its business. Among its 120 million users, 53 million are mobile users. In the previous quarter, 47% of the company's total ad revenue came from mobile devices, which means approximately half of its business is well positioned to generate greater revenues from the growing mobile segment across the globe. This aspect of the business will allow the company to not only grow its user base, but also increase its revenues. The increasing revenues would allow the company to cover its fixed costs and start generating the long-awaited profits in the coming years.Revenue Growth will ContinueYelp presently has more than 1.5 million businesses in its constantly growing global platform and the ratio of paying business accounts to non-paying grew by 69% to 67,200, compared to the same period last year. The growth in the new business accounted for around 4.5%, and we expect this rate to grow further in the coming years. As a result of SEC allowing the businesses and advisors to use third-party social-media endorsements, there might be a larger number of businesses willing to join the website. Increased participation by business will result in increased revenue for the company.Furthermore, Yelp has recently made a deal with YP, a local ad platform. YP links businesses and consumers through several mediums including mobile, online and print. We see this strategic move of Yelp to be very beneficial in medium-long term. This is because YP is the leader of local market with its reach to 90% of the US population.ConclusionThe earnings announcement for the first quarter is not far and if the company is able to meet the expectations; we might see another big rise in the stock price. In the long term, the prospects of the business remain bright as there is a lot of room for the company to grow. We believe the recent fall in the stock price has made it attractively priced.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2256943,62863,2014-06-06T16:25:20-04:00,"There is a major disconnect between management’s rosy assessment of its total addressable market (TAM) and Yelp’s customer capture rate.Yelp has a presence in 120 cities, of which, 59 are international, yet in Q1 FY2014, revenue from international cities accounted for only 3% of revenue.The FTC is investigating Yelp regarding the 2,045 complaints it received between 2008 and early 2014.$928 million in insider selling for a company with market capitalization of $4.6 billion would make Grover Norquist blush.","IntroductionThe objective of this write up is to qualitatively supplement the collective body of research contributed by Seeking Alpha community. At a high level, my aim is to explain to the readers what Yelp (NYSE:YELP) does and how it generates its revenue. I'm going to refrain from overly emphasizing Yelp's optimistic valuation relative to its FY2014 revenues as other SA authors have written many articles on this topic. However, I do want to point out that with a current enterprise value of approximately $4.28 billion (72 million diluted shares x $65 per share (June 5th 2014 closing price) less its $400 million in cash), it's trading at 11.72 times FY2014 forecasted revenue. It's really hard to make money on the long side paying this type of EV/Sales, especially adjusting for the fact that Yelp has a high absolute enterprise value. Moreover, notwithstanding biotech stocks, which rationally can sport aggressive EV/Sales ratios because the market is betting on its future blockbuster pipeline of molecules, online advertising doesn't have the same optionality upside, unless a company is starting from a very low base.What Yelp does and how it generates revenue:Essentially Yelp's goal and mission statement is to connect consumers with great local businesses. As of Q1 2014, Yelp operates in 120 cities. When Yelp enters a city or a defined geography, it hires a community marketing manager that's essentially the key brand ambassador for that territory. This person is tasked with spreading the Yelp gospel and proselytizing patrons in the city to join the Yelp community. Said differently, they must build brand awareness and generate buzz through creativity activities such as hosting events and marketing campaigns.If all goes according to plan, brand ambassadors create a virtuous feedback loop of establishing and growing a community. This community then writes online reviews and hopefully creates valuable content by sharing their interactions and experiences with local businesses. This usually leads to an increase in web and mobile unique monthly visitors. The larger an audience, especially an engaged audience, the greater propensity there is for Yelp's telesales team to convert unpaid businesses to Yelp advertising customers. Yelp's Vice President of Corporate Communication, Vince Sollitto, discussed the 1-9-90 rules on its Cantor Fitzgerald Q4 2013 presentation. This rule means that within a community, 1% of users are dedicated to the community and frequently share their experiences with local businesses by publishing their opinions of a business and rating their experience 1 out of 5 stars. The 9% are occasionally contributors that write an online review when they have a really good or bad experience. Lastly, there is the 90% of the community that only reads online reviews and uses the site for informational purposes.In terms of the economics of the business model, Yelp has and continues to make significant technology investments in developing its online platform and site interface, which is the central template as local cities use these tools and building blocks to acquire users and enable them to share their content. Yelp didn't explicitly say how much an average brand ambassador is paid, other than saying it is less than 100K. Then depending on the size of and the presence in a Yelp city, there is a telesales team, which according to management, are young college educated eager beavers, paid $30,000 - $40,000 base salaries with monetary upside in form of commissions for strong sales performance. In theory, if a local business has seen positive reviews, it should be more of a warm lead to selling advertising.However, there is a lag between the time it takes to establish a foothold in a locale, build the community that generates content, educate local businesses as to the merits of the product, and ultimately convince local businesses to sign up for a campaign that consists of at least six months. Yelp also refers to its Yelp cities as cohorts and tracks when they entered a market. Some of Yelp's earliest cohorts have exhibited strong growth in user generated content and ultimately advertising revenue (see exhibit 1).For a ballpark figure, Wendy Lim, Yelp's Investor Relations head, said an average annual campaign taking the form of cost per click advertising or a flat negotiated rate, generally cost $3,600 - $4,000 per year. Lastly, a local ad campaign enables paying customers to have featured ads that show up first during a specific yelp search, empowers local businesses the ability to post compelling pictures and share online videos, a call to action feature that prompt them to contact the business (for tracking purposes), and more controversially, it enables paying customers to block competitors from showing up on Yelp search results (see Exhibits 2 & 3). In a perfect world, Yelp should be able to drive strong contribution margins as the community manager and telesales team are on the only personnel, thus strong top line local ad revenue should be very profitable.Exhibit 1 - Source: Page 23 of Yelp's Q1 FY2014 Investor Slide deckExhibit 2 - Source: Page 28 of Yelp's Q1 FY2014 Investor Slide deckExhibit 3 - Source: Page 29 of Yelp's Q1 FY2014 Investor Slide deckAnalysis PortionNow with the overview of what Yelp does and how it generates revenue out of the way, let's dive into my analysis portion of the write up. At face value, if you read Yelp's earnings transcripts, investor presentations, and investor slides, you could see how some investors might get swept up in Yelp's tall tales of a massive total addressable market measured both in terms of local advertising dollars and the sheer number of global local businesses that could become eligible paying customers. In fact, during its two sell side presentations in Q4 2013 (UBS and Cantor Fitzgerald), Yelp's management team frequently mentioned a few buzz worthy big numbers. They said that according to the source, BIA/Kelsey, the total local advertising spend in 2013 was $133 billion, with online only making up 15% of this figure and that there are at least 20 million local businesses in the U.S. and an additional 25 million globally that could potentially become paying customers. Management then goes on to infer that Yelp is only in the second inning of this massive secular growth trend dynamic where local ad dollars will shift to online in the direction of Yelp. Moreover, they said cumulatively, the Yellow Pages properties still generate total revenues of upwards of $7 billion compared to Yelp's less than $250 million FY2013 revenue.However, according to management, surely Yelp's product is vastly superior and more compelling in value from a ROI perspective. Yelp then goes on to boast about its new and improved technology features like its dashboard that track the number of visitors, specifically tracking mobile calls, the number of people who click for directions, as well as other bells and whistles for tracking.Here's the problem, although Yelp quite impressively attracts compelling unique average monthly users to its web/mobile properties, with 132 million measured in Q1 2014, when investors start valuing stocks based on page views instead of revenue and EBITDA, it starts to feel like the technology bubble of 1999-2000 and we all know how that ended. Moreover, the fact that 31 million or 23% of these unique monthly users and 59 out of Yelp's 120 cities are international yet Yelp generated only 3% of its revenue from international local ads in Q1 FY2014. This could be the canary in the coal mine as Yelp appears to be aggressively chasing growth to appease Wall Street. I get it that the mystique of global revenues streams are sexy, yet better stewards of investors' capital would take a more deliberate approach as the Yelp business model clearly isn't translating overseas.Some bulls might snap back arguing that look at Yelp's impressive 2005 - 2006 cohort analysis (exhibit 1). Although I acknowledge that the growth in this small cohort of only six markets is quite impressive measured by all metrics, I would point out that this is classic cherry picking. Moreover, these first test bed markets, for Yelp, are the largest metropolitan locales in the United States, and there is only one San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York city, etc. If Yelp didn't experience success in these vibrant markets given their population, education levels which translate into tech savvy and awareness, and high disposable income then Yelp wouldn't have any positive EBITDA.Here is another problem, unlike the vertical integrators like Trip Advisors that closely monitors its user content with its editing staff, business owners have no way of verifying if negative user reviews are authentic content. In fact, I have written nine reviews on Trip Advisor, with one of them that was negative. Not only did Trip Advisor contact me to verify that I did eat at that restaurant, the actual restaurant owner requested a phone call with me. I accepted the owner's request and we had a productive twenty minute conversation. Initially, he was trying to verify if my review was legitimate and it was, but then the discussion evolved in a learning experience from my key findings. Now, I could have declined the phone call or email from the owner, but the overarching point is that unlike Yelp, Trip Advisor verifies its user content.Yelp's steadfast protection of its users' anonymity has led to a ground swell of negative business sentiments towards Yelp from some business owners. In fact, a small group of business owners have become so incensed with Yelp they leveled allegations that positive user reviews suddenly disappeared soon after they refused to embark on a Yelp advertising campaign. Perhaps more alarmingly, some vocal business owners claim that strong negative reviews appeared on Yelp and with no way of verifying them. This explains why Yelp only has 73,600 paying business customers, despite its 132 million unique monthly users and its 57 million cumulative reviews posted to its sites since inception. Moreover, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is actively investigating the 2,045 complaints leveled against Yelp from businesses during the time period of 2008 and 2014. I'm at a loss for words as to how any investor can feel comfortable owning this stock at this valuation when FTC is investigating its aggressive business tactics. Negative findings could permanently impair Yelp reputation and credibility with would be paying local business owners.Also, according to the SEC filings, Yelp insiders have sold $928 million worth of stock. This is unreal as only in America can you have an enterprise value of $4.3 billion and insiders have sold more absolute dollar value of stock than FY2013 revenue by a factor of three, yet retail investors are chasing this name.Conclusion: Given the risk factors argued above, retail investors should ignore Jim Cramer's recommendation and avoid shares of Yelp as this is a low probability long at current valuations.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2173783,23625,2014-04-29T15:35:57-04:00,,"Yelp Inc. (NYSE:YELP) is set to report FQ1 2014 earnings after the market closes on Wednesday, April 30th. Over the past 6 months, every company in the online ads business has said over and over again that the immediate focus of the industry is all about monetizing mobile ads. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been in a leader in that category, and correspondingly, has posted 2 blowout quarters in a row. Yelp is a restaurant and business reviews platform that offers an outstanding mobile experience. Since the beginning of March, Yelp stock has fallen 37% as the high momentum and social stocks have sold off steeply. Regardless of the stock plunge, this quarter, Wall Street is expecting Yelp to follow Facebook's lead and report year-over-year sales growth of 63%, and cut its quarterly loss from 8c per share last year to 6c per share. Here's what investors expect from Yelp on Wednesday.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy-side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see Estimates and Interactive Features for Yelp)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Yelp to report -6c EPS and $75.33M revenue, while the current Estimize.com consensus from 24 Buy-side and Independent contributing analysts is -3c EPS and $76.21M in revenue. This quarter, the buy side, as represented by the Estimize.com community, is expecting Yelp to beat Wall Street's expectations by a considerable margin on EPS and a small margin on revenue.Over the past 6 quarters, the consensus from Estimize.com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Yelp's revenue every quarter, but has also been less accurate in predicting EPS. By tapping into a wider range of contributors, including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non-professional investors, Estimize has created a data set that is more accurate than Wall Street up to 69.5% of the time, but more importantly, it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations. It has been confirmed by Deutsche Bank Quant. Research and an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case, we are seeing a larger differential than usual between the two groups' expectations on Yelp's earnings.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from -8c to 3c EPS and from $73.0M to $79.00M in revenues. This quarter, we're seeing a wide range of estimates on Yelp's EPS and moderate range of revenue predictions.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A wider distribution of estimates signals less agreement in the market, which could mean greater volatility post-earnings.This quarter, the Wall Street EPS consensus decreased from 1c to -6c, while the Estimize consensus fell from 1c to -3c. Meanwhile, Wall Street raised its revenue consensus from $73.77M to $75.33M, while the Estimize community took its numbers down to a low of $75.73M, before raising their consensus to $76.21M. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy, and upward analyst revenue revisions from the Estimize community are often a leading indicator of a strong report on the top line, although things look less attractive on the EPS chart.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is BradHewitt91, who projects -5c EPS and $76.7M in revenue. BradHewitt91 is ranked 11th overall among over 4,300 contributing analysts. Over the past 2 years, BradHewitt91 has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting EPS and revenue 53% and 51% of the time respectively throughout 758 estimates. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research, which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case, BradHewitt91 is expecting Yelp to beat estimates on revenue, but report between the consensuses from Wall Street and Estimize on EPS.Since the start of March, Yelp's stock has sold off relentlessly, but fundamental earnings estimates remain intact. Wall Street has even raised its revenue projections throughout the quarter, and the Estimize consensus has been rising going into the report. On the other hand, though, EPS estimates have fallen and neither the Estimize community nor Wall Street expect Yelp to be profitable this quarter.Disclosure: None"
2079073,62923,2014-03-10T17:08:29-04:00,"Earnings paint a blurry picture of the company's ability to generate revenues.Google will crush Yelp and its ilk in the long run.Rapidly increasing common share count, as a result of insider sales, indicates a possible lack of confidence.","Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is one of those exciting social media services that has grown appreciably in the recent past. At first look, you see a growth company with increasing sales and astounding stock returns of nearly 300% in the last 12 months. However, a closer look at the company reveals its expensive valuation, outrageous spending and unsustainable business model. Although Yelp appears to be progressing toward profitability, it is an illusion created by the majority of its tech-peers for they seem to be in similar situations, at least on paper. In Yelp's case, the risk attached to future returns is fairly high, especially considering its current expenditure. The company's continued practice of infusing earnings back into the business runs a high risk of failure, which is why I think investors should sell off their holdings or, might as well, short the stock.Earnings paint an unclear pictureThe San Francisco, California-based online urban city guide has improved sales at impressive rates in recent quarters, but its earnings have mostly remained in the negative territory. The company reported revenue growth of 41.7% to $70.65 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 from Q4 2012, meeting analysts' consensus estimates. However, net income was nearly 21% short of expectations. The company reported a net loss of $2.07 million, or $0.03 per share for the quarter.Q4 was not the only quarter it missed earnings. As a matter of fact, earnings were missed by wider margins in some of the preceding quarters. Somehow, the company manages to match the Street expectations for revenues but miss earnings by wide margins. Over the last five quarters, Yelp has reported revenues at average positive surprise of 3.38% while earnings were reported at an average negative surprise of 28.6%. None of those quarters saw more than 5.02% in revenue surprise. However, in Q2 and Q3 last year, earnings were missed by as much as 77% and 190% respectively.As shown in the graph above, the difference between gross profits and total operating expenses is almost constant. It begs the question: how long will Yelp give up all of its profits just so it can meet the revenue estimates? An anticipated loss, or a negative earnings, usually does not raise concerns about the company's fundamental health. However, an unanticipated or uncapped loss would raise an eyebrow or two. Sure enough, by 190% (or even 77%) earnings-miss, the company appears to have gone out of its way to reach the projected revenues. As long as it does that, it will keep growing revenues albeit at the expense of earnings. Perhaps a more important question to ask: would it be able to sustain the revenue growth once it takes its foot off the accelerator?It can be argued that revenue should be the main focus for a company in growth stages and there are other tech-companies with astronomically high P/Es, such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), etc., but these are businesses investing in future cash machines. Unlike Yelp they all have bright prospects, not to mention are market leaders in their respective industries. As a result, earnings reinvestment will only help in strengthening their positions. However, for Yelp, earnings reinvestment is like life support. In many ways, it resembles the case of BlackBerry (BBRY), which had very little scope after the revolutionary Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) Android devices swept the smartphone market.Google to trounce YelpThe playing field for leading listing services is becoming increasingly crowded, but Google will most likely trounce Yelp and others in this space, thanks to its one-stop nature of services. Google+ Reviews are integrated with local Google searches and Google Maps, giving it a reasonable edge over others. Already a high percentage of Google searches are embedded with Google+ Reviews, which will only help promote its app further.Moreover, Yelp fares worse than some of its peers in terms of customer satisfaction. As a matter of fact, researchers have been on a Yelp-bashing spree for quite some time, coming out with studies that illustrate the amount of falsified reviews at Yelp. Sadly, it appears the company cannot do much to prevent such activity. One can easily surpass Yelp's review filter even by creating multiple accounts if he/she regularly uses those accounts. This is another aspect where Google holds a significant edge as it could track fake accounts more effectively than others by monitoring usage on other services like Google Maps, Gmail, etc.Like that was not enough already, Google went a step ahead and made it possible for users to view menu, price, and availability of their preferred restaurants just by typing or speaking ""what's on the menu at [restaurant]"" on Google search. Clearly, this would push Yelp and others aside while Google would take the center stage and, in time, become the market leader. For that reason, Yelp's strategy of spending millions on marketing has a very strong possibility of backfiring. Unless it does something exceptionally revolutionary, it would probably end up surrendering its market share to bigger peers like Google.Rapidly increasing share count and insider salesIn recent quarters, the company's stock-based compensations have usually resulted in insiders dumping their shares on the open market as soon as they receive them. The liquidation of awarded shares has significantly increased Yelp's common share count. The company had about 60 million shares outstanding when it debuted in March 2012. As Illustrated in the graph below, the share count has increased 17.35% to 70.41 million in two years.At this rate, Yelp will have over 82.6 million outstanding shares in the next two years, and that kind of dilution is bound to negatively impact its share price. However, it will take some time before the effects become evident.According to OpenInsider.com, a service that screens SEC filings, insiders appear to be taking advantage of Yelp's rising share prices. It is noteworthy to see key officers (CEO, CFO, COO) and directors regularly exercising their options or converting their class B stocks so as to sell them directly on the open market. For instance, Yelp's director Jeremy Levine disposed nearly 70% - a sale worth $20.7 million - of his stake in the company last December. These sales clearly show the scant confidence that the company's top-most insiders have in its current valuation.Bottom lineFrom a growth-centric standpoint, Yelp fails to convince me as it has missed earnings by huge margins during recent quarters. The company is in direct competition with Google, which - with its aggressive moves - will probably swallow Yelp's market share in future. Moreover, it has been rapidly increasing its share count and a lack of confidence is conspicuous among its insiders. In view of all that, it is about time Yelp makes a significant correction.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2135263,54222,2014-04-10T08:21:49-04:00,"Yelp is rapidly growing its customer base by launching new features.Yelp's focus on international expansion has been fruitful so far, enabling the company to diversify its business.Yelp has a strong balance sheet and outstanding earnings growth projections, making it a good long-term buy.","Over the past one month, shares of online local guide Yelp (NYSE:YELP) have crashed a massive 30%. This would come as a big surprise to investors after Yelp's overwhelming performance in 2013. In fact, when Yelp posted its fourth-quarter results a couple of months ago, its revenue grew a solid 72% year-over-year to $70.7 million, while adjusted EBITDA increased 470% year-over-year to $10.4 million.Yelp is expected to continue its rapid growth this year as well. Its revenue for the current quarter is expected to jump 60% year-over-year. The company has grown smartly through expansion and acquisitions, and investors would certainly think that now is a good time to add more Yelp shares to their portfolio. But would that be correct? Let's check.Focus on key areas to drive growthYelp's acquisition of its European rival Qype has enabled it to expand internationally, especially in Europe. In addition, despite the tremendous progress that Yelp has made, management feels that it is ""just scratching the surface of the enormous local opportunity."" Going forward, Yelp is continuously striving to become the de-facto local search engine for the world.The company is focusing on three key themes that are the focus of its business, and it has made considerable progress in them. Under the first theme, Yelp is focusing on technological advancements. With the increasing usage of smartphones and tablets in mind, Yelp has introduced a number of new features and functions that will help contributors, consumers, and business owners. This will enable its users to get the same great experience on a range of different devices. Also, one of the most notable features introduced by Yelp is that users can post reviews based on their likes and dislikes.Yelp has received an enthusiastic response for these new features, as 1.1 million reviews in the fourth quarter, which is 30% of total new reviews, were posted on mobile. Also, it has launched a preloaded app for the Kindle Fire, and began powering local search for the Kindle platform. This became yet another way for its users to access Yelp. All these new developments turned right for the company, as the majority of the searches are now coming from mobile. Now, its users can find local businesses wherever they are and on whatever device they are using.Under the second theme, Yelp is focusing on its expansion plans. We already saw that Yelp has acquired its rival Qype. Also, it has completed Qype's integration in Germany, which is its largest market, and transferred around 1.8 million reviews and approximately 1.4 million photos to Yelp.Last year, Yelp increased its European sales numbers with the help of advertisements, and also by providing language support for three regions -- France, Spain, and Germany. Yelp operates in 24 countries around the world, and 21% of its fourth-quarter traffic came from outside the U.S. These efforts have placed Yelp on the road to become an international brand.Product development movesLastly, Yelp is focused on strengthening its ties with local business owners. Its Revenue Estimator function has helped businesses evaluate the leads they get from Yelp. It helps consumers in not only discovering the business, but also to place their orders. Also, Yelp's call to action feature has received great response, with local businesses and national advertisers driving more than 40,000 customer leads per week to Yelp advertisers. And one of the most interesting features that the company has added is SeatMe, which will allow its users to reserve tables at a restaurant, bar, or a lounge.Looking forward, the company will continue focusing on these areas in 2014, along with expanding in new markets and adding new features to the existing ones. Management is looking to provide its users with the best experience, and is of the opinion that:A look at the fundamentalsAlso, if we take a look at Yelp's balance sheet, we find that the company is strong. Yelp has no debt, and has a strong cash position of almost $390 million. In addition, Yelp is also cash flow positive. In the last twelve months, Yelp has generated operating cash flow of $21.4 million, while levered cash flow was $6.08 million.The only thing that can discourage investors is a high forward P/E ratio of almost 187. However, Yelp's earnings are growing at a solid pace, and over the next five years, they are expected to grow at the rate of 43% per year. So, investors shouldn't be scared of a high forward P/E, since the company is delivering solid growth.ConclusionSo, we see that Yelp has grown tremendously in the past, and the trend is expected to continue going forward. The company is focusing on a number of opportunities to propel its growth, and a strong balance sheet should help it in this regard. So, investors should definitely consider capitalizing on Yelp's recent crash and load up more shares, as the stock looks like a good long-term holding.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2143663,23478,2014-04-15T20:24:04-04:00,,"With the plunge in tech shares and the NASDAQ Composite index generally in recent days, it's worth looking at the underlying businesses of some momentum stocks. Below we see substantial 1-month declines in the shares of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Priceline (PCLN), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and, leading the descent, Yelp (NYSE:YELP).YELP data by YChartsThese and other high-flyers, of course, are particularly vulnerable because they trade at lofty valuations. Yelp, for instance, garners a market cap of some $4.7 billion, even after its plunge, on just $233.0 million in 2013 sales. That's a price-to-sales ratio (we won't bother with a PE ratio since there aren't any earnings) of about 18. And if you own the shares, or are thinking of bargain hunting among social media stocks, some quiet time with the 10-K is in order.YELP Revenue (Quarterly) data by YChartsYou know Yelp. People post reviews of local businesses - 52.8 million of them by the end of 2013 - and consumers read the reviews as a buying guide of sorts. Crowd sourcing of content is far from perfect: about 30% of the reviews are sufficiently defective as to be excluded from the starred rankings of the businesses. Regardless, the site draws about 120 million unique visitors a month. All around, it's a useful service.Is there a business, too? There is, but it isn't an easy one, as merchant participation isn't as strong as that of consumers. (Some businesses hate Yelp.) Of 54.5 million businesses listed on Yelp, just 1.5 million have, in the site's vernacular, ""claimed"" their listing. It is those businesses that care enough to take control of their Yelp page, perhaps adding some information of their own, that constitute the lead list Yelp uses to try to sell ads to on the site. And success there has been difficult to come by, too. Of the 1.5 million businesses that have ""claimed"" their listing, only 67,000 were active advertisers or otherwise revenue sources for Yelp in the fourth quarter of 2013.Investors anxious to see Yelp quickly turn into a far bigger business and report substantial profits may be disappointed. ""We do not expect to be profitable in the near term,"" Yelp informs in the 10-K, as big investments to build the business continue. Also, the natural growth rate of Yelp's networks - each metropolitan area it operates in is essentially a separate market; people in Philadelphia, after all, aren't looking to pop out for sushi in Atlanta - turns out to be kind of slow.Yelp's six earliest markets, set up in 2005-2006, on average each had at year-end 2013: 3.6 million business reviews accumulated; brought in $14.3 million in advertising revenue; and grew revenue-wise by 53% last year. But the 2009-1010 cohort of 18 markets, hardly new, averaged just 240,000 reviews and brought in $801,000 each in advertising. That latter group is growing faster, at 102% last year, but it's also made up of relatively smaller metropolitan areas so ultimate size could be limited.The markets take years to mature. Reviews gradually pile up. Consumers consult them. And, finally, merchants take an interest and doll up their Yelp pages a bit and, just maybe, buy an ad on the site. Local advertising on the site was about $58 million in the fourth quarter, so those 67,000 active merchants coughed up less than $1,000 each during the quarter.Having such tiny customers is a challenge. TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), which is in many ways similar to Yelp, is blessed by its very large customers. Some 47% of its revenue comes from the combination of Priceline and Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), online travel agencies that pay when consumers click from TripAdvisor through to their sites to make purchases. TripAdvisor is bigger, with more than twice as many reviews, or 125 million. And it had profit of $205.4 million in 2013 on revenues of $944.7 million.TripAdvisor also trades at lofty multiples, and the market has pushed its shares down 23% during the past month. But it is a far more developed business than Yelp and its revenue model - attracting big-spending consumers with its content and then sending them on to a handful of travel sites, which pay it fees - seems easier to execute.Targeting local merchants, Yelp has plenty of competition. Opentable (NASDAQ:OPEN) is for making reservations at restaurants (a function Yelp added with a recent acquisition) but it also features starred reviews of the eateries. Opentable's software is embedded in restaurants and the company is nicely profitable.OPEN PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsGroupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), the daily deals company, targets many of the same local merchants as Yelp. Its sales process, too, is challenging because it sells to these businesses. And newly-public GrubHub (NYSE:GRUB) delivers restaurant meals to consumers (another function Yelp has added).Yelp's review categories are led by shopping and restaurants. But its top advertising category is home and local services, putting in it direct competition with Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI). Among risk factors, Yelp mentions this:The good news is that Yelp's operating losses have been narrowing. Its sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue has declined. It has nearly $400 million in the bank. And the site has a great market position with consumers looking for what the company calls online word-of-mouth.But those factors are a long way from adding up to a $4.7 billion market cap.Jeff Bailey, The Editor of YCharts, is a former reporter, editor and columnist at the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.Disclosure: None"

The valuation is priced for perfection and a best case scenario.There are many risks that threaten to slow Yelp's future growth considerably.Management thinks the company is massively overvalued, having sold 41% of its shares in the last 4 months.Even under the best case scenario, Yelp is likely to return just 13% CAGR over the next 10 years. The long-term stock market return is 9% CAGR, 11.1% with dividends.There are many high-yielding stocks with lower risk and volatility that are likely to outperform Yelp over the long run.","There is nothing quite like finding a fast growing tech stock to inspire dreams of easy money to get an investor's blood pumping. Although, history shows that often it is the slow, steady and boring dividend paying stocks that provide the best returns. This is not to say that growth stocks don't deserve a spot in one's diversified portfolio. However, it does mean that investors must be careful to make sure that these faster growing, riskier companies are compensating the increased risk and volatility. As I was researching growth stocks I came across Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and became intrigued by its growth story and decided to analyze whether an investment at the current price made sense. The answer is a definitive ""No"".Company Overview:Yelp is a San Francisco based company that has grown into one of the largest local guide service companies in the world. The company's website and apps offer customers reviews of local businesses such as restaurants, dentists, mechanics and boutiques. The company makes money off of local advertising. In addition, through the Yelp App merchants can message potential customers and offer Yelp Deals and coupons which is like Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). It allows customers to make reservations at restaurants from the app similar to OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN). The company operates internationally with customers in: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.Recent Results:Yelp is growing like a weed. By the end of 2013 the company had 120 million unique monthly visitors and over 53 million reviews. The majority of users utilize the website but the mobile App is growing quickly and attracted 10.6 million users thus far.During the 4th quarter the company reported:Full Year 2013 Results were:The company's guidance for 2014 was:Catalysts For Growth:According to the company's Q4 investor deck presentation there are 74 million businesses in the world. As of 2014 Yelp has 67,200 businesses signed up which represents just 0.09% market share. In addition, total US local ad spending is expected to grow to $145 billion in 2016. Yelp's current $233 million in revenue represents just 0.16% of the potential market.The strongest potential for growth comes from international users. Yelp reports that international reviews were up 225% in 2013 compared to 2012, while unique visitors were up 101% and revenues increased 256%.Indeed when one hears figures such as these it is hard not to get excited about Yelp's growth prospects. However, before buying shares investors should be aware of certain risks.Risks:Increasing competition: According to Yelp's Engineering blog, competition is growing from the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI) and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP). The moat around Yelp's business is only its first mover advantage. The idea is if Yelp can garner the biggest following early on then customers won't bother trying a competitor's products because the largest amount of data is already available at Yelp.Quality Control Failures:A recent study from the Harvard business school found that 16% of Yelp's reviews are falsified. The study analyzed 316,415 reviews of 3,625 restaurants and found that 99% of Boston's restaurants had at least one false review. The false reviews were mostly by owners of competing restaurants and included a combination of praise for one's own restaurant and attacking competitors.Rampant Share Dilution:In 2009, Yelp spent $1 million on stock options. In 2014, Yelp is projecting $43-$45 million. This amounts to a 89% CAGR in stock option grants and surpasses the growth rate of sales, users or reviews on the site. In 2014, stock option grants are projected to grow at 59-67% faster than the anticipated growth in sales of 51-54%. Meanwhile the total share count is growing by 12.3% CAGR since mid 2012. This increase in the share count will make it harder to grow earnings, once they appear.Growth in expenses is keeping up with growth in revenues:In the last 2 years revenues have soared 216% or 78% CAGR. Meanwhile G&A expenses, the cost of running the business, have soared at 177% or 67% CAGR. Now this is understandable given how fast the company is growing, spending money on advertising, and expanding globally. However, the risk is that those expansion costs continue to grow quickly while the ability to monetize international users proves not as successful. Google and Facebook have found that it takes 2-3 Canadian or European users to be as profitable as one US user. Other parts of the world are even less profitable requiring 5-10 users to match each American. If this finding proves true for international Yelp users then the heavy spending to expand internationally will result in far less of a boost in sales and earnings than previously anticipated.Massive insider selling:To the tune of 41% of insider shares in the last 4 months alone. The CEO, Jeremy Stoppleman, has exercised $15.25 million of stock options in the last year and seems to own almost no shares. Instead, Mr. Stoppleman on a weekly basis seems to convert free stock options to the tune of about 15,000 shares and then sell them that day.The rampant insider selling over the last 4 months began at a stock price of $65.63. This indicates that management (who knows the workings of the company and its long term growth prospects the best) believes that at a price 50% below today's price the stock was blatantly overvalued. As I'm about to show - management is very likely correct.As seen in this table, I am modeling Yelp's earnings growth out over the next 30 years. I assume the 2016 EPS based on analysts' consensus and then model the expected 43% EPS growth for years 2017-2018. For the next 5 year period I model a slow down to 30% CAGR. Each additional 5 year period models 20%, 15% and 10% growth. In total, my model expects a blistering 21% CAGR in earnings over the next 3 decades. I attempt to apply various multiples to determine the likely price in 2018, 2023, 2028, 2033, 2038 and 2043. Next I discount by the stock market's 1871-2013 CAGR of 9% to find the present fair value. I calculate the discount to that fair value and finally determine the expect 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 year CAGR that investors can expect from Yelp given its current price. Comparing this anticipated total return to the stock market's historical 9% CAGR (without dividends) and 11.1% CAGR (with dividend reinvestment) can give us an idea if Yelp satisfies the criteria of offering substantially greater reward for its much higher risk. The results are sobering.Despite a 53% EPS CAGR through 2018 and an estimated 75 PE Yelp is expected to only generate 7.1% CAGR over the next 5 years. The best results are the anticipated 10 year returns of 13% CAGR assuming a PE of 53. From there it just gets worse for Yelp; culminating in a 30 year CAGR of just 8.6% despite a 245 fold increase in earnings over that time. This is purely a result of the sky high current valuation. If the price of Yelp were to drop to $50, a 30% discount from when management began massive insider selling, the results become quite different. The 5 year projected average return becomes 25.2% CAGR and the 10 year return becomes 23.3% CAGR. Sadly the 30 year CAGR only increases to 11.53% which barely beats the stock market's dividend adjusted results. This shows just how overvalued Yelp is. Its truly long term returns simply cannot match the returns of much safer, less volatile dividend stocks.Examples of such stocks are Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP), Prospect Capital (NASDAQ:PSEC) and Main Street Capital (NYSE:MAIN). These high dividend paying companies are far less risky and volatile than Yelp. Yet because of the power of dividends and strong dividend growth these companies are likely to return 14.5-17% CAGR when dividends are reinvested. This is because the total return of these kinds of companies is determined by the yield+dividend growth rate. The yields on Brookfield, Main Street and Prospect Capital are 5.1%, 7.2% and 12.2% respectively. The projected dividend growth rates are 10%, 8.5% and 2.7%. Adjusting for dividend reinvestment nets projected long-term total returns of 15.87%, 14.56% and 16.83% CAGR respectively. Because the nature of growth stocks is higher risk and higher volatility it is important for growth stock investors to look at the projected returns of the companies they own and ask whether they can beat not only the market's 11.1% long term return but the 14-17% that high quality dividend payers can generate. After all, if a growth stock at a reasonable price, can generate 20-25% CAGR over 5-15 years then it is certainly deserves a spot in a diversified portfolio. However, if a stock, such as Yelp, with a massive potential growth runway ahead of it is only likely to return mediocre market matching results then it is not worth risking one's capital on.So does this mean that Yelp is a stock worth shorting? Absolutely not. Its short interest is 21.4% which indicates a potential for a large short squeeze. The short ratio of 1.6 days indicates that the potential pop would be short lived but any speculators who short Yelp are still risking a margin call that costs them 20-40% of their capital. As the noted economist John Maynard Keynes stated, ""The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.""Conclusion:Yelp is a great service and an innovative company. Its potential for revenue and earnings growth is truly staggering. However, the risks the company is facing coupled with the least shareholder friendly management I have ever seen gives one reason to pass on Yelp as a long-term investment. If management had confidence in the growth of Yelp then certainly the CEO would hold at least some of the free shares the company is handing him ($312,500/week on average). Such brazen acts of shareholder dilution serve a valuable purpose that they tell us that Yelp is worth far less than $65/share which is the price at which management began its epic share dump. Perhaps one can make money shorting the stock or speculating with options but that is the realm of the gambler not the investor. For market crushing long-term returns investors would be best served to look elsewhere.Disclosure: I am long PSEC. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

2170293,23479,2014-04-28T16:40:15-04:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is set to release its Q1 2014 earnings on Wednesday, April 30th. In the last three months, Yelp's stock price, after hitting a lifetime high of $101.75 has declined to $57.63, which is in line with our stock price estimate of $53.77. While the company continues to report good growth in its local ads business, we believe that the market was over estimating the growth rate for the company, and this may be the reason for the recent 45% correction in the stock price as the market tempered its expectation.Therefore, we expect the growth in local ads business to be the key focal point in this earnings announcement. Furthermore, we will continue to monitor the growth for Deal, Partnership and Other services (DPO) business as the company had launched new services last year, and we expect the revenues from these services to form a significant portion of division's revenues this year. Moreover, we will be on the lookout for any key takeaways regarding its expansion process outside the U.S.Outlook for Q1 and 2014For Q1 FY14, the company guided revenues to be in $73.5 - $74.5 million range, representing growth of approximately 60% compared to the first quarter of 2013. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $8 million to $9 million. For the full year, Yelp projects net revenue to be in $353 - $358 million range, and adjusted EBITDA to be in $54 - $58 million range.Growth In Local Ads Business In FocusThe local ads business currently accounts for around 80% of Yelp's stock value and is its biggest revenue source. Yelp's active business accounts have grown at a rapid rate, from 40,000 in 2012 to over 67,000 in 2013. The primary drivers for Yelp's account growth are its international expansion efforts and the cumulative increase in reviews on the Yelp site for its existing markets. The company has a total addressable market (TAM) of 73 million local businesses in the world, of which 53 million are present in North America, Europe and New Zealand. While Yelp continues to expand its presence in the U.S., it has also increased its reach to over 24 countries.We expect that the number of active business accounts will continue to grow as Yelp expands. Furthermore, we expect average revenue per active business account for Yelp to grow from $2,890 in 2013 to $3,220, by 2020. In this earnings announcement, we continue to monitor these performance metrics to ascertain whether the company will be able to maintain its growth trajectory going forward.Revenue Growth From Deals Platform In FocusIn a move to diversify its revenue stream, Yelp expanded its services in 2013 by introducing new features such as call to action, which lets a business promote its services by offering discounts, and delivery platform to its portfolio. While earlier Yelp was offering these services only in the U.S., and that too for a limited category i.e. food, it has expanded these services to other countries like Canada and encompasses other categories such as spas, yoga studios, salons and dentist appointments. If these delivery services gain traction among Yelp users, Yelp's DPO division can be an important growth driver going forward. In this earnings announcement, the focus will be on revenue growth from these services. Currently, Yelp's DPO division contributes only 6% to total revenues. However, we expect its contribution to increase to 8% by 2020.Our price estimate for Yelp stands at $54, which is inline with the current market price. We invite the reader to adjust the model and create his or her own alternative valuation.Disclosure: No positions"
2009941,25258,2014-02-11T02:09:45-05:00,,"It was a little under two years ago when Yelp (YELP), a local review service, made its public debut on the financial markets. In March 2012, the company listed its shares at $15 giving it an $898 million valuation at the time. Flash forward to today and the company now trades with a market capitalization of $5.91 billion. As of the last market close on February 6, Yelp last traded at $89.46, a nearly 500% rise since its IPO.From the standpoint of most investors, this would be considered a success. However there remains the question of whether the share price adequately reflects the company's fundamental value. After all, popular sentiment and financial realities can often be worlds apart. A brief look at the company's financials raises some immediate questions considering the rapid rise experienced over the past two years.While revenue has significantly risen, Yelp's bottom line has stagnated. With increases in net revenue, sales and marketing expenses have appeared to have grown nearly just as fast. It is noteworthy to see that insiders continue to sell off their holdings and stock-based compensation continues to rise. Yelp appears to be progressing towards profitability in the near future but will the earnings expectations be nearly as promising as the market price has now factored in?A Look At The FinancialsFor the full year of 2013, Yelp's net revenue amounted to $232.99 million while total costs and expenses added up to $241.81 million. Factoring in other losses, the company's net loss attributable to shareholders resulted in $10.07 million. Taking a look three years prior and we see a similar earnings result. For the full year of 2010, Yelp's net revenue amounted to $47.73 million while the company's net loss amounted to $9.74 million.In the last year alone, Yelp's revenue rose 69%. Yet at the same time, sales & marketing expenses rose 53.6% and product development expenses rose 86.8% respectively. The company continues to push hard to grow its customer base and retain its existing clients. While revenue is naturally the focus for any growth-stage company, it will be important to see if Yelp can continue its revenue growth once the company takes its foot off the accelerator.A Look At Insider SalesDespite the lack of net income attributable to investors to date, insiders have already taken advantage of current share prices. A look at the graph below illustrates the limited confidence in the company's current valuation as seen by key officers. CEO Jeremy Stoppelman, CFO Robert Krolik, COO Geoffrey Donaker, and SVP Laurence Wilson continue to exercise their options or convert their class B stock in order to sell directly on the open market. The source of the chart below can be found here.Similarly, it was only two months ago when director Jeremy Levine felt comfortable in disposing nearly 70% of his holding in Yelp at an average share price of $60.88. The direct transaction resulted in a sale worth $20.68 million. He now owns a total of 150,000 shares in the company despite once having 882,656 shares throughout most of 2013.Interestingly enough, stock-based compensation also played a large role in the company's lack of profitability to date according to the latest earnings results. For the full year of 2012, total stock-based compensation expenses added up to $14.88 million. For 2013, this rose to $26.68 million. The 79% increase in this category more than covered the company's net loss of $10.07 million for the year.A Look At The Playing FieldWhile Yelp may be a leading listing service for local reviews, it's important to remember that the space is becoming increasingly crowded. While the company most often receives a comparison to Angie's List (ANGI) as a public pure-play competitor, it's important to remember that Yelp is facing competition from a large array of companies. Even in its own engineering blog, Yelp shows some of the competition is coming from sources investors may not have considered. Google (GOOG), Facebook (FB), Foursquare, Yellowbook, and TripAdvisor (TRIP) are all encroaching on some aspect of Yelp's market opportunity.Additionally, there are multiple problems beginning to arise on the front of customer satisfaction. A partial collection of such issues are shown below:Final Thoughts:From an entirely growth-centric perspective, Yelp continues to perform well. The company's revenue is climbing quickly. Indeed, the book value has also significantly improved due to the company's recent offering. Yet there remains the question if the company's market value has far exceeded a fair relationship with this book value. With its $5.91 billion market capitalization, Yelp now maintains total assets of $515.98 million in total assets.The company's latest offering helped to increase the amount of cash on hand. From December 2012 to December 2013, the company increased their cash reserves from $389.76 million from $95.12 million. This reserve will help to stem the ongoing losses. Yet the lack of profitability and ongoing dilution is unlikely to remain fruitful for investors over the long term. This is especially the case as expenses keep pace with the revenue gains and no bottom-line progress has been seen for 3 years.Yelp's outstanding share count continues to grow, and this only further dilutes the potential earnings now factored into the rising share price. This is problematic for a company now sporting a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 216.68 based on analyst estimates of $0.41/share by the end of 2015. Can it be that the local-listing titan deserves such a high multiple based on its financial progress to date? Based on the insider trading habits of the most active company employees, that sure doesn't appear to be the case.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2001331,23479,2014-02-06T16:11:08-05:00,,"Yelp‘s (NYSE:YELP) results once again showed the effect of rapid expansion as revenue grew 72% year over year to $70.7 million in the quarter. Although, Yelp continued to report a net loss of $2.1 million in the quarter, its adjusted EBITDA improved by 470% year over year to $10.4 million. For the full year, Yelp’s revenues grew by 69% from $137.6 million in 2012 to $233 million. Adjusted EBITDA for the full year 2013 was approximately $29.4 million compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $4.6 million for the prior year.Yelp continued to report superlative growth for all its performance metrics. The company reported 47% growth in cumulative reviews to 53 million and 39% increase in average unique monthly visitors to 120 million. While active local business accounts increased by 69% year over year to 67,200, claimed local businesses increased to 1.5 million. In this article, we will discuss Yelp’s Q4 results.Outlook for Q1 and 2014For Q1 FY14, the company expects revenues to be in the $73.5 – $74.5 million range, representing growth of approximately 60% compared to the first quarter of 2013. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $8 million to $9 million. For the full year, Yelp projects net revenue to be in the $353 – $358 million range, and adjusted EBITDA to be in the $54 – $58 million range.Local Ads Business Revenues ImprovesThe local ads business currently accounts for over 75% of Yelp’s stock value and is its biggest revenue source. During the quarter, we estimate that the revenue from this division grew to $59 million, and active business accounts grew to 67,200. The primary reason for growth in this driver is the integration of Qype, which was acquired by Yelp in 2012. With Yelp’s local business, this was instrumental in increasing the cumulative reviews across Yelp’s international site.Furthermore, our analysis indicates that average revenue per active local business (ARPALB) for the company grew by 5.8% in 2013 to $2887. The ARPALB improved as revenue from older cohorts or regions increased in line with company’s expectation, as stated by us in our previous note.Mobile Fuels Ad RevenuesYelp competes with Google, Yahoo, Facebook and AOL for ad revenue. The unique visitors count is the primary driver for this division, and during the quarter monthly unique visitors grew to 120 million. Additionally, 44% of these unique visitors used mobile devices for accessing Yelp’s services, which equates to ~53 million monthly unique mobile users. During the quarter, 59% of all Yelp’s searches were via mobile and 47% of ads impressions were served on mobile devices. Yelp improved the mobile experience by rolling out new features for both contributors and customers. The growing number of consumers searching for local businesses online constitutes Yelp’s existing market, and in addition to company’s global expansion plans, the adoption of Yelp’s mobile platform will drive this growth in unique visitors on the Yelp site, in our view.Deals Revenues ImprovesYelp’s deal, partnership and other services (DPO) division has been slow to take off. Currently, Yelp generates revenue from this division through any transaction that might occur on its website. Yelp’s deals platform allows merchants to promote themselves, and offer discounted goods and services on a real-time basis to consumers directly on Yelp’s website and mobile app. Yelp charges a fee on Yelp Deals for acting as an agent in these transactions.Yelp launched new initiatives such as call to action and delivery platform to close the loop between discovering a business on Yelp and making a purchase at that business. As a result, the company is now seeing over 10,000 food orders each week. Additionally, the call to action feature has seen great traction with local businesses and national advertisers alike, driving more than 40,000 customer leads per week to Yelp advertisers. We believe that the newly launched services will drive revenues at DPO division going ahead.We are in the process of updating our Yelp model. At present, we have $44.44 price estimate on Yelp, which is 40% below its current market price.Disclosure: No positions"
1998491,25381,2014-02-06T06:06:06-05:00,,"We live in an age when all news is good news. On Wednesday evening, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) announced its results for the quarter and the results were just as I suspected and the investors of the company are celebrating these results even though there isn't much to celebrate for in these results.Yelp was able to beat the lowered estimates of the analysts, but this was already expected, evidenced by the massive run-up in the company's share price in the recent months. In fact, since November, Yelp's shares have appreciated by nearly 30% due to the expectations that the company would beat the estimates.Yelp generated $70.7 million in revenues and a loss of 3 cents per share in net profits while the analysts were looking for $67.3 million in revenues and a loss of 3 cents per share. The company's revenue beat the estimates but the net profit figure was in-line with the expectations. For the full-year, Yelp generated $233 million in revenues and 15 cents per share in net loss. Basically, 2013 was another profitless year for Yelp.For the full-year of 2014, Yelp guided for revenues of $356 million. Between 2009 and 2012, Yelp's revenues grew by an annual average of 74.87%. Last year, the revenue growth rate slowed down to 69.37% and in 2014 it is expected to slow down further to 52.79% according to the company's guidance. Basically, Yelp told us that its growth rate will fall from mid-70s to low-50s by the end of this year and the investors are celebrating this. I understand that 53% is still an impressive growth rate; however, Yelp's current share price more than bakes that into account. When we look at quarter-to-quarter growth, the company's trailing average growth rate is around 14.51%, while the guidance for the first quarter of 2014 calls for a sequential growth of 4.74%, a much slower rate. Yelp expects a sharp drop in its growth rate in 2014, especially in the first part of the year.As if Yelp wasn't already ridiculously overpriced, the company also keeps increasing the dilution for the shareholders. This comes from issuing new shares and paying many employees in stock options. In fact, issuing and selling stocks have become something like a business plan for the company, and perhaps its only hope of making a profit. In 2011, Yelp had 15.29 million outstanding shares which rose sharply to 54.15 million in 2012 and it rose further to 65.69 million in 2013. Currently, Yelp has 68.86 million outstanding shares, giving the company a market value of $5.51 billion (compared to the company's book value of $486 million). Currently, Yelp trades for 10 times its book value and 22 times its revenue.To add insult to injury, Yelp is not expecting to be profitable in 2014 either. Here is what the company reported: ""Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $54 million to $58 million. Stock-based compensation is expected to be in the range of $43 million to $45 million, and depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately 5% of revenue."" Yelp's ""adjusted EBITDA"" doesn't include stock-based compensation or depreciation and amortization. Since the company expects its 2014 revenues to be $356 million, its depreciation and amortization charge will be around $18 million and its stock based compensation will be around $44 million. Before we add taxes or other expenses, we are already at a loss of $6 million dollars when we add stock based compensation, depreciation and amortization to the company's adjusted EBITDA guidance. This guarantees that if Yelp doesn't beat its guidance by a large margin, it will have another unprofitable year.By the way, Yelp's stock-based compensation was $4.87 million in 2011, $14.88 million in 2012, $26.12 million in 2013 and it is going to be $44 million this year according to the company's guidance. Yelp just turned into a machine where management cashes out their stock options on monthly basis while profits will not be seen anytime soon, if ever. At this rate, the number of Yelp's outstanding shares will be far above 70 million by this time of next year. Currently, the company's CEO Jeremy Stoppelman doesn't even hold a share of the company because he sells every share he is awarded within 24 hours, just like most other senior managers at the company.In the near future, most of Yelp's growth will come from outside of North America where the company is reaching saturation. This is why Yelp is entering new markets such as Norway, Portugal, New Zealand, Brazil and Turkey in order to boost its growth numbers. The problem is that while Yelp can grow its user base in these countries at a rapid rate, it can't grow its revenues that quickly. As we know from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), an American or Canadian viewer will generate as much advertising revenue as 2-3 European viewers and 5-10 viewers from other parts of the world. Yelp doesn't tell us much information about metrics. For example, we don't know the distribution of the website's users by geographical region other than saying that 21% of the page views come from outside of the US (during the conference call, the company also announced that the international revenues represent 4% of total revenues for the company while representing 21% of the page views.Since the company's total page views for the quarter was 120 million and total revenues were $70.7 million, we can calculate that 25.2 million viewers came from international markets and 94.8 million viewers came from the US. If we look at the averages, the average American viewer generated 71 cents in revenues whereas the average international viewer generated 11 cents in revenues. Since most of Yelp's future growth will come from the international markets, this doesn't bode well for the company). Also, keep in mind that if Yelp got nearly 95 million unique visitors in the US, the company is pretty close to reaching saturation. Not everyone in the country will check an online review site to find a barber or a restaurant since many people already know where to do their shopping in their town. Besides, the competition is barely getting started since Facebook and Google both have their local business solutions now. Until now, Yelp enjoyed nearly no competition but things are changing as we speak.Yelp is currently valued for perfection and the company's current valuation reflects 50-60% annual growth rate for more than a decade but the company's growth is already slowing down. In Yelp's guidance and earnings report, there is very little to cheer for and very much to be worried about. Yelp's management will continue to reward themselves with stock options while they dilute the shareholders of the company relentlessly.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

They're both part of the litany of social media stocks that are, in my opinion, commanding much higher valuation than they're wroth.2. They're both companies that I've had short positions in. I closed my Yelp short yesterday for gains because I didn't feel like dealing with the heartburn of a binary event. Pandora, I remain short via vanilla puts.Yelp has been on a hell of a run since its IPO and it has more than tripled in the last year alone. In the last six months, Yelp is up nearly 50%.The company, as well as Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) and other social media stocks, got a lift from the recent positive earnings reported by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Analysts are going to be looking for EPS of -$0.03, an increase of $0.03 from last year. Revenues are expected to come in at $67.22 million, a 63.3% increase from last year.(source - Yahoo Finance!)Yelp makes a majority of its money from businesses that want to promote through the website. Last quarter, Yelp grew these ad revenues 80%. Yelp's advertising model has been compared to Facebook's and bulls on the company are expecting positive results based on the same success that Facebook had monetizing advertising.Investors are also going to be looking for insight from Yelp as to who they plan on growing internationally, and then monetizing these markets. Additionally, innovation in advertising is also sought from bulls on the company.Bears like me have argued that the company's valuation is too far out of whack, and that Yelp is a prime candidate to eventually be swallowed by Google reviews.Pandora has also fared extremely well over the last twelve months, with the market placing a value of over $6 billion on the streaming music provider. After hitting lows of barely under $10 in 2013, the company has nearly quadrupled. In the last six months, the company has rewarded investors handsomely as well, to the tune of almost 70%. Pandora, has been a winner - so far.The company is expected to report earnings ex-items (non-GAAP) of $0.04-$0.08 on revenue of $196 million for the full quarter.(source - Yahoo Finance!)Investors will also have the magnifying glass on mobile with Pandora - looking for improvement in monetizing its mobile platform.Active listeners have continued to grow over the past year, even in the face of Apple's iTunes Radio - investors will expect this to translate directly to revenue growth. Knowing that active listener growth continues to inch forward will make the guidance on this call the most important part, in this investor's opinion. How will the company innovate and grow in the coming year?At the end of the day, bulls on Pandora are going to be looking for another small nudge in the direction of profitability.There has been increased competition for Pandora - Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Play Music and Spotify, to name two. This quarter also serves as the first full quarter going up against Apple's iTunes Radio, which is packaged with every Mac, iPhone, and iPad that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) sells.Bears like myself are going to be looking for the potential effects of the relationship between the two companies. I continue to worry about Pandora's long term prospects trying to compete with Google, Apple, and Sirius (NASDAQ:SIRI).ConclusionSocial media stocks like these are not where I want to get caught in the midst of a macro market correction, like we seem to be seeing over the past two weeks. Companies with massive valuations like Yelp and Pandora are prime targets for people to pull their money out of when the market gets skittish.Additionally, with the economy potentially starting to slow, there's going to be a tall task ahead for these companies to continue to grow at the rate they are expected to by the markets. I would advise investors to take caution in buying these names at these levels in the midst of this market. I'm bearish long term on both of these names, and wish investors the best of luck going forward.Disclosure: If the market continues to rocket downward today and take P with it, I could close my puts before earnings this afternoon. I also may hold through earnings. I am short P. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

1966451,54342,2014-01-24T13:33:10-05:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP), a web 2.0 company that operates as a social networking and user review website by the same name, began its journey from a single city and continued that way for a year and a half to ensure quality and build-up of a platform operating across the globe with millions of user-access. Yelp is coordinating its services in countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Australia, Denmark, Turkey, New Zealand, Brazil and the Czech Republic. It also hosts an online database of user-generated reviews of local businesses, a city guide that taps into the community's voice and reveals true and current insights on local businesses and services on about everything under the sun. It had 100 million unique visitors in January 2013 with 4.6 million calls and 5.7 million directions generated through the Yelp mobile app.How It Earns?Yelp asks its users to write their personal reviews of businesses and engages them through social networking features like that of Facebook. Yelp users can not only search for and review businesses, simultaneously, it can create a profile, ""riend"" other users and chat in online forums.But the evident point is, which are the revenue sources for Yelp?Yelp spawns almost all of its revenue from advertising - 94% for the year 2012. There are primarily two kinds of advertising:The above chart depicts the revenue breakdown of Yelp from 2009 onwards.The major chunk of business reviews comes from shopping services (23%) and restaurant business (21%) followed by home and local services (11%).Yelping Via MobileYelp mobile app was launched in 2008, beginning with the iOS platform and later for Android and BlackBerry. With the help of Yelp mobile app, users can directly contribute their valuable reviews without any delay. Monocle, an augmented reality mode of Yelp, is quite dynamic in terms of usage. Similar to the Nokia City Lens, Monocle overlays ratings and other useful data for local businesses on a real-time basis. This can be done simply by manifesting the camera of your mobile device down the street, thereby becoming a very useful tool while trying to find a specific shop or eatery in an unknown place. The company reported in November 2012 that 45% of its web traffic came from mobile devices.Alarms Ringing HighSince its inception in 2004, Yelp has completed a long journey. From a local business review site based in San Francisco, it has transformed itself into a social networking site. But still it has not attained a completely stabilized phase and a lot needs to be improved further. The cost-benefit ratio is not balanced and this is the sole reason why Yelp has not been able to reap profits as yet. Even its mobile application has not been able to generate much profits because it is a tough task to monetize the mobile app space through miniature ad banners.The following is the chart showing revenue and profit margin for Yelp over the years:Another major concern for Yelp is the issue of ""Fake Reviews."" Several issues of fake reviews have been reported and Yelp has acknowledged them, filing law suits against many firms. In August 2013, Yelp sued a San Diego law firm for allegedly publishing fake reviews applauding its work. In June, the company sued AdBlaze in San Francisco federal court, accusing the online marketing firm of ""selling Yelp reviews from unknown accounts to unknown third parties furthermore.""However, Yelp has been ardently striving to altercate the cases of bogus reviews. Yelp uses sophisticated software to filter more than 42 million reviews contributed to find the most reliable and helpful ones. Those reviews that don't make the cut - which include the ones that the algorithm thinks might come from the businesses themselves - get filtered out.Survival Of The FittestYelp has been facing stiff competition from other sites such as Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), Foursquare, TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), Yellow Pages and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). But it has emerged as the dark horse with a constant revenue rise year after year. Yelp simply does a better job at gauging and responding to real-time, location-based user intent. Yelp users, for example, typically start searching for establishments when they are interested in a particular time and place. Yelp makes it easy for them to filter within specific categories and by personal preference. No matter the quality of its data, Foursquare's ""search and discovery"" recommendations will always have trouble competing with user-driven intent.Yelp conducted a study in July 2013 to show how much accurate the reviews are posted on its site, compared to its competitors and the results were definitely a plus point for Yelp.The results of the study is as follows:Entries that are significantly better than the other entries in a given row at a 95% confidence level are indicated in bold.In terms of listing data, Yelp and Google quite resemble each other and are much ahead of the other competitors. Google stands out on refining business websites but Yelp scores more than Google in terms of photo content.Investors Look For A Radiant FutureOne might say that Yelp is being overvalued for its current position in terms of profits and revenues. But it is the future outlook that the investors are bidding upon. At present, Yelp is undergoing a transformative phase in its business history. Yelp lost 1 cent per share on $55 million in the revenues generated for the second-quarter, well above what analysts were thinking. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were looking for a loss of 4 cents per share on $53.29 million in sales. The company is still not profitable on a non-GAAP basis, but it doesn't matter, as local ad growth continues to soar and the company is taking market share away from other providers, as well as the Yellow Pages, which has seemingly been in a decline for forever. Not only is the company seeing tremendous demand on mobile, with 40% of ads viewed on a mobile device and 59% of searches coming from mobile, Yelp is expanding into new markets.Therefore, looking on to the future prospects of Yelp, it can be suggested for investors who are ready to lock their capital for sometime in lieu of better returns. Yelp has a ""smart"" success story to convey.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Analysts at EurEx Consulting.

2064403,56262,2014-03-03T17:06:59-05:00,,"The growth story of Yelp (NYSE:YELP), an online urban city guide which helps people locate restaurants, has been impressive. The stock has appreciated nearly 310% in the last twelve months and is still the leading listing service for restaurant reviews. Yelp has grown its revenue consistently, but earnings have come to a standstill. The company posted a wider than expected loss (yet again) in the latest reported quarter, but investors have neglected that and have continued to bid up the stock due to its impressive revenue growth. However, I think Yelp's bull run is about to come to an end, which is why I think investors should short the stock. Let's take a look at the reasons why I think Yelp will plummet in the future.Google Will Dethrone YelpYelp has been spending lavishly in order to lure advertisers. Surging marketing expense has resulted in consistent double-digit revenue growth, but it is the primary reason why the company has never posted a profit. This strategy may backfire as the market is becoming increasingly crowded and Yelp will quite probably surrender market share to big name players like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).There are numerous reasons why I think Google+ Reviews can easily push Yelp aside and become the market leader. Let's go over the reasons one by one.The first reason is promotion by integration. Google is trying to make its search service a one-stop shop for users and has integrated Google+ Reviews across local Google searches and Google Maps, giving it a competitive edge over Yelp. 83% of searches were embedded with Google+ Reviews, which ultimately promoted the app in front of millions of users.The second reason why Google+ Reviews will cruise ahead of Yelp is customer satisfaction. New reports suggest that one out of every five review on Yelp is fake, which makes it difficult for the users to trust the assessment. Surpassing Yelp's review filter is pretty easy. Basically, if you set up multiple accounts and use them regularly, Yelp's review filter will not be able to know that the accounts are phony. Google on the other hand, can do a much better job in tracking fake accounts. Google can track activities on other apps like Google Maps, Gmail etc., which the majority of the people use, to differentiate real accounts from the ones which are counterfeit.In addition, Google has made it possible for users to get the menu of their preferred restaurants with a quick search. Users will be able to get the menu, price, and availability by typing or speaking ""show me the menu at [restaurant]"" from any of Google's search products. This spells trouble for Yelp, as users would find it easier to type in a search query rather than launching an app. As of now, this feature is only being rolled out in the U.S.A, and if Google is able to provide suitable answers to common restaurant queries, it will make visiting Yelp less necessary, if not unnecessary. All these factors together will result in a migration of users from Yelp to Google+ Reviews, thus hurting the former's future revenue and earnings.Valuation Too High To Be JustifiedAfter jumping over 300% year-over-year, Yelp is currently trading at 29 times sales. In addition, the company has a forward P/E ratio of 255, which is too high, especially when you consider the fact that its growth is slowing down. The company's revenue is expected to drop from 70% in 2013 to 52% in 2014. Though 52% growth is impressive, the inflated stock price has more than compensated for it. Moreover, insiders have decided to cash in on the current valuation, as four of the company's big name executives have sold their shares since Yelp crossed the $92 mark.ConclusionA short interest of over 21% indicates that a considerable proportion of investors have realized the fact that Yelp will struggle in the future. Yelp will not be returning to profitability in FY2014, and the company's stock price is too high to validate its present value. In addition, the company's growth is slowing down, and to make matters worse, it risks losing market share to Google at some point. With all these challenges ahead, Yelp is still hovering near its all-time high. Thus, it's highly likely that Yelp's shares will drop once it falls prey to Google, making it a good short candidate.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1994501,23625,2014-02-05T04:46:29-05:00,,"Yelp Inc. (NYSE:YELP) is set to report FQ4 2013 earnings after the market closes on Wednesday, February 5th. Yelp is one of the most well known apps for finding and rating restaurants and businesses. Analyst expectations for Yelp are high this quarter especially after Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) ripped the cover off the ball with its FQ4 2013 earnings report last week. Mobile advertising has been a large source of growth for Facebook, who have set a shining example of how to capitalize on the smartphone boom that has brought a secular tailwind to the social media mobile apps industry. Wall Street is expecting considerable year over year revenue growth from Yelp this quarter to the tune of 63%. Here's how investors expect Yelp to report this quarter.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see All Estimates for Yelp )The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for Yelp to report -2c EPS and $67.21M revenue while the current Estimize.com consensus from 15 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is -1c EPS and $67.89M revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting Yelp to beat the Street's expectations on both profit and revenue.Over the previous 6 quarters, the consensus from Estimize.com has been more accurate than Wall Street in predicting Yelp's revenue 5 times but has struggled with forecasting profit. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non professional investors, Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market's actual expectations. It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case we are seeing a smaller differential compared to recent quarters. The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from -7c to 1c EPS and $65.00M to $71.00M in revenues. This quarter we're seeing a moderate distribution of estimates compared to other quarters.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A larger distribution of estimates signaling less agreement in the market, which could mean greater volatility post earnings. Throughout the quarter the EPS consensus from Wall Street dropped from -1c to -2 while the Estimize.com forecast started and ended at -1c. Over the same period of time Wall Street has raised its revenue expectation from $64.34M to $67.21M, while the Estimize community elevated its consensus from $67.2M to $67.89M Timeliness is correlated with accuracy and at the end of the quarter we saw rising revenue expectations and falling profit forecasts.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is Slawson, who projects 0c EPS and $71.00M in revenue and self identifies as an independent financial research professional. In the Winter 2014 season Slawson is rated as the 491st best analyst and is ranked 551st overall among over 3,750 contributing analysts. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case Slawson is making a bullish call expecting Yelp to beat Wall Street's expectations on profit and revenue by a wide margin. Slawson is particularly bullish on Yelp's ability to generate revenue this quarter.This quarter, analysts on the Estimize.com platform are expecting Yelp to beat the Street's expectations on both profit and revenue. Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) also reports after the close Wednesday so investors will get a better picture of whether social media companies are up across the board or if the extreme growth is an isolated incident captured by Facebook.Disclosure: No positions"
1938231,25381,2014-01-10T05:19:50-05:00,,"When Yelp (NYSE:YELP) was trading for $50, everybody was talking about how overvalued the company is, how the growth expectations don't really match-up with the high valuation and how a lot of future success was built in the company even though it as unjustified. Fast forward several months and Yelp is now trading at $78, even though there have been no changes to the fundamental story. Yelp continues to be one of these stocks getting pumped up by hype alone.Currently Yelp has 70.3 million shares outstanding, which values the company at $5.5 billion. Each quarter, Yelp adds another 750,000 to 1 million shares to its total count due to stock based employee compensation and option awards getting exercised. As soon as the managers of the company are awarded new stock, they tend to drop their stock like a hot potato. For example, on December 30th, the CEO Jeremy Stoppelman exercised options to acquire 14,705 shares and he sold those shares on the very same day. If you look at all his trades in the last couple years, you'll realize that it is very rare that he holds Yelp stocks for more than one day. Whenever he's awarded new stock, he sells it pretty much immediately. They say that executives can sell shares for any reason and it shouldn't be a source of worry, which is something I agree with; however, it is fair to be concerned about the fact that the CEO of the company doesn't want to hold any shares of it and insider sales are increasing the dilution, making the company even more ridiculously overvalued.Lately some analysts have been pumping the stock up with ridiculous price targets like $90 and above. JPMorgan's Kaizad Gotla seems to think that Yelp is worth $89 per share, while Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group thinks that Yelp should trade for $95 per share. The ironic thing is that while analysts are continuing to increase their price targets, they are reducing their earnings estimates for the company. About 3 months ago, the average analyst saw Yelp earning 24 cents per share for the year of 2014, but now the average analyst sees it earning 19 cents per share. This is a reduction of 21%.As per revenue, analysts see Yelp generating $347.62M in 2014. Even the most optimistic analysts see the company generate $368.32M while more pessimistic estimates go as low as $329.16M. Considering how Yelp is expected to generate $229.62 million in 2013, the average estimate represents a growth rate of 51.39% whereas the most optimistic estimate represents a growth rate of 60.40% and the most pessimistic estimate represents a growth rate of 43.34%. Considering how Yelp's growth rate in 2013 was 67% and how it was 75% for the previous 3 years; we can see a slowdown in Yelp's growth even in the most optimistic estimates.Now there are two arguments Yelp bulls use to justify the company's ridiculously high valuation, which represents 415 times its forward earnings, 16 times its forward revenue and 28 times its book value. The first argument is that Yelp is expanding to more countries and that its growth will accelerate as a result of this expansion. Keep in mind that Yelp has failed to post a profit in its history even though it's been operating in the US, Canada and Western Europe where each visitor will bring far more revenue than in the rest of the world. For example, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) generates revenues of $4.85 per user in the US and Canada, compared to $1.96 in Europe, $0.81 in Asia and $0.67 in the rest of the world. Acquiring one member in the US is like acquiring 2.47 European members, 5.99 Asian members and 7.24 members from elsewhere in terms of revenues. If Yelp fails to make a profit on its American and Canadian users, how will it make a profit in the international markets where advertisement revenue is far less?The second argument Yelp bulls use is that one of the big players such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Facebook will make an offer to acquire Yelp at a premium. This doesn't make sense in more than one ways. First, there is no reason for Google, Apple or Facebook to acquire Yelp. These companies can always integrate Yelp's reviews in their system without buying Yelp. In fact, Apple's iOS and Google's search engine already utilize Yelp reviews in many ways. These companies won't buy Yelp for financial reasons either because Yelp represents a very tiny revenue or income growth for these players, especially compared to its hefty price. Besides, if there was a possibility of Yelp getting acquired by one of the big players, the management of the company would have been well-aware of that. Would the management be selling every share they are awarded almost immediately if they saw Yelp getting acquired by a big name? They wouldn't. This tells me that even Yelp's management doesn't put much faith in such an acquisition.Many analysts expect Yelp to grow into today's valuation in 10-15 years if everything goes perfectly. Here is the problem: when you are making projections that far ahead with very little certainty, you have to discount for the time value. For example, if a company is expected to grow to $20 billion of valuation in 10 years, we have to discount 10 years of appreciation from the company's current share value, because investors that put their money in a company today will be expecting to make money on their investment. Even if we expect Yelp's value to appreciate by 10% every year, it will reach a size of $14 billion in 10 years. If it's going to take Yelp 10-15 years to justify today's valuation of $5.5 billion; how long will it take it to grow into a size large enough to justify $14 billion in 10 years? If we discount for future appreciations and factor-in the ongoing dilution and slowing growth, it will take decades (if ever) before Yelp justifies today's valuation.At this point, shorting Yelp is also dangerous because this stock gets pumped up by the market on any news or even in the absence of news. Many stocks were pumped up to ridiculous levels during the dot.com bubble of the late 1990s but sooner or later, valuations catch up with reality. People usually give Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an example to justify high valuations of internet stocks; however, there are tens of examples that failed miserably for every Amazon. Companies like Amazon are not the rule, they are the exception.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1889961,23479,2013-12-10T16:26:49-05:00,,"In our previous note, we looked at the factors that will drive revenue growth at Yelp (NYSE:YELP). To recap, we are encouraged by the growth in Yelp’s business and have substantially increased our forecast for the number of active business accounts that Yelp can target, the number of unique visitors, as well as the revenues from deal businesses. Additionally, we believe that launch of advertising on a mobile platform will fuel the growth of the brand advertising division for the company as well. Despite the upgrade, our stock price estimate stands 30% below the current market price, which has more than tripled over the past year. In this article, we will discuss the factors that can negatively impact Yelp’s stock price in the future.Factors That Can Drag The Stock PriceOperating Expenses A Concern- The current market price implies a much higher growth than we presently forecast. However, the single most important factor that drives Yelp’s value after its revenue growth is the growth in its operating expenses. Yelp has had to incur high operating expenses to fuel its rapid expansion. Yelp’s operating expenses accounted for almost $170 million, 104% its overall revenues, in the first nine months of 2013. While the SG&A expense accounts for 76%, R&D expense accounts for 16% of the revenues. We expect SG&A costs to decline to around 43% of its revenue by the end of the forecast period. However, Yelp’s planned expansion spree can lead to an increase in SG&A expense as it will have to increase its marketing and operational costs to sustain the growth in new markets. If Yelp’s expenses were to increase by a lot more than what we currently expect, this would negatively impact the stock’s value meaningfully.Expansion Plans To Weigh on Average Revenue Per Active Business- Average revenue per active local business (ARPALB) is one of the most important drivers in our valuation for Yelp’s locals ads business. According to Yelp, monetization rate of a city or region increases with time. While ARPALB was at $3,800 for regions where Yelp started offering services in 2005, it was $950 for regions where Yelp services started in 2010. [1] As Yelp introduces its services in new regions, we expect that this trend will negatively impact average revenue. Additionally, as Yelp expands internationally, the average revenue will decline further as local businesses in these markets tend to spend less on ads compared to their counter parts in the U.S. We expect average revenue for Yelp to decline from $2,730 in 2012 to $2,550 by the end of our forecast period.Competition Can Challenge Yelp’s Growth- Our forecast is based on the assumption that Yelp will see reasonable success across its business lines and will be able to attract users in the new markets it enters. Although Yelp has first mover advantage in social local review services, other Internet giants can leverage their data, experience and money to launch similar services in the future. Companies such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Yahoo (YHOO) have competing services such as Google Places and Yahoo! Local. There’s always the risk that these companies can expand and leverage their existing base to compete with Yelp. If this were to materialize, Yelp’s revenue growth can slowdown. This could hurt the stock as the high price to sales-per-share ratio (a bit over 20x) suggests that the market is mainly pricing Yelps’s stock on high expected revenue growth. The P/E ratio is less meaningful as the company is only now generating positive EPS.Our price estimate for Yelp stands at $44.44, which is 30% below its current the market price. We invite the reader to adjust the model and create his or her own alternative valuation.Notes:Disclosure: No positions"
1938951,41821,2014-01-10T11:28:45-05:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) was one of the exciting names to hit the street during the beginning of the ""social media"" boom. Names like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI), Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), Pandora (NYSE:P), LinkedIn (LNKD), and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR) all followed suit. Most of these companies are ridiculously overvalued - and are companies that I've argued are the most susceptible to macro market pullbacks should the major markets retreat.Don't get me wrong, either - Yelp has been a cash machine for investors since its IPO. It's currently up over 250% in the last twelve months alone, and admittedly, I got stomped out the first time I tried to short Yelp in the 40's. But now, I'm back and I've got vengeance on my mind.Actually, I've got fundamentals on my mind. Let's just forget for the moment that Yelp is a $5 billion customer review website that has never made money. And, let's forget that current valuation pins onto the company that it must continue to grow at current rates for the next 12-14 years. Let's just take a quick fundamental look at five fundamental reasons to short Yelp.1. Yelp Has a Forward P/E of 294Nuff said.No, but seriously, Yelp is part of a fraternity of social media stocks that have enormously inflated P/E ratios, despite either not being profitable or having lofty growth goals that need to be met over the coming years.There's been some arguments for the fact that the social media bubble is deflating, based on venture capitalists investing less in these companies of recent. With the addition of Twitter, the social media bubble is still very much in play, and Yelp is heading it up.2. Yelp's Outstanding Shares are Growing ConsistentlyYelp's outstanding share count now sits at over 66 million, due to compensation in shares which insiders usually dump on the open market as soon as they receive it. At today's market cap of $5.28 billion with a price of $79.89 - if Yelp continues to grow its outstanding shares at this rate, the same market cap would command a price of $75.33 just one year from now. That type of dilution clipping the share prices takes its toll after a few quarters. And, by no means does Yelp deserve to command a $5 billion market cap in the first place.YELP Shares Outstanding data by YCharts3. Google Reviews is Likely to Outdo Yelp EventuallyThe same that Apple is going to outdo Pandora is the same way that Google is going to outdo Yelp. It's just a matter of time.A large portion of the long case is that a company like Google could eventually make a bid for Yelp - but the question would be, why? With Google Reviews already in place and already the first thing that a potential user sees when Googling places like restaurants, why wouldn't Google just capitalize on the infrastructure they already have in place?What would be the point of buying out such a demonstrably overvalued company?4. Yelp's Price to Book Value Is Through the RoofAgain, yet another fundamental indicator that screams overvalued. Yelp is trading at 28 times what it's worth on paper. That would be like the stock for a dollar menu fries at McDonald's trading on an exchange for $28 - it just doesn't make sense.YELP Price to Book Value data by YChartsConclusionHowever, with Yelp the one caveat remains in whether or not the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. With a momentum stock like Yelp that moves without rhyme or reason, one has to be extremely cautious and diligent when entering a short position. You could do well to insure a short on the equity with some calls, or simply to have a stop-loss in place. This is a stock that has traded 20% in a day on news of shares being unlocked.As always, I wish all investors the best of luck going forward.Disclosure: I am short YELP, .

1854491,22148,2013-11-21T09:19:40-05:00,,"After reviewing the top gainers in the S&P 500 since March 9, 2009 provided by Bespoke Investment Group, one stock really stuck out. Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) generated one of the largest gains at nearly 1,000% during that period. What really stood out is that Chipotle unlike other stocks on the list was considered a high quality company all along yet it presented several extreme-buying opportunities over those years.Using that same general concept of buying quality stocks on dips, a couple of top performing companies with huge opportunities really stick out. Both Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) have very desirable, market leading models. The issue is that the stocks trade at high multiples that make the stocks difficult to purchase at the current levels. Following the Chipotle example, the market will provide several opportunities in the future to buy these stocks at lower multiples. The key is whether investors are prepared and ready to pounce when it occurs.Chipotle ExampleThe Bespoke list includes stocks in the S&P 1500 that soared over 1,000% during that time period. The problem with this list is that the majority of the stocks were difficult to predict that huge gains were ahead. In the cast of the S&P 500 list, a few stocks including Chipotle probably could've been predicted to have a strong future.Chipotle went public back in 2006 after being spun off from McDonald's (NYSE:MCD). The stock surged over the next couple of years to reach over $150, but the financial collapse at the end of 2008 caused the stock to collapse. As the chart below shows, the stock surged over the next couple of years to reach over $440, yet not long after that fears about competition from the low end Mexican food providers in the form of Taco Bell sent the stock plunging below $250. That situation provided another extreme buying opportunity with the stock surging to over $500 within a year.CMG data by YChartsAll the while, investors claimed issues with high valuations and concerns about future growth. Analysts continue to expect long-term earnings growth of 21% and the stock trades at a forward PE of over 40. Clearly the stock trades at a maximum valuation even after all these years.The major point to apply to these other stocks is that an investor buying at $150 in late 2007 has a very different perspective and account balance than the one buying near the low in mid-2008. The 1,000% gain quickly dissapates into less than a 300% gain during a longer time period.Business AngleBoth Yelp and Zillow have the business angle similar to a Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) as opposed to a social network. Consumers flock to the services in order to find their dream house or locate a great restaurant in the area. In both cases, the service isn't based on a social connection that may disappear in the future. It's all based on whether Yelp or Zillow provides the best option for obtaining the service desired by the customer.Yelp has the potential of becoming the new Yellow Pages and the provider of the best content on local businesses. The stock has surged to a market value of over $4 billion with expectations of revenue surging over 50% to $346 million next year.Zillow has the opportunity to be the dominant player in the online real estate marketplace. Home buyers looking for a house, mortgage, or real estate agent could flock to the associated websites. With a valuation just below $3 billion and revenue expected to be shy of $300 million next year, the stock trades at a high multiple, but revenue growth of 44% next year probably justifies it.Chart - revenue growthYELP Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YChartsConclusionIn my opinion, the question isn't whether these stocks eventually reach valuations of $10 billion or even $20 billion, but whether investors can obtain the stocks at much lower valuations during periods of weakness along that path. The Chipotle Mexican Grill example suggests that periods of extreme weakness will occur in the future. Remember that Chipotle was one of the best performing stocks in the last few years, yet it had a couple of periods of roughly 50% declines. The smart investor will take advantage when it occurs to Yelp and Zillow and greatly enhance investor returns.Ultimately this theory applies to any high quality stocks, the key being that investors must do research prior to a collapse to identify the quality stocks. Finally when the major selloff occurs it shoiuld be relished and pounced on in order to achieve these outsized gains.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1881961,25381,2013-12-06T08:16:30-05:00,,"After reaching an all-time high of $75.37, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) experienced a correction where the share price fell by 23% to $58.15, but since then, the share price bounced up to low $60s. Now it's still down 16% from its October high and the company is still madly overvalued. Analysts continue to pump Yelp based on empty hype and investors continue to buy the shares even though there is no justification for it. Yelp is one of the biggest reminders of 1999's dotcom bubble and those things never end well.Analysts currently have a price target of $70 on Yelp and some analysts' targets go as high as $85. Of the 26 analysts covering the stock, 13 rate it as either ""strong buy"" or ""buy"" and 13 rate it as ""hold"" with no ""sell ratings"" despite its ridiculous valuation.Here is the funny thing though, even those analysts who give Yelp sky-high targets don't believe in the company's success anytime soon. These same analysts expect Yelp to post a loss of 14 cents per share this year, followed by a net profit of 19 cents per share in 2014. The analyst estimates for the fiscal year 2014 range from 2 cents of profit to 44 cents of profit. In fact, just 3 months ago, the average analyst estimate for 2014 was actually 24 cents as opposed to the 19 cents today. The analysts have cut down their expectations considerably in the last few months from Yelp's earnings estimates, yet they didn't cut their price targets at all. Now, keep in mind that Yelp has never posted a profit in its history and it is doubtful whether the company will ever become profitable. At the average analyst estimate, Yelp is currently trading for 336 times its 2014 earnings, and even by the most optimistic estimate, the company is trading for 145 times its 2014 earnings.The story doesn't end here either. Even these analysts who believe so much in Yelp see the company's growth rate slowing down considerably in the next few years. For example, in 2010, Yelp generated $47.73 million in revenues, up 85% from 2009's $25.81. In the following year, the company increased its revenues to $83.28 million, up 74% from the previous year. The growth rate had already slowed down from 85% to 74%. In 2012, Yelp's growth rate slowed further to 65% as it increased its revenues from $83.28 million to $136.50 million. According to the same analysts who continue to give Yelp sky-high valuations, Yelp is looking at a growth rate of 57% this year and an average of 40% in the next 5 years.So, the analysts see Yelp's growth slowing down for the foreseeable future, they don't think it will be that profitable anytime soon, yet, they continue to give Yelp ridiculously high price targets. Why won't an analyst drop his target price estimate when he drops his future earnings estimate for the company? This makes no sense and shows me that the analysts aren't basing their earnings estimates on any fundamentals, but more on empty hype.Now, I can hear you thinking that Yelp will still grow at a relatively fast rate (40% in revenues until that gets downgraded too) so it deserves a higher P/E than the market average. I agree that we can't give Yelp a P/E value of 10-15 when it continues to grow in double digits. On the other hand, the company isn't growing fast enough to warrant a forward P/E of 300+ either.According to analysts, Yelp is expected to generate $346 million in revenues in 2014 and grow its revenues by an average of 40% for the next 5 years as I've mentioned above. This gives us a revenue estimate of $485 million in 2015, $679 million in 2016, $951 million in 2017, $1.33 billion in 2018 and $1.86 billion in 2019. The analysts also expect Yelp to grow its earnings by 40% even though the company has never been profitable in its history and has always been enjoying negative margins. So, if Yelp can earn 19 cents per share and grow it at a rate of 40% each year for the next 5 years, it will look at net profit of 27 cents in 2015, 37 cents in 2016, 52 cents in 2017, 73 cents in 2018 and $1.02 in 2019. So, even after 5 years of very optimistic growth estimates which may or may not come true, Yelp will be looking at a forward price to revenue ratio of 2.24 and a forward price to earnings ratio of 60. This also assumes that Yelp's price will stay flat for the next 5 years though. When investors put their money in companies, they expect their value to appreciate because that's the whole point of investing. If we assume an annual discount rate of 15% for Yelp (which is pretty conservative considering how volatile this stock is), the company's price to revenue ratio increases to 4.50 and its price to earnings ratio increases to 121 for 2019. This is ridiculously high.The calculation above doesn't even keep dilutions into account. For Yelp, dilution has always been part of equation even though most analysts choose to ignore it. Just four quarters ago, Yelp had 62.22 million outstanding shares; today the company has 69.70 million outstanding shares. Just two months ago, Yelp issued 3.7 million shares to raise additional capital (because it's not profitable and selling shares is the only way for Yelp to generate cash flow at the moment). Furthermore, the company keeps issuing new shares to pay its employees so it adds about a million shares per year to its outstanding share number for this purpose alone.For example, the company's CEO Jeremy Stoppelman holds hardly any shares of the company because he keeps selling shares periodically. Every time he's awarded new shares, he gets rid of them quickly. You can see his recent transactions in this link. While I don't always believe that insider sales constitute a problem, this may become a problem with Yelp's case. They say that an insider can sell shares for any reason, which is true. For many insiders, selling shares is a way to supplement their income and pay for their living expenses. This is perfectly fine and I am not going to look at the reasons why Yelp insiders keep dumping shares in the market. What I am more concerned about is the fact that each insider sale will increase dilution and if we go at this rate, dilution will eat much of Yelp's future growth even in the absence of future secondary offerings.I just don't know how analysts come to price targets like 70% when even their optimist estimates see the company's growth slowing down and there is too much uncertainty about the company's future profitability. Yelp isn't profitable, it is not growing fast enough to justify its high valuation, insiders keep selling, dilution keeps increasing, and once someone starts discounting future share appreciation, it is so easy to see that Yelp is overvalued by at least 50% even after its correction. Does that mean Yelp will fall by 50%? It probably won't happen soon because the market dynamics (fueled by the Fed's printing activities) will continue to support this bubble for a while. They say that the market can remain irrational longer than many of us can remain solvent. This is why I am long both puts and calls of the company as an insurance policy, just in case things don't go my way.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1859381,20411,2013-11-24T01:50:20-05:00,,"By Neal RauAs Yelp (NYSE:YELP) works towards profitability, the stock has performed very well for investors, as it has returned 215% YTD, but shares have recently declined after an earnings miss at the end of October. This happened even though local business reviews are more popular than ever, and Yelp's mobile app continues to be the most popular tool for consumers on the go. Momentum stocks like YELP have made investors a lot of money this year, as every dip has been a buying opportunity, so is this a buying opportunity for YELP?Along with earnings, YELP announced a registered public offering of approximately $250 million shares and that is dilutive to current shareholders. The company will use the net proceeds of the offering for additional working capital and general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing activities, general and administrative matters and capital expenditures. In addition, Yelp may use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement its business. Given the pullback, based on the real-time trading report published by Stock Traders Daily, the stock is moving closer to a test of longer-term support, but it is not there yet; this article discusses our strategy, based on this report.Yelp is making great progress with its local business, but competition is also growing. Google is still playing catch up, but it is working its recently acquired Zagat, into Google maps. This allows customers to search for local businesses and rate those using Google maps and is a concern for Yelp because Google drives about half of its website traffic. Yelp is going to need to encourage non-app users to find its reviews in a more direct path. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), who also offers reviews, has more than 18 million local businesses and counting. Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) and Yahoo! (NASDAQ:YHOO) maps are also looking to take their share of the local business revenues.Right now about two-thirds of internet users choose Google Maps for their mapping needs, even in mobile and tablet markets, Google Maps continues to be dominant. Google Maps is not only the most popular mapping app, but it is also one of the most popular apps period. Right now, Google Maps is used in 46% of all mobile devices.A big positive for Yelp however is the fact that the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) mapping application utilizes Yelp reviews when someone searches for a local business using it. The issues surrounding Apple Maps recently hurt yelp but after numerous changes and feature updates for Apple Maps, they have significantly improved the user experience. The total number of iPhones and Android phones in the US has grown to 136 million and the number who used the Google Maps app has been dropping, down to 58 million, while the number of Apple Maps users stands at 35 million out of a total iPhone population of 60.1 million. As Apple Maps' users continue to increase, Yelp should continue to benefit.YELP is a stock traders love, but as a trader we must pay close attention to price because that matters most. If we time the trade correctly we can make lots of money, and that is what our real time trading report for YELP is designed to help traders do. Based on the Stock Traders Daily real-time trading report for YELP, the stock has been drifting closer to long-term support, but isn't there yet (be patient). If the stock continues to move lower and tests long-term support we would be buyers near support. For casual observers, that means we are anticipating slightly lowers levels before we would consider buying YELP, and then we would use the support level that triggers the buy signal as our risk control as well just in case the trades begins to move against us.About us: Stock Traders Daily has been providing comprehensive market analysis, and correlated trading strategies since January 2000, which was the virtual peak of the Internet Bubble.

1828022,25258,2013-11-11T05:59:09-05:00,,"Internet stocks continue to garnish much attention as witnessed by market's latest obsession on the IPO of Twitter (TWTR). Companies whose products are used by the masses tend to have a halo effect when it comes to their popularity. For the online local business review company, Yelp (YELP), such popularity was marked with an impressive upward momentum on the stock market. Yet over the last two months, the company appears to have struggled in continuing its prior rate of climb. As seen in the chart below, the share price failed to retrace its prior market high. Of greater significance, the company's stock most recently dipped below the level of support that it had been forming.Revenue Growth And Marketing Expense GrowthAs for the company itself, one of the key drivers to Yelp's public market success has been it's rapidly growing revenue. Over the past three years, Yelp has sequentially increased its revenue from $47.7 million in 2010, to $83.3 million in 2011, and ultimately to $137.6 million in 2012. However, such revenue growth has also resulted in increasing operating losses. In 2010, Yelp had an operating loss of $9.5 million. In 2011, the loss grew to $16.2 million. In 2012, this loss expanded further to $18.7 million.The largest culprit to this outcome lies Yelp's rapidly growing marketing expense. Selling, general and administrative expenses have rapidly climbed along with Yelp's rising revenue. In 2010, this expense was $45.2 million. By 2012, it was over $117.4 million. In the company's Q3 2013 earnings call found here, CFO Robert Krolik had the following to say about this growing expense category:Overall, it remains a positive indicator that marketing expense growth continues to fall. However, investors should be on guard that there was a mere 3% differential in marketing expense growth when compared to actual revenue growth. Such a high correlation and slow divergence between the two factors suggests that profitability will take a significant amount of time before becomes a more normal occurrence. Of course, this assumes that Yelp's revenue growth can be sustained long enough to even bring about such profitability into consideration.YELP data by YChartsInsiders Selling OutThe one steady trend that has continued in the background of Yelp's public life on the market is the consistent sale of stock by insiders. Much of these sales are derived from exercised stock options. The largest insider sellers of Yelp include CEO Jeremy Stoppelman, General Counsel Laurence Wilson, Director Max Levchin, Senior VP Joseph Nachman, and COO Geoffrey Donaker. In October alone, these insiders sold stock with a combined total value of $16,564,916.However, the most interesting aspect of these insiders is that they none of them are willing to hold onto any shares. Upon exercising there options every month, each of them have maintained a zero-balance after the subsequent sale. An example of this can be seen in the latest Form 4 found here filed by CEO Jeremy Stoppelman. Such apparent overall lack of confidence in the company's future potential could suggest that the company's valuation has merely exceeded its near-term potential.YELP data by YChartsRaising Capital With A Follow-On OfferingOn November 5, Yelp announced the closing of its latest capital raise found in a follow-on offering of company stock. An aggregate 4,312,500 shares were sold at a price of $67 per share. The total amount raise was approximately $288.9 million. The net affect resulted in minimal dilution to the company's existing 66.1 million shares outstanding. However, the capital raise could further establish the upper limit of Yelp's current price range. It may also serve in slowing the company's upward momentum.A Look At The FinancialsBased on approximately 70 million shares outstanding, Yelp now trades with a market capitalization of $4.4 billion based on the last closing price of $63.38 as of November 8. Excluding the company's latest capital raise, Yelp carries a very high price-to-book ratio of 20.77 and price-to-sales ratio of 20.08.The company's latest offering should considerably improve Yelp's balance sheet. As of September 2013, Yelp had total assets of $224.3 million. It maintains a very under-leveraged balance sheet with only $27.9 million in total liabilities. Nevertheless, it remains highly speculative as to when the company will be able to turn net income positive. Current analyst estimates predict that Yelp will earn $0.19 by the end of 2014. This gives the company a considerably high forward price-to-earnings ratio of 333.Final ThoughtsYelp continues to grow its revenue fairly well. However, investor expectations for the company have rapidly surpassed the growth rate of that revenue. The company's need to drive revenue growth has necessitated significant increases in marketing expenses. It remains yet to be seen if the company will be able to sustain that same rate of acceleration once this growing expense is diminished. The same applies to whether Yelp will be able to achieve and retain its future profitability.At the same time, while investors may continue to eagerly support the company's share price, management has taken advantage of this opportunity. Numerous insiders have sold out of their positions in the company entirely. Likewise, management has bolstered Yelp's balance sheet with an additional follow-on offering. Such capital could prove to be useful should the company pursue acquisitions or have need to sustain its ongoing operations further down the road.Disclosure: I am short YELP.

1833842,25381,2013-11-12T16:36:07-05:00,,"Recently, Yelp's (NYSE:YELP) CEO Jeremy Stoppelman was on Reddit.com, answering questions from investors and consumers of the website. The conversation was very interesting because the users of the website were able to ask questions anonymously (without giving their real names) which means they could ask any question they wanted without fearing repercussions, unlike the analysts who usually have to sugarcoat their questions so that the company's management won't get upset with them (most analysts need company management to feed them with insider information in order to create their models for predicting future price of a company; therefore, they have to have good relations with management of companies, which means they can't ask some difficult questions openly).So, what did people ask Mr. Stoppelman during his Reddit session? In this article, I will present some of the questions that were directed to Mr. Stoppelman, his answers to those questions and my take on his answers.One user asked Mr. Stoppelman what he thinks about the ""extortion"" claims. According to the claims, Yelp filters out positive reviews of small businesses that don't want to buy advertisement from it. In fact, several small business owners chimed in and added their own experiences with Yelp in the discussion, which seemed to support the whole extortion thesis. One individual wrote: ""I told the Yelp sales rep to get lost and to stop calling me after about 6 months of hounding. He finally relented... but guess what, ALL of my positive reviews are now filtered. Up until that conversation, only about 25% of my reviews were filtered. Now every single one is filtered. Yelp holds my real clients' reviews hostage because I refuse to pay their extortion fees. It is rather infuriating."" Another individual shared the same sentiment: ""I sat in on a sales call with a Yelp rep, and after questioning her on the finer details, we decided Yelp wasn't for us and we told her so. She then became noticeably irritated and said ""good luck getting any positive reviews in the future."" A third commenter also shares her experience: ""It's true. My family member owns a business and was approached by Yelp to pay or else only negative reviews would be publicly visible.""Yelp's CEO responded to these claims by saying: ""Despite the 'Yelp extorts' conspiracy meme, there's never been a shred of actual 'smoking gun' evidence (phone call recording, email, etc.) to back up the claims."" Basically, Mr. Stoppelman claimed that those people were being dishonest. This comment received a total of negative 30 votes from the users, which means that most people didn't find the answer satisfactory.Mr. Stoppelman also claimed that it was impossible to get Yelp to manipulate reviews. He said: ""There has never been any amount of money you could pay us to manipulate reviews. We do have an algorithm that highlights the most useful and reliable reviews on our site which is about 75% of contributed content. I started Yelp to solve my own need of finding a great doctor, obviously we needed to protect consumers against fake reviews and spam to make sure the site is actually helpful (anyone remember CitySearch?). That's why we pioneered the development of a review filter, a technology that other competitors like Google have since tried to mimic."" This is interesting because Mr. Stoppelman acknowledged that 25% of Yelp's reviews were filtered by the system as ""fake"" or ""unreliable"" which means that Yelp itself doesn't trust every fourth review written on the website. If the number of fake or unreliable reviews on Yelp is so high, how can the algorithm reliably identify the bad reviews from good reviews? If every fourth review is filtered out by the system, there is a lot of room for error where thousands of good reviews would get filtered and thousands of bad reviews would be kept in. There is absolutely no way for an algorithm to tell whether a review is good or not by simply looking at keywords (and Yelp keeps its algorithm as a secret, which raises suspicions even further).When asked whether Yelp has been audited by a third party, Mr. Stoppelman showed a link of a Google search which demonstrates how a lot of small businesses that advertise on Yelp still receive negative reviews from people, to prove that those companies don't get preferential treatment from Yelp.Yelp's CEO also shared an academic study titled: ""Fake It Till You Make It: Reputation, Competition, and Yelp Review Fraud."" This study found that there was no relationship between whether a small business chooses to advertise on Yelp and their average review scores. In other words, whether being a Yelp advertiser or not did not predict whether a small business would receive favorable scores or not. The academicians conducting the study argued that the results should be interpreted with caution because it was only able to look at whether a company was advertising on Yelp at the time of data collection and they didn't have access to historical data, the study was limited to one geographical area (Boston), and the study could only look at the current reviews but not any reviews that might have been deleted by the users.Later in the discussion, A former sales person at Yelp chimed in the discussion in support of Mr. Stoppelman: ""As a former salesperson for Yelp (I don't think this violates my NDA), we were all told repeatedly that we would be fired for that. Really, it just creates a frustrated customer that will cancel on us if we suggested there was something we could do when in fact we could not. The biggest frustration from the sales side was people wanting to pay (or at least offering to pay) to remove negative reviews and us fighting to explain why we couldn't. According to every business owner, all negative reviews are completely unjustified and no one ever has an actual bad experience with them so we shouldn't be giving a platform for complaining about bad service which doesn't exist. Sales pitches can be recorded, though not always. I personally saw someone fired when they were caught getting good reviews onto pages of businesses they signed up. The algorithm was pretty good at detecting aberrant behavior in reviews.""Despite this, a large number of small business owners continued to claim that their positive reviews would disappear and negative reviews would increase in numbers soon after they were approached by a Yelp sales person and refused to buy advertisement spots from the website. Could all these people by lying? Could the company's management be lying? Could both sides be right, or both sides be wrong at the same time? Perhaps, there are some ""bad apples"" in Yelp's sales department and these people are causing all the trouble while Yelp's management has nothing but good intentions. In fact, this was also asked during the Reddit session. Mr. Stoppelman's response was: """"rogue salespeople"" acting in their own interests against Yelp's training and policies could, in theory, promise a potential client anything - but they have no way of fulfilling that promise. We haven't built a product that allows businesses to remove negative reviews and a ""duped"" advertiser would obviously realize that right away and let us know. We have 57,000 paying advertisers who know what they get and that's not it.""This response got my curious and I decided to check on Yelp's reviews on Glassdoor. For those who don't know, Glassdoor is like Yelp of employment. This is a website where current and former employees rate their places of employment. I was interested to see if there would be some people who claimed that they would be conducting unethical things while making a sales call. I noticed a few reviews saying that Yelp is a high-pressure environment where there is a strong pressure to sell as much as possible as quickly as possible, and those who don't meet the aggressive sales goals are being let go quickly. One review reads (cleaned up for grammar and clarity): ""I wasn't given a chance and I was abruptly let go without being able to prove myself. I was given a crappy sales territory, and they had very high expectations for the territory that I don't think anyone could meet. My boss wanted me to do unethical things in order to get sales. There was so much pressure. I was working 12 hour days and I was still let go.""There were several other questions ranging from what Mr. Stoppelman ate for breakfast to what he thinks of sugar. Surprisingly, he answered every one of these questions with one exception: when he was asked about why Yelp's management has been selling their shares without buying, he left that question unanswered. In fact, several people asked the same question but received no response. This was the only topic Mr. Stoppelman didn't want to touch.Another note, if you search Yelp on Yelp, you surprisingly find a lot of negative reviews, which can't be too good for the company's future growth prospects. Yelp can't afford people leaving its website. Currently, Yelpers rate Yelp as 3 out of 5 and if we sort the reviews by date, we find that 7 out of the last 10 reviews gave the website 1 out of 5, and many of them claimed that their small business was victimized by Yelp.So what are some take-home lessons from Mr. Stoppelman's Reddit session? First, we found out that there are many people who claim that Yelp is trying to extort money from small businesses and the company seriously needs to do something in order to change such public perception. Second, we found out that there is a study supporting Yelp's claim that there is no relationship between whether a small business advertises on Yelp and whether the small business gets good reviews. Third, we found out that Yelp's management will continue to be quiet about insider stock sales. At least this Reddit session asked a lot of questions that analysts would never consider asking, which provided us with some more insight regarding Yelp.Currently Yelp is a very expensive stock and it's priced for perfection. Much of Yelp's high valuation stems from high hopes and it is definitely getting supported by the Fed's money-printing appetite. As long as the Fed provides the market with free money to gamble with, hype stocks will continue to be strong. I would be careful in the long term because this stock (along with many other hyped up stocks) could easily crash if the Fed decides to get more conservative with its money policy. As Yelp currently trades for 21 times its book value, 20 times its sales and 294 times its cash value, the company will have to grow by about 2000% just to justify its current price, let alone any future appreciations. At the current price, Yelp is definitely a risky bet.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1784422,25381,2013-10-29T17:33:39-04:00,,"On Tuesday in the after-hours, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) announced results of another quarter where it failed to report a profit. The company reported a loss of 4 cents per share on revenues of $61.2 million (this represents a year-to-year growth of 68%). Yelp has a habit of spending more money than it makes and this habit might continue on for the foreseeable future.Let's review the company's latest results first. Yelp's cumulative reviews grew by 42% in the last four quarters and the company's average monthly unique visitors grew by another 41%. Currently Yelp enjoys 47.3 million reviews and 117 million monthly unique visitors. There are currently 57,200 local business accounts on Yelp, which represents a 61% growth over the last four quarters. These are all good, right? Well, actually these are not that good if they don't turn into profits and this is exactly what we are seeing with Yelp. While the company continues to grow its user base, it spends more money than it generates in order to accomplish this.Here is the funny thing: in its earnings presentation, Yelp only had 5 slides and none of the slides contained any information on the profitability of the company. All the comparisons were year-to-year and there was nothing on quarter-to-quarter growth rates. Yelp only provided the investors with the metrics where it looks strong, while those who wanted more details on the company's earnings had to dig deeper to find the actual numbers.When we dig deeper into Yelp's numbers, we realize that in order to generate $61.2 million in revenues, the company had to spend $34.12 million on sales and marketing, $11.21 million on product development, $10.54 million on general administrative functions and $4.27 on other costs of revenue. Basically, generating $61.2 million in revenues costs Yelp $60.14 million (it totals up to $62.96 million if we include depreciation and amortization items). Similarly, year-to-date, Yelp spent $169 million in order to generate $162 million in revenues. Between the third quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of this year, Yelp's revenues grew by 68% while the company's operating costs jumped by 64%. This excludes the stock based compensation, which grew from $2.33 million to $7.10 million during the same period.When we look at Yelp's balance sheet, we see that the company generated only $6 million in free cash flow year-to-date, which compares very weakly with the company's current market value of $4.5 billion. In fact, during this period, the company even diluted its share count from 61.26 million to 65.53 million. Furthermore, if we exclude the $9.33 million received by the company from its sale of additional common stock, it would have been cash flow negative for the year of 2013.To make the matters worse, Yelp just announced that it would sell more shares in order to fund its operations. The company will be looking to raise $250 million, which will dilute the current shareholders and make each share even more overvalued. Perhaps, moving forward, selling more shares will be just part of Yelp's business plan. After all, this seems to be the only way the company can generate positive cash flow.Now, let's take a look at the numbers Yelp didn't mention to us either in its report or during its presentation, quarter to quarter comparisons. Yelp only provided comparisons between the third quarter of 2012 and the third quarter of 2013 so that the company's growth looks more impressive. Many investors will be wondering how much growth Yelp saw since the last quarter and they will have to look at last quarter's announcement to find these numbers.So, in the second quarter of the year, Yelp generated $55 million in revenues, enjoyed 42.5 million cumulative reviews, 108 million average monthly unique visitors and 51,400 active local business accounts. Now Yelp's growth rate doesn't look that impressive anymore. The company's quarter-to-quarter revenue growth is 10.9%, cumulative review growth is 11.29%, active local business account growth is 11.27% and average monthly unique visitor growth is 8.3%. By showing only year-to-year comparisons, Yelp was able to hide its slowing growth rates.Companies like Yelp make me feel like we are back to year 1999. It looks like the investors haven't learned their lessons even though many of them lost everything they had when the tech-bubble collapsed. Why would investors value a company like Yelp at $4.5 billion which is 20 times its annual revenues? We can't even do a P/E or price-to-cash flow comparison because the company has never been profitable in its history.Do I recommend shorting the stock then? Actually shorting a bubble stock is just as crazy of an idea as buying it. Investors that are looking to short this stock would be well-served by protecting their short position by coupling it with buying calls or selling puts. Then again, bubbles can last longer than many investors can stay afloat. Staying away from stocks like this seems to be the best idea at this time.Apart from valuation, there are also other concerns surrounding Yelp. For example, many small business owners see Yelp as a ""mafia"" that ""extracts money from them in order to protect their reputation."" Regardless of whether it is true or not, Yelp needs to develop better relationship with small business owners if it wants to be profitable. After all, their biggest sources of revenue are small business owners, and any company that makes its customers mad won't stay in business for long.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1761182,20568,2013-10-22T15:01:00-04:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) has been getting a series of good reviews from Wall Street. Those good reviews come in the form of higher earnings estimates and that has helped make the stock the Bull of the Day as a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Steady Increases In RevenueOne critical factor in a stock beating earnings is to have strong topline growth. YELP has been able to produce consistent beats on top and that has translated into a recent beat on the bottom line as well.The last three quarters saw the company hit positive revenue surprises of 2.2%, 3.4% and 3.2% respectively. The most recent quarter also saw a bottom line surprise of 75% as the company came in three cents ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Company DescriptionYelp operates an online urban city guide that helps people find places to eat, shop, drink, relax, and play based on the informed opinions of a community of locals in the know. It offers information relating to restaurants, shopping, food, nightlife, arts and entertainment. The company serves customers in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Spain, Italy, Switzerland, Finland, and Belgium. Yelp was founded in 2004 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California.Earnings HistoryOf the last five reports, the company has posted two earnings beats, two misses and reported in line one time. That isn't exactly a stellar record, but as the company moves towards profitability, investors would be wise to take a deeper look at the stock.While they are in quite different industries, Telsa (NASDAQ:TSLA) saw its stock jolt higher as it reached its expected first quarter of profitability. The move higher in the automaker was also assisted by a very large short position in the stock. YELP has seen the number of shares sold short increase from 4.7M at the end of June to 6.6M at the end of July and 7.5M at the end of September. So there is potential for a very large short squeeze should the company reach profitability sooner than expected.The Next Earnings ReportThe company is expected to report earnings on October 29 after the market closes. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for $59M in revenue and a loss of a penny per share. Given that the last quarter was expected to see a loss of four cents a share and the company reported a loss of only one cent a share, this could very well be the quarter that helps push shares higher.Each of the last two quarterly reports helped the stock move higher. The March 2013 report was a miss on the bottom line of two cents, but the beat on top was more to Wall Street's liking. The stock moved higher by 23.8% in the session following the report. Similarly, the June 2013 quarter saw a move of 23.2% after beating on both the top and bottom lines.Earnings Estimates Moving HigherIn May the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2013 was calling for a loss of $0.14 per share. That number ticked higher to a loss of $0.13 per share in July and then to loss of $0.10 per share where the consensus resides today.Over the same time period the earnings estimates for 2014 have increased from a gain of $0.19 in May to a gain of $0.23 where the consensus sits right now.ValuationThe more common metric investors lean on (PE) is not relevant for YELP as the company still has negative trailing and forward earnings. That will change soon as the calendar year 2014 is expected to be profitable. Price to book and price to sales metrics are more relevant, but they show some inflated numbers as investors still struggle to properly value the company that has negative earnings and tremendous growth. Speaking of growth, this should be the focus of most valuation arguments. The company is expected grow revenues 46% in 2014 compared to 7.3% for the industry average. Earnings growth is even better, with 332% growth in 2014 vs. the 14% industry average.The ChartA quick look at the chart shows a stock that is moving higher in a rapid fashion. With earnings right around the corner and potential profitability there to push the stock higher, there could be a massive short squeeze. Average daily volume of 3.4M shares means that there is a little over two days volume of stock that is sold short. Of course earnings days tend to get more liquid than most, but don't be surprised if a sizable amount of short covering pushes this stock higher into the earnings report."
1715372,34541,2013-09-26T14:04:21-04:00,,"Insider selling in Yelp (NYSE:YELP) was identified as a concern in a recent SeekingAlpha.com article. In the comment section it was put forward by an apparent Yelp skeptic that these executives could stop the automatic selling in their 10b5-1 trading plans if they really felt the stock is undervalued. In reply, a Yelp defender pointed out that it is ""very typical, insider selling at this point... People sell for all kinds of reasons, buying a house, sending kids to college, taking deserved profit to diversify holdings.""Indeed one can say there has been significant selling in Yelp but only by the dollar figure relative to the average American's net worth. Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman sold 58,824 shares August 26 - September 16, pursuant to a 10b5-1 trading plan. That sounds like a large number depending on how one spins it. When you consider that Stoppelman currently controls 4,895,096 shares, the gravity of the sales diminishes somewhat.Such selling is not so unusual for a company at this stage after an IPO.Right from the beginning, venture capital firms and founders invariably make their initial rounds of investment with a ""liquidity event"" in the business plan. There is also often sweat equity involved and this is how founders pay themselves. You will find the same type of selling with many successful companies, including Google, shortly after their IPOs and before their parabolic stock appreciation. I remember writing many similar harangues in 2002, about Jeff Bezos when Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) was trading at the bubble price of $10 billion: In that linked thread one can see Bezos and a litany of other executives selling hundreds of thousands of shares as they did on a monthly basis.Stoppelmann has been doing a great job running Yelp but in 2012 received ""only"" $340,657 in total compensation. I think that is rather modest for a CEO building a high growth, publicly traded company. None of that $340k was in stock or option compensation, so he is being prudent rewarding himself out of his equity position as I suspect he will be rewarded with additional stock and options in the future as he continues to make money for shareholders.As an investor, I could sell off my entire portfolio and invest all of my liquid net worth in Yelp today - but I won't. By remaining diversified, do I demonstrate contradiction? Candidly, because my original investment is now up 500% this year, Yelp has become my largest single interest. The reason why I still maintain my long position instead of cashing out and finding ""the next great growth opportunity"" is - as I wrote months ago, I believe Yelp (if not acquired first) will warrant a $8-$10 billion valuation near-term and $25 billion within the next decade largely due to scaling within the two trillion dollar (combined) global industries it is poised to dominate. Given that belief, if I locked in my Yelp profits today and sought to reinvest that capital in an outstanding growth opportunity, I would find myself back in Yelp.Having written several columns making the distinction between Yelp and the infamous Technology/Internet bubble of the 90s (to which it has been erroneously compared) it is unnecessary to enumerate those points already made. However, it is relevant to point out that I did add a nuance to my strategy with Yelp.My price targets are all the same, which is why I am still long. I have however purchased out of the money short-term Put Options on Yelp to participate in possible volatility before the Q3 announcement. I do not look at charts and am anti-technical analysis; however, psychologically I expect a new posse of gun slingers to find going short Yelp irresistible, hence, making some possible profits on their predictability.Disclosure: I am long YELP.

1676142,20411,2013-09-05T15:00:57-04:00,,"By Neal RauAfter doubling over the last 12 months, Yelp Inc. (NYSE:YELP) continues to make strong strides forward in mobile ad revenue with corresponding strong revenue growth and narrowed losses in the Q2 report. Reviews increased by 41%, while unique visitors rose by 38%, but with special focus local business accounts increased by 62% too. Local business reviews continue to draw mobile users and Yelp's mobile app is the most popular tool for consumers on the go. After a big run up in the stock, can the stock continue to move higher, or should investors look to take profits?More and more businesses are aware of their customer's online reviews on Yelp. It is easy for users who might be nearby a restaurant to check out the reviews, and even see pictures of menu items. Yelp encourages users to try new restaurants and businesses, which they might not have been willing to do without feedback from others. Yelp ratings have a material impact on independent restaurants and businesses, and those businesses and the users, who read them, count on the reviews being legitimate.Yelp has a very strong brand, as its business was essentially built by word of mouth. The more reviews on its website, the more likely businesses are to pay to advertise. Yelp reviews are often questioned for authenticity, and this can work in favor or against the business being reviewed, so there are some challenges. Recently, I overheard a bartender talking to customers at the bar; he stated that if they like his service, he would appreciate a positive Yelp review with his name included. He went on to say how the owner looks for employees names, which are mentioned in positive reviews, and rewards them with bonuses. A few people pulled out their smart phones and posted a review right from the Yelp mobile app.One of the most convenient features of the Yelp mobile app is how it integrates with the location-based capabilities on smart phones and mobile devices, which allows users to check reviews on businesses that are nearby. Many companies, even Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), have struggled to drive significant revenues from mobile ads, but Yelp has found a niche in local mobile. The performance of the stock can be attributed to the growth in local mobile, in terms of both traffic and revenue.Stock Review: Yelp's stock broke above resistance recently, and resistance has converted to support. The stock is sitting just above converted support, and thus far, the stock is holding. That makes it a buy according to the report issued by Stock Traders Daily, so long as it holds.Yelp is making great progress with its local business, but competition is growing. Google is still playing catch up, as the company works its recently acquired Zagat, into Google maps. This allows customers to search for local businesses and rate those using Google maps. This is a concern for Yelp because Google accounts for about half of its website traffic. Yelp is going to need to encourage non-app users to find its reviews in a more direct path as a result. Facebook has more than 18 million local businesses and counting, Groupon Inc (NASDAQ:GRPN) and Yahoo! (YHOO) maps are also looking to take their share of the local business revenues, so competition is fierce.In order to stay ahead, Yelp must find better ways to filter the reviews, which will keep users confident that the reviews are legitimate, and avoid tarnishing the brand. Yelp is the most recognized brand in business reviews right now, and the local mobile still has room to grow. Local business ads now make up 81% of total revenues, so finding ways to diversify revenues streams will be important going forward. The stock has a lot of momentum right now, and as long as the stock remains over converted support, as defined in our real time trading report, Stock Traders Daily expects the stock to move higher.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: By Neal Rau for Stock Traders Daily and neither receive compensation from the publicly traded companies listed herein for writing this article."
1848561,25381,2013-11-19T09:10:31-05:00,,"Last week, I was surfing the internet and I came across Google Maps (NASDAQ:GOOG). The website informed me that it had a new version and it urged me to test it. Since curiosity got the best of me, I decided to give it a shot. To my surprise, this was a well-done project that has the potential to eat Yelp's (NYSE:YELP) lunch in the long term.Once I clicked on the link Google provided me, it asked me to enter a search query. The website's suggested query was ""sushi in Boston"" so I used that one. Once you make the search, the website gives you two options to pick from: top reviewers and your circles. Top reviewers option refers to the most active and the best reviewers using Google's network. Your circles option refers to one's friends in Google's network. Basically, when you are searching for sushi in Boston, Google lets you decide whether you will make your decision based on reviews of your friends or Google's top reviewers in Boston.Once you click on one of the options (I picked ""top reviewers"") it showed me a list of places that offer sushi on the map, along with their ratings. This is the exact same thing Yelp does, except that Yelp's mapping system is not as advanced as Google's.For reviews, Google currently uses its Google+ network, Zagat and several other sources. Users are also able to add their own reviews after conducting a search on the map and locating a business. Basically, Google offers everything Yelp offers, and then some more.After passing MapQuest and Yahoo Maps in the mid-2000s, Google Maps became a major force in online mapping. In fact, more than two-thirds of internet users utilize Google Maps for their mapping needs and this is not limited to the PC market either. Even in mobile and tablet markets, Google Maps continues to be dominant. In fact, according to comScore, Google Maps is not only the most popular mapping app, but it is also one of the most popular apps across everything. Currently, Google Maps is being used in 46% of all mobile devices.After being heavily criticized over having many different bugs, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) improved its mapping application big time and it competes with Google Maps for market share of people who use iOS as their mobile operating system. Interestingly, Apple's homegrown mapping application utilizes Yelp reviews when someone searches for a local business using it. As Apple Maps' users continue to increase (estimated to around 35 million compared to 60 million Google Maps users), which helped Yelp's growth greatly. Now that Google is in the game, things might change for Yelp.Yelp is currently priced for perfection and beyond. Investors expect Yelp to grow tremendously over the next several years. While the company continues to grow rapidly on year-to-year basis, we see a different story after looking at quarter-to-quarter growth, which might suggest that the company's growth is slowing down. For example, last quarter, Yelp grew its revenues to $61.18 million. If we look at year-to-year growth, we see a growth rate as high as 68.22% (up from $36.37 million). On the other hand, if we look at the company's quarter-to-quarter growth, we see 11.20%. Annualizing this rate would give us 57.35% as opposed to 68.22%.Since the company doesn't really have positive earnings we will have to value the company using its revenues. Having said that, in the last 4 quarters, Yelp generated $203.49 million in revenues. If the company can grow its earnings by 50% every year (which is a very optimistic scenario and unlikely to happen), it will generate $3.48 billion in revenues by 2020. If we apply a 10% discount rate and value the company at 3 times its revenues, we are looking at about $4.8 billion of valuation for Yelp, which comes down to $72 per share. Keep in mind that this is the most optimistic scenario and this assumes zero dilution. This also assumes that Yelp will be profitable at some point in time.A more realistic scenario would say that Yelp's annual growth will be 50% for the next couple years but it will fall to a 30-35% range after 2015 and to 15-20% range towards 2020. Given that Yelp is much more volatile than the average stock, I would also set the discount rate at 15-20% rather than 10%. This would value Yelp at much lower than $50 (closer to high $30s or low $40s).There is really no way to justify Yelp's current share price. The company has no earnings, its revenue growth is slowing down, it is facing increasing amount of competition, it keeps diluting its shares and the business model doesn't look very sustainable. Yelp's business is very easy to copy and I don't really see how it is that much different than the internet companies we saw during the dotcom bubble of late 1990s.Disclosure: I am long AAPL.

1653692,34541,2013-08-23T10:15:18-04:00,,"Once upon a time when the Internet was new, a chat room on AOL would have been the closest thing to ""Social Media"". Then suddenly there came a promising website called classmates.com. The web domain was user friendly, easy to remember and made it clear what the visitor should expect.Over a period of years from the late 1990s into the middle 2000s, Classmates grew at a steady pace. It got to a point where one could find many of their old friends on there. The members were easily in the millions, if not tens of millions and they were getting close to achieving the state of ""critical mass"" important for a company to obtain web dominance.Everything seemed to be going well and the future looked favorable for Classmates. But in the background, over a period of years two companies known as MySpace and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) were gradually taking hold. Initially these young companies seemed to appeal more to the teenagers, college kids and celebrities. We know the rest of the story with Facebook winning the battle for critical mass and of course MySpace faded into obscurity. But little has been spoken about what Facebook did to Classmates. In reality, Classmates had a head start on Facebook and MySpace. When I think about MySpace the phrase ""I could have been a contender"" comes to mind. If they had a slightly different business model, they might have had the $80 billion IPO instead of Zuckerberg. If you never used it, Classmates had many similar capabilities of early social media. What did them in was their closed system that allowed users to post limited bios and photos but required users to become subscribing members if they wanted to have any meaningful communication with their friends.With 38 million registered users they were on their way to being dominant but this subscription model of theirs proved far inferior to the Facebook model in the long run. Once Facebook took off it was all over for Classmates. They quickly achieved irrelevance and sold off to United Online Inc. (NASDAQ:UNTD), for a meager $100 million.Investors can learn from past strategic blunders and profit from them when we see similar strategies employed by companies in various industries with similar circumstances. The other important ingredient is that the company being shorted for this strategic error must be over-valued with a market price that defies basic sense.Right now, one such opportunity can be found in the field of Consumer Reviews. The highly publicized company Angie's List, Inc. (NASDAQ:ANGI) , which engages in collections of consumer reviews on local service providers ranging from home improvement to health care is in a position similar to that of Classmates.com when you compare the formidable threat posed by free social media rising star Yelp (NYSE:YELP) and the billion user strong giant that clobbered Classmates.com years ago-Facebook.YELP is in the early stages toward reaching critical mass. Large and growing numbers of reviews in a wider range of sectors available free of charge -is probably preferable to hundreds of millions of consumers over the more esoteric pay subscription model. Angie's List is trapped because their sales pitch from day one has been based upon their subscription model supposedly being more credible and if they switched to a free model, it would be Angie's List who would lose all credibility. To change course would require them to declare that they got it wrong and essentially start over from scratch.The reason why the service of Classmates became obsolete was because the very simple service they offered-a way for classmates to find each other and reconnect-was one of many corollaries of Facebook's application. Even though Facebook didn't necessarily set out to take down Classmates, they became collateral damage. That is obvious because by virtue of near 20% of the global population and the majority of western civilization having an account on Facebook, consumers had a much higher probability of finding their former classmates from high school and college on Facebook. Who in their right mind would pay Classmates $50 a year or more to find less people than they could on Facebook besides perhaps the people who still pay AOL a monthly fee for dial up?Because Yelp targets additional and much larger sectors than does Angie's List, I doubt they feel threatened by Angie's. Their main competition would be Facebook and OpenTable Inc, (NASDAQ:OPEN) which is now partnering with Facebook. But Angie's List has every reason to expect to be clobbered by Yelp. Angie's doesn't have a bad model. It's just that Yelp, like Facebook over Classmates, has a -better- model.The crux of this thesis is basic business sense and the obvious problems for Angie's should be self-evident at the macro and philosophical level. My past analysis on Angie's brought me to the conclusion that this company may survive with its little niche of possibly loyal, paying subscribers (time will tell how loyal after YELP and FB further dominate this market), but it should not warrant a market cap anywhere near the current $1.3-$1.6 billion market cap.I have read some columns questioning the accounting methodology that put a $0 market cap prediction on them but I am not a forensic accountant and will leave that speculation to others. My best case scenario for Angie's List projects a market cap of $200-$300 million based upon the fact that there are approximately 313 million people in the U.S. and 24% of them are under the age of 18 according to U.S. census data. If one out of 10 of the remaining Americans pay to subscribe to such a service, that makes a total pie of around 24 million potential-paying-subscribers. Ask 10 random people as often as you like and see if better than an average of 1 out of 10 would pay for such a subscription year after year in this economy. Angie's is also bringing in revenue by selling ads to vendors and there are accusations of conflicts of interest with that. Nevertheless, when you have such a limited number of potential subscribers, that growth will be limited.Angie's List has been in existence since 1995 and just recently reached the 2 million subscriber mark last quarter. Contrast that with Yelp's numbers and you can see a tremendous difference in potential future revenue. According to Yelp's CFO Robert J. Krolik on their Q2 conference call, ""we added over 3.4 million reviews in the quarter."" That my friends is a large number of new reviews that give users a great deal of feedback for due diligence. Krolik continued, ""our average monthly unique visitors grew 38% year-over-year to roughly 108 million . Approximately 32% of these uniques are accessing our mobile site."" (bold emphasis added)With the death of the PC and more consumers using mobile, they are growing substantially in all of the right places. The average monthly unique users are roughly 108 million??? Compare that with Angie's List's total of approximately 2 million paying subscribers and you can see why Yelp may be to Angie's List what Facebook was to Classmates.comThe question left is what will Facebook be to Yelp? I believe Yelp is close to reaching critical mass in its unique niche that happens to be a trillion plus market cap when you add up the numbers elucidated by the National Restaurant Association's website and factor in the media and entertainment industry estimated to be $2 trillion (globally).I believe that Facebook has many characteristics that portend favorably to the consumer review industry but I do not believe they will substantially quell the growth of Yelp. The parallel I would draw between Facebook and Yelp would be more akin to the competitive situation between Netflix and Amazon. I believe Yelp like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will continually grow at an impressive rate because they were built to do one thing and they both do it very well in their respective niches. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) like Facebook has a much larger scope but they will certainly find some success.To summarize some key factors that make Yelp an attractive long term buy:Last but not least I want to emphasize some points made here at SA in those valuable comments that ensue underneath these great columns. We had a nice dialogue under a good column written by one of my peers (about ANGI). You can see from the screen shot below that this comment came before YELP's surprise Q2 earnings announcement. This contains some additional thoughts on ANGI and addresses that popular ""no barrier to entry"" objection by YELP shorts.I already closed out my short position in Angie's List back in July; so I have no interest in Angie's but am long both Facebook and Yelp. Channeling Obi Wan Kenobi, let me help those who are looking for a short sale opportunity in the Consumer Review sector: YELP is Not The Short You're Looking For (Hint: Short ANGI if you must short something in this sector).Disclosure: I am long YELP, FB.

1682942,23625,2013-09-09T19:33:06-04:00,,"For the past year I have been amazingly bullish on Yelp (NYSE:YELP), both the company and the stock. I’ve held this view for several reasons, but mostly due to the untapped potential of what Yelp has the opportunity to become and what I felt would be an awakening of the market to that potential. Remember, the market does not integrate new information as it goes, it’s often a situation where the market doesn’t care until it cares. This is the inefficiency that can be taken advantage of.Yelp’s run from $20 to $60 a share is evidence that this has taken place, while Yelp still doesn’t turn a non-GAAP profit on a quarterly basis. Their revenue growth rate continues to hover in the high 60% range, neither accelerating or decelerating. In my opinion a large portion of the run has come from changing opinions regarding Yelp’s ability to continue to grow at that rate versus previous sentiment that it was already decelerating to a large extent and its ability to monetize was not that large compared to their social media peers Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and LinkedIn (LNKD). As you can see in the chart below, the company continues to crush both Wall Street and Estimize consensus estimates for revenue quarter after quarter.I believe deeply in the theory of unbundling, that as an industry matures each piece of it gets broken out into its own service, its own business. What is taking place over at Craigslist is the perfect example. I think the industry has matured enough that if the average person wants to search for a restaurant they go to Yelp, they won’t just settle for Google, just as if you are searching for a place to crash in another city, you go to Airbnb, not Craigslist short term sublets.But Yelp has a problem. As it acquires more and more content from its users, very valuable content, it is running into relevancy issues. The signal to noise ratio is getting bad, and it’s hard to trust what I see there anymore given the rampant self promotion that takes place. Yelp is trying to fight this through legal battles, which is completely the wrong way to do it.The right way to scale is to use data science in order to provide relevancy and trust. This can be accomplished through using a system of weightings and measurements that are not difficult to build. I implore Yelp to move in this direction before people abandon the platform due to too much noise. Below are a few ways that you can increase the signal.Now let’s talk for a second about a recommendation system, because Yelp is awful, I mean just awful for this, it’s just a sea of data with nothing pointing you in the right direction. Some things Yelp can do to change this and cement itself as the go to place for any time I need to figure out where to eat.There are a million other things you can build here, that’s just a slice in the 10 minutes I took to think about it.Yelp has a lot of upside potential but in order to take the next step for the company and the stock it needs to wrap its head around the data science aspect. I think a lot of the misunderstanding that was present in the stock a year ago has been removed and it’s starting to be priced more fairly for its growth and potential growth. This is a pivotal time for the company.Full Disclosure: Nothing on this site should ever be considered to be advice, research or an invitation to buy or sell any securities."

1658212,52792,2013-08-26T18:59:48-04:00,,"Trading at more than 200 times FY 2014 consensus earnings estimates, you'd think there isn't a problem in sight for Yelp (NYSE:YELP). Yet, as detailed in a Fast Company article, angel investor Peter Shankman is betting Yelp will be out of business within 24 months. He cites two reasons: One, consumers are turning to more trusted sources for reviews, such as friends and family, online. Two, business are complaining Yelp is burying positive reviews of companies that don't advertise with them.The latter allegations gained prominence recently when a town hall for business owners put on by Yelp went awry. At the event, the audience criticized Yelp for aggressive sales tactics and bogus reviews.As this article highlights, a certain number of bogus reviews will always exist. Researchers at MIT and Northwestern found, for instance, that 5% of online reviews at a major retailer were written by people with no record of actually purchasing the items reviewed. And, of course, Yelp reviews don't always do an establishment justice, as shown in this article about three-Michelin-star restaurants getting one-star Yelp ratings.The issue is important to small business owners because there is evidence that Yelp really does matter. As this Harvard study shows, Yelp ratings do have a material impact on independent restaurants. Yelp's ability to drive revenue to small business might at first seem very bullish for the company. But it's advertising that Yelp needs to drive revenue, not just reviews. And therein lies the problem. As the Harvard study shows, chain restaurants are not materially affected by Yelp reviews. So Yelp needs to depend on independents. But the very power of the rating system means that advertising in this case should be ineffective. If you are a small business with great reviews on Yelp, do you also need to advertise on Yelp? And if you have poor reviews on Yelp, do you want to help fund a site bashing your business?In part, I believe it is this quandary that is fueling conspiracy theories of Yelp manipulating reviews based on whether or not businesses are advertising with Yelp. The thinking probably goes like this: The only real value Yelp has is its reviews, so review manipulation must be what Yelp is selling. But I believe the real long-term problem with Yelp's business model is Shankman's first point. There is evidence to suggest that Yelp reviews, once truly valuable, are losing some of their value. Yelp likes to compare itself to YouTube -- what YouTube is doing to television, Yelp is doing to the yellow pages. But new evidence suggests that what YouTube is doing to television, YouTube might also be doing to Yelp.According to Zocalo Group's 2013 Recommendations Study, YouTube -- not Yelp -- is now the most credible source for online recommendations. A friend liking a brand page on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is second. Traditional online reviews like Yelp are third. Yelp claims to bring ""word of mouth"" online and is trying to position itself as a social media play. But clearly, reviews from YouTube and Facebook are more ""word of mouth"" and more ""social media"" than Yelp. Plainly, your friend's reviews on Facebook are more valuable than random, anonymous postings on Yelp. Yelp likes to trumpet ""powerful network effects,"" but who has more powerful network effects: YouTube and Facebook? Or Yelp?So, in Yelp we have an advertising business model that doesn't make sense that has been given a pass because of the truly useful reviews that Yelp used to generate, and the promise of increasing network effects. So what happens now that those reviews are quickly losing their relevance due to encroachment by two of the most disruptive companies of our generation -- Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook?Perhaps Shankman's pronouncement is just a publicity stunt, but we are seeing major insider selling at Yelp, and management's unwillingness to deal in the numbers is disconcerting. I'll give two examples. During the most recent earnings call, analyst Stephen Ju asked management about dropping ARPU (average revenue per user). The response from the CFO? ""We don't really look at it that way."" Likewise, when analyst Mark May asked management to comment on the fact that average reviews per unique visitor is not growing, the COO responded: ""...a little bit like ARPU, that's certainly a ratio you can look at. It's not one we pay a lot of attention to internally.""Can Yelp keep going up? Sure. Trading at around 19 times revenue, Yelp stopped responding to fundamentals long ago. But don't call buying Yelp anything but speculation at this point. And now that YouTube and Facebook may be displacing Yelp reviews, it seems to be particularly dangerous speculation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1629562,34541,2013-08-12T14:54:13-04:00,,"After Yelp (NYSE:YELP) substantially exceeded the second-quarter consensus, the share price escalated by approximately 23%. The news was followed with several columns authored by skeptics who made great effort to draw parallels to the Internet bubble of the late 90s. In his column titled ""A little Reminder of What Happened in 1999,"" Seeking Alpha contributor George Kesarios drew a comparison between the valuation of today's YELP and the castles in the air of that era, specifically Yahoo and Intel.Having long been a value investor first and foremost often put me on the short side of the market in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Back then the ""short"" side was where the real value was. Regarding the era itself, I agree with all Kesarios pointed out. Yahoo and Intel were indeed bubbles and I made near 10 fold returns being short each of those companies via Put options. (Anyone can make such claims; therefore, I include links below this article to time-stamped, 3rd-party blogs in which I expatiated upon my reasoning for being short some of the most notorious bubbles in modern history).I haven't changed much since then and am still active on the short side of the market - yet I am long Yelp. Amateur short sellers have this dead wrong, mainly because they are using unimaginative, cookie cutter thinking and plug-in formulas in their analysis. One can follow their publications and see that they use very similar rhetoric and level often unfounded charges against every stock they short. The problem with canned analysis is that it works on some stocks in the way throwing darts might work. They succeed in spite of themselves. It's bound to happen occasionally. It is dangerous to make blanket statements about companies and casuistry to compare standard price multiples between companies that are in quite different businesses one from another.When Yahoo, AOL and Intel were trading at those large multiples to revenues, those companies had market caps in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Yahoo had barely ever turned a profit at that point!When you are trading at near a quarter trillion market cap a couple years out of the gate, it is pretty hard to pull off an encore unless you do what Google has done and revolutionize new industries with hardware, smartphones, virtual reality glasses and even self-driving cars. That's all you have to do!YELP is not even close to where YAHOO or Intel were valued at the time Kesarios points out. Yahoo and Intel had nowhere to go but down as an enormous number of Americans were already using their products and services. There were not as many new markets or new customers left for them at that point and their market caps had already baked in their best-case scenarios for the future.YELP is a relatively small company gaining critical mass in a multi-trillion dollar industry. Sure, 7x revenue is a high multiple in general but not necessarily when the revenue is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Yelp has a unique mixture of growing revenue sources. Some of its services such as ""Yelp Deals"" and gift certificates allow it to actually share revenue from the sales it generates similar to companies like Priceline and Groupon while capitalizing on the highly effective local ad revenue around the nation and internationally.Yelp is positioned to capitalize on effective strategies of multiple industry leaders, giving it diversified revenue sources. While reading many restaurant reviews, my impression was that not only were many of the reviews helpful, it was apparent that there exists a strong social media aspect to Yelp. The readers can read and follow personalities within the community that they find particularly helpful or even entertaining. Many of the members have long established histories, profiles and even photographs of themselves. Anthony Weiner is not a member as far as I can tell.The social media aspect of this helps to solidify Yelp's growth and appeal. Consumers tend to stick with services that build a strong sense of community and by virtue of there being copious quantities of reviews for virtually every restaurant in my area (and other areas I checked around the nation), it is clear this service is going to continue to grow exponentially. As Jim Cramer put it ""Yelp is winning in a number of different ways. First, as more and more people use the service, it becomes harder and harder for businesses of all types not to be on the service. And as more and more businesses get listed, well, that only drives more people to the site in a virtuous circle.""In my previous column, Why Yelp Is Still By Far Undervalued, I enumerated the annual revenues of the restaurant and entertainment industries in which it is on the cusp of dominating. I compared them with the revenues of the $800+ billion annual travel industry.The Priceline.com (PCLN) comparison was appropriate because it too has plenty of competition with other travel websites like Expedia, Orbitz, Hotels.com, etc. Yet - Priceline still commands a $48 Billion market cap notwithstanding competition and it only trades at a P/E multiple of 31.In industries of this size whether you are talking about restaurants, airline tickets, hotels, social media or automobiles - there always seems to be room for a handful of players to compete - and still grow into revenues and market caps in the tens of billions or more for each company. You often end up with a half to a dozen major players. The cream rises to the top and it is clear that Yelp will be at or near the top of the leader board.The competition concerns being propounded by the Yelp short sellers have a dampened ring of desperation and fear mongering. The assertions that Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) or any of the others will ""easily replicate"" the Yelp strategy do not have basis in e-commerce history. I can definitely understand why shorts would come to such erroneous conclusions because I too thought that way when I was younger and the Internet was in uncharted territory.They are erroneous conclusions yet they are partially right. The aforementioned giants can replicate the web applications. They are erroneous in that they are misunderstanding the other key part of the equation - the consumer. They are fallaciously assuming ""if you build it, they will come."" Perhaps if you build a baseball diamond in a cornfield it will indeed resurrect dead baseball legends. But just because Google announces ""we're now in the restaurant business"" doesn't mean the people who love its search capabilities are going to prefer Google to meet that particular need. As we have seen, just because Google builds the infrastructure for a web store doesn't mean the billion people who use Google search or Android phones are going to stop using Amazon and eBay to instead shop Google's store.This is also a case that I made in the past for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), but it also applies to Yelp in a broad sense. I have had my YouTube account since 2004 and I use it daily. However, I have absolutely no interest in streaming my movies on YouTube and have for years stuck with Netflix for that facet of my entertainment needs. I like the way Netflix serves those needs and do not mind paying for it.I remember back when Netflix started the streaming service around 2004. Before having those Redbox machines in its entrances, Wal-Mart was touted by the NFLX short sellers and the media as being on the verge of crushing Netflix because it had grandiose notions of launching its own movie rental business, digital download and all. Surely Wal-Mart is so large, has so much capital and an enormous customer base that dwarfed Netflix - there was no way Netflix would survive. What ever happened to those predictions? With limitless capital and all of those customers, how could it fail to destroy the much smaller Netflix? It is a false assertion to make it sound as though all a company needs is a large customer base and plenty of capital to run ads, in order to become the leader and simultaneously destroy the competition - in any industry.In my bullish articles about Netflix from January 2013, before the share price went on its parabolic tear, I shared my valuable lesson from shorting Amazon.com back in 2002, and illustrated how I used that mistake to make great returns on future investments like Netflix:Why Netflix Will Continue to Dominate And Confound BearsShort interest is high and those shorting YELP are playing a dangerous game. It seems their goal is to press it down as much as they can with plenty of time to exit before the next earnings report. However, there may come a day before then in which these shares gap up substantially, creating a whole new crop of wait-staff to work at the companies YELP users are reviewing.I can see the commercial now, reminiscent of the Turbo Tax commercial where home owner ""Allen"" walks into his kitchen and realizes that the handyman working under his sink did his taxes last week…Only this commercial features a customer who recognizes his waiter:Allen (Customer): ""Bob, what happened, I thought you managed a hedge fund for a living…?""Bob (Waiter): ""I got caught up in a short squeeze with YELP in Q3. Would you like baked or mashed potatoes with your steak sir?""The short interest is at almost 23% of the float and increasing. The burden is on these speculators because they have to get out of their positions before more phenomenal news comes public - and it will for years to come without Yelp being acquired. As it captures its percentage of the trillion dollar industries in which it effectually operates, this is a company with a Priceline type future monetarily.Time-stamped, 3rd-party blogs in which I expatiated upon my reasoning for being short Yahoo, Intel and AOL at their peaks.On INTC - INTCRegarding Yahoo I remember haranguing my audience like a fire and brimstone preacher from the studios of WSBR 740AM, equating the valuations to stories of the tulip bulb craze and the infamous South Sea Bubble. I remember having purchased the Put options on Yahoo with the $40 strike price while Yahoo was at that time trading at a $180 BILLION market cap. At $180-$200 a share, to the vast majority of the investing public, it was inconceivable that Yahoo could ever go as low as $40.That's why I was able to get the LEAPS with durations of a year for pennies on the dollar. There was very little premium on the time horizons since it had been so long since the world had seen a bubble like this. I did the same with the AOL Puts. AOL had at that time had surpassed AT&T as the most widely held stock in America!On AOL Disclosure: I am long YELP, FB. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha). I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article."
1602942,25381,2013-08-04T14:24:40-04:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is one of the internet stocks that show me that people never learn. In 1999, investors were buying up companies with no profits hand over fist. When the bubble ended up bursting, many investors got burned badly, and it took many investors many years to recover their losses. Yelp resembles those stocks people used to love so much during the tech bubble of the late 1990s. Every time there is a development regarding the company, the share price shoots up by another 10-15%. Currently, the company is valued at $3.7 billion even though it is actually worth far less than that. Here are the 5 reasons Yelp's valuation doesn't make sense.Reason 1: the fundamentals don't look attractive at all. I understand that companies like Yelp should trade like a start-up company and investors shouldn't worry too much about fundamentals. Yet, I can't help but notice that the company has never been profitable and that its chances of being highly profitable in the future are slim. Every time Yelp is able to grow its revenues, it ends up growing its expenses at an even faster rate. Yelp has a large sales department and the company's revenue growth barely keeps up with expenses. For example, in 2009, Yelp generated $25.81 million in revenues, but it spent $22.58 on administration and sales, and another $3.24 million on research and development. Next year, Yelp's revenues jumped to $47.73 million whereas its operating expenses jumped to $57.24. In 2011, as the revenues grew to $83 million, operating expenses grew to $99 million. Last year, Yelp generated $137 million in revenues and spent $156 million to generate that revenue. Year to date, Yelp generated $101 million in revenues, but spent $106 million on operations. At some point, the company's revenues will have to grow a lot faster than its expenses do, but this has never happened in the company's history. Yelp currently trades for 14 times its expected revenues and infinity times its earnings (since it doesn't have positive earnings or positive operating income).In order to justify today's valuation, Yelp would have to increase its net income to $350-360 million at some point in the future. Looking at the trends in the company's margins, it would have to generate at least $2 billion in revenues to achieve that, which would mean that the company would have to grow its revenues by more than 10 times while its expenses grow much slower than that. The analysts expect Yelp to report a loss this year, followed by earning $0.18 in 2014, $0.54 in 2015 and $1.16 in 2016. If the company earns 18 cents next year and grows its earnings by 100% every year until the end of the decade and we apply 15% discount rate, the discounted cash flow analysis values the company at $44.50 per share. Keep in mind that doubling its income every year for the next 6 years would be pretty tough for the company and 15% is a conservative discount rate for a stock as volatile as this one. Usually companies in start-up status get higher discount rates due to their volatility. After all, riskier stocks should be more rewarding, right?Reason 2: There is constant dilution at Yelp. Since the company is not very profitable, it is generous about paying its employees with stock options. Ever since the company became a public company, its share count has been going up, and this trend isn't likely to stop anytime soon. Because Yelp isn't very profitable and its shares are very expensive, the company is not in a position to conduct any buybacks. Last year, when Yelp announced its IPO, there were 59.87 million outstanding shares. Next quarter, this number climbed to 61.19 million. In the third quarter of 2012, Yelp had 62.22 million outstanding shares, which rose further to 63.51 million in the fourth quarter. In the first quarter of this year, the number of outstanding Yelp shares increased to 64.29 million. In the last year, the number of outstanding Yelp shares increased by 4.42 million (7.4%). I expect the dilution to accelerate in the next few weeks because employees are more likely to exercise their options right after a strong rally. Does Yelp have a back-up plan in case dilution gets out of control? The company would have to be profitable in order to buy back shares or pay its employees more so that they don't have to rely on stock sales for a living. Then, Yelp's operating expenses would get even higher.Reason 3: Competition is emerging pretty strongly. Up until now, Yelp grew with very little competition because the yellow book market has been shrinking for a while. Lately, two companies, namely Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) took a notice of the potential in the local businesses for advertisement purposes. Google bought Zagat and incorporated it into its Google Maps product. Now users can search for local businesses and rate them (or read the reviews on them) using Google Maps. This is a game changer for Yelp. Additionally, in the latest conference call, Facebook reported having pages for more than 18 million local businesses and the list is expected to grow rapidly as we move forward. There might be even more entrants to the market as Nokia's HERE, Groupon, Bing and Yahoo Maps will be looking to eat some slices from the local business pie. Once the competition intensifies, Yelp's growth prospects will be much more limited than they are right now.Reason 4: Yelp's relationship with small businesses is deteriorating. Yelp has a lot of angry customers and they are pretty loud and clear about their anger. More than 700 small business owners have filed FTC complaints with Yelp over a variety of issues. Even in Yelp's on page, the company is rated as 3 stars, down from 4.2 stars last year. There are tens of news stories where local business owners claim that Yelp's sales people approach them with promises of The company uses a special algorithm to filter out reviews that it considers to be unreal. The reviews that are seen to be ""bad"" by Yelp's algorithm are being sent to a separate section where they are not included in a local company's average score. There are problems with this though. Yelp doesn't explain what its algorithm is based on. In some cases, more than half of the reviews are filtered out. Many business owners claim that there is a pattern in what is being filtered, where positive reviews get filtered out if they refuse to buy advertisement from Yelp. This is a very serious accusation, and I am not capable of judging whether it is true or not; however, there are thousands of such stories on the internet, and regardless of whether the stories are true or not, they hurt Yelp's relationship with its biggest source of income, the small businesses. If a company collects its revenues from small businesses, it has to be in a good relationship with small businesses. Companies who have bad relationships with their customers don't stay in business for long. I am not saying Yelp's business model is scam; however, there seems to be a lot of bad apples in the company's sales force.Reason 5: Yelp is likely to have legal troubles in the future. When thousands of small business owners are angry, not only will they take their advertisement money elsewhere, but also they will be tempted to take legal action against Yelp. Imagine a local restaurant with 10 reviews, 5 good and 5 bad reviews. What happens if Yelp filters out the 5 good reviews and leaves the restaurant with 5 bad reviews and a terrible rating to deal with? The restaurant will lose a lot of potential clients who look it up on Yelp. Many business owners claim and this is exactly what is happening at the moment, and this resulted in a lawsuit a while back. While the court decided that there wasn't enough evidence to prove that Yelp was:however, there will be more lawsuits coming up in the near future as more small business owners feel like they are being hurt by Yelp's practices. In fact a law company is already collecting data from small business owners for its next lawsuit.Some of the user comments on Yelp's own website are pretty strong and a large number of people claim that they were approached by Yale's sales people who saw changes in their business page after the encounter.For example a small business owner from Vista, California posted:Here is a similar post from another small business owner in Santa Clemente:There are literally hundreds of similar comments which you can read by checking the link I provided. In Better Business Bureau's website, more than 1,000 similar complaints are listed against Yelp. Reportedly, the company responds all the complaints with a generic, ""Our filter is an automated system and there is nothing we can do about it,"" response. Legally, Yelp can't be held responsible from the reviews that appear on its website, because each person is responsible for his or her postings. On the other hand, Yelp might be punishable if its sales representatives are found to approach people with promises of The case is difficult to prove, but if enough small business owners testify against Yelp, this might change things.In conclusion, Yelp doesn't seem like a good bet right now, even though the stock is being pumped up to the moon. I don't suggest shorting the company either because of it's too dangerous to short hype.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1537912,50512,2013-07-08T12:00:53-04:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) was incorporated in 2004 to aid the general public in their search for local doctors, hair salons, and other such services. Over the years, Yelp has shown a lot of promise transitioning from a standalone provider of reviews to a growing platform for social media. Unique visits to the site touched the 102 million mark (a 43% y/y increase) during 1Q2013, a benchmark in its own right. As a result, the total site reviews crossed the 39 million mark.

Yelp completed its IPO in March, 2012.Yelp, a $2.2 billion company compared to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), a $292.1 billion company, is almost 132 times smaller. Yelp witnessed a y/y growth of 68% for the 1Q2013 compared to Google, which witnessed a growth of 31% for the same period. Yelp is a debtless company unlike Google.The performance was mainly attributable to its compelling metrics in the form of cumulative reviews, unique visitors, and the number of active local business accounts. The company's active businesses and claimed local businesses approximated 45,000 (or a 63% y/y increase) and 1.1 million (or a 58% y/y increase), respectively. Though the company could not register profit, the net loss of $4.8 million reflects a better picture compared to the $9.8 million net loss of a year ago. But the company really needs to work on its margins and attain a positive position.Yelp has an edge over peers like TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP) in the sense that the company's solid social network and integration with Apple's iOS 6 has translated into more organic traffic. The company's transition towards a social platform has enabled the company to secure itself a safer position in terms of competition from Google.Yelp has also built a homepage like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and LinkedIn (LNKD), which displays various details of the user's acquaintances.Yelp is expecting its FY2013 revenue to range between $216 million and $218 million, a growth of 58% y/y. The company's adjusted EBITDA has been projected to range between $21 million and $23 million.(Click to enlarge)The past year has been a very eventful year for Yelp, resplendent with an IPO, product launches, expansion in Germany and the U.K., and the acquisition of Qype, one of the leading local reviews sites of Europe. Yelp completed the acquisition of Qype in October, 2012 for ~$50 million. The acquisition was aimed to capture 2 million reviews and 15 million unique visitors each month spanning 13 countries.Presently, Yelp operates in 20 countries. Revenue of the company registered a y/y growth of 65% in FY2012 to $137.6 million. The company's earnings per share for FY2012 was $0.35 against earnings of $(1.10) per share during FY2011. The cash position for FY2012 stood at $95.1 million compared to $21.7 million, primarily due to the IPO proceeds. The company is projecting a revenue growth of 58% during FY2013, lying in the range of $216 million - $218 million.Google had failed in its efforts to acquire Yelp in 2009 for ~$500 million. However, that did not deter Google from acquiring Yelp's competitor, Zagat, in 2011.Google scores brownie points through integration of the Places feature on Google Maps which enables the user to find and place the local businesses into the Map after rating them. Secondly, Google Maps has also been able to create a Yelp-like experience through its review site, Zagat. Google Maps has become the most popular mapping service for Android and Apple iOS devices and is directly integrated into the Android system. They enable the user to find out the required restaurant, make reservations through a call, and provide road directions as well. The Google Street View feature enables the user to get acquainted with the surroundings even before arriving at their destination. However, Yelp is limited by a list view or map view and lacks the social element of Google+.Further, Yelp heavily relies on Google for the transfer of unrefined search visitors. The company's search engine referral traffic is less than half of that of Google search. Yelp is also crippled by its huge sales force as its SG&A consumed more than 85% of the revenue for 2012.To make the path even more difficult, Facebook's ""Nearby"" feature for Android and iOS mobile devices enables the user to arrange businesses by category and view supplementary details, like Facebook business pages. Nearby's star rating system bears resemblance to Yelp and is being foreseen as a threat to Yelp. Facebook, unlike Yelp, does not have to depend on the local advertisers for survival. Facebook Home, the new home screen launcher replacement for Android, has the ability to shatter the existence of Yelp.In other words, Google and Facebook are more than adequately equipped with a user base, the mobile presence, and capital to takeover Yelp.Yelp's CEO, Jeremy Stoppelman, even accused Google of stealing matter from Yelp without license. When Yelp brought the matter to notice, Google threatened the company with removing the search results from Google, which left Yelp with no choice.On the brighter side, Yelp has beaten its peers in terms of IPO and has shot up by more than 20% since March, 2012 compared to Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), which have fallen by more than 60%. Yelp is leading in terms of its enterprise value-to-sales multiple of 11.8, against Groupon's, Zynga's, and Facebook's of 1.4, 7.6, and 9, respectively.Yelp is also concentrating on mobile growth and broadening its horizons across the world and local businesses. The company's mobile app usage is strong and growing, and accounts for 30% of total monthly unique visits. The mobile app has already been installed in ~10 million mobile devices across the world and accounts for 36% of the company's ads as of 1Q2013, an increase of 25% compared to 4Q2012. Yelp has also built an open data standard (LIVES) to append health inspection scores to restaurant business pagesYelp also launched display ads in France and Spain during 1Q2013 and credited itself for the accomplishment of one million unique monthly visitors in Spain. The company also added New Zealand to its bouquet. Despite all these efforts, the company's international revenue only added up to 6% of its bottom line.Yelp has also joined hands with local businesses to ascertain the effect of Yelp reviews. According to the Boston Consulting Group, a single free business owner account of Yelp translated into average annual revenue improvement of $8,000 for the local businesses. Secondly, the local businesses earned annual revenue of $23,000 on an average by buying ads on Yelp worth $4,000 annually. However, that has not spared Yelp from allegations of fabricating the truth for a bribe.In this cut-throat competition industry, Yelp's chance of survival can only be through a good partnership with the likes of Google or Facebook. However, since both of them have their exclusive social-review platform, the chances of another alliance is pretty bleak. In fact, Yahoo (YHOO) is contemplating the acquisition of publicly traded companies like Yelp and Pandora (NYSE:P) to compete with Google. However, the company's impressive statistics in terms of reviews and traffic, improving quarterly results and cash position, followed by expansion initiatives, serve as a precursor in terms of the company's conviction and ambitions. Yelp's stock prices rose 64% on the first day of its trading to $24.58 and continued making waves on its 52nd day of trade by rising 19.88% to $30.33. ZenithOptimedia has projected a growth of 3.9% in global advertising expenditure for 2013, or $518 billion by the year end, which can really turn the tables for Yelp. Yelp, presently trading at $34.99, has made it clear that it is here to stay.(Click to enlarge)Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1547642,43721,2013-07-14T07:34:27-04:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) acts as a city guide for people, allowing them to make educated, appropriate decisions regarding various businesses in their area, all through the website yelp.com. Today the company has expanded its services in most of the North American and European markets and is looking to reach consumers in many additional markets. The company's stock was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in March 2012 and since then has traded in the range of $15-$40 per share.Industry overview The world is witnessing a trend where more advertisers are going online. Last year, local advertisement was a $96 billion market, of which online advertisement contributed about $19.9 million. This year the local advertising market will reach to $101 billion, and the online segment will make up approximately $23 billion. Therefore, out of an additional $5 billion in spending this year, more than 60% is attributable to online advertisements. One of the primary contributors to this increase is the mobile advertising platform, which will contribute to nearly 88% of total online advertisements by 2016 as compared to just 6.3% now.This article will explain the change in trend towards online advertisements and whether Yelp's current stock price justifies its true potential.The way towards growthI think the following points will lead to Yelp's growth:1) Yellow pages losing out to online advertisers The print directory segment of the U.S. yellow pages market shows a path which can only improve online advertisers' revenue. As there has been a shift towards online advertisements, the print directory segment will lose its market share to online advertisers in the future. Therefore, this currently $6.9 billion segment is expected to decline at 11% CAGR through 2015. This decline made me think; what part of this opportunity can be captured by Yelp?A survey of 500 U.S. citizens regarding the U.S. online advertising market sheds light on Yelp's opportunity. The survey showed increasing U.S. consumer awareness about Yelp, and it highlighted that almost 16% of respondents used Yelp for their local search and the majority wrote reviews on Yelp's website. Additionally, the majority of Yelp's users were in the 18-29 age group as compared to the yellow pages whose users distribution is skewed towards the older age group. Yelp's demographic advantage will lead to more reviews being written on its website and therefore increasing its customer base.2) The model of monetization of free The company has chosen a free subscription model. Under this model, the reviews posted on the company's website can be read free of cost. For businesses where a majority of the revenue is earned by selling online reviews, it becomes important for the company to attract audiences to its site and let them understand the services and products provided by different businesses. In the first quarter of 2013, the company reached a whopping 39 million written reviews on its website. Further, a recent study indicated that companies that advertise on Yelp saw an average annual revenue increase of $23,000. I believe this will increase over time and will attract more clients to Yelp's business.Revenue from different segments will be as follows:1) Mobile penetration- A key revenue driver for brand ads segment High penetration through mobile devices and the increasing use of smartphone devices led Yelp to focus on its brand ads segment. This segment contributes 11% of Yelp's value and registered growth of 16% year-over-year last year, attributed to the increase in the number of mobile visitors to its website. In the current year, average monthly unique visitor count will reach 120 million, from 86 million last year, and approximately 30% will be mobile visitors. With the smartphone devices outpacing the use of personal computers, I expect the estimated contribution from mobile users to be on the higher side.Even if I consider the contribution from the mobile users to be 30% and an estimate of 300 pages viewed per user per month, the total monthly views by unique mobile users turns out to be 2.19 billion pages. The company currently charges advertisers $1.50 per thousand impressions. With this, the company can generate additional revenue of $3.3 million, which will lead the overall revenue from this segment to $28.5 million this year up from $20.6 million in 2012.Note: If the contribution from mobile users turns out to be more than 30%, there will be a further upside potential for this segment.2) Local advertising Last year, Yelp had 38,000 active business accounts and generated an average revenue per account, or ARPA, of approximately $2,800. The number of active business accounts is expected to increase further as Yelp has been aggressively expanding its services in different geographies. Presently, Yelp has over 35 million written reviews, covering more than 606,000 businesses. With its existing marketing strategy and sales force, the company has been looking to explore new markets in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. It expanded its operations in 20 countries in 2012 and will continue the pace in the current year as well. Therefore, I expect Yelp's active business accounts to increase rapidly, registering an additional 32,000 accounts by the end of the current year. However, we may see a linear decline in the ARPA as we move forward due to increased attention on boosting its customer base. However, for the current year the ARPA will remain around $2,600-$2,800. Therefore, if the company is able to register around 70,000 business accounts, we will see the local advertising segment contribute $189 million in revenue in the current year.3) Partnerships and other services Additionally, Yelp offers a platform for different business houses to offer their daily deals to consumers in the form of promotional offers and discounts. These are generally weekend offers and tend to attract more visitors, especially with the company's user base consisting of a younger generation. Moreover, this segment also allows Yelp's partners, OpenTable and Orbitz, to offer their services to consumers, such as hotel reservations and airline ticket bookings.The revenue from this segment jumped to $7.13 million in 2012 from just $0.32 million in 2009 and will generate revenue of $8.2 million in the current year, which will continue its growth momentum.ValuationLast year, the contributions from Yelp's different segments were:Local advertising ----- 78% Brand ads advertising -----10% Net cash ----- 8% Partnerships and Other services ---- 4%Note: The above mentioned percentages are rounded off.In the current year, I don't foresee any major change in the contribution pattern towards the company's value.The company should generate revenue of approximately $225 million in the current year. With 64.4 million equity shares outstanding, Yelp's revenue per share will be almost $3.50.Further, Yelp will have an estimated $105 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the current year, and therefore cash per equity shareholders will be $1.63.Based on the above calculations, the company's stock price by the end of 2013 should reach to $49.(average sales per share * price to sales multiple) x 0.92 + cash per share * 0.08= (3.50 * 15.20) x .92 + 1.63 * .08= $49.Note:1) The price to sales multiple based on the price for which the stock has traded in the trailing 12 months.2) The above price is calculated on a weighted average basis.Stock price movementYelp's stock price has been rising steadily since the beginning of 2013. Initially, when the company was listed in 2012, it did experience some volatility. However, because of its future growth potential, the investors have shown confidence in the company's business model, and I expect the momentum to continue in 2013. As per the company's value that I calculated above, I expect the stock price to reach $49 by the end of 2013.ConclusionThe growing trend towards online advertisements will certainly provide a platform for Yelp to increase its revenue in the future. However, the larger question remaining is how much of the online advertisement market share can Yelp capture when competing with giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and others. Based on the survey that I cited above, it seems that Yelp is trying hard to increase consumer awareness and to expand in additional markets. In addition, the declining share of yellow pages' print directory segment will prove beneficial to Yelp in the days to come.Further, if Yelp is able to add more than 32,000 active business accounts in the local advertising segment in the current year, we can see upside potential for the company increases. Therefore, the expected share price of $49 could increase further by the end of 2013.The stock is a strong ""buy"" and, even if bought now, can generate a holding period return of approximately 31% by the end of the current year.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1599752,25120,2013-08-02T14:58:33-04:00,,"Investors in Yelp Inc (NYSE:YELP) are reacting with enthusiasm to the company's second-quarter results. There are a lot of promising developments to be found in the report, including very strong revenue growth and rapidly narrowing losses.Yet I remain on the sidelines. The possibility of a take-over remains very real, yet I am worried about the impact of competition if an established technology player starts to compete directly with Yelp.Second Quarter ResultsYelp generated second-quarter revenues of $55.0 million, up 69% on the year before. Revenues rose by a strong 19% in comparison to the first quarter.Net losses more than halved from $2.0 million last year to $0.9 million, or $0.01 per share. In comparison, Yelp reported a $4.8 million loss for the first quarter. Analysts were expecting that Yelp would report losses of $0.04 per share.Adjusted EBITDA rose from $1.6 million last year to $7.8 million.Looking Into The ResultsYelp has seen strong growth across all operating metrics. Cumulative reviews were up by 41% to 42.5 million, while the number of monthly unique visitors rose by 38% to 108 million. The company saw a 62% increase in local business accounts to 51,400.Yelp continues to be very attractive for local businesses. An incredible 89% of all consumers who find a local business on Yelp make a purchase within a week.A Strong Base For The Rest Of The YearBased on the solid second-quarter developments, Yelp is looking with confidence towards the remainder of the year.Third-quarter revenue are projected to come in between $58 and $59 million. This implies that revenues are expected to increase by 61% on the year before, and will increase by 6.5% compared to the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to come in between $7.5 and $8 million. The revenue guidance came in ahead of the consensus estimate of $57.4 million.Full-year revenue are expected to come in between $222 and $224 million. This implies that fourth-quarter revenues could come in between $63 and $64 million, up 54% on the year before. Full-year adjusted EBITDA should come in between $27 and $28 million.Consensus estimates for full-year revenue stood at $219.8 million.ValuationYelp ended its second quarter with $96.8 million in cash and equivalents. The company operates without the assumption of debt, for a solid net cash position.Revenues for the first six months of 2013 came in at $101.2 million, up 68% on the year. Net losses roughly halved to $5.7 million at the same time.Factoring in a 25% jump following the release of the results, shares are trading around $52 per share. This values the company at around $3.35 billion, or its operating assets at $3.25 billion.As such, operating assets of the firm are valued around 15 times 2013's annual revenues and 120 times full year adjusted EBITDA.Given the lack of profitability at the moment, Yelp does not pay a dividend at the moment.Some Historical PerspectiveShares of Yelp were sold to the public back in March of 2012 as the firm and its bankers sold shares at $15 per share. Shares quickly rose towards $25 per share, but have moved in a $15-$30 trading range ever since.In recent months, as Yelp released an upbeat first-quarter earnings report, shares broke upwards through the $30 trading range. Including Thursday's gains, shares are trading around $52 per share, for year-to-date gains of almost 200%.Between 2009 and 2013, Yelp is on track to almost ten-fold its annual revenues towards $220 million. Losses have been increasing in recent years, but losses are expected to fall in 2013.Investment ThesisYelp is making great progress. Revenue growth is impressive, and although growth rates will slow down in the remainder of the year, Yelp will continue to grow at very high rates.Furthermore, Yelp is conquering new markets and unveiling new initiatives to boost engagements, offerings and thereby its revenues and earnings. Key expansion areas include the large market for restaurant bookings after Yelp acquired the online restaurant reservation company SeatMe for $12.7 million to compete with OpenTable. By directing Yelp's huge user base towards these growth markets, Yelp could accelerate its services in the sector.The strong diverse base of advertisers, as Yelp is focused on small businesses, brings great diversification in its revenue streams. Total advertising revenues from local businesses rose by 77%, now making up 81% of total revenues. Promising as well is that an impressive 59% of Yelp's searches are conducted on mobile devices, which generates 40% of total advertising revenues.Just like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Yelp hereby proves that companies can earn advertising revenues from mobile devices and tablets. Yet its reliance on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which drives roughly half of Yelp's traffic, remains a concern, but could be alleviated as more and more users directly find its website and application.All in all, there are a lot of green lights with new initiatives, rapid revenue growth, and losses, which are narrowing rapidly. Shares have more than tripled since going public in spring of 2012. With Yahoo.com (YHOO) being on an aggressive acquisition path, the possibility of a take-out remains very real given the limited market capitalization of the firm.Yet I remain on the sidelines. The stand-alone valuation remains very high despite the positive signals and initiatives. Yet I remain worried about the possibility of a tech giant competing against he firm by building a local review website organically, rather than acquiring Yelp.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1586042,40691,2013-07-30T17:53:53-04:00,,"Over the last few weeks the online dining & reservation space has become increasingly competitive with large consumer favorites including Yelp (NYSE:YELP) positioning for a piece of the action. Up until this point the industry has been dominated by a single firm, OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN) and a number of smaller start up firms looking to make a dent in their own local markets.Earlier this month, Yelp, a global consumer review company announced it would be entering the online ordering space with an acquisition of SeatMe, a small $12.7 million deal. While Yelp has focused attention on driving revenues from online advertising, the street has actively criticized and bet against the future potential of the company, as seen in the most recent short interest data.With the deal, Yelp will be able to leverage its customer base and traffic to build up the start up brand. A little background on SeatMe, the company provides technology solutions to make managing reservations easy and affordable to a restaurants. SeatMe costs less for business and restaurant owners in both set up, ongoing, and per customer fees in comparison to OpenTable. The news of the acquisition comes after Yelp announced plans to offer a direct commerce and ordering platform to the traditional website. The new platform will initially just offer customers the ability reserve, order, and pay for restaurant transactions listed on the website. From what I can tell, the new platform will be similar in functionality and structure to my college favorite, GrubHub. GrubHub provides local deals and ordering functionality for local restaurants and chains. One of the many deals offered is the $5 large Domino's (NYSE:DPZ) pizza, you can't beat that.In the remainder of this short article I would like to look at the relevance of each of these companies using Google search trend data. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) gives users the ability to instantly find the popularity of certain keywords over set periods of time, all the way back to 2004. For the first search I wanted to look the keyword ""Yelp"" on Google:Google is reporting that during the month of July, a score of 100 will be reported, or the highest all time level of interest for the company. Following this high, it is forecasted the company will set yet another high next month before pulling back slightly. The dashed line represents the forecasted interest for the next 12 months, as provided by Google. The funny thing is, the above chart looks eerily similar to that of the share price as of late. While I cannot determine the magnitude between the correlation of revenues and search interest today, I think it is logical to assume there is a positive one as Yelp derives all of its revenues through its online websites. Going forward, I feel the launch of the new platform, during record interest for the company, will provide an interesting and new revenue stream for the company. Let's now take a look at the search interest for the keyword ""SeatMe"" on Google:While the above data is limited and greatly affected by the recent acquisition news, we can still see a clear trend prior to the drastic spike upwards. I will be watching this data to see if the level of interest remains in an upward trend excluding the most recent spike. Lastly, let's take a look at the keyword ""OpenTable"" on Google:While off the highs earlier in the year, the search interest data has stayed in an uptrend over the last decade. Over the coming months it will be interesting to see if the recent upswing in competition will have an affect on the data.ConclusionOnline dining is getting hot, a number of smaller competitors and larger players alike are getting involved within the industry. Using search engine data we can see the strength within the Yelp and SeatMe brands. Over the course of the year Yelp will be looking to expand the number of offerings on the new platform to include services other than dining. Who knows, one day Yelp could be the one stop shop for reviews, reservations, booking, and transacting. I plan on giving updates on this data in the months ahead either in article form, or on my blog. You can view the search engine data for yourself here!Source: Google provided all of the search interest data.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1608902,24278,2013-08-06T14:12:25-04:00,,"Is YELP's Mobile Growth at Risk?Last week, Yelp, Inc. (NYSE:YELP) posted an impressive second quarter 2013 earnings report showing year over year revenue growth of 69% to $55 million with adjusted EBITDA of $7.8 million. Average monthly unique visitors grew 38% year over year to 108 million and active local business accounts grew 62% to approximately 51,400.Yelp is a website founded in 2004 that connects people with local businesses. Yelp considers itself ""the leading local guide for real word-of-mouth on everything from boutiques and mechanics to restaurants and dentists."" This word-of-mouth content is provided by users (affectionately referred to as Yelpers by Yelp management) who have written more than 42.5 million local reviews on various businesses providing valuable marketing services to thousands of businesses.Since Yelp's earnings report on July 31, the stock has soared 36% ($41.80 to last Friday's close of $57.02). This two-day gain increases Yelp's year to date stock performance to +302% ($18.85 to $57.02) making it one of the hottest stock performers in the market for 2013.These gains are impressive and the company is guiding for their growth to sustain itself for the full year of 2013. Yelp also raised full year revenue guidance to $224 million, representing 62% year over year growth on adjusted EBITDA of $28 million.Based on this performance, Yelp is beginning to catch the attention of financial market news heavyweights like Jim Cramer of CNBC. In a show last week highlighting Yelp, he speculated that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) should consider buying Yelp for $75/share to enhance its social and mobile strategy.For investors holding positions in Yelp this year and over the most recent trading days, congratulations on your stellar gains. With the recent news of Yelp's growth, many opportunistic investors will likely join you as new Yelp shareholders in hopes that Jim Cramer's $75/share buyout valuation prediction does come true.But there is another facet of the Yelp story that investors may not be aware of yet. If you were doing responsible due diligence of reading the company's most recent 10-Q quarterly financial filing (August 2, 2013), you would not know this fact. If you were reading Yelp's official press releases, you would not know of this fact. And, if you listened to the company's most recent earnings conference call (July 31, 2013), you would not know of this fact.Therefore, this article seeks to share a relatively unknown and hugely important fact, which could potentially impact the future earnings power of Yelp in one of its fastest growing segments, mobile advertising.Patent Infringement Lawsuit Filed Against YELP by Blue CalypsoOn October 17, 2012, Yelp was named in a complaint filed by Blue Calypso Inc. (OTCPK:BCYP) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas for allegedly infringing on two of its patents (7,664,516 and 8,155,679). The patents cover Blue Calypso's proprietary system for peer-to-peer advertising on mobile devices.Not only is Blue Calypso confident that Yelp's mobile growth is fueled by their patented technology, they have also filed nearly identical patent infringement suits against social marketing heavyweights Groupon, Inc. (NASDAQ:GRPN), Living Social, IZEA (NASDAQ:IZEA), MyLikes, and Foursquare.If Blue Calypso's complaint has merit, its intellectual property may very well be driving the highest growth segment of Yelp's operations - the increasing use of mobile devices for searches and ad revenue. Yelp mobile now represents 40% of their ad sales and approximately 59% of all Yelp searches were on mobile devices.Recent Development Negatively Impacting YELPSince October 2012, the cases have slowly worked their way through the U.S. District Court. But the last two weeks have seen major developments adversely impacting defendants like Yelp.In an unexpected order (available at pacer.gov) by U.S. District Court Judge Michael Schneider on July 19, 2013, the court consolidated all five defendants (Groupon, IZEA, Yelp, Foursquare, MyLikes) into the one lead case, ""Blue Calypso, Inc. v. Groupon, Inc."" for all pretrial purposes, including discovery and claim construction. Therefore, instead of having five separate cases, he ordered one lead case with Blue Calypso as the plaintiff against the five defendants. This is good news for Blue Calypso and bad news for the defendants including Yelp. With this order, the judge ruled that all motions filed prior to consolidation (July 19) must be refiled in the lead case to be considered by the court. In short, the judge closed Yelp's existing, nine-month-old case and all the work filed to date and added Yelp to the existing lead case titled ""Blue Calypso, Inc. v. Groupon, Inc.""Therefore, Yelp (and the other defendants) must now basically start from scratch in their effort to defend against the patent infringement suit brought by Blue Calypso. While this may just seem like an unwelcome delay and costly inconvenience for Yelp as they refile what had been previously filed, what they are now facing regarding the plaintiff is quite different. In this case reset, Yelp must now deal with the reality that they are now battling against a much stronger plaintiff (Blue Calypso) than they argued against in their initial filings for two reasons.Blue Calypso's Strengthened Position As PlaintiffFirst, over the last 90 days, Blue Calypso has received three new patents (Patent numbers 8,438,055; 8,452,646; 8,457,670) to further solidify their case of patent infringement. With this new firepower in their arsenal, Blue Calypso amended and strengthened their 2012-filed initial complaints against Yelp and the other four defendants on June 13, 2013. Now that the judge has consolidated the cases, defendants must now determine whether they will continue in court against a much stronger plaintiff or settle with Blue Calypso.Secondly, the major news of last week was that the first of the five defendants, MyLikes, decided to settle with Blue Calypso instead of proceeding with this case post-consolidation order and post the issuance of Blue Calypso's three new patents. In the settlement announced on July 25, 2013, MyLikes has agreed to pay Blue Calypso the equivalent of a 3.5% royalty for the use of Blue Calypso patents.Blue Calypso CEO Bill Ogle said in the settlement announcement,For background, MyLikes is a private company and considers its business ""the largest content and social advertising platform in the world."" Founded and run by two former Google stars (Bindu Reddy and Arvind Sundararajan), the company has attracted the funding and involvement of a team of highly respected angel and venture capital investors including Vinod Khosla (Khosla Ventures), Paul Buchheit (Gmail Creator), Joe Kraus, Georges Harik, Sanjeev Singh, David Hirsch, Metamorphic Ventures, XG Ventures, Deepchand Nishar and Aydin Senkut.As a private company, public financial information on MyLikes is not available. But with their broad platform reach, top technical talent, and heavily funded advisors, MyLikes's royalty payments to Blue Calypso could become very valuable as the company continues to expand in this high growth market of word-of-mouth marketing.With this strong, credible validation of the Blue Calypso patents, Yelp and the other defendants must assess anew whether to push ahead into a lengthy and costly litigation season with Blue Calypso or to settle out of court with a payment or a licensing deal.Estimated Yelp Settlement Based on MyLikes Licensing Deal MetricsWithout annual revenue information for MyLikes, it is impossible to calculate the estimated value of their settled 3.5% royalty deal over the 13-year lifespan (valid until December 14, 2026) of Blue Calypso's patents.But we can estimate a calculation of what a 3.5% royalty would cost Yelp over the course of 13 years based on their 2013 revenue guidance of $224 million (of which approximately 40% or $89 million will be from mobile ads). If we were to conservatively assume that Yelp would grow revenue at only a 10% annual rate over the next 13 years, mobile ad share of revenue would stay at 40%, and that Blue Calypso's patents are needed to generate Yelp's mobile ad revenue, a 3.5% royalty rate would cost Yelp approximately $84 million over 13 years in royalty payments.ConclusionWhile Yelp's recent earnings report has caused investors to bid up shares to reach +300% year to date gains, many have no idea of the risk involved in a relatively unknown, high stakes litigation battle, which could directly impact Yelp's robust, mobile growth.The risk to Yelp shareholders if a settlement or royalty deal happens is that current and future revenue will be diminished based on the settlement terms with Blue Calypso until the patents expire in 2026. Conversely, Yelp may ultimately be successful in a jury trial verdict in fending off this patent infringement complaint. But, the cost and distraction of litigation over the next 18 months will come at a price to Yelp's bottom line and performance. The key Markman Hearing is scheduled for February 5, 2014, and the pretrial conference is scheduled for October 6, 2014, setting the stage for a jury trial in Q4 2014.We will have to wait and see what Yelp decides to do - mitigate the risk of a jury trial by negotiating a settlement with Blue Calypso following fellow defendant MyLikes calculated decision last week or let the jury decide their fate. We do know that Yelp has a history of settling out of court for cash awards in previous suits against them as recently evidenced by a March 2011 suit by former employees, which resulted in a cash award of approximately $800,000 paid by Yelp to the plaintiffs in the first quarter of 2013.Going forward, I would caution investors to not expect a play by play via press releases from Yelp's Investor Relations department. The best place to watch the legal action as it happens is by following the flow of court business via pacer.gov by referencing ""cause number 6:12-cv-486, Blue Calypso, Inc. v. Groupon, Inc.""I am of strong conviction that MyLikes is likely not the first and only defendant to settle out of court with Blue Calypso instead of pressing their luck with individual jury awards for damages that could reach $84 million (in the case of Yelp) and likely much more with the largest defendant, Groupon, based on their annual revenue of over $2 billion, or 10X that of Yelp.Disclosure: I am long OTCPK:BCYP.

1601972,34541,2013-08-03T04:02:35-04:00,,"Well, now we just may know where Google's ad revenue went: Yelp and Facebook.Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) missed Wall Street's consensus for reasons attributed to a decrease in the price of mobile ad revenues. A recent Forbes column by Contributor Robert Hof indicated that mobile ads were already 40% less than prices for ads served on desktop computers and his opinion as to why they continue to decline may be that Google is offering more of them, which could be pushing the prices down as a corollary.Conjecture that was not put forward in Mr. Hof's column was that advertisers have significant options outside of the Google universe of mobile ads such as those being sold through Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and clearly companies like Yelp (NYSE:YELP). I believe this is a blip for Google with its diversified portfolio and increased emphasis on non-ad related revenues for the future. However, for younger and rapidly growing companies like Yelp with much smaller market caps, Google's loss in revenue from this segment will be their gain.Taking a look at Yelp's Q2 Earnings Call transcript, Jeremy Stoppelman - Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer and Director stated:Google's Q2 net revenue, which excludes payments to ad partners, was $11.1 billion while analysts had expected net revenue of $11.33 billion, excluding the cost of stock options.Facebook announced $1.81 billion in revenue for the company's second quarter of 2013, compared to analyst estimates of $1.62 billion in revenue.Although anecdotal, it is interesting to note that Google missed expectations by a couple hundred million, while Facebook and Yelp exceeded by a combined dollar figure that is close to difference between Wall Street's expectation for Google and their reported number.It appears that mobile may be leveling the playing field between companies like Facebook and Yelp versus the powerhouse Google. The strength of Google Search has been based upon the fact that when people conduct a search, they are often looking specifically for information on a product or service and are often looking to make a purchase. For mobile, which is growing thanks to the use of smartphones, Google's traditional advantage may be mitigated and hence make the eyeballs of Facebook and Yelp users more attractive depending upon the nature of the product or service being advertised.If a consumer is considering a larger purchase, they might not be inclined to research it on Google while mobile. Interestingly, Yelp's CEO Stoppelman also said in their conference call: ""in the second quarter, a study recommissioned by Nielsen found that when consumers find a local business on Yelp, 89% make a purchase within a week.""That is a high conversion rate and it makes sense that it would be so given the often spontaneous way that consumers make purchase decisions when deciding on a restaurant and various forms of entertainment. Hence, mobile may be regarded as Google's ""Achilles' heel"" so to speak for certain specialized genres. It just so happens that those genres are a combined trillion plus global segment of the economy.We have seen what has happened to companies that have achieved ""critical mass"" in other industries such as travel. What kind of numbers could we eventually be talking about as Yelp continues to grow? Priceline.com (PCLN) now commands a market cap of near $46 billion.When people go to Priceline.com they are also usually looking to buy in the very near future. Travel is more expensive but people travel less frequently than they go to a restaurant or buy movie tickets. Travel is an enormous market but the revenue could be made up for in volume by comparison.According to the National Restaurant Association's website, the restaurant-industry sales projected for 2013 amounts to $660.5 billion.According to the ustravel.org website, annual spending on the travel industry amounts to approximately $855 billion, although $201 billion of that includes spending on restaurants (patronized during traveling). Subsequently, although many Yelp reviews are written by ""locals"", Yelp is a great source of restaurant recommendations, especially while the consumer is in an area with which the consumer has less familiarity.Another $89 billion of the annual $850 billion is attributed to recreation/amusement, which is another segment for which Yelp is commonly used. As Mr. Stoppelman aptly put it during the call ""...this includes the opportunity to buy movie tickets, print coupons or link the promotions on their sites.""We all know that entertainment is an enormous industry and globally it is estimated to be over a $2 trillion industry. Media revenues in the US are estimated to reach $555 billion by 2015.Considering that Yelp is doing well in their global expansion and that leisure and entertainment is their niche, the future looks bright for Yelp. It is not implausible by any stretch of the imagination that by capturing just a small percentage of those total revenues, Yelp could reach Priceline.com type revenues and valuation as they achieve ""critical mass"", especially with those impressive conversion rates.If Yelp could capture 1% of the annual restaurant industry alone (totally excluding all other entertainment), that would put their annual revenue at double the current market cap of just under $3 billion.The reason why the vast majority of investors kick themselves because they missed the grand-slam investment opportunities in the early stages - is because they heed the advice of Wall Street analysts (like the one at UBS who downgraded Yelp) and they miss the big picture. How far a company's stock rose and how fast has nothing to do with value or future potential. One cannot pinpoint an exact value for a rapidly growing company nor will they pinpoint precise earnings and profit margins while looking 5 years into the future. They can however anticipate an accurate ballpark, but only if they have a rough idea of what they are dealing with in a company and industry.On that note, I want to end with a succinct quote by CNBC's Jim Cramer because he is onto something with Yelp and seems to see the proverbial forest through the trees. Cramer said that ""Yelp is winning in a number of different ways. First, as more and more people use the service, it becomes harder and harder for businesses of all types not to be on the service. And as more and more businesses get listed, well, that only drives more people to the site in a virtuous circle.""One area in which I disagree with Cramer is in his earlier ""tweet"" in which he contended that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) should ""acquire Yelp for $75 per share."" If there is to be an acquisition, it would justify one hefty premium over the current market cap. I think if any company acquired Yelp it would be Google and secondly, since Yelp seems to be well aware of what they are stepping in, they would be giving it away at $75 per share.I do not make such bold claims often but the writing is on the wall with this one. The last time I made such a claim I stated that Under Armour, then at a market cap of $700 million, would never sell to Nike for less than $5 billion.I do not have an exact price target but because of their position in the industry, the size of the industries in which they are at the beginning stages of dominating and their competence in executing their business plan - I believe that Yelp will conservatively command a valuation of $8-$10 billion and they wouldn't be giving it away for anything less if there were to be an acquisition.Disclosure: I am long FB, YELP.

Although Yelp has been successful in expanding its local ads business by inorganic and organic route, it still needs to monetize its properties more effectively to increase its overall revenues. While Yelp has been using display ads to monetize its websites, it is in the process of monetizing its mobile platform for revenues. In this article we explore the mobile ads opportunity and how Yelp can monetize its mobile platform through display ads.Mobile Ads – Opportunities GaloreAccording to the Internet advertising Bureau [IAB], Internet advertising experienced a double-digit growth in 2012, for a record $37 billion in revenues [IAB: Mobile Ads Captured 9% Of Online Ad Spend In 2012, April 16 2013, www.adexchanger.com]. Mobile ads led this growth as revenues grew by 9% to $3.4 billion in 2012. Research firm Forrester predicts that ad spend on smart mobile devices (SMDs) will represent 29% of the total online ad spend in the U.S. by 2018. Additionally, Gartner has predicted that worldwide mobile ad revenue will exceed $11 billion in 2013, and that the growth rate for ad revenue will exceed 400% during 2011-2016. (Gartner Worldwide Mobile Advertising Revenue, January 17 2013, www.gartner.com)The drivers behind this explosive growth in mobile ads spend are:Mobile Monetization Is Key For Yelp’s GrowthWith rapid growth in mobile advertising revenues due to higher penetration and use of SMDs by consumers and the use of more personalized and location-based advertising by mobile advertisers, Yelp can monetize its mobile platform as it has one of the largest listings of local ads. Yelp’s brand ads division is the second largest division and makes up ~11% of Yelp’s estimated value.Over the past year this division has grown at a robust rate of over 16% from $17 million in FY11 to $21 million in FY12. One of the key contributors to this growth is the adoption of Yelps’ mobile platform and its mobile app. Yelp reported that 30% of its 102 million unique visitors (~10 million monthly unique mobile users) used its mobile devices for accessing its services in Q1FY13.We currently project that Yelp’s monthly unique visitor will increase from 86 million in 2012 to over 120 million by the end of 2013. Assuming that 30% of unique visitors are mobile users, we have accounted for $8 million in search ads revenue from mobile in FY13.Yelp reported that 36% of its ad impressions were served on mobile devices in Q1 FY13, and its mobile penetration is on the rise as almost 45% of all Yelp’s searches were via mobile. With the mobile app now running display ads, this is likely to become a major revenue driver for Yelp’s brand ads division. Yelp can monetize its mobile platform using display ads as 36 million (30% of expected FY13 unique visitors) monthly unique users can generate 2.19 billion page views based on a conservative estimate of 300 page views per month per user. These 2.19 billion page views could generate at least $3.4 million in revenues for Yelp in 2013, if it can charge the current display ads rate of $1.50 per thousand impressions (NYSE:RPM) to advertisers. However there could be meaningful upside to our forecast if Yelp is able to charge higher ad rates for mobile users, the number of page views per month is higher or if more users visit the site than we currently anticipate.We currently have a $19 Trefis price estimate for Yelp, which stands nearly 35% below its market price.Disclosure: No positions"

1408971,23479,2013-05-07T11:46:01-04:00,,"Yelp's (NYSE:YELP) results showed the effect of rapid expansion as revenue grew 68% y-o-y to $46.13 million in Q1. Apart from launching in Germany and the U.K. (through Qype acquisition), Yelp also expanded its presence to New Zealand, marking its entry into Asia-Pacific region. Yelp continued to report a net loss of $4.8 million in Q1 CY13, however, this is substantial improvement, as net loss decreased by 51% y-o-y from $9.83 million in Q1 CY12In Q1 CY13,Yelp reported 42% growth in cumulative reviews to 39 million and 43% increase in average unique monthly visitors to 102 million. Active local business accounts also increased by 63% y-o-y to approximately 45,000.After this quarter's earnings announcement, our price estimate for Yelp has increased from $16 to $19.36, but it still remains substantially below the current market price. Overall, we are encouraged by Yelp's results and think that the business seems to be on a growth path, but we would start believing in a substantially higher Yelp valuation if the company can sustain a higher growth rate in its local advertising segment, which is worth 78% of its total value.The local ads division contributes ~80% to Yelp's revenue and makes up 78% of Yelp's estimated value. One of the primary drivers for the local ads division is the number of active business accounts on Yelp. During Q1 CY13, active local business accounts increased by 63% y-o-y, to approximately 45,000. The primary reasons for growth in this driver are Yelp's international expansion efforts and increase in cumulative reviews on the Yelp site, which increases its appeal to advertisers and users alike.In the past few quarters, Yelp has been on an international expansion spree through organic and inorganic routes. In Q1, Yelp opened its operations in New Zealand and it continued to integrate Qype business into its platform, which resulted in an increase in active business accounts. We expect this trend to continue and the number of active business accounts on Yelp to increase from 40,000 in 2012 to over 181,000 by the end of our forecast period. However, we believe that the market is estimating an even higher growth rate, and thus, a higher valuation for Yelp.Mobile Monetization Beats Brand AdsThe brand ads division is the second largest division and makes up ~11% of Yelp's estimated value. In Q1 CY13, brand ads revenue grew 19% y-o-y to $4.8 million. One of the key contributors to this growth is the adoption Yelps' mobile platform and its mobile app. Yelp's mobile app continued to gain traction and had an install base of approximately 10 million devices in Q1. Yelp reported that 30% of its 102 million unique visitors (~10 million monthly unique mobile users) used its mobile devices for accessing its services. Yelp is ""rapidly becoming a de facto search engine"" as users prefer Yelp over other search options when it comes to reviews.In our pre-earnings article, we had argued that Yelp should look to monetize its mobile platform by adding display ads to its repertoire. (See: Yelp's Mobile Monetization And International Growth Are Keys To Earnings) In Q1, the company launched display ads on its mobile app for the first time, and we believe that this is a right step towards monetizing its mobile platform. Yelp continues to add new display advertisers such as Taco Bell, InterContinental Hotels and MillerCoors for its brand ads division.It also beefed up its local search business by partnering with Bing to show up on local business pages. Yelp reported that 36% of its ads impression were served on mobile devices. Yelp's mobile penetration is on the rise and almost 45% of all Yelp's searches were via mobile. With the mobile app now running display ads, this is likely to become a major revenue driver for Yelp's Brand ads division.

1473031,21035,2013-05-31T07:44:52-04:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is an online firm that generates revenues through local advertisements. During the quarter ended March 2013, the Yelp website was used by 102.1 million unique visitors and 9.9 million unique mobile users on a monthly average basis. As per its Q1 2013 Form 10Q, the company is active in 54 Yelp markets in U.S. and 46 Yelp markets internationally.On the face of it, Yelp seems to be growing at a robust pace. However, I am quite skeptical about Yelp's future due to the following reasons.1. Yelp's business model is flawed and is going to affect its long-term prospects.2. The acquisition of Qype will lead to a significant write-off in the short term.1. Flawed business model - The reliability of the reviews posted on Yelp is questionable, since the identity of the reviewer cannot be confirmed. Sites like freelancer.com help companies hire freelancers to write good user reviews for its products. There are thousands of projects posted on freelancer.com by local businesses that ask freelancers to generate ""user reviews"" which may not be based on authentic experience. Also, friends of businesses may post favorable reviews of its products/services and poor reviews of the competitors' products. Businesses engaging in such practices may create unreliable reviews thereby driving the visitor traffic away. Yelp, however, claims that it has programs to ensure the authenticity of reviews.2. Qype acquisitionIn the short term, the acquisition of Qype may create significant write-offs and hurt Yelp's balance sheet.Yelp has raised $96 million from its IPO. It acquired Qype in October 2012 for $47.6 million to expand internationally. Qype had total assets of only $4.5 million and current liabilities of 6.4 million. Its revenues were only $8 million with a net loss of $4 million. In fact, the shareholders of Qype had to inject additional cash through a loan of $8.2 million to ensure Qype's survival. But this acquisition somehow enabled Yelp to increase synergies and raise the goodwill of the combined entity by $43.83 million. It is interesting to note that prior to the acquisition, Qype's goodwill was only $243,000 and Yelp's balance sheet showed zero goodwill. But post acquisition, Yelp registered a goodwill of $43.5 million on its balance sheet. How did it gain goodwill of $43.5 million? (Source)The acquisition of Qype was also supposed to increase the Yelp's footprint in Europe and other strategic markets such as Brazil and Turkey. However, Form 10K (December 2012) shows that Yelp generated only 2.2% of revenues in 2012 from international locations. This translates to $3.025 million. Yelp had also stated in its Form 10Q (Q3 2012) that most of its revenues YTD came from within U.S. Since Qype was acquired in October 2012, one can make an educated guess that the international revenues came in during the 4th quarter.The 4th quarter revenues were $41.1 million (Annual revenues of $137.5 million - Q3 2012 YTD revenues of $96.4 million). This implies that the international revenues accounted for 7.36% of the total revenues in the 4th quarter ending December 2012. To determine the value of this acquisition one should compare this figure with Q1 2013.The latest 10Q (Mar 2013) states that:This translates to 6% of $46.1 million = $2.766 million. While Yelp increased its revenues from $41.1 million to $46.1 million sequentially, the international revenues decreased from 7.36% to 6% of the quarterly revenues. Even in absolute terms, the international revenues decreased from $3.02 million to $2.766 million.The acquisition of Qype has not created the synergy that Yelp expected. In fact, the goodwill of the company has taken a minor hit from $48.6 million in Dec 2012 to $45.993 million in Mar 2013.Yelp reviews the value of its goodwill in the third quarter of the fiscal year. I expect a big write-off on the goodwill in the coming quarters, and this charge is likely to affect its future earnings. Since it will be a one-time charge, no one will probably notice?!Conclusion:I don't know why Yelp acquired Qype. But I don't want to find out the consequences of the acquisition by being a Yelp shareholder.Sources: Form 10ks and Form 10QsDisclosure: I am short YELP.

1406981,48721,2013-05-06T17:29:19-04:00,,"Allow me to preface this short thesis by saying that I actually like YELP quite a bit. I believe it is a useful service in many ways. My wife and I use Yelp to find a new restaurant almost weekly and it usually steers us somewhere enjoyable. In spite of my admiration for some of Yelp's services, it is impossible to justify its 1.95B market cap and 12x sales multiple. Yelp is operating on a flawed business model that will never achieve the growth anticipated by Wall Street.(Note: I will be referring to the most recent 10-k, Yelp's Q1-13 informational slides, and the Q1-13 8-k earnings report extensively.) The macro view of the short thesis is contained in the following points, listed in order of importance:1. Yelp's mom-and-pop customer base doesn't lend itself to scalability. Large chain restaurants and chain shopping locations generally don't advertise on Yelp (everyone knows what to expect from their neighborhood McDonald's), meaning mom and pop shops, or local businesses, as Yelp likes to call them, contribute the lion's share of revenue. The most recent earnings release shows that local businesses account for 86% of Yelp's revenue. This is a major flaw in Yelp's business model because price sensitive mom and pops don't have near the advertising budgets of larger chains and are more prone to going out of business, or terminating an advertising contract for budget reasons. Yelp can't rely on large, stable customers giving them lucrative long term contracts. Instead, it must acquire each individual customer, typically a one off. A Yelp salesman must go to each store and pick them off one-by-one, implying a high acquisition cost. Indeed, we see in 2011 that 1 dollar of sales/marketing resulted in 1.60 dollars of additional revenue. In 2012 and Q1-13 the ratio stayed exactly the same.This high acquisition cost would be understandable for a company in its incubation period, but Yelp has been operating for ten years and has yet to see positive economies of scale. There is no reason to believe that Yelp will ever experience economies of scale given the high acquisition cost and highly volatile nature of Yelp's customer base.Compounding the issue is the fact that Yelp doesn't provide a substantial value proposition to build a solid revenue base. For businesses, Yelp's value is in its reviews. Positive reviews generate interest in the business while negative reviews hurt the business. Certainly having your company appear near the top of a search list helps, but in the end it is the reviews that drive customers to a business. The point here is that Yelp's value proposition is in its reviews, not paid advertising, the problem of course being that a business gets reviews on Yelp for free. Businesses getting the majority of Yelp's value for free illustrates the weakness in Yelp's future revenue potential. Reviews bring up another issue that should be noted. As stated previously, the reviews are the value driver of Yelp. Unfortunately, user generated review growth began decelerating at the end of Q4-11 and has continued through Q4-12. The following chart shows the deceleration over the last five quarters:The main value driver of Yelp has already started its deceleration process, further diminishing the future value of Yelp.2. Yelp has already established itself in the premium markets, and its service clearly has substantially more value in a city like New York than in an Indianapolis. Indianapolis, as opposed to NY, has far less need for Yelp for a number of reasons. First, there is less population turnover. Someone who has lived in a city for several years has less of a need for Yelp's services than someone who moves into a new city. Likewise, someone who has lived in one place for a while has established eating and shopping habits and is less likely to seek a new restaurant on Yelp. Second, the area is more spread out, meaning less dining options around an individual, meaning less need for a Yelp type service. If I only have three Mexican restaurants in my city (think Salt Lake City) I have likely tried most of them or at least heard of them, so why do I need to research Mexican restaurants on Yelp? Third, the income per person is lower than a NY or SF, implying Yelp users in an Indianapolis are less attractive to advertisers. This is evidenced by the revenue/unique visitor metric, which in 2011 was around one dollar and remained the same in 2012, and then decreased in Q1-13 in spite of the more established cohorts increasing efficiency as they reach maturity.This chart represents cohort data from the 2012 10K:Here we see just how much more valuable those premium markets are to Yelp. The NY, SF, cohort cities (2005-2006) generate 4x as much revenue as the San Diego, San Jose, cohort cities (2007-2008). Additionally, the San Jose, San Diego cohort cities generate 6x the newest cohort cities (2009-2010). Certainly some of this discrepancy is due to the maturation of the oldest cohort, but maturation can't explain this large of a discrepancy. The most recent earnings release reiterated this point, with the first cohort accounting for half of their local ad revenue and the newest cohort accounting for 1/10 of the first. The lack of valuable undeveloped markets further shows that Yelp's future growth opportunities are limited.3. Yelp faces asymmetrical supply-demand. There is essentially unlimited competition for advertising revenue. Comparatively, the marginal cost of adding an advertiser is close to zero for most internet advertisers, meaning companies can and will lower prices to attract marginal advertising. In contrast, mom and pops are extremely price sensitive. More often than not, they choose the cheaper of two options unless there is a significant value proposition, which Yelp doesn't offer (generally speaking, many Yelp customers are actually dissatisfied with the website. Just look at Yelp's reviews on… Yelp). Yelp doesn't have the ability to command a premium for advertising space, implying, again, compressed margins and limited growth opportunity. Extremely successful growth companies have a significant value proposition that others can't replicate. Think Microsoft Windows, Intel's microchip, Apple's I-phone, Facebook, etc… These products were revolutionary and couldn't/can't be duplicated, which explains their incredible growth. Yelp doesn't offer a significantly differentiated product with significant value added. It is just another online advertiser among thousands of others. If anything, as it has already shown, Yelp will experience tight margins akin to a commodity or utility company.4. Unique visitor growth is decelerating. Unique visitors, by definition, drive advertising revenue. No one would want to advertise on Yelp if people didn't visit the website. If unique visitor growth decelerates, then it stands to reason that advertising revenue decelerates with it, perhaps not immediately, but certainly over time. From Q4-11 to Q1-12, average monthly unique visitors grew by 8.5%. Q1-12 to Q2-12, it grew 9.6%. Q2-12 to Q3-12, growth was 6.6%. Lastly, in Q3-12 to Q4-12 it grew 3%. This is clearly not the high growth company we are pitched by Wall St. analysts.As a note, these numbers and the chart exclude the most recent quarter unique visitors for a very good reason. Unique visitors jumped to 102mm, according to Yelp. This represents an 18% jump from the previous quarter. An 18% jump is just too hard to believe when the trend is so clear from the above statistics. When asked about the drivers of this incredible jump during the recent earnings call, management simply said, ""We don't know of anything in particular that caused the acceleration."" I'll go ahead and speculate for the management on what event could cause this increase: Q4-12 was the release of Yelp's mobile app. Over 30% of Yelp's traffic came from this app in Q1-13 and my speculation is that Yelp is double-counting users due to the mobile app. For instance, a user who typically uses Yelp on their computer begins using the mobile app. Say in January they visit it on the PC. They visit Yelp again on the PC in February. This is only one unique visitor, but as soon as they visit Yelp on their phone they become two unique visitors. This is just speculation, but I believe that the unique visitor growth isn't reflecting 18% more people visiting the website, just some visiting on the PC and mobile app. The lack of cumulative reviews acceleration suggests the unique visitor growth isn't meaningful as well. I'm not accusing Yelp's management of being outright liars; they very well could believe they miraculously achieved 18% visitor growth without a reason. But I am saying this metric is misleading and should have been qualified by management.The argument could be made that unique visitor growth is not necessary to drive revenue growth. Yelp could become more efficient, expand margins, maintain a loyal customer base, and generally become more profitable. Unfortunately, the preceding points in this thesis make it fairly clear that the opposite will happen - margins will compress further, there will continue to be customer churn, Yelp won't be able to command a premium for their service, etc… The numbers also disprove the notion. The stagnant revenue to sales expense and revenue to unique visitor metrics show a lack of scaling efficiencies in Yelp's business. Yelp has also operated at a significant EPS loss for its entire existence, so it's tough to see how it could transform into a cash cow. The following chart shows Yelp's GAAP EPS for each of the last five quarters.Q1-13 Earnings:The most recent earnings release and subsequent short squeeze might have some worried that they are catching the proverbial ""falling knife"" by going short. This shouldn't be the case because, as I'll demonstrate, the most recent earnings release is nothing extraordinary and doesn't refute any of the arguments previously made in this thesis.The reason the stock price has rapidly risen the past day or two is purely due to a short squeeze. The revenue growth was admittedly solid, but not outstanding. From Q4-12 to Q1-13, revenue growth was 12%, which is actually lower than the 13% from Q3-12 to Q4-12, and substantially lower than the 19% from Q1-12 to Q2-12.This 5mm in revenue growth was, of course, accompanied by a 3mm increase in sales and marketing. Indeed, all operating margins saw little improvement when common sized against revenue.Again, where is the scalability of this business model if revenue growth has a near 1.5:1 relationship with sales and marketing growth, and no meaningful margin improvements anywhere else?Mobile App and International Growth:There is currently a lot of hype regarding the mobile app and international opportunities as big growth catalysts. I just have two quick comments on this. First, mobile app usage is necessarily bad for Yelp. Internet advertisers are struggling to figure out how to monetize mobile apps (Facebook, anyone?), so if anything, increased mobile app usage just further devalues Yelp. Second, international growth having a meaningful impact on earnings is a dream. Sure, they might be able to generate revenue growth through international expansion, but the fact is that Yelp's revenue growth is only due to increased expenses and not because of scalability. If anything, expenses will only be greater in international markets and Yelp will see less return on investment than in the US/Canada.Valuation:Trying to come up with a precise number on what a company like Yelp is worth is near impossible, so I won't try. If Yelp does ever become profitable, I believe the argument I've made refutes the idea that it is a high growth company worthy of its insane 12.3x price to sales multiple. To put this multiple in perspective, using the 2012 year end revenue, if Yelp increased revenue 15% every quarter for three years it would still trade at a 4x price to sales multiple. Considering the dearth of growth opportunity available to Yelp, I wouldn't take that bet. This is likely a mute point though considering Yelp will probably not achieve profitability due to the high acquisition costs and customer churn.Here is what I consider the most bullish scenario for Yelp: They realize there is limited growth with their current business model and decide to focus on their established cohorts. They start to see a loyal customer base develop (not likely because of reasons mentioned previously), become more efficient operationally, and are able to cut back on sales and marketing (very unlikely due to the low quality of Yelp's cash stream and constant need for new customers). In this scenario, a decent comparison of value would be HomeAdvisor.com.HomeAdvisor is certainly not a perfect comparison, for obvious reasons (HomeAdvisor is more of a niche and Yelp has much more scope being the biggest difference), but they have similar business models (both are free review sites that attract business advertising). In any case, it gives us some idea of what Yelp should be worth in a best case scenario. HomeAdvisors's valuation can actually be found in a Citron report on Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI). HomeAdvisors.com is valued at 280mm by Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and 320mm by Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB). I should also mention that HomeAdvisors.com is actually profitable, and it only commands a 7x EBITDA multiple. Since Yelp doesn't have positive EBITDA, a meaningful valuation still can't be created, but the fact that a comparable company that is generating profit is only valued at an average of 300mm just shows how ridiculous Yelp's 2b market cap is. If we postulate that Yelp can eventually achieve twice the EBITDA of HomeAdvisors, then it is still only worth 600mm, or around 10$/share. Again, this is an extremely rough back of the envelope calculation, but it shows how outlandish the 2b dollar valuation is.Short term prospects/future catalysts:Right now is about as perfect an opportunity to open a short position as you can get. The short squeeze has artificially increased the price to an unsustainable level in the very short term. Once things calm down and shorts stop covering, the stock is basically guaranteed at least a 5% drop.Long term, the clear catalyst is a deceleration in top-line revenue growth. Internet companies like Yelp are purely valued by Wall Street based on revenue growth. If there is any deceleration in revenue growth, watch out below. I believe there will be a deceleration in Q2, or Q3 of this year because of the deceleration across Yelp's other meaningful metrics. At some point, the deterioration in the other metrics will be reflected in revenue growth. A more intangible catalyst is the Wall Street hype decreasing. As Yelp gets further away from its IPO date it becomes less and less of a growth story, the Wall Street hype will cool down in the coming months, putting further downward pressure on Yelp's price.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in YELP over the next 72 hours.

1384771,23479,2013-04-30T13:04:14-04:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP)  will announce its earnings for Q1 2013 on May 1. The company announced  its Q4 CY 2012 results in February and reported a solid 65% year-over-year jump in  net revenues to $41.2 million. Cumulative reviews grew 45% year over year to  more than 36 million, with average unique monthly visitors growing by  31% to 86 million. Active local business accounts grew 68% year over year, to  approximately 40,000.The company derives a major portion of its revenue from local  advertising and brand advertising, and it also dabbles in auxiliary  services like deals, reservations and bookings for additional revenue.  During upcoming earnings call, we'll look at how mobile usage continues  to grow and how company plans to monetize its growing mobile platform.  Moreover, Yelp announced plans to expand outside of the U.S., and we  will be on the lookout for any key takeaways regarding this expansion  process.Mobile Monetization Is Key for Yelp's GrowthAt a recent conference, Yelp  reported that 46% of its search queries originated from its mobile app.  Considering that more web traffic is originating from mobile devices, Yelp's  strategy to monetize its mobile platform is critical for the long term  success of the company. Yelp currently has over 8.2 million monthly  unique mobile users, and has integrated its services into Siri and the  new Apple Maps application on iOS 6. Yelp is ""rapidly becoming a de  facto search engine,"" as users prefer Yelp over other search options for  reviews.Currently, Yelp does not carry any display ads on its mobile app, and  we can expect significant revenues from the mobile app in the future as  it finds ways to monetize it. Yelp does show ads on its mobile web  page, which has been redesigned to be mobile-centric. Yelp's local  advertising business heavily relies on local account listing and mobile  visibility is fast attracting these businesses as it aids in increasing  their reach beyond conventional PC users. A prospective client can  review local listings on the move and decide whether he or she wants to avail  the services or not.International Expansion to Boost RevenueYelp has been quite aggressively pursuing its international  ambitions. In Q4 CY 2012, Yelp acquired Qype, Europe's largest local  reviews site, which gave it access to over 2 million reviews and 15  million unique user across 13 European countries. In 2012, Yelp also  started its operations in Poland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and other  European markets. Yelp also entered the Asian market with a Singapore  launch in 2012. We expect it to continue to move into additional new  markets, which should lead to a significant increase in its local  advertising revenues.However, we expect average revenue per active business account for Yelp  to decline from $2,860 in 2012 to $2,490 by the end of our forecast  period (2019). The primary reason for this decline will be Yelp's  international expansion. As Yelp looks to expand into emerging  economies, the average revenue will decline because local businesses in  these markets tend to spend less on ads compared to their counter parts  in the U.S. However, international expansion will also help Yelp attract  more eyeballs from new markets, drive page views and brand advertising  revenue. We also expect Yelp to announce the number of new business  listed and user that it acquired in this quarter, from expansion abroad.We currently have a $16 Trefis price estimate for Yelp, which stands nearly 35% below its market price.Disclosure: No positions."
1379891,22148,2013-04-28T15:30:56-04:00,,"While performing research for an article on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the constant discussion on original content made me wonder about other content generators. Especially when considering the massive valuations of entertainment content companies. As an example, nonfiction content creator Discovery Communications (NASDAQ:DISCA) has a market value of $28B and The Walt Disney Corporation (NYSE:DIS) is worth $111B. Is it possible for user generated content to ever create companies of that size?All of those firms are vastly different from a focus of distributing content in the case of Netflix to the creating content for a vast network of cable channels at Discovery to creating films and TV shows at Disney. In general, all of the companies are involved in the creation and distribution of entertainment content that has historically had significant value creation.All of this discussion about the value of content and push to more original content by Netflix generated a thought that the creation of user generated reviews might eventually be considered as more valuable content. The value could be immense to advertisers such as major brands and local companies looking to attract new customers.The question is whether Yelp (NYSE:YELP) can eventually provide the review content that is generally considered more valuable than entertainment content of a Disney film or the House of Cards series from Netflix. At the end of 2012, Yelp had collected 36M user submitted reviews. This data can be used to find the best local restaurant or even a good plumber in the metro area. Will that data only be used to supplant the Yellow Pages for generic company information, or will the content eventually be seen as more valuable than all other content? After all, the experts always claim that content is king and Yelp is quickly moving to having a substantial amount of content.General Details On User Generated ReviewsThe Yellow Pages were always seen as a valuable list of businesses. For the uninitiated under 30 crowd, it only provided a basic list of corporations in general categories with ads sold to firms placed on the sides of the pages. This information was great for providing a general list of companies in a sector, but it did nothing to highlight or list the best company. Heck, the concept even spawned the naming of a business with the ""AAA"" in order to show up first in that particular sector under the theory that consumers would call the first name in the list.Than came along websites that started collecting user reviews with TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP), Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI), and Yelp leading the way. TripAdvisor has become a huge success, as the online travel industry was quick to adopt advertising for online travel. The Internet quickly replaced paying fees for travel agencies as researching a hotel online in a far flung destination quickly became more intriguing with websites that compared prices and highlighted hotel features and showcased pictures. More localized services such as contractors via Angie's List and restaurants via Yelp have been slower to advertise. Partially because users still utilized the Yellow Pages for local search or a friend in the case of contractors. Also, the nature of the business has vastly changed to where advertising systems can now target a user based on mobile location and general search criteria.Yelp DetailsAs mentioned, Yelp focuses on the collection of user generated reviews that have accumulated to 36M by the end of 2012 or a 45% increase over the end of 2011. Unique visitors jumped 31% to 86.3M in Q4 2012 and topped 100M users during January. Maybe most importantly, the amount of paying local business accounts jumped 68% year over year to nearly 40K during Q4.Currently, the company sees the target audience as the 667M US, Western Europe, and Canada Internet users, with that target eventually expanding to the whole world of 2.3B internet users. The target advertisers are over 73M worldwide with 53M in the Western world, while Yelp only has roughly 1M that actively claim the business in the service and just 40K of those actually pay to advertise.Revenue grew 65% last year to $138M with a target to expand another 53% to $210M in 2013 and approaching $300M next year. The company just turned EBITDA positive and expects to hit over $20M in EBITDA this year.At a valuation of $1.6B, Yelp only trades at about 8x this year's revenue and a more reasonable 5x next year's numbers. The stock trades at a similar valuation to Angie's List and significantly below the $7.5B market cap of TripAdvisor.Cohort AnalysisWhile all of the data about creating content has been generally positive and can be spun into unlimited potential, the biggest issue remains turning those reviews into revenue. Unfortunately, businesses don't just automatically seek out Yelp for advertising. Generally, the service can even push away local firms if the reviews are negative. Hence, the company has developed cohorts (markets) where a Community Manager is hired and sales reps seek out local businesses to claim their business on Yelp and eventually advertise. Once the Community Manger is hired at a cost of generally below $100,000, the amount of reviews accelerates in the cohort. Over the next few years, the reviews explode and local advertisers come rolling in. The below slide from the February investor presentation highlights the progress in the cohorts that have existed for at least 2 years.The business has exploded in the markets that have been open for over six years. One needs to consider that these are generally the largest markets such as San Francisco, New York, and Boston, so the total reviews and local ad revenue can't be generalized and extrapolated to all markets. Some recent markets include large international locations such as Paris that only started in 2011. In total, the company has launched in 20 international countries, including recently in Poland and Turkey.Comparative ValuationsAn example of the value potential for Yelp is that the forward revenue multiple for TripAdvisor that has a $1B+ run rate actually exceeds that of the faster growing Yelp. In addition, the huge Discovery Communications has a multiple of 5.6x the revenue expectations. Of course, the multiple for Disney is much smaller and Netflix is considerably lower as the company focuses more on low-cost distribution. As the chart shows, the business model could support huge multiples in the future if Yelp can truly become a valued content provider and eventually lower marketing and sales expenses.YELP Forward Price / Sales Ratio data by YChartsConclusionBefore Yelp can become a huge success, it will need to prove that the company can be profitable with the concept. Ultimately though, the user generated content could become immensely more valuable to advertisers. Whether it ever reaches the levels of a Discovery Communications or Netflix is questionable, but only matching the existing value of fellow user generated reviews site TripAdvisor would provide a 400% gain.Investors will be keen to watch the sales and marketing expenses to see whether the company is scaling towards profits that could be massive in the future as local advertisers flock to the service evident by the 87% growth rate in Q412. Assuming Yelp doesn't fall victim to some of the main complaints of faulty and adverse reviews impacting advertisers, the business could boom for years and investors should load up for huge gains.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1119521,31201,2013-01-18T04:17:09-05:00,,"In the wake of Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) recent ""Graph Search"" announcement and the FTC's decision that allows Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) to place Yelp's (NYSE:YELP) free link anywhere it wants in its user searches, Yelp boldly responded by… announcing plans to provide health code rating information associated with its restaurant listings.While Yelp's recent announcement may be useful for individuals who use the website for dining decisions, the move may have left more than a few investors puzzled since it further antagonizes the relationship between Yelp and a significant subsection of its customer base (i.e. local restaurants), adds yet another incentive for local restaurants to pre-empt their customers from visiting Yelp, and further reduces the universe of companies with any incentive to advertise with the popular online review site. Moreover, this decision has the potential to create liability for the company.Consistently Finding New Ways to Antagonize Local Business:As previously discussed here, investors should be wary not to confuse Yelp's customer base (i.e. local businesses) with Yelp's users (i.e. the customers of local businesses). A failure to recognize such a distinction might make Yelp's recent announcement seem positive for the company. While providing health code ratings to Yelp users gives them more information, the decision is clearly not favorable to local restaurants based on the reaction from the New York Restaurant Association, as described here. In summary, oftentimes online information on a health inspection is out of date or has nothing to do with food safety. Moreover, certain ratings have the potential to be incorrectly perceived in a negative light by the general public who may not understand nuances associated with a particular rating, as described here.The practical effect of Yelp's most recent decision is that it has increased the number of local restaurants that should have incentives to pre-empt their potential customers from ever reaching Yelp's website. If a local restaurant has a concern about a finding issued by its local health inspector, that restaurant now has an incentive to spend more advertising dollars to prevent its potential customer base from ever finding that information on Yelp. In light of the FTC's recent decision on Google's search algorithm, those local restaurants should be making every effort to push Yelp's free link to the bottom of any user search.Moreover, the move seems to further reduce the number of restaurants with an incentive to advertise with Yelp. It now appears, that the only restaurants that should have an incentive to advertise are those local restaurants that are highly rated, with favorable health code ratings, in regions where there is stiff competition among other equally highly-rated restaurants that also have favorable health code ratings. Logically, local restaurants that are highly rated, but received negative health code ratings, now have little incentive to advertise with Yelp since it would only serve to highlight that negative health code rating information. With this in mind, investors may want to further question Yelp's ability to retain the advertising revenue from its already small fractional base of four percent of the company's overall listings.Potential Liability:While various types and forms of litigation surrounding Yelp have already been widely publicized (as described here), Yelp's most recent decision has the potential to create more legal liability for the company. While there is probably nothing that prohibits Yelp from displaying health code ratings that are publicly available, it may want to proceed with caution if it decides to move ahead with its plan. Failure to carefully handle the ratings assigned to local restaurants could lead to potential problems. For example, what happens if Yelp's website accidentally lists an incorrect heath code rating for a local restaurant? What happens if Yelp accidentally links negative health code rating information that belongs to one local restaurant and transposes it on a different restaurant's listing? What happens if a local restaurant's health code rating is upgraded but that upgrade fails to properly update on Yelp in a timely manner?Michael Luca's 2011 Harvard School of Business case study on Yelp helped to establish that information available on Yelp's website could potentially have a direct impact on a local restaurant's revenue. If negative health code rating information linked to a local restaurant listed on Yelp is not updated in a timely manner or is inaccurate, that negative information could potentially negatively impact business for that particular restaurant. If Yelp does not proceed with caution, its new feature has the potential to generate even more litigation for the company. For example, a local restaurant might decide to take legal action against Yelp because it believed that it lost, or is losing, revenue due to inaccurate or outdated information being publicly posted by Yelp. Alternatively, some savvy plaintiff's attorney might decide to explore whether there might be money to be made in a potential class action lawsuit targeting inaccuracies in Yelp's public postings of health code ratings.Conclusion:The company has already admitted that its new feature doesn't ""necessarily provide a direct contribution to Yelp's bottom line,"" as described in the article here. In light of that admission, Yelp investors may want to pause to consider why an unprofitable company, facing significant increases in competition from the likes of Facebook and Google, made the decision to invest its time, energy, and resources in an unprofitable project.While making a positive impact on society is certainly a noble goal, these types of efforts are generally best left to governments, municipalities, and non-profit advocacy organizations. It's unlikely that we'll see companies like Facebook and Google follow suit in this endeavor, since as a general matter, private companies tend to avoid these kinds of activities as they don't tend to result in favorable returns on investment.Then again some of Yelp's management might already realize that the company might not be headed in the right direction. This could help to explain why Joseph Nachman (Yelp's Sr. VP of Revenue), Geoffrey Donaker (Yelp's COO), and Wilson Laurence (Yelp's General Counsel and Secretary) sold off a collective total of over 21,000 shares of Yelp stock in the first ten days of January, as shown here.Disclosure: I am short YELP.

1117591,23762,2013-01-17T11:26:11-05:00,,"Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) made a major well-publicized announcement yesterday. The company unveiled a social search tool that will leverage the data on its one billion members. This effort is seen by analysts as a shot across the bow of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), LinkedIn (LNKD) and Yelp (NYSE:YELP). My take is Google has little to worry about at this point as it is hard to see how this effort will impact its huge market share of web search and near monopoly on mobile search. Likewise, LinkedIn's models should be safe as most people want to keep their business and personal lives separate. However, this is a major blow to Yelp, a company I have been negative on and a stock I have been short since it was trading at $27 a share. Consider how Facebook's new search tool could upend Yelp's business model or at least take significant market share.Yelp's Model: Get reviews on restaurants, movies, shops etc… by what strangers are saying.Facebook's Model: Get reviews on restaurants, movies, shops, etc… by how they are perceived by your friends and close associates.It seems hands down that Facebook is on the way to building a much better mousetrap.

The  company announced its Q3 results in November and reported a solid 63%  jump in net revenues year over year, with revenues coming in at $36.4 million.  Cumulative reviews grew 49% year over year to more than 33 million, with average  unique monthly visitors growing by 37% to 84 million.The company derives  a major portion of its revenue from local advertising and brand  advertising and also dabbles in auxiliary services like deals,  reservations and bookings for additional revenue. During the earnings  call, we will look closely at how its international expansion plans are  faring. We'll also look at how mobile usage continues to grow, and may  account for a significant portion of Yelp's revenue, going forward given  its recent momentum following partnerships with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Bing.We highlight some key trends driving its business below.Expanding Worldwide PresenceYelp has been quite aggressively pursuing its international  ambitions. In the last couple of months, it started operations in  Poland, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and other European markets. It also  entered the Asian market with a Singapore launch in 2012. We expect it  to continue to move into additional new markets, which should lead to a  significant increase in its local advertising revenues. We expect active  paying local businesses to reach 100,000 by the end of our forecast  period. The expansion will also help Yelp attract more eyeballs from new  markets, drive page views and brand advertising revenue.Mobile Monetization Key as Yelp Expands InternationallyYelp is focusing on leveraging its growing user base via its mobile  app. It has nearly 8.2 million monthly unique mobile users and has  integrated its services into Siri and the new Apple Maps application on  iOS 6. Yelp is ""rapidly becoming a de facto search engine"" as users  prefer Yelp over other search options, when it comes to reviews.Mobile penetration is high with almost 45% of all  searches occurring on mobile and 50% of photos contributed by users are  also from mobile phones. Currently it does not run any ads on its mobile  app, and we can expect significant revenues from the mobile app in the  future as it finds ways to monetize it. Yelp does show ads on its mobile  web page, which has been redesigned to be mobile-centric. Yelp  currently operates in ~90 cities, with Q3 witnessing launches in new  markets including international markets such as Singapore and Poland.Yelp's Open Model Is an Edge Facebook May Never HaveWith its current features, the Graph Search by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is really no match for online recommendations provider Yelp, but it can potentially disrupt its business in the long  run. Using Graph Search, a Facebook users can make queries about their  friends' locations and interests, to generate a much smaller pool of  recommendations, compared to the hundreds posted on Yelp. Facebook users  can ask for restaurants their friends visited recently and see reviews,  but considering the fact that each user has only a limited number of  friends, this query is likely to generate very few answers.The biggest disadvantage for Facebook's Graph Search is that it is  governed by privacy rules and not all users may be willing to reveal  their activities, which significantly reduces its information potential.  The search query is also restricted to mining data from friends and  open profiles on Facebook, and this is a much smaller pool compared to  Yelp. Yelp's biggest advantage is the fact that these reviews and  recommendations are voluntary and open for any user to read. Even  professional restaurant critics tend to provide feedback on Yelp, and  these recommendations are more likely to be taken seriously than what  Graph Search is likely to provide.We currently have a $15 Trefis price estimate for Yelp, which stands nearly 30% below its market price.Disclosure: No positions."
1112491,31201,2013-01-15T09:53:07-05:00,,"Despite Yelp's (NYSE:YELP) inability to turn a profit since going public in the Spring of 2012, as shown here, some Wall Street analysts and pundits still remain bullish on the stock. Wall Street analysts who see significant upside for Yelp often base their opinion on the questionable logic that the company's future is bright because of the large amount of potential for local advertising revenue that still remains untapped by the company. Investors may want to question this logic since it is unclear whether these analysts and pundits understand fundamental issues that seem to exist within Yelp's business model and how the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) recent decision on Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) search algorithm might negatively impact Yelp.Yelp's Questionable Business Model:Wall Street analysts who see potential for Yelp often point to the fact that only approximately four percent of the company's listings are actually paying customers (as described here). The questionable logic that follows is that 96 percent of the listings then could become paying customers and therefore Yelp's potential for future revenue growth is significant. Unfortunately, these analysts may have failed to consider that Yelp's business model seemingly prevents it from monetizing a significant amount of its listings. This is even after recognizing that some of Yelp's listings are geographic locations, and not businesses (for example, Yelp has reviews for places like ""Lincoln Road"" which is a street in Miami).When analyzing future potential advertising revenue, investors may want to first consider that Yelp has been around for more than just a few years. More specifically, the company has been in existence since October of 2004. Despite having over eight years of experience trying to monetize local advertising revenue (during a period when competition was scarce or non-existent), Yelp has only been able monetize a very small fraction of its listings today. As competition increases from larger companies such as Google, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), and smaller rivals such as FourSquare, investors and analysts may want to ask themselves why they believe Yelp can increase its advertising revenue moving forward, especially in light of its eight year track record of generally being unprofitable and ability to only monetize a small fraction of listings during a period when competition was significantly limited. More discussion of the competitive landscape for Yelp can be found here.Next, Yelp generates income by selling ad space to businesses. Yelp's ""customers"" are not the individuals who read and write reviews, but rather are the businesses that are being reviewed. As an aside, some analysts base their high opinion of Yelp on what they believe to be a strong ""brand."" These analysts seem to be confusing the brand image that Yelp has with its users (i.e. customers of local businesses), with the image that potential customers (i.e. local businesses) have of Yelp. Yelp's brand is, in fact, viewed very negatively by at least some of its potential customers, as evidenced by the ""We Hate Yelp"" and ""Boycott Yelp"" Facebook pages, which can be found here and here. This is of course notwithstanding the fact that Yelp's users have given the company a less than stellar three star rating, as found here.More importantly, after taking into consideration the distinction between Yelp's customers and users, Professor Michael Luca's 2011 Harvard Business School case study on Yelp actually helps to establish that many of Yelp's potential customers (i.e. local businesses) have significant incentives to avoid advertising on Yelp all-together. If in fact local business revenue is directly tied to Yelp ratings (as the Harvard study, which can be found here, indicates), then local companies with less than top ratings should have no reason to want to draw more attention to, and highlight their negative reviews, along with their average, marginal, or poor Yelp ratings. Additionally, assuming that the Harvard Business case study is accurate, local businesses should now have a very strong incentive to reach potential customers before they ever get to Yelp, and should be spending their advertising dollars accordingly (more on this point later).Moreover, the Harvard Business School study showed that Yelp ratings did ""not affect restaurants with chain affiliation"" leaving an entire, and very large, category of listings with little or no incentive to advertise on Yelp. Additionally, there was nothing in the Harvard Business School study that correlated advertising dollars spent on Yelp with increases in local businesses' revenue.A close examination and analysis of the Harvard Business School case study may help to explain Yelp's persistent unprofitability. Also, when viewing Yelp's business model in the context of the Harvard Business School's case study, Yelp's potential for future revenue seems dramatically smaller than some may want you to believe. The universe of Yelp listings that might potentially be monetized should probably exclude all chain businesses (the Harvard Study indicated that chain businesses are generally unaffected by Yelp ratings), and should probably also exclude all local businesses rated less than four stars on Yelp (logically these companies should be focusing their advertising and marketing budgets to reach consumers before they get to Yelp, or directly on customers who are most likely to write online reviews). After taking all of this into account, and after excluding those Yelp listings that are for geographic locations and not businesses (e.g. roads, landmarks, destinations), the universe of potential untapped revenue starts to dramatically shrink. Essentially, the only companies that should have any incentive to advertise on Yelp would be small local businesses that are already very highly rated in markets with stiff competition from other highly rated small local businesses. All of a sudden, the fact that Yelp has only been able to monetize about four percent of its listings today, despite the fact that it had relatively little competition during the past eight years starts to make a lot more sense. Moreover, with competition for local ad dollars increasing from companies like Google and Facebook (which released its ""Nearby"" feature recently, as described here), how much of Yelp's existing fractional advertising business will it likely retain moving forward? While advocates of the company point to Yelp's near 72 percent contract renewal rate from one year to the next (as described here), remember that the 72 percent is a subset of its four percent of total listings. Unfortunately for Yelp, a large fraction of a small fraction still ends up being a small number when viewed in context of overall listings. Furthermore, what will that percentage look like in a year as Facebook expands its ""Nearby"" feature? How much of that four percent can Yelp retain if Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) replaces Yelp with FourSquare, as speculated in the article here? How many local businesses will extend expiring contracts now that Google has been given carte blanche to list Yelp wherever it might want in its user searches (more on this later)?FTC's Decision May Allow Small Businesses to Preempt Customers' Use of YelpThe questionable logic that analysts have used to justify Yelp's lofty valuations also faces another challenge, namely the FTC's determination that Google's search algorithm was not unfair to competition. The FTC's decision is significant because Yelp specifically identified two main concerns about Google. First Yelp didn't like the fact that Google was using information in its search listings from reviews that were pulled from Yelp (a practice known as ""scraping""). More importantly, Yelp did not like its placements in Google search results. Although Yelp won a very minor victory by preventing Google from ""scraping"" its content, the FTC unanimously voted ""not to pursue a case accusing Google of using unfair competition to enhance its search business."" This is important because Google retains the ability to push ""links to competing sites lower."" Websites like Yelp will likely draw ""fewer customers as a result of Google's free links"" and will be forced to ""advertise more to draw traffic,"" as described in the New York Times article found here.The FTC's decision is especially brutal to Yelp because, as Jeremy Stoppelman (the company's CEO) indicated during Yelp's Q3 earnings call, a majority of Yelp's web traffic is ""driven by search engines, particularly Google."" Like many small businesses that complain about how Yelp lists their business information, Yelp is getting a dose of its own medicine as it is now at the mercy of Google's search algorithm for placement in user searches. Moreover, inputting the search term ""Italian Restaurants"" in Google gives individuals a list of names of local Italian restaurants, ratings provided by Google (through Zagat or Google local), and links to take users directly to individual businesses. A direct link to a search for Italian restaurants in Google can be found here, with Yelp's free link in the middle to the bottom of the page. As Google begins to populate more and more local businesses directly on search pages, the FTC's decision could potentially allow Google search users to seamlessly find local businesses, and ratings associated with those local businesses, without ever seeing a free link to a third party website like Yelp.Additionally, the FTC's decision does nothing to help Yelp's stagnating web traffic. Figures from comScore's Metrix Multi Platform show that Yelp barely broke the top 30 US websites (coming in at 29, which was below companies like Craigslist and Pandora) for overall US web traffic (as identified here in Fred Wilson's November 29, 2012 blog). Additionally, the Quantcast chart below shows that web traffic to Yelp is still significantly off its August 2012 highs.As discussed above, many local businesses already had incentives to focus their advertising dollars and marketing efforts on media other than Yelp. After the FTC's recent decision, they may have even more incentives to go elsewhere. Now that the FTC has determined that Google's search algorithm is not unfair to competition, local advertisers may have more incentives to spend their marketing dollars targeting websites where individuals begin their searches (such as Google). These issues are only compounded by Yelp's seeming inability to significantly grow web traffic organically. This should be of special concern for Yelp, since Jeremy Stoppelman indicated that search engines like Google generally drive web traffic for Yelp. The FTC's decision could also spur local businesses that dislike Yelp's practices, to focus even more of their efforts and advertising dollars on preempting potential customers from ever reaching Yelp. The FTC's decision seems to essentially relegate Yelp to competing with its own potential customers (i.e. small local businesses) for advertising space on Google. This has the potential to create a vicious and negative downward cycle for Yelp. In order to generate the web traffic that might justify customers to advertise with Yelp, Yelp may have to spend significant dollars on advertising to promote its own website. Yet again, Yelp may be in a situation where the only way it can increase revenue is by paying more money out, to bring less money in, (just as it did with the Qype acquisition, as described here).Conclusion:The FTC's recent decision on Google's search algorithm seems to place additional and significant pressure on Yelp. As Yelp reviews become more and more like the scrawlings on a bathroom wall (as described here by Anthony Bourdain, and as consumers grow more concerned about being sued for posting online reviews, as described here), Yelp's remaining useful feature would likely have been as an online listing of local companies. After the FTC decision, even more questions are raised about Yelp's future profitability, since individual users may never make it to Yelp's website for that list of local businesses, now that all the information they need can be found directly from Google's search results page. In a nutshell, if Yelp's prior web traffic was driven by search engines like Google, investors may want to consider what Yelp's future might be like now that the FTC has decided Google's search algorithm can place Yelp just about anywhere it wants on that search results page.And of course if internet users can't find a link to Yelp's webpage when looking for a local business, how long will it be before Yelp becomes the MySpace of online review?Jeremy Stoppelman, other Yelp insiders, and some of the company's beneficial owners might already be asking themselves the same question. As noted here, they disposed of, or sold, over 15 million shares of Yelp since the company's 2012 Q3 earnings call held less than three months ago (a list of transactions can be found here). Investors placing their faith in the opinions of those Wall Street analysts and pundits who seem to be bullish on the stock might want to ask themselves why Yelp's insiders and beneficial owners don't seem to be doing the same.Disclosure: I am short YELP.

974691,24714,2012-11-02T16:29:22-04:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) reported its earnings yesterday and shares are down almost 15 percent on Friday as the company's outlook was slightly below analyst estimates. Yelp, in contrast to other tech darlings like Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), has successfully held its value since its initial public offering in March 2012. In this article, I explain why this might not last long, despite Yelp being a good company.Revenue ProblemsAfter today's stock price decline, Yelp is trading at around 10 times its expected 2012 revenue. Compare this to Groupon (1.04x), Zynga (1.62x), and Facebook (9.21x), and you see how Yelp shares could take a downward spiral. Yelp will still have a higher revenue multiple than Groupon and Zynga since its revenue is expected to increase at a faster rate, but its revenue multiple can easily drop below Facebook's, as Facebook is already very profitable and Yelp still has not proven that it can be profitable yet. I can see Yelp's revenue multiple entering the 5 to 8 times range in the next few months.In addition to being worried by Yelp's revenue multiple, I'm also concerned about its expected revenue growth rate. Analysts expect 47.1 percent revenue growth from 2013, which is high considering that Yelp's revenue is up 65 percent year-over-year in 2012 and 74.5 percent in 2011. This big difference in expected revenue growth shows that Yelp is running out of networks to enter along with ways to further monetize its business. With this kind of decline, I can see Yelp revenue flattening out around the $500 million to $600 million range, which compared to competition would price the company in the $700 to $900 million dollar range, which is 35 percent to 40 percent lower than its current price.Proving It Can EarnThe biggest problem with many tech darlings, with major emphasis on Groupon, Zynga, Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI), and Pandora (NYSE:P), is that they've struggled to be profitable when analysts first expected quarters in the black. Yelp, which had its initial public offering after all four of these companies, is expected to have its first profitable year in 2013 with an earnings per share of 6 cents. However, all of the aforementioned stocks were supposed to be somewhat profitable by now, just like Yelp is, yet all four are still struggling in the red. All four are flirting with profitability now, but none of them have proved that they can be a company that produces long term profitability.It's highly likely that Yelp will continue this trend. Despite being expected to be profitable in 2013, I could picture the company's earnings per share staying in the -20 to -10 cent range. This could cause a major selloff among impatient investors and cause shares to drop off.CompetitionYelp has become the market leader in user review websites. Cumulative reviews grew 49 percent in the last year to over 33 million (from the earnings report) and I believe this kind of review growth will be typical for Yelp going forward. However, there is a lot of upcoming competition that threatens to take market share from Yelp. Google has been drastically overhauling Google Maps to further promote user reviews. Its acquisition of Zagat showed its commitment to compete with Yelp. Google Maps is a much more accurate maps application than Yelp, its search function is proving better results than it has in the past, and it has a stronger position in the market, especially in the mobile market, with its search engine and Android operating system.There are several other potential threats looking for a piece of Yelp's business. Other tech darlings like Groupon and Foursquare are looking for new revenue sources and have been trying to improve their local search and review services to gain access to new markets. Yahoo (YHOO) has not been very big on this space, but with Marissa Mayer at the helm, we can expect a stronger effort from Yahoo to revolutionize its local search and review services.ConclusionDespite Yelp being a very good company that so far has performed well relative to its counterparts, I expect a 20 to 30 percent haircut on the stock over the next year and give it a Sell recommendation. There is simply too much uncertainty around the company and its growth potential and I suggest staying away from shares for now. I believe short term at-the-money puts are the best way to short the company, although I personally don't like shorting good companies even if their shares are overvalued. If a major selloff occurs within the next few months, I will reevaluate the company and it is very likely my opinion of Yelp shares will change as I believe the company will still be a leader in the growing local search industry.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

1023561,24480,2012-11-21T13:32:27-05:00,,"Yelp continues to struggle. Since we first took a negative view on Yelp (NYSE: YELP) in our June 25, 2012 article titled ""Why Yelp Is Not A Good Investment: 3 Reasons to Sell the Stock Now"", the stock has tumbled 21.59%.(Above is a chart of Yelp's performance since June 25th, 2012)The three reasons we cited were: 1) Yelp's flawed business model, with high cost of sales and no clear path to profitability; 2) End of their lockup. Lockups also plagued other social media plays, Zynga (NASDAQ: ZNGA) and Groupon (NYSE: GRPN); and 3) Yelp did not fit two key criteria in stocks on Wall Street's Rules of Investing: (NYSE:A) Buy best-of-breed companies and (NYSE:B) Buy damaged stocks, not damaged companies. We consider Yelp a damaged company and it is certainly not a best-of-breed stock.Yelp was heralded as a social media darling earlier this year as shares rocketed up over 60% since their March 2012 IPO. Market pundits initially touted YELP as a better investment than social media plays, Groupon or Zynga. However, after a roller coaster summer, Yelp peaked at $28.89 on October 4, 2012, then plummeted 40%. (Above is a chart of Yelp's performance since October 4th, 2012)Why is Yelp struggling? First, there is widespread concern about Yelp's ad revenue, or lack thereof. Third-quarter earnings beat analyst estimates and revealed that sales rose 63% to $36.4 million. However, fourth-quarter guidance did not meet expectations. Yelp forecast next quarter's revenue at $40-$40.5 million amid lagging ad sales - just short of Bloomberg's average analyst estimates of $40.8 million. Shares fell almost 11%, reversing the stock's upward trend. Yelp's Chief Financial Officer, Robert Krolik, reported fourth-quarter revenue from display ads would be ""flat-to-down"" because of ""execution challenges in that part of the business.""Mobile advertising is another looming challenge. Yelp has also been a laggard at generating mobile advertising revenue, particularly as users increasingly turn to mobile devices for access to social media. Yelp's mobile app generated no revenue in the last quarter.Yelp's integration into Apple Maps has become further cause for concern. Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) vulnerability with its problematic map application is undeniable. All too often, directions are wrong or location data is missing. Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, has apologized for the Apple Map's inadequacies.It's increasingly apparent that Yelp's flaws contribute to Apple Maps' flaws. Yelp's user-sourced business information is leading Apple Map users astray. Apple needs to work more proactively with Yelp for more accurate business listings and review if they hope to fix Maps.Anyone with a Yelp account can add or influence venue data. This may range from the business's location to its operational hours - all without independent verification by the business in question. By comparison, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) requires business owners to confirm their location. Google Maps employs a method known as crowdsourcing.According GigaOM, Yelp's user-based approach results in ""multiple venues entered, prospective businesses that add data but never open, and businesses that are closed but never get removed from Yelp."" GigaOM cites a very telling example involving a Napa Auto Parts location. A search of Apple's Maps found one Napa Auto Parts store in a small California city that had 13 reviews from Yelp users. However, Apple Maps showed that particular location as a pizzeria and there was no mention of Napa Auto Parts.Yelp's approach with hidden reviews and out-of-date businesses will continue to degrade search results and more customer use or map quality improvements wont fix that problem.Here's why Yelp's method of curating posts presents a further problem to Apple Maps. Yelp favors 'elite' user reviews over reviews by regular users. Elites are specifically selected for their seemingly authentic reviews and profile information. This means the primary reviews seen by searchers are hand picked by Yelp. When using a full browser, the filters can be circumnavigated and other reviews by regular users can also be accessed. But Yelp's mobile application and Apple Maps do not allow those filtered reviews to be seen. As a result, much information is missing. This is likely to become a bigger problem for Yelp, especially if Apple decides to terminate their contract and look for better, more accurate alternatives.We continue to believe there are just too many negatives outweighing the positives for Yelp. If you're a current shareholder, sell on a bounce. With or without Apple Maps, we remain bearish on Yelp.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

You will be presented with a list of restaurants in the surrounding area with quality rankings based on Yelp (NYSE:YELP) reviews. The IOS integration was announced on September 19, 2012 on the Yelp blog and applies to all countries where Yelp is active.On the day of the IOS announcement, Yelp stock closed at $25.71. Three months later, the installed based of IOS 6 devices was almost 300 million. Despite this massive influx of new users, Yelp's stock price closed on March 8, 2013 at $25.01.Smartphone searches have become a portal into the local economy. Consumers are using their phones to find all types of vendors. Yelp is not just for restaurants. It has  reviews for gyms, plumbing supplies, carpet and all types of services. In the 2012 10-K filing, Yelp shows the types of reviewed businesses with the chart below.According to the Yelp 10-K, the number of reviewed business locations grew 64% as of December 2012 from the prior year. Revenue for the year ending December 2012 was $137.6 million, rising 65% from 2011. Yelp is not yet profitable and has not attracted positive ratings from many analysts. According to Yahoo Finance, Yelp has a Price/Sales ratio of 10.87. By comparison, Facebook has a Price/Sales ratio of 13.38.The scope of the Yelp business search is wide. The company's main competitor is Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) with Bing (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Yahoo (YHOO) being secondary challengers. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) is showing interest in business search also. I am skeptical about the potential for Facebook Graph Search to become a competitor for Yelp.Yelp is a high-risk speculative investment. As the smartphone transition continues, it could become a key player in local business search. At market close on March 8 2013, Google had a market capitalization of $274 billion compared with $1.59 billion for Yelp. If Yelp can leverage its IOS integration to become a major competitor in local search, then I would expect its value to increase significantly.Disclosure: I am long YELP.

977841,31201,2012-11-05T08:03:11-05:00,,"On November 1, 2012, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) held a conference call to announce its third quarter results. Although most of the information provided during the call had been previously announced, the new information that was released was not received well by investors (as evidenced by the near 15 percent plummet in the company's stock price the next day).The dramatic selloff left some investors puzzled, while others were left wondering whether Yelp might now be oversold (as described here). On Monday, investors may begin asking themselves whether Yelp's newly discounted stock price represents a good entry point. Cautious investors may be wary not to confuse value with weakness.This article examines the new information presented during YELP's third quarter earnings conference call, along with independent third party data, which seem to show that:Yelp - On Track to Become the Next MySpace:During Yelp's most recent earnings call, the company issued weak fourth quarter revenue guidance that was lower than analysts' expectations (as described here). Savvy investors tracking Yelp's web traffic over the past few months, using independent third party websites like Quantcast, were probably aware that Yelp's fourth quarter guidance would be poor. They probably already knew that Yelp's web traffic began to rapidly decline at the start of September, as shown in the chart below. Unfortunately for Yelp and its investors, the downward pace of that trend line appears to be accelerating (a link to the chart can be found here).Investors need to be concerned with the Quantcast trend line because the revenue growth experienced by Yelp in the second and third quarter of 2012, tracks the trend line in the chart above. Logically, the recent downward trend in Yelp's web traffic should then indicate future revenue decline. Such a theory would help to explain and corroborate Yelp's management's forecast for a weak fourth quarter. Of course if Yelp's web traffic keeps dropping at its current pace, investors may begin to question whether Yelp should have issued even softer guidance for next quarter and if the company will end up going six consecutive quarters without making a profit. And if Yelp is unable to reverse this trend, how long before investors start wondering when it will join the likes of other internet ""flash in the pans"" like MySpace?I'll Gladly Pay You Tuesday, For a Hamburger TodayAlthough a prior article (which can be found here) questioned the wisdom of Yelp's decision to acquire Qype, the extent of that poor decision-making only became fully apparent during the earnings call when a member of the Yelp management team indicated that:The words above are a direct quote from Robert Krolik (Yelp's CFO and Principal Accounting Officer), the text of which can be found here. It essentially means that Yelp paid $50 million so it could spend $2 to make $0.90. Either Yelp's management team actually believes this makes good business sense, or the acquisition was not carefully thought through before consummation. Lending credence to the latter possibility, Geoff Donaker (Yelp's COO and Director) stated during the conference call with regards to Qype's integration into Yelp, that ""we'll sort of figure out what the integration looks like in the months ahead."" (emphasis added).The fact that Yelp's management team made the decision to pull the trigger on the deal before knowing how Qype would be eventually be integrated into the larger business makes one wonder what other major business decisions (e.g. like becoming profitable for its investors) still need to be ""sort of"" figured out?If It's Broken, You Should Fix ItDespite all of Yelp's other issues, some skeptics believe that the company's fatal flaw lies in its core business model which appears to be broken. One aspect of Yelp's broken business model can be found in the weak controls the company places on user generated content, as described here. The controls seem to be purposely weak to allow Yelp's users to generate as many reviews on the site as possible. Unfortunately, these unverified reviews also put local businesses immediately on the defensive because of the harm they do to their reputations. For example, Yelp allows its users to outright lie (as described here), it allows its users to remain anonymous, and provides no guidance on the rating system it uses (all of which are described here).The end result of the problems existent in Yelp's business model is a situation where many of the company's potential customers (i.e. small local businesses) hate Yelp. To truly understand the visceral negative reaction that Yelp garners from its potential customers, one only has to visit the ""We Hate Yelp"" Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page (that can be found here). It has hundreds of members and appears to be growing at a breakneck pace. Unlike almost every other business that tries to maintain good relationships with their customers, Yelp seems to be actively trying to alienate theirs.Interestingly enough, rather than gear future investment to fixing these flaws by hiring new talent and developing new technology, Yelp seems to think that it will be able to force its broken business model on local businesses by spending more on advertising and hiring more sales staff. In response to questions about Yelp's direction for the future, Robert Krolick made it clear that the company would continue ""investment in sales and marketing."" Investors might want to consider how successful this future investment strategy is likely to be, especially in light of how unsuccessful it has been so far (as described here).ConclusionDuring the company's earnings call, Yelp's management team completely failed to address how it will successfully tap into mobile, despite the fact that Yelp's 8 million mobile users are currently dwarfed by FourSquare's estimated 20 million users (which is growing at a pace of 1 million users a month as described here). The company confirmed that its international expansion into 43 markets during a time of global economic crisis is not ""very much contributing at all to [Yelp's] revenue."" (emphasis added). On November 1st, it also became abundantly clear that Yelp is completely reliant on its closest competitors to survive and unable to exist as an independent platform. As Jeremy Stopplemen (Yelp's CEO) so eloquently put it, a majority of the traffic that is driven to Yelp comes from ""search engines, particularly Google.""And while Yelp's management made it clear that they highly value Yelp's integration into Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS 6, investors may be wondering if that feeling is mutual in light of the fact that Yelp's dirty crowd sourced data has been key in the epic failure of Apple maps and iOS 6, as described here and here. While Apple is going to have to rely on Yelp's dirty crowd-sourced data in the short term, one has to wonder how much longer a company so obsessed with perfection will continue to rely on Yelp's very imperfect model.Most importantly, if web traffic and revenue start to rapidly decline (which appears to be happening), how much more growth can Yelp achieve if investors stop giving the company $2 to pay for every $0.90 cents it brings in?Disclosure: I am short YELP. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

972581,22762,2012-11-02T09:19:23-04:00,,"By Kim-Mai CutlerYelp narrowed its net loss to $2 million for the third quarter after pulling in $36.4 million in net revenue.  That’s up 63 percent from the same quarter a year earlier. The company  said total reviews went up by 49 percent to 33 million, while the number  of local business accounts grew by 82 percent to 35,500. The company  changed its guidance for the year, projecting net revenue of $40 million  to $40.5 million, with adjusted EBITDA (or earnings before interest,  taxes, debt and amortization) of $1.25 million to $1.5 million.Even though Yelp’s fourth quarter revenue forecast came in slightly  below analysts’ average estimate of $40.8 million, Yelp’s shares rose  slightly in after-hours trading to $24.45 a share. Compared with many of  the other consumer web companies that went public in the last year like  Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Yelp has held steady at a market  capitalization of around $1.5 billion since its IPO earlier this year.The company is focused on breaking into international markets, with its recent $50 million deal to by European competitor Qype and  launches in Helsinki and Singapore. Singapore is the company’s first  foray into Asia. About half of Yelp’s 96 global markets are outside of  the U.S.Like all of the major consumer Internet companies including Google  (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Facebook, Yelp is seeing its users shift onto mobile devices. Yelp’s  mobile app is also growing at a healthy pace with about 8 million  unique devices a month.While this shift may hurt short-term profitability, it could be a  very attractive long-term opportunity. Nearly half of all Yelp’s  searches are done from a mobile device.

953591,31201,2012-10-26T02:34:54-04:00,,"On the morning of October 24, 2012, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) issued a pre-earnings announcement indicating that it was acquiring rival European competitor, Qype. The company also announced that revenue for the third quarter would likely be higher than many analysts predicted, but that it would still be unprofitable. Shares of Yelp swelled through mid-day trading on October 24, 2012 to close seven percent higher than the day before.While Yelp's announcement of better than expected revenue was well timed to take advantage of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Yahoo's favorable earnings calls, the information provided by all three companies earlier this week should leave Yelp investors very concerned. Based on the information released by the three companies, it is now clear that:1. Yelp is not likely to be acquired,2. Its ability to survive as a standalone business is highly questionable,3. The company's organic growth has stalled and its future growth strategy is dubious at best.Girl Next Door Pretty; Princess Attitude:During Yahoo's (YHOO) earnings call, the company's CEO Marissa Mayer quickly quashed any speculation regarding whether Yelp might be an acquisition target at its current valuations. As described here, the guidance she outlined for future acquisitions shows that her focus moving forward will be to acquire small companies for technology and talent, not content. During Facebook's last earnings call, Mark Zuckerberg, outlined a similar strategy to acquire talent (as described here).The announcements issued by Yahoo and Facebook are important because it shows a shift in what top tech and internet companies are placing value in. It appears that the industry as a whole learned from Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) map fiasco, and has decided to place a much higher priority on good technology and talent that will draw crowds to their websites, rather than on crowd sourced content (which helped cause Apple's map problems as described here).Sure, there was once a time when Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Yahoo were each interested in Yelp as a potential acquisition, but Yelp previously rejected both of them as suitors. Today's landscape is much different now that Google has Zagat, Yahoo seems to be pursuing Open Table, and Facebook appears to have decided to muscle its way into the picture (as described here).So it stands to reason, with very little hope for being acquired at current valuations, can Yelp survive an increasingly competitive landscape as a standalone company?Four Straight Quarters of Unprofitability:In addition to announcing the acquisition of Qype, Yelp's pre-earnings announcement also made it clear that it would, yet again, be unprofitable. After the tech bubble burst, one would've thought that financial disasters like Pets.com would've taught investors to more closely question a business model that has failed to make a profit since its inception.To be fair though, all good companies have bad quarters. More importantly, start-up tech companies often need to spend significant cash to generate substantial growth, which comes at a cost. Unprofitability in and of itself is not always a red flag. For example, Facebook announced an unprofitable quarter, but the significant increase in revenue offset any concerns raised there. Yelp investors who bought on October 24, 2012 stand to reason that the ""revenue-beat"" generated by the company should also be viewed in a favorable light as well. Of course when the onion is peeled back, there are significant differences between the two companies and their situations. Unlike Facebook, Yelp has never seen a profitable quarter. Unlike Facebook, most investors expected Yelp to be profitable in a quarter that was hyped to be a blockbuster due to Yelp's integration into Apple's iOS 6. The potential for profitability was probably the reason that initial investors held onto their shares after the lockup expiration, and the reason why Yelp stock soared in September and early October.Sadly, Yelp's pre-earnings announcement of slightly better than expected revenue and a smaller than expected loss leaves much to be desired. If Yelp was unable to be profitable in an overhyped quarter, right before it was integrated into Apple's maps, what hope does the company have of ever being profitable now that Apple's maps have been derided as a complete bust? In the one quarter when Yelp was best positioned to prove that it could function as a standalone company (rather than as a bit player with aspirations of being acquired by another), it simply failed to deliver.How will Yelp compete as a standalone company in a business space becoming increasingly crowded by the likes of tech titans such as Google/Zagat, Yahoo/Open Table, and Facebook? What does Yelp have in its hip pocket to protect its position from other mid-size players like Urban Spoon, Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI), and TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP)? What moats will Yelp rely on to prevent companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)/Living Social, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), or any other Tom, Dick and Harry with a website, from entering the competitive landscape? It's clear that cash or profits are not on the list of answers to those questions.Based on the latest press releases issued by Yelp, the company's path forward is clear. It is banking on survival by growth outside the US through expansion and acquisition.Yelp's acquisition of Qype = MySpace acquiring Friendster:While planning international Yelp Elite parties in Poland and Singapore are probably time consuming and intensive, someone at the company should probably alert Yelp's management team to the fact that there is a current global economic crisis facing the world. Alan Mulally, the CEO of Ford, seems to understand this as his company mulls the decision of whether to close plants in Europe. Marissa Mayer also seems to understand this as she extricates Yahoo from various overseas positions (as described here and here) and when she indicated that: ""We'll stay in markets where we can find growth and exit where we can't."" In fact many top companies recognize how difficult markets are in Europe and Asia, which is why they are trying to re-focus on their energies elsewhere. It is entirely unclear exactly why Yelp believes that overseas expansion and acquisitions are a good strategic business move in today's global economic environment.Even more confounding though is Yelp's decision to acquire Qype. While Qype offers Yelp more content by bringing accounts and reviews of more overseas businesses, there is little value to the acquisition beyond that content. The move is strategically no different than if in the early 2000's MySpace announced that it would be acquiring Friendster in an attempt to acquire more accounts and content to compete with Facebook. More importantly, the move is in the opposite direction currently being taken by other internet companies like Yahoo and Facebook. As discussed above, both Facebook and Yahoo understand that in today's market, companies need to be acquiring technology and talent rather than content (since content will come when a company has the right technology and talent). It appears that since Yelp is unable to compete with the other companies for the technology and talent necessary to be successful, it has been relegated to settle for content acquisitions in an attempt to convince investors that it has a viable future as a standalone company.Conclusion:The stock price spike generated by Yelp's pre-earnings announcement on October 24, 2012 completely evaporated after many investors had time to digest the information generated by the earnings reports of Yahoo, Facebook, along with the pre-earnings announcement from Yelp.Some investors may decide to hold onto their position in Yelp until November 1, 2012 to hear what the company's management has to say on its quarterly earnings call. They may be clinging to the hope that the future of Yelp, after four straight quarters of unprofitability, will hinge on information to be provided during that call. Those investors should be wary though, because not only must those answers be good, they must be believable. Of course some Yelp shareholders, like Jeremy Stoppleman (Yelp's CEO), and Geoffrey Donaker (Yelp's COO), seem to have realized that bubbles swell before they burst and have timed (as seen here and here) their exit points appropriately.And of course for all of the rest of those looking to make money off of Yelp, it appears that the company is willing to pay millions to acquire other online review sites. Those with the right kind of gumption to start their own business might find this as an attractive alternative. Remember though, for those who choose to go this route, when closing the deal with Yelp, make sure the sale is consummated with all cash and no stock.Disclosure: I am short YELP.

946411,37461,2012-10-24T14:23:46-04:00,,"Shorting Yelp (NYSE:YELP) boils down to shorting an over-valued ""social media"" type company that makes no money and is experiencing slowing growth metrics across the board. The internet review space is a crowded field, and investors are expecting best case scenarios for a company like Yelp in terms of future ad monetization rates. I do think Yelp provides a valuable service (I use it all the time), however the market is rewarding Yelp shareholders before the company has even proven it's worthy enough to warrant an 11x forward revenue multiple. My guess is that this stock has a big leg down coming at some point over the next couple of quarters when the Street sees that the company's revenue metrics continue to degrade.You most likely know Yelp as one of the most well-known review sites on the internet currently. Yelp generates over 90% of its revenue from pure advertising. About 70% of revenue is comprised of local ads - to be clear, local businesses (like restaurants or various shopping stores) do not have to pay to be reviewed on Yelp. They simply pay to have their restaurant name appear on the side of the website, or to be more prominently displayed on the website. Then about 20% of revenue is comprised of brand advertising, which are for bigger company accounts with more of a national presence. The remaining <10% of revenue comes from a variety of other services like Yelp deals and such.As you probably expected, restaurants are the most common businesses that are reviewed on Yelp. Penetration of the local market is the key to Yelp's success. The company claims to have 30.3 million reviews on the Yelp site with about 78 million unique visitors each month. Yelp is in 90 markets around the world, 51 in the U.S. and 39 in international markets. The company does have a Yelp app, but it does not generate any ad dollars from the app. Just like most social media companies, figuring out how to monetize the smartphone is key to the company's success.Main points to the short:1. Small markets to penetrate: Yelp has been opening up in major cities in the U.S. since 2004 (when it was founded), and started going after international markets in 2009. It experienced exponential growth as these major markets were tapped, and the company was able to rake in remarkable top line growth, as these were all big cities with tons of restaurants and tons of local ad dollars being spent on Yelp. Yelp then tapped major European cities and also English-speaking international cities, which were easier to tap and quicker to build a presence. Yelp continued to grow its cumulative market penetration, but what it saw in 2010 and 2011 was a serious slowing in monetization rate growth. As Yelp has tapped all of the big, English-speaking markets early on in its life, it was able to monetize those markets pretty effectively. Yelp saw a sequential decline in revenue per market for the first time in the 1st quarter of this year, as the markets it is now entering are not as lucrative as previous new markets. Revenue metrics have plateaued somewhat in the $1.5 million per market range. I do not see how this metric can move up significantly.2. Smartphone monetization: Yelp currently generates zero revenue through its Yelp app. It generates a very small amount of revenue via ads on mobile devices for users who simply use the regular Yelp.com website on their smartphones. So the question is: will Yelp figure out how to make money off of the smartphone, and how fast will this monetization occur? This is the question that's plaguing basically every social media company right now. You're starting to see some testing ad methods from the likes of Twitter (ads amongst your twitter feeds) and other companies, but nothing really substantial yet. However, when talking with Yelp's 3rd party investor relations department, it did not seem like mobile monetization had real urgency.3. Reviews are competitive: Restaurant and travel reviews are definitely helpful when choosing locations, I admit. And that is why big players are continuing to grow presence in the online review space. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) acquired Zagat at the end of 2011 in an effort to help build up Google Places and Google+ Local. Google also acquired ITA software in 2010 as it was building a presence in the travel space (and travel review) space (I point this out as an example to demonstrate that Google is actively going after this review space). This competitive threat would not be out of the ordinary except for 2 things: (1) This is Google we're talking about and money is not an issue if it wants to enter an industry, and more importantly (2) about half of Yelp's online traffic comes through Google.com.- Aggressive valuation: Yelp is trading at 11x forward revenue, and it generates negative EBITDA. So the market is implying that Yelp's market is 11x bigger than today, and that the company will be able to penetrate these markets without fail. Another way to quantify what the market is assuming for Yelp is to make aggressive forecasts of the business model and checking out what that spits out from a DCF perspective. In order for the company to be valued in the mid $20/share price range, you'll have to assume that Yelp grows its revenue per market metric 10% for the next 5 years, which is extremely tough to do given the past couple quarters of monetization growth. Also I'm assuming they open over 23 new markets a year (on avg), most of which is front-loaded assuming 36 this year (annualizing the current 6 months of this year), even though Yelp peaked in 2010 + 2011 at 22 new markets per year. Can they really keep this up?More detailed analysis with valuation and financials can be found here.Disclosure: I am short YELP. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

946531,21820,2012-10-24T14:44:23-04:00,,"Earlier today, review company Yelp (NYSE:YELP) announced it would be acquiring its European rival Qype. The acquisition gives Yelp control of Europe's largest local reviews site. Qype is headquartered in Germany, and it appears the review site's strong presence in Germany and the United Kingdom are what Yelp was after. Yelp will be spending 18.6 million Euros and 970,000 shares on the acquisition, putting a price tag at somewhere around $50 million.The deal immediately gives Yelp a huge review base in Europe. Qype had operations in 13 countries prior to the acquisition. Here is a list of countries Yelp was in prior to the deal:· Australia· Austria· Belgium· Canada· Denmark· Finland· France· Germany· Ireland· Italy· Norway· Poland· Singapore· Spain· Sweden· Switzerland· The Netherlands· United KingdomIn 2012 since becoming a public company, Yelp has entered new markets including: Singapore, Poland, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden. The deal with Qype now allows Yelp an entry into countries it wasn't in, and a greater focus on previous markets. Yelp's strategy is to enter one huge market in each new country with Stockholm, Sweden and Copenhagen, Denmark as examples. Qype has a huge database of users and reviews that are the reason Yelp made the deal. Yelp also cuts out their biggest rival company and can now directly take on search and review giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Yahoo (YHOO).Qype also has a deals site called Qypedeals. The site is a Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) style deals site that has offers locked in once a certain number of users claim the deal. The integration of this technology with Yelp's strong American base could hurt Groupon going forward. Shareholders should be excited about the company expanding into a deals site.Along with the news of the acquisition, Yelp announced third quarter revenue was $36.4 million. Analysts on Yahoo Finance were predicting the company would report $35.8 million in revenue. The company's net loss for the quarter was $2.0 million.Yelp saw 78.3 million unique visitors in the second quarter. The company reached a cumulative 30.3 million reviews at the end of the second quarter. Yelp continues to expand its mobile presence with apps that integrate the ability to call businesses directly and receive coupons on their phone.On November 1st, Yelp will report full details of third quarter earnings. During that announcement, the company will also update fourth quarter guidance. Analysts on Yahoo Finance see the company posting a loss of $0.31 per share in 2012 on $136.24 million in revenue. The following year, analysts hope the company will post a profit of $0.05 from $201.09 million in revenue. The 2013 numbers will likely see increases, depending on when the acquisition closes. The time to get behind Yelp is now, with shares ready to breakout. The company has huge growth ahead as its American and international presence grows. New entries into daily deals could also propel revenue numbers for the company.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

945811,22762,2012-10-24T12:06:19-04:00,,"By Ingrid LundenThis just in: online recommendations and listings site Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is stepping up its international push and buying its biggest rival in Europe, Qype. It will pay €18.6 million for all of Qype's shares and is adding another 970,000 shares of Yelp's Class A common stock, for a total purchase price of approximately $50 million. Qype is headquartered in Germany, with operations across Europe. Combined, the two will have a service covering some 93 million monthly unique visitors and 32 million reviews, Yelp's CEO Jeremy Stoppelman noted in a blog post. That should help Yelp compete better against the likes of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which combines its search, listings, user feedback and maps into a powerful product to rival that of Yelp's.At the same time, Yelp offered some updated guidance on its third quarter performance. It looks like it will still be doing better than it had originally said it would be, with revenue exceeding its forecasts made in August. It says that revenues will be $36.4 million, and while it will be still making a net loss - Yelp says it expects it to be $2 million - it's coming down by quite a bit from the $3.8 million net loss for the same quarter a year ago. The company will be publishing its Q3 results on November 1.""I am excited to welcome Qype's employees and users to Yelp. We have built a solid foundation in Europe and this acquisition should significantly increase our international presence. With its strong local content in key markets like Germany and the United Kingdom, we believe that Qype will help Yelp become the de facto choice for local search in those markets,"" said Jeremy Stoppelman, Yelp co-founder and chief executive officer, in a statement. ""Qype's established European sales force will also bring more local business owners into the Yelp ecosystem, which in turn will bolster our mission to connect people with great local businesses all over the world.""""Established European sales force"" might be a bit of an understatement: Qype has long been a competitive thorn in Yelp's side. In May of this year, Qype officially became bigger than Yelp in terms of listings size in Europe, claiming 860,000 places reviewed in its database. That number is now even bigger: two million reviews and 15 million unique visitors per month across 13 countries.Qype also has been looking at ways of diversifying its model, by introducing (yes) daily deals in the form of QypeDeals. And advertising on the site, Qype CEO Ian Brotherson told me in May, had grown 500% since last year.Mobile is also increasingly playing a role. In May, Brotherson said mobile contributed one-quarter of revenues, with its apps installed on six times as many devices as Yelp has in Europe (in May, Qype's install number was four million). Some 30 percent of reviews are written from mobile devices.Yelp, while definitely investing in its European growth, has not been able to keep up the pace, in some cases coming much too late to markets where Qype had already carved out a presence. And at the same time Qype hasn't taken its service too far beyond its region, so its growth prospects as a standalone company would have been limited.And, in the end, that may be the main reason that Yelp had to take Qype out. With companies like Groupon and Yelp, relying as they do on mass take up of their services in order to work as they were built to work, if they don't get their foot in the door very early on, inorganic growth (that is, through acquisitions) is often their only option.Before this acquisition, Qype had raised some $22.5 million from investors including Advent Venture Partners, Wellington Partners and Partech International.Original post"

903451,36481,2012-10-03T17:49:36-04:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is quite the interesting stock for a number of reasons:Yelp's strategy seems to depend heavily on expansion, which is costly and might turn out to be much less profitable than IPO ""investors"" hoped for. I don't want to overemphasize the similarities between Groupon and Yelp, but Groupon is to a small extent similar to Yelp in that both pay people to call local businesses and try to talk them into spending money on their online services in order to attract customers. And both business models are geared toward strong expansion.However, when compared to Yelp, Groupon seems to be cheap. Groupon's P/S ratio is 1.5 -- one-tenth of Yelp's. But still I wouldn't buy Groupon. Of course, that is just one metric. For those of you more interested in what Yelp is worth, there is a excellent Seeking Alpha article on Yelp's valuation that you can find here.So, how does Yelp make money?People Google terms like ""restaurant San Francisco"" and one of the first suggestions will be Yelp. When they click on it, Yelp shows them a few beautiful pictures from top restaurants. These restaurants often pay Yelp to be among the first search results. That is, in a nutshell, how Yelp generates revenue.This may, however, be short-lived revenue. According to one article I read, in some cases customers effectively pay $600 per 1,000 impressions and stop paying Yelp after finding that out.But Yelp is only popular in big U.S. cities. If you don't believe me, Google ""restaurant Frankfurt"" (Germany) instead of ""restaurant San Francisco"" and you'll see that Yelp isn't even on one of the first 10 pages of search results (I didn't bother to look past pg. 10). Services similar to Yelp have long ago filled Yelp's spot in different countries. In Germany, one such service is Prinz, which is the first non-Google search result in my example.That brings me to Yelp's biggest problem: Google. Google itself offers practically everything Yelp does. Most of the time when I'm trying to find a decent restaurant I already am out in the street, in which case I simply use Google Maps on my smartphone. Also, Google last week launched a service that does certain things Yelp does. It probably will be integrated seamlessly into Android and will likely be embraced by users around the world who know the Google brand, but don't know the Yelp brand. Google's new service called Field Trip looks great, but still needs time (and as of now is only available on Android and in the U.S.). What does Field Trip offer that threatens Yelp? Field Trip informs smartphone users about points of interest, including restaurants and deals. It shows Zagat scores for restaurants, but doesn't show Yelp reviews. And it will come to iOS, thereby lowering the relevance of Yelp because it offers an alternative to Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) mapping service for some applications and lowers the probability of using Siri (Siri uses Yelp for restaurant reviews) to search for local restaurants.While Android users can already live without the Yelp app, IPhone users with iOS 6 and without Google Maps on their device can still make good use of it. Reading a few of the reviews Yelp's smartphone app got in the app store, I found out that some users are suspicious about the credibility of Yelp restaurant critics who, in some cases, review as many as 300 restaurants. Users often express disappointment over the limited capabilities of the mobile app. Apparently you have to log on at your computer to post a restaurant review. I think it is safe to assume Yelp will soon enhance the capabilities of its mobile apps because there is room for improvement.Another point I already mentioned is Yelp's problem in terms of becoming relevant internationally. To see some of the discrepancies in how users' opinions on Yelp vary from country to country, I went to iTunes stores from different countries. Here are the ratings the latest version of the app has garnered in selected countries:I looked up more countries and 4.5 stars was the best I could find, but it is only based on 11 reviews and ""all versions"" also had 3.5 stars in France with 314 reviews. Also, what the number of reviews show is that Yelp does not have a broad user base outside the U.S. The German version, for example, has merely 576 reviews for all versions, while the U.S. version has 153,066 reviews. Yes, Yelp is available around the globe, but as of now it is mostly used in the U.S.All that said, you would probably think Yelp makes a good short, but I would not short the stock. In fact, I already shorted it once before and made a small profit, but I was lucky and won't try it again anytime soon. There seems to be strong momentum for the stock, because even after some decent insider selling on Sept. 12 at $24.74, it kept on going higher to over $28 and now is already about $1 above analysts' average target price. I would guess CEO Jeremy Stoppelman (the insider) has an idea of what a good selling point is. Even though I think the future holds more risks than opportunities for Yelp, I decided to leave the stock alone. Yelp's volatility is certainly strong. I have the feeling that many bears are waiting for a level close to the stock's all-time high of $31.96 before shorting it again. I would like to hear about some option strategies for Yelp, so please leave a comment if you have any suggestions.Without a doubt, Yelp is a more useful service than Groupon and many users seem to really enjoy what Yelp offers. For irrational reasons, those same people might buy the stock (which by no means can be considered cheap) while others buy it for technical reasons. My best advice is to leave the stock alone as it has more downside than upside potential.If you, like me, have a strong urge to short the stock, let it test its all time high around $32 before you do anything. If you do short the stock now, use Yelp to find a good masseuse near you because you will need some stress relief.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

877471,21950,2012-09-20T04:25:18-04:00,,"Three weeks ago, I marveled that Yelp.com (NYSE:YELP) had surged 22.7% on the heels of the lock-up expiration of its IPO but suggested that the rally provided a better risk/reward entry to bet against the stock's extreme valuation. Since then, YELP has gained another 15%, trading within a wide range for the last two weeks. The extreme skew in implied volatility has also finally settled down from a 2x difference between calls and puts to a more ""reasonable"" 1.3 (for October expiration). The stock has yet to reverse, but it is now relatively cheaper to buy puts.However, before plunging into fresh bearish bets on YELP, traders should take a step back and appreciate the opportunities for downside AND upside. The YELP counter-surge has been described as a short squeeze although the available data cannot prove this assumption. YELP short interest moved from 21.8% of the float in mid-August to 28.4% on August 31st (two days after lock-up expiration). Shares short soared a whopping 35% from 3.2M to 4.2M shares. YELP's ownership is dominated by venture capital firms instead of employees and so this setup is also supposed to explain the counter-surge. These are convenient explanations after the fact, but now that executives are selling stock, YELP continues to levitate.These were all automatic sales so more are sure to come. Given the proximity of these sales to the IPO lock-up, I think we decrease the likelihood that the absence of insider sales sufficiently explains YELP's surge. Combined with the resilience of short interest, this behavior raises the possibility that YELP could soon surge yet again.YELP has experienced three blow-off tops, each of which I have used to time some good entries for buying puts. This time, the stock is lingering just below this important level of resistance. This different behavior increases the odds that a breakout could finally happen. IF, and only if, YELP achieves a fresh all-time closing high, I think it will be time to get bullish on what could turn into another rapid rise. In fact, all YELP needs now is another catalyst that triggers more positive sentiment. The chart below summarizes the stock's short history. The dark, horizontal line describes the current all-time closing high. imageYELP lingers below important resistance - the location of three blow-off tops to-dateSource: FreeStockCharts.comSo what about the bearish case? YELP is an over-valued stock, but this valuation does not matter until the rest of the market cares. At a bare minimum, the current consolidation must break down for a new bearish trading case to make sense. That breakdown must take the stock below $24. A break below the 50-day moving average would be even better.In other words, trying to anticipate the next move in YELP is much riskier now than trying to follow the momentum.In the meantime, I am still sitting on October puts I bought with the premium from selling September puts (a calendar spread). These puts are nearly worthless now, and I do not expect to do more than breakeven on that trade. I am essentially ignoring them as I setup for the next move.Be careful out there!Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in YELP over the next 72 hours.

939841,31201,2012-10-22T17:56:20-04:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP), the ""local"" online review site, recently announced that it would be reporting earnings on November 1, 2012. The company's share price saw significant upward action in September after its initial lockup expiration period ended. The upward price movement continued through October due to Yelp's integration into Apple's new operating software map feature. There is no question that Yelp's local sales teams should have been able to benefit from the hype generated by sales of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone 5. Profitability for Yelp this past quarter should be a foregone conclusion. The more important questions are how Yelp is going to deal with Apple's massive map failure, whether it can successfully monetize mobile, and how it is going to deal with poor crowd-sourced data and fake reviews, along with whether it can survive in an increasingly crowded business segment.Local Online Review Business Segment About To Get A Lot More CrowdedYelp is likely to be one of the beneficiaries of Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) recent earnings miss. Although Yelp has never been profitable (and even Zynga was profitable at one point in time), the revenue that Google lost this past quarter had to have gone somewhere. Despite the strong likelihood of profitability, Yelp's investors nevertheless need to be concerned. Investors need to ask whether Yelp has the ability to continue generating more quarters like the one it will report on November 1, in light of the fact that the ""local"" online review business space is about to get a lot more crowded next quarter. Within the past few weeks, there have been rumors and/or announcements of many more companies that will be entering into the business space that Yelp currently occupies. Three such companies possibly looking to take advertising dollars from Yelp are Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), FourSquare, and Restaurant.com.This highlights one of the most important flaws (one of many) in Yelp's existing business model. The company has no moats. Any company with an online presence, an IT department, and local sales force (although arguably both the IT and sales force functions could be contracted out) can do exactly what Yelp does. So long as Wall Street thinks that Yelp should be valued at over $1.5 billion, there is nothing that prevents other companies like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), and LivingSocial (each with a strong online presence and brand, relationships with businesses in local markets, and a local sales presence devoted to generating local revenue) from making the decision to try to take some of those investment dollars that are funding Yelp's current lofty valuations.Most importantly, if Yelp wasn't able to turn a profit during the time when the business space it occupies was relatively empty (with the possible exception of this past quarter), why should investors expect it to become consistently profitable as more companies start joining the party?Apple Maps = FAILAfter Yelp's last quarterly earning call, the company's stock price jumped because of significant increases in overall existing and forecasted revenue projected from Yelp's integration into Apple's Maps. This integration likely helped convince local business owners to pay their pound of flesh to Yelp with the expectation that millions of future iPhone 5 purchasers would be using Apple maps. While Yelp's integration into the Apple map feature was generally considered a success, the overall map feature has been universally denounced as a failure. Even Apple CEO Tim Cook recommended that iPhone users turn to other mapping applications until the bugs in the Apple program could be worked out. To add insult to injury, it turns out that part of the problem with Apple's Maps program was that it was relying on outdated or ""dirty"" information being pulled from Yelp.The whole situation turned into a massive nightmare for Apple. Logically, if Cook told his customers to use an alternative mapping application, local businesses no longer have the same incentives next quarter to advertise with Yelp. Yelp's sales teams won't be able to rely so heavily on the Apple map marketing pitch, now that small business owners realize what a failure the Apple maps are. Additionally, taking the logic one step further, if Yelp's ""dirty"" data was part of the reason why Apple's Map application was such a large failure, the next question is whether Yelp integration will remain a prevalent feature in the Apple map application (assuming, of course, that Apple intends to truly fix its problems).Yelp - ""Dirty"" In More Ways Than OneWhile the Apple map fiasco exposed the fact that Yelp's data on business locations and addresses can often times be ""dirty,"" this is not the only thing dirty at Yelp (and no, I'm not talking about the dirty sales tactics employed by the company where sales people offered to remove bad reviews for business owners in return for a hefty monthly fee). The company's recent push to shame businesses to refrain from purchasing reviews exposes another serious flaw with Yelp's business model. Simply put, some reviews on the company's site are faked, and there is no way to control for this problem (except to shame businesses out of doing it). Sure, shaming companies who pay money for their reviews is one possible way to try to fix this problem, but what happens when companies offer patrons a discount in exchange for posting favorable reviews? Will that type of action trigger Yelp's ""badge of shame"" as well? Of course, that also begs the question, what happens if a company starts submitting lots of reviews for their competitors from one IP location, or if a company posts a fake Craigslist ad trying to buy fake reviews in the name of a competitor's business? What due process, if any, will innocent companies be given?This is where Yelp's upcoming competition has a leg up on the company. Who better than to trust than your friends? Facebook's decision to enter into the local online review business will likely mean that users will be able to filter reviews of businesses based on reviews posted by friends. FourSquare reviews will likely be limited to those individuals who have previously ""checked into"" an establishment. Restaurant.com reviews are limited to those foodies that have actually purchased and used a restaurant.com gift certificate. Amazon, Groupon, and Living Social reviews could each also be limited in the same way (i.e., limited only to those who have actually purchased and used one of their promotional offers).Unless Yelp changes its existing business model to filter out fake reviews without punishing potential customers (i.e., the small businesses who pay the site for advertising), the upcoming competition will be poised to eat Yelp for lunch.Inability To Monetize MobileDuring last quarter's earnings call, Yelp clearly indicated that it had not been able to monetize mobile revenue. Specifically, the company indicated that ""we're looking at sometime soon for mobile app monetization, we haven't announced an actual date, but it's obviously a high priority and something that we'll be doing soon."" Despite the ""high priority"" Yelp's management purportedly put on mobile monetization, Yelp has failed to provide investors with any announcements of how it will be achieving this goal. Rather, the company seems to be more focused on breaking into international markets like Poland and Singapore.While it's certainly much more fun (and more expensive) for Yelp's management team to throw lavish ""Yelp Elite"" launch parties overseas while hanging out with pretty young Eastern European and Asian ""twenty somethings,"" the company's focus at this stage should be on exploiting local U.S. markets, where it is an established brand, and on monetizing mobile revenue in the face of very stiff upcoming competition that already has a very strong mobile presence domestically (e.g., FourSquare and Facebook).Yelp better be able to give a good answer (emphasis on good) as to how it intends to monetize mobile revenue on its upcoming earnings call, otherwise, investors might start really wondering why co-founder and CEO Jeremy Stoppleman disposed of so much of his stake in the company during the months of September and October.ConclusionIf Yelp can't address the problems identified above, in addition to the many other problems identified elsewhere in other articles, then the only value it has is as a content acquisition target for another company. If that's the case, then the only question investors should be asking is whether Yelp's poorly crowd-sourced database and fake reviews are really worth approximately $1.5 billion.As Jeremy Stoppleman sold off more than $15 million worth of his stake in the company over the past two months, Yelp's own CEO doesn't seem to think so. Why should you?Disclosure: I am short YELP. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

The ""insider discipline"" was celebrated, Yelp was crowned the anti-Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in terms of post IPO performance, and the share price has since risen by 40.7%. However, Yelp is significantly overvalued at its current 1.57 billion dollar market capitalization. Yelp is a prime short candidate because much of the perceived post lockup confidence is contrived, the tremendous recent growth was driven by fallaciously impatient short covers, the stock's fundamentals are poor, and the company's business model is flawed.To its credit, Yelp has perceptive management who understand the importance of conveying confidence immediately after the lockup expiration, especially in light of the recent negative performance of Facebook, Zynga (ZNGA), and Groupon (GRPN). They knew that if they exited en masse at the lockup expiration then it would undermine investor confidence. Instead they held onto their shares at the expiration date and enjoyed the resulting positive press.However, starting a week after the lockup expiration and up until September 14, 2012, the COO, CFO, and CEO have all sold stock of varying quantities and significance. CFO Robert Krolick sold 1,000 shares on September the 4. Six days later on September 12, COO Geoffrey Donaker sold 35,000 shares. Most significantly, on September 14, CEO and co-founder Jeremy Stoppelman sold 590,790 shares. No officer has increased their position in the company since the lockup expiration. The management team both generated a share price pop from perceived insider confidence, and exited at higher prices away from the media spotlight of the lockup expiration weekend.Besides the effect of people covering their shorts after seeing no lockup day crash, there have been many other reported reasons for the rapid increase in share price over the past three weeks. People point to the fact that Yelp will be integrated in the new iOS6, that it is a likely buyout candidate, that it is expanding to Asia, and that it is well positioned for mobile. None of these purported advantages are substantial enough drivers of value to justify the current valuation.IOS6 integration should increase traffic and brand recognition, but without a clear path to monetization, these increases are not very valuable. It is very unlikely that Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is willing to leave a lot of profit on the table for Yelp in whichever capacity it cooperates on Maps or Siri integration. There have been no substantial buyout indications beyond speculation that it would be an ""acquisition target"" for a company like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). Asia does offer tremendous growth potential, but as can be seen from the failures of Facebook and Google in that area, there are often preferred alternatives already established in the Asian space. Being well positioned for mobile is an advantage it has, as their apps are effective across all mobile platforms. However, it is having the same difficulties as Facebook in determining how to monetize mobile page impressions, and in its case restaurant and business recommendations. Just because its service is more optimized for mobile than Facebook or Zynga does not mean that it is any more advanced at figuring out how to monetize mobile.As far as the stock's fundamentals, there are many areas of concern. The company has never been profitable, something that Zynga and Facebook were before their IPO. Its Price to Sales (14.95) and Price to Book (11.39) are much higher than the industry averages of .92 and 1.49. It is forgivable for a company in the growth stage of its maturation to have poor figures here, but the profitability and revenue numbers are cause for the greatest concern.Even if the company continues with the 67% YOY increase in revenue that it reported in the second quarter of 2012, and finds a way to boost net income from negative to margins into the 5 -15% range, it will be years before the company offers returns consistent with its current market capitalization. With optimistic analysts putting the earnings per share in 2013 at anywhere between $.05 and $.08 it seems unlikely that Yelp will achieve significant profitability anytime in the near future.Further causes for concern about Yelp's future profitability are the flaws in its business model. The company suffers from the same problem that other major Internet companies do in that they offer their service for free. Yelp has indicated that they are monetizing by running advertisements and by getting merchants to pay for benefits in the reviews display. The problem with this is that its mobile app is currently not profitable and they face the same problems that Facebook does in monetizing the app space with miniature banner ads. Some say that Yelp is better positioned for ad revenue because people visit the site with the intention of spending money on something. However, Yelp is not capitalizing on this advantage because only 4% of the merchants are paying for any services according to the New York Times.Additionally, Yelp faces the problem that merchants with bad reviews are not inclined to pay Yelp for anything because they resent them. Merchants with good reviews also do not feel the need to pay Yelp because they already receive an increase in traffic as free riders on the service. To make matters worse, many merchants are disenchanted with Yelp because they think that they either hide positive rankings until payment is procured, do too little to eradicate low rating trolls, or generally use predatory tactics to try and bring additional customers on board. A company so at odds with its customers is not one that is poised to experience the multi-year growth that Yelp needs to see in order to live up to its current market capitalization.Short Yelp because of the façade of insider confidence, artificial short term stock price rise caused by covering shorts, unachievable growth requirements, and flawed business model.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

But it's unclear to me how long they can keep things going.Yelp has yet to report a profit as a public company. It managed to survive the end of its lock-up period, but is now engaged in an embarrassing campaign against its own reviewers, which are increasingly subject to political interference. A lawsuit claiming it was strong-arming merchants to become advertisers was dismissed, but the company's image was harmed.The real problem is that its moat is shrinking. The threat is from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).Yelp understands this, which is why it is siccing the FTC on its larger rival. Google's purchase of Zagat, and its integration of those reviews with both its Google Plus social network and Google Places is pushing Yelp reviews down in the search rankings, unless people go directly through its own search engine or app.I know many people don't think much of Google's efforts in social networking, but the Places placement has to hurt. Enter your address into Google Maps now, and you're going to see both restaurants and a big red link to Zagat reviews. You're not going to find a link to Yelp anywhere.Can the FTC change this? Maybe, but it will take time. Google remains the dominant search engine, location is increasingly important, and Yelp is being systematically shut out of places by Google. Even links from the search engine that go to Yelp itself tend to be clunky, requiring more input and searching to gain good information.Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Bing, by contrast, has no links to reviews in its mapping function. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) would seem like a natural ally, but there's been no approach reported from either side. Yahoo (YHOO) would make another natural ally, but again -- no approach.All of which makes me wonder if the folks at Yelp even know what their problem is, if they're not lost in their little bubble world.

838521,23255,2012-08-30T13:43:13-04:00,,"Local business guide and review site Yelp (NYSE:YELP) had a wildly successful 7.2M share initial public offering (""IPO"") that saw shares surge 64% in one day as investors clamored to gain exposure to one of the larger Web 2.0 companies. Fast forward 180 days and now 52.7M additional insiders shares are available for public sale as the lockup restrictions expire. Insiders are commonly restricted from selling their shares immediately following an IPO to dampen volatility in the underlying stock. Conventional wisdom dictates that Yelp would sink like a stone with such an influx of shares available. Basic economic theory dictates that if the supply increases without an increase in demand, the market price must fall. So that's what happened, right? Not quite.Yelp enjoyed its greatest single day rally since the IPO with the stock jumping 22%. In contrast rival social networks Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) are getting hammered as early investors continue to shed their shares as fast as possible. Investors may wonder why these two similar companies acted so differently when their lockups expired. There are three reasons that separate the Yelp from Facebook and this can teach an important lesson to investors who find themselves in similar situations going forward.1. Insider Discipline: Yelp's insiders exercised restraint and did not dump their shares en mass. ""It's refreshing to see insiders with discipline,"" said Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities analyst. Mr. Pachter is spot-on as Yelp's insiders generally did not sell in the IPO and opted to express their confidence in the company. If insiders sell significant stakes at the initial offering it is a good sign that they will sell more in the future. In fairness to the insiders the Facebook offering was much larger so insiders had more pressure to sell for diversification purposes.2. IPO Size: Yelp's IPO was a much smaller than Facebook's IPO as Facebook dramatically increased the number of shares being offered mere days ahead of the IPO. By offering a limited number of shares Yelp was able to effectively make it very expensive to short the stock. It was virtually impossible for Facebook's short interest to match Yelp's short interest because Facebook was almost 100X larger at its IPO (that gap has now narrowed to approximately 25X).3. Short Squeeze: The third reason is a culmination of the first two. Confident insiders plus nervous short sellers equals a short squeeze. When the anticipated selloff did not materialize the shorts were forced to scramble and cover. This added more fuel to Yelp's increase. Facebook did not have a short squeeze because investors dumped their holdings and the shorts actually made money.Having said all this, I still have mixed opinions on Yelp. On one hand local advertising is extremely expensive which explains why the company's revenues and costs have been rising at the same rate. On the other hand Yelp is poised to experience accelerated growth as it could benefit from the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) effect. In Apple's newest mobile operating system, iOS 6, Yelp will be featured prominently in the Siri personal assistant. I continue to rate Yelp as a HOLD in this challenging environment for local businesses but the Apple halo could push shares higher in the next six months.Disclosure: I am long AAPL.

845441,32101,2012-09-04T14:55:40-04:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP), the local review website founded in 2004, has a market capitalization of approximately $1.35 billion. Following the well-publicized and successful IPO on March 2, 2012, the shares have maintained their valuation - unlike some other IPOs this year.As is typical of primary offerings, the insiders and underwriters held the cards: they get to choose the price and time of the IPO. Further, and as is typical, they sold the shares at exorbitant prices to the lowly and uninformed capital holders. Warren Buffett made this point about IPOs in his 1992 letter to shareholders:As usual, it turns out those uninformed capital holders (and buyers of the IPO) were mutual funds and institutions:(Source: Yahoo! Finance)Anyway, in the case of Yelp, it is obvious that the IPO was overpriced. In fact, the IPO was purely a way to raise money for the company since it could not raise money for itself through operations. Notice that the cash from operations has only breached into the positive territory a few times:YELP Cash Operations data by YChartsAnd while the negative cash from operations figure is almost enough to make any investment in Yelp speculative by definition, the common stock has some additional limitations an investor ought to know about.Class A verse Class BThe equity issued during the IPO was Yelp's ""Class A"" common stock - that is, the publicly traded common is ""Class A.""A ""Class A"" share, as usual, has one vote per share. The ""Class B"" shares, on the other hand, have 10 votes per share. According to page 33 of Yelp's S-1, the ""Class B"" shares - owned by ""founders, directors, executive officers and employee"" - control approximately 98.7% of the voting power. That means that ""Class A"" is absolutely powerless:If their poor operating performance - in a financial sense - cannot justify the share price, then this additional lack of power is a further insult to new Yelp shareholders.Stock Based CompensationNote also that they say that employees hold ""Class B"" shares. I mention this to point out that their share-based compensation practices are significant. Notice that the stock-based compensation figure (circled in red) is 4.8 times higher than the capital expenditure figure (in orange):(Source: June 30 10-Q, page 4)This suggests two things: (1) the share price at the grant date for the compensation was unduly high, relative to other expenses (check!) and (2) the company is relying heavily on stock based compensation - perhaps because they have some cash flow problems.Current ValuationUnfortunately, recent transactions put the market price at about $22.00 a share - which means some person (or computer algorithm) is buying the shares at a price implying a market capitalization of about $1.346 billion:Because a financial figure in isolation has no meaning, we will shortly look at this compared with the company's other operating results. But first, let us look at some other operating statistics. To repeat, operating cash flow has been mostly negative:YELP Cash Operations data by YChartsAlso, the net loss is getting worse and also the IPO was a massive share count injection.When a company is making money, increases in shares outstanding drive down the net income per share. Conversely, when a company is losing money, additional shares outstanding will drive down the net loss per share. That is to say, that the losses, in absolute terms, are 3 times worse in the six-month period from January 2012 to June 2012 than it was in the period of January 2011 to June 2011. Of course, with the massive share dilution, the net loss per share has decreased year-over-year - not, however, due to improvements, but because of increases in the share count.Perhaps it will be able to improve profit margins--and hence revenue growth justifies the current price?Assuming that Yelp is on track to record about $120 million in revenue (which would be a significant improvement over last year) and considering they presently have approximately 61,190,489 shares outstanding:Their hypothetical future price-to-sales ratio is, then, about 11. Put another way, if all of the revenue instantly became profit, the PE would be 11. But, of course, none of the revenue is profit (as it has been running losses). This is to say, having a positive profit margin will not, by itself, justify the current market valuation.Perhaps, net losses as a percent of revenue have been falling?An improvement, I suppose, but the difference is only 0.15 percent - hardly a meaningful indicator. I should also say that the main driver of the stock appears to be the revenue growth rate. Very well, let us put that in context.Does the growth rate justify the share price?Revenue is growing substantially:(Source: June 30 10-Q, page 2)But, unfortunately, the net loss is growing at a faster rate - at about 197% year-over-year:(Source: June 30 10-Q, page 2)This analysis might not be fair for various reasons. For instance, the share-based compensation (with a common stock that is overvalued relative to earnings) is a large non-cash charge against net income - hence the net income loss, in terms of cash flow, is less bad than the net income suggests.Nevertheless, let us focus on the revenue growth of 66%. Let us assume (probably wrongly) that the company can achieve a free-cash-flow margin of 10%. Free-cash-flow margin is, of course, free-cash-flow divided by revenue.Even with the assumption of a 10% free-cash-flow margin (unlikely) and  with continued revenue growth of 66%, Yelp - if the share price does not  change - wouldn't be ""fair priced""[3] till four or five years out. This is to say that it has to (1) maintain its growth for the current valuation to be sustained, but, more importantly, it (2) also has to improve its profit margins.Some Miscellaneous Curiosities from the S-1:(Source: S-1/Amendment 4, page 72)ConclusionThere is no margin of safety with this stock - in effect, a buyer today is paying for a Herculean effort in the future. Even if it turns a profit, it will need to continue to grow revenue such that it enters into a normal valuation range. Historically, the company has negative net income, negative cash from operations, and deeply negative free cash flow. Yelp might be a good service, but it is a bad stock.One other object of note, the lock-up period, which limited inside selling, ended last week. Now that the lock-up period is over, perhaps there will be additional pressure on the shares to the downside.Notes:Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Internet companies have sprouted worldwide, offering services that let us know what our friends have been up to and what they like. Yelp allows us to get a taste of the local businesses beforehand, through ratings and anecdotes.The company went public in March of this year, and the stock is up 50% since its IPO. Currently, Yelp has more than 25 million reviews of local businesses in various markets in the U.S., Canada, and other countries in Europe. It generates revenues from advertisements, display ads, and a few other deals.Data extracted from eMarketer reveals that online ad advertisement is expected to reach $62 billion by 2016. Total U.S. online advertisement spending is expected to touch $39 billion this year, up by 23.3% from last year, surpassing the aggregate spending on print newspapers and magazines. eMarketer further notes that advertisers' admiration of online ads stems from the ever-growing amount of time consumers spend on digital platforms, and from the view that the Internet is a more measurable medium.Recent DevelopmentsShort-sellers were disappointed with the post-lockup expiration rally of the stock. Hoping the stock would emulate Facebook (NASDAQ:FB)'s dive in a similar scenario, the stock jumped nearly 22% and now trades at $22.37, with nearly 53 million shares freed into the market. Several factors seem to be at play with this surprise. Short covering has definitely kicked in, but most importantly, several of the big insiders have decided to hold on to their stocks (does this spell confidence in the company?). The news seems encouraging in light of the recent plummeting of other stocks, such as Facebook and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN). What investors actually foresee in the company is a mystery to us. Venture capital backers like Bessemer Venture Partners, Benchmark Capital, and DAG Ventures have decided against selling. In the table below, you can see some of the big holders. These holders collectively own roughly 80% of the stock. Additionally (and this might explain the rally), there has been considerable hype surrounding the deal with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), announced a couple of months ago, which promises to integrate Yelp, along with Siri, into its anticipated new operating system, the iOS 6. The collaboration is purported to bring in millions of new customers very quickly, and with the deal only a few months away, investors probably had wished to sit on the sidelines and wait for the plan to materialize before going on a selling spree.On the other hand, Yelp is having trouble monetizing its mobile application. Consider this: With nearly 40% of Yelp usage now coming through mobile devices, and since the company is currently not making any money on its mobile app, Yelp must quickly find a way to turn this around. Yelp has, like Facebook, been testing small banner and text-based ads, but nothing concrete has been done to address the question of monetization.Yelp registered net revenues of $32.7 million in the second quarter, showing an improvement of 67% year over year. It also posted a net loss of $0.03 per share (up from a loss of $0.08 last year) when analysts were expecting a loss of $0.06. Analysts expect full-year revenues of $136 million in 2012 and $197 million in 2013, and net losses of $0.04 and $0.32 for the next quarter and full year ending December 2012, respectively. Like most other Internet companies, Yelp is also facing problems monetizing the ever-increasing mobile user base. Cumulative reviews stood at 30 million for the quarter, and average monthly unique visitors jumped by 52% to 78 million year over year.Also, the company must find a way to convert its ""free riding"" local business into paying customers. As yet, only 4% of businesses with profiles on Yelp actually pay for the services. Consumers can access reviews for free and, moreover, local businesses have the option of spending money on advertisements. Whether businesses will prefer paying instead of enjoying free traffic through the site remains a question.ValuationsYelp offers a nice service, but nice ideas do not necessarily generate nice profits. It remains to be seen whether Yelp can translate an idea into a profit machine. Can the company generate acceptable margins in an industry that will get more competitive with the passage of time, as rates eventually come down? There is a lot of uncertainty surrounding the business model, the methodologies the company employs to filter reviews and assign ratings, and how it plans to address the increased mobile user base.We maintain that the stock is grossly overvalued at this stage and should be sold short. Trading at above 200 times its forward earnings and above the industry average P/S ratio of 11 times, we recommend shorting the stock. EV/Sales multiple paints a similar picture, one of overvaluation. Yelp has yet to prove how its business model could lead to sustainable growth for its owners. Until and unless Yelp can present solid plans to address the issue of monetization, and explain how it expects to turn local businesses into paying customers, investors should avoid the stock.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: The article has been written by Qineqt's Technology Analyst.

A fake-out opening drop of 4.2% soon followed by a 22.7% close was definitely not on my radar. Trading volume was a YELP record of 8.8M shares (excluding the first day of trading) but nowhere close to the 52.7M shares that insiders can now sell. So it seems insiders generally decided to skip the cash register and hold onto their shares, and shorts had little choice but to rush for the exits (shorts were 21.8% of float as of August 15, 2012).Now that the stock has soared so high, THIS is the time to consider placing bearish trades. Such a trade may now seem a bit contrarian, but the options skew on YELP remains very wide. The implied volatility at yesterday's close for ""near/in-the-money"" puts was almost two times larger than calls. Options players still expect significant downside from current levels. The difference now is that the surge in the stock has greatly reduced the risk of playing that downside. As a confirming thought experiment, consider whether you prefer to sell puts when YELP is at $18 or around $22?Chart of Implied Volatilities for YELP September options(Click to enlarge)YELP options skew remains very wideSource: Schaeffer's Investment ResearchI decided to execute a calendar spread to try to take advantage of the wide skew by selling September puts to pay for going long October puts (delta neutral, meaning that ""small"" moves in YELP would not cause the spread to gain or lose money). The idea was that the September puts would expire worthless or with a significant loss while the downward gravitational pull would eventually take its toll on YELP by October expiration. With the options skew remaining high, the delta neutral calendar spread stayed roughly even throughout yesterday's rally. After YELP rallied to its 50-day moving average (DMA), I decided to increase the bearish bet by buying September puts. This positioning now gives me more protection in case YELP declines significantly in the next three weeks, but it costs me a little more if YELP does not decline at all from current levels.So, overall, I do not expect YELP to be able to hold current levels, even if the general stock market manages to rally from here.

Interestingly, the price never closed below the IPO price of 15. Here we are, back to where the stock was roughly when it opened for trading. YELP has slightly lagged the market.Fundamentally, things seem to be going very well. In the most recent quarter, the company grew sales by 67% and are up 66% YTD. Perhaps more importantly, its active local business accounts more than doubled from a year ago. The company guided for 2012 sales of $135-136mm, which represents 62-63% growth. This was an increase from prior guidance of $128-132mm. Additionally, the company had been forecasting breakeven adjusted EBITDA but raised it to $2-3mm.In a stock like this, sales are likely the key metric, and growth investors likely look out a bit. Here is how the forward sales estimates have improved since the IPO:While I wish I had looked into this company earlier, I have reviewed the SEC filings and think that this move may just be starting. My views are obviously preliminary, and I look forward to learning more about this dynamic company, but it seems to me that the shorts (3.2mm shares) are quite wrong here. The future is getting brighter.YELP is a platform that connects consumers and local businesses. The CEO, Jeremy Stoppelman, is a co-founder who has been with the company since 2004. He was VP of Engineering at PayPal and worked briefly at Excite@Home. He has built a senior team that has been in place for five years, with the exception of the CFO, Rob Krolik, who joined last summer from Move, with previous experience at eBay. COO Geoff Donaker, who joined as VP, Business Development in 2005 also worked at eBay.For all the reasons everyone seems to hate Facebook, it seems like they should like YELP. The company has been pursuing a mobile strategy since 2006, and it works on all the smartphone platforms, including Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) can't say that. Plus, the insiders are committed. In fact, not one share was sold by any insider at the time of the IPO. All 8.2mm of the shares were primary, with the exception of 50K sold by the Yelp Foundation. Bessemer and Elevation own about 22% each, while Benchmark owns almost 16%. Director Max Levchin is the largest individual holder at over 13%, and CEO Stoppelman owns almost 11%.I have to profess that I don't typically focus on such high-growth (and high valuation) companies. In my Top 20 Model Portfolio, 20 PE is quite high for any individual name. Still, I do look at companies that are less mature and that require something besides PE, such as Enterprise Value to Sales or Price to Sales. I wrote about Mako Surgical (NASDAQ:MAKO) during the summer, suggesting a great potential opportunity, and ended up adding it to the model. My target there is based on sales.Clearly, valuation is the $64K question for YELP, even if you think that the outlook is strong fundamentally. With this in mind, here is how YELP compares to some other very high-growth companies:While this is no definitive valuation call, YELP looks at least in the ballpark. These are all rapidly growing, high gross margin stories. I wanted to include Palo Alto Networks (NYSE:PANW), as it would add to my point, but they haven't reported yet. I wrote about PANW after its IPO, suggesting that it could be subject to selling pressure after the lock-up period ends in January.So, if you, like me, find the YELP story interesting, I think that improving fundamentals (as evidenced by rising sales estimates), the valuation and the chart all lead to the conclusion that it's worth investigating further.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

691501,31611,2012-06-28T19:43:13-04:00,,"Main revenue drivers of online advertising companies like Yelp (NYSE:YELP) are local advertisements and product ads. According to Yelp's business model, companies are required to either to pay fixed fee or share profits in order to take advantage of Yelp's sponsored placement. This feature allows companies to be on the top of Yelp's search and appear while viewing any related businesses. Based on the pre IPO statistics the biggest portion of Yelp clients were Restaurants (42%), Shopping (20%) and Nightlife, Beauty/Fitness and Arts (22%).A ""sponsored user"" is not necessarily a ""paying customer""Since Yelp's main operational drivers include the number of paying customers, growth of customers database and average fee per customer our analysis included more than 30 companies within various industries spread all around USA that were using local advertising services on Yelp to elicit any information regarding possible drawbacks in main revenue drivers.Impressions and information gathered from at that time current Yelp customers was very diverse. However there was a pretty interesting overlap between ""sponsored ad"" users and non-paying customers.In order to get a sponsored placement on Yelp, a business should either pay a flat fee of $300 a month or sponsor a Yelp deal with 30%/70% revenue breakdown after discount. This allows businesses to stay on the top of search and appear on pages of related businesses. However, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), as the biggest generator of traffic, doesn't give any preference to businesses that sponsor their placements and only ranks best rated companies on the top of Google search. This phenomenon doesn't allow companies with sponsored placement to get the most out of their invested capital.Another important observation was that about 40% of companies that had all privileges of sponsored placement haven't paid a penny to Yelp. It may sound surprising at first, but it turns out that once a business agrees to do a Yelp Deal promotion it automatically upgrades to a paying customer. As we were told by several business owners there are no rules or guidelines for these deals, which allows businesses to come up with any deals they want. As a result some businesses were running deals that had a very low likelihood of ever being purchased. One Mediterranean Restaurant in Georgia had a 30% off deal that offered $240 worth of food for $168 while the average menu item was priced at $7-$8 dollars. Disclosure note of this promotion mentioned that this deal can only be used from 11 A.M to 3 P.M Monday-Thursday (this restaurant doesn't serve any alcohol).People want reviews, not promotionsThe initial idea of Yelp is different from the one that Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) has. Yelp is valuable for reviews and not promotions. People realize that having a yellow square around company's name or being on the top of search with very few reviews/ratings means the business is paying for it. That's exactly the reason why many non-paying business owners will never do a sponsored placement through Yelp, because it simply destroys their value. In addition to that it sounded as if most companies that were successful in driving additional traffic through Yelp were Yelp's non-paying customers that didn't see any value in additional advertising.Even though the number of companies we conducted research on may not be enough to draw conclusions about drawbacks in Yelp's business model, it's definitely enough to see that these problems exist and may negatively impact future company's performance.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Also, Apple has started using YELP for all reviews and ratings by Siri. The positive relationship between Apple and Yelp is undoubtedly positive for YELP.Yelp Leads Social Media Stocks HigherOver the past month, social media stocks have had something of a bounce. One reason for the move higher has been the turnaround in shares of Facebook (FB), FB is now up by more than 20% over the past month. Also, shares of LinkedIn (LNKD) and Pandora (P) are higher. However, the leader over the past month has been YELP. YELP is up nearly 80% over the past month. The major outperformance suggest that the YELP move is more do to company specific fundamentals than sector fundamentals. YELP data by YChartsShort InterestAs of June 15, short interest in YELP currently stands at 2.35 million shares, or 16% of the float. It is likely that a part of the rally in YELP has been short covering. However, there are likely more shorts looking to cover as YELP continues to rally.My TakeI would not be a buyer of YELP for a few reasons. Firstly, I am not a believer in YELP's long-term business model. Also, the lockup for YELP will end in August which should lead to a major increase in the float. The end of lockup periods for Groupon and Zynga over the past few months proved to be extremely bearish for both stocks. The same is likely true for YELP. While I am not bullish, I would not sell YELP short as the high short interest leads me to believe that the short trade in YELP is crowded.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

According to Eric Savitz, 52.7M shares (Class B) are available to start trading on August 29th as Yelp's IPO 190-day lockup expires, representing a potentially tremendous flood of shares for the market to swallow. Interestingly, SEC filings show that shareholders only sold 50,000 of the 7.15M shares offered (Savitz claims none). So it is very possible YELP insiders have built up a lot of pent-up interest in selling, especially with the stock market testing multi-year highs and YELP dropping precipitously three times from the stock's highest close.Options prices on YELP clearly show the heavy expectation toward additional downside in the wake of this lock-up. There is a huge difference in implied volatility between calls and puts at the same strike price, also known as the option skew, in favor of puts. The chart below of options expiring in September comes from Schaeffers Investment Research.YELP implied volatility (as of 8/24 close) shows a large skew between calls and putsFor comparison, here are the implied volatilities of Linked.com (LNKD), an internet/social networking company with an even richer valuation than YELP's. Note the much smaller gaps between implied volatilities as traders anticipate roughly equivalent odds of moving below or above a given strike price by expiration.LNKD implied volatility for options expiring in SeptemberSource for tables: Schaeffers Investment ResearchThis comparison helps highlight the extreme nature of the skew in YELP's September options. The premium comes from anticipation of the lock-up and also recognition of the 34% drop since the intraday highs August 9th. A low (or zero!) supply of shares to short is also likely driving up the premiums on puts as replacements for shorting. Short interest is already 21.8% of the float. With bearish sentiment so high, it is tempting to be a contrarian and sell puts. I would not recommend such a trade given the high uncertainties in the downside risk from the lock-up.No one knows how many shares will unload or how quickly they will come to market. For the same reason, I have a hard time recommending buying puts. Implied volatility is likely to implode shortly after this lock-up event; YELP could drop 10% from current levels and deliver almost no gains (even losses) in all but the deep-in-the-money puts (these are closer to intrinsic value but are also much higher in price).Of the options available now, I would prefer to buy put spreads (these nullify much of the extremes in premium) or to short the stock immediately ahead of the event and look to close out the position soon after. Although a flood of shares from YELP insiders will help reduce the impact of a short squeeze, I would remain wary of YELP's ability to turn on a dime and soar double-digit percentages in a matter of days.I think the best way to play these lock-ups is to start a position far in advance. I recommended puts on YELP when it printed another blow-off top almost three weeks ago. I sold the last of those puts last week (see tweets). So, while it is tempting to set up another bearish play here, I will watch - and learn - from the sidelines here.YELP's triple topSource: FreeStockCharts.comBe careful out there!Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a short position in YELP over the next 72 hours.

(NYSE:YELP) is a very expensive stock…even with reported net revenue year-over-year growth of 64% in the second quarter. In its last earnings report, YELP was able to generate a lot of excitement by ever so slightly raising earnings and revenue guidance: (for example, for FY12, revenues to $135-136M from $128-132M). Full year revenue growth of 62-63% apparently reassured the market.Given these numbers, I was surprised to see YELP subsequently rally so strongly, but I believe this is a case where the relative context mattered. Sentiment had soured deeply on internet/social networking stocks going into YELP's announcement, and YELP managed to roll out news that could survive surface scrutiny.The stock's subsequent 17% gain was a bit exaggerated by the large sell-off going into earnings. However, more importantly, YELP managed to jump back over its 50-day moving average (DMA) and continue rallying for four more days. On the fifth day, Thursday, August 9, YELP managed to push ever higher, this time above the closing high set on March 28th. The stock was up as much as 9% on Thursday before the rally imploded on a massive reversal. YELP ended the day DOWN 3%. The chart below represents all of YELP's trading history to-date.YELP's post-earning rally comes to an abrupt end just above the all-time closing highSource: FreeStockCharts.comThe chart cannot show the magnitude of the trading volume given the large distortion from the first day of trading. The 1.8M shares traded was twice the 3-month rolling average (an intraday chart shows volume surging into the highs and off the highs of the day). This kind of massive reversal on high trading volume at an important high price point is typically a sign of a blow-off top. This is a moment where the last enthusiastic buyers rush in to buy into a story, momentum, etc.. exhausting the roster of new money willing to take the shares ever higher. Encroaching upon the vacuum is a trading/investing base that is dominated by people eager to take profits.YELP experienced a blow-off top on March 28th as well. In this case, the stock gained 37% in just three days in a move that essentially turned parabolic, quickly exhausting the inventory of new buyers and new money. The end result was a protracted sell-off that lasted two months before it bottomed with the rest of the stock market. I noted the first blow-off top as YELP made its first critical test of support post run-up. I can identify the blow-off top earlier this time because there is an easy reference point now in the all-time closing and intraday highs.YELP last printed a strong sell signal when it rallied right into the closing high before fading away from it. I described those dynamics in ""Back Into Puts As Yelp.com Fails to Establish New Highs.""YELP can only invalidate this latest strong sell signal by printing new all-time highs and following through with more momentum. I strongly suspect that YELP will at least retest the 50DMA around $21.50 before it is able to attract fresh momentum. Even so, at some point, YELP's extremely high valuation will eventually catch up to it. These repeated fades from the $28-30 level are signaling that the extremes in YELP's valuation are likely already being rejected slowly but surely.Be careful out there!Disclosure: I am short YELP.Additional disclosure: I am short YELP through puts options."
710071,32591,2012-07-09T17:26:56-04:00,,"Yelp is well over-valued at its current market capitalization of $1.6 billion.Yelp is a Silicon Valley-based social review service that allows consumers and small businesses to advertise, exchange information and post small-business reviews. Basically, registered users sign on to the site and then post to describe their experiences at small businesses. This dedicated user base (and the advertising potential that comes along with it) is what Yelp's lofty $1.6 billion valuation is built upon.Unfortunately, the integrity of Yelp's review service has recently come into question as many of the site's reviews have been flagged by media reports as either too negative, too positive or just plain not useful due to Yelp's questionable filtering system. Yelp has also been accused of burying good reviews in the hopes that businesses will pay more to enhance their listings.Even if Yelp's reviews are indeed legitimate, I argue that from a fundamental perspective Yelp as a business is over-hyped. We are looking at yet another Web 2.0 company that will likely never come close to generating the earnings that the current valuation implies.Yelp derives its revenue from selling advertising packages and banner ads to businesses hoping to catch the eye of Yelp's purported 71.4 million monthly users. Yelp's advertising packages re-direct users to the small businesses' Yelp page, where presumably the user will then discover good reviews. Last year, Yelp garnered more than 70% of its revenues from local advertising.Yet, Rocky Agrawl at Venture Beat has observed that Yelp sells advertisement packages to small businesses at over 1,000x the standard online CPM rates they can find elsewhere on the web (i.e. Facebook). This is not a sustainable strategy. Rocky argues that despite being a labeled 'social media' company, Yelp's business model is closer to that of a standard 'Yellow Pages' style company: selling questionable advertising packages to businesses who may not fully understand the model. These are likely owners who feel the need to do something to generate positive buzz and encourage good reviews. After all, a small businesses' reputation is somewhat on the line based on Yelp reviews. Is it possible that Yelp's packages are 1000x more effective for small business owners than other web-based advertising options? I would love to see the numbers, but that does not seem very likely. And it does not bode well for Yelp's sustainability once businesses' catch-on.Indeed, businesses have begun to realize that Yelp may not have their best interests in mind, as several lawsuits have emerged accusing Yelp of extortion. A recent major class action law suit was thrown out in California, representing what I believe is a Pyrrhic victory for Yelp. Indeed, the suit was not thrown out because the small business' claims were baseless. Rather, it was dismissed because freedom-of-expression laws protect sites from being sued for user content. For Yelp to survive for the long haul, they need to provide better solutions for businesses.Growing revenues, growing losses… I give Yelp's performance a 1 star review.But this negative publicity is not Yelp's fundamental problem. Like many other over-hyped online companies before it, the high costs of expanding the site coupled with an unsustainable revenue model have resulted in years of negative earnings. Yelp will likely not be able to justify raising the prices of their advertising packages any further than the already exorbitant CPM rates offered. At today's share price, the market indicates that Yelp is worth a market capitalization of $1.67 billion. Let's try to comprehend that for a second. We are looking at a company that in 8 years has never produced positive earnings and is burning through cash at an expanding rate. In Yelp's first post-IPO reporting period in May, the company posted a net loss per share of (0.31), which was over double analyst's estimates of (0.15). While revenue was up 66% on the year, net losses nearly tripled from Q1 2011. Proponents argue that a company like Yelp is still in ""growth"" or ""start-up"" mode. After 8 years of losses, when will this company be able to stand on its own two feet and stop burning through cash? The trends do not appear promising. And what if another service pops up that does what Yelp does better, or integrates more fluidly with existing social networks such as Google+, Facebook or LinkedIn?The share price has recently popped due to news that Yelp's reviews will now be incorporated into Apple's new native mapping application for iOS. The new integration will allow Maps users to check into businesses directly via the Yelp service without having to open the Yelp app. Yelp's jump in share price indicates that investors believe this announcement will drive an increase in user engagement for Yelp. Fair enough, but does this news justify a 10% jump in its already hefty valuation? I'm going to wager no, and for that reason this announcement represents a good opportunity to short a company that has a flawed business model and does not treat their core customers well (small businesses). Don't let the recent Apple announcement fool you. While Yelp as a service may have a large user-base and be known as a go-to source for small business reviews, the fundamentals reveal that Yelp is not an investment built for the long haul.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

682461,24480,2012-06-25T15:33:06-04:00,,"Why YELP is Not a Great BuyWe think long-term Yelp is not a great investment and recommend investors to use this rally as an opportunity to sell Yelp for a three major reasons.Yelp's Flawed Business Model is the Biggest WorryYelp is a website and smartphone application that facilitates a marketplace for consumers, advertisers, and small businesses to exchange information. Yelp's business revolves essentially around consumer reviews that come from registered users who post to describe their experiences at local businesses. This is the whole purpose of the site and what the company functions on. Most of their revenue comes from Yelp selling advertising packages to local businesses alongside links and banner ads for larger corporations.Yelp as a business is quickly degenerating into a train wreck. Many angered small business owners have taken to message boards and forums as ways to go on the attack and slam Yelp as an ""extortion scheme."" Local businesses believe that Yelp brass purposefully allows negative commentary to pass muster on the site, while filtering out positive feedback. In order to reverse this dynamic, local businesses report that they feel compelled to purchase expensive advertising packages on Yelp. This isn't a small share of businesses claiming 'Foul-Play' there are a significant amount of businesses out there who are on the defensive against Yelp and we think this shouldn't be taken lightly.The fact is, according to technology consultants Yelp is selling very expensive advertising packages that therefore don't make sense to many small, local businesses. Yelp is selling advertising space to small businesses at $600 per 1,000 impressions, which is 1,000 times higher than the going $0.60 rate. This is the kind of advertising budgets that financial conglomerates and big-time corporations pay not mom-and-pop restaurants selling you dinner at $15 a plate. Yelp supporters, of course, battle back defending the brand, claiming that local merchants should literally mind their own business and excel at customer service to avoid bad reviews and get their dollar's worth. We would argue, however, that the integrity of Yelp's review system and its advertising price points are myopic concerns, at best.Yelp Struggles to Produce Strong NumbersWhen it comes down to the business as a whole, Yelp struggles in the two biggest aspects they should be dominating. Recruiting new businesses to sign-up and turning current registered businesses into active paying customers. Out of the 24,000,000 local business, Yelp has only managed to turn 529,000 or 2.2% into registered users on the site. Now this is not paying users just registered. When it comes down to actual active paying business, Yelp only has managed to capture 19,000 or 0.08%.In eight years, Yelp has yet to even capture any significant portion of the market they work in.While supporters will try to sway the facts and point out this as a huge growth opportunity for Yelp, we however see it as a huge failure in their current business model and an inability to offer local businesses a service they want to pay for.The sector we agree has huge potential but we feel it will be for the taking of new competitors not by Yelp. Just analyze Yelp's most recent quarterly earnings to see the huge disparity. While the business produced strong revenue numbers they were unable to turn it into a profit with huge employees salaries being the key determinant in limiting the business. Yelp has around 300+ employees. While this might not seem like a lot when looking at social media type companies with similar valuations around $1 billion, Instagram only has 11 employees before being bought out by Facebook. You don't see anyone jumping the gun to buy Yelp even after 8 YEARS!You think with such a large sales force Yelp would excel at signing up new clients and turning them into active paying customers but frankly something is missing and we can't figure it out which is why we don't think this company is a good investment at all going forward. And we haven't even gotten into the debate about how much of Yelp's data is misleading with a large number of reviews coming from services abroad or employees themselves. No, but that's a whole another story.Yelp is Just Waiting to be Upstaged by a Better CompetitorJust like MySpace opened up the world of opportunities for Facebook, Yelp has done the same exact thing for the next competitor in line. They have developed a great product, in a vastly growing sector; the only problem is their current business model has a major flaw in it limiting them to ever become profitable. For any competitors, this is the stuff that must make them work all night and day as we see this as a great opportunity to capitalize on where Yelp screwed up. So while you can go on and say all you want about the many good things Yelp delivers and the growing opportunities, when it comes down to it the world operates on numbers and unless you are producing a profit investors will not be opportunistic about the future of your company. As a result, we think you should take this as an opportunity to get out of Yelp with the recent rally hopefully cushioning much of the blow. We just know when it comes to our Rules of Investing 'When a Business is Good, the Stock Will Follow.' Well sadly Yelp's business model is not good so the stock will never follow.Disclosure: I am short YELP."
555221,22762,2012-05-03T10:46:48-04:00,,"By Kim-Mai CutlerIn its first ever earnings report as a publicly-traded company, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) said it earned $27.4 million in revenue in the first quarter, up 66 percent from the $16.5 million it made in the same time a year ago.However, the company more than tripled its net losses, mostly on rising costs associated with supporting a larger sales staff. It lost $9.8 million, up from the $2.7 million it lost in the same time a year earlier. That loss of 31 cents per share was about double what analysts had estimated. Analysts had predicted a loss of 15 cents per share, according to a Bloomberg survey.Looking at the sheet, Yelp's loss expanded mostly on sales, marketing and administrative costs. Sales and marketing costs rose to $18.8 million, up from $11.3 million the year before. On the earnings call, the company said much of this headcount growth came from international expansion, which it has yet to fully monetize. In the first quarter, Yelp launched in 11 new markets, eight of which were international.General and administrative costs also more than doubled to $10.7 million, up from $3.6 million. But this was mostly from a stock-based compensation charge of $5.5 million related to the IPO.All this considered, Yelp is still very much in growth mode, with an expanding footprint on both the desktop web and on mobile. Yelp's average numbers of monthly unique visitors grew 53 percent to 71.4 million. Mobile usage is also up to 6.3 million unique devices per month.""From a monetization standpoint, we think mobile is better than what we have on the web,"" said Yelp chief executive Jeremy Stoppelman on the earnings call. He said the advertising the company has been running in the app is more lucrative than it is on the desktop web.Like in its initial IPO filing, Yelp broke down how its revenues are split between local and brand advertising. The company said it brought in $21.4 million in local advertising, $4 million in brand advertising revenue and $1.9 million in other services. On the call, Stoppelman pointed to new partnerships with brands like Mercedes Benz.Last year, Yelp earned more than 70 percent of its revenues from local advertising (like the improved profile pages that small businesses can pay for). It earned another 21.2 percent from brand advertising. For all of 2012, Yelp says it will bring in between $128 and $132 million. That would be up 54 percent from the $83.3 million it brought in last year.Although they spiked a little bit after earnings went out, markets are now ho-hum on Yelp's news. The company's shares are down 0.7 percent in after-hours trading to $23, giving Yelp a market capitalization of $1.39 billion.Here's the release. Original post"
782251,22148,2012-08-05T13:48:50-04:00,,"After reporting earnings on Wednesday night, Yelp (YELP) soared nearly 20% over the next two trading days. Why did this social media play jump while so many others have been falling to lows?The company connects people with great local businesses via more than 30M local reviews and approximately 78M unique visitors during Q2 2012.The main reason for the surge is that Yelp reported stronger revenue numbers that led to a solid EBITDA beat. The company also successively talked about the potential of mobile monetization though the actual results were immaterial. In reality, the company appears to have the same issues as Facebook (FB) so far.Q2 2012 HighlightsThe company reported the following highlights for Q2 2012:Analysts expected a loss of $0.06 so the reported loss of only $0.03 easily beat analyst estimates. Importantly though the total loss of $2M was slightly higher than last year. Beating analyst estimates make for a good start, but ultimately the company needs to report yearly improvements. With marketing expense at 62% of revenue, earnings will be difficult to achieve for now.GuidanceThe company provided improved guidance for the rest of 2012 as follows:Market ExpansionThe company currently operates in 90 cities with the launch of 8 new markets in Q2. This included an expansion into international markets of Denmark, Finland, and Norway.The company sees a potential of 1,000 total markets. Investors understanding this market concept is where the original valuation and hype over Yelp derailed. The company operates more as a retail operation that must build infrastructure and sales teams in each local market in order to establish a presence. Similar models exist for Angie's List (ANGI) and Groupon (GRPN) that has impacted their valuations as well.Naturally the scale and speed of developing markets is much quicker than opening a new restaurant, but it still isn't the model envisioned when people thought that these companies could grow exponentially without a massive sales force.MobileThe mobile app was used on 7.2M mobile devices per month in Q2, up 70% year-over-year. An astonishing 40% of Yelp searches are now conducted on the mobile apps, becoming a majority on the weekends.Unfortunately though the company only makes money on the optimized mobile website and not the mobile app. The good news though is that the mobile website has a higher click through rate on local ads than that on desktops.Mobile provides the ultimate holy grail for local ads as consumers click on the mobile website or app to find a good local store. Businesses clearly want to advertise to the consumer within a local area looking for a store than a general person watching TV only half paying attention to commercials.Monetizing that local traffic on apps will ultimately determine the direction of that company.ValuationThe company guided up for Q3, but it will still be losing money. Not much hope exists for profits in 2013 either. Nor should investors clamor for current profits on a company with growth potential of over 1,000% once all the currently identified markets are established.The company claims to have huge scale once a market becomes established. Unfortunately, the stock trades at over 10x revenue based on 2012 estimates. That multiple has already priced in significant growth considering profits are currently non-existent.ConclusionThis company remains difficult to value considering the large sales and marketing expense required to build and establish each market. What profit margins will be achievable long term? Will competition ultimately drive down ad rates? Will enough advertising dollars exist in a few years as all the social media concepts rely so heavily on ad supported services?The concept of a user review network that allows users to quickly find the top reviewed stores or restaurants is a very useful business model. The ability to monetize that concept at higher rates than expenses remains the big question. A great free service to consumers doesn't always translate to a profitable business.Yelp remains worthy of watching, but the valuation and ability to monetize mobile traffic remains a bigger concern.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

554201,23255,2012-05-03T03:42:01-04:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) reported its first ever quarterly financial results as a public company yesterday and they were ripe with information about this young firm. As with many young technology companies that I follow, Yelp has a multitude of encouraging and negatives aspects that require careful analysis. As I did with Netflix, my objective here is to provide you with a rapid reaction of the quarter and to serve as a starting point for further research into the company.Netflix had its IPO in March at $15 but most ordinary investors had to settle for a purchase price in the low-to-mid $20s. Despite rallying to $28 in late March, the stock has been on a steady decline and investors who purchased at $25 are sitting on an approximate nine percent loss. In contrast, much larger competitor Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is up more than ten percent, despite getting flak for its synthetic split.(Source: Yahoo Finance)Here is a sample of the headlines following the earnings release:While all of these headlines are accurate, none of them provide a comprehensive picture. Yes, revenue was up sharply but that does not tell the entire picture. It is also true that the net loss greatly expanded, but the real question is why? Investors cannot simply rely on the basic news stories when making important investment decisions with their own money.Here are the highlights you need to know:Should Yelp really get that much credit for growing revenue and expenses at the same rate? A sixty percent growth rate is quite impressive, but the shine is greatly diminished when it is accompanied by a dramatic increase in marketing expenses as well. Furthermore, guidance for second quarter revenue is only $29M, indicating that growth is already slowing.The surge in general and administrative expenses relates primarily to share-based compensation, which also was the most significant cause of the sharp decline in earnings. Most news stories will zero-in on these increased G&A costs and decline in earnings but that is not the alarming part. This is another classic example of why you need to dive deeper when your own money is on the line.Overall, I like Yelp as a service and it is not a poor choice for a stock. I would be hesitant to make a large bet against Yelp because it is one of the popular young technology companies that could be buoyed by the upcoming Facebook IPO. I do not believe a decline to the low twenties is out of the question but that would bring the market cap closer to $1B.Ask yourself this, if Instagram with no revenue is worth $1B to a larger rival, how much could Yelp be worth to Google, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), or even Facebook? As a standalone company I am worried because local advertising growth is expensive to procure and I would bet on larger competitors to have the resources to win this battle. Look to invest your money elsewhere and be very careful if you decide to short this potential acquisition target.Disclosure: I am long AAPL, GOOG."

This move comes after YELP had rallied strongly on both Wednesday and Thursday. Click to enlarge images.OversoldPrior to the move this week, YELP shares had been down nearly 50% from their all-time high reached in late March. Part of Friday's move is likely related to how oversold YELP had become.Facebook RallyAnother possible reason for the strength in YELP is the move higher in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The move lower in FB since the IPO has had an adverse effect on almost all social media plays, including Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), Renren (NYSE:RENN), LinkedIn (LNKD), and YELP. The move higher in FB on Friday could be playing a role in the move higher in YELP, as investors are possibly warming up to social media stocks.Short InterestShort interest in YELP currently stands at 2.4 million shares, or 16.3% of the float. It is likely that a part of the rally in YELP is short covering.My TakeI would use the rally to sell YELP for a couple of reasons. First, and most importantly, I tend to agree with the negative thesis about YELP's business model outlined here. Second, the lockup in YELP will end in August, which will lead to a major increase in the number of shares of YELP that are trading. The end of lockups in other social media stocks, such as Zynga and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), has led to major declines. I believe YELP likely faces a similar fate later in 2012.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
410531,22110,2012-03-05T04:08:50-05:00,,"Yelp’s (NYSE:YELP) 64% opening day bounce on its IPO and the resulting $1.4  billion market cap for the unprofitable Web 2.0 site remind me a lot of  the bad old days. And I’m apparently not the only one.Opening at $15 and closing at $22 was a shock to one analyst quoted by the Merc, who focused on the plethora of local advertising competitor:As with Web 1.0 companies, the social media  companies hope to attract eyeballs and stickiness to build network  effects to keep out potential competitors. Much as it was 15 years ago,  the goal is to grow fast (despite the obvious risks) or die trying.The  problem — as noted by many analysts — is the idea of a point-product  web offering seems a bit passé. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) , LinkedIn (LNKD), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Foursquare and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and others are all trying to crowd each other’s  market — with mixed results. Nonetheless, a plan of using market share  and IPO wealth to keep out startup rivals doesn’t work so well when  faced with a Google (or soon-to-be-public Facebook).One recent trend is the tendency to use a small float and thus artificial scarcity of stock to create a sense of urgency among investors and thus support the stock price. As theWall Street Journal reported:Don’t get me wrong. I love  Yelp, find it invaluable for finding a restaurant in a strange location,  and wish it nothing but the best. However, it’s beyond me how  it can sustain a billion-plus market cap with a -19% profit margin and  such a bevy of powerful competitors."
410791,25120,2012-03-05T06:42:59-05:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is a website that shows reviews for local businesses. The company made its public debut on Friday. There was great demand for the company's shares, which were offered at $15 per share. The opening trades took place at $22 per share and shares ended the day 64% higher to close at $24.58, valuing the company at $1.5 billion.The offeringUnderwriters set the initial price range at $12-$14 per share, but eventually Yelp sold 7.1 million shares at $15, thereby raising $107 million. Given the great success, the underwriters will undoubtedly exercise the green-shoe clause thereby selling another 15%, or roughly 1 million additional shares, raising the total amount of capital raised to $122 million. Analysts are enthusiastic about the offering, citing that the IPO market is becoming ""hot"" again ahead of the much-anticipated offering of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).Business modelCEO Jeremy Stoppelman sees ""local"" as an overlooked opportunity by bigger firms. The former EBAY (NASDAQ:EBAY) employee who left in 2002 started Yelp in 2004 and has expanded the website to a point where it now holds 25 million reviews and attracts 66 million unique visitors per month. Stoppelman believes that focusing on local environments allows for much more targeted marketing efforts and thus higher advertising rates for companies like Yelp.CompetitionYelp has one direct competitor which already went public last year. Angie' List (NASDAQ:ANGI) which went public in November 2011, saw a first day return of 25% when shares closed at $16.26. Shares in that company fell 5.5% on Friday in reaction to the successful IPO of Yelp and now trade at $15.25- which values the company at $1 billion.Besides the direct competition from sites like Angie's List, there are always the usual tech moguls which could become sizable competitors anytime. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) bought restaurant review company Zagat last year, while Facebook already offers the possibility to review the outlet at which visitors have ""checked-in"".ValuationLike many IPOs, Yelp is not yet profitable. It saw spectacular growth in recent years, but at the same time saw losses expanding as well. For the full year of 2011, Yelp generated $83 million in revenue on which it lost $17 million. At this metric, the company is valued at 18 times revenues.In comparison, Angie' List generated $90 million in revenue in 2011, but it lost a staggering $48 million. Angie's revenue multiple comes in at 10 times. The greater losses of Angie's do threaten the financial security in the medium term as the company burns through its entire cash position in two years, at this rate.Besides the fact that Yelp has lower losses, it also shows much faster revenue growth. In 2011, Yelp showed 73% revenue growth vs. 50% for Angie's List, and the company is on track to surpass its competitor in total revenues for 2012.Volatile returnsValuing a business like Yelp is incredibly difficult to do. The public offering, which showed a massive 65% first day return, proves that the issue price was on the low side. This is despite the fact that the official offering price of $15 had already been raised from its initial guided offering range of $12-$14.Future returns will be determined by revenue growth, margin improvement, but foremost by the possible entry of much bigger competitors such as Facebook or Google.If those companies become serious about the ""local"" concept, great returns can be achieved if they prefer to acquire the likes of Yelp. If the companies decide to built their own platform, the future looks less bright.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
467361,25258,2012-03-29T22:51:25-04:00,,"One month since its initial public offering (IPO) was completed, social media darling Yelp (YELP) appears to have been declared a raging success by its current investors. Having raised $107 million from its initial public offering, the company that originally priced at $15/share opened significantly higher only to end the first day of trading at $24.58/share. Within a few short weeks, the stock incurred a volatile swing that dipped the company over 20% to the downside and subsequently rallied for more than a 50% gain bringing it to its latest closing price of $28.01 as of March 29, 2012.Such swings have become typical for social media companies in particular, where similar results have been seen in the aftermath of IPOs for popular social companies such as Groupon (GRPN), LinkedIn (LNKD), and Pandora (P). The market pricing uncertainty has been propagated by the popularity captured by the very business model of the companies themselves. People want to invest in what they daily use. And with the proliferation of online access that increased trading capability and Internet familiarity, they now can.Yet when reality comes to the investing world, companies will eventually align with their earnings potential. For social companies like Yelp, the business model has seemingly limited monetization pathways that could be effectively implemented without frustrating the company's user base or disrupting the convenient use of their product. After all, users don't want to feel as if they're being exploited for ad revenue. Yet to bring the company to accelerated profitability such methods are going to have to be implemented with care. Limited barriers to entry will also allow competitors to test the company's market share time and time again. According to its S-1 filing, Yelp back in September 2011 had a loss from operations of $7.4 million. This was but a slight improvement from the same time period a year prior where the company had loss $8.5 million. For a company that only had $42 million in total assets in September 2011, adding another $100 million serves as a useful lifeline. Yet with the current market capitalization of $1.68 billion, one must wonder what it is investors are truly expecting from this company.In stark contrast, exploring the lesser known companies that have had their IPOs within the last year can lead to some interesting finds. Take Solazyme (SZYM) for instance, who's IPO raised $227 million in May 2011, and currently trades with a market capitalization of $866 million. As seen in this video of the CEO Jonathan Wolfson talking about the company's IPO process, the value proposition that Solazyme brought to the table was a disruptive technology to the world's largest market:Whether it be sugar from sugar cane, sugar beets, corn-based dextrose, or a variety of cellulosic materials, Solazyme's technology allows for a conversion process of the one of the world's most abundant resources found in carbohydrates into one of the world's most commonly used products: oils. Whether it be oils used for jet fuels, cooking oils, lubricants, cosmetics, or paint thickeners, Solazyme is able to create it.The company is able to create specialized oils that have yet to be found in this world and customize it to fit for specific purposes to industry. It's for this reason that Dow Chemical (DOW) for instance is willing to buy 20 million gallons of Solazyme's oils in 2013, and up to 60 million gallons in 2015. In the same sense, it's why Unilever (UL) has expanded into multiple research agreements with Solazyme varying from tailored soap products to tailored food products.Most importantly, it appears that the company will be able to perform in a very cost effective manner. Prior to even building any of its own production facilities, the company was able to commercialize its technology and become profitable in its skin & personal care division that exploited ""low to no capital expenditure requirements"" (refer back to video, starting from 11:50). With an addressable market opportunity in excess of a hard-to-fathom $3.1 trillion, Solazyme's market size potential is far from small.With such distinct differences between the IPOs of Yelp and Solazyme, it remains almost disheartening that the populist investment base seems overwhelmingly biased. Companies like Yelp have all the short-term attractiveness that revolves around hype and popularity rather than the fundamentals that stock prices eventually come to reflect. All the while, a company like Solazyme that is projected to make revenues north of $1 billion annually by 2015 (when contrasted to the $39 million it made for fiscal 2011) stands in the investing shadows with little to no media coverage.Perhaps in a society where attention spans and short-term gains far outweigh the benefits of game-changing success, this contrast makes more sense than one might believe. Yet for readers of this article, I encourage you to do your due diligence and use your mind before seeking positions in either of these companies. Everyone has their own sense of value and risk-aversion, and it's important to understand what it is that you partake in rather than blindly following the words of one person to the next.Disclosure: I am long SZYM.Additional disclosure: I am also short YELP"
494801,25258,2012-04-12T15:36:44-04:00,,"As the quiet period came to an end for recent IPO Yelp (YELP), star analysts released their opening stances for the social review site on Wednesday. What could be clearly seen as the opening review of Yelp was surprisingly less than positive. Not a single analyst provided a ""buy"" or ""outperform"" rating. This was somewhat peculiar considering that all four analysts worked for the banks that served as the underwriters of the popular company's initial offering. With somewhat tacit candor, it appears as if the lack of enthusiasm over Yelp's current valuation sends a clear warning to investors that their positions might be stretching the upper limits of a rational valuation.The reviews came in as follows:As of April 11, 2012, Yelp ended the day with a closing price of $25.43 per share. In doing so, the star internet company continues to support a lofty market capitalization of $1.52 Billion. Yet this market valuation appears to come in stark contrast to those deduced by income and cost. According to the company's S-1 Filing, the following observations can be seen:(Click to enlarge)Despite all logic, the market valuation remains high for Yelp on the anticipation of future growth and the ever-present possibility of a buyout offer. With such speculation on hand by an audience drawn to the popularity made possible by Yelp's business model, one begins to wonder how long it will take before the market begins to realign itself to the company's fundamentals. One look at social internet peer Groupon (GRPN), and it becomes pretty clear to see that bubbles aren't meant to be endured forever. Yet until that day, it appears investors are more than eager to delude themselves into thinking that Yelp will soon be able to turn a sizeable profit to justify its current price tag. Indeed, they might be waiting for some time.Disclosure: I am short YELP."
528611,22271,2012-04-25T16:21:09-04:00,,"Similar to pets.com, Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is a dog of a stock. Certainly, Web 2.0 and pets.com reincarnated supporters will bark, wail, yelp, beg, scratch, and claw for this stock to remain relevant, right before things hit the fan, shares collapse, and Yelp positions go out with a whimper. Yet again, we are forced to deconstruct the economic merit of another novel Internet idea that went public and cashed out for $1 billion at the top. Accommodative Federal Reserve Board policies, alongside unrealistic business expectations, serve as catalysts to lead us on this death march toward zero.The Federal Reserve BoardThe Federal Reserve Board is an apolitical entity that functions to achieve a contradictory dual mandate of full employment and stable price levels. The Federal Reserve works to influence the economy largely through its overnight lending rate. Member banks borrow money from each other at the overnight lending rate to meet their reserve requirements at the Fed. Logically, the overnight lending rate serves as a benchmark for all credit securities. Creditors demand higher returns on their investments relative to the minimal risks that banks incur when loaning reserves out to each other. Amid a recession, the Fed will drive rates lower in hopes that people will take out loans, purchase big-ticket items, and put money to work within financial markets to stimulate the economy.At present, the federal funds rate is zero. The federal funds rate has remained at zero since Q4 2008, in response to a parade of boom-and-bust economies that began with the dot-com bust and ultimately transitioned into a credit debacle. With interest rates significantly beneath inflation, investors have embraced risk in hopes of generating real returns. These are the makings of a bubble.Right now, I feel that Yelp and the entire Web 2.0 complex is yet another example of cheap money fluff that is doomed to fail.Yelp Share PriceOn March 2, 2012, Yelp made its public debut to much fanfare. Initially priced at $15, Yelp shares rocketed up on their first day of trading to close at $24.58. On the surface, the 60% opening day surge had the markings of a successful IPO. I would argue, however, that lead bankers at Goldman Sachs underpriced demand for the offering, collected their fees, and left money on the table that Yelp could have used to finance operations. In the two short months following its IPO, Yelp approached $32 per share, before settling in at $22 on April 23, 2012. Today, Yelp posts a $1.2 billion market capitalization.Yelp's S-1 filing, however, indicates that this corporation never turned a profit between 2006 and 2011. Losses have actually been mounting, as Yelp builds out its sales staff for increased visibility and market penetration. Although revenue has taken an elevator ride from $443,000 in 2006 to $47 million in 2010, costs and expenses from operations also levitated from $2.7 million to $57.2 million during this time frame. In total, Yelp closed out 2010 with $9.7 million in net losses. Even happy-go-lucky speculators who highlight cash flow figures must note that Yelp's cash flow from operations has fluctuated wildly over the past three years, from negative $633,000 to negative $7.8 million to a positive $250,000 between 2009 and 2011. By year-end 2011, Yelp had gone on to lose $5.3 million from its 2010 cash position.I cannot justify paying a $1.2 billion valuation for any stock that posts significant losses and continues to burn through cash. At these levels, Yelp investors must be willing to make the argument that either online advertising is set to capture the lion's share of traditional print dollars, or that this company is a prime takeover target for established Internet players.Yelp's Flawed Business ModelYelp is a website and smartphone application that facilitates a marketplace for consumers, advertisers, and small businesses to exchange information. Central to Yelp's model are consumer reviews that registered users can post to describe their experiences at local businesses. From there, Yelp can market advertising packages to local businesses alongside links and banner ads for multinational corporations.Yelp, as a crossroads for Internet traffic, is quickly degenerating into a train wreck. Irate small business owners have taken to various message boards to go on the attack and slam Yelp as an ""extortion scheme."" Unwitting merchants believe that Yelp brass purposefully allows negative commentary to pass muster on the site, while filtering out positive feedback. In order to reverse this dynamic, local businesses report that they feel compelled to purchase expensive advertising packages on Yelp. According to technology consultant Rocky Agrawal, Yelp is selling advertising space to small businesses at $600 per 1,000 impressions, which is 1,000 times higher than the going $0.60 rate. I feel that only financial conglomerates that close six-figure deals should pay a premium for online advertising. Alternatively, mom-and-pop restaurants that offer spaghetti at $15 a plate are better left alone.Yelp supporters, of course, will battle back and claim that local merchants should literally mind their own business and excel at customer service to avoid bad reviews and get their dollar's worth. I would argue, however, that the integrity of Yelp's review system and its advertising price points are myopic concerns, at best. Right now, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and its search engine machine is responsible for roughly half of all Yelp traffic. At any moment, Google could re-engineer its own search algorithms to direct consumers toward its upgraded in-house suite of quasi-review sites, such as Google+ or Google Maps, and steal share. Google, of course, would only aggressively enter this arena at the exact moment that Yelp was to flash any signs of life.Yelp will be finished if Google ever decides that it wants to come out and play.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

409931,24663,2012-03-04T10:58:12-05:00,,"Most likely, if you were one of the many who placed a buy order for Yelp (NYSE:YELP) at the open on Friday then you lost money. The stock opened at $22.01 but was then $24.65 in a blink of an eye. The stock then reached $26 before retracing to trade at a fairly consistent level for most of the day. The stock does trade with an attractable market cap (considering other social networking companies) and has significantly increased revenue year-over-year but is also seeing a decrease in margins. Therefore, it has positives and negatives but still a large amount of uncertainty.It's way too early in the company's existence to know if Yelp would make a good investment, therefore I am not going to make a recommendation or prediction one way or the other. I think it has a strong platform and a possibility to succeed, but with all these social networking companies it's beginning to feel a bit like the dotcom era. I currently do not own any of the social networking companies, however I do play several of the IPOs with a trend that I have identified that returns a significant amount on an investment. And I believe that Yelp will almost certainly follow the same trend.I have followed nearly all of the high profile internet based company IPO's over the last year; and all but one follow a very distinct pattern. They have all traded significantly higher at open but are then followed by a downward trend. But what's interesting is that each and every stock that follows this trend reverses to post gains near 50% in a short period of time.On November 29 I wrote and published an article ""Groupon Following The Trend Of Past IPOs"" in which I identified, called, and explained this trend. During the 10 days that followed this article, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) returned a 54% gain, and successfully executed this trend. However, GRPN is not the only stock that has followed this trend. Below is a list of five notable IPOs during the last year that were deemed ""high-profile"" that followed this trend. The first set of percentages are the margin at which the stock fell from its high and the second set is the margin at which the stock increased after the fall.Each and every one of the companies above is different and has very few similarities with the others. However, the one similarity that every stock shares is that each posted large gains the day of its IPO, then fell shortly after, and posted large gains from its low. Unfortunately, there is no standard for when this trend will take place, but it always occurs within the first few months of the stock's IPO. As a rule of thumb, I always wait for the stock to decline 40% from its high and then I wait for one day of gains before purchasing the stock, which means the trend wouldn't occur until YELP reaches a price around $15, possibly $13.People often ask why this trend occurs, and my response is usually ""I don't know."" There is no specific reason for this trend to occur but as an investor who places a large emphasis on behavioral finance I do have a theory. I believe the reason that the stock posts such massive gains when it begins trading is because investors want to buy a highly anticipated stock that has received a large amount of coverage by the media, and because they believe that stocks return the best gains on the day of its IPO. I think the stock then falls as a domino effect.Unfortunately, investors never have the opportunity to buy the stock at its IPO price, and are forced to buy at the open price, which could be 40-60% above its IPO. As a result, when the momentum begins to fall and investors take profits the domino effect is initiated and investors sell to limit loss from the high premium they were forced to pay. Finally, once the stock reaches a price that investors perceive as a value then another domino effect begins and those who first bought because of the optimism are dragged back into momentum of the stock. Of course this is speculative, and lacks fundamental analysis, but it's my personal belief of why these high profile speculative stocks follow this trend.As I said, there has only been one occasion when this trend was unsuccessful, and it was with Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA). Prior to Zynga's IPO I wrote an article in which I called the same trend for ZNGA. But for some reason, ZNGA did not follow the same trend, most likely because it was the first of these IPOs to trade lower during its IPO. Therefore, since it never traded higher on its IPO it doesn't count for this particular strategy, but it's still considered a stock in this category of companies.I will conclude by saying that I have only found this trend in a certain class of stocks: high profile internet based companies or social media. It does not work on companies such as Michael Kors (KORS), probably because there is less uncertainty surrounding companies with established locations that are not primarily operated through the internet. I can't tell you exactly when this trend will occur, and this stock may be the first to pop on its IPO but not follow the trend. But as an investor, be on the lookout, and if the stock begins to fall and it reaches a price that is 40% off its high, then wait for one day of gains, and ride it higher to a quick 40-50% return.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The website offers users free reviews (also written by users) for a variety of businesses from restaurants to dentists to plumbers, etc. After starting their operation in San Francisco in 2004, the company has grown to 71 cities in 13 countries. In the last quarter they had approximately 66 million unique visitors to their website and 5.7M users of unique mobile devices. Yelp monetizes their platform primarily through targeted advertising, comprised of Local Ads (typical text based search advertisements) and Enhanced Listings. Local revenue is typically 3, 6, or 12 month programs that range from approx $300-1000 per month. Brand Advertising is for larger or national operators and is impression based and CPM. Other services include: Deals, Partners, and Remnant Advertising.The company competes with companies such as Angie's List, Citysearch and Google places. Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI) is a good comp based on the size of the company (in revenue terms) as well as the fact that they just went public in Nov. 2011. ANGI priced at $13.00, opened day one at $18.00, closed day one at $16.26, and is currently about the same level at $16.12. The big difference between ANGI and YELP is that ANGI charges their users a subscription fee, where as YELP is free. Both receive a large portion to majority of their revenue from advertising. ANGI believes the paid subscription makes their user base more engaged. Regardless if this claim is true or not, both have shown that as their markets age: reviews increase, revenues increase, and profits follow. Both companies are losing money at this stage, but that is primarily due to their increased expenses from expanding into new markets.Revenue has grown from $12.1 million in 2008 to $83.3 million in 2011 (the 2011 revenue was up 74% year over year). Adjusted EBITDA for 2011 was negative $1.1 million. However, the company said that this included an investment of approximately $7 million in 14 new markets which brought no revenue in 2011, and without this investment their adjusted EBITDA for the year would have been positive. The investment in additional markets is expected to continue, however, with approximately $15 million expected for international growth in 2012.While the IPO of Facebook looms in the background, there has been much public debate about valuations of social media companies and whether we are experiencing a dot com bubble part two. A number of high profile social media companies that have gone public in the last year, including LinkedIn (LNKD), Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN), Angie's List , and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA), were met with heavy demand in their IPO debuts. Though there has been a great deal of volatility in these names, all of these companies are currently trading above their IPO prices, with the exception of Groupon which is currently just below their IPO price of $20. While it may be hard to argue in favor of these social media stocks from a valuation perspective, it is not hard to argue against there rapid growth as well as their disruptive nature within their particular segments. Which brings us back to the stock in question, Yelp, and is it worth over 15x trailing sales (based on the $22 opening price this am)? Time will tell, but one thing looks pretty certain and that is Yelp made those investors that got shares at the IPO price very happy this morning.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
408731,21369,2012-03-02T16:24:22-05:00,,"By David UraniLately I've enjoyed doing a bit of market cap analysis on some of the recent internet IPOs. Obviously these are getting a lot of hype, and with Facebook ready to enter the mix this year the new money crowd is getting antsy. Enter today's IPO of Yelp (NYSE:YELP) which after being initially priced at $898.1 million, is trading up more than 60% in its market debut to give it a market cap of approximately $1.5 billion. Looking into its numbers though, it becomes a little hard to justify. Here are 3 key metrics for Yelp from 2011:Okay, the 74% revenue growth is the highlight here but for a ""hot"" internet stock, we've seen better. Recent IPOs like Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) and Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) posted revenue growth of 91% and 519%, respectively, and those companies enjoy much higher revenue on an absolute dollar basis as well. Not only that, but Yelp has already been around for 8 years and the company even said itself that revenue growth will slow as the business matures.And, in those 8 years that Yelp has been around the fact it is still running at a loss worth 20% of its revenue is not necessarily encouraging. In fact, its loss increased to $16.7 million in 2011 from $9.6 million in 2010.Yelp's market cap of $1.5 billion puts it right around the same value of one of our favorite restaurant stocks, Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD), the up and coming wing chain. BWLD doesn't quite show the same revenue growth as Yelp, with 28% versus Yelp's 74%, but with sales of $784.5 million it makes 9.4 times that of Yelp. If we do some back of the envelope analysis and assume just for fun that both companies maintain their current growth rates indefinitely, it will take Yelp 8 years to pass up Buffalo Wild Wings.And remember, this isn't accounting for net income; as of now we don't know when, or if, Yelp will start turning profits. Yelp itself says it expects its costs to continue to increase. In the meantime Buffalo Wild Wings made $50.4 million last year, up from $38.4 million.Sure, internet companies often deserve their growth premiums but after Friday's debut frenzy Yelp is looking too lofty if you ask me.For comparison's sake, here are some comparisons of companies in the $1.5 billion market cap range:"

393921,23395,2012-02-27T06:10:26-05:00,,"Local reviews website Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is looking to continue the internet IPO  resurgence this week. The company is expected to offer 7.2 million  shares on Thursday, March 1st at a price range of $12 to $14. Trading on  the New York Stock Exchange should begin on Friday under the symbol  YELP. Yelp is one of seven deals on the calendar this week.For 66 million people each month, Yelp is the destination for user  reviews on a variety of local businesses, especially restaurants (42% of  reviews) and shopping (20%). To date, the site hosts 25 million  reviews, covering local businesses in 46 US and 25 international  markets. Revenue is primarily generated through local advertising (e.g.  enhanced listings; 70% of 2011 revenue) and display advertising from  national brands (21% of 2011 revenue). Yelp Deals, launched in the  second half of 2010, allows merchants to offer discounts through the  website for a fee. Yelp also has partnerships with OpenTable (NASDAQ:OPEN), Orbitz  (NYSE:OWW) and  third-party advertising networks."
399831,26711,2012-02-29T02:55:16-05:00,,"Reading Yelp's (NYSE:YELP) IPO prospectus, it's hard not to notice the irony in Yelp righteously proclaiming their CEO testified before congress regarding Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) stealing user reviews. Yelp seems to be upset that Google would attempt to index and summarize its 25 million user-contributed reviews (28% of which are perceived as less than authentic) into its own product. Based on the risks outlined in the IPO prospectus, Yelp believes Google constitutes a major threat to its ability to make money in the local-business-review market. What Yelp seems to take for granted however is the large degree to which they need Google's cooperation in order to maintain and grow their business.Unlike the oft-reported ""halo-effect"" between Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) in which the two companies acting together make each other stronger and more profitable, Google has little to gain from its relationship with Yelp. At the same time, Yelp's business absolutely depends on Google letting them have preference over Google's own offerings.Google Local is much like Yelp in that it allows users to leave reviews for local businesses. Google Local also lets users find specific types of products and services in their local area and lets business owners interact with customers directly. Other peripheral services like Google Offers almost directly mirror Yelp Deals, while Google Maps is integrated heavily into both Google Local and Yelp.Yelp essentially lives on top of the combination of Google Maps and third party business data providing an alternative database to which users feed reviews.The Yelp business model seems sound until you realize the degree to which Yelp relies on Google to funnel organic search visitors (those that are provided at no cost) to Yelp. The links in Google's search results generate over 50% of Yelp's search engine referral traffic while taking users away from Google's own offerings. Yelp admits they don't have any notable user acquisition expenses because of this relationship with Google. Unlike Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) which sends users deals through email bypassing Google's portal, Yelp relies on free links from Google to bring in visitors.If Google decided tomorrow that it would favor users being directed to its own review system where Google makes money selling ads, Yelp's business would instantly be in serious trouble.In my review of Yelp's competitors, I have found over 20 relevant local review sites that offer all the same business review capabilities as Yelp. Many of these competitors actively encourage Google to aggregate their content. The indexing of user reviews leads to more traffic as Google often only posts teasers of full reviews along with direct links to the original review company's site.In addition, the review company sites themselves often aggregate each others reviews providing a much larger range of local business feedback. Ultimately you get the same reviews on any site with companies competing for the best tools and interface. It seems clear that as time progresses, Yelp's continuance in desiring a closed site in an environment where others are sharing reviews will make them less relevant.After taking into account the potential disadvantages Yelp has in review breadth, one should also consider another difference between Yelp and Google: the way in which each generates revenues. Google offers Adwords to businesses on a mostly self-service platform that integrates directly into Google Local and Google Maps. Advertisers have come to widely adopt this platform as is evidenced by Google's tremendous search engine advertising success. Yelp on the other hand relies on a large team of salespeople to call local businesses offering them 3, 6, and 12 month advertising plan commitments at a cost of $300 to $1000 per month.Yelp's sales force is expensive and eats away at any potential profits. Last year over 100% of Yelp's revenues were consumed by the costs of running the site, sales and marketing, general and administrative costs, and its charitable contribution, leaving a large deficit for a company determined to grow. The sales and marketing expense alone was 65% of revenue which is proportionally the largest reason why Yelp has never earned a profit. Yelp's reliance on sales people demonstrates an obvious inability to draw in enthusiastic customers with minimal staff in the way Google does.Yelp's 20+ established competitors, owned by a range of companies like AT&T's (NYSE:T) Yellowpages.com and IAC's (IACI) Citygrid Media are calling the same businesses and selling the same high-cost advertising plans for their own sites. The well established competitors will be working to take away Yelps market leading position while Yelp poses no obvious barriers to letting others overtake its lead. The sales business model itself can be rather simple as well: hire commissioned sales people to sell $300 to $1000 per month advertising plans and offer 50% of revenue to each sales representative. The potential for bringing in large numbers of commission-only sales people is very high and requires virtually no capital.Finally, even if Yelp ultimately does succeed in taking on its competitors and Google, their eventual downfall may come from the fact that they don't own any technology patents. Companies like Google hold large patent portfolios both for licensing income and to deter potential legal attacks. In this comparison, and in many others, Yelp doesn't stand a chance against Google.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
410151,25258,2012-03-04T13:20:44-05:00,,"The 'Social IPO Frenzy' spreads as Yelp Inc. (NYSE:YELP) stages another coup with its much anticipated offering on March 2, 2012. After pricing above its targeted range of $12-$14/share to $15/sh, this popping ""where-to-go-to-review"" company surged 63.47% by day's end with a closing price of $24.58/sh.Somewhat surprisingly, the company did little to boost the sector which had seen a correlative boost from Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) pricing not too long ago. Quite often the hot IPO first day successes had helped lift the sector collectively as investor confidence rose in light of enduring demand for the peers. Yet by the day's end, Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) had risen 1.45%, LinkedIn (LNKD) rose an irrelevant 0.57%, Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) fell 1.59%, and Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI) dropped a whopping 5.4%.The anticipation of social IPO's continues to reign high in light of the raging popularity built into the frameworks of the companies' business models themselves. The democratization of the internet, and more specifically online internet trading, has opened the markets to the average Joe who can now participate with ease as a willing shareholder in the companies most familiar to him. Lowered barriers of entry in regards to cost, news dissemination, and accessibility have all had a significant role in the impact social media's public financing success.It's no wonder that on their first trading days, social IPOs brought about a storm of bullishness. Social review peer Angie's List closed a respectable 25% higher than its pricing. Groupon closed 31% higher than its pricing. Zillow (NASDAQ:Z) had closed a whopping 79% above its pricing. Most shockingly of all, LinkedIn had closed 109% higher than its pricing with the start of the IPO craze. It had appeared as if the underwriters had lost all means of properly evaluating an appropriate worth for the company's they sponsored. Market pricing uncertainty had become a loose cannon that has echoed across the social sector as a whole.When we come back to the fundamentals, it's clear that social media companies fail to impress apart from the perceived growth that lies in store. In its own S-1 Filing, Yelp showed its meager hand that has been seemingly ignored by the investing public. By September 2011, the company's nine months results for 2011 amounted to a meager $58.4 million in revenues amounting to a loss from operations of $7.4 million. This amount in loss of operations had only come down from an $8.5 million loss over the same amount of time in the prior year. Altogether, prior to its IPO, Yelp had $42.1 million in total assets as of September 2011, with $23.3 million of that amount sitting in cash and restricted cash. Coupled with the ongoing losses to be expected, the $96 million or so that Yelp raised after expenses on Friday looks to be well-received relief for sore eyes.Nevertheless, Yelp now stands valued on the market around $1.3 billion. For the masses, I'm sure many would even consider the cost of this stock as cheap. After all, it only trades at a mere $24 and change right? For the democratized investing public, who can often seem unwilling to consider the concept of market capitalization, Yelp reigns as yet another success worthy of investment. And this is where things begin to just get scary for the sector as a whole. Departing from the fundamentals and investing on the basis of hype, the social media sector's rapid rise and ongoing popularity offers eerie echoes of a bubbly time set but a little over a decade prior. It's for this reason that I'm avoiding social media IPOs until things cool down and rational minds turn back into rational investors.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
399821,24145,2012-02-29T02:53:01-05:00,,"Based in San Francisco, Yelp! (NYSE:YELP) scheduled a $93 million IPO with a market capitalization of $780 million, at a price range mid-point of $13 for Friday, March 2, 2012.YELP is one of six IPOs scheduled for this week (see our IPO calendar).SUMMARYSeveral months ago there was talk of YELP IPO'ing at a market capitalization of one to two billion, which we said was high. The current price range mid-point valuation of $780 million is much lower.We believe YELP will 'pop' on the IPO because it has 66 million active users, and we expect some of them to be 'overly enthusiastic' in YELP IPO after-market.However, it appears that YELP is priced within the valuation range of companies such as Angie's List (NASDAQ:ANGI), Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and Jive (NASDAQ:JIVE) and doesn't deserve much of a premium. Also see 'red flags' below.CONCLUSION YELP is worth a speculation if your broker will let you sell in the first week. It's a small IPO and may have enough demand from its 66 million users to maintain a high stock price (relative to underlying fundamentals) initially.If the red flags identified below become real issues over time then YELP may not be worth the longer term risk.POTENTIAL RED FLAGSRelies on potential competitors for traffic ""Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in particular is the most significant source of traffic to our website accounting for more than half of the visits to our website from Internet searches during the year ended December 31, 2011.""""Google has removed links to our website from portions of its web search product, and has promoted its own competing products, including Google's local products"" S-1-, page 7Rate of revenue increase declines Revenue increase over the prior dropped from 19% in the June, 2011 quarter to 14% for the September quarter to 12% for the December quarter - not good going into an IPO.Rate of increase in unique visitors declines Unique visitors increased 18% in the September quarter over the June quarter but increased only 8% comparing the December quarter with the September quarter - not good going into an IPO.Sales & Marketing costs decline (perhaps to reduce loss rate) While sales and marketing costs as a percent of revenue dropped to 64% (still very high) in the December quarter from 67% in the September quarter - perhaps this was done purposely to help reduce the loss.No explanation for a $6 million charge in the December quarter ""Contribution to The Yelp Foundation.

The lack of further explanation is bothersome.Dual stock classes Class B common (insider) stock will represent 98.7% of voting power post-IPO. That's over-the-top, unnecessary and raises the question ""what do they know that we don't know?""BUSINESS Yelp connects people with great local businesses. YELP users have contributed a total of 25 million reviews of almost every type of local business, from restaurants, boutiques and salons to dentists, mechanics, plumbers and more.These reviews are written by people using Yelp to share their everyday local business experiences, giving voice to consumers and bringing ""word of mouth"" online. The information these reviews provide is valuable for consumers and businesses alike.66 million unique visitors used YELP website, and YELP's mobile application was used on 5.7 million unique mobile devices, on a monthly average basis during the quarter ended December 31, 2011.YELP's business revolves around three key constituencies: the contributors who write reviews, the consumers who read them and the local businesses that they describe.MARKETSAs of December 31, 2011, YELP was active in 46 Yelp markets in the United States and 25 Yelp markets internationally. This footprint represents a fraction of the potential domestic and international markets that we are currently targeting for expansion.Domestic expansion plans include growth in existing markets as well as expansion into new markets, many of which are smaller than current markets, as YELP looks to expand its breadth of coverage.Internationally, YELP is in the early stages of establishing its footprint. YELP is targeting a mix of both large and small markets. penetration, proximity to existing markets, number of local businesses and local ad market growth rate.COMPETITION YELP competitors include, among others; offline media companies and service providers; newspaper, television, and other media companies, Internet search engines, such as Google, Yahoo (YHOO) and Bing; and various other online service providers.In particular, major Internet companies, such as Google, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Yahoo! and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) may be more successful than YELP in developing and marketing online advertising offerings directly to local businesses, and many of YELP's advertisers and potential advertisers may choose to purchase online advertising services from these competitors and may reduce their purchases of YELP's productsUSE OF PROCEEDS YELP expects to net $82 million from its IPO, to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Additional disclosure: YELP is expected to price Thursday evening for trading Friday.

377211,22300,2012-02-19T08:12:56-05:00,,"Yelp (NYSE:YELP) is getting ready for its IPO. Pricing should start on March 1, with the company issuing 7.15 million shares somewhere between $12- $14 per share. So, the company is looking to raise around $100 million at a valuation of $778 million.There's only one word to describe this: overvalued. What bankers and Internet entrepreneurs do not realize is that the Internet is primarily a cost-savings mechanism. Yes, it is disruptive, but it's about pushing prices down -- A LOT. This means that all the numbers are supposed to be getting smaller: revenue, costs, employees, valuation. The only exception is numbers that measure profitability, like return on employee or profit margins.In the case of Yelp, it's probably easiest to see how this company is so overvalued when one looks at its revenue model. Internet marketer Raymond Fong has a scathing -- and, unfortunately for Yelp, accurate -- analysis of Yelp's advertising model in his post entitled, ""Is Yelp Ripping People Off?"" The short story is that Yelp is trying to charge upwards of $100 per thousand impressions. In another scathing review, columnist Rocky Agarwal cites $600 per thousand impressions as a number some local advertisers are paying.If you're familiar with Internet advertising models, you know this is ludicrous. It's like trying to charge $1,000 for a sandwich (or, for my fellow hyperinflationistas, half an ounce of gold). The king of all things advertising, Google, is charging much, much less. Like try 99% less.Josh Constine comes to Yelp's defense, arguing the ads are worth it because they are so targeted and thus can convert better. This may possibly be true, but there are two simple problems:But that's not all! It gets worse. In addition to unsustainably high prices is the fact that Yelp, which reported a net loss of $16.7 million in 2011 (bigger than 2010's net loss of $9.6 million, showing the company is headed in the wrong direction on the income statement), is that the IPO valuation is being priced at 9.3X last year's sales. Google trades at 5.2X sales, and Yahoo trades at 3.8X sales. So basically, Yelp trades at an excessively high multiple of unsustainable revenues.Now, Yelp does have some redeemable assets, and if the company were to use them properly -- something I find extremely unlikely -- it is possible this IPO could become something other than an embarrassment. Yelp's main asset is its active member base, user-generated content, and its phenomenal rankings in search engines. Because of these assets, Yelp is actually uniquely positioned to launch its own search engine and create even more user-generated content that could form the basis of a new media empire. If this avenue were successfully explored, Yelp could conceivably displace Google as the king of search. For those who, like I, believe that the next major search engine will have its roots as a social media powerhouse -- that social disrupts search -- Yelp has some major potential in this regard. But to effective pursue this angle, Yelp needs a new monetization model, as well as a focus on more than generating more quality content besides just local reviews.Ultimately, Yelp is another sham of an IPO that does little more than create a speculative frenzy and sully the reputation of Internet companies, the stock market in general, and the bankers like Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) that make this IPO possible. Like the rest of the stocks in Bubble 2.0, I think Yelp is only of interest to daytraders at its current proposed price and valuation.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The private purchases was part of another $36.8 million Elevation paid individual shareholders, including Stoppelman and Levchin.It is increasingly common for growth investors like Elevation or DST to provide founders and early shareholders with some liquidity before an IPO. Now that Yelp has filed to go public, these details are coming out in its S-1. Stoppelman and Levchin are still the two largest individual shareholders in Yelp. Stoppelman owns 11.1 percent of the company, while Levchin actually owns a little bit more, with 13.8 percent. Depending on what Yelp’s valuation will be at its IPO, those stakes could be worth more than $100 million each (assuming a $1 billion market cap).At the time of the Elevation transaction, Stoppelman sold 7.4 million shares, which would have been nearly a quarter of his shares at the time, based on the information available in the S-1. Meanwhile, Elevation became Yelp’s second largest shareholder, with almost the same number of shares as Bessemer (22.4 perecent versus 22.5 percent).

342411,22762,2012-02-06T03:26:09-05:00,,"By Rip EmpsonIt may now be obscured by all the hoopla surrounding Facebook’s (NASDAQ:FB) going public, but back in November the popular user-generated review site, Yelp (NYSE:YELP), filed to go public and planned to raise $100 million ahead of its IPO (at an expected $1 to $2 billion valuation). On Friday, Yelp filed an amended S-1 that shows that the company plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “YELP.”But, of perhaps greater interest to those following Yelp’s trajectory is the fact that the third amendment to the company’s S-1 includes full-year financials for 2011, showing that, while the company’s net revenues have continued to rise since 2009, its operating losses have continued to increase right along with them. Yelp’s total revenues in 2011 were $83.2 million, up 74.6 percent from $47.7 million in 2010 (and 25.8 million in 2009), but net losses were up to $16.9 million in 2011 — a 74.2 percent increase from a net loss of $9.5 million in 2010. (Adjusted EBITDA losses were $1.1 million.)The amended S-1 also shows some adjustments in Yelp’s traffic for 2011, as it saw 65.7 million unique monthly visitors for the year (with 5.7 million uniques on mobile), up from 39.3 million in 2010. Yelp users left 24.8 million reviews in 2011, up from 15.1 million in 2010.As to Yelp’s increasing net losses, most of that was incurred from sales, marketing, and product development-related expenses, as sales and marketing costs increased 61 percent to $54.5 million in 2011. Product development costs, in turn, rose 77 percent to $11.6 million, up from $6.5 million in 2010. Of course, revenues increased right along with losses, jumping to $83.2 million, with the majority of revenues coming from local advertising, which accounted for approximately 70 percent, or $58.4 million, of that total.Yelp was founded Jeremy Stoppelman, a former PayPal exec, in 2004, and follows the public debuts of both Groupon (NASDAQ:GRPN) and Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) late last year, along with the announced IPO of Facebook last week. Yelp may be operating in the red, but it’s not alone, joining the likes of Groupon and LivingSocial. It’s not unusual for fast-growing companies like these to operate at a loss early on their growth, spending big money on acquiring talent and competitors, or getting their message out through advertising.In terms of the latter company, Amazon’s updated filing with the SEC recently revealed that LivingSocial had sustained $558 million in losses in 2011, which mostly came from acquisitions, stock compensations, and marketing costs. While this was an expected part of LivingSocial’s fast-paced growth cycle, the high number certainly caught many by surprise — and in comparison — Yelp’s losses look slightly more manageable.As for Yelp, Goldman Sachs is leading the IPO, with Citigroup and Jefferies pitching in on management of the deal.Original post"

According to Money magazine, the company has over 22 million reviews of local businesses and raked in around $59 million in net sales during the first 9 months on 2011, compared with $47 million in revenue during 2010, $26 million in 2009, and $12 million in 2008.According to its prospectus the company has drawn around 61 million unique visitors to the site ""on a monthly average basis for the quarter ended September 30, 2011."" The company is not yet profitable, but is much closer to the black than many other internet companies, which have made their public debuts this year. Yelp lost only $7.6 million through September. By comparison, Groupon and Angie's List lost $633 million and $43 million respectively during the same period. Yelp lost $8.6 million last year.What is interesting about these numbers (besides the obvious fact that Yelp is a lot more responsible when it comes to spending than some other internet companies), is that the company is showing steady revenue growth and gradually shrinking losses. While not as spectacular as the growth of Groupon's sales (or red ink), the Wall Street Journal notes company's ""approach to growth is far more measured"" and consistent: revenue grew ""about 80% each quarter this year."" The company does note in the prospectus that its ""recent growth rate is likely not sustainable"" but even if ""sales growth slows to 60% next year, the roughly $1.5 billion valuation Yelp is...seeking would be around 11 times next year's revenue...[very] reasonable in the context of Yelp's possible strategic value to a larger company such as Microsoft."" One potential problem however, is that nearly 50% of traffic to Yelp's site comes from internet searches on Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), which tried to buy Yelp for $500 million in 2009 and was rebuffed. Now, according to Yelp's prospectus, Google is ""removing links to [Yelp] from portions of its web search product, and has promoted its own competing products...[which] could have a substantial negative effect on"" operating results going forward. Given the value consumers place on reviews found on Yelp the hope is certainly that Yelp's brand will become recognizable enough in its own right to reduce its reliability on Google in the future. Already, Yelp is the go-to site for consumers who want to rate local business--as Forbes notes, it remains to be seen whether the company can find a way to expand the products and services it offers in a meaningful and profitable way.Perhaps more disturbing is the fact that Yelp is not yet cashflow positive, unlike Groupon, which has generated cash for the past two years. However, the company is far closer to the black than it was last year in terms of cash flow, generating a negative $296,000 this year as opposed to negative $6.4 million in 2010, according to Fortune.Overall, Yelp's long-term prospects look better than those of Groupon and other internet IPOs that are hemorrhaging money at a spectacular rate. Additionally, the company is seeking to raise less money in its IPO than Groupon, Angie's List, LinkedIn, and Zynga making it about as much of a 'bargain' as any nonprofitable company can be. If the company can continue to shrink its losses in the face of rising costs it could be profitable sooner rather than later--but that is a big if. Nonetheless the fact that the company has already received a large buyout offer in the past indicates its value to larger companies. Combine this with its disciplined approach to growth and it seems like a better bet than most of the other internet companies that have gone public this year. The company should go public in the first quarter of 2012.     Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

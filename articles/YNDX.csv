Find out how you can get the best content on Seeking Alpha here.We believe that at the current price Yandex (YNDX) is overvalued. Since the beginning of the year, the company’s revenues started to decline sequentially and the business stopped growing. Considering this, it’s hard to justify purchasing Yandex’s shares at the current levels despite the fact that the company will continue to be one of the biggest tech conglomerates in Russia in years to come. By trading at P/E of over 80x, Yandex trades way above its peers and for that reason, we decided to open a small short position in the company and expect Yandex’s shares to decline in the foreseeable future.Yandex continues to be the biggest search engine in Russia with a 59.6% market share at the end of June, which is an increase from 56.9% in Q1. By leveraging its dominant position in the search market, the company is able to expand its ecosystem of products and services and establish a strong foothold in other industries. While online advertising business currently accounts for 49% of its overall revenues, the company’s taxi segment, which includes car-sharing and food delivery services, has been aggressively growing in recent years and at the end of Q2 accounted for 30% of the overall revenues.At the same time, Yandex has been actively expanding its eCommerce projects in the Russian market and a month ago, Yandex became a full owner of ""Yandex.Market"" after it paid $590 million to Sberbank (OTCPK:SBRCY) for its share in the joint venture. Since the reorganization of the joint venture is already complete, Yandex’s major goal in the upcoming quarters would be to make ""Yandex.Market"" profitable and fully integrate it into its own ecosystem of products and services.After the pandemic started, Yandex’s business struggled to remain its previous growth rates. In Q2, the company’s revenues were down 9.8% Y/Y to $591.9 million, while its net loss for the period was $52.3 million, down 203% Y/Y. Yandex’s profit margin for the period was -8.8% and the company was forced to spend $5.47 million in COVID-19 related expenses from April to June.Source: YandexWhile the taxi segment was able to increase its revenues by 42% Y/Y, the growth came mostly from the increased demand for food-delivery services, as the number of taxi rides declined by 6% Y/Y in Q2. At the same time, the segment’s COGS increased by 116% Y/Y, while its adjusted EBITDA declined from ~$15.40 million (423 million rubles) a year ago to ~$9.21 million (253 million rubles) in Q2. Overall, Yandex had a bad first half of the year and it will take time for its business to return to its pre-COVID-19 profitability levels.One of the biggest risks of Yandex is its exposure to the Russian economy and its political establishment. Last year, the company was forced to reorganize its governing body to please Kremlin officials and give the Russian state more power on M&A and data protection matters. At the same time, as Russia struggles to deal with the pandemic, its currency already depreciated by nearly 20% to the United States dollar in the first half of the year and its annual GDP is expected to be down more than 5% Y/Y. Since Yandex generates the majority of its revenue in rubles, a weak Russian currency along with the ongoing economic crisis will hurt the company’s bottom line in the next few quarters at the very least.Another problem that Yandex is facing is the decline of its business. The company’s revenues have been declining in the last couple of quarters, while its expenses were increasing. In addition, Yandex's taxi business is not going to offset the losses from the advertising market. As Sberbank and Mail Group are on the verge of establishing a stronger presence in the food-delivery industry, Yandex’s food business might also struggle to grow in a post-pandemic world. At the same time, as the Chinese ride-hailing app DiDi is about to enter the Russian market later this month, Yandex will be forced to spend more resources to maintain its leadership position, which will also hurt its earnings in the long-term.The reality is that as long as the advertising and taxi segments combined will account for the absolute majority of the company’s revenues, its other businesses from the media, music streaming, cloud, and other fields are not going to have a major impact on its overall financials. For that reason, it’s hard to justify purchasing Yandex’s shares at the current price. With a forward P/E and EV/EBITDA ratios of 83.32x and 33.8x, respectively, Yandex shares trade above the industry’s median and, in our opinion, the company is overvalued, considering that in Q3 and Q4, its earnings are also expected to be down Y/Y.Source: Capital IQOne of the main reasons why Yandex trades so high is due to the recent announcement that its stock will replace the stock of Russian mining company Nornickel on the Russian MSCI Index. On September 1, the rebalancing of the index will happen and Yandex’s weight in the index will increase to 9.44%, while Nornickel’s weight will decline to 4.72%. It’s likely that after the rebalancing occurs, Yandex’s shares will slowly start to fade. For that reason and due to the fact that the management didn’t provide any guidance for the year, we decided to open a small short position in the company and plan to hold it for the next couple of months.On September 11, Bears of Wall Street will l aunch a new Marketplace service: Best Short Ideas.The goal of the service is to provide you with actionable short ideas from which you can profit by betting against the companies that trade at irrational exuberance levels and have limited upside.

Its core product is a search engine that is one of the four most popular search engines in the world by requests. Yandex also offers taxi, food delivery, media, carsharing services, etc. Yandex accounts for 58.1% of the Russian online search market.Russian President Vladimir Putin made a statement on June 23, suggesting the introduction of tax concessions for Russian IT companies. The government is looking to reduce social insurance payments of accredited Russian IT companies that generate more than 90% of their income from the computer or database-related business etc. from 14% to 7.6%. The income tax of such companies may decline from 20% to 3%. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Digital Development would like to scrap a VAT tax concession that covers software sales stipulated by Article 149.2.26 of Russia's tax code to compensate for lower budget revenues. In addition, the project implies subsidies for IT companies, whose products are included in the register of Russian-made software.The project is aimed at improving the Russian business climate for IT companies and supposedly stopping the outflow of IT entrepreneurs from the country. However, the government may cancel the 'zero' VAT rate to keep budget revenues intact, and this will hit financial entities (the main software consumers) hard and slow down the introduction of IT technologies in other industries due to considerably higher prices.Following a meeting of officials and business representatives (Yandex, Mail, Telegram, etc.) in Kazan on July 9-10, Russia's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said that IT companies will be able to continue to benefit from the zero VAT rate during software sales, if this software is included in the Russian software register. This could mean the government is set to hold discussions with the business.Yandex earnings structure:Sources: company dataMail (OTC:MLRUY) main business segments:Earnings segments:Sources: company dataYandex and Mail cannot be currently included in the list of companies that could benefit from lower social insurance payments and income tax. However, if the companies create a stand-alone company that will be in charge of their software development business, they will take advantage of the maneuver. On the other hand, companies that generate more than 90% of income from software used to benefit from lower social insurance payments (14% instead of 30%), but Yandex and Mail did not carry out any optimization to cut the rate.Yandex announced the reorganization of the joint venture with Sberbank (OTCPK:SBRCY) on June 23. As a result, Yandex purchased Sberbank's stake in Yandex.Market and sold its stake in Yandex.Money. The companies used to have a disagreement over the ecosystem development. Also, such contradictory transactions as Sberbank's purchase of a stake in a joint venture with Mail Group (Yandex's rival in certain areas) cast a shadow on the business relations. There is no more disagreement due to the split, and the company will continue to develop its ecosystem with no obstacles.Yandex.Market reorganization planSource: company dataYandex announced an additional share issue in the amount of 5% of its equity. The company said it was planning to raise USD 800 mln. According to the announcement, VTB was expected to buy one-fourth of the amount, two-fourths were to be purchased by investment companies owned by Roman Abramovich, Alexander Abramov, and Alexander Frolov. The remaining shares were offered to the public. That said, more shares had been sold by the moment the transaction was over on June 29. The company attracted USD 1.06 bln as demand for its stock was high. An additional share issue tends to lead to capital dilution and a fall in share price, but in this case, it drove up the company's value. These positive developments may have resulted from the fact that Yandex said it would spend the attracted funds to finance further development of Yandex.Market or, perhaps, the purchase of Uber's (NYSE:UBER) stake in Yandex.Taxi.Yandex's additional share issueSource: company dataYandex has recently registered a number of trademarks related to finance and insurance: YaExchange (YaBIrzha), YaBroker, YaCapital, YaInsurance (YaStrakhovka), YaAccount (YaSchyot), etc. This may signal the company may be willing to explore the segment of investment and finance, the only sector that its ecosystem lacks.Yandex used to own a stake in Yandex.Money payment service, but Sberbank got hold of it after the breakup of their partnership. That said, earlier, Yandex added the function of finance management to its Yandex.Plus service that functions on the basis of VTB's platform. This means the companies have established partnerships, while the fact that VTB has purchased Yandex stock may be the final confirmation of these relations that open up a new development course for both the companies.The number of taxi orders declined 50-80% in major cities during the coronavirus pandemics and quarantine, meanwhile, Yandex.Taxi's earnings went up compared to 1Q20. The company has managed to build a strong food delivery service that is also part of Yandex.Taxi.The number of individuals trading on Moscow ExchangeSource: Moscow Exchange dataMoscow Exchange saw a considerable increase in the number of accounts opened by individuals - up by almost 50%, from 6 mln to 9 mln. This was triggered by higher market volatility, active advertisement of brokerage services, self-isolation during the coronavirus quarantine, and a recent reduction of bank deposit rates. Yandex is a well-known brand, and many people use its services. It is probably for this reason that its stock enjoys demand from individuals, especially novice investors, and this boosts the company's value.There were no obvious signals that could push Yandex stock up, but the company has become associated with positive trends, which caused an increase in its market capitalization. Russia's IT tax maneuver will not impact major players, such as Yandex or Mail, directly as they have a large share of advertisement income in their earnings, but this maneuver signals the Russian IT sector will develop, while its attractiveness will rise. Companies will be able to partly benefit from lower income tax and social insurance payments through restructuring. The end of the partnership with Sberbank and cooperation with VTB will allow Yandex to continue to develop its ecosystem without the need to settle the disagreement, as before. In addition, as more individuals open brokerage accounts and buy Yandex stock, its market capitalization will increase. That said, the company is currently considerably overvalued, with its P/E totaling 62.9 and EV/EBITDA totaling 27.2, twice as much as these indicators of similar companies. Even if the company's EBITDA supposedly grows 45% due to the service development in 2020, the fundamental price of its stock is RUB 3,450, or USD 48.5."
4347980,101963,2020-05-15T11:50:27-04:00,"Yandex has enough resources to withstand the current crisis and create value in the months to come.In Q1, the company reported record earnings, as its revenue increased by 26% Y/Y, while net income was up 76% Y/Y.I’m long Yandex.","In the last decade, Yandex (YNDX) has greatly diversified its portfolio of projects and became one of the biggest Russian tech companies with interests in businesses like food delivery and car-sharing. At the same time, search and digital advertising businesses continue to be the biggest drivers of growth accounting for the majority of the company’s revenues. While Russia becomes the country with one of the highest COVID-19 cases in the globe, Yandex can minimize its downside and survive the pandemic with relative ease.While its P/E ratio of 55x might scare lots of investors in the current market environment, I strongly believe that Yandex has not reached its full potential yet and has more room for growth. It has been showing a top-notch performance in the last few years and it managed to build a strong balance sheet, which will help it to stay afloat for a long period. Thanks to its nearly monopolistic position in the Russian tech industry, Yandex has all the ability to create shareholder value in the long-term. For that reason, I continue to be bullish on the company and hold a long position in it.After beating Google (GOOG)( GOOGL) and becoming Russia’s most popular search engine, Yandex quickly started to diversify itself and acquire shares in non-core businesses. While search and digital businesses accounted for 64% of its overall revenues in Q1, the company’s taxi business continues to quickly gain traction and positively affect the overall financials of Yandex. As COVID-19 ravages Russia, strict lockdown measures are implemented and users start to flock to the internet in record numbers. All of this helps Yandex to establish a stronger presence inside Russia, acquire additional users to its ecosystem at a lower cost, and offer them different products and services.At the end of April, Yandex reported its Q1 results, which were in-line with its estimates. The revenue for the three months increased by 26% year-over-year to $604.7 million, while net income of $70.7 million was also up 76% year-over-year. With P/E of 55.35x, Yandex trades above nearly all of its peers, as the industry’s median P/E ratio is only 30.18x. However, Yandex is far from being overvalued. Unlike its peers, Yandex is much smaller in size, which makes it easier for it to drive growth in comparison to its more established global competitors. By having countless competitive advantages in Russia, its stock has more room for growth, as it doesn’t have any real competitors on its home turf.Source: Yahoo Finance. The table was created by the authorIn its recent report, Yandex said that search queries from January to March increased by 7% Y/Y, but at the same time the average cost per click decreased by 9% on an annual basis. Nevertheless, the decline was offset by the higher number of paid clicks, which increased by 23% in Q1. This is because the higher than usual online traffic decreased the average CPM, while at the same time increased the click rate at a cheaper price.Source: YandexThe good news is that Yandex will continue to be the major digital advertising network for businesses all around Russia thanks to its popularity. As a result, Yandex will be able to continue to make profits from ads and reinvest them back into the business.In addition to search and advertisement, Yandex has been heavily betting on the taxi business inside Russia. Last year it acquired the country’s popular taxi service Vezet and became the biggest taxi operator in Russia with 39% of market share. In Q1, Yandex Taxi gained traction and despite the pandemic, made $153 million in revenue. Besides Taxi, Yandex also became an active participant in the car-sharing business back in 2017. Two years later, Yandex Drive was named a largest car-sharing company in the world with a fleet of over 21000 cars. Yandex has been investing in both of those businesses for a reason.Earlier last year, Sberbank predicted the urban transportation business to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 15% in the next few years and worth around $27 billion in 2025. By being a dominant player in the taxi and car-sharing businesses, Yandex can greatly benefit from this growing market. That’s one of the main reasons why I think the stock has enough upside even at the current price. There’s already a possibility that the Taxi business will become a standalone company in the future and reports of a possible IPO are already being flown over. By executing a spin-off and selling the shares of a taxi business to the public, Yandex will be able to unlock $5 billion to $8 billion worth of value to its existing shareholders.While the pandemic will most likely push the IPO date further, Yandex shareholders shouldn’t be disappointed. As other companies look for government handouts and declare bankruptcies, Yandex was able to hoard enough cash to get through this pandemic alive and well. It has one of the strongest balance sheets among its peers. At the end of March, it had $2.5 billion in cash, most of which is in the United States dollars. Most of its debt of $1.26 billion matures only in 2025, so the company has enough time and resources so that it doesn’t need to worry about its obligations.The biggest downside of Yandex is its close ties to the Kremlin. In November, the company changed its corporate governance structure and announced targeted amendments to comply with Russia’s new regulatory environment. The amendments change the company’ s structure and create a public interest foundation, which now can block more than a 10% sale of the company’s stock to other entities and individuals. This helps Kremlin to prevent the purchase of a large chunk of Yandex shares by foreign entities.The good news is that Yandex is not exposed to other markets, so the creation of the foundation will not have any real impact on its operations or the ordinary shareholders. While Yandex is too small to compete against its global peers on a worldwide stage, it doesn’t need to do so to create value. It has enough competitive advantages in Russia to drive growth. By being a near-monopoly in the digital space and having warm relations with the Kremlin, the threat of new entrants is very low. So while its stock is exposed to political risks, the company’s potential to create value in the current environment with its current assets is high. That’s why I believe that a high P/E ratio of 55x shouldn’t scare investors. I’m long Yandex."
4364138,103815,2020-08-04T10:19:29-04:00,"Yandex is Russia's premier high-tech company with annual revenues of roughly $2.8 billion from a variety of online or online-enabled businesses.The company has been hit hard by COVID-19; revenue growth has stalled and adjusted EBITDA is declining.Shareholders are exposed to potential and current dilution from convertible bond and stock offerings.Capital allocation is a question mark; $590 million of the capital raised apparently went to buy back 45% of money-losing Yandex.Market.At $57 - $58 per share, it's time to sell and wait for a cheaper re-entry point.","Yandex (NASDAQ: YNDX) is Russia's premier high-tech company with annual revenues of roughly $2.8 billion from a variety of online or online-enabled businesses including internet search, taxi and ride-hailing, food delivery, classifieds, e-commerce and online media services.Source: archello.comIn my March 8, 2020 article about YNDX, I concluded:A lot has changed since that time and for this investor, it was time to sell. Now, I'll explain why.Over the past few months the world has simply become a riskier place. COVID-19 has proved a stubborn virus with deaths worldwide climbing toward 700,000 (about 14,000 in Russia). The impact of quarantines, new disease protocols and other efforts to slow the spread of the virus have sent unemployment skyrocketing while national GDP's plummeted to recession levels. Increases in the money supplies of many countries have raised serious questions about sovereign debt and political unrest has sent crowds to the streets - even Russia.SOURCE: worldpoliticsreview.comStock markets everywhere have experienced increased volatility while companies have seen revenue evaporate. For investors in YNDX, the scales may have tipped in favor of risk management over ""fear of missing out.""There are several reasons to own YNDX. The company is 1) the biggest, safest high-tech play on the Russian and CIS markets, 2) providing diversification for non-Russian investors, 3) with acknowledged technological leadership in businesses with long-term potential, and 4) until recently, stellar revenue growth. In fact, revenue growth has disappeared. The following is a slide from the 2Q 2020 Investor Presentation.Source: YNDX 2Q 2020 Investor PresentationIf we follow the very last column on the right, which presents quarterly year-over-year revenue growth, we can see a zero for revenue growth from 2Q 2019 to 2Q 2020. Revenue for the company's premier ""pure digital"" Search and Portal segment, accounting for 61.5% of 2Q 2020 total revenue, was down 12% compared to 1Q 2019 and 15.5% compared to 1Q 2020. Granted, internet ad revenues have been hit hard. Google's parent company Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL), for example, suffered a 2% revenue decrease year-over-year 2Q 2019 / 2Q 2020, but YNDX is not Google.The 2Q 2020 bright spot was the relatively low-tech Taxi segment comprised of taxi and ride-hailing services and food delivery. Revenue for this segment was up 42% year-over-year and accounted for 30.2% of 2Q 2020 total revenue. Low-tech is growing in importance at YNDX.Like any stock, owning YNDX has always involved a number of trade-offs. With a dominant local market position accompanied by rapid growth investors could rationalize the Russian political risk, but with revenue growth stalled in the face of COVID-19, is ownership worth the risk? Will the stock price follow?Adjusted EBITDA performed a disappearing act as well, dropping RUB 4.6 billion or 35.2% from RUB 13.1 billion in 2Q 2019 to RUB 8.5 billion in 2Q 2020. As the following slide from the YNDX 2Q 2020 Investor Presentation illustrates, the decline in ""profitability"" was worryingly general; every segment reported lower adjusted EBITDA compared to the prior year quarter.Source: YNDX 2Q 2020 Investor PresentationAs the second half of the slide on the right shows, almost every segment suffered declining margins as well. The entire corporate world is experiencing declining margins due to the impact of COVID-19, but declining profitability in a ""risky"" stock has to be a consideration.Yandex.Market is beginning to look like a corporate soccer ball being kicked everywhere but toward the goal. It was only two years ago that YNDX announced a joint venture with Sberbank (OTCPK: OTCPK:SBRCY) to create two strong e-commerce competitors; Beru and Bringly. SBRCY paid YNDX $500 million for 45% of the joint venture - the largest amount of capital ever injected into Russian e-commerce - and YNDX contributed Yandex.Market. The two agreed to work jointly on payments service provider Yandex.Money. Bringly, an in-bound cross-border marketplace, died an early corporate death. Beru survived and improved, but has not challenged the market leaders. In July 2019 the partners were reported to be squabbling, so it came as no surprise that the end of the joint venture was announced on June 23, 2020. Only two years after announcing the benefits of the joint venture, YNDX executives backpedaled furiously, announcing the benefits of the end of the joint venture. Here's YNDX Deputy CEO Tigran Khudaverdyan as quoted in the Moscow Times:To unwind the joint venture, Sberbank will sell its 45% stake in Yandex.Market back to YNDX for roughly $590 million and YNDX will sell its 25% stake in Yandex.Money to Sberbank for about $34 million. The transaction is expected to close on 3Q 2020.When the transaction closes, Yandex.Market, which has been accounted for using the equity method for two years where its results were virtually impossible to decipher, will again be ""above the line.""According to Greg Abovsky, Chief Operating and Chief Financial Officer, during the 2Q 2020 Conference Call, on a stand-alone basis Yandex.Market had 2Q 2020 revenues of RUB 7.8 billion or about $124.8 million and incurred a net loss of RUB 1.8 billion or about $28.8 million. Annualizing those numbers, in the second half of 2020 look for Yandex.Market to contribute roughly RUB 15.6 billion or about $249.6 million to revenues and reduce net income by roughly RUB 3.6 billion or about $57.6 million.The corporate divorce occurred while Sberbank was deepening its e-commerce and other ties to Mail.ru (OTC:MLRYY) and e-commerce player Ozon. According to the Moscow Times, Yandex.Market was a ""cash-eater, only expected to turn profitable by 2023"" and the bank's ""return on investment for the joint venture came in at 12.6%, below the market average for returns in e-commerce and Sberbank's own earnings level - more than 20% and 14%, respectively.""Taking the most uncharitable view of the two-year long series of transactions, YNDX investors essentially received a $500 million loan at 12.6% interest and are now 100% owners of a weak e-commerce player losing about $100 million a year.On February 25, 2020, YNDX announced the offering of $1.25 billion in 0.75% coupon convertible senior notes due 2025. The notes are convertible into Class A shares with an initial conversion price of $60.0751 per share to be satisfied subject to the company's discretion with cash or shares. Settlement and delivery took place on or about March 3. Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) was the lead underwriter. At the conversion price, approximately 20,807,289 Class A shares would be issued, potentially diluting the existing 291,898,179 Class A shares outstanding as of March 31, 2020 (per the prospectus for the share issuance discussed below) by roughly 7.1%.On June 29, 2020, the company went to the well again, closing on simultaneous public and private common stock offerings that raised a net total of approximately $1.0 billion. On the public side, YNDX sold 8,121,827 Class A shares and Goldman Sachs, the sole underwriter, exercised in full its option to purchase an additional 1,218,274 shares for a grand total of 9,340,101 shares at an offering price of $49.25 per share.On the private side, in a Reg S offering, YNDX sold 12,182,739 shares at $49.25 per share; 4,060,913 each to JSC VTB Capital, the investment arm of Russian bank VTB Group, Roman Abramovich's Ervington Investments Limited and Alexander Abramov's and Alexander Frolov's Treliscope Limited. Goldman Sachs International served as the sole placement agent.A total of 21,522,840 shares were issued, immediately diluting Class A shareholders by roughly 7.4%.Is there a logic to the potential dilution, which, after all, increases the Class A shares voting power? Prior to any dilution from these transactions, the 291,878,289 Class A shares (owned by ""ordinary"" shareholders) controlled about 45% of the voting power compared to the 35,714,674 Class B shares (with ten votes for each share, 48% owned by CEO Arkady Volozh) with about 55% of the voting power. After all the dilution, potential and actual, Class B shares will still control a little more than 51% of the voting power.The control issues are par for the course with a Russian company, but the capital raise is problematic. There is an extremely high probability that $590 million of the approximately $2.25 billion raised went to repurchasing 45% of Yandex.Market, a marginally competitive business losing over $100 million a year that Sberbank believed would not be profitable until at least 2023. Time will tell if this is a prudent allocation of capital. On the other hand, investors should also consider if the powerful Russian investors who bought in at $49.25 know something we don't.All calculated values for stocks are problematic, but they do play a part in our decision-making. I am not immune from the ""anchoring phenomena"" that calculating a theoretical stock value can produce. In my last article on YNDX I updated my sum-of-the-parts valuation and the result was a value estimate of $58.91 per share. About 74.9% of the value was generated by a DCF valuation of the Search and Portal segment which used an average annual 18% growth rate for the next five years - that seems too optimistic at this point. If I changed nothing else, but dropped in a 15% average annual growth rate for Search and Portal, the stock's estimated value falls to $54.19 per share.As I said in my opening paragraph, I decided to sell for the reasons I've enumerated above and one more. All things considered, I was satisfied with my gain.I expected YNDX to be worth about $60.00 per share within my typical 3 to 5-year holding period. I owned two equal tranches of YNDX, one purchased on November 11, 2019 at $34.19 per share, the other purchased on February 21, 2020 at $45.05 per share. I sold on July 29, 2020 at $57.67 per share for an annualized gain of about 80.2% on my investment. For this investor, that was good enough given COVID-19 and other uncertainties. J.P. Morgan said it more succinctly long ago.Source: britannica.comWhat about YNDX going forward? It has already exceeded my sale price with an intraday price of $58.87 per share on August 3, 2020. It may well continue to rally, but I always expect any company's real-world financial and operational performance to eventually drive its stock price. When, and if, I buy the stock again, it will be at a much lower entry point around $38.00 to $40.00 per share."
4362833,104669,2020-07-31T09:34:29-04:00,"Yandex published expectedly disappointing Q2 results.The stock price is out of tune with fundamentals.It's maybe too early to sell the stock, but definitely too late to buy.","These days, Yandex's (NASDAQ:YNDX) shares are trying to emulate the behavior of the US big tech stocks, which continue to soar no matter what. The problem, however, is that the rally went too far from the reality the company operates in today. The recent stock run would make sense for Yandex in pre-covid times, but now it's really hard to justify a ridiculously high valuation of the company.On the other hand, if we look at Yandex through the lenses of a typical growth story where the public appreciates not the numbers but some abstract bright perspectives of the company, then the rally can be at least partially justified. Specifically for Yandex, this narrative was supplemented by some new points I discuss in this article.Consolidated revenue remained at last year's level of 41.4 billion rubles ($591.9 million).Source: Company data, Author's spreadsheetAdjusted EBITDA decreased by 35% year on year to RUB 8.5 billion ($121.3 million). Adjusted EBITDA margin amounted to 20.5%.Source: Company data, Author's spreadsheetAdjusted net income amounted to RUB 1.9 billion ($27.3 million) and decreased by 67% compared to the second quarter of 2019.Source: Company data, Author's spreadsheetThe weak results of Yandex came in line with analysts' expectations, though the company's EBITDA turned out to be 6% higher. The decline in revenue growth was due to weak advertising business results, which were partially offset by growth in FoodTech and Media Services. The share of the revenue from non-advertising activities reached 40% for the first time. Although, I expect this number to decrease as ad revenues recover in Q3 and Q4 together with the Russian economy.For those who may be surprised why the company is trading so high amid the mediocre results, let me share my assumptions on why this happens:In the meantime, investors seemingly ignore the threat to Yandex.Taxi coming from China. The Chinese taxi service DiDi (DIDI) finally launched its Russian branch in the Republic of Tatarstan. Considering how hard DiDi competed with Uber (NYSE:UBER) in China, I think DiDi will act aggressively in the Russian market as well.Besides offering lower commissions to drivers compared to Yandex.Taxi, DiDi may gain a presence in Russia through acquisitions: the company is considering buying the Russian business of Dostavista, which is engaged in express delivery services in 10 countries. Ambitions of DiDi in the Russian market definitely won't bode well for Yandex, so it would be reasonable for Yandex to ask the Russian government for some protectionist measures. This, in my opinion, is totally fair because Chinese companies often have virtually unlimited funding from Chinese banks, which gives them a very strong advantage in conquering targeted markets.The second half of the year is set to be better in operational terms for Yandex, and this seems to be already priced in the stock. Investors should keep in mind that Yandex refrained from providing guidance for the rest of the year, mentioning economic uncertainty and poor predictability of a second wave of the pandemic as the main risk. If quarantine measures are not reintroduced, the company will show decent growth in H2 2020. As for the stock, it makes sense to wait for the rebalancing of the MSCI Russia index and sell the stock shortly after it gets inflows from the index funds."

Let’s see how the company looks now.Search: No.1 in RussiaIs it still accurate to refer to Yandex as the “Google of Russia?” Has the company maintained its position as No.1 in Russian search? In a word, yes. According to Yandex, its share of Russian search market, including mobile, averaged 57.5% in 4Q 2019, up from 56.5% in 4Q 2018 and 56.6% in 3Q 2019. The company’s mobile share on Android in Russia was 54.3% in 4Q 2019, up from 49.5% in 4Q 2018 and 52.8% in 3Q 2019. Throughout 2019 and through the first months of 2020, Yandex successfully battled Alphabet’s (NASDAQ: GOOG, GOOGL) Google to retain its No.1 ranking.Taxi: No.1 in RussiaIn a report released in October 2019, the Analytical Center for the Government of the Russian Federation identified Yandex.Taxi as No. 1 in the Russian taxi and ride-sharing market with a 27% share with Vezyot at 12%, Maksim at 9%, Gett at 5% and Citymobil at 1%. If YNDX is successful in its proposed acquisition of Vezyot, its No.1 position will be unassailable. Yandex.Taxi already dominates many major Russian markets. According to Statista, for example, the company accounted for 56.5% of all rides in Moscow in 2018.Classifieds: No. 2 in RussiaThe Classifieds segment includes verticals Auto.ru, Yandex.Realty and Yandex.Jobs, each mirroring larger internet businesses, for example, in the order above, Autotrader, Realtor.com and Indeed.com. While Avito, owned by South African internet conglomerate Naspers (OTCMKTS: OTCPK:NPSNY), is Russia’s largest internet classifieds business with estimated 2019 revenues of about RUB 24.0 billion, YNDX maintained the No.2 ranking with RUB 5.4 billion in combined revenues for 2019. Mail.ru’s (Other OTC: OTC:MLRYY) Youla is a distant third with an estimated RUB 2.0 billion in revenues for 2019.Media Services: A Strong Player in A Fragmented Regional MarketMedia Services is a rapidly growing segment with strong product offerings in a fragmented market. While both the video and music elements of Media Services technically have global reach, their real strength lies in Russia and former member or client states of the Soviet Union with Russian-speaking populations; Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Media Services revenues - including both video and audio offerings - were up almost RUB 2.0 billion or 103% to RUB 3.9 billion in 2019 from RUB 1.9 billion in 2018.YNDX is investing heavily in the video portion of its Media Services segment to create a vertically integrated internet entertainment company; producing content, streaming and distributing TV, videos and theatrical releases. The video verticals; KinoPoisk, Yandex.Afisha, Yandex.TV Program and Yandex.Studio, continue to be relevant as standalone businesses, but are increasingly being offered as a value-oriented bundle through smart portal Yandex.Live and subscription service Yandex.Plus.Within its territory of the primarily Russian-speaking audio market, music streaming service Yandex.Music is a strong competitor with an estimated 20 million users - paid and free. For comparison purposes, leading music streaming service Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) has over 124 million paid users. Although a small player on the world stage, this YNDX segment is growing rapidly with the number of paid subscribers increasing 55% from about 2 million 3Q 2019 to 3.1 million 4Q 2019.Other Bets & Experiments: No.1 in Russia and Worldwide in Car-Sharing The surprise within this high-tech incubator segment is not autonomous cars where Yandex was the fifth company to join the 1 million-mile self-driving club, but the lower-tech Yandex.Drive car-sharing service, which claims to have the largest car-sharing fleet in the world with 21,000 vehicles. The service allows users with a smart-phone app to unlock and rent cars situated throughout major Russian cities. According to RusAutoNews.com, YNDX has a 50% share of the car-sharing market in Russia.As we’ll see in the next section Yandex.Drive is driving a major portion of the revenue growth in Other Bets and Experiments.YNDX consolidated revenues increased RUB 47.7 billion or 37% from RUB 127.7 billion in 2018 RUB 175.4 billion, better than the previous year-over-year 36% increase from 2017 to 2018. In fact, revenues have been rising at an accelerating rate; the 5-Year CAGR in revenues from 2014 - 2018 was 25.9%, but increased to 30.9% for 2015 - 2019.The growth in income from operations moderated to RUB 3.8 billion or 18.5% from RUB 20.8 billion in 2018 to RUB 24.7 billion in 2019, down from the unsustainable 60% growth between 2017 and 2018, but that should have been expected. The 5-year CAGR for income from operations from 2015 to 2019 was a robust 26.7%.Examining the revenue growth of the Yandex business segments from 2018 to 2019 we see that the revenues of the largest division; Search and Portal, grew about 21% year over year, but everything else experienced explosive growth.SOURCE: YNDX Quarterly Supplemental Materials February 14, 2020Revenues in the Taxi segment, for example, increased RUB 18.8 billion or 98% from RUB 19.2 billion in 2018 to RUB 38.0 billion in 2019. While Yandex historically relied on organic growth, acquisitions have been important in the growth of the Taxi segment. In 2019, Yandex reaped the full benefits of its 2018 MLU B.V. joint venture, through which Yandex.Taxi effectively acquired the ride-hailing and food delivery businesses of Uber (NYSE: UBER) in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Russia. In July 2019, the MLU B.V. joint venture announced the purchase of the “IP and call-centers of the Vezet group of companies” for $71.5 million in cash. Vezet operates a ride-sharing business in 123 Russian cities under the Vezet, Taxi Saturn, Fasten and Red Taxi brands.As an investor, I continue to favor the rumored $5 - $8 billion IPO of the Taxi segment, a low-tech business trapped in a high-tech company. In fact, management may be readying the segment for an IPO as it turned “profitable” in 2019, reporting RUB 748.0 million in adjusted EBITDA vs negative RUB 4.4 billion in 2018. The opposing argument for YNDX retaining the Taxi segment, supported by management in the past, is that high-tech dispatch, control, fleet management and maintenance capabilities will eventually come in handy for the management of a fleet of autonomous vehicles.Of special interest is the huge RUB 9.5 billion or 168% growth in revenues for Other Bets and Experiments, the Yandex in-house business incubator segment. Management noted that Yandex.Drive was responsible for the bulk of the revenue growth. According to a January 13, 2020 Moscow Times article, Yandex.Drive will expand to a major European city through the roll-out of a 1,000-strong fleet of electric cars in 2020.SOURCE: ChicagoTribune.comYNDX sees car-sharing as a bridge to fully autonomous vehicles - which it is developing as well. In a February 12, 2019 Chicago Tribune article entitled “Why do automakers fear car-sharing? Take a look at Moscow,” Anton Ryazanov, head of Yandex.Drive, noted:The Financial Times commented on the bright future for this service in a January 12, 2020 article entitled “Yandex to offer car-sharing in Europe as rivals pull out:”Note that car-sharing is not currently part of the Taxi segment; a Taxi Segment IPO would not necessarily include car-sharing.The explosive growth in segments other than Search and Portal seems to be something most analysts have discounted. Take a look at the distribution of revenue in 2018 compared to 2019.NOTE: Intracompany eliminations related primarily to advertising revenues between segments have been included in each pie to allow revenues to equal total company revenues in each year. Revenues by segment after eliminations are not available on a comparable basis.The most striking observation from the data above is that Search and Portal is declining in importance; the segment contributed 69.5% of revenue in 2019 compared to 79.1% in 2018. The Taxi and Other Bets and Experiments segments - which we discussed above for their phenomenal growth - combined for 10.8% more of total revenue in 2019 than just one year before. The much smaller Classified and Media Services segments experienced strong growth, but from a much smaller base and combined to account for just under 1% more of total revenue in 2019 than the prior year. E-Commerce disappeared as the joint venture with Sberbank (OTCMKTS: OTCPK:SBRCY) is now accounted for using the equity method of accounting.YNDX is diversifying away from its traditional dependence on search-related revenues. Transportation in the form of traditional taxi services, ride-hailing and car-sharing (plus food delivery as it is included in these revenues), has become a much more important part the business. Although much smaller, Classified and Media Services should begin to have a similar impact in the years ahead.After 3Q 2019, it appeared that YNDX was cruising toward a great 2019. YTD 3Q 2019 income from operations, for example, was up RUB 6.4 billion or 48% over 2018. YTD net income was down RUB 28.6 billion or 70.6%, but that was easily explainable because of the RUB 28.2 billion 2018 impact of the Yandex.Market deconsolidation. Adjusting for that one-time event, it certainly looked like YNDX would eke out a small increase in net income year-over-year; a nice supplement to the strong reported income from operations.Instead, full-year 2019 income from operations increased just RUB 3.8 billion or 18.5% and net income fell RUB 33.2 billion or 72.1%. Obviously, we need to understand a very weak 4Q 2019. The YNDX of 2019 was not the YNDX of 2018 so the typical comparison to the previous year is not going to help us much here, so let’s compare 3Q 2019 to 4Q 2019:YNDX experienced heavy revenue and expense growth in 4Q 2019. The sequential quarter RUB 6.7 billion or 14.8% increase in revenue is a very lofty annualized 59.2% growth rate - and expenses grew even faster. There’s a lot of cautionary yellow highlights in the comparison above because on a sequential quarter basis total operating costs and expenses were up RUB 9.2 billion or 24.6% - an annualized 98.4% growth rate! The rather bland explanation for the huge cost increases was buried in the “Consolidated Operating Costs and Expenses” section of the 4Q 2019 Press Release: “Increases across all cost categories reflect investments in overall growth.” Clearly a lot of changes occurring at YNDX in 2019 were concentrated in 4Q 2019 including a 504-person or 5.3% increase in staff over 3Q 2019.Most of the increase in expenses occurred in two areas; cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative. Although YNDX does not provide complete GAAP financial information by segment on a quarterly basis we can make some interesting observations.Cost of revenues accounted for RUB 3.7 billion or 40.1% of the sequential RUB 9.2 billion increase in expenses. The table below breaks down the RUB 3.7 billion increase in cost of revenues per the detail provided by YNDX.Traffic acquisition costs (“TAC”), what YNDX pays to partners for participation in its ad network, product distribution or search queries referrals, increased 15.2% and accounted for 23.6% of the increase in cost of revenues. The relatively direct and offsetting relationship between ad revenues and TAC, however, mitigates the impact of this component of the increase in cost of revenues. YNDX appears to have TAC under control as this comparison with Alphabet indicates:In the bottom line highlighted in green, I removed the more “traditional” Taxi segment revenues in attempt to provide a better direct comparison with Alphabet as this segment has minimal impact on TAC. Calculated either way, YNDX appears to be efficient in its application of TAC.The Taxi segment arguably became more efficient over the sequential quarters as revenues increased RUB 2.2 billion or 23.2% from RUB 9.6 billion to RUB 11.8 while cost of revenues only increased RUB 873.0 million or 28.8% on a smaller base. It’s not surprising that this segment finally showed positive EBITDA in 2019 with RUB 271.0 million for 4Q 2019 and RUB 748.0 million for the full year.The “Other” component of cost of revenues includes early-stage business initiatives with low or no margins in the Classifieds, Media Services and Other Bets and Experiments segments. This component accounted for more than half of the increase in cost of revenues, increasing RUB 1.9 billion or 37.8% over the sequential quarters, but revenues for the “Other” component only increased RUB 1.3 billion or 32.6%. Examples of the costs incurred in these businesses include the cost of increasing the car fleet of Yandex.Drive and adding Media Services content. These cost increases will be more persistent than those in TAC and Taxi as they are essentially funding growth.Selling, general and administrative expenses (“SG&A”) accounted for RUB 3.8 billion or 42.0% of the sequential RUB 9.2 billion increase in expenses. A one-time expense associated with corporate restructuring accounted for RUB 882.0 million or 22.7% of the increase. In terms of run-rate increases, a surprisingly large amount of the sequential quarterly increase in SG&A, RUB 480.0 million or 12.4%, was stock-based compensation for employees. The remainder of the increase in SG&A, RUB 2.5 billion, consisted of higher advertising and marketing costs and an increase in headcount.Primarily as a result of these two categories of operating expense increasing faster than revenues, 4Q 2019 income from operations, another yellow highlight, was down RUB 2.5 billion or 34.2% to RUB 4.9 billion from the 3Q 2019’s RUB 7.4 billion. This was especially disconcerting to analysts as it broke the pattern of 2018 and 2019 through 3Q 2019 of the first quarter being the weakest, perhaps because of the Russian winter, with rising income from operations for each succeeding quarter.To make matters worse, other income was down RUB 1.8 billion or 646.8% from RUB 282.0 million 3Q 3 2019 to a loss of RUB 1.5 billion 4Q 2019. There were two main factors at work. Increased expenses associated with efforts to grow the Beru marketplace within the Yandex.Market joint venture with Sberbank (OTCPK: SBRCY) contributed to the 4Q 2019 net loss on equity method investments of RUB 1.4 billion compared to the 3Q 2019 net loss of RUB 899.0 million. Here’s the “splash page” of beru.ru in Russian. In small Cyrillic writing under the “6epy!” on the righthand top of the page it says “Marketplace from Sberbank and Yandex.” The selection of goods and quality of the website have both improved since I last reviewed it 3Q 2019.SOURCE: beru.ruThe other factor driving down other income, in the grab-bag other income/(loss), net category, was a 4Q 2019 RUB 999.0 million foreign exchange loss which resulted in a net loss of RUB 915.0 million compared to the positive RUB 364.0 million 3Q 2019 result.At this point, 4Q 2019 was toast; those little pointy pieces they put caviar on in Russia. Net income before taxes was down about RUB 4.4 billion or 56.6% - from the previous sequential quarter! An alert reader will notice the apparent effective tax rate of 91.6% for 4Q 2019. Income taxes were essentially unchanged from the much more profitable 3Q 2019 due to non-deductible expenses from stock-based compensation, equity-method investments and goodwill impairment. Adding insult to injury, after taxes and noncontrolling interests, YNDX shareholders saw a decline in net income of RUB 3.7 billion or 79.5% to RUB 951.0 million from 3Q 2019’s RUB 4.6 billion.Superficial annual comparisons between 2018 and 2019 were never going to be favorable due to the 2018 RUB 28.2 million Yandex.Market deconsolidation gain, but the very weak 4Q 2019 ensured that even adjusted comparisons would be ugly. Many of the expenses that contributed to that weakness, for example, staff, advertising and marketing, are controllable and might have reasonably been spread out into 1Q 2020.Did YNDX senior management decide to “trash” 4Q 2019 and set up strong 2019 - 2020 comparisons? Did Sberbank force faster investment - more expenses - into the Yandex.Market joint venture?How bad were the annual numbers? The green highlighted RUB 3.9 billion or 18.5% year-over-year increase in income from operations would seems pretty impressive, however, if you had been following the company all year, you would have known that YTD 3Q 2019 YNDX had reported a RUB 6.4 billion or 48.0% increase in income from operations. The company’s weak 4Q 2019, however, pasted the crooked label of mediocrity on the entire 2019 year.YNDX lost momentum over the fourth quarter in revenue growth, but the RUB 47.7 billion or 37.4% increase deserves a green highlight - that’s pretty impressive in an era where U.S. “blue chips” scrap for low single-digit organic growth. As we’ve seen with 4Q 2019, the RUB 43.9 billion or 41.1% growth in expenses - from a smaller base, here again highlighted in yellow, almost offset the strong revenue growth. Income from operations would have been up a very strong 31% if 4Q 2019 had matched 4Q 2018.Analysts were always going to exclude the 2018 RUB 28.2 billion Yandex.Market deconsolidation gain from annual comparisons, but other income proved to be the dagger to the heart of YNDX 2019 earnings anyway. Excluding the gain, other income was still down RUB 5.2 billion or 154.7%. Equity method investments were down RUB 3.7 billion from the previous year and other income/loss flipped to a net loss from net income in 2018 and declined RUB 2.3 billion or 206.2% year-over-year.Sberbank committed RUB 30.0 billion to Yandex.Market for an equal 45% share of the joint venture (10% was reserved for equity-based staff compensation) consisting of online marketplaces Beru.ru and Bringly.ru. As a result, GAAP required that YNDX deconsolidate the segment. As of April 21, 2018, Yandex.Market revenues and expenses no longer flowed through the corresponding YNDX income statement accounts and instead were reported in other income as an addition to net income or loss on equity method investments. The financial performance of Yandex.Market lost a lot of visibility.As of December 2019, Bringly was DOA with a cheeky R.I.P notice on its splash page. Beru, however, as we’ve seen, appears to be a going concern. After a reportedly rough beginning to the partnership, there were undoubtedly a lot of expenses incurred in 2019 to develop the online marketplace and secure merchandise partners. In fact, the Sberbank partnership had the effect of accelerating the Yandex.Market joint venture’s losses as the funds the bank committed allowed for a dramatic increase in expenses to build the business - and 45% of net losses flowed into the net loss on equity investments of YNDX.Other income / loss suffered from the large 4Q 2019 RUB 999.0 million Forex loss due to the appreciation of the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar.As we approach the bottom line is just gets messier. Net income before taxes was down RUB 29.6 billion or 56.4% - bad enough, but due to the non-deductible expenses we previously discussed; stock-based compensation, equity-method investments and goodwill impairment, income taxes in 2019 were actually higher than those in the much more profitable 2018 year. As a result, after accounting for noncontrolling interests, net income was down RUB 33.2 million or 72.1%.Here is an interesting final note about YNDX 2019 results. We’ve highlighted the income statement, but cash from operating activities? Stable at about RUB 8.6 billion from 2018 to 2019. There’s more. Cash from investing activities was positive RUB 8.1 billion in 2019, but not from incurring debt or selling businesses, about RUB 23.6 billion in cash was provided by term deposit maturities - more than enough to fund all investments in the YNDX business segments and roll RUB 14.7 billion right back into term deposits. YNDX cash balances increased RUB 12.9 billion in 2019, equivalent to about $193.5 million - not exactly a weak performance.Focused on the income statement, forward guidance and the coronavirus a lot of shareholders voted by hitting the “Sell” button.We haven’t talked about the second reason YNDX stock tanked after the 4Q Press Release. Throughout 2019 management ratcheted up its guidance for revenue growth from 30% to 34% 1Q 2019 to 36% to 38% 3Q 2019 with the actual number coming in at 37%, a number for which most high-tech CEO’s would gladly trade their Napa Valley second home.Search and Portal revenue guidance was 19% to 21% at the end of 1Q 2019, tightening up to 20% to 21% at the end of 3Q 2019 compared to an actual 21% for 2019.Then came guidance for 2020 in the 4Q Press Release:Total revenue growth was expected to slow 35% compared to 2019! Search and Portal revenue guidance was presented ex-TAC for the first time - not comparable to previous revenue guidance. Knowing TAC was 13.3% of total YNDX revenue in 2019 we can gross up the 15.5% mid-range guidance for Search and Portal revenue growth ex-TAC. The implication is that management is guiding for 17.9% Search and Portal revenue growth - down about 14.8% from the 21% reported in 2019.One caveat is that there is no guidance for adjusted EBITDA growth which does not necessarily depend on revenue growth. From 2018 to 2019 Search and Portal adjusted EBITDA increased 18.5%, matching the overall increase in income from operations, but the adjusted EBITDA of the Taxi and Classified segments both broke into positive territory after years of losses. It’s anyone’s guess as to what their growth rate will be going forward - and a possible IPO of the Taxi segment is the ultimate wild card.Typical valuation ratios and most comparisons with similar companies are uninformative for a company like YNDX. The cash flows of the relatively mature Search and Portal segment support a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis. A DCF, however, becomes problematic for a segment like Media Services which reported negative adjusted EBITDA, but would nevertheless have significant value to an acquiror. As a compromise, I have been using a combination of a DCF for the Search and Portal segment and other methods including price to sales multiples, public post-investment valuation estimates and rumored IPO pricing for other segments. Please note that 1) net segment non-operating assets are assumed to be included in any sale, 2) operating leases are treated as debt per current orthodoxy, 3) there is no provision for any acquisitions or divestitures, and 4) of necessity numerous other assumptions have been made. The resulting hybrid sum-of-the-parts valuation below has been updated and improved from the one presented after 3Q 2019 results.With management lowering expectations of future growth, the per share value of YNDX has declined slightly to $58.91 compared to the prior value of $59.02 per share.Search and Portal accounts for a smaller percentage of the overall value; $44.11 or 74.9% compared to $45.73 or 77.5% in the 3Q 2019 analysis. While the Search and Portal DCF starts from a higher adjusted EBITDA base, the growth rate is lower. This is intuitively appealing as we’ve seen that other segments are growing more rapidly and two, Taxi and Classified, produced positive adjusted EBITDA for the first time in 2019.Here's a simple way to bracket the per share values:If you agree with the assumptions made in this valuation, at $39.51 per share on March 6, 2020, there's a 10.4% discount to the value of Search and Portal alone and a 32.9% discount to the total value of Yandex.With any Russsian company there is always the question of the looming presence of the government. It is a fact that Vladimir Putin and his political affiliates, the United Russia party and the All-Russia People's Front, a coalition of parties and political organizations, control the government and major decisions in Russia. It is also a fact that YNDX is a technological champion for Russia - the “Russian Google.” The company is not just a leader in technology, but a source of national pride. It is extremely doubtful that Putin and his allies would do anything to seriously harm the company, but they will maintain ultimate control.SOURCE: kremlin.ruIn November 2019, an ally of Putin in the Russian Parliament submitted a bill limiting foreign ownership of Russian companies to 20%, but this was a pressure tactic to get YNDX management to agree to replacing the veto power of the “Priority Share” formerly held by Sberbank with greater indirect state control through various boards. In addition, there were sale and inheritance restrictions put on the stock held by CEO Volozh. After this, the Putin ally withdrew his proposed bill.Government-controlled Sberbank is often used as a funding mechanism to pump up targeted Russian companies with capital. As Sberbank began withdrawing from heavy involvement with YNDX - other than the Yandex.Market joint venture - in October 2019 it paid $177.0 million for a 2% ownership stake in Mail.ru that gave it 21% of the voting rights. Then, in November 2019 a new joint venture was announced combining the food delivery and taxi businesses of Sberbank and Mail.ru. The partners agreed to invest cash and/or assets of about $705.0 million at closing and up to an additional a $264.0 million, aiming at a $1.6 billion post-investment valuation.YNDX has a new, well-financed competitor, courtesy of the Russian government.With impeccable timing, on February 25, 2020, YNDX announced the offering of $1.25 billion in convertible senior notes due 2025. The notes will be convertible into Class A shares with an initial conversion price $60.0751 per share (subject to some conversion provisions) that may be satisfied at the company’s discretion with cash or shares.The notes will carry a 0.75% coupon - a significantly low cost of capital - and were underwritten by Goldman Sachs leading a heavyweight roster of syndication participants. Settlement and delivery were scheduled for on or about March 3.YNDX management stated that the proceeds would be used for general corporate purposes, capital expenditures, strategic investments or acquisitions and share buybacks, but that there were no pending current agreements or commitments for any material investment, acquisition, or strategic transaction.Several observations:If you want to pass on YNDX, I would not be surprised. YNDX is a 3 to 5-year investment and we’re in the middle of a coronavirus-induced stock market delirium which, in the short-run, makes a mockery of the efficient market hypothesis.SOURCE: Warren Buffett - Marketwatch February 25, 2020What to do?Pros:Cons:YNDX is a higher risk stock for adding some rapidly growing high-tech developing country exposure to a larger, established portfolio. With that understood, we could easily see YNDX appreciate 50% from the current levels to $60.00 per share over the next 3 to 5 years. For investors comfortable with the risks of the company and today’s market, buy at $40.00 or less per share."

Market share in Russia - 57%The management of Yandex recently informed investors about the growth of advertising revenue and an increase in the number of Yandex.Taxi rides in May compared to April. However, the bottom of the crisis in the advertising market may not have passed yet.Forbes Russia, referring to a Goldman Sachs report about Yandex, notes that the fall in the company's advertising revenue in May has slowed down. This April, advertising revenue of the company fell by 17-19% compared to April last year, and in May (up until May 22) it has fallen only by 7-9% year-on-year. Ad segments such as travel, cars, and real estate remain under pressure, while other segments show either growth or stagnation. The management seems to be confident about the operational metrics in the near-term and views April as a bottom, after which the profits will gradually recover.Conversely, some experts interviewed by Forbes are sure that it's too early to talk about any improvements, and the reduction in advertising costs is yet to come. The manager of one of the companies cooperating with Yandex stated that Yandex itself could have improved its performance, but the situation in the advertising market is still very tough: the largest advertisers face a reduction in revenues by 10% or more. He concluded that the advertising segment is still not at the bottom yet, and everything indicates that advertisers are going to have more financial problems in the near future.Yandex.Drive. Market share in Russia - 36%Among other Yandex segments affected by the virus, I also would like to highlight Yandex.Drive. Moscow Mayor's Office said that on the first day of carsharing services reopening, citizens rented only 5% of available cars. Experts note that the proper work of services is hindered by restrictions - mandatory passes and leases of five days or more.The prospects for Yandex.Drive look bleak for this year as there's a high probability that the company's biggest car fleet will mostly stay idle. The mayor of Moscow (where carsharing services are concentrated) said that the quarantine restrictions may be kept at least partially until a coronavirus vaccine becomes available. According to vc.ru sources, a downtime of cars within a month will cost each carsharing company about 500-700 million rubles ($7-10 mn) based on daily traffic of 50-70 thousand trips per day, a cost of 7 rubles per minute and average trip duration of 35 minutes.Yandex.Taxi. Market share in Russia - ~27-30%In late March, Yandex.Taxi withdrew the application for the acquisition of the Vezet taxi service. RBC sources note that Yandex decided to focus on supporting its current partners - drivers and taxi companies - in the face of declining market demand. For reference, Yandex.Taxi has agreed to buy call-centers and software of Vezet in July 2019. Under the terms of the deal, the current shareholders of Vezet were to receive up to 3.6% of Yandex.Taxi shares and up to $71.5 million when key indicators were achieved.The deal with Vezet, however, could come in handy amidst an upcoming threat from China - DiDi (DIDI), the biggest taxi service in China, comes to Russia. In May, DiDi started to recruit its first drivers in Russia. The company promises to charge drivers a commission of 5.5% per ride, which is significantly lower than the rates of competitors. The Yandex.Taxi commission in Russia depends on the distance and the cost of the ride. There are also fixed commissions: at the ""Economy"" tariff in the Moscow region, the commission amounts to 12%, and at ""Comfort,"" it amounts to 20.47%.In the meantime, Yandex.Taxi hopes to remain profitable in the second half of the year despite a sharp drop in demand due to restrictions amid the pandemic. The company forecasts that if demand falls by 60% in the second quarter, it will cause negative EBITDA, but a decline of 40% will allow the company to reach break-even. Let's see how the presence of DiDi will affect Yandex.Taxi earnings this year.The covid crisis also confounded the management's plans to hold a Yandex.Taxi IPO this year. Yandex Deputy CEO Tigran Khudaverdyan noted that the IPO of Yandex.Taxi is not on the company's top priority list at the moment. After the second quarter, probably, it would be possible to assess Yandex's chances of a successful IPO of its Taxi segment.Yandex is about to meet the key fundamental constraint every company faces in the Russian market: weak economic growth. Surely, the company can easily scale its internal startups like Yandex.Lavka in Moscow and Saint Petersburg, but outside these two cities, the company will inevitably face limited demand from the population with ever-declining income.The Russian economy, decimated by halved oil prices and inconsistent anti-virus actions of the government, will have a long way to full recovery. Here on SA, I often see comments that my view on the Russian economy is too gloomy. Let me clarify: in Russia, export-oriented and domestic-oriented companies live in two different worlds. The most concerning problem I see for the Russian economy is that its domestic-oriented part has been degrading for the last decade.Each consequent economic crisis in Russia after 1998 implied an adaptation to a new reality for the population: each time incomes diminished, the USD/RUB rate became higher, and the population had to consume less and less. This time is no exception: the currency rate crashed to 70-75 rubles per dollar, the GDP decline is estimated at 4-6%. For the year as a whole, the drop in real income of the Russian population may amount to 8 to 12%, according to calculations of the Higher School of Economics. I don't know by what miracle Russian companies like Yandex should thrive amid constantly declining purchasing power of Russians, but this fact seems to be hugely underestimated by analysts and investors.Source: TradingView, edited by AuthorIt seems it's time to formulate a Yandex version of Murphy's law: ""once the stock price surpasses its IPO price level, something bad will eventually occur reverting the price back."" This rule works surprisingly well throughout the whole history of Yandex as a public company.The stock has already got an appreciation for its recent successful growth and even looks a bit expensive for a Russian growth stock with a forward P/E over 44, considering that almost every Russian company has a specific ""geopolitical"" discount. Yandex, in turn, doesn't seem to have such a discount priced in, and this makes the stock even more expensive.While FAANGM companies continue to monopolize the whole clusters of the global economy even at the risk of being de-monopolized, Yandex will have to settle for the remains of the Russian economy already dominated by state-owned companies like Sberbank, Rostelecom, Mail.ru (which is de-facto state-controlled too), and others.The company's effectiveness is beyond doubt. Nonetheless, the impact of the pandemic on business, advertising costs, taxi rides is going to be long-lasting and decisive of the company's investment attractiveness in the future."

We hope you find it useful.Sign up for Let's Talk ETFs on the podcast platform of your choice to make sure you don't miss an episode:Jonathan Liss [JL]: For reference purposes, this podcast is being recorded on the afternoon of Monday, January 6, 2020.My guest today is Kevin Carter. Kevin is the founder of the Emerging Markets Internet & Ecommerce ETF (EMQQ) and Chairman of the EMQQ index committee. Prior to founding EMQQ, Kevin was the founder and CEO of AlphaShares, an investment firm offering five emerging markets ETFs in partnership with Guggenheim Investments. He is also the founder of Active Index Advisors acquired by Natixis in 2005 and of eInvesting, which was acquired by ETRADE in 2000.Welcome to the show, Kevin. It's a thrill to have you here.Kevin Carter [KC]: Thank you. It's great to be here, Jonathan.JL: Yes, absolutely. And we have lots to discuss here. There's definitely a lot going on in emerging markets right now. So, I expect this to be a very fruitful conversation. Before we get into your funds, specifically in your outlook for emerging markets, I think it would be great if you could tell our listeners a bit about yourself.How old were you when you first became interested in investing? And then, what drew you to ETFs, in specific, and when did that start exactly?KC: In college, I began to read a book or two a year on different things, investment and business related. And then, I graduated with a degree in economics and moved back to San Francisco. And I had one interview at an investment firm, called Robertson Stephens and Company, which was sort of the premier technology focused investment bank on the West Coast here in San Francisco.And my interview was about 25 minutes long. And the first 20 minutes we talked about Pac 10 basketball. And then, the guy interviewing me walked me through the investment business for a few minutes. And then, he said I could start Monday. And to which I replied, well, I don't know anything.And he wrote down on a piece of paper, the name of the book and told me to go buy it and read it before I showed up Monday morning. And so I did. And that book was called a Random Walk Down Wall Street. And so that was - before I even started, I had read that book. And I'm sure some of your listeners know about that book.JL: Yeah, sure, that famous tome by Burton Malkiel. Sure.KC: Correct. And you are one of the earliest proponents of indexing and ETFs, which didn't exist yet, at that time. But I read everything I could read about investing. And decided pretty quickly that I really believed in the Warren Buffett approach and really wanted to understand that. And it was a 'value investor'. And so, they'll be like pray towards Omaha.And it was in 1995, the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) annual report came out. And I was reading it. And there was a quote in the report, saying that most investors both institutional and individual would be better off with index funds. And that struck me as incongruent with my active beliefs. But I took the time to understand why he would say that and found the arithmetic of investing, which is a paper that Bill Sharpe wrote back in 1991.JL: Yeah, sent in the way that it just brings everything together also.KC: Yeah. I mean, it basically just pointed out that the case for indexing is basic math. And it's mathematically certain that the average active fund, as long as that's defined properly, will underperform the index fund if it's defined properly. And assuming that is an index fund that is low fee.So, that would seem very simple to me. And so, I realized there was a very strong case for index. It didn't mean I didn't believe in active investing. I just think that there are some challenges in delivering outperformance particularly in an overly diversified open-end mutual funds.So, I recognize that, but I still prayed towards Omaha. And then, I took a year off and got married and traveled around the world with my wife and including a lot of emerging markets importantly. And I got back from that trip. And I was interested in possibly investing in some of these emerging markets.And I had obviously seen the spider when it came out. I knew what it was, and why it was better than the traditional index fund. But, luckily, I don't realize that a large number of the first index funds were actually - I'm sorry, ETFs were actually called the WEBS the World Equity Benchmark Series.And these were a group of exchange traded funds that tracked a bunch of emerging markets. And they were set up by the World Bank to provide a way for institutions to get access to emerging markets. And then, they use this exchange traded fund concept.So, I got back from the trip, I found these webs, and I then started to read a book called Global Bargain Hunting, which was published around that time 1998 or so. And it was also written by Burton Malkiel. And it made the case for some of the developing world investment opportunities.And anyhow, I got back from my trip, and when I was traveling, I had sort of schemed up this idea with everything I knew about investing in the stock market and in sort of the delivery mechanism, the mutual fund industry. It occurred to me that there were better ways to do some of these things.And then in fact, there was concept I called perfect capital, which, first and foremost required that a fractional share brokerage platform needed to be built. So, people could buy stocks for $1 or $1.12 worth of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), you could buy stocks in dollar amounts instead of share amounts.JL: Sure, something that, incidentally, has been possible with mutual funds for, I guess, since mutual funds were rolled out.KC: Well, that was the reason that they were rolled out. And that's the reason they become such big businesses. These are the days when you had round lot issues, you had to buy 100 shares of any particular stock. And so, if you wanted to own 20 different stocks, and you had to buy 100 shares of each of them, it was $100,000 to do that.And so, most people don't have that much money at any given time. I mean the first part of perfect capital is you got to start saving regularly and that might be $115. It might be $500 a month. It might be $5 a week, but whatever it is, you got to start. And the only way to do it was to put it into a mutual fund a traditional mutual fund, because that would absorb your $162.15.And then, in order to cut out the mutual fund, we had to break the share barrier. And so, I had that idea. And I talked about it, but I wasn't really pursuing it. And then, in the fall of 1998, I'm an idealistic young value investor. And there was a week in the fall when I was short Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN).I thought Amazon.com is overpriced. I can buy Barnes & Noble or any of the other public real bookstores at much better valuations. And I shorted the stock and I lost about a third of my net worth in a day.And I also saw something that caught my attention which was a company called K-tel, which is had been a maker of rock albums that you could buy calling it 800 number, greatest rock of the 60s, whatever, stuff like that.And I knew about the company because I'd seen their ads when I was a kid. And they changed their name from K-tel to Ktel.com, and the stock went from $1 to $30. And I said, well, my goodness, I've read about this.And I went up to my bookshelf, and I found my Random Walk Down Wall Street, and I found the chapter on bubbles. And there was a quote from the 1960s, from Jack Dreyfus, the founder of Dreyfus Funds, talking about the technology bubble from the 1960s.And the quote said, take the company called Shoelaces Incorporated, changed the name to Silicon and Electronic Firth burners. And the stock can go up 10 times in price, just by changing the words. And I said, oh, my goodness, this just happened.I need to call this guy that wrote this book and tell him. And so, I use the search engine of the day, whatever that one was AltaVista to me...JL: LycosKC: ...Burton Malkiel in Princeton, and up came his splash page with his office hours and his phone number. And I said, I got to call this guy and tell him, and so I picked up the phone and dialed him. And he answered the phone, much to my surprise. I thought I'd get a secretary or something. I knew he was a pretty well-known person.And he answered the phone and I said, Dr. Malkiel, you don't know me, but you got to see this. It's right out of your book. And he was very nice. And asked me to fax them over the articles from Bloomberg or what have you. And that was really it.And then, six months later, when I was quite reluctantly convinced to start this fractional share brokerage firm eInvesting I called him and said, Dr. Malkiel would you consider being on my advisory board because I think this is a good thing for investors. And he said, yes, I think it's a good idea. But I want to meet you first. So, you got to come out here to Princeton, and meet me face to face.So, I got on a flight and went to Princeton, and we had a three hour lunch. And we've basically been working on different things ever since then. We sold eInvesting, as you mentioned to ETRADE in the year 2000. And then I had a year off and I was, continue to think about this perfect capital idea.And another we had built the fractional share part, the question was, okay, well, now I can invest regularly, but what do I buy? What do I put the money into? And I was sort of have two schools. My one part of me said, pray towards Omaha.I'm going to buy companies that have great moats and high returns on equity and assets and so forth. But I also understand that most people aren't going to be professional investors and they should probably by the index fund. But it still seemed like getting the mutual fund rapper out would be ideal.And so, Burt and I started talking over the phone. And we came up with this concept of active indexing, which has also become a thing now. That's it - I think it's been rechristened direct indexing. But the idea of Active Index Advisors was to make your own ETF, your own index fund, if you will, your own individual account that would seek to track the index, but it would allow you to customize it, you don't want tobacco stocks, you could leave those out.And then, it also offered the opportunity to indeed beat the index on an after-tax basis, if you are taxable investor. So, the idea was you could buy 50 stocks from the S&P 500 to simulate the return of the S&P the beta if you will. Not precisely the more stocks you use, the better, the closer.But with 50 stocks, you could eliminate most of the non-market risk. And then every quarter, you could sell the losers. So, if the auto industry was down, you could sell General Motors (NYSE:GM) and buy Ford (NYSE:F). And at the end of the year, you'd have more money than the index at least once the tax man came around.So, that was the idea of that company. And we started it and it was called Active Index Advisors. It's still called Active Index Advisors. And we sold it to Natixis (OTCPK:NTXFF) in the first week of 2005. So, maybe literally 15 years ago today, and the deal closed. But there was a couple of the things that happened around that time, that would later impact my life and lead me further into indexing and ETFs and into emerging markets.So, what happened was right before we sold, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) had gone public. And before they went public, they had a financial planning/investment planning seminar at the Google campus. And they asked a couple of people to come down and give presentations. And those two people were Bill Sharp, I believe, and Burton.And so, I wasn't involved with this. But I knew Burton had gone down there before the IPO and told the Google people what he thought they should do when they were rich. And soon after that, soon after we - right around the time we got acquired, I had a phone call from a guy that worked at Google, and he apparently Googled me, or rather the name of our firm after seeing Burton talk.And said, hey, I heard this guy Burton talk down here in Mountain View. I want to invest in this active indexing strategy. And I said great, well, who's your financial advisor? And he said, well, I don't have an advisor. And I said, well, we only work through advisors. We are available at Morgan Stanley, or Credit Suisse or Deutsche Bank currently.And he responded that he had no interest in that. And he wanted to know if you could invest directly with us. And I said, well, I'll come talk to you. So, I drove down to Mountain View one day and sat down with this guy and walked him through what we did. And he said, great, how much should I invest in that?And I said, I don't know? How much did you have? And he said, I have a lot. And I said, okay, well you're young. So, you should be aggressive, but you're already rich. So, maybe you should be moderate. And I don't know, maybe an allocation to U.S. equities of 20% or 25% makes sense.And then, he said, what about the rest of the money? And I said, well I will not do that? And he said, well, what would you do? And I said, well, I would probably just use a bunch of ETFs to finish the allocations.And he said, great, take all the money and go do that. So, then, I began using ETFs as sort of a building blocks for these - this particular Google employee and a few of his friends that sort of tag along with him. And then, this is how we get to China.So then, all of a sudden, I've got these guys as clients. And Burton publishes a piece in the Journal of investment consulting making the case for China. And it he'd been going back and forth to China with a couple of his colleagues from Princeton, who were Chinese nationals, and they had convinced him that he really had to see what was going on.And that they had indeed become quite capitalist and that they were booming, and they were coming back. And so, the paper was published, the Google people found out about it, and they asked if Burton could come to Google and talk about investing in China. I had never been to China before. And I was not involved in writing the paper, but I certainly read it.And so, we drove down to Mountain View one day when Burton was in town. And Burton gave his talk. And as soon as he was done, the Google guys looked at me and said, we want to invest in China. And so, pretty much from the moment that talk ended until this moment here presently. All that I've done is trying to figure out what does that even mean, and what's the best way to do it?How do you invest in China, and more broadly emerging markets? So, that that's how I got started in the investment business. How I got sort of pulled into indexing and how I got pulled into emerging markets where I've now been focused for 15 years.JL: Yeah, sure. And it's a great story. I like that a lot. Got a lot of moving parts there. So, just to kind of close the circle here. So, then, you have [indiscernible] five years ago. I guess after you had already founded AlphaShares, which is an emerging markets ETFs firm. I guess they manage the funds and Guggenheim was the custodian. Was that the arrangement there?KC: Yeah, well. So, what I left Active Index Advisors just at the end of 2016 after my contract was expired with Natixis. And Burton said, we got to do China, we got to do China. And first thing we did was we partnered with Guggenheim and began launching a series of China focused ETFs.And then, we also were managing a more active hedge fund type strategy that was a little bit more quantitative than I personally liked. It was sort of a smart beta for China and emerging markets. And so, AlphaShares is the company that we started with in partnership with Guggenheim.And, as I tell people, I can summarize everything I've learned in 15 years in two simple bullet points. Both of which I learned within an hour of getting back to the office from Google that day. Because I got back I said, all right, we got to invest in China.What does that mean? Well, let's just be I assume we'll buy the largest China ETF what is it? It's the iShares, China ETF with a ticker symbol FXI. And I said, great, give me a list of all the companies in the index. And before they gave me the list, Burton sort of pulled me aside and said, look, when you look at the companies in the fund, all of the top holdings are going to be Chinese government owned banks and oil companies.And I said, yeah, I've heard about that. That doesn't say down very good. I've been to the Department of Motor Vehicles and I don't think government owned entities are really the place to go for making money. And he explained to give me an analogy of a Chinese state owned manufacturing plant that's been losing money for decades.And it needs more money. It goes across town to the state-owned bank. A normal bank would say you didn't pay us back the last money. But the state-owned bank says, well, we can't lay off 15,000 people because they'll be up in industries protesting so the bank makes another loan. And that bothered me a lot.With my simple Warren Buffett had on, earnings equals value, growth of earnings equals growth of value and the companies that you are investing in, if the management team does not have that on their list of priorities, what's the point? And so that is the first rule. And then the second rule is that it's all about the consumer.The thing that's emerging are the people, billions of people, 85% of the world's people are in the developing world and they're moving on up. And I didn't have to figure this out. They handed me 100 page report from McKinsey that day when I got back to the office, showing how these billions of people wanted more and better food, more and better clothing, appliances, vacations, cars, and their kids to go to Harvard.And so those are really the only two things you need to know. And so, what I've, over those 15 years tried to do is minimize the exposure to the legacy economy to the corruption and things like Petrobras, which is [indiscernible] for state owned enterprises. And increase that exposure to the consumer.And so, I went always - when people would call me and ask me what's the best emerging markets ETF to buy? I would always tell them, I didn't tell them to buy any of my Guggenheim China funds, I told them to buy ECON, the emerging market consumer ETF, which I had nothing to do with.I knew about it. It was a fund that track the 30 largest emerging market consumer stocks. And it was the simplest way to answer the question. That's what you want. You don't want the banks and oil companies, you want the consumer. And in about six years ago, I told the Guggenheim people, I wanted to spend less time on the ETF stuff and I wanted to do my Omaha meets emerging markets attempts.And I set up a partnership and I bought six or rather five stocks. And I was going to go around town, one day with my hat to some investors. And I made some slides and one of the slides was these are the five stocks we own. We want to get exposure to emerging markets into this consumer story. These are the five stocks.The first three were stocks that were in ECON, so they were in the emerging market consumer index. They were the Chinese snack food maker, kind of the Di Bisco of China, trading in Hong Kong with the name Huan[ph]. And then maybe two Chinese basketball shoe companies also trading in Hong Kong that were part of ECON, leaning and peak sports for the Reebok and converse of China, if you will.But then, I have two other stocks that I own that were part of the consumer story, but the database said they were technology stocks. First one on the New York Stock Exchange, company called WUBA, W-U-B-A, that's the ticker symbol and the name. Wu is five and Ba is eight a mandarin so WUBA is 58, 58.com. This is the Craigslist of China.And the, second company I liked in technology stock that I thought played the consumer was a company on the NASDAQ called MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI). This is the leader in e-commerce and mobile payments in all of Central and South America, from Brazil to Mexico and everywhere in the middle.And I made that slide and I kind of looked at it, I thought, you can call these two technology stocks, but they're also consumer stocks. And the traditional consumer stocks were great. I thought they were growing at 10% or 20% at the top and had entrepreneurial management teams. But the two internet companies were growing at 100%.And in the case of WUBA had a 94% gross margin, which is where I looked for most with my Omaha head on. And so, I just remember thinking about that slide after I finished it and I printed up the deck and I went and saw my people and got some checks.And on my way back, I got a phone call from a friend with a three year old child. And she asked me what was the best ETF to buy for a long-term timeframe. What's the best emerging markets ETF? And I started to tell her to buy ECON, which is what I had always told people before.But I stopped myself and said, wait a minute, the best one doesn't exist. So, that was literally the light bulb moment for EMQQ. Because it really is what I realized it is all about the consumer, but the consumer is changing, not just in China, but everywhere, right? And I was watching how my family's consumption was changing.And in the last five years, I'd say, when I got that call that day, my family was probably going to target four times or five times a week. But all of a sudden there was a truck showing up in front of my house once a week.And now we know we all know the story. Now my family goes to target once a month and the trucks come to our house almost for certain at least 10 times a week, and obviously we just came to the holiday. So, there was probably some weeks we had 20 deliveries. But, so what I realized is that the way consumption happens is changing.But it's changing even faster in the developing world. Because we have really good consumption infrastructure, right? We have target stores, we have bank accounts. Most of the world's never had these things.The other thing is that's happening is really EMQQ is a confluence of three mega trends happening at the same time. It is emerging market consumer wave, which is well documented, McKinsey calls it the greatest growth opportunity in the history of capitalism. That wave of consumers is they're getting their first ever computer when they get a smartphone, right?We've had computers for a long time. I've had a desktop computer in my life for 30 years. The smartphone, which I've had for about 10 years, was not my first computer, it just happened to fit in my pocket. And the third trend is the internet. We've had the internet for a long time. And we take it for granted.Most of the world has never had the internet. So, you're giving this giant wave of consumers, their first computer and their first internet access. And I believe that it's not just the fastest growing sector in the world. I think it may be the fastest growing sector in the world ever.JL: Yes, sure. Now, I mean, I think there's definitely a lot of demographic data to support that. I'm just curious in terms of why now is the time for investors to be upping their exposure two emerging markets and specifically two emerging markets, technology and consumers.So, emerging markets have clearly significantly underperformed their developed market counterparts over the past decade. Do you look back, let's say on a five year total return basis, XLK, the spider technology fund, which invests in those stocks in the United States that fall into the technology sector is up 135% over the last five years versus 60% for your fund, which, to some extent could mean that the the run-up hasn't really happened yet. And so, the opportunity is still really there.So I'm curious if you could make the case for why now specifically, is the time for investors to be rotating some of that money from developed tech companies or funds into the emerging market equivalent?KC: Well, you're obviously right about the strength of the United States developed market. I don't know if the European and other developed markets have done anything like the U.S. has done. But you're right, we've had a good run, and the tech stocks have done better. Now, importantly, I believe that the product you're referencing also owns the hard tech, the apples of the world, but nonetheless -JL: Yes, and also GICSs, they've moved some things around. So, things that used to be tech ... they've shifted things around to some extent [into other sectors].KC: I know that very well because it's affected our lives very directly. And so, every shop what it means to be a tech company. And I think that's emblematic of exactly what I saw, which is, you can call MercadoLibre, a technology stock but when people that are using it or buying the stuff they would otherwise buy at Walmart.There is a lot different than making parts for an iPhone. So, when it comes to visit a good time to buy something, ultimately, I don't believe I can time the stock market. And as Burton likes to say, I've never met anybody that can time the stock market and I've never met anybody that's met anybody.So I look at the numbers, I look at the valuation and the growth rate, because that's ultimately all that really matters. If you're a fundamental investor, the PEG ratio. I think one of the things that people misunderstand is what is a 'value investor' and what does Warren Buffett do and it's not about finding the cheapest stuff, it's about finding the best stuff at good prices.And so, I care about the growth rate as well as the PE multiple. And right now, the emerging market's internet space, the EMQQ index has a PE of about 25. And it has top-line revenue growth, that's averaged 38% a year for the last decade, and is still growing, I mean you don't have the final numbers for 2019. But the revenue growth for the sector is going to be about 30% likely a little above 30%.So the PE to growth rate is below 1, call it 0.8, the S&P 500 has a PE of about 20. And it has revenue growth of 5%. So, you're paying a small premium on a PE basis, but you're getting 6 times the growth. So, I don't make short-term predictions. But I think investors that have 3 to 5 years and appropriate timeframe for emerging markets, I think they'll do very well.And then, well I don't think of any of - what I'm about to say, as there's no math to support this. But my gut is that right now is a pretty good time. Now we've had a good run up last year, I know the enable index was up over 30%. But the PEG ratio is still good and if you think about sentiment. And there is - Warren Buffett says, you pay a high price for cheery consensus, right?When everything looks rosy stocks might be fully valued. And the converse of that must also be true, when things look bad is probably when you're going to get your best values. And it was a couple or 3 months ago, when I had this sort of epiphany of you know what this is - even though we're are up 20% or so for the year. This is a good time to be buying.If you believe that bad sentiment is a good time to buy. Because you retrace the last year and a half. We've had an all-out economic war, at least in the headlines and saber rattling between us and the second largest economy in the world.You've had the President of the United States threatened to delist half of the companies that are part of the EMQQ Universe. You've got violent warfare in the streets of Hong Kong, including protesters, beating policemen with metal poles and getting shot.So you've literally got blood in the streets of Hong Kong and it's on TV, by the way, every weekend. And then my epiphany came, I was in Arizona. My son is a sophomore at the University of Arizona where I went to school, and we were doing some marketing meetings in Scottsdale.And then, towards end of the week, I was going to drive down to Tucson for parent's weekend. And I woke up in the morning and the headline had to do with the general manager of the Houston Rockets, sending a tweet about supporting the Hong Kong protests. And within 24 hours, another person, another media person had asked LeBron James for his opinion and he declined to back the opinion of the general manager of the rockets. And they were burning LeBron James jerseys on the streets of Hong Kong.And then, some other media person asked Steve Kerr who coaches the Golden State Warriors. What his opinion was and he said he didn't have one. And then, the President of the United States sent a tweet calling Steve Kerr a scared little boy, and I just couldn't help it sort of laugh and say you can't even make this stuff up, right?And ironically, I was on my way to the University of Arizona that weekend and I'm thinking okay, this guy that was, a guy around our apartment building that was a basketball player and is now the general manager of the pro team I root for. Somehow the President of the United States is tweeting about this person.And I just thought, you know what, this is a good time to buy. I feel good, right? Other bad things can happen and I guess we've had some global stress over the last several days, involving Iran. So, who knows what will happen? I feel pretty good right now, based on both my gut but much more importantly based on the valuation versus the growth rate, because this is a long-term secular story.JL: Okay. So, this find EMQQ is really heavily tilted to China and nearly 60% leaning waiting at present. And that means that theoretical geopolitical and economic risks some of which you've touched upon already, should China enter a prolonged period of economic downturn or political upheaval.So how do you address this concern - is this - first of all, how did the waiting end up being so heavily to China? Is it just a result of the underlying market caps of the companies that have been selected for the index or how did you end up in that place exactly?KC: Well, I mean yeah, this is a rules based index approach. So, we own, every publicly traded emerging markets or frontier markets internet company. And it just so happens that the largest number of those and the largest of those are Chinese, which makes sense since China has the world's largest population.It has at least the second largest economy in the world. And it does have the largest internet economy in the world with the most internet and mobile internet users. So, China will almost certainly be the largest weight for at least a decade are very likely longer. So, that's where the companies are.And I would say one other thing that I've a lot of things about indexing and databases that are not as precise as I think maybe people would like to think. And the country classification system sometimes doesn't capture the reality of the financial statements. So, for example, MercadoLibre, MELI is technically an Argentinian company, is headquartered in Buenos Aires.So factsheet might say detected earlier this year, it was our best performing stock and it got - it doubled basically in the first half of the year and it went up to 10% of the fund before we rebalance in the fact sheets that we have 10% in Argentina.So the numbers that you'll find from the database are approximately right, but they're not super precise. And there's exposures that may not totally appear as what they are and a couple examples of this. Now Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) owns almost half of a private company in India called PayTM, which is a leader in mobile payments. Well, that doesn't - that's an Indian exposure, that doesn't show up on the factsheet.JL: Just shows that there's China on the factory obviously.KC: Right. And then they also own Lazada (LZDA), which is Southeast Asian and operates in a number of countries. So, but you're right, it is the biggest piece. And in terms of the political risk. I mean, I am a person that obviously, I've been doing this for a long time now.But I don't think people in United States really understand China and what it is, and I think there are lots of people invest in business and have never even been to China. Never actually seen it. I've been on the ground, which I always strongly recommend people just take the time to go do that because it will almost certainly change your anyone's perspective on what China is.But I think China is a very stable place for the most part, their government. While there are parts of the government we find distasteful, it's certainly an effective government. I mean, they've brought hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, and they get stuff done.And so I think they're sort of domestically in good shape. I think that - I think to the extent the - that our government sort of re-stokes the trade battles with China in an aggressive way. I think that's not good for markets, certainly the mark-to-market will likely react poorly to that. But the fundamental story of EMQQ really shouldn't be affected.And indeed the consumption is where the growth is in China and the government has been trying to recalibrate their economy towards consumption and they've been quite successful in doing that. But there's still a long way to go. So, I don't think that at least the geopolitical risks that we've seen related to China are things that are going to affect the fundamentals of the companies that are part of EMQQ.JL: Sure, yeah, no, I think that's well put. And then in terms of the index itself. So, there's a couple of decisions that you've made there that seemed fairly unique to me. And I'm curious what the origin of these decisions is. And I'm sure they were done to benefit investors and produce smoother returns or better returns.So, the two things that I happen to pick up on that that stuck out at me were first of all, the 8% waiting cap on the top holding. And then secondly, limiting of the index to companies with ADRs or GDRs or similar share structures. Can you explain these two decisions and what the reasoning for them was or is and how they benefit investors?KC: Well, let me answer the second question first. We have not chosen to limit the holdings to U.S. listed companies. In fact, we own stocks traded all over the world. But it so happens that the majority of the internet companies in the developing world have chosen to list on our exchanges.And more than almost two-thirds or even three quarters of the EMQQ market cap is trading on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ. And this is a big benefit for investors. It's not a decision we made. We own stock that's in Hong Kong or India or Brazil or Russia wherever.These companies, I said earlier that the biggest problem in emerging markets is corporate governance. Most of these companies have been started by local entrepreneurs, but funded by U.S. institutional investors. And that is why they trade here. Because if you're Harvard or Stanford, or Berkshire Hathaway, which has an investment in a couple of EMQQ related companies, you want your companies to have the highest listing standards and the most transparency.JL: Yeah, [indiscernible] it's actually you don't really want any shenanigans on the accounting side and obviously, listing in the U.S. or in Europe guarantees that there's full transparency there.KC: Well, yes. Nothing's guaranteed. That doesn't guarantee it. But in a part of the world where you've got things like Petrobras that have been ripping off money from shareholders and there's two presidents of Brazil are in jail right now for malfeasance with regards to their state owned enterprise, Petrobras.These companies have the best corporate governance. This is why they're here. But we don't, that's not a rule it just so happens that that's the way it's played out, which I think is good for investors. And then, the other question, the 8% cap weight. So, this is a market cap weighted index. But with one modification, which is actually something you'll find in many single country ETF, for example.Alibaba and Tencent (OTCPK:TCEHY), the two largest holdings have combined market value of about $1 trillion. These are very big businesses, and still growing very fast by the way. And if we put them in at a pure market cap weight, we would defy some registered investment company diversification rules that is sort of an obscure rule called the 5-50 rule that says that companies with a 5% weight or more cannot total 50%. So, we put in place an 8% cap, which basically lowers the concentration in Alibaba and Tencent.JL: Sure, and I guess there is an added benefit there of not having too much single company risk.KC: Yeah, that's clearly, yes, one of the benefits of that.JL: Yeah. Okay. Awesome. And just so I think some of the bigger names in the portfolio, Tencent, Alibaba, Baidu (BIDU), will be more familiar to U.S. investors. And I was just curious if there was a smaller name or two in the portfolio that you could speak to a bit just to kind of give listeners an idea, some of the diversification available here and some of the companies that maybe they're a little less familiar with, that they would also be gaining access to if they were to invest in EMQQ.KC: Sure. Well, let me first say a couple things about Alibaba and Tencent that I think are perhaps under appreciated.JL: Okay.KC: Well, people certainly know these companies and obviously Alibaba is the best known because it went public in a big splash here, but Tencent's a Hong Kong listed company that's almost as big as Alibaba.And we use a lot of shorthand descriptions of these companies just to paint a picture. The Craigslist of China, the Amazon of Brazil, whatever.JL: The Google of China, right, et cetera.KC: Exactly. And so I think a lot of people have that level of familiarity. But what people don't appreciate with Alibaba and Tencent is that they are in fact super apps, they are platforms. And Tencent, as you may know, amongst their businesses is WeChat. It is the 'Facebook' of China. When we tell people what's Tencent, it's the Facebook of China.So you can say that, it is the social network, but you cannot call Facebook the Tencent of the United States. And the reason is that because Alibaba and Tencent both have basically a billion users, and because the traditional infrastructure, bank accounts, shopping malls, these things are underdeveloped, and under penetrated in the developing world.And it allows Alibaba and Tencent to go into different verticals that their U.S. counterparts have not done in United States. And by far right now, the most important part of d story is FinTech, financial services going on to the smartphone. And it's a big, big deal.And anyone that has been to China in the last several years knows it. Every place you want to spend money, and I don't care if that's the grocery store, or literally the beggar on the street with cardboard, you're going to find two QR code, one for WeChat Pay and one for Alipay. So, Tencent's payments platform and Alibaba's payments platform. And those two companies have over 90% of the mobile payments market in China.My last trip to China was actually the first time I was denied purchasing something with cash. I tried to buy a bottle of water in the Nanjing train station with currency and they said I couldn't have it. I could only use my phone. And meanwhile up on the street, I could also buy a pigeon with my phone, but I couldn't buy a bottle of water with cash.So - and this is important because once you have the money on your phone, there's a lot of things you can do with it. And Alibaba's payments platform Alipay is recently valued at $150 billion. And Alibaba now has for example, the largest money market fund in the world.So, people in developed world are not quite appreciating how big this mobile money and FinTech thing is. And it's sort of a paradox, you would think that someone like me that lives in the San Francisco Bay area that worked in FinTech, in a lot of ways for the last 20 years, it seems like I should be of the humans on this planet, the person that's walking around paying for things like he's in the Jetsons with my phone, it’s not. I use my phone to buy stuff at Starbucks or 7-Eleven. But it's not something I can use everywhere.And meanwhile, Africa has the highest penetration of mobile payments. So, it's this paradox, it's this leapfrogging that's going on that is allowing Alibaba and Tencent to do a lot more than what an American might think of their businesses. And that goes to all parts of the economy, where this leapfrogging is going on and Alibaba and Tencent are competing in lots of different things.JL: Wow. That's really fascinating and as you say really unexpected also.KC: Yes. And a very exciting part of the story.JL: Yeah.KC: In terms of lesser known names in China Pinduoduo, which has a ticker symbol PDD, here in the United States. This is a fascinating upstart shopping app. But it's focused on third and fourth tier cities in China and third and fourth tier consumers. The founder who's a former Googler calls it a combination of Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and Disneyland.The Chinese are very, the game of Phi [ph], if you will, a lot of things so this is a mash up of a shopping app, and a group buying app with a heavy social element that's really stormed the Chinese market out of nowhere in less than five years.I think it may have a bigger market cap in JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) at this point. In South America, my favorite story from 2019 there was a Brazilian payments company called StoneCo. (STNE) went public on the NASDAQ. And Berkshire Hathaway was a large buyer at the IPO price. So, that's an example of a less well known company in South America.And in Eastern Europe, whatever holdings a Russian company called Yandex (YNDX) on the NASDAQ. And again, this is the 'Google of China' it's been public in the U.S.JL: Russia.KC: I'm sorry, Russia. It's been public here in the US for a decade, [indiscernible]. And interestingly, Yandex in addition to being the search leader in Eastern Europe, it's also the Uber (NYSE:UBER) of Russia. Yandex Taxi is the leading ride hailing app in Russia. And San Francisco based Uber went to Russia and tried to compete with Yandex, and they forfeited. And they went to Yandex and said, hey, we're leaving, can we have some stock if we give you what we built.So Yandex taxi is, at least according to the media, preparing to IPO this year. And Uber is a minority shareholder. So, Yandex, the Google of Russia, is now going to give birth to the Uber of Russia in partnership with Uber. So, that's an exciting story to look out for in the beginning of the year.And then finally, in Africa, the company that we own that I would focus on is a recent IPO on the New York Stock Exchange called Jumia (JMIA), on the NYSE. And Jumia is a Nigerian leader in ecommerce that operates in 10 or 12 other countries in Sub Saharan Africa.Now Jumia, it came public. We were excited about it, because it put a flag into that part of the world. Everybody's getting smartphones and the internet and changing everybody consumes even in Africa.And now, it's been a very volatile ride for the company since it went public. I got a call from a reporter before the IPO. And she said, well, what do you think of the Jumia IPO. How do you think it's going to do? And I said, well -- I mean she pointed out, they're losing money.And I said, well, when you phone me, I was reading the Uber prospectus and lots of companies go public when they're losing money, including the company in Seattle whose founder has his own rocket ships.And so you can go public with losses, when I said to where I said. So, I don't know what the analysts that are going to be looking at this at fewer price or whatever, I don't know what they're going to be looking for in terms of the valuation and so forth. But your headline's going to probably call this the 'Amazon.com' of Africa, and investors are going to see that and go, oh my gosh, I got to get it on that.So it sounded like a ground floor opportunity, at least the headline. And sure enough this stock, I think tripled in the first week or two, only to then be the subject of a short seller report. And it's now selling I think for half of its IPO price.So but nonetheless an example of ecommerce in all emerging and frontier markets in Jumia. And another reason why you might use an ETF for a space like this because maybe it's not the Amazon.com of Africa.JL: Yeah, you definitely don't want this single stock risk, that's for sure.KC: Yes, so those are some of the examples of less well-known companies that are part of EMQQ.JL: Yeah, no, this has been great, Kevin. Really interesting. I am definitely getting a bunch of names to research here myself and portfolio is got just a really interesting mix of companies and in it. I'm just curious what the future holds for the EMQQ team. Are you guys working on any new indexes or fund launches or just planning on focusing on EMQQ for now.KC: No, we have a very singular focus, I believe in focus. And more importantly, as I said earlier, this is I believe, I'm not 100% sure of anything but I'm 99.9% sure that this is not just the fastest growing sector in the world, but indeed the fastest growing sector in the world ever.I've proposed that to hundreds of people or thousands of people to whom I presented in the last five years and no one's ever challenged it. The robotics people like that sought there 17% or 18% revenue growth.So, I think this is the fastest growing sector in the world and it's a fun sector. I mean it's fun to see how these emerging markets are and the consumers in these markets are - they're getting their first taste of technology, they’re getting their first connection to the world. And they're - it's like, as one individual, an Indian guy that was profiled in a Wall Street Journal said, it says if he's falling into a sea of information. And anything he wants he can find in his pocket. So, it's an exciting story and I think that it'll be a while before we think of moving on to something else to focus on.JL: Sure, yeah. It's a great story and definitely an evolving one also. For listeners that wanted to research these topics further to research EMQQ further, what's the best place for people to find it online?KC: Emqqetf.com is the website for the ETF that tracks the index.JL: Sure. And I would like to just point out that in addition to the usual stuff that investors can expect, typical factsheet and top holdings, there's some great infographics on that site are linked to from there also, and some great video appearances of yours. So, definitely worth checking out on that front.And then what about social media, are you or EMQQ active on social at all?KC: On LinkedIn, is the best place to follow us there. My name.JL: All right, anyway, Kevin, this has been really great. Appreciate the opportunity to have you weigh in on emerging markets and emerging markets technology specifically. And I hope we can do it again sometime.KC: Okay, Jonathan, thanks so much and Happy New Year.JL: Yeah, you too."

For others, the situation is just an another short-term speculative opportunity.","Yandex's (NASDAQ:YNDX) shares are volatile amid the discussion of the notorious ownership law, though a glimmer of hope has finally appeared in this story. I still expect that relations between the Russian government and Yandex will continue to be strained and this will be one of the key factors limiting the stock's upside in the long term. However, in the short term, there's an almost no-brainer trade - just buy Yandex shares before the coming Q3 financial results and sell shortly after their announcement.On October 11, Yandex's shares went down by almost 20% during the day. The stock collapsed after the meeting of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy, where lawmakers discussed draft legislation that would limit foreign ownership in ""significant information resources"" (including Yandex) to 20 percent.At the State Duma committee meeting, lawmakers couldn’t come to a unanimous decision about the bill. Committee chairman Leonid Levin said that a final decision on the legislation won’t be made until November. Spokesmen of Megafon, Rosneft (OTC:OCRNL) and industrial associations who were present at the meeting criticized the project.In turn, representatives of the Federal Antimonopoly Service and Roskomnadzor told that they conceptually support the legislation, but some parts of it require clarification. An employee of the Ministry of Communications said that the ministry sent a negative review to the Gorelkin bill.Later, the government prepared feedback on the bill. It is ready to support the document with some important adjustments - foreign participation in significant information resources regarding voting shares should be acceptable at the level of 50% minus one share. In addition, the bill should include clear criteria for classifying an information resource as significant in order to avoid ""subjective assessments.""Source: the State Duma websiteAnd now just look how quickly Russian officials can do a 180:The reaction of investors wasn't long in coming:Source: Seeking AlphaIn a matter of hours, the stock won back almost half of the losses of the last two weeks. Why only half of the losses? Firstly, this is feedback, not a final amendment. Secondly, now it has finally been confirmed that all this is not the initiative of just one deputy.Assuming that the law will comply with the recommendations of the government, Yandex, by and large, would be able to breathe a sigh of relief. The largest individual shareholders - Arkady Volozh and Vladimir Ivanov - own shares that provide more than half of the voting power in the company. Not to mention the so-called ""golden share"" owned by the state-controlled Sberbank (OTCPK:SBRCY).Despite the fact that the negative consequences of this bill would likely be avoided, there are two more unpleasant bills that are still under consideration in the State Duma: the law on state regulation of taxi operations and aggregators (adopted at second reading, one reading left) and the law on news aggregators (adopted at first reading, two readings left). The main purpose of the first bill is to raise passenger transportation safety at the expense of such taxi aggregators as Yandex.Taxi and the second law proposes to limit foreign ownership of Russian Internet news aggregators like Yandex.News. Even if these bills are adopted in an extremely mild form, they will still be sources of volatility of the stock price if the government returns to a discussion of these laws.It's absolutely clear that the Russian government doesn't care about Yandex as a publicly-traded company because it communicates with the company in a completely barbarian way. On the one hand, Russian officials call Yandex a strategically important company for Russia; on the other hand, they introduce potentially devastating laws and then change them on the fly to more soft options. If this is a way of communication, this is a bad way of communication. If this is a way of trading stocks, then Russian lawmakers are pretty skilled insider traders.This is an obvious state policy: the state wants to control everything that is connected with the media, with communications, with search engines, everything that is generally connected with the ability to access any information. Therefore, it's still a big question of how Yandex and the Kremlin will co-exist further comfortably.For now, the main positive news of this week will be the publication of Q3 financial results that are almost guaranteed to beat expectations, so those who recently bought the stock can earn some money on this short-term trade. If you're bullish on the long-term prospects of Yandex and for some reason haven't bought the stock yet, that's a good time to start buying Yandex."

Volozh also won't be able to sell 95% of his class B shares for two years.All this seems to solve the problem for Yandex. Although it cannot be said that the regulatory risks of Yandex have completely disappeared, the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company has clearly decreased significantly, and this is very positive news for the company. Foreign investors were virtually unaffected, and the management can now focus on developing the business and the preparation of Yandex Taxi IPO, rather than negotiating with the authorities.Another news worth mentioning is a recently announced buyback program of up to $300 million which will last for a period of up to one year. This is a pleasant bonus, but not a big deal really. For Yandex, $300 million is about 3% of its free-float or 2.6% of total capitalization. Yandex's trading volumes are around $80-100 million on the NASDAQ and $15-20 million on the MOEX, so if the buyback is carried out on daily basis for 12 months, the repurchase volume will be around 1% of the average daily turnover, which is an insignificant value.Overall, the stock has finally returned to price levels where it should be considering the company's impressive operating performance.What will change for the company? Next to shareholders, the board of directors and top managers will appear in a new and not yet very clear structure. It sounds pretty - Public Interest Fund, but the objective needs to be clarified. Though the staff of universities and non-profit organizations form the basis of the fund, its composition, and the whole structure was agreed upon by the presidential administration. So the interest here is not public, but quite state.In fact, the Russian government has got a kill switch to be used if Yandex does something ""wrong"". Besides that, the PIF can easily be used to promote censorship in Yandex services, as well as impose Yandex's participation in government projects on disadvantageous terms. The existing solution is no doubt better than nationalization, but still a trade-off of the company's independency.What will be the next part of the drama between the state and Yandex? The law on state regulation of taxi operations and aggregators, which is adopted at second reading out of three, can become a new headache for the company. The closer the IPO of Yandex Taxi will be, the more news about this bill we'll hear."
4299542,104669,2019-10-28T09:13:01-04:00,"Yandex published solid Q3 results.Despite the EPS miss, the company shows spectacular growth in most segments.Strong fundamentals continue to be overshadowed by uncertainties over the ownership law.","Yandex's (NASDAQ:YNDX) results once again turned out to be better than the consensus forecast of analysts who expected a revenue increase of 36%. The net income is slightly lower of analysts' expectations, however, the revenue growth is more important as the company is actively investing in a large number of new business areas. The revenue forecast for 2019 has been raised 3 times already, which indicates the confidence of management in further growth prospects. At the same time, it seems that investors are not in a hurry to buy the stock waiting for more clarity around the draft law.According to the company, the largest contribution to revenue growth was made by the Search segment, Yandex.Taxi and Yandex.Drive. Overall revenue increased by 38% to 45 billion rubles.Source: Company data, author's spreadsheetAdjusted Net Income that differs from US GAAP net income mainly by adding non-cash stock-based compensation (SBC) expenses amounted to 6.9 bn rubles this quarter.Source: Company data, author's spreadsheetThe bulk of Yandex's revenue has always come from Search & Portal segment. The segment's revenue grew by 21%. The company continues to hold a search share in the Russian market just above 50%; over the past quarter, it hasn't changed much.Source: Company data, author's spreadsheetTaxi revenue (22% of total revenue) increased by 89%. Yandex.Taxi continues to show a slowdown in revenue, but it is difficult to consider it as a negative point. Given the rapid increase in the base numbers, it is almost impossible to maintain a continuous triple-digit growth rate. The segment's EBITDA remains in positive territory, amounting to 170 million rubles vs. -711 million rubles a year earlier.Source: Company data, author's spreadsheetThe revenue of the remaining segments (21% of total) continues to grow at a fast pace. The classifieds segment showed a revenue growth of 39% (a slight slowdown) and a slight plus on EBITDA. No further details were disclosed on the segment. Media Services revenue grew by 123%, the growth rate accelerated for 3 consecutive quarters.The experiments segment expands tremendously - 176% year-on-year. This segment includes Yandex.Drive, Zen, Geo services, cloud services, and other new business areas.Source: Company PresentationYandex.Zen generates almost half of the segment's revenue, 1.9 out of 4.1 billion rubles. Year-on-year growth of 62%, 12.5 million DAU, and 59 million MAU are impressive numbers for the Russian market, given the fact that the entire audience of the Russian internet is around 90 million people. Yandex car sharing is growing at an insane pace, now Yandex.Drive has more than 16,500 cars, although 3 months ago there were only 10,000. Yandex.Drive is the second car sharing company in the world by fleet after Share Now which is a joint venture between Daimler and BMW with 20,000 cars.Yandex raised the forecast for total revenue growth this year from 32-36% to 36-38% Y-o-Y excluding Yandex.Market and the forecast for revenue growth for the search segment from 19-21% to 20-21% Y-o-Y.I have to admit that I was wrong about my ""no-brainer trade"" - the stock slightly declined after the financial report. Now the stock direction will largely depend on the news about the previously discussed ownership law. At the company's conference call, the head of Yandex Arkady Volozh reaffirmed that the company will make every effort to protect its shareholders. Also, any decisions regarding changes in the corporate structure will be discussed by the board of directors and the general meeting of shareholders. According to the management, the authorities heard some of the company's arguments regarding the law, but it's hard to say what the final version of the bill will look like.Unfortunately, during the conference call, the management didn't say anything about the Yandex.Taxi IPO, so there's no new information on this subject. In general, the results are without any significant surprises, the business is growing very well and so far there are no reasons why the situation may change."
4309984,103815,2019-12-02T06:32:34-05:00,"Today’s Yandex is a $13.8 billion market cap grab-bag of high-tech companies providing a bet on a number of high-potential business models.Income from operations has been in a steady uptrend; growing from RUB 9.5 billion in 2015 to RUB 20.8 billion in 2018, a 21.6% CAGR.Yandex put up some big growth numbers YTD 3Q 2019; increases of 39.3% in revenues and 48.0% in income from operations.Political risk is a reality, but it is extremely doubtful that Putin and his allies would do anything to seriously compromise the viability of the company.I consider the stock a buy at the current $41.95 where it is 40% undervalued.","I watched one of my favorite YouTubers, Sergey Baklykov, demonstrate carsharing in St. Petersburg, Russia. He mentioned an unfamiliar company named ""Yandex"" (NASDAQ:YNDX) so I tracked it down. No, Yandex is not a Russian version of Xanax or a new stretch fabric. Yandex is a Russian technology company with operations analogous to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). While not well-known in the U.S., this is not an obscure Internet cash-burning machine. Yandex employs about 9,500 people, reported 2018 revenues of $1.8 billion, net income of $660.1 million, and a market cap of about $13.8 billion - and it's growing at a 40% rate! Were the Russians trying to influence my 2019 investment decisions?After some research, I bought a few shares on November 11, 2019, at $34.19 per share. As of November 29, I was up 22.7% - a rare occurrence for me. So why did a 3- to 5-year hold, value-oriented investor buy stock in the ""Russian Google?"" Let me explain…Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) had Gates and Allen, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) had Jobs and Wozniak, Yandex had Volozh and Segalovich. Beginning in 1993, lifelong friends Arkady Volozh and Ilya Segalovich worked together to develop a state-of-the-art internet search engine derived from an earlier Volozh project. At the time internet search was dominated by information indexing web-crawlers. The friends invented the word ""Yandex"" which stood for ""Yet Another iNDEXer"" to describe their search software.Ilya Segalovich and Arkady VolozhSource: theguardian.comThe Yandex.ru search engine was launched on September 23, 1997 - about a year before Google's search engine was publicly demonstrated - and presented at the Moscow Softool exhibition. In 2000 Yandex was incorporated with Volozh as CEO and Segalovich as CTO until his death from cancer in 2013.Today's Yandex is a grab-bag of high-tech companies providing a bet on a number of high-potential business models. You don't have to search for the best Russian search engine, ride-sharing business, online auto classifieds or vertically-integrated TV / video / music streaming portal; Yandex has them all.Roughly 70 different services - in many cases the Russian version of a familiar U.S. counterpart - are under the Yandex umbrella. These businesses are divided into six main segments, Search and Portal, E-Commerce, Taxi, Classifieds, Media Services, and Other Bets and Experiments.Before we reach into the grab-bag, I need to warn you that data on the markets Yandex businesses serve is sometimes sketchy - at least for this non-Russian speaker. View this data as indicative, not authoritative.At the end of each of the following sections, I will assign a grade to each segment.Accounting for 76% of 2018 revenues, almost entirely from online advertising, the Search and Portal division offers services in Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Turkey. This part of the company is like a Russian mini-Google, even the Yandex search portal looks familiar - a lot of white space:Source: yandex.comLike Google's search portal, you can search the web, videos, images or full-function maps, create an email account and access a translation function. There's also AppMetrica, a marketing platform, and a web browser. Yandex has a virtual assistant called Alice - think Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa - now being deployed across the company's consumer-oriented products. For mobile users, there's Yandex Search App, enhanced with Alice, with Search, Maps, News, Weather, etc. In December 2018, the app had 36 million users per month, a 100% increase over the prior year.Yandex is in a fight with Google for market share in Russia. According to Yandex, using its own Yandex.Radar analytics, its share of the Russian search market averaged 56.6% in Q3 2019, up from 55.9% in Q3 2018, but down a bit from 56.9% in Q2 2019. I was skeptical of Yandex reporting that, yes, indeed, we're No. 1, but a little research convinced me they were on the level.More recently, at the Morgan Stanley TMT Conference, Barcelona, Spain, November 14-15, 2019, Yandex reported its point-in-time share of the Russian search market as 57.2%.Source: Yandex Presentation Morgan Stanley TMT Conference, Barcelona, Spain, November 14-15, 2019Other Search and Portal offerings include Yandex.Disk with 10GB of free cloud storage, Yandex.News, the most-visited news aggregation site in Russia where, per the Yandex 2018 Form 20-F, the ""selection of news is fully automated and editorial-free,"" Yandex.Weather, real-time weather information and Yandex.Travel, an online travel and ticketing service.Yandex also has two consumer-oriented hardware products, Yandex.Station and Yandex.Phone. Yandex.Station, similar to Amazon's Echo, features Alice and is the first smart speaker designed for the Russian market. Yandex.Phone, an Android smartphone released in 2018, is also equipped with Alice.GRADE: A-Comment: Fighting off Google is an achievement - with a little help from good old Vlad - more on this later. Some of the ancillary services and products are doing well.Accounting for 15.1% of 2018 revenues, Taxi includes a ride-hailing business, a food delivery business and a self-driving car project. Launched in 2011, Yandex.Taxi is a fee-based ride-hailing business with operations in 17 countries. The business bulked up through the 2018 formation of a joint venture, MLU B.V., a Netherlands company, through which Yandex.Taxi effectively acquired the ride-hailing and food delivery businesses of Uber (NYSE:UBER) in Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Russia. Currently, Yandex owns a 58.2% controlling interest. The joint venture announced the strategic acquisition of Vezyot, Russia's largest taxi company, in July 2019. Yandex.Taxi maintains solo operations in Israel, the Ivory Coast, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Serbia, Uzbekistan, Finland, Estonia, Ghana, and Romania. The business model is more flexible than those of Uber or Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT), operating through taxi companies, licensed carriers and individual entrepreneurs under different regulatory requirements. According to Royal Bank of Canada's (NYSE:RY) analysis of data from the Analytical Center for the Government of the Russian Federation, the ""taxi"" industry is expected to grow by 5.6% to RUB 709 billion ($11.0 billion) in 2019 after growing at an 8.9% pace in 2018. Growth is expected to slow to the 3.7% to 4.0% range in 2020 and then stabilize with 2.0% growth per year in the long run.State-owned Sberbank (OTCPK:SBRCY) estimated that the size of the entire urban transportation market (taxi, carsharing, carpooling, etc.) could reach RUB 2.0 trillion by 2025, increasing at an average 15% annual rate from RUB 748 billion in 2018. In 2019, according to the Royal Bank of Canada study, taxi aggregators are projected to account for about 60% of the Russian taxi market, with Yandex.Taxi being the market leader with a 27% share. Vezyot, a recent Yandex acquisition target, accounts for 12% with Maksim at 9%, Gett at 5% and Citymobil at 1%.The numerous rumors of Yandex.Taxi pursuing an IPO were apparently correct as The New York Times reported on November 21, 2019, that Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and VTB Capital had been hired to prepare the business for an IPO.Why brave the Russian winter when you can have food delivered? There is an expanding market; according to Statista, the Russian online food delivery market will increase at a 12.6% annual growth rate from revenues of $1.9 billion in 2019 to $3.0 billion in 2023. The fee-for-service food delivery service, Yandex.Eats, was launched in February 2018. In a 2019 Deloitte CIS Center report, restaurant employee delivery accounted for 63% of the market; Delivery Club and Yandex.Eats followed at 31% and 26%, respectively. Yandex.Eats, available in 24 Russian cities, was formed through the combination of the December 2017 Foodfox acquisition with Uber.Eats. The service is known for its bright yellow uniforms.Source: Bloomberg.comCompetition is warming up, however, as Mail.ru (OTC:MLRYY) and Sberbank announced an agreement on November 19, 2019, to set up a 50-50% joint venture food delivery and taxi platform. Mail.ru will contribute its Delivery Club food delivery and Citymobil ridesharing businesses and Sberbank will contribute its 35% interest in Foodplex, an app for restaurant bookings. The partners plan to invest RUB 64.6 billion ($1 billion) in the new joint venture.All high-tech companies need an autonomous car project and Yandex has one, too. Launched in 2017, the project is now in real-world testing in Russia and Israel. The technology was recently on view at CES 2019 in Las Vegas.Source: wired.comAdding credibility to the project, Yandex and Hyundai Mobis, one of the world's largest automotive suppliers, announced an agreement on March 18, 2019, with the ultimate goal of creating a self-driving platform for sale to any car manufacturer or taxi fleet.GRADE: B+Comment: Execute the rumored IPO, perhaps retaining majority control while enhancing shareholder value. At $5 billion to $8 billion, the rumored IPO price range could be more than 50% of Yandex's market cap and should force a revaluation of the other segments. Until its fleet is autonomous, it's a low margin Uber/Traditional Taxi hybrid business inside a high margin tech company.Although accounting for only 1.3% of Yandex's 2018 revenue, e-commerce is growing rapidly in Russia from a low base. According to an article entitled ""Russian E-Commerce Market Grows by 26%"" in the September 3, 2019, edition of The Moscow Times:According to U.S. Department of Commerce website export.gov:Initially avoiding the Amazon business model, in 2000 Yandex launched Yandex.Market, a website connecting consumers and businesses with product information, price comparisons and user-generated product and retailer reviews. Although Yandex claims 17 million visitors use Yandex.Market every month to find and compare products, the platform has not experienced rapid growth. For example, between 2016 and 2017, revenues, based on a cost-per-click model, grew only 5.3%.Beginning in 2018, management began to address the slow growth of Yandex.Market. In April, Yandex sold Sberbank 45% for approximately $500.0 million to establish a joint venture. Along with an injection of capital, the sale also had an impact on financial reporting as Yandex.Market was deconsolidated and now reports as an equity investment.In October 2018, Yandex.Market moved closer to the Amazon business model, launching Beru (""I'll take it"" in Russian), a single platform online retailer with its own delivery and logistics. Revenues are derived from commissions and direct product sales. Beru struggled to gain market share during its first year of operations, ranking as the 52nd largest direct retail e-commerce site (as opposed to a marketplace) in Russia for the first half of 2019.In November 2018, Yandex.Market launched Bringly, a cross-border marketplace that offers Russian consumers imported products. Bringly is designed to compete with Chinese competitor AliExpress, the Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) online marketplace responsible for 69% of all online purchases in Russia. Bringly uses third-party fulfillment centers for order processing and is monetized on a commission basis.In June 2019, Yandex.Market announced a strategic alliance with China's e-commerce giant JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) to place its huge offering of consumer goods on both the Beru and Bringly platforms.Will these new product offerings and joint ventures re-energize Yandex's e-commerce operations? There have been growing pains. Articles have appeared in the business media about clashes between Yandex and Sberbank over a number of issues including Yandex.Market. In a July 28, 2019, article entitled ""Hopes of a 'Russian Amazon' Hit by Corporate Rift"" the Financial Times reported:Competitors have not been complacent. Wildberries, the largest home-grown direct e-commerce retailer in Russia with over $2 billion in annual sales, reported 73% revenue growth for the first half of 2019. In June 2019, Mail.ru, MegaFon [MSX:MEGAFON.ME], Alibaba and Russia's sovereign wealth fund RDIF announced the formation of a joint venture, AliExpress Russia JV, to build on the success of AliExpress by combining their relevant businesses in Russia and neighboring countries.There is enormous potential in Russian e-commerce and steps have been taken to reverse 20 years of modest results, but can Yandex and its quarrelsome partners develop significant, profitable e-commerce businesses?GRADE: C-Comment: Good idea, rather late. Partner troubles are not good for any business. Yandex should buy Wildberries - smart organic growth from the ground up.Accounting for about 2.9% of Yandex' 2018 revenue, the Classifieds division is one of the newer Yandex business initiatives. The core of the division is Auto.ru (e.g., Autotrader) that Yandex bought for about $175 million in 2014. In 2017, through a strategic partnership with Hearst Shkulev Digital (""HSD""), Yandex acquired HSD's local car classifieds sites across several Russian regions; E1.Auto (Yekaterinburg), Autochel.ru (Chelyabinsk), NGS.Auto (Novosibirsk) and Аuto.29.ru (Arkhangelsk), among others. These sites were merged with Auto.ru. Other ventures include Yandex.Realty, (e.g., Realtor.com), and Yandex.Jobs (e.g., Indeed.com). These services derive revenues from online advertising and listing fees. There is little information about market share for Classifieds.Although there is little information available about the Russian classifieds market, other players see opportunity. South African internet conglomerate Naspers (OTCPK:NAPRF) assumed 99%-control of Avito, Russia's leading online classifieds company, through a $1.16 billion investment in January 2019. Naspers initially bought a $1.2 billion stake in 2015. Through the six months ended September 30, 2018, Avito reported sales of 10.3 billion rubles or a 30% increase over the prior period with a 65.4% EBITDA margin and listings up 7.4% to 17.46 million.Comment: High margins, high return on investment, and room for growth.Media Services is another small piece of the Yandex pie, accounting for only 1.3% of 2018 revenue, but OTT services - streaming media services offered directly to viewers over the internet - are a very high-potential area. According to a September 11, 2019, article in IAA Telecom Daily, entitled ""Russian OTT Market Takes Off,"" legal online video services in Russia reported revenue of RUB 10.62 billion or $169.9 million for the first half of 2019. The forecast for total 2019 revenues is RUB 21.40 billion or $342.4 million, a 29.7% increase over RUB 16.495 billion or $263.9 million in 2018. Ivi was the market leader in revenue terms in the first half with a share of 26.4%, with second and third place Okko and YouTube claiming 14.2% and 12.3% respectively. By my calculations, Yandex came in tied at third with 12.3% of the market, a good showing considering its late entry.Management's long-term video strategy is the creation of a vertically integrated internet entertainment company; producing content, streaming and distributing TV, videos and theatrical releases - all centered on the Russian market. We've seen this strategy roll out in the U.S. with Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon's Prime and now Disney (NYSE:DIS) Plus - accompanied by a stratospheric valuation for NFLX.Yandex was slow to enter this market in force with major advances occurring in 2018. The first move was the acquisition of KinoPoisk (e.g., IMDb) in 2013, a website aggregating film reviews, industry news and user-generated comments. Video streaming capabilities were added in 2015. The site features more than 100 million movie ratings with three million new ones added per month. Revenue is generated by ads. KinoPoisk generated a certain amount of synergy with Yandex.Afisha, an online service that sells tickets to cinemas, theaters, and concerts.Yandex.TV Program, an online schedule of broadcast, cable and digital TV channels with an option to view a limited number of TV channels online, was a preliminary step toward all-inclusive streaming of live TV. Yandex extended its strategy to TV, movie and music production with Yandex.Studio, launched 1Q 2018 to create content, co-invest in the production of content and provide marketing support to movie releases. According to a February 6, 2019, article appearing in Daily Tech:In addition, Yandex announced that it would be producing a TV show called ""The Ministry"" for the 2019 -2020 season.In order to pull all the separate video-related services and sites together, Yandex launched Yandex.Live in July 2019 as the central smart portal integrating the company's existing video services. Users can watch live TV through Yandex.Live and view films from KinoPoisk, exclusive content from video influencers and live concerts and sports. An HDMI dongle allows users to stream Yandex.Live from their TVs. As the final piece, in 2Q 2018, Yandex began offering Yandex.Plus (e.g. Amazon Prime), a service providing subscribers with a bundle of multiple Yandex services, including unlimited music streaming on Yandex.Music, ad-free movies and TV-shows on KinoPoisk, discounts for taxi and car-sharing rides, free delivery for Beru customers as well as other benefits from the Yandex ecosystem. The service costs RUB 169 or about $2.75 per month.For audio consumers, Yandex offers Yandex.Music, a music streaming service (e.g., Spotify (NYSE:SPOT)) developed by Yandex. A free, limited service ad-supported version is available in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. With a subscription, Yandex.Music works anywhere in the world.While Yandex.Music has about 20 million active users, only about 2 million or 10% have paid subscriptions. Statista reports that the paid subscription Russian music streaming market will amount to only about $142.0 million in 2019 with a very slow projected 2.1% average annual growth rate from 2019 to 2023. Assuming an estimated cost of about $2.00 per subscription - difficult to assess with the advent of Yandex.Plus - Yandex.Music possibly maintains a market share of around 33% to 34% of the paid subscription Russian music market. As with online video, piracy is widely known to have limited growth in paid subscriptions. According to the previously cited ESET survey, 34% of respondents admitted to illegally acquiring their music.GRADE: A-Comment: Late start (again), but a sound strategy in a market that should show strong and accelerating growth.Other Bets and Experiments is an in-house business incubator for high-tech ventures. According to the Yandex 2018 Form 20-F, management uses this division to...Current major projects include:GRADE: A-Comment: Innovation and creativity are the future and management enshrined it here - a la Google.Yandex started trading on the NASDAQ in 2011 at an IPO price of $25 per share, about nine years after the company was incorporated as a standalone entity. When considering an investment, I expect 20-year old high-tech companies to report consistent and growing profits, especially those operating in volatile political environments. While income from operations has been in a steady uptrend, growing from RUB 9.5 billion in 2015 to RUB 20.8 billion in 2018, a 21.6% CAGR, net income has bounced around as dollar-denominated amounts held by Yandex have suffered swings in currency valuation.Looking at recent results, there's been strong, steady growth in Search and Portal revenues plus explosive revenue growth in everything else. This is Slide 8 from the Yandex 3Q 2019 Quarterly Supplementary Materials:Source: yandex.comAs the two tables (top and bottom) on the right show, Search and Portal pays the bills with consistent 20%-plus revenue growth and 45%-plus adjusted EBITDA margins. The explosive growth in revenues for the other segments has not been accompanied by explosive profitability, but most of the product lines in these segments are relatively new and not all strategies have been fully executed. In fact, it was not that long ago that management realized that Yandex could not be a one trick pony, notice the one number COO/CFO Greg Abovsky stresses in his boilerplate statement from the 3Q 2019 Press Release:Now, if only that 36% of revenues generated some profits…Yandex put up some big growth numbers YTD 3Q 2019. In the table below, the first green highlight, 39.3% revenue growth for the first three quarters compared to the prior period, was probably enough by itself to send the stock on its current run. Operating expenses, the first yellow highlight, increased 37.7%. Almost 50% of the increase in operating expenses was due to a RUB 14.1 billion or 58.6% increase in cost of revenues. RUB 4.7 billion or about 33.3% of this amount consisted of higher costs in the Taxi segment that management blamed on ""an increase of costs related to our corporate Taxi offering and the logistics costs related to food delivery."" In general, Taxi revenues are considered commissions when services are provided for individuals and reported as net revenue, but for corporate clients, Yandex acts as the principal in transactions and recognizes both revenues and cost of revenues on a gross basis. RUB 7.0 billion or about 50% of this amount was an increase in other costs of revenues, mainly reflecting costs related to Yandex.Drive, investments in Media Services content and IoT initiatives.Revenues are growing faster than expenses, resulting in our next green highlight, a nice RUB 6.4 billion or 48.0% pop in income from operations for YTD 3Q 2019 over YTD 3Q 2018. The difference in revenue and expense growth rates, however, declined from 3.9% for 2018 to 1.6% from YTD 3Q 2018 to 3Q 2019. Behemoth Alphabet, about twice the size in revenues, managed a 2.6% difference in growth rates for the same period in 2019.For some comparative perspective, consider the following table:Over the 2014-2018 period, Yandex had an advantage over both Alphabet and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) in revenue growth, but lagged Alphabet in operating income growth. More recently, however, comparing 3Q 2018 to 3Q 2019 as presented in the table above, Yandex crushed its much larger peers in growth in both revenues and income from operations. Yandex bulls should note that with even slightly better expense control income from operations would soar.The next green highlight, the RUB 28.2 billion impact of the Yandex.Market deconsolidation is directly related to the yellow highlight underneath. In 2018, Yandex sold 45% of Yandex.Market to Sberbank for RUB 30.0 billion, reporting a RUB 28.2 billion deconsolidation gain on sale and an increase in operating income as Yandex.Market's losses moved into other income where they contributed to the RUB 2.7 billion increase in losses from equity method investments. The impact of this joint venture was 1) to secure needed funding and a strong, but as we've seen, quarrelsome partner and 2) to improve Yandex's core operating income - a key focus for analysts and investors - at the expense of less transparent equity method investment income.Finally, the next three yellow marks highlight three numbers no one cared about; net income before taxes was down RUB 25.1 million or 56.3%, net income was down RUB 28.5 million or 70.6% and diluted EPS was down RUB 84.93 per share or 70.5%.Why did no one care? The Yandex.Market deconsolidation, rich and increasing share-based compensation expense and a blip up in the effective tax rate are masking the company's underlying profitability and earning power. We can get a better idea of what investors and the Street might be thinking if we adjust both YTD 3Q 2018 and YTD 3Q 2019 results:When we've placed both periods on a comparable basis adjusted income from operations increases to RUB 24.8 billion or 25.3% above the reported mark - and a RUB 8.3 billion or 50.4% increase over the comparable period adjusted number. Yandex begins to look like it merits a higher stock price.The first item to note is that adjusting for share-based compensation; RUB 4.9 billion YTD 3Q 2018 and RUB 7.1 billion YTD 3Q 2019, completely overwhelms the re-consolidation of Yandex.Market. For example, re-consolidating Yandex.Market penalizes YTD 3Q 2019 income from operations by only RUB 2.1 billion (about $35.1 million). Yandex's rather rich RUB 7.1 billion or $114.2 million share-based compensation expense was equal to 36.6% of YTD 3Q 2019 net income before taxes compared to 28.2% for Alphabet for the same period. Apparently, Russians make good capitalists after all.The impact on other income is all due to Yandex.Market, backing out the RUB 28.2 billion gain on the deconsolidation in 2018 and adding back the RUB 2.2 billion estimated loss from equity method accounting in 2019. The gain on sale and subsequent deconsolidation made period to period comparisons difficult and could be criticized as a bit of accounting sleight-of-hand, but I believe the joint venture was a good idea as building out an e-commerce ecosystem will 1) consume cash and 2) produce losses for a few years. As we've seen, however, perhaps another partner would have been more…congenial.When we put it all together as adjusted net income before taxes, RUB 19.5 billion YTD 3Q 2018 and RUB 26.6 billion YTD 3Q 2019, a RUB 7.2 billion or 36.7% increase, we can finally appreciate the true earning power of Yandex.Adjusting for a comparable tax rate, Yandex adjusted net income was up RUB 4.5 billion or 29.0% over the comparable period, as adjusted. That translates into an increase in adjusted diluted EPS of 29.4% - pretty sporty. And that's not all to consider…Valuation is a black art and valuation of internet companies is the darkest corner of that black art. Typical valuation ratios are uninformative for a company like Yandex. A few Seeking Alpha authors have tried sum-of-the-parts and DCF valuations. For Yandex, however, I prefer a combination with a DCF for the sizable, predictable cash flows of the Search and Portal segment folded into an overall sum-of-the parts valuation. As always there are caveats here; 1) net segment non-operating assets are assumed to be included in any sale, 2) operating leases are treated as debt per current orthodoxy, and 3) I made numerous broad assumptions only a team of overly caffeinated Ivy League MBAs could hope to track down for improved accuracy.I think the Search and Portal segment alone is worth about $45.73 per share - 77.5% of the total per share value of $59.02. Here's a simple way to bracket the per share values:At $41.95 per share on November 29, 2019, there's a 9.0% discount to the value of Search and Portal alone and a 40.7% discount to the total value of Yandex.On November 18 - a curious choice of date (see the following section on the ""Putin Put"") considering other announcements - the board authorized the buyback of up to $300 million worth of Class A shares. This is only about 2% of the market cap, but equates to half a year's average Yandex NASDAQ trading volume and should put upward pressure on the stock price.No discussion of a Russian company would be complete without at least a brief mention of the political reality. Vladimir Putin and his political affiliates, the United Russia party and the All-Russia People's Front, a coalition of parties and political organizations, control the government and major decisions in Russia. Yandex, however, is viewed as an important source for technological leadership and progress within Russia. It is extremely doubtful that Putin and his allies would do anything to seriously compromise the viability of the company, but they will maintain ultimate control.Source: en.kremlin.ruThe Russian government may regulate the company in ways that harm the interests of foreign shareholders, but there often appears to be an attempt to strike a balance between perceived national interests and open markets. Recent events demonstrate that the preferred modern method is to mask tightened control with bureaucracy.In July, Anton Gorelkin, a young Duma member of Putin's party, submitted a bill limiting foreign ownership of ""significant information resources"" to a maximum of 20%. Yandex shares dropped double digits in a day. The ""stick"" had been applied during a period when Yandex was in talks with the Russian government. Within weeks, the proposed limit had been raised to 49%, but the message had been sent to Yandex management.Then on November 18, Yandex announced ""targeted amendments"" to the company's corporate governance structure. The amendments resulted from negotiations in which Putin himself was rumored to have participated. The result was greater state control over Yandex, with the company agreeing to create a Public Interest Foundation (""PIF"") inheriting the Priority Share formerly wielded by Sberbank. The 11-member PIF board will include three members of Yandex management and 8 members drawn from government-controlled universities and other institutions. The PIF will have a veto over any share consolidations above 10% and the right to place two directors on the Yandex 12-person board. One of the PIF directors will have the right to nominate four directors to the Yandex board as a member of the board nominating committee. In effect, the government, through the PIF, will control 6 of the 12 Yandex directors. The two PIF directors will sit on a special public interest committee which will exert control over operational decisions involving 1) the sale or transfer of material intellectual property or Russian users' personal data to non-Russians, 2) changes to internal policies on protection of Russian users' personal data and 3) entry into agreements with a non-Russian state or international intergovernmental organization. The PIF will also be allowed to ""temporarily"" remove the Yandex CEO under ""certain exceptional circumstances.""Class A shareholders were given the right to approve certain transactions including any significant issuance of shares - possibly controlling dilution. Another point of contention was the 48% of Class B voting shares owned by Volozh. If Volozh should bump into a polonium-laden umbrella, instead of immediate conversion to Class A shares, his shares will be held by a family trust and not convert for two years. Mr. Volozh also agreed to a two-year lock-up of 95% of his Class B Shares. The ""reason"" provided was that the lock-up provided an ""additional layer of assurance"" of no abrupt change in the company's voting structure. One has to wonder what is expected to happen within two years.Surprise, surprise! After the amendments were announced, Gorelkin withdrew his proposed bill, tabling it until a later date.Sometimes, however, the Russian government puts its thumb on the scale in favor of Yandex. In 2017, Alphabet lost an antitrust case in Russia. Previously, when consumers bought an Android phone, the default search engine was Google - with no notification of any other options. As part of the settlement with Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service, Google created a choice window to allow users to select a default search engine upon first launch. When the choice window was introduced Google controlled about 60% of the Android phone search market, one year later in August 2018, Yandex announced that both companies now had an equal 49% of the market.Placing all this in perspective, Yandex corporate governance is surprisingly transparent.If you can tolerate the political risk, the heavy hand of the Russian government should not dissuade you from an investment in Yandex. Largely foreign institutions, for example, own roughly 80% of the Class A shares.There are many merits:There are several considerations and, unusually, none are financial:What to do now?To reiterate, I am typically a 3- to 5-year hold value-oriented investor, but I will be keeping my finger on the ""Sell"" trigger with this stock. Yandex is approaching its last high of $43.75 set March 8, 2018. The three-year chart below shows the broad trading range of the stock over the past three years.Data by YChartsToday's Yandex is not the Yandex of 2018, however, and I consider the stock a buy on 40% undervaluation at the current price. The catalysts that sent the stock on its recent run were the strong 3Q 2019 results combined with an acceptable end to the negotiations with the Russian government. The next catalyst to higher value is the Taxi IPO.What could go wrong? Postponement of the Taxi IPO, re-introduction of Gorelkin's bill or a similar one to the Duma, disappointing year-end results, perhaps more competition entering the market.I would urge re-evaluation at two points, $45 per share and $55 per share and, ceteris paribus, look to sell when, and if, the stock approaches what I consider fair value at $60 per share."
4265497,80285,2019-05-21T09:23:55-04:00,"Yandex's Search segment has been a fast-growing cash cow that accounts for the majority of its intrinsic value.However, key revenue growth drivers for the search business are starting to slow, and sustaining high long-term growth will be very challenging.Yandex search commands an impressive ecosystem that is able to acquire cheap traffic and monetize it effectively through its grip on local content.In the long run, Yandex's value is bounded by the income of the average consumer in the markets it serves, and this imposes a difficult constraint on its potential.Going forward, the growth and monetization of Mobile Search traffic and the add-on services (Cloud, Geolocation, Pages, etc.) will be key factors to watch for potential upside.","Yandex (YNDX) is one of the few local competitors that has managed to prevent Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from monopolizing the online search business in its country. Unlike in China, Google has been allowed to operate in Russia, but has not been able to outcompete local competitor Yandex, as the latter has consistently higher market share. This can largely be attributed to Yandex's tight grip on Russian-language search content, which gives them a strong connection with Russian-speaking consumers and local businesses.(Source: Yandex 20-F Reports)In the past two years, the company has diversified significantly into the ride-hailing business through a merger of Yandex.Taxi and Uber (NYSE:UBER) in 2017. I believe this should be viewed as a distinct part of the company that has yet to show significant synergies with its core product, and therefore, any valuation should ideally be on a sum-of-the-parts basis. This article will focus on assessing the value of Yandex's Search business and its future growth trajectory.Yandex Search primarily competes against Google and Mail.ru in the search space across the Desktop and Mobile channels, with the latter split into Android and iOS. Yandex has traditionally been much stronger in the Desktop space, with market share figures hovering around 68.5%, whilst maintaining a smaller but growing share in Android (51.6%) and iOS (48.1%). This is largely due to how Google is a ""default"" search engine for Android and iOS phones with greater prominence in the UI and factory-installed apps.(Source: Yandex disclosures. Market share figures are according to the last month in each quarter)As seen below, Search traffic is increasingly moving away from Desktop towards Mobile, with the latter becoming the main driver of revenue growth. Yandex needs to grow its mobile penetration and ecosystem (i.e. Cloud, Pages, Email, Geo-Services, etc.) to increase its value proposition towards Mobile users. Although I believe Yandex has a competitive ecosystem with a slew of offerings that can match up against Google's capabilities, gains are still likely to be slow due to the entrenched advantage that Google has, particularly on Android devices and other pre-installed apps on various phone models.(Source: Yandex disclosures)(Source: Yandex disclosures)Thus far, Yandex has shown significant improvements in Mobile market share by obtaining placements on OEM distribution deals with Huawei and other Asian brands, making continued improvements to their Search algorithm and improving the offerings within their ecosystem to attract more users. However, market share gains are slowing as it approaches 50%, largely as a function of Google's primacy in Android phones, and an inability to make significant inroads with iOS users. Therefore, any future market share increase for Mobile is likely to be marginal, although there is more room to improve monetization.Yandex's Search revenue is primarily a function of the total number of paid clicks multiplied by the average cost per click that advertisers are willing to pay. The chart below indicates that the majority of revenue growth has been driven by a rising number of paid clicks, which is largely a reflection of the number of internet users in Russia (plus Russian-speaking regions in Central Asia) and their browsing habits.(Source: Yandex Filings)Note that there tends to be an inverse relationship between growth in paid clicks and the cost per click (""CPC"") for two reasons: first, Yandex's revenue is ultimately constrained by advertisers' online budgets, which means a higher number of paid clicks is likely to cause a lower CPC in the short term; second, similar to AdWords, Yandex operates on an auction system where advertisers bid for ad placement for different keyword searches, which means a greater ""supply"" of paid clicks tends to drive CPC down assuming all else equal, as competition to purchase consumer attention is reduced.As seen above, when paid clicks increased significantly from FY2011 to FY2014, CPC growth was particularly anemic as an increase in the quantity of paid clicks tends to weaken CPC growth. Moreover, weak macro conditions in Russia resulted in low domestic consumption growth, which also contributed to this trend. This limited the ability of advertisers to increase their online ad budgets. These two factors largely account for the low CPC growth from FY2011 to FY2014.This framework reveals three important implications. First, growth in the number of paid clicks is ultimately bounded by the number of Internet users and their intensity of usage for Yandex Search. Second, advertiser budgets, particularly in Russia and CIS countries (which are typically sensitive to macroeconomic conditions), act as a constraint on Yandex's growth. Third, there is a short-term trade-off in Yandex's growth strategy between increasing the number of paid clicks, versus charging more for these clicks.Even though Yandex Search generates more sales for advertisers through click conversions over the long term, a consumption slowdown will still lead to an outsized decline in CPC since end-consumer demand is reduced as firms reduce costs. Hence, there is significant cyclicality to search revenue due to its impact on advertiser budgets and consumption, which is seen clearly when CPC declined by 14% from FY2008 to FY2009. This is particularly a concern for Yandex since it operates in a volatile macroeconomic environment, as Russia faces unique geopolitical and commodity-price risks, with ongoing sanctions and the majority of its exports being oil and other basic commodities. Hence, despite having an attractive business model with high margins and relatively fast growth, Yandex still deserves a relatively high discount rate, in line with Russia's elevated equity risk premiums.(Source: World Bank Data)Evaluating Yandex's growth prospects in Search, it becomes clear that a slowdown in the near future is very likely. Internet penetration in Russia is currently close to 80%, and forecasts reflect very slow incremental growth in internet users due to a stable population and access issues for older people living in more remote regions (which comprise the majority of its non-connected population). Hence, growth in the number of paid clicks is likely to slow, and future growth will primarily rely on increasing intensity of web searches per internet user. That said, Yandex could find new ways to further monetize existing users, as Google has done in mature markets, but even with these initiatives, we can expect that its glory days of 20-30% growth will not be repeated.Examining total revenue growth, we can disaggregate the dual impacts arising from an increasing number of internet users and usage intensity (i.e. converted search queries per user). This is because Yandex is paid based on the number of search queries that are ""converted"" into either consumer spending or an ad impression. Hence, I estimate usage intensity by taking total Search revenue growth minus the growth in Russia's internet users over the same periods. Seen below, revenue growth attributable to search queries per user has also fallen sharply in recent years, reflecting the fact that the majority of Russians already spend a significant portion of time on Yandex Search, which suggests that room for growth through more converted searches per user is limited. This is typically the natural trajectory as adoption of search engines approaches a peak (Google's growth in mature markets is a good example of this).(Source: Yandex Filings, Author's Work)Hence, an analysis of both these drivers reveal that growth in paid clicks will likely to decrease in the future, and CPC growth is significantly constrained by a generally weak macro environment in Russia due to structural and geopolitical problems. These include a slew of existing sanctions, its chronic dependence on oil prices, and the concentration of economic resources among oligarchic industries. Putting these facts together, I believe Search revenue growth is likely to moderate lower in the next few years, and I derive a reasonable forecast of this scenario below.(Source: Author's Work)The slowing growth rate suggests that the Search segment should be valued on increasingly lower multiples as a stand-alone business. Taking the book value of Yandex.Taxi of $4.33bn and backing out Yandex's stake of 59.3% (Uber holds a 36.6% stake, with the remaining 4.4% held by employees), I arrive at a residual market capitalization of US$7.49bn, which implies a 4.46x P/S ratio, although there have been reports that Yandex may seek a valuation of up to $6bn for an IPO of its Taxi segment. However, given the poor post-IPO performance of Uber and Lyft (LYFT), it would be more appropriate to value the business conservatively at the book value, which was derived from a valuation exercise done in July 2017 when Yandex.Taxi and Uber merged their operations in Russia and some neighboring markets.Given that other ancillary segment revenue can generally be attributed to intersegment revenue and is largely trivial to total profitability, we take it that the entire US$7.49bn is attributed to the value of Yandex's Search business. Using margins prior to the growth of Yandex.Taxi which began to ramp up in FY2014, we observe that the Search business can sustain a gross margin of ~80% and operating margins of around ~30%, which is fairly similar to the profitability of Google's Search business in its early days prior to the agglomeration of other segments that changed its margin profile. This suggests that the margins are appropriate for estimating Yandex's Search profits on a stand-alone basis.Taking a 30% operating margin, I estimate that Yandex generated a net profit RUB $26bn from its Search and related businesses in FY2018, implying a trailing P/E of 18.7 times for Yandex Search. Looking ahead, I project FY2019 net profit from Search business at RUB $30.4bn, which implies a 1-year forward P/E of 15.9 times. This is based on a 20% corporate tax rate assumption, with growth rates taken from the chart above. Based on the projected growth rate for FY19/20, this is a very reasonable valuation for Search as it implies a PEG ratio of 1 or less and may signal large upside if the company can execute on Mobile and monetize its ecosystem, assuming the valuation for its Taxi business remains stable.  Moreover, their strong performance in Search market share for the past two quarters may signal greater upside if they continue executing in the Mobile Search space.With slowing growth in its Desktop Search traffic, Yandex will increasingly rely on its performance in Mobile to drive growth. Despite having favorable characteristics as a Search engine business, it seems appropriately valued at a PEG ratio of approx. 1, particularly as it faces structural constraints due to the macro environment it operates in. Whilst the facts suggest that growth from internet penetration and search queries per user are likely to taper off, Yandex could conceivably find ways to monetize other parts of its ecosystem, such as Cloud, Geo-Located Ads, and others.However, it is too soon to judge whether these efforts will lead to meaningful revenue growth, particularly since we are unable to break out revenue for these add-on products within the ecosystem. Management has promised more granular disclosures going forward and has reorganized the geolocation services under the Other Bets and Experiments segment instead of staying in the Search segment in Q1. Their reasoning is that the Geolocation business is growing rapidly and may distort Search's financial results if they continued to operate under a single segment. The performance of these ancillary services will be crucial determining whether revenue growth can be sustained as Yandex attempts to monetize users in other ways as Desktop Search revenue growth declines."

        Yandex’ valuation is very attractive.
        We are rated strong buy on Yandex.","Yandex (YNDX) is a very unique company which we strongly encourage investors to buy. We are very bullish on the future of Russian internet and see Yandex as the key winner of the industry given its monopolistic operations. We are particularly attracted by the valuation.On 7/26, Yandex announced another stellar quarter beating Interfax consensus revenue and EBITDA and raised guidance.Revenue grew 41% YoY (excluding Yandex.Market which was deconsolidated) beating consensus by 2%. The quarter also included a revenue growth guidance range increase to 32%-36% from the earlier 30%-34%. Yandex blew through the EBITDA consensus estimate by 8% with 50% YoY growth, reporting a RUB 13.1 bn EBITDA pushing the EBITDA margin to 31.6%. Even as the dominant player, Yandex managed to grow its online advertising revenue 21% and number of taxi rides 49% YoY.The quarter was marked by impressive performance in the taxi vertical. After posting large losses in previous years, the vertical turned positive for the first time in almost 4 years. This is particularly impressive given that this segment includes large investments in core taxi operations as well as in food delivery and autonomous driving.The market had, what appeared to be, a confused reaction the news. The stock initially traded up ~5% before ending the day down 3.6%.Source: FinvizRussian economy, like in the rest of the world, is moving online. More and more companies are utilizing e-commerce, and online service offerings are increasing by the day. The recent history of the shift in developed markets are good proxies for what is to come in emerging ones like Russia. E-commerce, despite its size, is at the beginning of its growth phase and is showing accelerating adoption. This is creating both a larger audience for retailers and new gigantic industries like online ad sales. Internet of transportation is creating the nascent industry of ride hailing. With these trends young even in developed markets, there are massive opportunities in emerging ones.Source: US Census BureauWhile these industries are divided up among many players in the west, in Russia the same name comes up as the leader in each. Yandex has 55% market share in Russia’s online search market, and is the leader in ride hailing with Yandex.Taxi (operations merged with Uber (UBER) last year), is the leader in e-commerce with Yandex.Market, and is the leader in Moscow autos classifieds with Auto.ru. Yandex is everywhere in Russian internet, and is continuously adding verticals where they see growth.Yandex’ monopolistic exposure to Russian internet, particularly given how Russia has high penetration rates of internet (80%) and smartphones (66%) and low penetration of e-commerce (3%), is very interesting and should be highly value generative going forward.Not many companies manage to balance high growth rates (+30% 3 year revenue CAGR) with attractive financials nowadays. Yandex has excellent margins of 70% gross, 26% EBITDA, and 13% net for the TTM. Yandex’ operations are robust cash generators, yielding positive free cash flow since 2011. The cash generation protects investors from dilution and is the backbone of the solid balance sheet with more than $1.1 bn net cash sitting on it. The financials are a dream for any company.The valuation is very modest given the growth prospects. Yandex is trading at 28x forward non-GAAP P/E, 18x forward EBITDA, and 17x forward cash flow. This is for an operation that is expected to keep up its proven track record of growth and turn exponentially more profitable.We strongly recommend investors buy the monopoly with the attractive business model dominating a growth industry at today’s valuation. We expect price appreciation both due to organic growth and to multiple expansion.Source: Seeking AlphaIn our view, main risk facing Yandex is regulatory. Operating in Russia isn’t easy and tides could change quickly. Currently, we like Yandex’ apolitical standing and see no immediate risk. But the company does operate in sensitive sectors and could come under scrutiny.Greater competition could hurt the growth profile. Google or any other major competitor prioritizing the Russian market and investing aggressively might take Yandex market share."

Yandex manages to keep revenue growth at 40% for four quarters in a row, which is a spectacular result. Yandex.Taxi for the first time reached a positive operational efficiency, demonstrating EBITDA at 423 million rubles and revenue growth of 117%. The latest news about Yandex is worth considering in more detail since they can say a lot about the company's future prospects.Last Friday Anton Gorelkin, a member of the State Duma Committee on Information Policy, Information Technologies and Communications submitted a bill that introduces the concept of ""significant information resources"" and limits the share of foreign participation in them. Gorelkin told Interfax that the bill would affect, in particular, Yandex and Mail.ru Group.The draft law proposes that a site or service that is actively used by Russians should be considered as a “significant information resource”. The decision to assign the status of a “significant information resource” should be made by a government commission on the proposal of Roskomnadzor.According to the document, the main owner of such a resource may be a Russian company or a citizen of the Russian Federation; the share of foreign participation may not exceed 20%. If this requirement is violated, the authorities will be able to prohibit any advertisements about the information resource and any advertisements published in it.Along with this, Deputy Prime Minister Maxim Akimov criticized the draft law, calling it destructive and redundant in the context of regulating the Russian internet. This indicates that the law is not a result of a general consensus between different political groups, though it's difficult to say whether this law is coordinated directly with the Kremlin.Why this law is so bad for Yandex? If we look at the ownership structure of the company, it becomes evident that Yandex is one of the most vulnerable companies in Russia to possible shareholder structure overhaul.Source: CNN BusinessAll the top-10 shareholders of Yandex are foreign and own more than 30% of the company in total. If we also add mutual funds ownership share, non-Russian entities own more than 43% of Yandex. That said, cutting foreign participation to 20% would be absolutely disastrous for the company. Even though the law won't be adopted in its initial form, I see two main versions who could benefit from the introduction of this law. 1. Herman Gref Wants Yandex To Become More AgreeableShortly before the bill was submitted, Sberbank started a joint venture with Mail.Ru while having a JV with Yandex. In turn, the joint business of Sberbank and Yandex seems going through hard times. According to FT, relations between the partners have deteriorated after Yandex CEO Arkady Volozh declined the offer to transfer control to Sberbank last fall, which was widely rumored. Presumably, Sberbank CEO Herman Gref unsuccessfully attempted to gain more influence in Yandex to promote initiatives that are lucrative for Sberbank within the joint venture. Interestingly, a few days after these rumors appeared, the same Mr. Gorelkin introduced a bill limiting foreign ownership of news aggregators headed by Yandex.News. This draft law passed the first reading in the State Duma, though I couldn't find any more news about the law since that time. Actually, the participation of Mr. Gorelkin in both laws soon after something happened between Yandex and Sberbank seems really suspicious. As a result of Sberbank’s deal with Mail.Ru Group, Yandex’s main competitor get an almost unlimited source of funding: Sberbank will invest huge amounts of money in Citymobil taxi service and food delivery platform Delivery Club - more than 51 billion rubles. In total partners are going to invest 64 billion rubles in the joint venture. For comparison, the total revenue of the Yandex Taxi amounted to 19.2 billion rubles in 2018. This year it is expected to double, but no more than that - in the first half of 2019, Taxi's revenue grew by 129% and amounted to 16.4 billion rubles. Now Yandex will have to sacrifice either profit or market share. Having received billions from Sberbank, Citymobil will likely start a price war. In the Moscow taxi market, Yandex.Taxi holds 56.5%, Citymobil - 24.5% as of early 2019, so the price war may take a while.Apparently, having a joint venture both with Yandex and Mail.Ru, Herman Gref plans to explicitly blackmail Yandex until the joint venture reaches the level of integration that will be most beneficial for Sberbank. For Yandex, it looks like pure zugzwang, as the company will suffer losses both from resistance to Sberbank and from further cooperation on the terms of Sberbank. In addition to this, all sorts of restrictive bills will serve as a constant reminder of the need to cooperate with Sberbank on its terms.2. Yandex May Become A State Corporation SoonThe Russian investment firm Renaissance Capital provided an interesting view of the situation around Yandex. The firm's analysts suggest that Yandex may soon become a state corporation. In this regard, the recent draft law is considered as a tactical move to put Yandex under pressure before the upcoming negotiations which are expected to be held in the next two months. Analysts note that Gazprom, Sberbank, VTB and Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) may get to be a Yandex state shareholder. At the same time, Herman Gref opposes the transfer of Yandex to state control bypassing Sberbank, but Renaissance Capital believes that he will not be able to use a ""golden share"" owned by Sberbank to block the transfer, as this ""golden share"" was initially intended to protect Yandex from full foreign ownership.Frankly, this sounds a bit ridiculous, as this version heavily relies on the sole fact that the Russian authorities are strongly concerned about too high foreign ownership in Yandex and pushes aside Sberbank, a big player in the Russian market which can't be simply ignored. I'd take both versions mentioned in the article with a grain or even a bag of salt, but if one of them is at least partially true, then what is happening fits into the generally accepted practices of resolving business conflicts in Russia, namely, using all possible connections among political and business elites to impose one's will on a rival. For investors, this does not bode well, and given the increased risks, the company is hardly suitable for investing in the long-term perspective, in my opinion. Yandex shares crashed down three times in the past 12 months, and the current stock price has not changed much since Yandex’s IPO in 2011 (vs +124% S&P 500 gains for the same period). However, high volatility can be useful for short-term speculations, so if you want to try your luck, then Yandex is the stock for you."

Over time, these new assets should drive the majority of the company's total revenues, with less reliance on its search engine business.The recent shares' pullback - a decline of 9% last month - which is attributable to the proposed regulatory measures to limit foreign ownership in Russian tech companies, provides a window of opportunity to accumulate shares.A sum-of-the-parts valuation implies a value of $58, implying a significant 61% upside from current levels. Investors buying Yandex shares at current prices are essentially getting Yandex Taxi and other assets for free.Founded in October 2011, Yandex Taxi is a technology company that operates a ride-hailing and food technology business in more than 300 cities across Russia, CIS, Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.In July 2017, the company signed an agreement with Uber to merge their business and operations in Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, and Russia. The company chipped in $100 million, while Uber added $225 million in the new structure. It also went into the food delivery business with the acquisition of Foodfox in December 2017.Yandex's 2Q 2019 financial results underscore the importance of Yandex Taxi's business to the Group's financial performance. Segment-wise, its revenues increased by 117% YoY to RUB 8.8 billion and accounted for 21% of the total Group revenues. For the first time, the segment reported a positive EBITDA of RUB 423 million, or a 5% EBITDA margin, driven by robust performance of the ride-hailing business in Russia, offsetting the losses from international operations and the investments in food technology and autonomous driving technology.Last month, the company disclosed that it acquired the IP and call-centers of the Vezet Taxi Group in Russia for a combination of shares in Yandex Taxi and $71.5 million cash. The transaction will be finalized by the end of 2019, subject to the approval of the Russian Anti-monopoly Service.We see the acquisition as a game-changer for Yandex Taxi for the following reasons:The food delivery business within Yandex Taxi is a different story. While the further inflow of capital into the food delivery space will help grow the market, the incumbents, including Yandex, is likely to maintain current investment levels. However, improving cash flows from the ride-hailing business will help fund the food delivery unit.Part of the reason Yandex is valued a pure-play search engine company is that other businesses such as Yandex Taxi et al. have not provided sustainable cash flow generation. It is understandable - Yandex remains entrenched in its core business, cornering 57% share of the Russian search engine market. The company's search business showed improving trends, highlighting growth of circa 20% for the year.The continued dominance of Yandex in the Russian search engine space may have led the market to miss the growth story beyond search. This misperception is likely to be corrected soon as Yandex Taxi is planning to pursue an initial public offering in the next two years. Whereas a potential IPO could also provide investors with a good monetization opportunity, I think it will unlock Yandex Taxi's underlying value as it would provide more clarity on the segment's future growth plans.Yandex has made considerable progress in the self-driving car segment following its development in 2017. In just two years, the company has provided visible results as it created prototype autos and launched an autonomous ride-hailing service through Yandex Taxi. In March of this year, a Hyundai Motor Group unit and Yandex N.V. signed an agreement to jointly develop autonomous vehicles based on Hyundai models. Last year, the company was also in talks with Renault SA (OTC:RNSDF) to explore the possibility of autonomous driving features in Renault's locally-made vehicles. The company is expected to operate 100+ Level 4 cars by the end of this year and might pursue commercialization in 2022.This project represents a significant opportunity for Yandex N.V. on a global scale, where they could sell licenses for self-driving technology and further monetization opportunities through advertising and media services. Overall, this should provide incremental cash flows for Yandex that may be utilized to fund further growth.My Yandex valuation is derived using a sum-of-the-parts of Yandex N.V. business. I calculate the value of the core search operations using a discounted cash flow approach while employing a multiple-based valuation for other Yandex businesses.The sum-of-the-parts method yields a value of $58.30 per share, an upside of 61.3% from current levels, as summarized below:At current prices, the market has valued only the core search business, and largely discounted the other Yandex assets. However, a potential IPO of Yandex Taxi could be the key catalyst in driving a re-rating of the stock. Finally, there is a lot of optionality in its other ventures, e.g., its autonomous vehicle segment, to which the market is giving little credit. Based on an evaluation of Yandex's sum-of-parts, I believe Yandex has a further 61.3% upside from here."
4253177,101693,2019-04-07T16:20:20-04:00,"Yandex offers investors excellent exposure to tech and international markets. This can be a plus for those building a portfolio based on those parameters.The company has competitive advantages (political and intrinsic) that should allow it to retain and expand its Russian market share.Yandex owns many subsidiaries and business segments. However, the main ones are search and taxi. These two comprise over 95% of total revenues.Search is YNDX's core and is growing at double digits while producing profits at approximately 15% margins. Taxi grows at triple digits, but isn't profitable. This will eventually hurt YNDX's profitability.My valuation model uses a steep discount rate to account for the inherent risks of Russian stocks and worsening profit margins. My model suggests a fair value of $22.76 per share.","Yandex (NASDAQ: YNDX) looks like a fantastic company on paper. It is often regarded as the Russian Google because it has roughly the same search capabilities as Alphabet's (GOOG/GOOGL) Google but tailored for the Russian market. This makes the stock an exciting opportunity for investors seeking exposure to emerging markets and tech. However, it's important for investors to realize that Yandex is not without its risks. Currency fluctuations and being at the mercy of the Russian government make it a highly speculative play. Moreover, Yandex.Taxi might not prove profitable down the road and could hamper YNDX's overall results. In my view, Yandex is a viable investment, but at a much steeper discount.YNDX's core business is its search engine and portal. The company has better search results for the Russian language than Google, which gives it a natural advantage. After all, Cyrillic is entirely different from English or other Latin languages. YNDX builds on this by expanding into other market niches. For example, YNDX also has interests in e-commerce, classifieds, media services, and virtual assistants, to name a few. All of these businesses complement YNDX's core segment very nicely.Source: Yandex and Google logos. Both companies are very similar in search capabilities. However, Yandex has the upper hand for searches in Russian.However, unlike Google, Yandex doesn't have to compete with a Russian Amazon (AMZN) or a Russian Uber (UBER). This is why Yandex can tap into all of these market niches practically uncontested. So from a competitive point of view, YNDX's business prospects look promising and reliable for years to come.Another cool characteristic about YNDX is that it has a considerable geopolitical moat around it. Big tech companies can have a lot of influence and data on citizens, and thus companies like Google or Yandex are naturally valuable assets for world powers. This is why I believe the Russian government likely prefers to maintain Yandex's leadership in the Russian market. After all, Russia has strategic interests in keeping its citizens’ data under control. This also allows Russia to keep its country's internet gateway under closer surveillance. Thus, it's evident that the Russian government likely favors Yandex over Google.Image source: The Moscow Times. Yandex is betting heavily on transport as a service, but will it be profitable in the end?Furthermore, many Russians have Yandex as their home page (over 60% of Russians), and they start their days with it. It is no wonder that Yandex keeps gaining market share in Russia. I don't see this trend reversing anytime soon. If anything, Yandex should continue to increase market share in Russia and should eventually become the undisputed leader there.Yandex grows its revenues at an average of roughly 20% to 25% per year. Still, its costs don't increase as fast as its revenues for the most part. This is probably because Yandex is a tech company, but also because of its competitive advantages in Russia.Source: Yandex’s earnings slides. The company's margins fluctuate from quarter to quarter, but overall they seem to be around 15%. With this figure, we can estimate the stock's earnings power going forward.These margins are healthy, but they might not be sustainable over the long term. Yandex could experience margin contraction due to revenue growth from Yandex.Taxi (more on that later). However, overall, YNDX's core segment (search) seems like a safe bet for now. Also, Yandex is betting on new technology trends that could pay off in the future. So putting it all together, Yandex looks solid for the foreseeable future.Source: Yandex 2018 full year results. Yandex.Market is still not a material part of the business. This is the ""Amazon"" part of the company and it's a joint venture with Sberbank, which is a state-owned Russian bank. Yandex’s prospects will remain promising as long as it has the government’s blessing.As you can see, ""search and portal"" (the Google-like segment of YNDX) comprises the majority of the company's revenues. This segment accounts for roughly 80% of total revenues. The runner-up segment is ""Taxi,"" which is the merger between Uber and Yandex for Russia (approximately 60% owned by YNDX). This segment is about 18% of total revenues, but it’s growing at an outstanding 216% YoY.As a side note, the fact that Uber had to merge with Yandex to play in Russia speaks volumes about Yandex’s proximity to the government.At any rate, I think investors should focus mainly on YNDX’s core (search) and Yandex.Taxi when valuing the business. These two segments account for over 95% of the company’s revenues. These two combined should allow YNDX to grow at a 25%+ CAGR over the next five years.However, as I previously mentioned, it’s not clear whether or not the 15% margins will remain stable. The recent Lyft (LYFT) IPO shows that transportation as a service isn’t as profitable as initially expected, and won’t be for the foreseeable future. Thus, as Yandex.Taxi grows, margins might deteriorate. At this point, it’s too early to tell.At a glance, it looks like Yandex is trading at a modest PE ratio of roughly 17. However, once you look deeper into it, it isn't necessarily that cheap. Yandex's top line grows at 28.29% year over year. Naturally, this is an outstanding rate of growth. Still, the question is what does this mean in terms of earnings power for the stock.Source: Yandex’s earnings slides. As long as taxi remains unprofitable, Yandex's margins will continue to deteriorate. Investors are betting on Yandex being able to turn a profit on transport as a service, but this won't be easy.Here is where it gets tricky. In roughly five years, the company should be producing almost $635 million in yearly net income. This growth is relatively reasonable given that the company enjoys a favorable position in Russia and secular tailwinds. However, there are two problems here: 1) is it reasonable to expect that the 15% margins will remain while growing Yandex.Taxi? 2) At what multiple do we price those earnings?First of all, I believe it’s very likely that margins will deteriorate as Yandex.Taxi continues to expand. This punishes the company's valuation because it slows down earnings growth even though the top line continues to grow at a faster pace.In terms of its valuation, let’s assume a revenue CAGR of 30% per year. Also, suppose margins keep shrinking from 15% down to 10% year by year due to Yandex.Taxi's unprofitable growth. This will cause profitability to contract due to the expansion of Yandex.Taxi.The wild card is that maybe Yandex finds a way to offer transport as a service at a profit before 2023. This would change the company’s valuation dramatically and offer substantial upside for investors. However, this doesn’t seem very likely at this point. Nevertheless, we can assume a PEG ratio of 1 (which is a good rule of thumb for fair value). This would imply a 23.37 PE ratio for the company (based on the CAGR of YNDX’s profits on my forecast).This would result in a valuation of approximately $44 per share by 2023. This valuation can be discounted back into the present at the required rate of return of your choosing.Source: Bloomberg. When you invest in Yandex, you expose yourself to substantial currency risks because results are reported in USD but received in RUB.In my view, Russia is a very complicated market. Any business operating there is at the whims of the government. In fact, there’s always the risk of nationalization for Yandex. It's unclear how investors would fare under such an event. Furthermore, Russian companies have substantial currency risks due to the RUB and USD exchange rate volatility.These factors alone should require a considerable rate of return to justify an investment. To keep it simple, say we assume a 15% RRR given these risk factors.Worsening margins due to the fast expansion of the unprofitable Taxi segment hurt YNDX's valuation considerably. The main hope for investors is to rely on a P/S valuation. However, this will not attract value investors anytime soon.In my opinion, YNDX's valuation isn't very attractive at the current price levels. I must note that I did use somewhat conservative inputs. However, regardless of how you see it, it is clear that the company isn't undervalued right now. Unfortunately, as much as I like YNDX’s business itself, Russian investments require a deep discount to justify their inherent risks. Thus, it looks like Yandex doesn’t adequately compensate investors at current prices.No asset is worth an infinite price. According to my analysis, the company is overvalued, or at best fairly valued (depending on how high your RRR is). If you want to achieve alpha, you should wait to invest in Yandex at a much lower price. In my view, $20-$25 per share makes sense. Only then Yandex starts to become much more attractive. I'm not predicting that YNDX will ever reach that valuation, but if it does, it'll present an excellent opportunity for investors (assuming nothing fundamental has changed). After all, investing is a game of patience. So I think it’s best to wait for a good entry on this one.Thank you for reading and good luck."
4229222,104809,2018-12-19T11:52:13-05:00,"Core business in search and portal is see over 20% revenue growth as it cements its market leader position.Current high growth stage will be powered by its increasingly diversified revenue drivers including its taxi-hailing, e-commerce and cloud businesses.Can Yandex establish market leading position in these new business segments?","With Yandex (NASDAQ: YNDX) about 37% off its 52 week highs under the broader context of a 32% fall in the Moscow Exchange Index (MOEX), I would like to do a deep dive on whether Yandex can now be considered a value pick.Yandex is commonly known as the Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) of Russia and like Google, its main business lies in Online Advertising through its Search portal. As of its most recent Quarter, its share of the Russian search market is an industry leading 55.9% and it contributed to 90% of total revenue as of FY2017.However what has gotten management and other investors excited is the huge growth potential of its other increasingly diverse revenue drivers. Management has confidently stated that ""the last time we were growing this quickly was in 2012 when we were one quarter of the size we are today.”This article will be the first in a Yandex series and will be focused on a thorough exploration on Yandex's different revenue drivers and its future outlook in terms of revenue growth and margins.A later article will look at the valuation of Yandex through a DCF and comparative valuation to determine if Yandex is undervalued at current prices. It will also examine the risks inherent in investing in a Russian stock by looking at the near term Russian macro outlook.Overview of Yandex's businesses The diversification of Yandex and its success has it on the path to becoming a Russian super app. This is best illustrated in a recent BBC article, ""Yandex has gone way beyond search; it now operates in the arena of machine translation, it can sell and deliver stuff to you, it can serve you food, call you a cab, be your home cinema, help you educate yourself and catch your train. It is starting to involve itself into almost every aspect of life.”Beyond its dominant position in its search and portal business, there are three other areas in which I am particularly excited about - its taxi hailing, e-commerce and cloud business. This has allowed Yandex to enjoy more than 30% revenue growth thus far in FY2018 and more than 25% revenue growth in the previous 2 years. I am bullish that Yandex can establish dominant positions in these high growth industries in Russia, funded by its incredibly profitable search and portal business.Search and Portal (Online Advertising)The search and portal business in Russia has long been a duopoly between Yandex and Google with jockeying for market leading position. However, since October 2017, Yandex has separated itself from Google and it has captured a 54-56% of market share while Google has remained in second place at around 43% of market share. Yandex's success can be directly attributed to its successful lawsuit against Google and its anticompetitive requirement of pre-installation of its search services on mobile devices running on Android in Russia.It has since remained relatively stable at 54-56% in 2018 which makes it unlikely that it will continue to increase market share significantly. However, maintaining a 55% market share on a rapidly expanding industry still entails continued growth significant growth, Q3 revenue increased 26% YoY. Yandex’s understanding of the local environment and Russian language (complex grammar rules) has given it an advantage over Google. These advantages have allowed Yandex to consistently increase its cost-per-click and the number of advertisers that advertise with Yandex. Yandex has also continued to innovate and ensure that its platform remains attractive to investors. In its recent earnings report, management spoke of experimentation with ad layouts by rolling out new templates targeted at Mobile and in some cases, there was a 3.5x increase in the share of mobile paid links.Source: StatCounterYandex is also riding an industry wide tailwind that is benefitting from a young Russian population (45% of the population are under the age of 35) with high mobile penetration rates that will see continued use of Yandex services. Furthermore, the costs of mobile data usage is significantly lower in Russia. According to multicountry benchmarks, 500 MB of mobile data in Russia costs 9% of American costs, 15% of France, 42% of South Africa and 75% of Philippines. Mobile usage has powered the increasing popularity of Yandex where smartphone use of Yandex increased exponentially from 20% to 44.1% of total Yandex use from Oct 2015 to Oct 2018. According to a report commissioned by the Russian Association for Electronic Communications, mobile penetration in Russia has increased 12% per annum in the past 5 years and will continue to see similar increases.Furthermore, global online advertising revenue looks set to continue to enjoy double digit growth rates according to eMarketer's forecast. This should bode well for Yandex as the market leader in Russia which should enjoy higher growth rates due to the relative immaturity of the Russian online advertising industry. For example, eMarketer has forecasted 17.7% global increase in online advertising spending for 2018, this is below Yandex's own guidance of 22-24% for its search and portal business.Search and portal revenue will also be driven by Yandex's continued expansion into the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) which consists of 10 former Soviet Republics. It currently offers a broad range of services in Belarus, Kazakhstan and Turkey.Management has also stated that search and portal revenue growth will fall within the 22-24% YoY range. I am thus projecting a 5 year CAGR of about 17%. 5 year CAGR is lower than the current FY18 revenue growth as projected by management ""due to continuing macroeconomic challenges, increasing competition, evolution of overall online advertising market."" There will also be downward pressure on operating margins as a result of increased CapEx in expanding data centers to support growth in existing markets as well as new markets.My 5 year CAGR estimates are conservative given the global trend of increasing spending on online advertising of which Yandex is best suited to take advantage of in Russia and the CIS areas. Furthermore, Alphabet has consistently managed to achieve over 20% revenue growth for its search and portal business over the last few years despite being a significantly more mature company.Taxi-hailing Business (Yandex.Taxi)Yandex.Taxi's taxi hailing business currently makes up about 5% of total revenues but has more than doubled its revenue over the past 2 years. Furthermore, its prospects as Yandex's new revenue driver looks incredibly promising due to current inefficiencies of the local taxi services and its merger with Uber in Russia and the CIS region. Its taxi hailing business is different from Uber's globally famous ride sharing business.Uber and Yandex Taxi merged their ride sharing and food delivery business in Russia and the CIS region which includes 127 cities. Prior to the merger, Yandex Taxi and Uber were engaged in a cut-throat price war in order to gain market share which resulted in significant EBITDA losses of -3,168 million rubles in Q3 FY17 (EBITDA losses are -711 million rubles in Q3 FY18). Since the merger, Yandex Taxi saw a 344% YoY increase in revenue during Q3 FY18 and a 25.7% QoQ increase. This is a great reflection of the explosive growth that Yandex Taxi has enjoyed and will continue to enjoy in the short term.Its explosive growth is also a result of its continued expansion throughout Russia and 12 other countries including Finland, Belarus, Georgie, Serbia and Lithuania. Yandex and Uber combined operations in 127 cities but during a short span of time, it has expanded its operations to more than 600 cities. According to the map by SimilarWeb, Uber is the dominant force in 108 of 171 countries in 2016. However, just as Grab and Didi has established itself as the dominant force in Southeast Asia and China respectively, it is clear that Yandex Taxi is King in Russia and the surrounding CIS regions.Source: SimilarWebThe long runway for Yandex Taxi can be seen in its Q3 FY18 revenue at 5,109 million rubles (USD75.2 million) which pales in comparison to Uber's gross bookings of USD12 billion in Q2 FY2018. Even considering Yandex Taxi's smaller geographical presence, it is clear that Yandex Taxi is still in the beginning of its growth and it will enjoy high revenue growth for the considerable future.Beyond contributing to top line growth, Yandex Taxi's burden on the bottom line should lessen over the next few years. As previously mentioned, they are no longer engaged in a price war with Uber and should stand to gain from cost savings synergy. Even more encouragingly, in its Q3 earnings call, management stated that “the Taxi business for Russia and CIS is profitable on EBITDA basis and you can assume that it's even more profitable if you just take Russia proper excluding CIS.” The EBITDA loss of -711 million rubles in Q3 FY18 should instead be attributed to continued investments in other loss-making segments within the Taxi division such as food delivery and autonomous driving.Beyond its taxi hailing business, its revenue growth is also being driven by its foray into the food delivery business which it entered after its acquisition of Partiya Edy and Foodfox. Partiya Edy currently only generates about 200 million rubles in turnover (around USD3 million) but it should increase significantly after its integration with Yandex.Taxi and continued expansion beyond Moscow and St.Petersburg. Foodfox recently launched in 2016 but has since partnered with more than 1,0000 restaurants in Moscow. Yandex also controls the Russian division of UberEats.A recent RBC report estimated the food delivery business in Russia to be 100 billion rubles (USD 1 billion) this year. While Yandex faces intense competition from the likes of Mail.Ru and Mitsui who have also made several acquisitions into food delivery startups, it is clear that there is a lot of business up for grabs.As such, given its dominant position in Russia and its expanding presence in more countries and cities, I am projecting a CAGR of its Yandex.Taxi business of about 54% over the next 5 years. This is conservative considering it should enjoy close to 300% YoY revenue growth for FY18.E-Commerce Yandex's e-commerce business was previously conducted through its Yandex.Market arm where it initially started as an online aggregator that allows for price comparisons. However, it was the weakest aspect of Yandex's various businesses with FY17 only seeing a 5% increase in revenue from FY16, a disappointing growth rate due to the immaturity of the Russian e-commerce industry that should allow for significant YoY growth. Furthermore, costs were increasing far faster than revenue which led to negative adjusted EBITDA (-162 million rubles) in Q1 FY18.Thus, it is with great relief that Yandex announced it would be overhauling its entire approach to e-commerce through a joint venture with Sberbank in October 2018. The new JV will have 3 platforms, Beru for domestic goods, Bringly for cross-border e-commerce site and the original Yandex.Market.Source: Sberbank Investor Day PresentationI am particularly bullish on Yandex's revamped approach to e-commerce considering the potential in Russia's still immature e-commerce industry. According to the Financial Times (FT), ""e-commerce is primed for growth in the country, where online retail only accounts for 3 per cent of all retail money spent, compared to 18 per cent in the UK, according to AITC, a trade body."" However, I am confident the conditions in Russia are favourable towards rapid growth in e-commerce. The internet penetration rate is 76% as of 2017 and as can be seen, is largely on par with the US.Source: World BankFurthermore, the Russian e-commerce industry as a whole has grown about 20% annually over the past few years. It reached 1.1 trillion rubles in 2017 as compared to 736 billion rubles in 2015 according to the Association of Online Retail Companies (AKIT). A Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) report predicts that the Russian e-commerce industry will grow at a CAGR of 24% over the next 4 years, from USD18 billion to USD31 billion by 2020. Russia is particularly attractive as it is currently the last big emerging market without a dominant online retailer like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) The fragmentation of the industry is apparent as the top 4 companies control less than a quarter of the market as compared to 63% and 84% in the US and China. The current fragmentation also means that Yandex is not too late. The struggle to become the dominant online retailer is an important fight considering that Morgan Stanley predicts that consolidation appears inevitable and a dominant online retailer worth USD10 billion will appear by 2020.Yandex's Beru platform will be build on Yandex.Market and will combine 1,000 individual existing sellers into a single marketplace and collect goods for sale in fulfilment centers. As of Q3, there are 100,0000 SKUs, with plans to increase to 250,000 by the end of the year. The current goal is ""to expand the platform in terms of the number of SKUs, number of merchants and GMV that it delivers."" The JV will also leverage Sberbank's existing client base where Sberbank counts 70% of the population as clients and Yandex Market already has 20 million users. There are currently over 370 thousand DAUs since the launch of beta testing in May 2018, making it one of the fastest growing marketplaces in Russia.One of the biggest problems facing e-commerce sites including the previous Yandex.Market was the undeveloped logistics infrastructure in Russia. Hence, I am bullish on Yandex's e-commerce ambitions due to the planned investments into logistics and fulfilment, with Sberbank pledging USD500 million. The JV will also utilise Sberbank's 16,000 branches across the country as pick up points thus giving it an edge over its competitors. It also plans to chase market share by subsidising delivery with free delivery for purchases over 3,500 rubles. Beru is aiming for 3-4 warehouses across Russia thus giving it next day delivery capabilities. Source: Sberbank Investor Day PresentationYandex has also created a cross-border e-commerce platform called bringly to latch onto Russian preference for cross-border offerings as seen in the 37% growth in cross-border e-commerce in 2016 as compared to a mere 6% growth for domestic e-commerce. Yandex has moved quickly, recently signing an agreement with Turkey's largest e-commerce site, Hepsiburada, giving Russians access to over 5 million SKUs. Merchants from China, Turkey, Korea, India and Israel have been added while merchants from the UK, Germany, US, France and Italy will be added in 2019 with the intention of having over 20 million SKUs by the end of 2019.However, Yandex has much to do to to catch up to its competitors. The previous Yandex.Market was not in the top 10 most visted E-commerce sites in Russia and it's clear that its biggest competitor is Aliexpress (NASDAQ: BABA). Aliexpress's popularity (over 22 million monthly visitors) also reflects Russia's penchant for cross-border e-commerce, particularly from China due to the relatively high quality and low price of Chinese products that are tax free.Source: Ecommerce Report Russia 2017Aliexpress has also been aggressive in expanding its market dominant position. In Sept 2018, it announced the the launch of a new JV with the Russian Direct Investment Fund, mobile operator Megafon and internet giant, Mail.ru. The new JV will try to capture more markets hare by leveraging on Mail.Ru's 100 million internet users as Russia’s largest email provider. The new JV will allow Russian consumers to buy from AliExpress merchants worldwide and will also provide Russian online sellers with access to the international markets through TMall. Alibaba president Michael Evans told Bloomberg that the JV will allow Alibaba to move beyond cross-border e-commerce and instead build “a much bigger local business.”Overall, I am bullish on Yandex's ability to become a dominant e-commerce force in the growing Russian e-commerce industry, particularly through its Beru platform. However, I am less bullish bullish on the ability of Yandex to compete in cross-border e-commerce considering that 90% of current cross-border orders are for Chinese goods and clearly Aliexpress looks set to maintain its dominant position. Yet, it is also clear that there is room for more than 1 player in any e-commerce market. If the joint JV is able to leverage on Sberbank's presence in nearly every Russian's life and create an efficient logistics and fulfilment system, it should be a leading e-commerce retailer.However, given the relative newness of the JV (worth USD1 billion), it is difficult to predict its growth rates especially as management has yet to provide any guidance. Furthermore, e-commerce revenues have been deconsolidated from Yandex's revenues and can instead be found in the 'Other Income' segment.Cloud BusinessThe cloud industry has really taken off in other countries, particularly in China and the US where companies such as Amazon, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Alibaba and Tencent (OTC: OTCPK:TCEHY) have enjoyed cloud driven revenue growth over the past few years. This seems to give the impression that by only starting out in Q3 FY18, Yandex has lost out on gaining a meaningful share of the cloud business in Russia. This could not be further from the truth and it can even be said that Yandex has to a certain extent, first movers advantage.This was confirmed by management during their Q2 earnings report where Mikhail Parakhin said that because “Russia uniquely lags other countries in terms of the cloud penetration,” Yandex has not lost out. Instead, management believes that Yandex is uniquely positioned to excel in the Russian cloud business due to their consistent compliance with regulators as well as being “operators of the biggest data centers in the country.A quick search shows that Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud does not currently over cloud services in Russia. This is related to the recent crackdown on Telegram in Russia on national security grounds which resulted in the blocking of 800,000 IPs used by Amazon Web Services and more than a million used by Google Cloud, essentially forcing AWS and Google Cloud out of Russia. Intentionally or unintentionally, the Russian government has cleared the space for Yandex Cloud to have first movers advantage. Yandex also has the government explicit support as the government is eager to ""transition to cloud technologies and digital transformation of business” as part of its 2017 Digital Economy plan.The only significant competitors in the Russian cloud industry are both foreign companies, Huawei and SAP. The others are ""relatively small companies that have modest resources,"" thus giving Yandex a comparative advantage from economies of scale as the largest operator of data centers in Russia. Yandex is also confident in its capabilities vis a vis SAP and Huawei as Yandex's “data centers are uniquely positioned to service traffic from the major populated areas in Russia with the lowest ping times… compliant with the data storage regulations.”The popularity of Yandex Cloud was emphasised by management in their recent Q3 earnings report. Since its its launch in September, it has received 8,500 requests from big enterprises and SMEs of which it has accepted the business of 5,000 companies. Yandex's client base is currently represented mostly by companies in the IT, Technology, Media and Telecom (TMT), retail and professional services industry.Yandex currently bundles its cloud business together with that of Yandex.Zen and Yandex.Drive (car sharing) components under the broader category of 'Experiments'. There are currently no meaningful estimates on how much the Russian cloud industry is worth or will be worth, however estimates for worldwide revenue of the public cloud industry has a 5 year CAGR of 21.9%. Given the relative newness of the Russian cloud industry and its growing business of Yandex.Drive, I have estimated a CAGR of about 55% over the next 5 years.Source: GartnerOthers (Media Service & Classifieds)Yandex also has a Media Services segment that was established in FY18, it was previously consolidated under Experiments. It consists of both music (Yandex Music) and video (Kinopoisk) and is another revenue driver that looks to be set on enjoying high growth in the short term.Yandex Music was launched in 2010 and has over 40 million tracks and over 20 million MAUs in Russia and the CIS region. It is one of the top music streaming apps in Russia, helped by the lack of competition, in particular, there is no Spotify presence in Russia after Spotify decided not to launch in 2015. It has been installed between 10 million to 50 million times on Google Play as of November 2017 and it is Russia's biggest non-gaming mobile application based on revenue, a rapid rise from its 4th position at the beginning of 2017. Subscription costs are USD 29 a year or USD 2.90 a month. Yandex Music also have plans for an international expansion outside of the old Soviet Union, as seen in its recent launch in Israel.Yandex bought Kinopoisk in 2013 when it was just an online film database, otherwise known as the IMDb of Russia. However, in 2015, it added video streaming with content from 9 streaming provider and has over 82 million monthly web visitors, a huge growth from its 33 million monthly visitors in 2015. Yandex has licensing deals with major local studios and TV networks such as Channel One, NTV, Mosfilm and Bazelevs to stream their content on Kinopoisk.However, the market for online video services in Russia pales in comparison to that of China and the US. According to J’son & Partners Consulting, the market of online video services in Russia is about USD100 million annually and the leading OTT service provider is ivi with estimated annual revenues at 42.6 million euros. Its other competitors include Okko which claims a 17% market share and Netflix.ConclusionMy fundamental bullish stance on Yandex is based on 2 beliefs. Firstly, that its current core business (search and business) has finally separated itself from Google to become the undisputed market leader in Russia and the CIS region. This will allow Yandex to continue to ride the global tailwinds in the online advertising industry for many more years to come. Secondly, Yandex is in the midst of a high growth phase and the future looks incredibly bright, especially for the next 5 years. I am projecting a 5 year revenue growth of about 30% excluding its e-commerce business. I am particularly bullish on its Yandex.Taxi and cloud business which will allow Yandex to diversify from its current status as a Search and Portal company.In a future article, I will be looking at the risks inherent in investing in a Russian stock and the macro outlook for the near term in Russia as well as an evaluation of whether Yandex is undervalued at current prices."
4216570,101850,2018-10-31T14:24:02-04:00,"Stronger than expected growth in search, experimental, and taxi businesses.The company posted its highest revenue growth since 2012.Search market share almost same as Google and still growing.Lower than expected loss in the taxi segment for 2018 as the core taxi business turned its first profit in 3Q 2018 on EBITDA basis, much ahead of market expectations.Arkady Volozh, the founder, has no intention of selling his stake or leaving the firm.","Yandex (YNDX) had a particularly good third quarter 2018 in terms of growth. Sales, EBITDA, and Net Income have all beaten estimates. Investors can derive confidence from the fact that revenue growth has been highest since 2012, taxi business has now turned profitable, and search business continues to gain market share. With such a leadership position and a pipeline of products/services, future prospects look bright and the business holds a lot of potential.Search and portal business continues to grow. It grew by 26% Y-o-Y during 3Q 2018 (source: Goldman Sachs report dated 29th October 2018). Search has shown decent momentum since the 2017 settlement between FAS and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) whereby Google was required not to disallow competing apps to be installed on Android devices. The chart below shows the steady growth in market share for Yandex which now stands at 49.2% (for Android devices), almost the same as Google's market share.source: UBS earnings report 3Q FY2018 dated 29th October 2018The company also has a 39.5% share in mobile search revenue. Geolocation services advertisers have also doubled in number year-on-year. Speaking of advertising, Yandex showed a 24% growth in online advertising revenue. Search and Portal guidance provided by the company has been updated to 21-23% instead of the earlier guidance of 20-22%. Management expects further gains in search market share and strong performance on the advertising front to contribute to future growth in the Search and Portal segment of the business.In the taxi segment, there has been a 344% revenue growth y-o-y, which is more than estimates but lower than the 426% seen in 2Q2018 (source: Goldman Sachs report dated 29th October 2018). A major milestone was achieved in the online core taxi business. It reached profitability for the first time (on EBITDA basis), leading to increased confidence among investors. The year 2018 is still expected to end in a loss for the taxi segment, but the losses would be mainly driven by food delivery investments, self-driving, and expansions in the international markets. The core taxi business is profitable and there is confidence in the business model in that area.Yandex had originally provided guidance of 30-35% increase in revenue for the year 2018. However, in light of good third quarter performance, the company has updated this guidance to 35-38% (source: conference call transcript dated 29th October 2018).On the regulatory front, the Russian government had recently announced that it will propose to limit foreign ownership in top news aggregators to 20%. Arkady, the founder CEO of Yandex, was born in Kazakhstan and holds a Maltese citizenship. Hence, there has been speculation that he may have to reduce his stake in Yandex. However, he assured during the earnings call held on 29th October that he has no such plans, thus assuring the investor community. It was also mentioned that if such a regulation did come in, then Yandex would be open to restructuring the business such that the news segment does not affect Arkady's shareholding with the larger core businesses.(Source: Factset)1) Talent - Being a technology company, Yandex is heavy on talent and light on physical assets. Technology-related talent is key to the success of the business. Being able to compete with other giants and hiring (and retaining) the best talent is a key aspect of future performance of this business.2) Search leadership position - Yandex has a leadership position in the desktop search market (source), and it is almost at the same market share level as Google in the mobile search market. It is expected to be in a leadership position in both these segments. Search is the biggest contributor to revenue for Yandex and good performance in this segment will affect earnings (and valuations) significantly.3) Expanding eco-system: Yandex has branched out from its core search business. It now offers cloud services and email services. It has a taxi business, a food delivery service, Zen-AI powered recommendation platform, and a media/entertainment segment as well. It has also partnered with Sberbank (OTCPK:SBRCY) for a payment platform. In this industry, the broader the ecosystem, the higher the economic value.4) Market growth and penetration - The internet penetration in Russia is about 74% (source), which is still below America's 89%. Growth in internet penetration across Russia and the growing market for search and other apps that Yandex offers is key to growing the business.Key risks to the business include:1) Macro environment: Currency exchange, interest rates, GDP growth can all affect the business. Falling ruble or rising interest rates can hurt future prospects of Yandex. GDP growth is directly correlated to advertising spends and advertising revenues.2) Competition in search/mobile/taxi - Biggest competition in search for Yandex is Google. While Yandex has caught up with Google quite impressively in terms of market share, the key will be to see whether Yandex can maintain a leadership position. There can also be competition for ad spends from websites other than search engines, such as social media networks.3) Marketing and distribution costs - Marketing costs, costs for acquiring users and traffic, and other marketing activities are important for driving revenue growth. Distribution costs include maintaining existing distribution networks through partners as well as incrementally expanding partners and growing the distribution network. These costs affect margins as well. Any disproportionate increase in marketing and distribution costs can adversely affect Yandex and reduce margins as well.4) Weak execution - With plenty of products in the pipeline and a constantly evolving technology space, future performance of Yandex depends a lot on the successful and effective execution of new products and services. Any shortcoming on the execution front can severely affect future prospects.5) Adverse Internet regulation in Russia - Any regulation on areas of privacy, piracy, or censorship has the potential to disrupt operations at Yandex and needs to be examined regularly."

Click here to find out more »Yandex (YNDX) is the largest technology company in Russia and the largest search engine on the internet in Russian. Personally, I admire the path the company has walked through, from a couple of enthusiasts in yearly 1990 to a large international company. Even now, the business is small in comparison to what it can be if it continues to develop the way it has. Operating in the CIS region, which is still immature in terms of internet coverage and e-commerce adoption, YNDX can easily double or triple in market capitalization in two to four years. Right now, YNDX trades at level that doesn't reflect the company's full potential.Yandex shares some similarities with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Both companies enjoy dominant market shares as search engine platforms, though Google’s share of the pie is incomparably larger because it provides its service globally. Yandex, on the other hand, has been able to maintain its >50% in Russia while competing neck-and-neck with behemoth Google. There are some government regulations in Russia, but that doesn’t limit Alphabet’s use of its technological strength. The companies have been sharing the CIS market for quite a while now, thus one must admit Yandex’s steadfastness.(Source: Yandex Investors presentation)Yandex tries its best to follow the latest technological and social trends. Though it cannot compete fully on a global scale, it has been very successful in implementing them in Russia and CIS. And I must admit, company management does an outstanding job staying relevant and very close to the international leaders. Yandex has several laboratories for breakthrough projects in different countries worldwide, including Silicon Valley.Recently, Yandex got a very successful project by merging forces with Uber (UBER) in CIS countries, which has picked up the pace of its business growth by doubling the segment’s sales. Food delivery looks like a hit too. The company also features AI assistant Alisa, Yandex.Cloud, Yandex.Disk, Yandex.Zen (algorithmic news feed), Yandex.Drive (car sharing), media subscription services, etc.Here is a current business structure:(Source: Yandex Investors presentation)Before we proceed any further, I want to plainly state that Yandex has been on the Russian market for a couple of decades and may successfully maintain its dominant position. I enjoy some of the services myself and value the company's effort to keep its technological edge.I want to share my unassuming investment thesis that Yandex’s price on current levels below 39 USD is not expensive, and this growing business that operates in developing countries deserves a portion in portfolios of long-term investors. Just look at the sales and operating income growth (USD-adjusted). Despite all the complications that happened with Russia, the business proved to be resilient by keeping its dynamics.(Source: Companies' financial reports YNDX, GOOGL)(Source: Companies' financial reports YNDX, GOOGL)When we talk about Yandex, there is more merit in its business than meets the eye. It passes a couple of very important value thresholds (see charts below):Reasonable or absent debt burden(Source: Company's financial statements)Moderate history of shares dilution(Source: Company's financial statements)The market of Internet-based services and e-commerce in the CIS is very far from saturation. According to Wikipedia, internet users in Russia reached 75% of total population in 2017, but only 5% of retail sales are made online. This is changing rapidly and provides many growth spots for Yandex. Please notice how the Taxi segment exploded over a couple of years.(Source: Yandex Investors presentation)From the start, Yandex’s team has been the pioneer in new technologies in the former USSR countries. I respect the company for remaining genuine and competitive to this day. There are companies in the world with significant impact and a great brand name that brings honor to one’s portfolio, and I am sure Yandex is one of them.Below is a chart of how the company is making improvements in its original web search segment, which provides a solid ground for the continuation of its growth story.(Source: Yandex Investors presentation)Hopefully, Yandex will outperform the market in 5-7 years' time, though investors may want a discount as protection from political risk.The company can significantly increase its sales and income, although the current price-to-sales doesn’t reflect the potential. Hot, cloud-focused companies have drawn a lot of attention recently, with their P/S ratio skyrocketing (average between 8 and 10). Compare Yandex and Alphabet with Salesforce.com (CRM) and Adobe (ADBE) on the charts below - the valuation is just too high for cloud companies and too low for good old search engines.(Source: Bloomberg)The only risk of investing in Yandex that matters is the unfriendly relationships with Western countries that Russia has developed since 2014. One should expect a 15-25% drop in price.In my opinion, Yandex (and Alphabet as well) is not expensive at a current price of $37-39. If you like the business and its history, now may be a good time to start a long-term position and add on later. I estimate that there is 15-20% of untapped potential in the short term of 3-6 months and far greater in the long run."

However, with such an impressive portfolio of initiatives, Yandex seems to be able to overcome these. Regulatory issues are also a permanent concern in Russia - though, having the only truly innovative company in the country, the government is more likely to cherish it rather than smother. International competition is undoubtedly harsh too. However, with a dominant market prone to monopolization, Yandex has a strong base for further expansion and is able to stand up against competition properly armed.Yandex is a top representative of the whole high-tech industry in Russia at still affordable multipliers. Valuation via a sum-of-the-parts approach implies the fair price to be closer to $48.4 per share.If you always wanted to invest in Netflix, Apple, Google and Amazon at the inception of their triumph and were too late, Yandex gives you the second chance."
4239444,70365,2019-02-08T11:39:16-05:00,Yandex is a leading search engine and internet services company in Russia.The company’s search & portal business is growing steadily and the company plans a roll out in new cities this year.Monetization of new portals is going well and the company is reaping rewards of its investments in auto infotainment systems.Valuation suggest the company’s shares are currently overvalued but could positively surprise in the long run.,"Amid steadily growing search & portal business, shares of Yandex (YNDX) have not changed significantly over the last decade, creating discrepancy which is unlikely to persist for a prolonged period of time. As the company’s top-line and bottom lines have been rapidly expanding, I believe it will not take much time before the share price catch up.Yandex N.V. is a leading Russian multinational internet and search engine company headquartered in Moscow. The company headcount currently counts over 7000 people in seven different divisions of which just one – search & engine – is durable growing and profitable. The rest of the company segments include e-commerce, taxi, classified advertisement, media services, and experiments. The greater majority of the company’s revenues comes from Russia (about 93 percent) with the latter coming from the rest of the world.Source: GlobalStatsTaking a closer look at the company’s segment revenue and EBITDA margins, it is clear that search & portal is the company’s most important segment. Over the last year, the company’s search & portal division has been growing its revenue at a stable rate of more than 20 percent and has managed to sustain its adjusted EBITDA margin over 40 percent. Even though taxi has skyrocketed in terms of revenue, its profitability has been in negative territory so far, presumably due to highly competitive and regulated nature of the market. Other segments such as media services and experiments have grown yet have also been unprofitable. Lastly, the e-commerce business line was profitable and growing for a while however has lately deteriorated.Source: Yandex Q3 2018 earnings slidesIn the third quarter, the company recorded significant developments on their platforms front and monetized over 800 small online stores using Yandex Turbo pages technology, accelerating online mobile shopping. According to the company’s statistics, monetization growth using Yandex Turbo pages has reached over 400 percent year-over-year. The company’s Geo Services have experienced a growth of over 90 year-over-year percent. Apart from that, the company successfully acquired a company called Edadil which designs and develops discount and promotion application and has over 6 million monthly active users in 16 cities around the world. Other positive developments came from the automotive industry where the company celebrated with successes of Yandex.auto, Yandex.navigator, Yandex.drive, Yandex.music and Yandex.radio platforms.Looking at the company’s financial statements, Yandex has had consistently high capital expenditures in recent years which signals that the company has been heavily investing into future growth and profitability. The company’s relatively low indebtedness - 29 percent total liabilities to total assets – gives it better resistance to market stress.Based on SimilarWeb’s website traffic statistics, the company’s online engagement and number of visitors have been on rise. In January, the company website recorded over 67 million visitors of which is 26 percent more than in August last year.Source: Similarweb.comPlugging-in Yandex's financial statements' figures into my DCF template, the company’s shares seem to be considerably overvalued. Under perpetuity growth method with a terminal growth rate of 2 percent, constant 24 percent annual revenue growth over the next five years and 15 percent EBIT margin, fair value of the stock comes at 571 RUB. Under the EBITDA multiple approach of a discounted cash flow model, the intrinsic value per share value of the company currently stands at 1255 RUB if we assume that the appropriate exit EV/EBITDA multiple in five years' time is around 10x.Source: Author's own Excel modelFrom a different perspective working with operating earnings multiples, Yandex' shares look a bit more attractive. Using the Fast Graphs forecasting calculator with 20 percent adjusted operating earnings growth rate assumption, the company's intrinsic value by the end of December FY2023 are forecasted to reach up to $48 USD. This implies upside potential of a total annualized rate of return of a little over 7 percent.Source: F.A.S.T. GraphsLastly, in the light of revenue variation of Peter Lynch's popular earnings line for the projection of intrinsic per share values of the company, Yandex' shares look probably the most attractive. According to my model, assuming 24 percent annual revenue growth, zero percent annual equity dilution factor, a price-to-sales PS ratio of around 5.9x, the company's share price by the end of 2021 could reach 3964 RUB. This scenario suggests an annualized rate of return potential of approximately 15 percent in the following years.Source: Author's own Excel modelTo sum up, Yandex is an outstanding internet company with a stable share in one of the most crucial markets in the world. Although the company seems to be overvalued, there is long-term potential. The company has been consistently growing core businesses and gradually increasing the number of its website portal visitors. With a planned expansion in cities outside the capital, Yandex is positioned to seize new opportunities and develop new partnerships.Disclaimer: Please note that this article has an informative purpose, expresses its author's opinion, and does not constitute investment recommendation or advice.

As I was writing in March, Yandex is the leader of the Russian search engine market and is one of the largest Russian tech companies, which gives it an opportunity to invest in various startups and new projects that help it to establish a stronger presence in the sector. And because of that, I continue to hold a long position in it and believe that the current share price represents a good buying opportunity.Looking at the Q2 earnings that were reported on Thursday, we could see that the quarter was mostly a success, as the revenue has grown to $472.8 million, up 34 Y/Y, while net income had massively increased by 857% to $531.1 million, primarily thanks to the non-recurring sale of its stake in Yandex.Market, a Russian version of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY), to the country's biggest bank Sberbank (OTCPK:SBRCY). That's why the profits were higher than the revenue during the period.Yandex's major business continues to be in the search and portal category, as it brings the most revenue. During the last few months, the company improved the results of its paid clicks by 10%, while the average cost of click rose by 6%.As for the non-core businesses like Media and Taxi, Yandex continues to heavily rely on them, as they now account for the 17% of the overall revenues that the company makes. Also, out of its overall cash and cash equivalents of $1,546.4 million, $433 million, which represent nearly one-third of those assets, came from the Taxi business alone in the last few quarters, which suggests that Yandex will continue to spend more resources into its new and innovate endeavors that will be unlocking additional shareholder value in the fields, where the company is not represented yet or underrepresented now.Based on this information, we could assume that the non-core assets, especially the taxi business, will continue to play a bigger role inside the company and make Yandex less risky by diversifying the company's overall portfolio.Source: YandexTo see a bigger picture, I decided to compare Yandex's major metrics and ratios to its domestic and international peers. Below is the table that shows other companies that have similar to Yandex businesses.Source: Yahoo Finance and GuruFocus. The table was created by the author.Yandex's multiples of the major ratios are slightly higher from the industry's median and average, but I think it also shows that the company trades closely to its current fair value. But let's not forget that Yandex has positive operating and net margins of 12.82% and 10.29%, respectively, and its cash and cash equivalents outweigh the overall debt, which means that it will be able to fund its future endeavors and sustain the current pace of growth in the long run. That's why I think we shouldn't worry about the high P/E of 69x or EV/EBIT of 41x at the moment.Going forward, Yandex expects its revenue to grow by 30% to 35% in the fiscal year 2018, which I think is a realistic goal, as the consolidated Q1 and Q2 results were in that range. Strong performance from its search and portal businesses along with the growth of the non-core assets suggests that there are a lot of opportunities to unlock shareholder value in the foreseeable future. Because of that I continue to hold my long position in Yandex, even though the stock slightly declined since my initial acquisition of the company's shares, and I do think that at the current price levels, it's a buy."

I started working in the Russian stock market in the mid-1990s - I lived in Russia for nine years in part as a stock market analyst for a handful of investment banks - and for most of that time, Russian assets have been cheap.The graph below shows the cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio (CAPE) for a range of markets. The CAPE uses the average for ten years of earnings and adjusts them for inflation. This smoothens the cyclicality of a single year P/E. It's more difficult to calculate, but it's a more complete valuation measure than the normal P/E ratio. According to the CAPE, Russia is the world's cheapest stock market by far, with a CAPE of just 6.5, compared, for example, to Hong Kong's 18.1 or Japan's 27.7.For starters, emerging market stocks are generally considered more risky… so they often trade at a valuation discount to developed markets.Russia is even a lot cheaper than other emerging markets, though, in part because of the perception (and reality) that political risk in Russia is higher than in many other emerging markets. The country has a reputation for instability.I was managing a hedge fund in Moscow during the summer of 2008 when Russia invaded neighbour and fellow former Soviet republic, Georgia. The Russian stock market crashed. But that was soon overshadowed by the full force of the global economic crisis, during which the Russian economy contracted by more than any other big global economy… and its stock market similarly underperformed nearly every other country.More recently, Russia's invasion and annexation of Crimea, a Ukrainian territory, in 2014, started a conflict that is still going on today. Russian president Vladimir Putin has an image as a power-hungry dictator who will do anything to stay in power. And, last month's so-called presidential elections, which saw the re-election of Putin to a fourth term, will do nothing to reduce the perception of political risk in Russia.Overall, it's enough to make you think that the country's market is a value trap.And, in early April, we were given another reason for Russian assets to remain cheap.On April 6, the U.S. Treasury Department announced new sanctions targeting seven Russian oligarchs, a dozen of the companies they own or control, 17 senior Russian government officials, and a state-owned weapons trading company and its banking subsidiary.Senior U.S. administration officials said the sanctions are a broader measure aimed at the ""totality of the Russian government's ongoing and increasingly malign activities in the world.""The short-term impetus for that measure was the spy universe… last month, a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned on British soil. UK Prime Minister Theresa May and many others think that the Russian state was culpable. So, in response, the UK announced the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats identified as ""undeclared intelligence officers"", the suspension of all planned high-level bilateral contacts between the UK and Russia, and plans to consider new laws to increase defenses against ""hostile state activity"", and a number of other measures.In response to the sanctions, Russian stocks crashed last week by 8.4 percent. Sanctioned aluminum producer Rusal, which is controlled by billionaire Oleg Deripaska, plunged more than 50 percent. The ruble also fell to its lowest level against the dollar since 2016.What happened was that investors indiscriminately sold anything related to Russia. No one wanted to be left holding the next Russian company whose CEO the U.S. government decides is close to Putin. So, it's easier to sell first.Another one of the stocks that was hit hard is Russia's answer to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). It's a US$11 billion market cap company called Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX). It is the world's fourth-largest Internet search provider. And it has around a 55 percent market share of the Russian internet search market (in part because the Russian government has made it very difficult for Google to operate in Russia). For comparison, Google has a 42 percent market share in Russia.Yandex doesn't just operate in the search engine space. The company has an email service and a cloud storage product. It has also launched a voice-enabled digital assistant called Alice. Yandex also has a ride-hailing and food delivery business. And, in March, it formed a joint venture with Uber (NYSE:UBER) (valued at more than US$3.8 billion) to combine their ride-hailing and food delivery businesses in Russia.Yandex has also developed a self-driving car (which it's already testing in Russia). It also recently signed a deal with Russian state-run bank Sberbank to create a joint e-commerce venture. And it has introduced a new feature for online shopping in around 76,000 global stores and services that give customers the option of paying for purchases in installments.So, Yandex is a rapidly growing company that's expanding far beyond search. Revenues were up 24 percent in 2017, and adjusted net income grew 9 percent.However, the stock's performance leaves a lot to be desired. The shares are up 150 percent since early 2016. But the stock is at about the same price level today as it was for its IPO in 2011 (although revenues are up 160 percent in U.S. dollar terms since then). And after the recent selloff, the shares are down 25 percent over the past month. On April 9, in response to U.S. sanctions, it fell 12 percent.But here's the thing. Yandex, or its CEO, Arkady Volozh, is highly unlikely to be targeted by the U.S. government, or anyone else. He's not really on the radar. He's not a chum of Putin's, and (unlike the heads of businesses that may be included on a second wave of U.S. sanctions) he didn't make his money by knowing the right people at the right time in the Russian government.Yandex has to colour between the lines set by the Kremlin - as does any business in Russia, China, and other economies where the government plays a big role in the economy. But he's the opposite of a Russian oligarch who's going to fall under U.S. sanctions.At least as importantly, American problems with Russia haven't usually touched on technology. Russia is a commodities-driven economy (despite years of rhetoric about diversifying its economy), and its search engine isn't really a concern to the U.S.I've followed and liked Yandex for a long time (I recommended it to the subscribers of a premium investment service I wrote several years ago). If relations with the west further sour, or if hot words turn to hot war in Syria, Yandex shares are going to suffer along with other Russian shares. But if not, Yandex is a great example of a stock that's being unfairly tarred with the rest of a difficult market and likely to recover sooner rather than later."
4164680,103395,2018-04-22T20:09:57-04:00,The company's shares fell sharply in price due to the weakening of the ruble.Yandex shows high growth rates of revenue and profit.The company's intrinsic value is much higher than the current market capitalization.,"After the deal with Uber (UBER) in July 2017, I was very negative about Yandex (NYSE:YNDX) shares because I was sure that the Federal Antimonopoly Service would not allow such merger. Despite this, Yandex shares grew all the rest of the year and in March they already cost $44 per share. Now that the Yandex share is at $33 and the company's capitalization is about $10 billion, I believe that it's time to consider Yandex for buying.In 2017, Yandex showed a significant increase in revenue +24% Y/Y to $1.6 billion. Net profit has grown even stronger despite the costs related to Yandex Taxi. For 2017, net profit was $150 million, +28% Y/Y.Yandex shows revenue and profit growth in the last few years except for 2015-2016, when the company's dollar-denominated results were affected by the devaluation of the ruble, but we'll talk about this at the end of the article.From the standpoint of financial health, Yandex looks perfect: the company does not use borrowed funds at all, and short-term assets exceed short-term liabilities by more than 2 times.According to Finviz, TTM P/E of Yandex is more than 77, but the forward P/E is only 22. Such a strong spread is associated with the ride-hailing segment of Yandex and the forecasted exchange rates. Therefore, for the valuation of Yandex, I decided to separately evaluate each of the company's segments, based on the multiples of competitors and recent mergers of the company itself.Source: Yandex ReportLet's start with the main segment of the company - Search and Portal. In total, this segment occupies 90% of Yandex's revenue. As a peer group, I chose several companies with a similar business model: Chinese search service - Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), the main Russian competitor of Yandex - Mail.ru Group and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). All listed companies have roughly the same growth rates of revenue and profits.In 2017, revenue for the Search and Portal segment was $1.45 billion. The average P/S multiplier for this peer group is 6.7x. Then the capitalization of Yandex's Search and Portal segment alone is $9.715 billion. If we do the calculation with adjusted net profit, the result will be 20-25% lower, but the results of 2017, in my opinion, are much lower than the potential results in 2018 (Q4 2017 net profit +189% compared to Q4 2016), what proof such difference in the company's current and forward P/E multiples. Therefore, I consider the P/S multiplier to be more acceptable, although its result gives a very optimistic valuation.In the Russian market of search services, Yandex occupies 56% of the total market, while on the Android platforms Yandex's share is 45%.This segment of the business is still unprofitable by EBITDA, while revenue in 2017 increased by 111% compared to 2016. And the number of completed rides has grown 2.5 times.As the value of the combined company, I will use $3.8 billion, which was indicated at the merger of Yandex and Uber (UBER) in July last year.The combined company already plans to conduct an IPO in 2019.The third-largest segment of the company is the e-commerce platform Yandex Market. At the end of 2017, the company raised $500 million of investment from Sberbank (OTCPK:SBRCY), with a valuation of $1 billion. On the opportunities of Yandex in e-commerce, I wrote in my last article.In addition to the three main areas of business, Yandex has Classifieds and Experiments segment. This segment includes small but ambitious projects of the company, including the service for the sale of cars - Auto.ru and all media services (including KinoPoisk, Yandex.Music, Yandex.Afisha, and Yandex.TV program).Revenue for them in 2017 amounted 3.7 billion rubles (about $65 million). And growth compared to 2016 was more than 70%. If we take the same multiplier as in the case of the core business, we get $435 million.And now we will sum up all segments of the company:Total equity value is $14.95 billion. The current capitalization of Yandex is $10.8 billion, which leaves the potential for growth of 38%.The current drop in Yandex's shares was due to imposed sanctions from the US and with the subsequent weakening of the ruble. Yandex painfully reacts to changes in the USD/RUB currency pair and shows growth when the ruble is strengthening. Given the fact that the current ruble weakening was temporary, Yandex shares can fully recover after correction in the near future."
4157078,103395,2018-03-16T10:37:40-04:00,"What is now happening with E-commerce in Russia?
        A new business model that will lead to the growth of Yandex's market capitalization.
        A joint venture with Sberbank and the potential synergies.
        Yandex is too expensive compared to other E-commerce companies.","Yandex (NASDAQ: YNDX) is one of the largest Internet companies in Russia. The company is developing several business areas, and today I would like to talk about one of them, which in my opinion will become the largest for Yandex in the next 10-15 years. This area is E-commerce, and Yandex has all chances to become the largest player in this market. But now the company is very expensive and therefore, I do not recommend buying the company's shares at current prices.Despite the rather large penetration of the Internet (more than 70%) and the penetration of smartphones (more than 60%), the E-commerce market in Russia remains very small and accounts for less than 5% of all purchases inside the country. For example, in the United States, 1/10 purchases are accounted by the Internet.Primarily such a situation is caused by the extensive segmentation of the market. Large shares are held by AliExpress (NYSE: BABA) and Yandex.Market, while the remaining, which is more than 50% of the market, is divided into more than 10 small online stores. Moreover, it is the lack of a leader that slows the growth of the market as a whole.Yandex.Market may become such a leader in the next 10 years, but only if the business model is completely changed. Now Yandex.Market works as an aggregator of other stores, and its main function is to compare prices of other stores. Despite such uselessness, the company occupies about 10% of the E-commerce market because of the scale of Yandex itself.In my opinion, the company should go to the Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) model and carry out all the actions for the sale and delivery of goods independently. Yandex needs to abandon the mediation and build their warehouses to store products from different manufacturers and sellers and carry out direct sales through their service.Also, it is necessary to enable consumers to pay for purchases online and not only cash on delivery as is now. Given that Yandex has its own online payment service - Yandex.Money, this change will also lead to synergistic winnings. Also, it can make online payments in cooperation with Sberbank. For example, they can give discounts or privileges when using Sberbank cards or Yandex.Money service.Also, as I said, Yandex needs their own warehouses and contracts with the delivery services of goods. With Yandex's scale and potential sales volumes, consumers and producers and Yandex itself will benefit from this.Despite the huge potential of this segment, Yandex is developing its E-commerce very slowly, and we can see it in the recent annual report. In 2017 E-commerce company's business brought about 5 billion rubles (about $85 million), which was slightly more than 5% of total Yandex revenue. And in comparison with 2016, the revenue grew by only 5%, which is the slowest growing segment of the company.source: Yandex annual reportPerhaps Yandex began to think about the E-commerce potential because in 2017 they announced the creation of a joint venture with Sberbank (OTCPK: SBRCY). Sberbank paid 30 billion rubles (about $500 million) for 45% of Yandex.Market. Another 45% will remain in possession of Yandex, and 10% will go to pay management.More than that, management announced to Sberbank investors its plans to reach 500 billion market share by 2020. In 2017, the E-commerce market in Russia was 1 trillion, considering about 10-15% market growth, we can assume that the share of Yandex.Market can grow to 35-40%, that is, growing every year at the double-digit rate. In the past few years, this growth was not active, or rather, there was no growth at all.source: Yandex annual report The deal with Sberbank opens additional synergies for the company:1) Firstly, this is the largest audience of Sberbank (about 80% of the country's population) which can be advertised by Yandex.Market.2) Secondly, the possible use of a vast network of Sberbank for the storage or delivery of goods, given that Sberbank itself plans to gradually abandon its ""departments"" in favor of online operation.3) Sberbank's cooperate with more than half of Russia's businesses, which will establish partnerships with large and small sellers of goods for Yandex.Market.source: Websitesources: Ycharts, FinvizAt the same time, despite the potential for E-commerce in Russia, now Yandex is very expensive. Above you can see the world's E-commerce players and their multipliers. Yandex looks more expensive than JD because it is unprofitable and more expensive than Amazon, which has greater opportunities and takes concrete actions in its business. And if we compare Yandex with competitors of its traditional business in the face of the Russian company - Mail.ru Group and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) - we can also notice the overvaluation of Yandex.The potential for E-commerce in Russia is huge. Especially when your ally is the country's largest bank. But now JV has not taken any action to create and develop a new company, but Yandex shares are growing every day. Therefore, I recommend you to refrain from any position on Yandex before the active steps of this venture developed."
4115788,51022,2017-10-24T11:24:27-04:00,Yandex’s key revenue stream is its search system despite the ongoing decrease of its participation ratio in the company’s revenue structure.Yandex Taxi is the company’s most perspective segment in the near future.Yandex’s shares are traded above their fair value level in my financial model’s base scenario case.Further growth potential in the company’s shares is possible but is highly uncertain.,"To analyze Yandex’s (YNDX) current financial situation and to make projections for the near future it is necessary to consider the company's revenue structure and its dynamics over the last three years:(Source: Yandex website)On the graph above we see a declining revenue participation ratio for the Search and Portal segment: during the last two years the category has lost 4.2% to other revenue streams. The most perspective trend is demonstrated by the Taxi segment after the launch of a web version of the Yandex Taxi service in 2012. From 2015 to 2017 Yandex Taxi revenues have more than doubled, fueled by unprecedented spending on marketing (the annual report shows that marketing costs exceeded revenues yielding negative EBITDA over the last two years). The E-Commerce segment holds its position in the revenue structure growing at an average rate. The same is true for the Classifieds business.(Source: Annual and Transition Report 2016)Looking at the Operating Income chart, we see that the Search and Portal business is used to finance the growing E-Commerce and, in particular, the Taxi segments, as Yandex considers these markets vital for the company’s success in the near future. In 2016, Yandex spent 7.8 billion RUB (about $134M) on the Yandex Taxi and Yandex Market (the main constituent of the E-Commerce segment) services, promoting them in Russia and the CIS. For comparison, in 2015 this number was only around 2.6 billion (representing growth of 300%).Recently, Yandex had to leave the Ukrainian market due to local government intrusion. It was the second-largest market for the company’s operation. In Russia, the company’s most significant competitor is, unsurprisingly, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which has been increasing its share in the search market for the last 2.5 years:(Source: Liveinternet)Google has increased its share in the search market from 31.7% in October 2014 to 40.8% in April 2017, according to Liveinternet.ru, while Yandex’s share has been decreasing over the same period. The main reason for this dynamic is Google’s active promotion in the Russian market. The integration of the search system into a web browser (Firefox for Yandex and Chrome for Google) also has made a significant impact on the numbers: with the growing popularity of Google Chrome in Russia the share of Google’s search system also is growing.Yandex Taxi is a mobile aggregator, which is rapidly expanding in Russia. The niche of the transportation market is on the rise in Russia and the CIS. Currently, the market share of the mobile aggregator worldwide is only around 5% (Source: Discovery Research Group). I see a high potential for growth here for Yandex with the largest local market share of approximately 60%. Yandex’s most significant competitors here are Gett and Uber (NYSE:UBER). These two companies came into the Russian market after Yandex, and now there has been cutthroat competition on the local level between the three. To cool down the situation Uber and Yandex combined their services in a joint operation in Russian and the CIS.(Source: Companies' websites)The ride-hailing companies operating in Russia and CIS use different expansion strategies. Gett is rapidly increasing the number of cities it covers, while Yandex seems to be focused on increasing market share in existing operations. Uber is a new player on the Russian and the Eastern European markets but the company is catching up. I forecast a rapid increase in the number of cities covered by the mobile taxi aggregators and the growth of the mobile aggregators’ ratio in the overall taxi market in the region. It will be possible with the spread of the fast Internet connection across large territories in Russia and the CIS. Hence, in the mid-term I expect the Taxi and the E-Commerce segments to be the main revenue growth substitutes for the Search business in the company’s consolidated top line.I like using the DCF model for valuing companies with positive cash flows and standardized balance sheets. Yandex falls into the category. My DCF model for the company is based on the following assumptions:- The EBIT CAGR is set on the level of 18.9% for the period 2017-2022. The EBIT CAGR for the period of 2011-2016 was 21%. Hence, a margin of error is integrated into the model at this level already;- The CAGRs for unlevered net income and cash flows are set to be 20.9% and 17.2%, respectively;- The beta for Yandex’s shares is calculated at 1.75, while the cost of equity is around 21.1%;- Hence, the discount rate used to discount the projected cash flows, WACC, is 20.5%;- The terminal EBITDA multiple in the base scenario is 11.5.On the graph below, one can see a sensitivity table of fair values for Yandex’s shares with a WACC of 19%, 20% and 21%, respectively:(Source: Author's DCF Model)According to the fair value figures, the downside risk in the base scenario with a 11.5x EBITDA multiple and a WACC of 20% is approximately 10% given the current share price of around $31.A positive scenario with an EBIT CAGR of 21.5% shows very little upside, too (the table was constructed when the share price was around $27):(Source: Author's DCF model)From the numbers' point of view, Yandex’s future operational success already has been reflected in the share price. While we can see a potential for Yandex’s businesses in the mid-term, there does not seem to be room for a justified appreciation of the securities’ price. The Taxi and the E-Commerce segments are the company’s primary bets. But currently they are users of cash. Strategically, Yandex is doing the right thing: it uses its cash cow, the Search business, for fuel growth in the rising stars, which later may become the cash cows. Financially, this strategy already has been reflected in the company’s market capitalization. As a result, I recommend monitoring the share price, while waiting for a better entry point. I set the target price range for Yandex’s stock at $25 – $27 per share. Above that price level the risk is not justified, in my opinion."
4187451,102683,2018-07-16T09:07:06-04:00,YNDX is breaking out higher.Its fundamental growth is impressive.I am buying stock in this name.,"Yandex (YNDX) is breaking out higher following strong fundamental growth. A number of YNDX properties are seeing triple-digit annual growth currently, signaling that there is strong demand for a number of areas management is investing in. Moreover, its share price is similarly trading higher as investors pile on behind the company’s future growth prospects. I am buying stock in this name as its fundamental growth fuels further investor optimism.YNDX looks attractively valued at current levels as management expands its operations into a number of different areas, all experiencing impressive growth.The Internet and technology company operates an Internet search engine in Russia and internationally. It offers search, location-based, personalized, and mobile services that enable users to find information, and communicate and connect over the Internet from desktops and mobile devices.In the most recent quarter, its Search and Portal revenues grew 19% year-over-year, mainly driven by revenue growth on Yandex owned properties, as well as great performance across its segments such as Taxi, Classifieds, and Media Services, according to its earnings call.Management continues to change its approach to bidding for its advertisers. Previously, advertisers were bidding for specific entry positions, either for positions in priority placement on top of organic search, or a guaranteed position at the bottom of the searches page. With the change of its bidding approach, advertisers will now target the specific amount of traffic they want to receive, while its algorithms will choose which ad layout to use, placing it accordingly on the result page to provide the desired amount of traffic, according to its earnings call. YNDX aims to increase the quality of traffic for its advertisers, believing that this change in the auction approach, combined with the increased variety of ad layout and greater personalization of ad results, will increase ROIs for its advertisers that should boost ad budgets allocated towards online in general and YNDX.The company also launched the transformation of its platform into a one-stop shop, which in addition to text-based advertising, now allows it to run better ads on its platform. The platform will allow advertisers to automate the process of creating apps and get statistics across all of their ad products in the sales funnel.Its overall search share reached 56.5% in March 2018, up 160 basis points compared with a year ago. Its search share on desktop hit record levels, gaining 270 basis points year-over-year and averaging 67.5% in March. Moreover, its share of mobile traffic significantly increased and reached 42% of its total search traffic. Mobile revenues represented 34% of its total search revenues. Management also expects its e-commerce revenues to improve gradually throughout the year, supported by its investments in advertising and marketing, quality improvements of the existing product, as well as new product launches.Yandex.Taxi is another quickly growing unit for the company, recently completing the combination of its ride sharing businesses with Uber. Revenues of Yandex.Taxi were up 301% year-on-year in the most recent quarter as the company continues its geographical expansion. The combined business operates in 177 cities with a population of 100,000+ and 69 cities with a population of 50,000+ across nine countries. Its total number of rides grew 222% year-over-year, with an adjusted EBITA loss that was impacted by a one-off payment for professional services connected with the deal, as well as the addition of Uber and investments in the Food Delivery service that they are building up. These expenses were partly offset by the continued optimization of incentives for users and drivers, particularly on the Yandex.Taxi side.Revenues of its Classifieds business grew 92% year-on-year during the quarter, primarily driven by revenues from listing fees and VAS which increased 112% year-on-year. Adjusted EBITDA of Classifieds was negative RUB287 million as YNDX continues to invest in strengthening its positioning across all of its geographies.Below is a chart of the company’s revenue and earnings per share. Over the last two years, revenue has accelerated at an impressive pace, nearly doubling from $900M to $1.8B. EPS has lagged behind due to management’s continued investment in its properties. The company is on a strong growth trajectory, aiming to increase the geography of its operations, which looks to be paying off as of now.Below is a chart of YNDX’s share price over the last half decade. Although its share price has been largely sideways since its IPO, there is currently a lot of positive momentum behind the stock due to its strong growth trajectory in recent years. Following increased market volatility in 2018, especially in international equities, YNDX’s share price has consolidated. Its recent breakout above $35 though signals that investor optimism could continue throughout the second half of 2018, potentially leading its share price to record levels.YNDX is currently on a strong growth trend higher, but its large presence in emerging markets is both a benefit and a hindrance. Should market volatility remain in emerging markets, especially with the emergence of geopolitical events, YNDX’s share price could falter. It is nonetheless experiencing strong growth currently, reaching strategic partnerships with Uber. Its share price has traded higher on this growth and looks to potentially be on its way to record levels should fundamentals continue to improve investor sentiment."

Since 1997, it has delivered world-class, geographically relevant search and locally tailored experiences on all digital platforms, based on innovative technologies.Additionally, Yandex has developed market-leading on-demand transportation services (Yandex.Drive and Yandex.Taxi), navigation products, and other mobile applications for millions of consumers across the globe. The main competitors of the company in the Russian and CIS markets are Mail Ru Group (OTC:MLRUY) and QIWI plc. (NASDAQ:QIWI).(Source: 1Q 2018 Results)In this article, I am going to cover insights of YaC 2018, an annual IT conference that is held by Yandex to roll out new products and services. This conference is justly considered to be one of the main IT events in Europe. During the conference, the company has come out with some very interesting new products and services that, within several years, will considerably affect its business profile.Also, I will describe other developments in the company's business model that have occurred recently.I have been very excited by the extent of technological developments that Yandex has announced during YaC 2018.The company has released Alice, the first Russian intelligent assistant available for iOS and Android. Initially, Alice was introduced on October 10, 2017, but its beta version was released only in May 2018 during the conference.Alice is positioned as a personal assistant that can help you find and book a restaurant, learn English, check the weather, order food, transfer money and do a bunch of other things. Although there are plenty of virtual assistants, like Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Siri, Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) Google Assistant, Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa and Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Cortana, none of them are used in Russia. Alice will help Yandex capture its niche in the Russian virtual assistants market.(Source: Photo from YaC 2018 - GadgetPark)To evolve Alice more rapidly, the company has released Yandex.Dialogs, a free opensource platform for use of the virtual assistant.As of today, Alice integrates many Yandex services, such as Search, News, Weather, Music, Maps and Taxi, and also includes over a dozen games. The external skills platform for Alice is currently in beta, and includes such skills as ordering pizza from Papa John’s. Actually, now every business can build in Alice with new skills - for example, the largest English school in Russia has already launched its own Alice-based virtual assistant that can teach you English. This ""skill"" can teach you how to pronounce words, use grammar and can test your writing skills.Alice is available in Russian in the Yandex Search app and Yandex Browser on iOS and Android, as well as with Yandex Browser on Windows.Although it is not clear how exactly will Alice affect financial results of the company, I am sure that Alice is a foundation stone for the next-generation products and services and the key element in strengthening the company's position in the search and portal segment in the Russian and CIS markets.(Source: Yandex.Dialogs)It has also been announced that Yandex will significantly expand its car-sharing facilities. During the next three months, the company will add in its car-sharing park 507 cars in total: 500 Mercedes, 5 BMWs and 2 Porsche 911 Carrera 4S.I recall that in February 2018, Yandex decided to change its car-sharing business model. In spite of simply aggregating all car-sharing operators on its platform, it launched its own independent service. Taking into consideration that at this moment there are around 2000 cars in Yandex's car-sharing park, the new cars add up to 2500 cars, which makes the company the biggest car-sharing operator in Russia.(Source: TrueSharing.ru)Bearing in mind its appetite for M&A activities (a deal with UBER in 2017, an acquisition of a food delivery startup Food Fox in 2017, and an acquisition of a Russian taxi company RusTaxi) and the fact that Yandex has around RUB 65.7 billion in cash and term deposits, which is equivalent to USD 1.1 billion, I expect the company to acquire some of its car-sharing competitors.The shift in business model from the aggregator to the operator should improve the company's revenue growth profile but significantly increase costs of scaling the business due to increased CAPEX requirements and higher operating expenses.(Source: 2017 Annual Report)The car-sharing business is one part of Yandex's driving business. Another one is a peer-to-peer ridesharing, taxi cab, food delivery company Yandex.Taxi. From late 2016, Yandex has been intensively investing in the geographical expansion of the business. As of December 2017, the service was available in 167 cities with 100,000+ population, and in 56 cities with a population of 50,000+ across Russia and CIS.In July 2017, the company entered into a transaction between Yandex.Taxi and Uber (NYSE:UBER) to combine its ride-sharing and food delivery businesses in Russia and CIS. Having received all necessary regulatory approvals, Yandex.Taxi and Uber completed the combination of their ride-sharing businesses on February 7, 2018. The combined company valuation at closing equaled to USD 3.8 billion on a post-money basis.In March 2018, Yandex announced that it started operating in Latvia - the first European market for the Russian IT giant.(Source: 2017 Annual Report)While the revenue of the taxi business segment has been growing steadily for the last two years, I think that this business unit can run Yandex into big financial trouble. Yandex.Drive accounted for approximately 5% of the total revenue in 2017, while generating 17% of the company's total operating expenses.On the one hand, it seems that the further development of the Taxi segment and expansion into other European markets pose a risk of long-term unprofitability for the company. On the other hand, the deal with Uber should save a bunch of money, since the intensity of competition has decreased significantly after the deal.This last thesis is supported by the most recent UBS report:And according to 1Q 2018 financial results, the deal with Uber has already started to make positive contributions to Yandex's financials. EBITDA margin increased to -55% up from -160% Y/Y.(Source: 1Q 2018 Results)Another service that has been announced during YaC 2018 is Yandex.Plus, which, once again, completely changes the company's business model. Yandex has a number of services, like Yandex.Music, Yandex.Drive, Yandex.Cinema, etc., and before Yandex.Plus was announced, all users had to buy access to every service separately, which was quite disturbing. Yandex.Plus offers users a subscription model where they pay RUB 169 to receive access to all products and services instantaneously. This should significantly simplify the process of marketing of new products and increase positive user experience. Now, in order to roll out a new product, Yandex can just add it into Yandex.Plus and all users will know about it.In 2000, the company launched Yandex.Market, which is, as of today, one of the most popular aggregation services in Russia. The platform provides users with product information, price comparisons and consumer reviews. As of the end of 2017, Yandex.Market had approximately 150 million products across 2,500 categories listed.As we can see from the company's filings, revenue from the e-commerce segment equaled USD 4.96 billion in 2017. In 2017, Yandex experienced some serious problems with this segment. While the overall e-commerce market grew to RUB 1040 billion, up from RUB 920 billion (+13% Y/Y), the company's e-commerce revenue struggled to grow, increasing only by 5%.To battle the limitations of the old business model, it has launched a new service called Yandex.Take, and comparing to this new service, Yandex.Market looks like a poor's man Amazon.(Source: 2017 Annual Report)Yandex.Take has been launched as a joint venture of Yandex and Sberbank (OTCPK:SBRCY). Putting it simply, Yandex has shifted from a pure aggregation model and turned itself into potentially one of the biggest internet retailers in the Russian and CIS markets with its own wholesales and logistics facilities.This shift in the e-commerce business model means that after the deal with Sberbank is closed and the service starts operating, the company's revenue will completely change its nature. Currently, Yandex.Market is priced on a cost-per-click (CPC) basis, and with the launch of Yandex.Take it will operate more like an ordinary online retail generating revenue by taking commissions on every product sold. As a result, the average operating margin should decrease from the current 30-50% to the levels of typical online retails like Amazon, which has an operating margin of 2-3%.The Russian e-commerce market is expected to hit RUB 1250 billion in 2018, and in order to reach the same level of the operating income that Yandex currently generates from Yandex.Market, the company will have to take approximately 8-9% of the Russian e-commerce (considering 2.5% operating margin). This seems to be a piece of cake for the leading search engine company in the market.In fact, I suppose Yandex can eventually take a similar 30-40% share of the e-commerce market as Amazon has in the US. This will allow the company to increase its e-commerce operating income at least fourfold during the next several years.Yandex is a very attractive investment opportunity. New products and services that the company has rolled out during YaC 2018 and the recent changes in the key business verticals show that it is ready to disrupt itself in order to meet market demands and follow the most lucrative business trends. Here is a list of the key changes in Yandex's business model:I am long Yandex N.V. with a price target of USD 42-45 per share.This article mentions the following companies: Yandex N.V. (YNDX), Mail Ru Group (MLRUY), QIWI plc. (QIWI), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB)."
4157099,101963,2018-03-16T11:49:32-04:00,"Despite its country being under sanctions, Russian internet holding company Yandex has been successfully reporting positive earnings results in the last few quarters.While there is a geopolitical risk attached to Yandex, the company has made a number of non-core diversification moves that could reduce the risk of holding its shares.Yandex has a great potential to continue to deliver growth, despite being under the constant pressure because of the actions of its home country.","Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, Russian companies have been under constant heat from Western institutions that have imposed a number of sectorial sanctions against them. While a number of companies from oil & gas and banking industries experienced wide losses after that, Russian biggest internet holding company Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) was lucky enough not to be on a sanctions list. The only loss that the company accounted in the last few years was the seizure of its assets in Ukraine in May of 2017, after the decision of the Ukrainian president to sanction the company along with other Russian internet sites and social media apps like VK, OK, Mail.ru and others. Apart from that, Yandex has been thriving in the last few quarters and continues to enjoy its near monopoly status in the Russian internet sphere.If we take a look at the recent earnings results for the full fiscal year, we will see that Yandex has considerably outperformed its previous year results, as its revenue in FY17 was $1.6B, up 24% Y/Y, while the net income has also increased by 28% to $150M year over year. The company continues to be the leader of the Russian online advertising space, internet search sector and the dominant service provider in a number of different industries.While the positive financial results create an additional room for growth, the political risk is going to continue to haunt Yandex in the foreseeable future. Recently, Russia has been accused by the United Kingdom in using nerve agent attack on its territory, which resulted in Prime Minister’s May decision to expel 23 Russian diplomats from the country. In addition, United States and European Union condemned Russian move and said that such attacks are unacceptable in today’s world and this could lead to new sanctions in the future.On a bright side, in November, Russia announced that it plans to prepare an infrastructure plan along with other BRIC country members to create an independent internet, which will be less vulnerable to cyber attacks. Considering the fact that the project was initially proposed by Russia, Yandex might have a great chance to benefit from such a move and increase its influence in the other countries of the BRIC membership. As for now it’s too soon to tell about the possible pros and cons of this project and we should wait for more news to come regarding it.Image: YandexIn order to reduce the political risk and to diversify its portfolio, in the last year Yandex has used its free resources to arrange important deals and invest in the new non-core assets that have the potential to create shareholder value in the long term and make its shares more attractive for average investors.For example, in February, Yandex announced that it finally completed the merger of its taxi service app with Uber (UBER) in a number of countries in the CIS region and the new joint venture is currently being valued at around $4 billion. In addition, in the last couple of months, Yandex signed a $1 billion deal with the Russian state-run bank Sberbank  (OTCPK:OTCPK:SBRCY) to create a joint e-commerce venture that will tap the country’s online marketplace. It also managed to reorganize its media unit, which is now expected to boost sales and make the business more efficient.For FY18, Yandex expects its revenue to increase by 25% to 30% Y/Y, and it believes that the joint venture with Uber will be one of the main catalysts of such a growth. In addition, its traditional Search and Portal business is also expected to deliver double-digit growth and the overall outlook for the company in 2018 is positive, according to the management.As we can see, it’s hard to analyze Yandex without bringing the Russian state into consideration. Since 2014, the company has been one of the few big businesses that hasn't been directly sanctioned by the Western institutions. One of the main advantages that the company has at the moment is its near monopoly status in the Russian internet sphere and the fact that almost all of its services are targeting users that are primarily from Russia or its neighbor countries. The recent diversification of the non-core assets is expected to create new investment opportunities that will push the company’s stock higher if the political situation remains calm.I personally have no position in Yandex, but for those of you who are interested in having a Russian company in your own portfolio, I can easily say that Yandex is one of the best stocks to hold. It has a great number of advantages in comparison to its peers and the political risk is relatively small in comparison with the companies from the oil & gas or banking sectors."
4092959,91145,2017-08-01T00:24:01-04:00,"Yandex remains on track, and its revenue guidance is revised upwards.Search and Portal show convincing growth and support valuation.However, estimates for Yandex.Taxi should be revised, requiring a new sum-of-the-parts valuation.Investors can rest assured: plenty of upside remains in the stock.","The recent deal with Uber (NYSE:UBER) showed the investment world that Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) is much more than just a Russian search engine. However, the freshly published Q2 results confront investors that the internet company is still highly dependent on Search and Portal. What's more, the growth path for a couple of other divisions could be less smooth than anticipated. Now, should we revise our sum-of-the-parts valuation? Let's do the math!On the surface, Yandex's Q2 results showed that the company is well on track to meet its revenue growth goal. In fact, management increased growth guidance to 18-21% for full 2017 (previously 17-20%). This is conservative, considering the 23% year-on-year growth in Q2 and a 24% YoY increase in revenues during the first half of 2017. 91% of total revenues come from Search and Portal. This division grew 22% YoY in Q2, therefore protecting solid figures for the company as a whole. In addition, the settlement with Google (GOOG, GOOGL) will protect Yandex from losing significant market share. During the earnings call, COO Alexander Shulgin said the results of the settlement, such as a choice screen in the Chrome browser on Android devices, may have a positive impact on Yandex's mobile search share. Next to Search and Portal, the other segments showed healthy YoY growth in Q2 as well, although the E-commerce segment, or Yandex.Market, lagged with 9% YoY growth (more on that later).However, taking a closer look, the Q2 numbers look less spectacular for some segments, most notably Yandex.Taxi. It's true that growth rates come down due to a base effect. And 46% higher revenues compared to last year is no bad feat. But, on a quarterly basis, growth was flat. Since quarterly growth in Q1 (3%) was already weak, the question arises whether the aggressive growth strategy is hurting the company's top line.During the earnings call, Yandex management stated that on a gross basis, revenues grew 190%. But due to (among others) minimum fare guarantees, the net number was much lower. Obviously, to acquire market share and to be viewed by the public as a real alternative to ""normal"" taxi services, Yandex.Taxi has to be aggressive at this stage. Nevertheless, this is the second quarter in a row that reported revenues are flattish, leading us to lower the estimates for 2018.As indicated in my previous article, revenues for Yandex.Taxi were projected to double to RUB 4.6 billion ($75 million*) this year. This no longer looks realistic, and we lower the estimate to RUB 3.5 billion ($55 million) (50% growth). Since Yandex.Taxi will be merged with Uber Russia into a new company called NewCo, we project revenues to reach RUB 5.1 billion ($85 million) in 2017 for NewCo. Keep in mind, Uber Russia is assessed to be roughly half the size of Yandex.Taxi. The pressure caused by fare guarantees may probably ease into 2018, so a 50% growth rate for 2018 is maintained. As a result, revenues for 2018 are estimated to come in at RUB 7.8 billion ($130 million). This is significantly lower than the previous estimate of RUB 10.5 billion ($175 million).The ride haul business is not the only segment that needs a fresh evaluation. As mentioned, Yandex.Market booked only 9% YoY revenue growth in Q2. This appears worse than it is, since the segment recorded EBITDA growth of 37% YoY growth. According to Yandex management, the company is able to increase the quality of traffic from Yandex.Market. Still, revenue growth of 17% in H1 2017 is distinctly lower than our projected full-year 2017 growth of 30%. Hence, the estimate for full-year 2017 is lowered to 20% (the 2018 estimate remains at 20%).The two smaller segments, Classifieds and Experiments, show little reason for concern. Revenue growth for Experiments even picked up to 125% YoY, from 76% in Q1. This leads to an upgrade to an expected growth rate of 100% for 2017 (previously, 75%). The Classifieds segment has developed in line with our estimates (48% revenue growth in Q2), therefore no change in projections is needed here.The impact of the revised projections should be viewed in perspective. No change in multiples* is needed, since market conditions remain favorable. More importantly, investors need to realize that Search and Portal remains the major factor in the sum-of-the-parts valuation. At $31.05 per share, the segment is over 75% of total value. With no changes in projections for this segment, only a dramatic revision in estimates for other segments can cause an impact. The graph below shows that the valuation for NewCo is revised downwards by roughly 25%. However, this only lowers the total value for Yandex by 3%.The lower valuation for Yandex.Market and notch-higher valuation for Experiments have a marginal impact. At the bottom line, the total sum-of-the-parts value per share comes in at a revised $38.55  (from $39.78).To conclude, the lower valuation for NewCo doesn't hurt the investment thesis for Yandex. Sure, for the near term the revision implicates that the dependency on Search and Portal will remain. But with the high growth rate for the core business, investors shouldn't be concerned about this. As outlined earlier, the settlement with Google may support market share for the Yandex search engine. That means the weakness in the share price following the Q2 results could be temporary and offers long-term investors an attractive opportunity. Despite the lower valuation, significant upside for shares of Yandex remains.*The numbers in this article are based on a USD/RUB exchange rate of 60. As described in previous articles, the Yandex parts are valued at a price/sales multiple of: 6 for Search and Portal, Classifieds and Experiments and 8 for NewCo (previously Yandex.Taxi) and Yandex.Market."

Therefore, budgeting your risk exposures can be critically important.Asset class diversification, process diversification, timing luck, ""internal dialogue,"" stop orders, and position sizing are just some risk budgeting concepts to consider.Our regular participants offer specific trading ideas reflecting contrasting styles (i.e. process diversification).","The Stock Exchange is all about trading. Each week we do the following:We also have some fun. We welcome comments, links, and ideas to help us improve this resource for traders. If you have some ideas, please join in!Our previous Stock Exchange asked the question: Are You A Contrarian Trend Follower? After explaining that there is such a thing as a contrarian trend follower (as contradictory as it may sound), we considered how it can work strongly in your favor. A glance at your news feed will show that the key points remain relevant.According to an excellent article by Peter Way (The Wall Street Poker Table), playing the market is neither an art nor a science, but rather similar to a game of poker where the results depend, in part, on other players' actions that are out of your control. Peter explains one thing that is certain, however, is an occasional loss. No one wins every hand of poker, and no one wins every trade. The question for market participants, is how will you allocate your risk budget? If time is a high cost for you, then you might consider a passive strategy instead of an active one.And if you are going to consider an active strategy, then there are lots of ways to allocate your trading risk budget. For example, Corey Hoffstein does an excellent job of explaining three categories of how traders may spend their risk budget in this article:Corey explains the “What” is asset diversification. Specifically, what asset class are you going to invest in? Stocks?... bonds?... tulips? The “How” is process diversification. For example, are you going to make decisions based on value or momentum? (Corey shares data on the attractiveness of momentum/trend following strategies). And the “When” is “timing luck.” At first, the word luck may sound unimpressive. However, it’s actually quite insightful, in our view, because it deals with the important (but often overlooked) concept of “what opportunities is the market providing at the time of rebalancing?” Very astute concept by Corey.Further still, another useful concept when considering your trading risk budget is the importance of listening to your “internal dialogue” (i.e. “the self-talk that we engage in throughout our waking hours”). As usual, Dr. Brett Steenbarger’s article on internal dialogue is both fascinating and practical:Of course “position sizing” and “knowing when to cut your losses” are two additional very important risk budgeting concepts to consider. In addition to position sizing and dynamic stop orders, our models also diversify across trading processes and “timing luck,” to name just a few.Per reader feedback, we’re continuing to share the performance of our trading models.We find that blending a trend-following/momentum model (Athena) with a mean reversion/dip-buying model (Holmes) provides two strategies, effective in their own right, that are not correlated with each other or with the overall market. By combining the two, we can get more diversity, lower risk, and a smoother string of returns.And for these reasons, I am changing the “Trade with Jeff” offer at Seeking Alpha to include a 50-50 split between Holmes and Athena. Current participants have already agreed to this. Since our costs on Athena are lower, we have also lowered the fees for the combination.If you have been thinking about giving it a try, click through at the bottom of this post for more information. Also, readers are invited to write to main at newarc dot com for our free, brief description of how we created the Stock Exchange models.This week’s Stock Exchange is being edited by Blue Harbinger; (Blue Harbinger is a source for independent investment ideas).Holmes: This week I like Yandex (YNDX). It is an Internet search engine out of Russia.Blue Harbinger: Interesting Holmes. Russia has been an important topic in the news lately for multiple reasons. Why do you like Yandex?Holmes: Well as you know, I am a contrarian. And based on the following chart, you can see Yandex is providing quite a dip-buying opportunity.BH: Yes, I see the obvious dip, but that is certainly driven, in-part, by the news. I realize that Yandex’s revenues have been increasing dramatically in recent years, but aren’t you just a little bit nervous about the geopolitics?Holmes: I am a trading model, not a person. So no - I am not “nervous.” I typically hold my positions for about 6 weeks, and I generally exit when my price target is achieved.BH: I have to admit, this is a tempting trade Holmes, and I appreciate you bringing it to my attention. However, unlike you - I am a human, and even though Yandex appears to be a healthy growing company, my nerves just won’t let me pull the trigger. I’ll be watching this trade closely.Holmes: Objectively speaking, you’ll likely be sitting on the sidelines while I generate attractive profits. Anyway, how about you, Road Runner - any trades this week?Road Runner: Yes, this week I like Burlington Stores (BURL). Ever heard of it?BH: Yes - it’s the old Burlington Coat Factory. I’m surprised you’re even considering a brick-and-mortar retailer. Apparently, you trading models don’t watch the news because if you did you might be afraid that the Internet (e.g. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)) is going to put all brick-and-mortar retailers out of business (and Holmes would be too concerned to even consider Yandex). Nonetheless, why do you like Burlington Stores, Road Runner?RR: I am a trend follower, and I typically like to hold stocks for about 4 weeks. Check out the following chart, Burlington has some serious momentum.BH: Yes, Burlington has some momentum. And even though your chart only goes back about a month, this stock’s momentum has been continuing a lot longer than that - arguably since the start of 2016 (with a few relatively small pullbacks). This is so shocking to me because most retailers are getting killed. However, if I look at the financials, revenues are growing, net income is growing, and the balance sheet isn’t terrible. Plus, they beat earnings expectations last month, gross margin improved, comps improved, and guidance is strong. Here is a look at the Fast Graph.Road Runner: Thanks for the fundamentals, Blue Harbinger, but I am a trader, not an investor. I’ll be out of this trade in about 4 weeks, long before the long-term fundamental story plays out.BH: Thanks for sharing your Burlington trade, Road Runner. That retailer is an anomaly compared to the larger retail bloodbath narrative. Anyway, how about you, Felix - any trades this week.Felix: Yep - I sold my Alnylam Pharmaceuticals (ALNY) shares on April 4th. I bought them on February 16th, if you recall.BH: Looks like this one didn’t go exactly your way, but as Peter Way explained earlier in this report - you can’t win them all. And I’ll certainly cut you some slack considering your 6 and 12-month track record is very strong, as shown in the performance table earlier in this report. Why’d you sell.Felix: It hit one of our dynamic stop loss orders. You know, one of the whole “knowing when to cut your losses” thing that was mentioned earlier in this report when we were talking about “risk budgets.”BH: Got it, Felix. Thanks for sharing. Do you have anything else for us.Felix: Yes, here is a ranking of my top 20 stocks in the High Liquidity S&P Midcap.BH: Interesting selection universe, Felix. Regardless, I like to know what you are “thinking,” so thanks for sharing these ideas. And how about you, Athena - any trades this week?Athena: Yes. This week I bought Twitter (TWTR) on April 9th. If you recall, I previously bought these shares during the week of February 22nd, I sold them in March, and I am rebuying them now at a lower price. What can I say - I am a trader. Here is a look at the charts.BH: It looks like you did alright with this one the last time around. Why do you like Twitter though?Athena: Because, simply stated, I am a momentum trader. On average, I hold my positions for around 17 weeks, but I generally exit when my price target is hit or when my stops get activated.BH: Okay. Well I’m not sure if I like that CEO, Jack Dorsey, splits his time between Twitter and Square (SQ). Seems like an odd arrangement, and I question his focus. Seems like both positions require more time than he is giving. Anyway, how about you, Oscar - any trades?Oscar: No trades to share, but I do have a ranking to share. The following table includes my top 20 ETFs from my comprehensive and diverse ETFs universe.BH: Thanks for sharing, Oscar. I enjoy these rankings. Your ETF momentum style is interesting to me, especially considering you rotate to a new ETF every 6 weeks, on average.In poker, no one wins every hand; and in trading, no one wins every trade. The key is to make more money on your winners than you lose on your losers. One way to improve your chances, or at least limit your losses, is the concept of “risk budgeting.” There are multiple ways to think about risk, and to budget your risk exposures. For example, we like to employ process diversification (across trend-following and dip-buying), position sizing, and knowing when to cut losses (stops), to name just a few. How do you budget your risk exposures?Each week, Felix and Oscar host a poker game for some of their friends.

Yandex, Uber and NewCo's shares in ownership are 59.3%, 36.6% and 4.1%, respectively.Key success factors for NewCo are expansion on the new territories and enlargement of a car fleet.Yandex and Uber have an opportunity to increase their overall share on the Russian market from 10% up to 16%.We expect further consolidation of the leading market vendors both from online and offline segments.","Yandex NV (NASDAQ:YNDX) created significant growth prospects for the online taxi segment on the Russian market after its merger transaction with Uber (NYSE:UBER). The strategic alliance may help both companies to win the competition with Gett and particularly strong offline taxi services. In this article, we analyze deeply the possible results of the union for both companies.The current situation on the Russian online taxi market is characterized as a price war. We suppose the union of two leading companies may cause serious changes on the market. This deal is a result of changing of a global operating model for Uber. A strategic union with one of the local market vendors is much cheaper than an aggressive competition with strong players.The price war with Didi Chuxing (DIDI) on the Chinese market has already cost Uber more than $2 billion within 2 years. At that time, the main problem was also the competition with a stronger local company formed after the merger of two main online taxi services - Didi and Kuaidi. And now Uber prefers to save its footprint in Russia and CIS countries by forming an alliance with Yandex.There are some significant peculiarities which affected the deal:The most significant peculiarity of Russian online taxi market is its emergency. This fact supports its extremely high competitiveness. The main market players are fighting for new and current users. This leads to a price war. In such a case, companies have growing revenues with sustainably negative EBITDA:(Source: Q1 2017 Yandex NV's Report Supplementary Materials)Uber doesn't report its regional breakdown for revenues. But the overall company's operating loss was $2.8 billion with revenues of $6.5 billion (Source: Uber, Lifting Financial Veil, Says Sales Growth Outpaces Losses) in FY 2016. This was mainly driven by Uber's promotion on the emerging markets, such as Chinese and Russian markets, while the most profitable operating area for the company was the US.The main competitor of Yandex and Uber on the Russian market is Gett. The company doesn’t publish its financials. However, now the situation on the market may be characterized by rough estimates of the three companies' market shares:(Source)Yandex and Uber are top 2 players now, but Gett also has a significant share. The share of the three companies listed above is still very low (approximately 12%) on the overall taxi market. Hence, online taxi services in Russia have significant growth prospects.Yandex and Uber's union is a significant source of risk for Gett. It will be harder for the latter to compete with such a large player in conditions of price war. The merger transaction of Yandex and Uber is also an additional risk for offline taxi services. The most significant players here are RuTaxi (with approximately 1 million rides per day), Maxim (with 750 thousands rides) and Fasten (with 250 thousand rides). Their positions are still stable, but with the enlargement of NewCo's car fleet and the spread of fast internet access on the country's territories, it may be seriously disturbed. The continuing expansion of online services in Russia and CIS countries is highly probable.The agreement unites the businesses of Uber and Yandex in the online taxi segment. NewCo is a product of this union. It includes the infrastructure of Yandex and Uber and the UberEATS service. All applications continue to be available for users separately. The agreement concerns the union of the car fleet, business and data of Yandex and Uber. NewCo will operate in 126 cities from 6 countries with a total 190 million of addressable population. The union will establish a new company with a higher market share, calculated according to the number of rides and gross bookings:(Source: Yandex's presentation about the agreement with Uber)We analyzed deeply the current situation on the Russian online taxi market and compared it with the Chinese one. First, even before the merger with Uber, Didi Chuxing has practically become an invincible market leader:(Source: Caixin magazine)The key reason for these numbers was the Didi Dache and Kuaidi Dache merger, which made competing on the market impossible for Uber.We have formulated the possible general outcomes of a deal for the parties and for the market:(Source: Author's analysis)Market shares are calculated in accordance with the monthly number of rides.The period of a price war in the online taxi segment is coming to an end. It will be followed by a period of consolidation of the market leaders. Hence, we foresee significant future mergers on the Russian market.The geographical coverage of NewCo with its large car fleet will help to continue its expansion in Russia and the CIS countries. With an anticipated revenue growth and strengthen of NewCo's market position, it may see positive operating income in the near future.As a result of the merger, we are assuming the growth of NewCo's market share from the current 10% up to 16% by 2020 on the Russian market. If other market players become a part of the Yandex-Uber alliance, then the situation on the Chinese market will possibly repeat itself in Russia. It is a significant opportunity for current market players, especially Yandex, to have positive income in the long term."
4088261,91145,2017-07-17T18:59:56-04:00,"The merger of Uber Russia and Yandex.Taxi proves that Yandex is more than a ""Russian Google"".The new ride-haul combination NewCo will bring significant revenue growth, but margin improvement is unlikely.Although the valuation for Yandex is significantly higher now, the recent price jump may have other reasons.The sum of the parts valuation reveals plenty of upside.","Smart investors know for some time that Russian internet company Yandex (YNDX) is much more than just a Russian search engine. Nevertheless, as outlined in my previous articles, the market didn’t seem to appreciate the potential of Yandex’ other businesses, most notably neglecting the promising Yandex.Taxi business. Last week, that seems to have changed.On Thursday, July 13, Yandex and Uber announced that they will merge Uber’s Russia business with Yandex. Taxi (click here more details). Yandex’ shares popped and closed the day 16% higher. However, that means shares are now hovering close to my previous indicated sum of the parts valuation of $31.85 per share (click here for the detailed calculation). What to do now? Does the Uber deal bring enough additional upside to justify holding the shares or even to accumulate (additional) shares? Or is this a splendid exit opportunity?Optimistic valuation from NewCo managementAccording to the transaction presentation, NewCo (as the new Yandex.Taxi and Uber merger will be named) carries a post-money valuation of $3.7 billion. The company is a bit vague in how it got to this number. In the accompanying call, management indicated that the number is based on a combination of methodologies, such as sales and EBITDA multiples. To be frank, the number of $3.7 billion seems overly rich. Before the deal was announced, Yandex had a total market capitalization of $8.8 billion. Previously, we valued Yandex.Taxi at roughly $600 million. This is based on a price/sales multiple of 8. So, a closer look at the financials of the combination is required to see if the previous sum of the parts valuation should be adjusted. Important note: NewCo will be fully consolidated into Yandex.Uber Russia is roughly half the size of Yandex.Taxi. The annual run rate of rides stands at 134 million for Uber, and at 285 million for Yandex.Taxi. The gross bookings annual run rate stands at $566 million for Uber, compared to $1.0 billion for Yandex.Taxi. To be fair, these numbers don’t tell us anything about potential increases in revenue growth or profitability. We do know that Uber is far from being profitable (like Yandex.Taxi) and Uber Russia won’t be an exception. For the sake of convenience, we treat the fundamentals of Uber Russia similar to the numbers of Yandex.Taxi.No synergy yetSynergy is not a topic in this story. In the current business stage, pressure on financials comes from an aggressive growth strategy with huge marketing efforts. Management stated that it will continue to invest in both brands in Russia. That means there will be little relief on expenses. Under NewCo, brands won’t compete for each other’s market share. Still, both brands need to acquire a part of the market that is up for grabs. NewCo CEO Tigran Khudaverdyan stated that the company only has 5-6% of the total taxi market in Russia, which is believed to be worth $10 billion annually.A big advantage is that NewCo will have a presence in 127 cities, which is considerably more than Yandex.Taxi previously. This brings better insights on the scalability of the ride-haul services. Furthermore, there will be improvements in the user experience for drivers and riders. With less competition, NewCo can fully focus on product development. Ultimately, this may drive sales growth. But whether we can expect better margins in the near term, is questionable.Better numbers lead to higher valuationPreviously, we expected 2017 revenues for Yandex.Taxi to reach RUB 4.6 billion ($75 million). Estimating Uber Russia as roughly half the size of Yandex.Taxi, this year's revenues for NewCo could come in at approximately RUB 7 billion ($115 million). It's difficult to estimate figures for 2018. NewCo stated that rides in June grew 400% YoY. But we also know that the average ride has declined, so we can’t extrapolate from this number. Revenue growth for Yandex.Taxi stood at 75% YoY at the end of Q1. A slowdown into 2018 is probable (due to a base effect). Nevertheless, 50% growth in 2018 should be achievable. That indicates 2018 revenues of RUB 10.5 billion ($175 million). At a multiple of 8 (we remain cautious), NewCo could be valued at $1.4 billion, or approximately $4.30 per share.Yandex showed convincing Q1 figures indicating that revenue growth for the core business, Search and Portal, probably tops 20% for full 2017. However, it's overly optimistic to believe that the high growth rate continues in 2018. Nevertheless, 15% growth may be realistic. Although the numbers of Q1 show reason to remain confident, base effects cause a slowdown for other segments as well. For the sum of the parts valuation, we expect 20% revenue growth for Yandex.Market, 30% for Classifieds and 50% for Experiments.Combining all parts of Yandex, we arrive at a sum of the parts value per share of $39.78. That's well above the previous valuation, but keep in mind numbers for 2018 are being used this time. Only a modest part of the improved valuation is attributable to the Uber deal. As such, the recent price jump in Yandex shares can’t be explained solely from NewCo’s valuation. It’s more likely that the news on the Uber-deal finally made the market realize how valuable the ride-haul business is. From now on, all investors may treat Yandex far better than just ‘Russia’s Google’."

The company also offers a range of services, the most popular among which are Yandex.Taxi, Yandex.Market and Yandex.Maps. Yandex is often called ""the Russian Google"". Despite its diverse areas of activity, Internet advertising is accountable for more than 95% of Yandex's revenue.Source: ir.yandex.comRUSSIA MEDIA ADVERTISING TRENDSThe introduction of anti-Russian sanctions in 2014, as well as the collapse of oil prices, have led to a GDP decline in 2015 by 2.8%, according to the official figures. Due to the high sensitivity of advertising budgets to the economic factors, the advertising market in Russia declined by 10% YOY in 2015. The only sector that avoided the decline was Internet advertising. In 2016, the Russian advertising market grew by 11.5% YOY, completely offsetting the fall of the previous year. At that, the segment of online advertising increased by 21% YOY - almost twice faster than the market.The fact that Russian companies did not reduce their online advertising costs in a down economy shows high immunity of internet advertising segment to a slower growth in the future.It should be noted that the changes in the structure of the Russian advertising market also play in favor of Internet advertising. The main driver for these changes is the numerical growth of young, economically active part of the population, which prefers the Internet to the traditional media. Online advertising also allows direct interaction with the customer, which is preferable for an advertiser.Thus, according to The Association of Communication Agencies of Russia (ACAR), in 2013, TV advertising accounted for almost 50% of the total advertising market in Russia. Already by 2016, the share of TV advertising decreased to 41.9%, while the share of Internet advertising rose to 37.8%. I expect that this trend will continue in the future, and the shares of TV and Internet advertising in Russia will equal already by the end of this year.As I've already mentioned, the advertising budgets are sensitive to the economic factors. From this perspective, the Russian advertising market is already starting to feel the tailwind.According to the official figures published on April 18, in Q4 the Russian GDP grew by 0.3% YOY in constant prices, marking the end of almost two-year long series of the negative quarterly growth rates of the GDP. Moreover, the current base forecast of the Ministry of Finance assumes the growth of the GDP at the level of 3%-3.5% at year-end.The independent studies also confirm the improvement of the economic situation in Russia.In late February, Moody's changed its forecast on Russian sovereign rating from ""negative"" to ""stable"", though leaving the government bond rating at Ba1.For eight consecutive months, the Markit Russia Manufacturing PMI ® has been above 50 points, indicating a continuing growth of the manufacturing industry in Russia. The March studies documented an increase in production volumes and expanded backlogs of work, as well as the reduced number of ready orders. The level of the business optimism has far exceeded the five-year average.Markit studies reflect a similar situation in Russia's service sector. The growth of new and unfinished orders amid the shortage of production capacity speaks volumes. The study participants noted the growing consumer demand, and the degree of optimism has almost reached two-year highs.BOTTOM LINE:The Russian Internet advertising market has demonstrated resilience in the face of the shrinking economy and will accelerate growth amid the increased economic activity in Russia. The transformation of the Russian advertising market reflected in the stable growth of Internet advertising segment is definitely a tailwind. I proceed from the assumption that in the next two years the volume of the Russian Internet advertising market will reach 195 billion RUB (CAGR 18.6%).POSITION OF YANDEX IN RUSSIAN SEARCH ENGINE MARKETThe effectiveness and popularity of Yandex as a search engine substantially determine the company's results.In the search market of Russia, without taking into account the small local companies (mail.ru and liveinternet.ru), a key competitor of Yandex is Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). And we have to admit that, until recently, Yandex was losing this competition.Over the period from 2014, the share of Yandex in the search queries on the territory of the Russian Federation has decreased from 54% to 49%. The share of Google has increased by almost the same percentage over the mentioned period. Although, it is worth noting that over the last two months, the shares of Google and Yandex have remained without change.In order to predict how the situation will change in the future, we should take into account the specifics of the Russian Internet.According to the most recent data, 73% of Russian population has access to the Internet. This is 23% higher than the average global level, and it is unlikely to change drastically in the future.At that, the mobile share of the Internet traffic in Russia is only 16%, with an average global level of 50%.This situation determines the high potential for further growth of mobile Internet in Russia. Therefore, the future success of Yandex is determined by the degree of the company's adaptation to this process.The most popular mobile operating system in Russia is Android (60.30%) followed by iOs (35.57%).In the meantime, the proportion of Yandex as a search engine on these two mobile operating systems has been steadily declining in favor of Google for the past three years. However, there is a reason to believe that the situation will at least not deteriorate for Yandex in the next six years.In 2015, Yandex filed a lawsuit against Google in the Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia accusing Google of abusing its dominant position in the market of pre-installed Android applications. In fact, Google dictated its terms to the manufacturers of mobile devices based on the Android OS forcing them to install Google search engine by default.After two years of litigation, on April 17, Google agreed to conclude a settlement agreement abandoning the pre-installation of its applications on Android mobile devices on the territory of Russia. The agreement will be valid for six years and nine months.In other words, Yandex has made it possible for the Russian mobile users to choose which search engine to use by default.This legal victory of Yandex will probably not lead to a sharp rise in its share of mobile search queries because the user preferences in favor of Google already exist, but at least the share of mobile search queries committed through Yandex will no longer shrink.BOTTOM LINE:Yandex has achieved the ability to compete with Google in the fight for a share of the Russian mobile search market. Given the prospects of this market, this victory is a positive driver of the company's revenue growth.THE INFLUENCE OF THE RUBLE ON THE EBITDA OF YANDEXA substantial share of Yandex's operational expenses is denominated in dollars. First of all, it is the rental costs of the company's central office. The wages of the key IT staff are also pegged to the U.S. dollar since Yandex is forced to maintain the international standards. Also, almost 100% of Yandex's CAPEX is denominated in the USD since the major part of them is associated with the acquisition of foreign data centers.These factors led to a decline in the EBITDA margin of Yandex, witnessed over the past two years amid the reducing international value of the ruble.Given the nature of the Russian economy whose main export commodity is oil, the ruble is highly dependent on oil prices.I proceed from the assumption that OPEC's efforts to stabilize the global oil market will eventually achieve its goals and lead to a gradual reduction of oil stocks in the OECD countries to the four-year average. It will drive the growth of the average Brent price to the level of $70.This, in turn, will lead to a gradual decrease in the average exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the level of 50 rubles.BOTTOM LINE:The probable oil market stabilization followed by the strengthening of the ruble exchange rate will have a favorable impact on the EBITDA margin of Yandex in the future.VALUATIONEvaluating the growth potential of Yandex's shares I used DCF model and compared international peer EV/EBITDA and P/S multipliers. Both approaches have identified the potential for the growth of capitalization of the company.Building a DCF model for Yandex, I've used the following assumptions:Based on my assumptions, Yandex's DCF-based target price could end up at a level of $29.2 per share, offering 26.71% upside.The DCF valuation data is very sensitive to WACC and USD/RUB rate assumptions. Therefore, for the convenience of investors, I provide a valuation sensitivity table:Evaluating the growth potential through the multipliers, it would be correct to compare Yandex with the U.S. Alphabet and the Chinese Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) because the business models of these companies have a lot in common.The listed companies operate in different countries with different levels of inflation and interest rates, and also differ in the national specifics of conducting accounting policies. In addition, the companies are characterized by different levels of debt load. In such circumstances, the most appropriate comparison would be through EV/EBITDA and P/S multipliers.YNDX EV to EBITDA (Forward) data by YChartsYNDX PS Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsI believe that in this case, DCF valuation is more acceptable because the limited number of analog companies do not let to compare the multipliers effectively. However, it is gratifying to note that both approaches have identified the growth potential of Yandex's shares.RISKSThe company is facing some significant risks.CONCLUSIONDespite the risks traditionally inherent in the Russian economy, the current price of Yandex's shares makes the purchase potentially attractive, which follows from the analysis of both external background and internal potential of the company."
4088098,102762,2017-07-17T10:39:38-04:00,Russian internet company Yandex is combining its Taxi segment with Uber.Yandex will own 59.3% in the NewCo.The collaboration will be beneficial for both companies.,"On July 13, Yandex (YNDX), the Russian internet company, revealed it would combine with Uber (UBER) its Taxi business into the entity NewCo. As a result of the transaction, a new company will be established, with an estimated post-money valuation of $3.725 billion. It is stated Yandex will own 59.3% of the NewCo, while 36.6% will be owned by Uber. The reaction of the market was more than positive: The stock price of Yandex soared from about $27 on July 12 to more than $31 the next day. (Source: Graphiq.com)The main aim of the deal is to increase the efficiency of operations and cut costs. Thus, it is claimed by Yandex the merger with Uber will increase vehicle utilization, enhance network effect and lead to faster pick-up times. Moreover, both sides will have better capabilities in R&D, as Yandex and Uber have “high-quality technical expertise” in the markets they operate in.The addressable market is hugeAs for the market for the taxi business, the new company will cover significant territory with its operations. It is stated the ridesharing businesses will be combined in Russia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan and Belarus, and include 127 cities. Therefore, the addressable population will amount to a hefty 190 million people, with a possibility for Yandex to offer other services in collaboration with Uber in the future. These include UberEATS and an option to “deploy the ride-sharing platform into logistics solutions markets in the future.” As a result, both players are likely to gain from the deal significantly.Moreover, it is important to note that the deal, if executed, will mean that two of the three major Russian taxi aggregators (Yandex.Taxi, Uber, and Gett) will combine their businesses. It is reported (the link is in Russian), in 2016, Uber and Yandex.Taxi managed about 700,000 rides a day only in Russia, compared with about 150,000 managed by Gett. In June 2017, the gross bookings annual run-rate of Yandex.Taxi and Uber amounted to more than $1.5 billion. As a result, the competitive strength of the new company will be enormous. However, from here a monopoly risk emerges. Thus, it is claimed (the link is in Russian) that Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service had not received any application regarding the merger. Igor Artemiev, the head of the Service, noted there can be a competition issue if the two main aggregators merge. What is it important for YandexClearly, the Taxi business is not a primary source of revenue for internet giant Yandex, since almost 92% of income is attributed to search and portal. However, it is important to note the pace of growth is impressive: in 2014, only 0.6% of income was from Taxi, in 2015 the number was 1.6%, in 2016 3% of revenue was attributed to Yandex.Taxi. In the first quarter of 2017, Taxi revenue amounted to 778 million rubles (or about $13.2 million), demonstrating 75% increase year over year.(Revenues attributable to the Taxi segment; Source: Annual report)Moreover, the collaboration with Uber opens many promising possibilities for Yandex. First of all, it means the corporation will have access to the UberEATS infrastructure, which is a new market for the company. Therefore, it can be expected Yandex will offer food delivery services in the near future, which can potentially become a sound source of income.Secondly, Yandex claimed in the statement the deal provides an opportunity to implement the combined ride-sharing platform in the logistics market. This can become a huge step for the company, as the Russian logistics and transportation industry is considered to be the least developed in Europe, providing an ability for new players to appear with innovative solutions. In addition, the NewCo’s platform of Yandex and Uber is likely to be based on Yandex’s mapping and navigation technologies. Among other benefits, this will open avenues for Yandex to have more car data for developing its self-driving solution. Thus, in May 2017, Yandex showed its first self-driving vehicle prototype developed by Yandex.Taxi and based on a Nvidia GPU. Yandex.Taxi Head of PR Vladimir Isaev explained to TechCrunch:ConclusionOverall, the merger of Uber and Yandex.Taxi is going to be beneficial for both companies. As the NewCo will account for more than 70% of the ride-on-demand market, the advantage of the monopolistic position will appear once the deal is executed. Additionally, it can be expected the costs of operations are going to decrease as the combined platform will grant enhanced efficiency and economy of scale. The deal will also provide an opportunity for Yandex to enter the food delivery segment and implement the combined platform in logistics. Moreover, applying Yandex’s mapping and navigation will allow the corporation to have more data for developing its self-driving solution, thus enabling Yandex to become an autonomous-driving player in Russia and neighbor countries."
4047591,92456,2017-02-20T12:32:47-05:00,"The dollar revenue of Yandex rose by 46.9% YOY in Q4 2016, thanks to the strengthened ruble.Investments in Yandex.Taxi reduce the overall profitability.In my opinion, the shares start to look a little bit too expensive.","I warned that Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) would show good results, but, frankly speaking, I expected more.Yandex's revenue in Q4 2016 amounted to 22.119 billion rubles, increasing by 22.2% YOY. In general, revenue rose by 26.98% over 2016 while the initial guidance of the management assumed growth in the range of 12% to 18%.Revenue in dollars grew by a record 46.9% YOY, reaching $364.7 million. This indicator is already comparable with quarterly results of 2013, i.e. before the introduction of anti-Russian sanctions, collapse of the ruble, and decline of the Russian economy.However, it should be noted that in the Q4 2016 financial statements, the dollar was 60.65 rub, while in Q4 2015, it was already 72.87 rub. As you can see, Yandex partly owes its good quarter results to the strengthened ruble. Given the low likelihood of further strengthening of the ruble, in the future, you should not rely on the high growth rates of Yandex's dollar revenue.There is a clear trend towards increasing the share of both Yandex.Taxi and e-commerce segments in the structure of Yandex's revenue. In my opinion, this is a good thing, because it means gradually increasing differentiation among the sources of the company's revenue.Nevertheless, online advertising, being the main source of the company's income, provides more than 90% of the revenue, and, in my opinion, it causes some issues.Firstly, I am confused with the dynamics of the number of Yandex paid ad clicks.With the growth of mobile Internet, ads become cheaper, but the number of their demonstrations, and, consequently, paid clicks should increase. In Q4 2016, Yandex's paid clicks growth amounted to 8% YOY, which was the worst result for the entire observation period. The dynamics of this indicator clearly disagrees with the overall market trend.For comparison, I will give a similar Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) statistics, the dynamics of which objectively show better results in terms of paid clicks growth:Secondly, we should not forget that Yandex is slowly but steadily losing the share of the Russia's search market, both in the general and mobile segment. By the way, Alexander Shulgin, Yandex's COO, during the conference call on the quarterly results acknowledged that, by the moment, the legal confrontation with Google in this aspect has not produced the desired result:Thanks to entering the new markets, the quarter was successful for Yandex.Taxi in terms of revenue growth. The revenues of this segment in Q4 2016 grew by 90.6% YOY while adjusted EBITDA margin deteriorated almost twice over the same quarter.Management still sees great prospects for the development of Yandex.Taxi despite fierce competition from Uber. In my opinion, this means that Yandex.Taxi will not be profitable for quite some time.In general, adjusted EBITDA margin decreased in Q4 2016, primarily because of the ongoing active investments in infrastructure of both Yandex.Taxi and e-commerce.It is interesting to note that Greg Abovsky, the company's CFO, during the conference call confirmed the rumors that Yandex was considering alternative, more favorable real estate leasing terms for its headquarters in Moscow:Speaking about the relative value of Yandex's shares, I would like to note that, in my opinion, they are becoming a bit too expensive.The value of Yandex's P/S multiplier currently exceeds that of Google and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and is one of the biggest in the Russian stock market.Assessing the value of Yandex's shares with EV/EBITDA (which is well suited for comparing companies from different countries), it should be noted that it is already approaching the value of Facebook's (NASDAQ:FB) shares and is 40% higher than that of Google. In this case, as I've already mentioned, one should not expect growth in Yandex's profitability in the near future.ConclusionOver the past three months, the shares have shown almost 40% yield, which justifies all the improvements we saw in the quarterly report. In my opinion, in the nearest quarter, Yandex's shares will not exceed $27."
4075761,102875,2017-05-23T14:03:51-04:00,"Last week, Ukrainian government applied sanctions for the most popular Russian tech companies, including Yandex.According to Yandex statistics, it has around 11 million monthly active users from Ukraine.The loss of 11M MAU will reflect the company’s forecast for the upcoming quarters and it’s unlikely that it will achieve its current financial goals in the near term.We’re short Yandex.","Last Wednesday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko signed the National Security and Defense Council decision to apply sanctions to more than 400 companies and 1200 Russian residents, who have deep connections to Russian government and work closely with their representatives. Ukrainian government started to impose sanctions against Russians back in 2014, after the annexation of Crimea, and along with European Union, renews them each year.The latest sanctions list includes companies like Vkontakte, Mail.ru Group, Odnoklassniki and Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), which considered Ukraine as its second biggest market after Russia. While most of the companies don't trade publicly on the American stock exchanges, Yandex is the exception, and the loss of Ukrainian market could be catastrophic for the company and have a direct influence on the price of its stock. From the chart below, we could see that its shares took a direct hit on Thursday and currently are slowly recovering to its last week highs:Chart: Seeking AlphaIf you try to access Yandex services from Ukraine, here's the message that you'll receive from your internet provider:Source: Kyivstar internet providerIn its latest 20-K filling, just weeks before the sanctions were approved, Yandex said that the uncertainty in Ukraine will have direct effect on the company's business performance:Since the sanctions are already in place, it means that any company or person cannot have partnership relations with Yandex subsidiaries in Ukraine and all its assets will become useless over time. According to Yandex statistic, it has 11 million Ukrainian users that use its services on a monthly basis. It's also the second biggest search engine in the country after Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL), with 33% share of the market:Source: uawebOverall, Yandex has around 70 million monthly users, and the loss of 11 million of them means that the company is going to have problems delivering its financial forecast in the current quarter, and it will take long time, before it could replace those users with the new one. In addition, as Ukraine continues to integrate with the European Union markets, more and more western-based application will enter the market and continue to spread to other Eastern European countries, where Yandex has advantage. We could already see this happening, as the news also comes out at a time, when Yandex struggles to gain advantage on its other markets like Belarus and Kazakhstan, where Google continues to establish stronger presence, especially in the search space.From a financial standpoint, while Yandex improved its Q1 revenue, its net income continues to decline on an annual basis since 2014, when the Ukrainian crisis started, and except for Russia, it doesn't have any advantages or opportunities in foreign markets. Also, its cash reserves continue to decrease and its cash to debt ratio is now 1.33, while the WACC is still over 18%, and the loss of its second biggest market is going to increase the cost of debt.Source: gurufocusConclusionAs noted in Yandex's 20-F filing, Ukrainian sanctions will impact the company's overall business performance and will urge it to find new ways to increase the popularity of its services in other regions. The loss of 11 million active monthly users will reflect the company's forecast for the upcoming quarters, and it's unlikely that it will achieve its current financial goals in the foreseeable future.We opened our short position in Yandex after the Ukrainian sanctions were announced, and at the moment, we recommend to stay away from the Russian companies, as the European Union sanctions are also expected to be renewed for additional year later in June."
4047224,91145,2017-02-17T13:57:50-05:00,"Yandex revenue growth remains convincing, bottom line was a tad disappointing, but only at first sight.Stellar growth at Yandex.Taxi, but the aggressive growth hurts short-term profitability.More important: allocation of cash excess on the agenda of next board meetings, thus offering additional upside.","Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), the Russian internet company, offered a mixed bag of results on Thursday Feb. 16. Fourth quarter earnings came in well below analyst estimates. To facilitate the rapid development of high-growth segments, in particular Yandex.Taxi, additional investments were required in for example marketing and personnel. This compromised profitability, but certainly makes sense at this stage.Then again, revenues were significantly higher than expected. And although growth rates slowed down at the core business of Yandex, Search and Portal, it's clear that the company continues to grow at a fast pace. What's more important, its management understands that it's key to safeguard the quality of revenue growth. On that matter, it sacrificed growth at Yandex.Market during the needed shift to a take rate based model.Overall, the results and the provided details during the earnings call showed little reason to revise Yandex' growth and business case. However, one topic requires the attention of investors.It's noteworthy that Yandex ended the fourth quarter with RUB 63.0bn (USD 1.0bn**) in cash. Net of debt, there remains a more than decent sum of RUB 27.5bn (USD 455 million). With the company being profitable and macro conditions far more stable, how to allocate cash more efficiently is an obvious, and to be fair, returning question. So, it was analyst Vladimir Bespalov (VTB Capital) provoking Yandex' management to comment on this topic. It worked, and CFO Greg Abovsky made a couple of strong indications what Yandex intentions are. Interestingly, Mr. Abovsky started his answer with mentioning dividends as ""one of the options that we would consider."" Unsurprisingly, he continued with saying Yandex will direct cash to further investments in promising segments. But with adding that ""it's not unlikely for the Board of Directors to revisit that question sort of next board meeting or two"" we have a very strong indication that returning cash to shareholders in 2017 is a serious consideration.Of course, distributing dividends is not the only option. A one-off special dividend is possible as well. But this is a hardly convincing way to get long-term relationships with shareholders. A more flexible approach would be the launch of a buyback program. At the current stage, with fluctuations in quarterly revenues and flexibility required in the company's investment program, this option is preferable compared to the installment of a dividend policy.Determining the size of this potential buyback program is not easy and highly speculative at this stage. Nevertheless, an initial program of USD 250m seems feasible considering the net cash position of USD 455 million. At the current stock market price, this would imply repurchasing 10 million shares. That isn't awfully lot with roughly 322.6 million shares outstanding. However, it does have an impact, as we will see in a minute.As described in my previous articles, a way to determine the upside in shares of Yandex is the sum-of-the-parts approach. Since the business segments differ significantly, it's worthwhile to consider the segments on a standalone basis. Furthermore, with the rapid growth of Yandex.Taxi, a materially different business than the search and portal ""core business,"" different multiples should be used. As a result, the Yandex.Taxi segment is valued at a sales multiple of 8, whereas the other segments are valued at a multiple of 6 (see my previous articles on Yandex for more details).Compared to the calculation after the Q3 earnings, expectations didn't change materially. Although core business revenues came in higher, Yandex.Market showed less growth, with in the end little impact on the total value. However, since the segment Experiments almost doubled revenues to RUB 282m (USD 4.5m) in Q4, it starts to make sense to include this segment in the calculation. The relative improvement in EBITDA, although still negative at RUB 354m (USD 1.5m) in Q4, underlines this thought. Classifieds, with revenues of RUB 1.3bn (USD 20m*) in FY16 are worth to consider as well. It is difficult to estimate 2017 revenues of these segments. However, with 88% revenue growth for Experiments in 2016, even accelerating in Q4, a 75% growth for 2017 seems achievable. Classifieds saw accelerating growth in Q4 as well, leading to an estimated 40% growth in 2017. In essence, the type of business of Classifieds may be not that different from Yandex.Market, so a sales multiple of 6 seems prudent. It's hard to categorize Experiments, which includes Media Services, Yandex Data Factory, Discovery Services (incl. Zen) and Yandex Turkey. To be on the conservative side, a sales multiple of 6 is used here as well. That leads to a total sum-of-the-parts value of USD 30.89 per share.However, this is excluding the effects of a potential buyback program. If we indeed witness a buyback program of USD 250m, the SotP-value increases to approximately USD 31.85 per share. Compared to the Feb. 16 closing price, this offers an upside of 30%. True, expecting a buyback is highly speculative at this point. On the other end, even excluding this in the calculation, an upside of 25% remains.Notes: * At an average 2016 USD/RUB rate of 66.9770 ** At a Q4 USD/RUB rate of 63"

The company is steadily losing its search engine market's share and, having a relatively small staff and financial capacity, tries to compete on equal footing with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and UBER (Private:UBER) on the territory of Russia. However, at this particular moment, Yandex has proved to be very lucky - the price of its shares may rocket to $24 and above.Trump's victory had a very positive impact on the stock market of Russia. If the name of Hillary Clinton was associated with the tightening pressure on Russia, Trump, at least, will not strengthen the existing sanctions, and possibly would contribute to their weakening. Anyways, after Trump's victory announcement, Russian stock dollar index RTSI has increased by 6% and, from a technical point of view, will probably continue to rise in the near term.Needless to say that Yandex's shares strongly correlate with the entire Russian stock market. This relationship is clearly presented on the following graph:And when you try to predict Yandex's share price through the RTSI index, it turns out that the current actual share price of the company deviates from a projected level by more than the size of one standard deviation. Thus, we can conclude that Yandex is currently undervalued relative to the entire Russian stock market. This fact alone can add a couple of dollars to Yandex's share price.I've already covered in detail that Yandex is steadily losing the search engine market of Russia to Google. However, the trends of internal advertising market in Russia will not let Yandex to lose the pace of its revenue growth for some time.According to the Association of Communication Agencies of Russia, for the past three years, there has been a persistent increase in the share of Internet advertising in the advertising budgets of companies in Russia. According to the results of the past nine months of this year, almost 38% of advertising revenue has been spent on the Internet. This figure exceeded the TV advertising.It turns out that, according to ACAR, the Internet has become the biggest media in Russia in terms of advertising revenue. Of course, Yandex, as the largest national seller of Internet advertising, will benefit from this in the first place.ConclusionThus, the positive trend on the Russian stock market, as well as the increased Internet share in advertising budgets of the Russian companies, creates a favorable climate for the growth of Yandex's share prices.However, there is one small thing. Whether or not things in Russia will improve during Trump's presidency remains to be seen, but the fact that a further decline in oil prices will lead to a substantial weakening of the ruble is a sure thing. It is not favorable for Yandex since the rent the company pays, as well as the salaries of its key staff, is expressed in dollars. Hence, I'm expecting the growth of Yandex, provided that Brent oil price will not fall below $45 in the nearest future."
4033511,92456,2016-12-30T14:40:36-05:00,"The growth of business activity in Russia creates a favorable background for the business of Yandex.The observed strengthening of the ruble has a positive impact on the profitability of Yandex.Comparing to Google, Yandex shares are more expensive. However, they are not strongly overvalued either.","The end of 2016 proved to be rich in favorable news for the Russian stock market. The first one is the victory of Donald Trump and the associated hopes for the improvement in U.S.-Russian relations. The second one is the oil price at the level of $55+ due to the fact that OPEC members and some independent oil producers, including Russia, signed the agreement on cutting oil production. As a result, only over the past two months, the Russian stock dollar index RTSI grew by 14%. However, Yandex's (NASDAQ:YNDX) share price remained virtually the same over the mentioned period. In my opinion, at the moment, Yandex's shares clearly lag behind the dynamics of the entire Russian stock market, and this factor, at least, creates some support for the company's shares.All recent macroeconomic indicators point to the stabilisation of the Russian economy. For example, the December study of business activity, conducted by the Markit consulting company, indicates the Russia Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) has achieved its 69-month high. This is the best growth in Russian manufacturing industries since the beginning of 2011.Markit research also recorded the growth of business activity in the Russian service sector. In November, Markit Russia Services Business Activity Index rose to 54.7 p, which corresponds to the two-year maximum:It is noteworthy that, according to Markit, the increased buyers' activity is, among other things, due to the increased advertising expense. And according to the Russian Association of Communication Agencies, for the first three quarters of 2016, company expenses on Internet ads amounted to 24%, while, in general, the Russian advertising market grew by only 13%.I believe that, against the background of the rapid growth in business activity, observed in Russia in Q4, as well as the simultaneous growth in the Internet advertising segment in the budgets of the Russian companies, Yandex (the largest seller of Internet advertising in Russia) will be able to demonstrate revenue growth faster than the market.The next positive factor for Yandex is a marked strengthening of the ruble due to stabilization in oil prices.Despite the fact that Yandex operates in the Russian market, the company is forced to make sure the salaries of its IT professionals meet the international standards in dollar terms. The leasing costs alsoare expressed in U.S. dollars. Thus, the strengthening of the ruble will have a positive impact on the profitability of the company.A few words about the price of Yandex's shares.Let's compare the current share prices of Yandex and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Since these companies are operating in the same industry, but in different countries with different costs of capital, inflation rates, taxation and accounting policies, I believe the EV/EBITDA is the most appropriate ratio for comparison.YNDX EV to EBITDA (NYSE:TTM) data by YChartsAs you can see, the current value of this ratio is slightly higher for Yandex than for Google. This means, at least, that shares of Yandex are not cheap at the moment. However, I would like to re-emphasize that the strengthening of the ruble could potentially lead to EBITDA growth, which, all else being equal, will decrease EV/EBITDA value.Comparing the P/S ratios, we find out that, at the moment, shares of Yandex are only slightly more attractive than shares of Google. And, as I mentioned earlier, you can count on Yandex's revenue acceleration.YNDX PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsConclusionYandex will publish its financial statements for 4Q 2016 in February 2017, and I believe that the mentioned factors will help the results to surpass the market expectations. At least, I expect to see good revenue growth and improved profitability. Given that the current price level of Yandex's shares is average, you may want to consider buying them now as a short-term investment."
4016914,91145,2016-10-30T22:16:30-04:00,"Yandex beat market expectations with solid Q3 numbers.
        Yes, market share is dropping but better targeting and higher conversion support revenues.
        Yandex.Market continues to impress, adds a meaningful contribution to revenues.
        Yandex.Taxi adjusted EBITDA drops sharply, due to higher investments.
        An update to the previous sum-of-the-parts valuation is necessary, leading to an even higher valuation.","It's easy to get excited about Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX). It's Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), Uber and eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) (or maybe better: MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI)) combined, active in (potentially) emerging markets. True, growth has been hampered by weak economic conditions in Russia, but that doesn't prevent the company posting solid results. During the third quarter (Q3), Yandex recorded revenues of RUB 19.3 billion (USD 306 million*), up 25% Year-on-Year (YoY). This number was significantly higher than the market expected:Reported earnings per share topped estimates by a wide margin as well:That helped shares of Yandex recover some ground that was lost since I wrote my last piece that envisioned a ' sum of the part'-value of as much as USD 27. Unfortunately, Yandex didn't break the USD 23 resistance. In my view, we should the drop from that level see as a technical correction. As we can see in the graphs above, estimates actually improved during the recent months. This is also demonstrated by analysts' forecasts for the coming years.Investors could have been worried about a drop in market share for Yandex search engine. That Google doesn't seem to comply on the FAS-ruling, makes it difficult for Yandex to become the first option for mobile users. Currently, mobile searches are a shockingly low 30% of search traffic, compared to Google's 50-60%. Mobile market share for Yandex is 38%, according to COO Alexander Shulgin. He expects somewhat improvement in the next quarter, due to shipment of mobile devices that include Yandex apps at a more prominent position. The company continues to pursue new distribution deals, which is absolutely necessary to maintain or grow market share.Having said that, revenues from search and Portal increased a healthy 21% YoY in Q3. More important, adjusted EBITDA grew 24%. The company could increase adjusted EBITDA margin to 36%. Yandex succeeds in better ad targeting, resulting in increased conversion rates and higher number of paid clicks. Search and portal remains the biggest segment, with revenues totaling RUB 17.5bn (USD 278m).The second largest segment, Marketplace or Yandex.Market, had a strong quarter as well. Revenue growth reached 45% YoY, which is comparable to the rate during Q2 (46% YoY). With quarterly revenues of RUB 1,200m (USD 19m), this segment is becoming a meaningful contributor. Yandex put significant investments (through advertising and personnel) in Yandex.Market, which caused an 11% decline in adjusted EBITDA. But with a margin of 32%, the segment is contributing to a positive bottom-line.The same can't be said (yet) for Yandex.Taxi, where adjusted EBITDA dropped sharply to minus RUB 633m (USD 10m neg.). But this is also the result of increased investments that helped to spur revenues with 151% to RUB 587m (USD 9m). The company made an aggressive move in September by lowering tariffs in Moscow and guaranteeing minimum checks to taxi drivers. However, CFO Greg Abovsky stated that this had only a limited impact on Q3 results. Thus, we can expect continuing pressure on the results for Yandex.Taxi.On the other hand, Abovsky made a very interesting remark, stating that Yandex sees that its taxi-service 'is scalable and feasible in much smaller cities'. The ride-haul service is now available in 40 cities, with Kiev (Ukraine) being the latest addition. That's significantly up from 25 cities just a quarter ago. Also, the statement seems to indicate that monetization is moving more smoothly than initially anticipated. During the Q1 earnings call, CEO Abovsky said that 'only a handful' cities are being monetized. But it will probably take several quarters before we can see this in the figures, since Yandex will increase investments directed to Yandex.Taxi.The company stated that total CAPEX will amount roughly 15% of annual revenue. That would mean that Q4 CAPEX could come in at about RUB 4,400m (USD 70m), significantly up from RUB 2,761m (USD 44m) during Q3. The larger part of investments will be directed towards Yandex.Market and Yandex.Taxi, so margins stay compressed. Yandex will also build a new datacenter in Q4.If we look at the cash flows, an increase in CAPEX makes perfectly sense. Cash flows are expected to increase 32% to RUB 25,516m (USD 405m) this year. In addition, the company holds over USD 1.0bn in cash. Management indicated that it will continue to direct cash flow towards investments, but stressed that it also explores other possibilities, possibly even a dividend for shareholders.Now, does this all impact our valuation of Yandex? Yes, it does, since we were too conservative on Yandex core business (Search and Portal) and Yandex.Market (E-commerce). Search and Portal are likely to grow 22% this year and probably 20% next year. Last time, an annual growth rate of 20% was used for Yandex.Market, but the 45% during Q3 makes clear we should use a higher growth rate. However, I prefer to stay conservative and use a growth rate of 40% for Q4 and 30% for 2017, leading to 2016 revenues of RUB 4.8bn (USD 77m) and 2017 revenues of RUB 6.3bn (USD 100m).We maintain the 6 times sales multiple for Yandex core business. We use 8 times sales for Yandex.Market. For Yandex.Taxi, the significant drop in EBITDA forces us to be more conservative. A 10 times revenue seems out of place, since the next quarters will see a pick up in capex directed towards this segment and thus pressure on the bottom line. Therefore, albeit arbitrary, we now consider an 8 times sales ratio. That leads us to a 'sum-of-the-parts' valuation of no less than USD 29.91 per share.A value of USD 29.91 corresponds with a 2017 price/earnings-ratio of 33.1. At first sight, that seems a bit lofty, since Yandex trades most of the time at a P/E-ratio of 20-25 (forward earnings). Currently, shares are trading at 22 times 2017e EPS. However, as stated in my previous articles, I believe the market underappreciates the different segments and therefore, Yandex is significantly undervalued.The improved outlook, solid cash flows and a possibility of dividends in the future, make sure that Yandex remains an attractive play. After all, you get Google, Uber and eBay in one share!*Based on a USD/RUB-rate of 63."
4009445,92456,2016-09-30T13:37:55-04:00,Yandex is steadily losing the search market of Russia.The price war of Yandex.Taxi and Uber intensifies.OPEC’s decision to freeze oil production will support Russian stock market and Yandex’s shares.,"Russian search marketAlmost two years ago Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) filed a lawsuit to the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia against Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), accusing it of abusing its dominant position in Russia. The Federal Antimonopoly Service supported the claim, and Google's appeal was rejected. Did Yandex win? No!Since the beginning of 2016, Yandex's share of the Russian search market has decreased by 1.4%. At the same time, Google has increased its share by as much as 3%. Hence, according to earlier forecasts, the two companies will equalize their market shares by mid-2017.Source of data: liveinternet.ruIt is noteworthy that, despite the decision the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia to limit the actions of Google on the territory of the Russian Federation, Yandex's share of searches carried out via Android devices continues to fall - it has decreased by 1.6% during the current year, while Google has strengthened its position:Source of data: liveinternet.ruIt's even more significant that Yandex's share of searches carried out via iOS devices also continues to fall. For the current year, Yandex's share within this market segment has decreased by 0.8%, while Google's share has grown by 1.4%:Source of data: liveinternet.ruYandex is losing the war for the mobile search market to Google, and even the decision of the Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia will not help the company to regain its position - Russian users increasingly prefer Google for mobile searches.The growth rate of Yandex's Paid Clicks decreased to 13% YOY in Q2 comparing to 18% YOY in Q1. Given the above information, I expect further slowdown to 11% YOY in 3Q.Source of data: YandexYandex.Taxi vs. UberThe price war between Yandex.Taxi and Uber (Private:UBER) intensifies in Russia.On September 19, 2016, Yandex.Taxi reduced the minimum travel costs for all tariffs in Moscow. This caused an attempt of a large-scale boycott - the taxi drivers were ignoring orders received through Yandex.Taxi from 23 to 26 September.Yandex.Taxi also launched a discount campaign in Saint-Petersburg in September, a week after Uber started a similar campaign there.The real disposable income of the Russian population continues to fall at an accelerated pace.Source of data: Federal State Statistics Service of RussiaTherefore, it is hard to expect rapid growth of the Russian taxi services, due to the simple fact that people want to save money. And, given that Yandex have to compete with Uber, the profit from this business will long remain in the negative zone, worsening the overall financial results of the company.Yandex vs. OilThe dynamics of Yandex's shares is closely interrelated with the entire Russian stock market.I revised the key macroeconomic indicators of Russia in a series of articles, and the situation is rather pessimistic. But nevertheless, even foreign investors are actively investing in the Russian market.The reason for such optimism is the hope for stabilization of the energy market as a result of coordinated action of OPEC, and, judging by the outcome of the Algiers meeting, these expectations will probably prove correct.The stabilization of oil prices will strengthen the ruble and the whole Russian market, creating support for Yandex's shares.ConclusionYandex's quotes are now in the sideways trend, and there are reasons for it.On the one hand, the price of Yandex's shares is supported by the stabilization of the entire Russian stock market against the background of strengthening oil prices.On the other hand, Yandex is losing its position on the Russian search market, which has a negative impact on the revenue generated from the key direction of the company.Hence, I believe the share price will remain in the range of $20 - $22 at least until the publication of Q3 financial results."
4011523,92456,2016-10-11T15:43:10-04:00,The largest seller of TV advertising in Russia is considering to increase the prices for advertising by 12-15% in 2017.Internet advertising is the only form of advertising that has demonstrated growth in 2015 in Russia.The unfolding situation is potentially beneficial for Yandex.,"According to the information that has appeared in the Russian media, National Advertising Alliance, which is the largest national seller of TV advertising, is planning to increase the price for advertising services by 12-15% in 2017. This means that many advertisers in Russia will probably have to review their advertising budgets in favor of the internet advertising.A little background information.From June 2016, more than 75% of the Russian TV advertising market is controlled by one entity - the National Advertising Alliance. This company is founded by major Russian media holdings - All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, Chanel One Russia, Gazprom-media Holding and National Media Group.The important thing to know is that it is Alliance's initiative to raise prices for TV advertising in Russia.According to the Association of Communication Agencies of Russia, the total size of the Russian advertising market averaged 300 billion rubles in 2015 (roughly $ 4.7 billion at the average dollar exchange rate in Russia in 2015), with TV advertising accounting for almost 45% of the market.However, TV advertising expenditure declined by 14% YOY in 2015. Most likely, it is the permanently falling TV advertising revenues that force the National Advertising Alliance to raise prices.In the meantime, Russian advertisers are increasingly spending more money on online advertising. In fact, the only type of advertising, the revenues from which were growing in Russia in 2015, is online advertising.Source of data: ACARIn private comments, many Russian advertising agencies have called inadequate the planned increase of prices for TV advertising. They argue that the Russian economy has not visible improvements, and the 12-15% rise in prices is not economically justified, bearing in mind that the Central Bank expects 4% inflation by the end of 2017 in Russia.However, I would like to emphasize that the increase in prices for TV advertising in Russia is only in the planning stage, it is not yet a sure thing. Nevertheless, given that income from this type of advertising continue to fall, the mega seller of TV advertising, apparently, does not have another option. In addition, the fact that the National Advertising Alliance practically holds a monopoly position on the Russian TV market gives the possibility to make such decisions.This will encourage a part of advertisers to reconsider their preferences in favor of other forms of advertising, and, most likely, switch to the Internet advertising. Of course, Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), as the largest national seller of Internet advertising, would benefit greatly from such a scenario."
3996961,92456,2016-08-07T10:08:44-04:00,The search market remains the key source of Yandex’s revenue.Yandex’s share of the Russian search market has dropped by 1.1% in 2016.Yandex’s share of the Russian mobile search market has decreased by 0.9% in 2016.,"In his comments to the Q2 financial report of Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), Arkady Volozh, the company's Chief Executive Officer, said the following:It cannot be denied there are really good services among Yandex's products, the revenue from which demonstrates relatively high growth rates. However, in this post, I would like to draw attention to the segment that is currently generating the bulk of the company's revenues and will be generating it in the near future.The latest Yandex financial report is notable for the fact that for the first time it contains discrete financial information on the key activity areas of the company.Considering the dynamic pattern of these segments in the structure of the total revenue of Yandex, it can be concluded that there are no significant changes in the internal structure of the company's revenue.Over the last three quarters, the share of the ""Search and Portal"" segment consistently amounted to approximately 89%. In my opinion, given the current trend, this figure is unlikely to change substantially in the near future.Source of data: YandexAnalyzing the EBITDA margin of these segments, we also come to the conclusion that the main source of Yandex's revenue is ""Search and Portal"". Other segments show either a low or even negative level of profitability. Moreover, there is no tendency towards a change in this situation.Source of data: YandexThese findings are unlikely to surprise anyone - Yandex is, first and foremost, a search portal, and it is clear that the bulk of its revenue and profit is generated by contextual advertising. However, it is very important to understand that, despite the development of Yandex's adjacent services, it is the search market that provides the bulk of the company's revenue, and there is no reason to expect that the situation will change in the future. And I believe that this is what threatens the company.Until the end of 2015, in each quarterly report, Yandex published information about its share of the Russian search market. Interestingly, in the last two quarterly reports, Yandex ceased to publish this information. Why would that be? The study of the Yandex's search market share was based on the data presented on liveinternet.ru - the Russian internet portal. Having spent a lot of time on this, I was able to find some relevant information, which I have presented in the graph below. It reflects the latest changes in the positions of the key players of the Russian search market.As you can observe, the Yandex's share on the Russian search market has decreased from 50.2% to 49.1% from December 2015. Over the same period, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has increased its share from 42.5% to 44.1%.The trend of changes in both Yandex's and Google's shares of the Russian search market has obviously formed. Hence, we can forecast that in about a year these companies' market shares will be equal.Source of data: liveinternet.ruThe analysis of the mobile search market alone allows you to come to conclusions that are even more disappointing for Yandex. Over 2016, the gap between the companies has increased - Yandex's share has fallen by 0.9% and Google's share has increased by 1%.Source of data: liveinternet.ruYandex probably hopes that the restrictions imposed by FAS on the actions of Google in Russia will help the company to strengthen its position on the mobile market. However, I don't think it is possible. Generally, I believe that Yandex is late in defending its competitive rights - a substantial part of the mobile search market in Russia already belongs to Google. Moreover, even having a choice, it is unlikely that the users will start to massively replace Google with Yandex on their smartphones.Yandex is steadily losing its share of the search market in Russia, and I have no confidence that the development of other activity areas of the company will be able to promptly compensate for this in the near future."
3998784,92456,2016-08-11T11:35:29-04:00,Yandex has the price advantage on the Russian cloud market.Yandex’s cloud business is unlikely to face strong competition from foreign companies.The internal competition on the Russian cloud market is insignificant.,"A month earlier I outlined the intention of Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) to start activities on the Russian market of the cloud services. In this post I want to touch upon some additional aspects that allow me to assume it is indeed a promising direction for Yandex, which in the case of right actions of the company's management can significantly improve its sales figures and profitability.The official statement, accompanying the establishment of Yandex's subsidiary - Yandex Cloud Technologies, indicates that on the first stage the company will offer virtual servers based on the latest generation of Intel processors, which will store the data and implement cloud computing.It should be noted that Intel and Yandex partnership lasts for many years. I could not find the exact numbers in the Internet, but given that Yandex is the largest search and information portal in Russia, we can assume that it is the largest buyer of servers in Russia. Hence, it follows that surely Yandex enjoys a good discount, possibly 40% or even 50% of the average market level. Needless to say, Yandex can not resell the purchased servers, but it can successfully sell the access to them within the framework of the cloud-based business at a competitive price. With that, the company's profitability will remain at a fairly attractive level. The smaller players of the Russian cloud market are deprived of such a price advantage.It can be claimed that, for the same reasons, such ""monsters"" of the cloud market as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) can sell their services in Russia for even more competitive prices than Yandex. However, in this case, I believe that Google or Amazon will not be able to provide a tough competition to Yandex.Over the past few years, the Russian Government has been taking determined steps to protect the local information space. It is appropriate to recall the requirements to store the personal data on the territory of Russia, as well as recent amendments to the law on combating terrorism and extremism.The controlling stakes of major oil and gas companies and banks in Russia are owned by the State. Therefore, it is quite difficult for me to believe that, for example, Amazon or Google may be regarded as cloud services providers for the companies such as Gazprom or Lukoil. The preference will surely be given to Russian companies.Smaller and non-state-owned companies will also hesitate to use the cloud services of foreign suppliers. The prevailing trends in domestic and foreign policy of Russia do not allow to be sure that in the future the laws, further complicating the work of foreign IT companies in Russia, will not be adopted.""Rostelecom"", the company which in the recent years has also made large investments in the construction and modernization of its data centers, stands out from the domestic competitors of Yadex on the Russian cloud market.However, the expected growth rate of the Russian cloud market will probably allow the both companies to develop freely enough for several more years.ConclusionThus, the initial conditions for the development of Yandex on the Russian cloud market are quite favorable, and the market share the company will get now depends only on its actions."
3986933,92456,2016-07-07T12:00:47-04:00,"Yandex will provide IaaS solutions to Russian companies.According to the forecasts, the cloud market in Russia will double in the next three years.Current financial conditions will hardly allow Yandex to win market leadership rapidly.","In early May, Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) registered its new subsidiary - ""Yandex Cloud Technologies."" Within the framework of the new direction, Yandex intends to focus on providing IaaS solutions to Russian companies. This step is right and justified, but, in my opinion, it should not be overestimated.The Russian cloud-based services market, like the Chinese market, is developing with a certain time lag relative to advanced countries. The reason for this is, first of all, the market immaturity due to the poor understanding of the advantages of such solutions for business, revealed by the local company management. Secondly, there's a lack of serious players capable of providing stable high-quality services.The structure of the Russian cloud market is an evidence of its youth. According to DIRECTUM - the local consulting company, the demand for IaaS in Russia is substantially higher than for SaaS.Paradoxically, the financial difficulties in 2015 triggered the development of this industry in Russia. The depreciation of the ruble and budget cuts forced many companies to abandon development and maintenance of their own information infrastructures. As a result, the Russian cloud market grew by 25% in 2015, reaching 16.5 billion rubles. Moreover, it is anticipated that its volume will double by 2018, reaching 32 billion rubles.Dollarwise, these figures don't seem impressive at the current exchange rate. But the expected cloud market growth rate exceeds Yandex's current revenue growth rate, which makes the market entry potentially profitable for the company.Source of data: iKS-ConsultingThe legislative issue also could be a tailwind for Yandex. According to the law N152-FZ ""on personal data,"" all telecommunication companies providing their services in Russia shall store and process personal data on the country's citizens within the Russian Federation. This forces foreign players to use the services of the local data centers that do not always allow them to guarantee an adequate level of service. In addition, it reduces the profitability of the business.In general, it is worth noting that the Russian authorities' intention to increase the control over information may deter foreign companies from large investments in the Russian IT industry. Again, this is an advantage for Yandex.On the other hand, despite the correctness of the decision to provide cloud-based services, it is difficult to expect that Yandex will quickly take a significant share of this market. Cloud-based services require large and long-term capital investments, and the current financial condition of Yandex does not allow to rely on aggressive infusion of financial resources to this industry. The lion's share of computer equipment is purchased for dollars, and, given the weak prospects for the Russian ruble, the situation will not improve in the near future.I have no doubt that Yandex's decision to enter the Russian cloud market is a good one. On the other hand, I doubt this decision will dramatically improve the company's financial performance in the near future."
3993491,91145,2016-07-30T03:08:32-04:00,"Shares of search engine Yandex have been ranging the last couple of weeks.Solid earnings release gives new confidence, despite pressure on EBITDA.We should anticipate on a higher ‘sum-of-the-parts’ value.However, the chart shows us near-term resistance.","Investors rewarded the continuing growth story of Russian search engine company Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) with a year-to-date increase of 40%. That's a clear outperformance of the broader Russian market, with the leading VanEck Vectors Russia ETF (NYSEARCA:RSX) 'only' up 21.5% YTD. Still, during the last few weeks, shares of Yandex failed to move higher. Even the solid earnings release this Thursday couldn't inspire investors to move Yandex to fresh 2016 highs. So what is holding the stock back?Well, it is certainly not a lack of growth potential. As outlined in my previous article, Yandex.Taxi (a ridesharing service comparable to Uber and Lyft) is likely the main driver of the share price. During Q2-2016, revenues for this division grew at a rate of over 170% YoY, just like the previous quarter. A slowdown is not in sight. Speaking at the earnings call, CFO Greg Abovsky stressed that a lot of Yandex near-term efforts are geared towards expansion of this ridesharing service. Yandex.Taxi is now available in 25 Russian cities and in 3 cities of former Soviet states, with Almaty (Kazakhstan) being the newest dot on the map. However, the strong expansion of Yandex.Taxi comes at a price. Additional investments, mainly in marketing and advertising plus personnel, dragged down adjusted EBITDA.The pressure on EBITDA is acceptable considering aggressive growth policies. CFO Abovsky admitted that the service doesn't generate any meaningful revenues in newly added cities. Yandex.Taxi offers (potential) customers incentives to try its service and the service is launched with aggressive pricing. In addition, drivers are subsidized to quickly expand the network. This seems to pay off, since the increase number of rides outpaces the increase in revenues (although exact figures are not provided). All in all, there's no reason to adjust previous made assumptions that Yandex.Taxi could be worth $2.40 per share (based on 10 times 2017 revenues). However, these are expectations mentioned a couple of months ago and at a current price of $22.33 (as per close July 28), we need more to see significant upside.Evidently, Yandex is still an internet search company in its core. Its main segment, Search and Portals saw an 26% YoY increase in revenues to RUB 16.5bn ($253m) in Q2. Encouraging is that mobile monetization expanded 150 bps to 22% of total search revenues. Further improvement may come after the final FAS decision in the Google case. In the run up of this decision or possible settlement, scheduled on August 16 th, Yandex already struck a couple of deals with OEMS that gives Yandex apps a 'home plus or minus one' position on the screens of Android devices. COO Alexander Shulgin expects to moving up to the home-screen after a final decision by the FAS.Revenue growth came also on the back of better targeting in the ad network. COO Shulgin mentioned that the company still has ""some bullets"" (although no silver bullet) to improve targeting further. Yandex sees additional technological improvements in the second half of the year to continue this development. Yandex.Zen, rolled out in June, is an example of Yandex ability to increase revenues from better targeted advertising. Management said during the earnings call that the service already generates revenues.Also Yandex.Market shows decent performance, with revenues up 46% and an increase in take rates from 1 to 2%. But here as well, EBITDA suffered from aggressive marketing and new hiring.However, Yandex management offered an encouraging guidance on margin decline. Instead of previous guided 300bps decline, 200bps are now expected. Speaking of guidance, the company upped its guidance for full year revenue growth to a range of 19-22%, up from 15-19% during the last earnings call. To be fair, this indicates a slowdown compared to achieved growth of 40% YoY during the first six months of the year. Yandex is quite cautious on the current environment. It sees stabilization of macroeconomic conditions, but a return to growth is not anticipated for the Russian economy.All in all, the solid performance of the core business and improved guidance would warrant a higher value per share compared to three months ago. Against six times 2016 revenues, Search and Portal could be worth $19.21 (up from $18.51 three months ago) and even $22.08 based on 2017 revenues. Yandex.Market seems to be well on track to reach previously indicated annual revenues of RUB 5.0bn ($77m). Growth for next year will probably fall back due to a base effect, but should outpace Search & Portal. Nevertheless, to be conservative I use a growth rate of 20% for this segment in 2017. That gives us the following 'sum of the part' valuation:Also based on the price-earnings ratio, Yandex is certainly not expensive. In fact, due to higher analyst estimates, price-to-earnings ratios for farther away have improved, despite a 10% increase in Yandex share price during the recent 3 months. Using the PEG-ratio, which compares earnings growth with the price-earnings ratio, Yandex is attractively priced with a ratio of 1.3 for 2017. But the development in USD/RUB plays an important role.What are the risks for the company? First of all, the macroeconomic situation in Russia could spoil the party. Although oil and commodity prices have recovered from the lows early 2016, the recent decline in oil prices show that happy days haven't returned. Still, the Ruble has stabilized compared to earlier periods and is now in a range between USD/RUB 62.5-67.5.If Russia didn't cause enough geopolitical concerns, Yandex may feel some impact from the recent developments in Turkey. Context is required here, and Yandex' activities in Turkey are only modest. The segment Experiments, which contains Yandex Media Services, Yandex Data Factory, Discovery services (such as Yandex.Zen) and finally Yandex Turkey, reached Q2 revenues of RUB 153m ($2.4m). So exposure is likely to be less than RUB 100m ($1.5m) per quarter. During the earnings call, management acknowledged that Turkey is less of a priority right now and tries 'not to spend too much there"". However, this is not related to current tensions but more to harsh conditions when it comes to distribution of Yandex search queries.Recently, there was a bit of uncertainty related to the new data storage law that comes into play from July 1st, 2018. Contributor Oleh Kombaiev wrote an interesting article on this matter. All in all, many expect this law will likely hit telecom operators the most and internet companies only modestly. Also Yandex management said that due to the type of business, impact for Yandex and future CAPEX will be negligible.Investors should pay attention at what the chart is telling us. There seems to be some resistance around the $23 level. In fact, since early June, Yandex hit 3 highs at roughly the same level: $23.20 at June 8, $23.17 at July 12 and again $23.17 in the morning hours after the release of the Q2 earnings. The interesting point of this resistance level is that it matches with a 50% Fibonacci retracement of the June/July 2014 highs (see blue lines in the chart below) AND with a 38.2% retracement (see red lines). To be frank, this is not a bullish picture. However, it would be a very strong signal if the stock manages to break through this zone of resistance and set new 2016 highs.Concluding, Yandex's 'sum-of-the-parts' combined with strong fundamentals indicate that there's still further upside for its share price. However, uncertainty in the macro environment and a resistance zone could prevent Yandex moving higher in the near term. That being said, any weakness could offer a fresh entry point. The growth story of Yandex is far from over."
4035530,92456,2017-01-10T09:07:47-05:00,The share of Yandex in the Russian search market has stabilized at the level of 48%.. maybe this is only a short-term success of Yandex.The forecasted growth of Yandex’s share prices is rather based on external than internal factors.,"In my article dated December 30, I gave a positive forecast for Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), describing the external factors that were beneficial for the company: strengthening of the ruble, increased business activity and growth of the Internet advertising market in Russia. This time I would like to provide more detailed description of the company's internal trends, in order to better understand the real factors that influence the growth of the share prices.Despite the multifaceted company's activity, the key source of Yandex's revenue is the search engine business.It must be recognized that, although ""E-commerce"" and ""Yandex. Taxi"" segments are gradually increasing their shares in the structure of the company's gross income, their joint share in the company's revenue, according to Q3 results, was only 9%, while ""Search and Portal"" segment secured 88% of sales:Analyzing the sources of the company's profit using EBITDA, we get even more contrasting results: in Q3, the positive EBITDA was only generated by ""Search and Portal"" and ""E-commerce"" segments. The remaining segments gave zero or negative results.In other words, ""Search and Portal"" segment is not only accountable for the profit of the company, it also sponsors its unprofitable activities. It is also important to note that over the past year, the EBITDA of ""Yandex. Taxi"" fell from the profit of 44 million rubles to the loss of 633 million rubles, reflecting tough competition with UBER on the territory of Russia. As for the ""E-commerce"" segment, although EBITDA is positive, there are no growth trends - the profit remains at the level of 400 million rubles for already two years:So, it should be clearly understood that Yandex is first and foremost a search portal that makes profit on the Internet advertising. And, judging by the current trends, this situation is unlikely to change within the next year. This means that it is the popularity of Yandex as a search engine that will determine its financial results in the near future. It is both good and bad news for a potential investor.Over the past two years, the share of Yandex in the Russian search market decreased by 3.3%, while Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) share increased by 5.7% over the same period. The long-term trends suggest that the shares of Yandex and Google will become equal by June this year:However, over the past three months, the market shares of both Yandex and Google remained practically unchanged. This may be a short-term Yandex success in its fight against Google for the Russian search market, however, it is still very premature to talk about a longer-term change.There is another problem. Internet users gradually give preference to mobile gadgets, and this tendency is reflected in Russia as well as in the rest of the world. Unfortunately, Yandex lost the mobile search market to Google long ago. Moreover, the long-term trends still suggest that the gap continues to widen:Putting it all togetherSo, after all the above, again, as on December 30, I would like to make a positive forecast for Yandex's shares. Please note, however, that the expected increase in the Yandex's share price is only based on the improved external environment, as well as the local stabilization of Yandex on the Russian search market, which will probably allow Q4 results to surpass the analysts' expectations. Once these factors are reflected in the price, Yandex's quotes will return to the lateral trend."
3970404,91145,2016-05-02T22:18:57-04:00,"Yandex reports excellent results, topping estimates once more. But the information of interest was to be found in the details.Due to improved disclosure, we get more insight in Yandex.Taxi and other promising ventures.Yandex is on its way to become much more than a search engine, but is the market appreciating other segments as well?Even following a cautious approach, a ‘sum of the parts’ valuation shows that there’s still upside for shares of Yandex.","Last week, Russia's largest search engine company Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) published its first quarter results that were once more topping estimates. What's more, the company published an additional breakdown of its revenues, offering investors a lot more insight into divisional performances. As a result, we get to see where growth comes from. We finally get additional color on Yandex.Taxi and 'Experimental Business', such as Yandex Data Factory. As described in my previous article, these segments offer a lot of potential and should be closely watched by investors.Let's start with the basic figures. Yandex reported RUB 16.5 billion ($231m*) in revenues, an increase of 34%. EBITDA came in 62% higher compared to last year and reached RUB 5.8bn ($81m). Adjusted net income rose 41% YoY to RUB 3.2bn ($45m). These numbers were all above analyst estimations, despite net profit dropping 50% to RUB 1.1bn ($17m) due to a foreign currency loss. The company raised its outlook for revenue growth to 15-19 percent from a previous 12-18 percent. Although the currency loss reminds investors of Russian companies' pain, the higher-than-expected growth and raised forecast give a strong indication that conditions are improving and growth remains solid.During the earnings call, management supported this view of an improved environment and signaled that advertising budgets rose across all advertising categories. Real estate, auto, home and garden, apparel and FMCG were the best performers. Even the 'dog' travel managed to show an increase of 20%. Obviously a good sign for the search engine company, that still depends for 96.1 percent of revenues on advertising. RUB 15.8bn ($222m), or 94.6% relates to online advertising revenues, directly from Yandex websites or from its advertising network.Nevertheless, far more interesting information in the recent earnings release came from the breakdown in 'Other Revenues.' Though the activities listed under this line are still relatively small, the 132% YoY growth to RUB 641m ($9m) highlight that investors can't ignore these businesses.In particular, Yandex.Taxi should be on the radar of investors. Growth in Q1 accelerated 176% to revenues of RUB 445m ($6.2m). The Uber-like (NYSE:UBER) application is now available in 17 cities, including Minsk in Belarus. Interestingly, the company recently launched a corporate version and a 'ultra-low prices' express service (see picture left). One who is familiar with the infamous gypsy cabs in Russian cities will acknowledge the additional pool of drivers…The strong growth of Yandex.Taxi raises the question to what extent investors should value this particular business. After all, revenues could well reach RUB 2.5bn ($38m) this year and RUB 5bn ($77m) next year. With stories about Uber being valued at a whopping $62.5 billion in a $3.3 billion market in 2015, one could see the potential implications for the value of Yandex shares.The numbers above would suggest an Uber valuation of at least 15-20 times revenues. Translated to Yandex.Taxi, that would imply a value of $570-760m, or $1.78-2.38 per share. However, Yandex.Taxi is probably limited to Russia and other CIS markets for now, compared to a global reach for Uber, Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) and comparable names. Of course, Yandex.Taxi could also be rolled out to many other countries, but management's focus lies for now on the Russian and surrounding markets. Therefore, a valuation of 10-12 times revenues sounds more reasonable, leading to a value of $1.19-1.43. Obviously, certain valuation methods are arbitrary. Analysts from Deutsche Bank value Yandex.Taxi against 10 times 2017 revenues, which could suggest a valuation as high as $2.42 per share. Lower multiples are not really representative, since Yandex.Taxi currently undergoes enormous growth.Obviously, the above-described calculation can be done for other parts of the company as well, leading us to some form of 'sum of the parts' valuation. So what about the other segments outside the 'core business' Search and Portal? E-commerce, or online marketplace Yandex.Market, reported Q1 revenues of RUB 1.0bn ($14m), up 55% from last year. Let's make a rough estimate with 2016 revenues reaching RUB 5.0bn ($77m). Other online marketplaces, such as emerging markets peer MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), trade at price/sales ratios of 8.5. That would value Yandex.Market at $2.05 share. However, eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) trades at 4.5 times sales, which implies only $1.09 per Yandex share. A multiple near to MercadoLibre makes more sense, considering the market characteristics (rising internet penetration and the potential of the Russian eCommerce market).The other segments, such as Classifieds (Auto.ru, Yandex.Jobs etc.) and Experimental Businesses are considerably smaller. Nevertheless, Experimental Businesses, which includes Yandex Data Factory, showed a YoY growth of 87%. As a result, a closer look could be warranted. The problem is that Experimental Businesses includes a number of other businesses, which makes a translation to value per share at this point tricky.Now that we have estimated the value of Yandex.Taxi and Yandex.Market, we should make a rough estimate what Yandex core business should be worth. Earlier, we presented that advertising revenues reached RUB 15.8bn ($222m) in Q1 2016. However, there are some transaction results between all segments. Therefore, Yandex also presented revenues from Search and Portal, coming in at RUB 15.1bn ($213m). For full 2016, these revenues could come in at RUB 64bn ($985m). The question is which multiple we should use. Yandex peers, such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Yahoo (YHOO) or maybe better, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) all have valuations between 6-7 times sales. Valuating Yandex 'core' business at 6 times revenues, it should be worth USD 18.51 per share.As a result, the 'sum-of-the-parts' delivers us a conservative value per share of $18.51 + $1.43+ $1.09 = $20.79. Taking the more optimistic estimates, Yandex could be valued at as much as $22.94. Of additional note, Classifieds and the promising segment Experimental Businesses are not included in this calculation. In conclusi, the market doesn't seem to fully discount the value of the separate businesses. As a result, there's still plenty of upside for Yandex shares.*Earnings in USD are converted at an estimated average of USD/RUB 71.2 during Q1-2016. All other converted USD numbers are at USD/RUB 65."

Following the report, its revenue increased by 34% and it was 16.5 bln rubles; adjusted EBITDA increased by 62% - to 5.8 bln rubles and the EBITDA margin in the 1st quarter rose to 35% from 28.9% a year before. The adjusted net income increased by 41% - up to 3.2 billion rubles. The indicators of Yandex exceeded expectations, as analysts expected that the company's revenue in Q1 of 2016 would increase by 24.8%, adjusted EBITDA would grow by 31.8% and adjusted net income would increase by 17.5%.(Source: yandex.com)Personally, I think that we should expect further growth of these indicators. Why do I think so? According to the structure of the company's revenue, 98% is profit from Internet advertising, whereas contextual and media advertising is very popular and profitable in Russia. In addition, the revenue from e-commerce increased, in particular, receipts from services ""Yandex.Taxi"" rose by 176%, and from ""Yandex.Verticals"" (""Auto.ru,"" ""Yandex.Work"" etc.) increased by 35%. This means we should expect the development of new markets in this field and a consequent revenue increase.(Source: itunes)It should also be noted that in April, YNDX established ""Cloud technologies Yandex,"" which will purposefully be engaged in the development of Russian search engine cloud services (data warehouse Elliptics and PaaS-platform Cocaine). The development of cloud technologies will improve the functioning of ""Yandex.Store,"" ""Yandex.Market"" etc., which will increase the number of searches and bring more revenue from online advertising.Furthermore, the signal for buying its stocks is that the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Research raised the predictive value of Yandex's shares by 22%, from $18 to $22 per stock. The bank made this decision based on the company's financial results for the Q1 2016. Thus, it confirmed the ""BUY"" recommendation for these stocks.(Source: finviz.com)ConclusionDespite some economic problems in Russia, Yandex had a confident start in 2016. Taking this into account, the company has already raised its expectations as to its revenue for this year. Today, consumer activity is increasing, but people still prefer to economize, so they choose and compare products on the Internet, which, in turn, increases the number of searches, and raises Yandex's income from advertising.In my mind, a good and profitable year is awaiting Yandex and its shareholders. Do not miss the opportunity!"
3929946,92456,2016-02-25T13:24:12-05:00,Yandex loses the battle for the Russian search market to Google.The Rouble devaluation has a negative impact on Yandex profitability.Yandex growth rate in paid clicks is not encouraging.,"In my opinion, there are four main reasons to not invest in Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX).Russian search market shareYandex current share of Russian search market comes in at 57.3%. By comparison, Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) share is 35.2%. These numbers were retrieved from LiveInternet.ru, a local Russian Internet resource. According to this data, Yandex's market share dropped 1.7% in 2015, while Google showed growth of 2.2% over the same period - the trend is clearly not in Yandex's favor.Based on data received from StatCounter, the global statistical resource, Google still holds the leadership of the Russian search market, although its share declined in 2015.However, the most important fact is that Google still holds the lead in the Russian mobile search market.Revenue and profitabilityYandex's revenue for 2015 increased 17.8% y/y and amounted to 59.8 billion roubles. Specifically, in Q4 2015 revenue growth equaled 23.4% y/y. These figures exceeded the expectations of many analysts and, in general, are not bad for the Russian market. But the picture changes drastically when looking at the revenue figures dollar-wise. In this case, revenue for 2015 dropped by as much as 25% y/y, and in Q4 the decline was 4.8% y/y.The rouble devaluation is a negative factor for Yandex's profitability. While the rouble continues to depreciate, Yandex is forced to raise the salaries of IT specialists to meet international standards. The costs of leasing office space is also tied to the dollar.As a result, the rise in product development costs in Q4 2015 amounted to 35% y/y, while SG&A skyrocketed 79%. At the same time, the company's net income fell significantly below the level of Q4 2014.Source: YandexDynamics of growth in paid clicksAfter analyzing Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) Yahoo (YHOO) Google and even Alibaba's (NYSE:BABA) financial statements we see clear evidence that internet traffic is actively shifting to mobile. Naturally, it has an impact on the internet advertising market. Mobile ads are becoming smaller and cheaper, but getting more clicks. Google, for instance, is adapting perfectly to the new rules, whereas Yandex's results are concerning. Growth in paid clicks for Yandex was only 10% y/y in Q4, showing the lowest growth rate since the beginning of 2013.Please notice the sharp contrast in these figures between Yandex and Google since Q1 of last year:Source: Yandex and GoogleYandex to issue additional sharesOn February 19, Yandex announced its intention to acquire the central Moscow office complex housing its Russian headquarters at the expense of its shares. In the long run it will allow Yandex to reduce its administrative expenses by cutting rental costs. However, in the short term it will lead to additional shares issue (12.9 million or $166 million) and, as a consequence, share dilution. There is also a risk that after the expiration of the lock-up period (90 days) the active sale of shares will follow. In addition, Yandex assumes the monetary debt of $490 million, which further increases the dependence of its future financial results from the dollar rate.ConclusionThe current multipliers P/S at 5.72 and P/E at 22.71 are not low, hence, in my view, investors are not underestimating Yandex. I also do not see any qualitative improvements in the company's performance. Given the substantial uncertainty about the future of the Russian economy as a whole and the rouble in particular, I do not believe Yandex is a good investment option."
3904536,91145,2016-02-17T18:39:53-05:00,"Despite macro headwinds, Yandex delivers a solid 18% revenue growth and beats estimates.The Russian search engine company impresses with other revenues, mainly driven by Yandex.Taxi.Mobile search still a concern, not only on Android but iOS as well.Despite somewhat lofty ratios, Yandex should be preferred over the broader Russian market and other small and midcap internet companies.","Well, that's a relief… Going into the earnings release of Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), we were hoping to get some insight in the company's ability to cope with the macroeconomic headwinds. The results give us a clear answer: Yandex is pretty resilient. Although due to the depreciation of the Ruble, earnings per share in USD are significantly down, the broader image presents us a healthy business with exciting performance coming from its new businesses, such as Yandex.Taxi.Beating both bottom and top line estimatesAt the top line, Yandex was able to beat even the most optimistic analyst and reported full year revenues of RUB 59.8bn (USD 820.4 million) versus a median consensus of RUB 58.9bn. At the bottom line, the Russian internet search provider beat expectations with a slim margin at RUB 12.2bn (adjusted net income) vs. RUB 12.1bn expected.Although Yandex management noted in the earnings call that macroeconomic conditions certainly do have their impact on the company, investors can be relieved that thus far, this didn't cause any negative surprises. On the contrary, despite the difficult environment, Yandex is able to show a couple of encouraging developments.A bright picture comes from ""Other Revenues"". As noted in my previous article, these revenues are for the larger part related to the Yandex.Taxi business. The mobile ride hail division gains significant traction, being the leader in Moscow and St. Petersburg and with strong positions in other large regional cities. To remind you, the 10 largest cities in Russia all have more than 1 million citizens, with 16.8 million in the Moscow area and 5.2 million in St. Petersburg. Yandex.Taxi is available in 12 Russian cities. ""Other Revenues"" also present the results for Auto.ru and Yandex.Market.Auto.ru is a very popular automotive site (over 250,000 daily visitors) with a large database of auto ads from across Russia. Yandex.Market is a marketplace for all sorts of products, such as electronics, leisure and luxury goods. During Q4, ""Other Revenues"" reached RUB 576m, compared to RUB 371m in Q3. This is a QoQ growth of 55% and compared to last year, these revenues grew with a stellar 129%. For full 2015, ""Other Revenues"" reached RUB 1.5bn, a plus of 155%. Yandex CFO Greg Abovsky noted in the earnings call that Yandex.Taxi is the clear driver behind this strong growth. To be fair, much of Yandex increased marketing spend went towards this business unit. To put the growth of Yandex.Taxi in perspective: in 2015, ""Other Revenues"" were only 2.6% of total revenues, but attributed 10.7% to total revenue growth.Mobile developments not convincing Still, not everything at Yandex HQ runs smoothly. Yandex seems to struggle with its mobile business and the earnings release couldn't counter the skeptics. Although its market share on mobile search remained stable, the company has a hard time to expand. As we know, there may be some future improvement in market share due to the FAS-ruling that would order Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to unbundle its services on Android. But on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices Yandex is confronted with resistance as well. Market share on iOS is 45% compared to 40% on Android, but Apple removed the possibility that prompts the user to switch the default search engine to Yandex. COO Alexander Shulgin added that talks with Apple are not easy. That may indicate that improvement in market share during the next few months will be hard to achieve, if any. According to the management, the final decision in the FAS-ruling is expected to be announced late in 2016.New auction model boosts CPCs Since Q3-2015, Yandex uses a new auction model for its advertising sales, the VCG-auction. This helped the company to increase cost-per-clicks (CPCs), with 12% during Q4. COO Shulgin mentioned that the higher CPCs is the direct result of clients bidding for higher positions on the search result pages. The total number of advertisers rose with 24% during the fourth quarter. This could indicate that growth came specifically from smaller advertisers, although Yandex management stated that the breakdown in clients remained more or less the same. Yandex served 680,000 advertising clients during 2015, a plus of 22% compared to last year. In Q4, the number of advertisers grew with 24% YoY, the highest percentage since Q2-2014. Yandex management sees an increased tendency to advertise online for fast-moving consumer goods.Margins weather the headwinds As expected, margins contracted during the past quarter. However, with Q4 EBITDA margin at 36.3%, the decline was less than expected. For full 2015, EBITDA margin reached 35.1% compared to 41.5% last year. This was better than previous guided 700bps contraction. For 2016, EBITDA margin is expected to contract further to 33.1-33.5%, with management guiding for a 200bps decrease.Guidance looks conservativeDespite the 18% revenue growth last year, Yandex management takes the conservative route and indicates a guidance of 12-18% revenue growth for 2016. Obviously, it's early in the year and there's a high degree of macroeconomic uncertainty, so there's a lot to say for a broad range in the full year guidance. However, the lower end of the guidance doesn't seem to match with the overall optimistic tone communicated by Yandex. After all, 2015 had a pretty nasty macro environment as well and yet the company recorded 18% revenue growth. In addition, it suggests that expectations towards the effects of investments are somewhat moderate. As highlighted in the earnings call, Yandex will invest 'aggressively' in the taxi business. Also the upbeat tone on its new data science business, Yandex Data Factory, doesn't match with the conservative revenue guidance.Translation for investors: we should position for the higher end of the guidance. That would mean 2016 revenues of RUB 69.4-70.6bn, or a price/sales-ratio of 4.7. Yandex didn't provide an outlook on earnings. Since the bottom line came a tad higher than expected, the previous estimates for 2016 income look comfortable. As stated in the previous article, adjusted net income is expected to reach RUB 14.0bn in 2016. This corresponds with a price/earnings-ratio of 23.9 (at a USD/RUB exchange rate of 77.5). This seems a bit lofty, also compared to a projected EPS-growth of 13%.Nevertheless, there is room for positive surprises, as the strong development in Yandex.Taxi, Auto.ru and Yandex.Market show. The company will invest aggressively in Yandex.Taxi and is looking for further regional expansion. Also the new expansion in data science i.e. Yandex Data Factory, should be closely watched. Goal for Yandex Data Factory is to become break-even in 2016.Right stock, but is it the right time? So where do we stand after the results being published? Yandex showed a solid performance despite the macro headwinds. Concerns, such as for mobile revenues, are still there and require management's attention. Yandex is a robust growth story, as potential revenue growth of close to 18% for this year indicates. But a lot of the share performance depends on the Ruble and therefore also macro developments affect the share price. Investor sentiment regarding pricing for small and midcap internet companies plays a significant role as well.As stated, valuations aren't cheap with P/S at 4.7 and P/E at 23.9. Nevertheless, ratios can improve quite dramatically when the Ruble appreciates (and depreciates, for that matter…), as shown in the P/E-table in my previous article. During the recent months, we witnessed that valuations had a close relation with the USD/RUB exchange rate and analyst estimates. We should remind ourselves that Yandex is a macro play as well. Overall, I would clearly prefer Yandex over the broader Russian market and the sector. The recent results back this conviction."

In its turn, it significantly depends on the oil price. Obviously, you should still take into account the perspective of the ruble's value. However, since this characteristic is almost in a linear relationship with the oil price, it can be left out.In order to support this logic, I enclose the joint price graph of Yandex's shares and Brent oil barrel, where even the minimum and the maximum peaks match:I would like to specify that I am skeptical about the current oil price. At least, I don't believe in its long-term stability. In my opinion, the market ignores accumulated record oil stocks that are still there. According to the most recent OPEC figures, the oil stocks in OECD increased by 5.5% YOY and by 0.8% QOQ in Q1 2016, reaching 4,639 million barrels. I believe OPEC will continue to increase the oil production in an effort to gain the market share, and in the meantime, the current price already implies a slowdown in the decline of production in the United States.So for the next six months, the general foundation of the Russian market seems shaky to me. And now about Yandex.Yandex's revenue in Q1 2016 exceeded the expectations of analysts, demonstrating growth of 33.5% YOY (the highest YOY growth rate over the last seven quarters). In Russia, as in the rest of the world, the advertising budgets are increasingly spent not on traditional forms of advertising, but on the Internet advertising. This is a favorable and a long-term factor for Yandex. But the growing competition in this market affects the profitability.However, to complete the analysis, I will provide the revenue schedule of Yandex in the U.S. dollars. The last quarter recorded a positive growth rate of dollar revenues YOY solely due to the fact that in Q1 2015 Yandex's dollar revenue reached a minimum over the last 10 quarters.Source of data: YandexThe dollar equivalent of revenue is important for Yandex, because the wages of its IT professionals are pegged to the dollar. Over the recent years, the dynamics of the EBITDA margin has been reflecting the above stated.YNDX EBITDA Margin (Quarterly) data by YChartsPurchasing its headquarters, the company got rid of the lease payments in dollars, but gained the interest payments in this currency. Generally, I believe that EBITDA margin in 2016 will deteriorate due to the devaluation of the ruble and the overall situation in the economy.My particular attention in Yandex's quarterly report was attracted by the discrete results of Yandex.Taxi service, to which many analysts predict the success of Uber (Private:UBER).It is difficult to overlook the revenue growth rate of 176% YOY. But the EBITDA margin of this segment became negative. And this, in my opinion, is a direct result of the competitive struggle between Yandex.Taxi and the above mentioned Uber.Source of data: YandexAccording to Yandex, Yandex.Taxi service is represented in 17 major Russian cities as well as in Minsk. On the other hand, Uber is represented in 10 Russian cities, but obviously, it will expand. You also should not forget that Uber performs its services in 400 cities in 70 countries around the world. If a Russian citizen abroad enjoyed the services of Uber, then it is logical to assume that on his return to his country, his preferences will not change. In addition, Uber can provide additional discounts to such customers.Recently, both companies announced the reduction of tariffs in Russia, and in my opinion, this is starting to resemble a full-fledged price war. It seems to me that Uber has higher chances of winning this war.In my opinion, the growth of Yandex quotations in 2016 is largely associated with the overall recovery in the Russian market due to the oil recovery. In the meantime, Yandex remains in difficult circumstances of adverse economic situation and high competition. In this situation, the best recommendation I can give on Yandex's shares is to ""keep"" them.Unless otherwise noted, all charts included are my own."
3985748,92456,2016-07-01T10:27:34-04:00,Changes in the legislation of the Russian Federation will oblige companies like Yandex to increase their data retention period.The total industry costs of increasing the number of data centers will make more than $ 30 billion.The IT industry in Russia will be less attractive for investors.,"On June 24, the State Duma of the Russian Federation approved amendments to the law on combating terrorism and extremism. The Federation Council approved the new version of the law, and now it is awaiting to be signed by the President. This bill has been already nicknamed ""the killer of telecommunications industry"" and ""disastrous"" for the Internet industry in the mass media.If you hold the shares of Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), you should take into account the likely consequences of the changes in the legal environment for this company.The amendments cover a wide range of issues: from religion to the order of the data encryption on the Internet, and extend the powers of the security services. It is noteworthy that during the bill examination stage the expert panel, as well as the Ministry of Communications, the top managers of large companies (including Yandex) and many deputies opposed to the changes, but... the bill was pushed. Given the rapidity with which the law has been adopted, one should expect that the President will sign it.The key aspects for the IT industry are the following. Telecom operators and Internet companies must store the contents of text messages, voice information, images, sounds and videos for a period up to six months. In addition, Internet companies must store the meta data, i.e. the facts of reception, transmission and delivery of messages, throughout a year. If necessary, the law enforcement agencies should be provided not only with correspondence between users, but also with encryption keys to encrypted files.In case of signing, the law will partially come into force from July 20, 2016. A two years' period is allocated for the full implementation of the law.So, why is it bad for Yandex?In order to create the technical possibility to store the required amount of information, the company, according to experts, will need about 2.2 trillion rubles ($ 34 billion). It should be noted that this is the minimum amount I came across in the expert predictions. For example, the Director of Mail.RuGroup estimates the potential costs at 5 trillion rubles ($ 78 billion). But even if you take lesser numbers and assume that the share of Yandex in these costs is only 3%, it already exceeds the dollar revenue of the company for the past 12 months. An important notice - there are no major manufacturers of data centers in Russia, so the company will have to buy those abroad and for dollars. The new data centers will require additional costs for electricity, which clearly will reduce the gross business profitability.The adoption of the law puts foreign Internet companies in a more advantageous position, because they are not physically on the territory of Russia and the law does not apply to them. In general, it is worth noting that the passage of the bill may result in withdrawal of a large number of players from the Russian market, as well as general degradation of the Internet industry.The bill has not yet been signed, but it seems unlikely the President rejects it. It may be amended, but the key parameters will remain, hence, the Russian Internet companies will not be able to escape large capital expenditures in the next two years. In general, the industry will become more vulnerable and controlled by the Government, which is also not encouraging."
3882816,91145,2016-02-10T09:38:38-05:00,"Yandex is down 16% YTD, but that's not due to company-specific developments.Analysts upped their revenue estimates, though concerns regarding margins have risen.Upcoming earnings should reveal how Yandex can grow in a sour macro environment.","Considering the recent wild swings in the share price of internet company Yandex N.V. (NASDAQ:YNDX), one would expect a lot of major developments. However, since a previous look on the Russian search engine back in October, not a lot of company-specific news was published. Recent price movements can for the larger part be attributed to sentiment towards Russian exposure and to a lack of momentum for (small- and midcap) internet-companies. The increased volatility across the investment universe doesn't help either…As I've argued earlier, Yandex shows characteristics of a leveraged Russian proxy. The chart below shows the development of the main ETF on Russia, Market Vector Russia ETF (BATS:RSX) and Yandex since October 2015. There's a strong correlation, with Yandex looking like RSX on steroids. Nevertheless, at the bottom line Yandex was able to record decent gains, whereas RSX lost terrain. The chart below (as of closing February 8) shows that Yandex benefits exponentially from improved sentiment. Investors should keep in mind that once conditions for and sentiment towards Russia improve, Yandex is very likely to outperform the broader Russian market. The problem is only that improved sentiment doesn't stick (yet) and conditions seem to remain sour for the short term.When will the pain end?As we all know, Russia faces severe headwinds from a collapse in commodity prices. To be fair, I was caught on the wrong foot when I expected a stabilizing condition for the Russian market last year. Clearly, the market was on a different page with the oil price dropping another 30%. Needless to say, this faded expectations of a recovery of, or at least, some form of stabilization for the Russian economy. The ruble depreciated substantially (20% since previous article) and thus making companies with revenues and earnings in ruble less attractive.The macro outlook didn't turn for the better. During 2015, the Russian economy shrank 3.7%. The first quarter of 2016 will be no better with a projected 1.7-2.5% YoY decline. Especially, if the government budget is hurt. Due to the collapse in oil prices, the Russian government expects to run a deficit of 3% this year. In case oil prices stay at today's levels of $30, the deficit would exceed this level, according to Finance Minister Siluanov. A plea for additional cuts of 10% was recently made, after significant cuts in 2015. This is definitely not a supporting macro environment and Yandex isn't immune to poor economic conditions.Nevertheless, Yandex has positioned itself on grounds that witness growth despite economic headwinds. Internet usage is still growing in Russia and Yandex was able to expand its overall market share during Q4. Also Yandex Browser saw its market share increasing to 8.7% in Q4 (up from 8.1% in Q1). On the other end, Yandex mobile share is under pressure due to Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) steady rise. However, there's the Russian Antimonopoly FAS issue that could curtail Google's share. To reflect: Google bundles its services on mobile devices running the Android OS. This is against competition rules, according to FAS. A final decision has yet to be made though, and is expected later this year.Yandex's main source of revenues, online advertising, is a market that continues to expand compared to the traditional ad-market. However, online advertising expenditure is expected to have shrunk with 13.5% in 2015. Its share should have increased to 32.1% from 25.5% previously. Total amount of online ad-sales is expected to stabilize at RUB 275 billion ($3.5bn) in 2016, growing to RUB 292bn ($3.7bn) in 2017. Online Ads will have a market share of 35.2% by then. But Yandex has more to offer that could do well even in a tough environment. Yandex.Taxi, similar to ride hail company Uber, was the main driver over 'Other revenues' in Q3. Also Yandex.Money, an e-wallet, is expected to grow in a society going digital. All in all, the business of Yandex is expected to generate more revenues on the back of an online world.Pressure on Margins?Compared to three months ago, analysts surprisingly upgraded their revenue estimates.As the table below shows, consensus has actually increased, with estimates for 2017-2019 approximately 5% higher. This doesn't match with the current weak macro-outlook. Nevertheless, analysts expect lower figures at the bottom line and have reduced their net income estimates with 3.5%.Consensus stands at 2016 net income of RUB 14.0 billion, or EPS of RUB 44 i.e. $0.565 (at a USD/RUB rate of 78). Main concern is that margins will weaken due to the macroeconomic headwinds. That said, the company is expected to increase its marketing efforts.Valuations didn't changeBack in October, the USD/RUB-exchange rate stood at 66. Now, three months later, USDRUB is hovering in a range of 75-80 after having tested the 85 level on January 20. Yandex shares do not follow USD/RUB 1:1, but the exchange rate is an important factor in determining its valuation. Since revenues and income are recorded in RUB and the share price in USD, investors should take a close look at the USD/RUB-rate. As the table below shows, there's actually not a lot of difference in valuation compared to the previous article with a 2016 price/earnings-ratio close to 22 (versus 23.6).What to watch for?Yandex will publish its Q4 results on February 16 before (US) market opening, followed by an earnings call.Obviously, Yandex management's 2016 guidance will be key. That will push the Q4 bottom line a bit out of the spotlights. Market players will search for the underlying developments that drive earnings when assessing to what extent the macro economic headwinds impact the business of Yandex. As mentioned above, margin expectations have been reduced lately so the market will search for positive surprises. That means, costs are in focus and in particular headcount and salaries for developers. Marketing costs are closely watched as well, combined with its effectiveness is increased spending resulting in higher market share? Analysts will take a close look at traffic acquisition costs, which have decreased as a percent of revenues slightly during 2015.On a more specific level, it will be interesting to see to what extent the recent change in the auction model impacted advertiser spending. During Q3, Yandex switched from a generalized second price, GSP-auction to a Vichery-Clark-Groves, VCG-auction. The new auction model is based on the amount of traffic in different ad positions. This model is interesting for premium advertisers, so a remark by the management on VCG should be watched closely.Furthermore, developments in 'Other Revenues', meaning Yandex.Taxi can receive special attention as well. Is Yandex expanding in key cities and how is the company performing compared to its main rivals?A look at the chartsAfter a significant recovery in Q4-2015, this year started much more negative, with only a partial recovery in late January. The downtrend is still intact with the moving averages trending downwards. Recently the 50-day EMA was tested, only with the share price bouncing back. In the recent history, we've seen this twice (see arrows). The remarkable follow-up was a decline at first, but a renewed test not much later that succeeded, at least for a short while. Speculative investors may try to enter at a break of the 50-day EMA, since previously a potential break lower occurred at a higher level. Still, a break of the 50-day and 200-day EMA ('golden cross') is required for a significant improvement of the technical picture.There's an interesting Fibonacci level as well. January's low was not a lower low, but very close to an 85.4% Fibonacci retracement. Although this is a level which receives less attention (compared to the conventional 61.8% for example), it's sometimes a good indicator for a turnaround. Probably in this environment we shouldn't look for bottom-picking but certain price levels can give us clues to determine where price direction is heading for on the short and middle term. Levels below $11.00 should be watched as an indication for further deterioration i.e. new lows.Is it time yet?The earnings release on February 16 should give us some more insight into how Yandex holds itself in the current environment. To be fair, its share price may be driven for a large part by market sentiment towards Russia exposure and internet companies. Nevertheless, we should look for clues to assess whether Yandex can justify its status as a potential frontrunner in case of a recovery in the Russian market."
3618126,91145,2015-10-29T06:16:34-04:00,"When playing the Russian market, investors may choose an ETF or a 'proxy'.Search engine company Yandex shows an encouraging development despite bleak economy.Q3 results lead to optimism, increase in guidance.USDRUB exchange rate is key in assessment of Yandex valuation.Compared to MSCI Russia and Russia ETF, Yandex seems a proxy which comes with a leverage.","There are a number of ways to 'play' a certain country and market. A mutual fund which seeks to outperform the index is one way. For most developed markets, in today's world this is an almost controversial way of investing, since academic literature often explained that fund managers are unable to beat the market. For the Russian market, there's however an excuse to choose for an actively managed fund: country risk and corporate governance issues. However, the problem is that there are not many (exchange listed) funds to choose from for US investors. A passive ETF is therefore a better alternative. In my previous article, I outlined why the Market Vector Russia ETF (BATS:RSX) is a good way to play the Russian market. This instrument even outperforms the MSCI Russia Index.As commenter Paulo noted, another option is to play the country through an individual share, such as Sberbank (OTCPK:SBRCY). This so called market proxy will reflect the market as a whole. Proxies are mostly highly liquid large cap shares which tend to reflect (foreign) investment in- and outflows. In particular for emerging markets, investors may seek in a proxy a huge exposure towards the underlying economy. In the case of Sberbank, investors tend to believe that the depository and lending business of this bank is expected to breathe in sync with the state of the Russian economy. Sberbank serves large corporates, small and medium sized businesses and is the largest saving bank for Russian households. Looks like a good proxy. But could search engine company Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) fulfill a similar role? Yandex is one of the larger, non-commodity related, Russian companies listed on a US exchange and therefore may reflect investor sentiment towards Russia. Also the cyclical nature of the advertisement business, which is an important source of revenues, points to this line of thought. Let's dig a little deeper in yet another Russian company…Reflecting the other RussiaInternet company Yandex is most known for its search engine and website Yandex.ru. It's the leading search engine in Russia with a market share of 57.1% in Q3 2015. The company is operating in Ukraine, Belarus and in Turkey as well. The company also offers specialized search, location-based and personalized services. It also offers Yandex.Taxi, an app which searches for the nearest available taxi. Moscow's taxi scene is infamous for its wide variance in taxis, varying from illegal old Ladas to luxury cars to normal taxis (but mostly the first category in my experience), driven by a cross-section of the Russian population and immigrants of former Soviet State. Yandex.Taxi service tries to make ordering taxis a 'more predictable and safe service' and directly competes with Uber (NYSE:UBER). According to Yandex COO Alexander Shulgin during the Q3 earnings call, management is content with the performance of the app and Yandex.Taxi is currently running in 12 cities. It was the main driver of 'Other revenues' in Q3.Before digging into the financials and results, two interesting events should be pointed out. Recently, the Russian Antimonopoly Service FAS ruled that Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) violated competition rules and that the company should stop abusing its dominant market position (although its search engine market share is below that of Yandex). The regulators forced Alphabet to unbundle its apps and services on mobile Android-driven devices. This is a huge victory for Yandex (though Alphabet may appeal the decision). It also highlights the somewhat protected position Yandex is enjoying in Russia. The Russian government doesn't allow a dominant foreign internet company such as Alphabet to become a market leader. The other important event is that Yandex struck a deal with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to be the default browser in Windows 10. Windows is still the most widely used operating system on desktops so the deal does matter for usage of the Yandex search engine.Solid Q3 resultsThe recently released Q3-2015 results came in higher than expected. Revenue increased 18.2% YoY to RUB 15.4 billion (vs. RUB 15.1 billion expected). EBITDA came in higher as expected as well, RUB 6.0 billion vs. RUB 5.4 billion expected, with much better EBITDA margins at 39.0% vs. 35.6% expected. Obviously in USD the results are impacted by the weak Ruble. Revenues were USD 233.1 million compared to USD 331.5 in Q3 2014. The RUB weakened from a USD/RUB rate of 39.39 to USD/RUB 66.24. 92% of revenues comes from advertising, which grew 18%. Yandex CFO Greg Abovsky noted that there's continuing weakness in auto and financial ads which both see shrinking percentages, although at a lower rate than in the first six months of 2015. Without both segments, ad revenue growth would have reached mid-20s. Largest cost item remains personnel costs, though headcount was reduced by 46. The company however continues to search for new talent to add to the mobile team and for the Yandex browser activities. At the bottom line, adjusted net income declined 10% to RUB 3.5 billion (USD 52.9 million, compared to USD 99.4 million in Q3-2014 which once more shows the impact of a significant RUB-weakening).Yandex management upped its guidance for revenue growth. It now sees a range of 14 to 16% on a YoY basis, compared to a previous outlook of 11 to 13%. According to data from Thomson Reuters, analysts estimate that in the coming years this growth is sustainable (see chart below).Although Net Income is under pressure this year, analysts expect bottom-line results to increase roughly in a range of 17 to 22% in the coming years (median estimates). Nevertheless, estimates vary widely (see chart below).Since shares are quoted in USD, the Net Income chart above should be taken with caution. A major factor is the exchange rate. For instance, should USD/RUB drop to a rate of 40 (last seen 12 months ago!) within the next 3 years, Net Income in USD won't be USD 480 million, but could come in at 790 million in 2018. Translating to earnings per share, this means a range of USD 1.44 to USD 2.36, which implies price-to-earnings ratios of 10.9 to 6.7 (with a share price of USD 15.75 at the time of writing).Ruble expectations matter mostA lot of investors probably see a valid business case in Yandex due to the growth potential of its products & services range. It's all coming down, or at least for a substantial part of one's assessment of the Ruble and hence the Russian economy. With the current exchange rate, 2016e p/e ratio stands at 23.6, but as shown in the table below this ratio varies widely with different USD/RUB-rates.As SA-contributor Value Play pointed out in his (excellent timed) article on Yandex, the share price of Yandex shows indeed a negative correlation with the USD/RUB exchange rate. That means, with a higher USD/RUB, so a weaker RUB, the share price of Yandex declines. Value Play also noted that during the RUB-recovery early 2015, Yandex seemed to have lost value by not moving in sync. With this week's earnings release, a significant part is recovered by Yandex. But let's see how the correlation is with the leading MSCI Russia benchmark and my favorite Russia-play RSX. The Ruble started to weaken substantially since the start of 2014, when it crossed the 33.5 line and didn't look back. The chart below shows the development of the earlier mentioned names, including Yandex:It seems that Yandex shows a huge underperformance and may have plenty room to recover. But don't get fooled by this graph. For a better picture, we should look at the development of Yandex since its IPO back in 2011. This leads to the impression that there isn't a significant lag (see chart below).The graph indicates that Yandex experienced times of substantial underperformance and huge outperformance. Nevertheless, a similar development, i.e. strong correlation is visible between MSCI Russia, RSX and YNDX. This supports the view that Yandex can be treated as a Russia proxy.Yet another ProxyThe internet company Yandex shows a solid development with a promising outlook. The growth rate for the coming years is encouraging against the background of an ailing Russian economy. A potential recovery of Russia's economy could possible lead to company results which come in at the upper end of analyst's estimates. In addition, an economic recovery may also lead to a stronger USD/RUB, which significantly improves valuations of Yandex.Herein also lies the biggest risk for an investment in Yandex. If the Russian economy continues to struggle, for instance caused by a further decline in commodity prices, the USD/RUB rate may spoil the picture for Yandex. The company is well positioned and shouldn't get into trouble quick, but valuations become unattractive, as shown in the p/e table. Investors should also be aware that Russia has increased country risk. Corporate governance of Yandex is relatively strong. However, a priority share is owned by Sberbank, which is 51% owned by the Central Bank of Russia. As a result, the Russian Government could have its say in Yandex policies. In the current situation, the Russian government seems to pursue a protective policy, as highlighted by the recent FAS decision. This could change in the future (but this is currently unlikely).At bottom line, shares of Yandex can be an interesting Russia proxy which comes with a significant leverage. When believing in a Russian recovery or at least a strengthening of the USD/RUB rate, Yandex could be considered for an exposure to Russia."
3886016,98036,2016-02-11T05:43:40-05:00,"There are three reasons why I believe that Yandex's stock depreciation is not over.The big exposure to the macroeconomic and political events are the main reasons why Yandex is having a hard time.As the competition looms, Yandex might not have the resources to fight back and could lose a big chunk of market that it currently owns.The risk of losing more money by investing in the company’s stock is very real.","On February 16 Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) plans to report its earningsfor the fiscal Quarter ended December 31. After the falling stock price, the management of the company must bring positive news to the shareholders so that they can remain confident in company's bright future. However, I believe that Yandex's best days are far behind it and there is no light at the end of the tunnel so far. And here are the reasons why:1. Its main markets are in a downfallSince the annexation of Crimea in February 2014, the Russian economy started to fall apart. And it had a great impact on all of the post-Soviet states that have a close ties with the country. Unfortunately, Yandex has a big exposure to those markets. Company's major sources of revenue are coming from Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan.In the last two years Russia has fallen into a recession, its biggest export commodity oil quickly depreciated in value and the economic sanctions imposed by the European Union and USA has made thing even worse.Its growth perspectives don't add anything bright into the picture:But what's even worse, the whole post-Soviet region was impacted by all of this. If we look at the 4 main currencies of the countries where Yandex has its presence, we would see that all of them greatly depreciated against the US dollar in the last year:(Source: Bloomberg)This puts a great pressure against the company, as less people are willing to spend their money on the Yandex's services. And later in this article we'll see that because of that, the company is losing its market share to the competitors and its net income is falling apart. But now let's go back to the bigger picture.After its IPO in 2011, Yandex decided that it's time to explore the new markets and possibly establish a strong presence there. In September 2011 they launched its services in Turkey. The management believed that they could grab a 10%-20% of Turkey's internet market share and start its expansion into the other international markets. However, the experiment failed and Yandex currently controls about 5% of Turkish market. But what's worse is that in December of 2015 Russian-Turkish relations quickly started to fall apart after the Russian warplane violated Turkish airspace and was shot down by the Turkish air force. Russia denied the violation and imposed its own sanctions against the Turkey and Turkish business companies that are operating in Russia. The current situation is unstable and it's definitely not what Yandex wanted when it started its expansion into the Turkish market.2. Its ecosystem is being threatened by the competitionCreated as a search engine Yandex quickly became popular in major post-Soviet states. Over the years the company quickly progressed and created a strong ecosystem of products. However, the latest economic and political situations in the region, where Yandex is conducting its business, are signaling that the company would have a hard time to expand as fast as it did before. And as the competition looms, Yandex might not have the resources to fight back and could lose a big chunk of market that it currently owns.Let's take search for example. According to Gemius, Yandex search website is the most popular among Russians. However, its main competitors from Mail.ru and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) are not that far behind:And Ukraine as its second biggest market is currently dominated by Google, with Yandex taking only the fifth place of the most viewed sites in the country:In addition to that, its advertising service Yandex Direct is not as popular as Google's AdSence. Thanks to the big international reach and a bigger click-through rate, Russian speaking users are making a choice to use Google's service on their websites to make more profit out of it.Also, in 2011 Yandex launched its taxi booking service Yandex.Taxi. It quickly became popular in large urban centers like Moscow and Saint Petersburg. But in the last year it faced a big competition from GetTaxi and Uber, which expanded into the Russian market. And now, besides fighting its competitors, Yandex along with Uber and others are facing the protests from taxi drivers that aren't happy with the technology that helps to connect passengers with ordinary drivers for a small fee, considering the fact that taxi drivers in Russia are required to buy taxi licenses and currently their business is being wiped out by these online services.Yandex's other services like Disk or Mail are also not that popular among consumers as Google and Mail.ru have a strong ties to these fields.3. The forecast might be a problemIn its latest investor presentation, Yandex showed that its adjusted net income for the first nine months of 2015 is smaller by 13% in comparison with the same period last year:(Source: Presentation)This fact alone is signaling that the next earnings results that will have the information for the whole 2015 might not beat the 2014 results. Another interesting fact is that Yandex in its presentation showed its net income for 2014 in dollars and rubles at an exchange rate of RUR56.2584 to $1.00 as of Dec. 31 2014:(Source: Presentation)And if you remember the currency graph of USD/RUB which I presented at the beginning of this article, you would see that throughout most of 2015 the exchange rate was well above RUR60 for a $1. This means that the depreciation of the Russian currency will continue to hit Yandex businesses and worsen its outlook.ConclusionLast year for Yandex shareholders was not very bright as the company's stock was falling most of 2015:(Source: Bloomberg)The three reasons that I described in this article are also signaling that it might continue to depreciate in value in the coming quarters. Unfortunately the company cannot control the macroeconomic and political situation in the markets in which it conducts business and the risk of losing more money by investing in the company's stock is very real."
3502066,73555,2015-09-10T11:43:27-04:00,"An inclement macroeconomic environment has weighed heavily on Russian companies, presenting us with potential long-term opportunities.Yandex, one such opportunity, has been hit unduly hard, and we expect it will recover like a coiled spring in the event of a macro reversal.We also believe that Yandex is protected from competition by the Russian government. This, of course, only sweetens the deal.","A strong dollar, a weak ruble, and cheap oil all converged on any Russian stocks trading on dollar-denominated exchanges. Regardless of fundamentals and quarterly operations, share prices in these companies have been buffeted by this prevailing macroeconomic wind.Since we're big fans of bad news, we're always on the lookout for solid companies undergoing uncertainty and fear. We mentioned one such company several months ago, Mobile TeleSystems (NYSE:MBT). Today, at $11.33, we find Russia's Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) a similarly compelling macro bet.YNDX data by YChartsThe idea behind this investment is a simple risk-reward assessment. We don't think that much more downside is likely in Yandex. That said, buying stock in a Russian company (or buying stock with a macroeconomic assumption, for that matter) might not be in your comfort zone. So let's talk about a few of those risks and assumptions first (and return to them later).A tangled webIt is essential to understand that there is an understated interrelationship between the three factors that we're citing here. A strong dollar is directly correlated with cheap oil, which is directly correlated with a weak ruble. Each of these factors feeds off of the other and into their respective markets and associated economies.So perhaps it is best to admit that, rather than three factors, we're looking at one large, many-tentacled macroeconomic trend, and that buying Yandex is betting against the continuation of this trend. If you don't like betting against macro trends, read no further.Something's gotta giveWhile few conventional analysts would begin by saying that ""the ruble is too weak,"" many have said (for a long time) that ""oil is too cheap"" or ""the dollar is too strong."" From a historical perspective, we tend to agree, and we are operating under the assumption that there will be a reversion to the mean in the medium- to long-term. If you don't believe in mean-reversion and the status quo, read no further.What to look forFor those of you who remain reading, there are a few things that we think are worth considering about Yandex:First of all, we think it's obvious that the price of the stock is an artifact of drift in relative currency values, so(1) let's take a look at any correlations in that data to see what really drives the price up or down.Second, we want to know that there is undervaluation, growth, or otherwise good numbers underlying this stock, because we want extra value to be unlocked if the macro trend reverses -- so(2) let's gloss over some fundamentals.Lastly, we want to identify any risks associated with YNDX, so(3) let's think about what could go wrong.1. What moves you, Yandex?Despite our earlier assertion, it makes us a bit queasy to just say that ""it's all a single macroeconomic trend."" This is hardly ever true, regardless of how good it sounds. So let's break down YNDX's price action in terms of the macro environment.It would seem logical that the first place to look would be USD to RUB. After all, we are talking about valuing assets that are denominated in rubles on an exchange that trades in dollars. In dollar terms, YNDX's rubles (as well as ruble-denominated debt, receivables, and liquid assets) should change value with the exchange rate.But it only takes one look at the USD/RUB chart to see that this correlation isn't going to be perfect.[Source: Bank of England Official Statistics]The most obvious deviation is that YNDX appears to have lost additional value in relation to the ruble between late January and now. Where the ruble was 70:1 in January as well as late August (a notional 0% loss), during the same amount of time YNDX failed to recover a lost 30%, continuing a decline over the period from $14.91 to $10.56.This is interesting for two reasons: (1) In the early days of the ruble's devaluation, YNDX was more highly correlated with the currency, losing 50% of its value in the same period that the ruble lost 50%. (2) YNDX, as it decoupled from the currency, also decoupled from the SPDR S&P Russia ETF (NYSEARCA:RBL), which dutifully returned to its lower late-January prices as the ruble weakened again. Yandex kept going down.RBL data by YChartsWe think that there are two possible explanations for this. Either (1) YNDX, year-to-date, turned into a legitimate secular underperformer of the components of the S&P Russia ETF, or (2) it has been irrationally beaten down by traders who saw bad numbers.The reason that we think that the latter is a possibility is that YNDX is traded on an American exchange - NASDAQ - in great volume. The majority of the components of the S&P Russia ETF do not have this kind of exposure.It is perhaps even more telling that YNDX has trended more closely to oil prices than the ETF since January. If ""irrational fear"" is one of the reasons for YNDX's relative decline, oil's continued downward spiral would have surely been one of the sources of fear - even if the ruble wasn't falling as far as fast.YNDX data by YChartsBut it would perhaps serve us better to delve into our second stated consideration about Yandex at this point (rather than continue to speculate about NASDAQ traders' benchmarks). So, without further ado, what do YNDX's fundamentals look like? Have they actually underperformed year-to-date? And if so, how much, and why?2. Some fundamentalsYandex is an Internet search company. Its products are global, but to a limited extent. You might see Yandex search in the CIS, Ukraine, and Turkey, but Yandex's market is really Russia. And Yandex has historically had about 60% of the Russian web search market. More on that later.Since Yandex is mostly doing business in Russia, forex concerns - while present - seem like they shouldn't be paramount. For us as investors, however, it is critical to not dollar-denominate YNDX's sales and earnings. Declining dollar values on revenue won't tell us much about the company's actual performance. So let's take a look at how the most recent quarter sized up - either normalized or in rubles.Sticking out like a sore thumb and kicking off this strange narrative is this terrifying line from the Q2 Financial Results highlights:And this while revenues were up 14% in the same y/y period. How is that possible?Cost of revenue (which includes the costs of acquiring traffic) was only up 40 bps, so that doesn't seem to be the culprit. However, even here we start to see that - even though we'd like YNDX to be fully insulated from the macro environment - the decline of the ruble has had internal consequences (also from the PR):This cascades throughout the rest of the financial results. The year-on-year numbers that detail expenses are painful. Not only did the increase in YNDX's enormous rent expenses hurt every other expense line (SG&A, R&D, D&A, etc.); it also appears that YNDX increased employee compensation in early 2015 as a result of the ruble's weakness.Expenses were obscene, and the press release indicated that the ""primary"" contributing factor for each line was the depreciation of the ruble relative to the U.S. dollar (and the Euro, in some cases). To add insult to injury, a whopping 44.7% effective tax rate ate away at what remained (thanks to undeductable share-based compensation, also driven by the above-mentioned employee compensation issues).The take-away, however, is that this 82% y/y decline in net income is probably driven entirely by a problematic macro environment. Does that mean we're talking about one-time costs limited to this one quarter? Perhaps not, but we would also expect to see margins return to much higher levels in the medium- to long-term.For what it's worth, amidst this maelstrom of expenses Yandex management also increased 2015 revenue guidance to 11-13% from 9-12%. On the revenue-generating side of things, business is wonderful. If only the macro environment would revert to a few years ago...3. What can go more wrong?There are a few things worth considering, from the macro to the not-so-macro. First, what if...The ruble weakens further!We consider this unlikely given prior Russian central bank intervention at the 70:1 level. The chart produced above should amply illustrate this, and we'd be surprised to see this get worse. Unless...Oil gets cheaper!Is this possible? Maybe. Back in the low 70s, some daring analysts called for $40/bbl WTI. We were just barely ready to believe that at the time, and we weren't ready to believe any more ($38 WTI may have proven us wrong, however - depends how you think about it).A further plunge in oil, as well as other commodity prices, though, is more likely to happen if...The dollar gets stronger!Which is also possible, but also doesn't feel intuitive. As we've said already, these macroeconomic factors seem more ready to reverse than they are to continue. Of course, such prognostications have been proven wrong many times before.But before we conclude by saying ""YNDX looks like a pretty cool bet on the global macro environment,"" let's step back from the macro stuff that has been causing YNDX all this pain and address one of the risks that so many bring up about operating in the Internet search business:Google!This is usually the part where people say, ""Oh, they're competing with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL)? Nevermind."" And while there certainly ought to be some concern here, we don't think it's a reason to write YNDX off. Here's a chart of the Russian search market in percent:[Source: Yandex Q2 Supplementary Slides]So the above chart looks bad, right? Especially if you keep extending those lines.We have reason to believe, however, that we're not the only ones who've seen the convergence of these lines and are worried about it. The Russian government is notoriously suspicious of foreign companies, especially when those companies are headquartered in the United States and could very well be in cahoots with U.S. intelligence agencies.Somewhat ironically (given the market share distribution), something in Russia called the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) has been chasing Google for anticompetitive practices.Obviously (and reassuringly to YNDX investors), this is a political power-play that has been intimated as such in many other places (read this and this). The Russian government, it appears, is on Yandex's side of this fight, and we think that's very significant.In Russia, Antimonopoly Service creates monopoly.The ""So What?""A lot of people, for many months now, have been suggesting ways to bet on a re-weakening dollar, re-strengthening ruble, and - most notably - a much-awaited rise in the price of oil. Given how insidious these macro factors are (e.g., like Moscow office space paid for in dollars), no one has been left untouched by the shifts of the last year. This would suggest that there are many opportunities.We don't think that all macro-reversal opportunities are created equal, however, and YNDX seems to be a head-and-shoulders-above-the-rest sort of bet. A reversal of fortune would completely change YNDX's price trajectory, from the outside (price on the exchange) as well as the inside (expenses). Oh, and it's nice that the Russian government seems to be on their side. That's always a good thing.As such, we deem this a rare, mispriced opportunity born out of uncertainty. The upside is potentially 100%+. The downside is limited by further macro deterioration. We'll let you continue the due diligence from here and welcome discussion in the comments."
3733836,50311,2015-12-04T11:12:17-05:00,"Yandex is the leading search engine in Russia.Due to falling search traffic in Russia and competition from Google, YNDX filed a complaint to anti-monopoly agency.Results of the on-going dispute in Russia and European Union will change the industry and give a huge boost to Yandex's development.","Yandex NV (NYSE: YNDX) is one of the leading internet and technology companies in Russia. It operates Russia's most popular search engine and its most visited website yandex.com. History of Yandex goes back to as far as 1989, when the company's founders began working on algorithms that were the foundations of the future search engine. Today, company operates internationally, mainly in countries like Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus and Turkey.YNDX data by YChartsThe company's main source of revenue is online advertising both text-based advertising, which uses keywords selected by advertisers, and display advertising, which principally consists of graphical ads that appear on specific websites. Apart from its core services, Yandex offers a wide range of specialized services, including Yandex.News, Yandex.Market, Yandex.Mail and Yandex.Maps.According to LiveInternet, in 3Q 2015 Yandex generated 57.1% of all search traffic in Russia, slightly less than in the previous quarter, which stood at 57.4%. At the same time Google has been gradually increasing its share of the search market ever since September 2014, from 27% to 35% in 3Q 2015. Nevertheless, Yandex has managed to stabilize the downtrend in its market share since May 2015.Yandex is losing to Google on searches on mobile platforms, where Android dominates and google.com is the default search engine. On this basis, Yandex has filed a complaint to Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) on the grounds that Google was violating competition. The main point of concern is that Google colluded with smartphone manufacturers so that they pre-install Google applications in order to use the Android OS. As a consequence of that, Yandex applications could not be pre-installed and users just stick with popular Google applications. In September, FAS ruled that Google breached the law on protection of competition in Russia and must restore competition by adjusting contract with manufacturers by December, 18, and remove the pre-installed Google services.Last week, Yandex said the legal dispute with Google is going beyond just Russia and spreading to the European Union. Complaints from Yandex to the European Commission is similar to those filed by the Microsoft-backed FairSearch lobby group, ad blocker Disconnect and independent applications-store Aptoide. There is also a chance that the European Commission will take into consideration the FAS decision as Google uses the same anti-competitive practices in both regions.Google plans to appeal the decision by FAS, arguing that device manufacturers are free to use Android OS without applications from Google. Obviously, users have the freedom to install any applications they want.The company's CEO Arkady Volozh views the latest quarter as excellent, adding:Yandex has been profitable ever since its IPO in May, 2011. In Q3 2015 the company had a profit of 4.3 billion RUB ($68.1 million) up from 423 million RUB ($8.0 million) in the previous quarter. Yandex is very dependent on the ruble devaluation as Russia accounts for more than 90% of revenues. In the last quarter, an increase in earnings is among other things explained by foreign exchange gains of $31.0 million.Advertising accounts for 97% of revenues in Q3 2015. However, it has to be noted that ""Other"" revenue such as Yandex Taxi shows very strong growth of 156% in Q3 2015 and has potential for compensating for any slowdown in advertising.The company has a very strong balance sheet. Firstly, cash and equivalents stand at 38.2 billion RUB ($583 million) as of September, 2015, which covers 95% of all the liabilities. Also, debt to capital ratio is very low at 28.6%. So, the company is well-positioned for a possible weakness in the Russian economy.In conclusion, Yandex NV is one of the few Russian companies that you can get exposure to directly on the US exchanges. Therefore, aside from Russian market ETFs, in betting on Russian stock market recovery Yandex is the best play.Apart from potential gains from the FAS decision as well as European Commission, Yandex's usage accompanied with advertising revenues will increase by a strategic deal with Microsoft to be the default search engine for Windows 10 in Russia, Ukraine, and Turkey. These developments are of critical importance for Yandex in the medium-term future in Russia and Europe."
3031216,69825,2015-03-27T13:16:26-04:00,"Geopolitical tensions between Russia and the West have depressed Yandex's stock.
        If geopolitical tensions improve, the sanctions will be lifted, Russia's economy will improve, and Yandex's stock will rise.
        If geopolitical tensions worsen, Google could leave Russia, and Yandex's stock will likely rise.","When the Ukrainian crisis first began, I wrote that the crisis could be a black swan event that could send energy prices higher and that could negatively affect the S&P 500. About half a year after I wrote the article, it turns out that I was wrong. The S&P 500 has rallied and energy prices have fallen. While the Ukrainian crisis has had a deleterious effect, the crisis had a deleterious effect on Russia, not the S&P 500. Because of lower energy prices and the Western sanctions imposed on Russia, Russia's economy is in recession. Analysts forecast that Russia's GDP will contract 3% to 4% this year.Because of the poor economy and the geopolitical risk associated with Russian stocks, most Russian stocks listed on the NASDAQ have done poorly. Shares of leading Russian search engine Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) have not been spared. Yandex's stock has fallen 47% in a one year span and is currently trading around its 52 week low.But despite the underperformance, Yandex is still a compelling growth investment for long term investors.The bad news has arguably been priced in. Geopolitically, everything negative that can occur has pretty much occurred. Short of Russia breaking from the West completely, things can't get much worse. The same can be said for Russian equities. Everyone who wanted to sell has already sold their Russian holdings by now.On a long timeline, many good things can occur to Russia's economy. Russia's economy could successfully diversify away from commodities and produce more value added goods. Russia could make peace with Ukraine and the Western sanctions could be dropped. Crude oil prices could rise as excess capacity leaves the marketplace and geopolitical strife spreads. If any of the above occurs, the Ruble will rise, and Yandex's EPS will rise with it.Another reason to be optimistic about Yandex is that Google could leave Russia if the present geopolitical situation worsens. Russian President Vladimir Putin is famous for his distrust of internet companies; he once remarked that the internet was a CIA project. Given that Google is pretty much the front page of the internet, Putin may decide that Google is a threat and limit Google's Russian reach in the same way that China limited Google's Chinese reach in 2010. There are already signs that Putin is pushing against Google.In December, Russia enacted a law requiring Western tech companies to store data on local servers. Having data on local servers would give the Russian government more information on dissidents. Because of this, several major Western tech companies such as Adobe moved their divisions out of Russia. Google itself moved its R&D division outside Russia. If Russia enacts more onerous legislation against Google, Google could leave Russia completely. If this occurs, Yandex will likely gain the majority of Google's marketshare and its stock could rally much in the same way that Baidu rallied after Google left China.Fundamentally, Yandex is cheap. While Yandex's forward PE of 18.9 is slightly higher than the S&P 500's forward PE ratio of 17, Yandex's next 5 year EPS growth rate of 15.5% is significantly higher than the S&P 500's next 5 year growth rate of 6%. Yandex is the leader in Russia's search market and has successfully adjusted to the mobile age. Given Russia's 61% internet penetration, Yandex's EPS will grow faster than Russia's GDP will. Its shares are also poised to benefit if Google leaves Russia."
2992716,82456,2015-03-11T13:47:39-04:00,Yandex is a leader in the Russian Internet search market.YNDX's products have a good reputation among professionals and journalists.The company shows good results and has good fundamentals.,"Yandex N.V. (NASDAQ:YNDX) is a European Internet company (with headquarters in The Netherlands) providing search services that some refer to as ""the Russian Google."" And it is Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), of course, that's Yandex's biggest competitor. Additional services from the company's user-friendly search engine is parallel search, which presents, on a single page, the results from both a Web index and specialized information resources, such as news, shopping, blogs, images, and videos. The company operates in Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan.Recommendation (3-5 years investment horizon)I recommend that investors carefully accumulate Yandex shares (investment horizon: 3-5 years), especially in a range of $9.00-$12.00, based on:Note: There's a big political risk related to the shares from the region. Investors should be very careful. Constant monitoring of the political situation in Eastern Europe is essential.Justification- The company is a leader in its market.- Yandex shows pretty solid financial results.- YNDX's products have a good reputation among professionals and journalists.- The share price reached an all-time low last month and still remains close to it.- Price of shares undervalued for political reasons.Fundamental AnalysisYandex recently offered good financial results. 4Q2014 revenue jumped 21% year over year to 14.7 billion Russian rubles ($260.7 ml), with net income equal to 4.0 billion RUB ($70.5 ml), which means $0.42 per share. Strange as it may be, this good report had no impact on the price of shares so far. The company's ROI is still at a good level (15.20%). Yandex remains the leader of the Russian Internet search market with 59.7% market share (a decrease from 61.9% a year ago).Source: YandexWhat about international competition? Yandex tries to fight Google in the mobile market segment. The company asked Russia's antitrust agency to open an investigation against Google and to consider Yandex's belief ""that user-centric services such as search, maps, e-mail, etc. should be unbundled from Android OS."" Yandex says that Google applies ""anti-competitive practices"" that are preventing local smartphone vendors from preloading Yandex services onto Android devices.At the beginning of 2014, political risk appeared in the region, and it is having a huge negative impact on Yandex's valuation. Just look at the RTS vs. Yandex chart (below) presenting data in a three-year horizon.Source: stooq.comThe shares reached an all-time low last month and still remain near this value. It seems analysts have lost their way in the evaluation of the company. In the last few weeks, we have divergent recommendations. Standpoint Research said ""buy"" in late October 2014 (goal: $36.00). Barclays at the beginning of March 2015 shaved its price target to $19.39 from $20.00 and issued an ""overweight"" rating. At the moment, Yandex has five ""buys,"" two ""holds,"" but no ""sells.""Cash Flows/DCFMUnfortunately, the DCF model shows that fair value of this stock is $9.72 without book value (or $11.72 with book value), so we have maybe a 29-56% space for losses.Assumptions:Current Ratio/Quick RatioThis means Yandex has $3.10 of liquid assets available to cover each $1.00 of current liabilities. It is a very good result. Baidu's (NASDAQ:BIDU) quick ratio is 3.20 and Yahoo (YHOO) at 2.10.DividendsYandex N.V. does not pay a dividend.P/E RatioYandex's P/E is 23.54 while Google has 27.05, Baidu has 36.97 and Yahoo 5.68. The average P/E for Internet information providers is 55.05 (source: finviz.com). So it seems that the company is not overvalued.Key ManagersAlfred Fenaughty - Chairman of the Board of Yandex N.V.Alfred Fenaughty has been in Yandex since 2000. He was co-founder and CEO of InfiNet Wireless (a provider of wireless networking technology in Russia) and Telephony Integration (a supplier of IP telephony systems). Mr. Fenaughty received a bachelor's degree in Engineering from Columbia University (1946) and a master's degree in Electrical Engineering (1947).Arkady Volozh - Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director of Yandex N.V.Arkady Volozh is the principal founder of Yandex and company's CEO since 2000. He also is a co-founder of InfiNet Wireless and CompTek International (a distributor of network and telecom equipment in Russia). Mr. Volozh holds a degree in Applied Mathematics (Gubkin Institute of Oil and Gas).Opinion: Stable and experienced management bodes well for Yandex. However, we should be worried that none of the key managers have company shares in a portfolio.Major OwnersYandex's major owners are:Vontobel Asset Management sold significant holdings in recent quarters, according to Morningstar.Yandex institutional ownership is at the level of 69%. Remember that some investors like Peter Lynch prefer to buy companies with low institutional ownership.Source: gurufocus.comTechnical AnalysisWe can see the downward trend in all its glory in the Yandex chart above. CCI is still very low and far from the penetration of the barrier at -60 from below (which would mean that there are chances for a reversal of the trend). But there's still hope for the formation of a double bottom - or long-term consolidation - at a level $14.00-$15.50.Source: Google FinanceAs we can see in the chart above, Yandex shares were correlated with the company's major competitors through the beginning of 2014, and then events from the sphere of politics have decreased its capitalization (as well as other Russian companies).SummaryThe company may turn out to be an interesting investment in the coming quarters. Maybe a double bottom or long-term consolidation at $14.00-$15.50 will offer a good start for accumulation of shares. If the share price will decline below $14.00, it will be a good opportunity. It is very important to accumulate Yandex stocks carefully, spreading the sum which we intend to invest over several quarters."
3281275,90215,2015-06-24T14:25:47-04:00,"In the short to medium run Yandex will remain at the mercy of the political and macroeconomic environment.The Russian economy contracted by over 3% in the first five months of 2015 while the Ruble is still heavily depressed due to its close link with oil prices.Yandex has continued to thrive domestically despite the negative climate and has a near monopolistic position in Russia, as well as strong fundamentals.The stock is favorably positioned to benefit from any improvement in the political and macroeconomic situation in Russia in the months to come.","Macroeconomic and Political Headwinds:Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) has shed about 50% of its share price over the past 12 months despite reporting positive and substantial revenue, net income and EPS growth (in Ruble terms) in 2014. The reasons for this are almost exclusively political and macroeconomic. The conflict in Ukraine pushed the European Union to introduce a range of economic sanctions against the Russian economy in 2014, where Yandex makes most of its revenue. Recently the sanctions were extended until the end of January 2016, which is set to prolong the pain in the Russian economy. Russian GDP contracted 2.2% in the first quarter and 3.2% over the first five months of 2015 and is expected to contract further before the end of the year.(Source: TradingEconomics)The great oil price slide of 2014 added to Yandex's woes over the past year. A major drop in the price of oil corresponded with devaluation of the Russian Ruble, the currency in which Yandex reports its earnings. Due to Russian endemic economic reliance on oil, Yandex is quite strongly correlated with the oil price (via its link with the Ruble) as can be seen below:(Source: Financial Times)Unfortunately for existing investors Russia is not out of the woods yet in relation to its economic performance. At the St. Petersburg Economic Forum there was talk of government and economic reforms as well as continued ""import substitution"" coming from top politicians, which may be an indicator that the economy will remain depressed for some time to come. The good news is that the current share price has already priced the disastrous events of the last 18 months. Barring major unforeseen events the share price can only go up in the long-run.If and when the oil price along with the Ruble creeps back up, so will the dollar earnings of Yandex. Likewise, the share price is only poised to benefit from any improvements in Russia's relations with the west and its own economy.Upside potential:From a business perspective, Yandex is in a strong position. In April the company posted Q1 results. The highlights are as follows:(Source: Yandex Q1'15 Report)Analysts were quick to point out Yandex's slightly diminishing dominance in the Russian search market and interpreted it as a sign of Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) looming takeover in this area. The trend is currently as follows:(Source: Yandex Financial Reports)The reason for this outlook has been the impressive growth of mobile search where Google is the dominant player due to its Android operating system. However, Yandex has developed its own web and mobile browser which had 7.9% of the desktop browser market and 12.9% of the mobile browser market in Russia as of March 2015. While the browser is only marketed toward and intended for Russian speaking users and as such will not threaten Chrome and Firefox outside of CIS market, it is helping Yandex to fight for search market share. The company also has hit back at Google with an antitrust probe over the default use of Google Search and other Google services on Android devices. Moreover, given President Putin's open antagonism toward foreign internet companies Yandex may be poised to benefit from the current inward looking ""import substitution"" policies. Google has already relocated its R&D team away from Russia, and while it is quite unlikely that Google will exit the Russian market altogether Yandex will surely regain some breathing space.(Source: Yandex Q1 Earnings Slides)The company also has managed to grow its advertising base quite impressively amidst the macroeconomic turmoil. Although year-on-year growth fell from 2013 levels, the company has been able to steadily grow the base to 323,000 advertisers in Q1 2015. Recently, Yandex also has increased its capital expenditure on acquisitions such as KinoPoisk (the Russian IMDb), hiring new staff and building new data centers. The acquisition of KinoPoisk is yet another manifestation of the Google-esque strategy that Yandex is pursuing in Russia. Yandex already provides hugely popular services such as Yandex.Mail, Yandex.Maps, Yandex.Market and Yandex.Taxi. Yandex.Taxi along with the competitor GetTaxi have a strong foothold in the Moscow taxi market, estimated to be worth $1bn annually. While Yandex.Taxi is potentially a quite profitable enterprise, most of these services are aimed at bringing Yandex more traffic so it can benefit from O&O text-based and display advertisement, which forms the bulk of the company's revenue. This is a clear and positive sign that the management is keen to reverse its growing reliance on partner text-based revenue which naturally costs more to obtain.(Source: Yandex Q1 Earnings Slides)Fundamentals:The company's prudent management and its lean business model have allowed Yandex to exhibit some of the best net profit margins in the industry. Year-on-year revenues have grown 28.52% from RUB 39.50bn to RUB 50.77bn, while net income improved 26.32% from RUB 13.47bn to RUB 17.02bn.(Source: own graph based on Yandex financial reports)Most of the company's fundamentals compare favorably with those of industry peers. Despite varying in terms of market cap, Google, Yahoo (YHOO) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) can be considered the closest comparable internet information providers. The company is liquid with a current ratio of 3.66, and has a higher net profit margin than Google and Baidu. Yandex has a P/E of 17.28 which compares very favorably with the industry average of 52.30, which suggests that the company is certainly not overvalued following the recent massacre in the share price. It also exhibits a return on equity of 33.26% against the industry average of 11.90%. However, Yandex is more levered than most with a debt/equity ratio of 47.23% against the industry D/E ratio of 14.36%, and of course its USD denominated EPS is much lower than that of its peers.(Source: Thomas Reuters data)Consensus:Consensus forecast among 20 investment analysts covering Yandex also advises that the company will outperform the market. Currently there are 7 ""Buys"", 6 ""Outperforms"", 4 ""Holds"", 1 ""Underperforms"", and 2 ""Sells.""Caveats:There are a couple of things worth acknowledging about Yandex before deciding whether to invest or not at current prices. The first is that the success of the company is somewhat conditional on Google's future actions in Russia and how badly they want to pursue that market. The second caveat is Russia's increasingly restrictive internet regulation. The Duma (Russian Parliament) recently passed the Russian equivalent of the ""right to be forgotten"" bill despite heavy protests from Yandex and other members of an expert group assembled to review the proposal. Yandex maintains that the bill is very different to the directive of the same name in the EU, and in its current form leaves ample space for abuse. As it stands this piece of legislation has the potential to erase some of Yandex's revenues and profit margins. There are technological and staffing costs (extra manpower required to process requests to delete links) associated with compliance as well as non-compliance costs in the form of fines.Conclusion:Yandex has displayed its wide economic moat in Russia by continuing to grow and thrive amidst major macroeconomic challenges facing its main market. Investors have largely ignored Yandex's growth and earnings focusing instead on macroeconomic and political data. As a result, the stock has deflated by over 50% over the past 12 months pricing in all of the negativity. Moreover, there are no immediate signs available that the current economic turmoil for Russia will end in 2015. However, the stock could prove to be a great contrarian purchase for those investors who are prepared to wait for the Russian economic recovery. The Russian currency has quietly appreciated in 2015 following a meltdown at the end of 2014, while the oil price has climbed from its $50 lows and is currently hovering just above $60 per barrel. Continued concern over ISIS in the Middle East and uncertainty over a deal with Iran could push oil prices higher in the second half of the year, inevitably raising the Ruble and dollar earnings of Yandex. A probable Grexit and concerns over a possible Brexit will eventually force the EU to reconsider its position in relation to the sanctions regardless of the final outcome in Ukraine. Finally, Yandex stock could prove to be a prudent purchase when the Federal Reserve raises the interest rates in late 2015 and in 2016.The bottom line: YNDX is a good buy for any enterprising investor with a 3-5 year investment horizon."
3960553,92456,2016-03-23T14:18:21-04:00,From the perspective of a P/E ratio Yandex is greatly overrated.Baidu's market potential qualitatively exceeds that of Yandex.The current government protection of Yandex is not enough for its victory over Google within Russia.,"Russian search engine Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) and Chinese search giant Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) are often compared against each other and called ""Googles"" of their home countries. However, in my opinion, these companies, and, most importantly, the environments in which they operate, are qualitatively different, and not in favor of Yandex.Evaluating the current price level of shares of Yandex, Baidu and even Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) through the mutual comparison of their respective P/S ttm ratio values, we draw the expected conclusions - Yandex is trading cheaper than others which, in my opinion, corresponds to the internal potential of the company and the market in which it operates.However, if you compare the mentioned companies in terms of profitability, the situation will change drastically. The Yandex P/E ttm ratio is almost equal to that of Google and two and a half times higher than Baidu. In my opinion, there is a definite imbalance of prices: or Yandex is too expensive or Baidu is undervalued.Target markets potentialAccording to the estimates of the local Internet resource LiveInternet.ru, Yandex accounts for 57.3% of the Russian search market (including mobile). In the meantime, according to global statistics resource StatCounter, as of March 2016, the search engine Baidu accounts for 79.52% of the Chinese market. Moreover, while in the past 12 months the market share of Yandex decreased by 2.7%, the Chinese search engine increased by 7% in the local market during the same period. But even this is not the main point.According to the January survey by the consulting internet-company WeAreSocial, the internet penetration rate in China is 49% and in Russia 72%. Hence, Russia's indicator is significantly above the average. In my opinion, this indicates the approximation of a certain plateau in the quantitative internet penetration growth in Russia. The Chinese situation is diametrically opposite. Given the current structural transformation of the Chinese economy, which involves the growth of the service sector and high-tech industries, I believe the level of Internet penetration in the country will grow at a sufficient rate in the coming years. It will boost the development of Baidu.It remains to add that for the year 2016 the forecasted China's GDP growth is 6.5%, while Russia's GDP will reduce by 1.3 - 1.5% according to the Central Bank. In my opinion, the situation may be even worse for Russia.Government protectionGoogle left the mainland Chinese market in 2010 which allowed Baidu to develop freely.For the moment, the situation in Russia is as follows. On March 14, 2016, the Moscow Arbitration Court upheld the decision of the Federal Antimonopoly Service on the case of abuse by Alphabet (Google) of its dominant position in the market of the pre-installed application stores in Android operating system within the Russian Federation.Let me remind you that in accordance with FAS rules Google must:As we can see, such a requirement cannot be compared with the total ban of Google in China. Ideally, a user who buys an Android-based smartphone in Russia will determine himself which search engine or mail service to use. However, if this user already has a Gmail account and is used to GoogleMaps, will he move to Yandex services? This idea can be developed further. As of March 2016, Google Translate supports 103 languages at various levels. Yandex supports about 60 languages. The number of available applications in the Google Play Store on November 2015 reached 1.8 million. Yandex does not disclose information on the number of applications available in Yandex Market, but it is clear that it is much less than Google.In my opinion, it's late for Yandex to vindicate its competitive rights - a substantial part of the Russian market already belongs to Google.ConclusionIn March 2016 the stock price of a Yandex share fluctuates around $14-$15. Its quotations are affected by the Russian stock market situation, which in its turn is strongly influenced by oil prices fluctuations. Perhaps in the future the Russian Government will again support the competitive position of Yandex and it will have a short-term positive impact on the company. However, while Google is not completely banned in Russia, Yandex by itself is not a company that may be attractive for a long-term investment. It's better to buy Baidu shares."

Other examples are South Korea (Naver), China (Baidu), and Japan (Yahoo! Japan). The local search engine in the Russian internet space is Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX). The company's market share has consistently been around 60% with Google being the runner-up with about 30%. Google recently announced that it is closing its Russian engineering office amid new regulations that require internet companies to store its user data within Russia. Yandex product offering is very much alike Google's. Besides the search engine, the company offers an email service, cloud storage, an online translator and a mapping service among others.(Source: Yandex 3Q14 Report)On 23rd October, Yandex announced its third-quarter results which beat consensus on both revenue and earnings. Q4 revenue growth guidance of 27-30% y/y was also above market consensus of 23% y/y. All in all, those were very strong numbers. But since then a lot has happened and things have gotten worse and worse for Russia.Russia On the Brink of Recession With Oil SlidingRight now, there is little doubt that Russia is going into recession next year. The lower oil price and Western sanctions are taking their toll with the Ruble in free-fall and inflation at 9%. In November the country's services PMI fell sharply from 47.4 to 44.5, its lowest value since 2009 and the first sign of a looming recession. As a consequence, the Russian government said it expects a negative 0.8% GDP growth in 2015. The finance ministry said that this number is based on an average oil price of $80/barrel in 2015. Last month, the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) said that in a stress scenario of $60/bbl, the economy would contract between 3.5% and 4%. So, given the current oil price level, -0.8% GDP growth looks more like a big overestimation.The oil price is the driving factor of Russia's economy. Last week was another week of bad news for the oil price. Morgan Stanley cut its 2015 Brent crude forecast to $70/bbl from $98/bbl before. In a bear scenario, oil could fall as low as $43/bbl in the second quarter and average only $53/bbl over the next year. Russian internet stocks fell sharply on the news with Yandex's shares decreasing more than 11% on that day. OPEC and IEA also cut their demand forecast for 2015. Brent closed the week deep in the red at $61.85/bbl.That is all no good news for the oil price and in turn this is also no good news for the Ruble. The currency has followed the oil price very closely on its downward trend over the past 12 months. The CBR has been trying to stabilize the currency by raising interest rates and selling dollars, yet nothing has stopped the free-fall. And given the high and accelerating inflation of 9% and a recession just around the corner, I do not see any near-term stabilization.Fall in the Ruble Will Lead to a Stretched PE RatioThe CBR has raised interest rates five times this year, every time without any notable response from the country's currency. Last Thursday the central bank raised rates from 9.5% to 10.5% as the CBR forecasts inflation to accelerate to 10% by year-end from 9% in November. Again this could not stop the Ruble falling further. The currency devalued by another 2.7% against the dollar that day despite the rate hike. In the chart below I depicted the last five interest rate increases of the CBR, which all failed to stop the Ruble slide.(Source: Bloomberg)The USDRUB exchange rate is crucial for Yandex's share price development as its shares are listed on the Nasdaq in the US. The company generates its earnings in Ruble but the shares are denoted in US Dollar. Thus, any fall in the Ruble will lead to a stretch in the company's PE ratio (P in USD, E in RUB). So assuming a constant PE ratio and all else equal, Yandex shares will fall for any fall in the Ruble. Most importantly, this will happen without any change to earnings forecasts.Earnings Downgrades to ComeAccording to the latest data from Reuters, consensus expects Yandex to earn RUB 52.22 ($0.90) in 2015 down from an estimate of RUB 53.35 ($0.92) a month ago. Consensus for 2014 earnings is RUB 45.37 ($0.78). As said before, Russia is heading for a recession in 2015. The government forecast of -0.8% GDP growth can in my opinion be seen as a base scenario only as it is based on an average oil price of $80/bbl next year. A further fall in the oil price towards $60/bbl would lead to a contraction of as much as 4% and as I have noted before, oil price forecasts have been slashed across the board. In a recession, advertising is usually one of the first expenses that is cut by firms. Yandex generates all of their revenue from advertising, so it is just reasonable to assume consensus downgrades for 2015 earnings.You Do The MathNow we just have to play with the numbers a bit. If we assume a constant PE ratio for Yandex and change the E part of it, we can extract the share price for different levels of the Ruble and earnings. In the graph below I plotted the PE ratio for Yandex for FY14 and FY15 over the last six months. The 2014 average PE is 26.4x and for 2015 it is 22.2x.(Source: Reuters, own calculations)So let us assume a constant FY15 PE ratio of 22.2x, which is equal to the average. As said before, the FY15 earnings consensus is RUB 52.22 ($0.90). Let us first have a look at the price impact of a further Ruble devaluation without any earnings downgrades. I used the Ruble exchange rate as of last Friday's close. We see that in the case of a further devaluation, Yandex's shares could suffer severely even if there are no downgrades to earnings forecasts.(Source: own calculations)I then did the same assuming the Ruble stays at its current rate versus the dollar and playing around with the FY15 earnings numbers. Here the impact is even greater than it was for a mere Ruble devaluation. If Yandex was to earn the same next year as is forecasted for this year, which is a bit more than RUB 45, shares would be hurt by 10%.(Source: own calculations)However, I think it is extremely likely to see both earnings downgrades and a further devaluation of the Ruble given the lingering recession. Such combined scenarios are depicted in the table below. In a scenario with a USDRUB exchange rate of 62 and FY15 earnings of 48 ($0.83), Yandex's shares would lose another 11%. Note that this would still represent a 5.8% rise in earnings next year. In my eyes this would be a more advantageous scenario. In fact I think Yandex could actually earn less next year than it is forecasted to do this year.(Source: own calculations)ConclusionAfter the heavy sell-off last week (-12%), it would be fair to assume some short-term consolidation in Yandex's share price. You can disagree with me in this point, but I think over the medium-term shares still have room to fall. The recent cuts in oil price forecasts imply that the Russian economy cut shrink by as much as 4% next year. In a recession advertising is one of the first expenses that is cut by companies and this will hit Yandex hard. This will also lead to further pressure on the currency, which so far has failed to build a floor despite several interest rate increases by the central bank. Inflation is also at 9% and accelerating and the Western sanctions are adding to that. If you do the math as I did, I think you will come to the same conclusion. However, I am open to everyone who wants to challenge my view."
2754715,69825,2014-12-16T01:08:52-05:00,"Yandex's short-term future depends on Russia's economic fortunes, which is currently uncertain.Due to a depreciating ruble and a likely Russian recession in 2015, Yandex's 2015 EPS will likely be lower than the 2014 first-half run rate.Yandex is still a promising long-term play, as the Russian economy will eventually recover and the ruble will eventually stabilize.","In 2008, many investors sold Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), China's largest search engine, because the Chinese economy was weakening. Their reasoning was that if the macro picture was bad, everyone would suffer, including Baidu.While the investors who sold Baidu saved themselves a lot of grief as shares of Baidu got cheaper and cheaper, the long-term investors who had the fortitude to hold on made a killing.Shares of Baidu have since increased at least 6X from the 2008 levels.BIDU data by YChartsIn 2014, investors have an opportunity to buy another dominant search engine, with the broader macro picture deteriorating. Rather than Baidu, it is the Russian search company Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX).The company shares have fallen significantly, down 55% year-to-date, mirroring the fall of the Russian indices.RBL data by YChartsThe Russian indices have fallen in dollar terms because the Russian ruble has depreciated around 44% year-to-date. The ruble has depreciated because of capital flight due to Western sanctions and a worsening current account due to the recent plunge in crude prices. Given the sharp rise in interest rates caused by the ruble's depreciation and the fall in crude prices, Russia's economy is also likely to head into recession next year.Given that Yandex depends on Russia for over 90% of its revenues, and that ad rates typically fall when an economy enters recession, a weakening Russian economy and a depreciating ruble means that the company's earnings per share next year will likely be lower than the EPS run rate for the first half of 2014. Its forward PE ratio of 16.7 might be too low, as a consequence. (In my opinion, Yandex currently trades around a 20x-22x forward PE, although the forward PE ratio changes almost daily due to the ruble's volatility.)In the short term, given that Yandex's fortunes depend on weakening Russian macroeconomic factors, the stock could still go lower.In the long term, however, Yandex has a bright future. With an over 60% market share, it dominates the Russian search market. Given the current Russian-West tensions, it is unlikely that Russia's number two search player, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), will make any meaningful market share gains. (Google, in fact, recently announced that it would be closing its Russian engineering office because of new restrictive Russian laws. Whether this is a prelude to a Russian exit like Google's China exit in 2010 is uncertain, however. If Google completely exits, Yandex would stand to benefit greatly and its stock would likely spike in the same way that Baidu's stock rose in 2010.) In the long term, Yandex is still a great demographic play. The ruble will eventually stabilize, and the Russian economy will recover. The company's earnings per share should also continue to grow as Russian internet penetration increases and Russian GDP per capita increases."
2849986,69775,2015-01-27T11:46:13-05:00,The size of the Russian internet advertisement market could more than double by 2019.A structural shift to online advertisement mitigates the impact of declining ad spending overall.Google may be reducing its operations in the region leaving little to no competition for Yandex.Yandex.Market provides budding opportunity in E-commerce.The market is pricing in continued resilience to macroeconomic pressures leaving little room for error.,"The political situation in Russia has caused most investors to avoid the region entirely. Capital outflows have punished Russian equities, and currency depreciation has only exacerbated the issue for US dollar denominated shares. The leading internet search company in Russia, Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), is no exception. At a share price of $17.40, its NASDAQ listed shares are down 60% from their 2014 peak. During the same time, the Ruble has depreciated over 40% against the dollar. In currency adjusted terms, YNDX fell about 25% in 2014.The Russian Search MarketIn the United States, Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) dominates the online search business with a 67% share of online searches. In Russia, the dominant player is Yandex which handles 62% of online searches. Google entered the Russian market in 2001 and struggled initially with language barriers, only carving out 5% of the market by 2006. Google opened its first office in Russia in 2006 and by 2012 its market share grew to 25%. Small local search competitors such as Mail.ru and Rambler.ru lost major ground to Google during this period. However, Yandex lost very little market share and maintained its dominant position in the market.Today, the Russian search market is essentially a duopoly. Yandex boasts that its search technology more effectively handles the Russian language and delivers a superior experience for Russian users. Nonetheless, Google commands vast financial resources and technological experience which pose a serious competitive threat to Yandex in the long term. Perhaps one reason why Google has failed to take share from Yandex is hesitation to invest heavily in the region. In 2013, Google's R&D spending in Russia totaled 1,389 million rubles, dwarfed by Yandex's R&D spending of 5,827 rubles million. Of course, Google's Russian operations benefit from the company's global infrastructure and R&D, but this large gap in spending is very likely enough to give Yandex an edge in the region.Despite listing Russia as one of its priority global markets, Google shows no sign of increasing its investment in the region. In fact, recent political tension and internet crack-downs may be driving Google out of Russia. This December Google closed its main engineering office shortly after Russia passed a law requiring internet companies to store any data on Russian citizens within the country. Government regulation affects Yandex much less than it does Google, since Yandex's operations are much more focused domestically.In May of this year, the state controlled telecom company, Rostelecom, launched its own search engine, dubbed Sputnik. Currently, the search engine is an unfinished product and is in no way a direct threat to either Yandex or Google. However, the development is worthy of note as Russia continues to take steps toward controlling internet content. The government as of yet has not launched any measures which would significantly hinder Yandex's operations, mainly focusing on stifling social media and blog related content. The disproportionate impact on Google's operations in the region helps mitigate the risk of government oversight for Yandex.The Competitive Landscape: Google vs. YandexSubstantially all of Yandex's revenue comes from online advertisements. In 2013, 90% of revenue came from text-based advertisements. These are advertisements located directly within the results of a search. Revenue is generated when users click on ad links or in some cases when users perform an action on the advertised website (such as purchasing an advertised product). Google's English search engine uses the same type of ads.As a case study, I tried three searches on both Google.ru and Yandex.ru in an attempt to judge the relative effectiveness of each engine in terms of organic search results and monetized ad results. The first search was for local restaurants (Italian Restaurants in St. Petersburg). The annotated results are below.At the top of the page, Yandex returned 3 sponsored ad links for particular Italian restaurants in St. Petersburg. Google did not display any ads at the top of the page. The organic search results of both engines are both relevant, mostly returning results of sites which have lists and reviews of restaurants in the city. The Google Maps and Yandex Maps information displayed are similar. Both list restaurants with address and phone number information. Yandex displays hours and days of operation directly in the search results. Yandex also displays two buttons in the search which will allow users to further refine their search within Yandex Maps by the type of restaurant and the average check size.If you click the ""average check"" button you are taken to the Yandex Maps page for your search which orders Italian Restaurants in the area by rating and allows you to filter by the average check size. Two ads are also displayed at the top of the ratings list for sponsored Italian Restaurants. Google Maps does not offer nearly as much information or have as many filtering capabilities.At the bottom of the page, Google displays one ad for an Italian restaurant. Yandex displays four ads two of which are for Italian Restaurants in St. Petersburg. This search as a whole suggests Yandex is more effectively monetizing local Russian searches than Google. Even though Yandex displays more ads than Google, these ads are just as relevant to the search query as organic search results. Six of the seven ads Yandex returned for this search were for specific Italian Restaurants in St. Petersburg. The additional features of Yandex Maps to sort by rating and filter by check size provided far more useful information than Google was able to offer. When searching for a local restaurant in Russia, Yandex is the clear winner over Google in terms of the usefulness of the search results and effective monetization.The next search is for a local flight from Moscow to St. Petersburg.Both results are very similar with the primary organic result in both engines being a table of flights. The only major difference between the results is that Yandex returned four sponsored links at the bottom of the page, while Google did not display any ads. Three of the ads Yandex displayed advertised plane tickets, and one ad advertised railway tickets. The most useful result in both cases is the flight table which gives details of flights between Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Both tables show mostly the same flights with the same basic information. A nice feature of the Yandex table is the ability to view train and bus schedules as well. Overall, there is not much reason for a user to choose one engine over another for this type of search, but Yandex is again the clear winner in terms of monetization.The final search is for a mattress.Of the top four results on Yandex, three were ads for mattress stores and one was an organic search result for an internet store selling mattresses. Yandex also displayed a banner ad on the side of the page for a mattress store. The first result on Google is an ad for an online mattress store. The first organic result is the Russian IKEA site, followed by the Wikipedia page for ""mattress"" and a link to another mattress store. Overall, neither search result is much better than the other. However, once again Yandex has vastly more useful ads. On Yandex, all four ads are specific offers relevant to the search term, while Google returned only one relevant ad.After analyzing these search results, it makes sense why Google has had so much trouble taking share from Yandex. Google does not surpass Yandex in search quality and in some cases lacks features which Yandex supports. Google adequately interprets the Russian language, but this in itself is not enough to merit switching from Yandex to Google. Yandex's biggest advantage is its superior ad selection. For all three searches, it made sense to click Yandex's advertisement links since they were relevant to the original search term. Google seems to be severely lacking in advertising partners in Russia and this undoubtedly hurts their profitability in the region. Consider that Google's English search engine returns 17 ads (three at the top of the search and 14 on the right side of the page) when I search for a mattress. This compares to a single ad at the top of the page for the same search in Russian on Google.ru.The Mobile BattlegroundWhile Yandex has a strong advantage in desktop searches in Russia, the mobile search market remains a battleground. In Q3 2014, Yandex management estimated that their market share in iOS and android mobile platforms was 48% and 47% respectively. Yandex partnered with Apple to become a default search option starting with iOS7 in 2013 and recently partnered with Lenovo to bundle its apps with the company's mobile devices shipped to Russia.The mobile search market is vitally important for both Google and Yandex. In Q2 and Q3, mobile search queries represented 20-23% of the total. Statista estimates that in 2014 47% of all mobile phone users in Russia use a smartphone and forecasts that by 2017 this will increase to 69%. Capturing these mobile users and monetizing their searches effectively is the biggest challenge facing Google and Yandex currently.Given the importance of mobile going forward, I tested Google and Yandex's mobile search engine and apps. I started in Google Chrome with a simple search for news on Google.ru and Yandex.ru. Both engines performed well on my mobile device, quickly delivering recent headlines and links to other sources of news. Yandex displayed one ad at the bottom of the results, and Google did not display any. In terms of user experience, both engines performed about the same.Next I tested Yandex's own mobile browser. I found the browser fast, efficient, and very intuitive to use. After my setting my location, I was able to get local news without a single search.Overall, both engines and browsers function about equally on my mobile device. The Yandex browser has some aesthetic and functional differences which are geared toward Russian users. For example, whenever a link is clicked it opens in a new window by default. Yandex keeps pace with Google in most of its mobile apps. Yandex Maps performed particularly well on my mobile device and seemed to run even faster than Google Maps. I expect Google and Yandex to remain in tough competition on mobile platforms in Russia. Yandex will most likely retain the around 50% market share it currently holds in mobile search.Russian Internet Penetration and Online Advertising MarketAccording to data from Internet Live Stats internet user growth in Russia has slowed in recent years. The proportion of the population with access to internet in their home has grown from under 2% in 2000 to nearly 60% in 2014. This compares to most developed nations where well over 80% of the population has access to the internet in their home.Data from TNS Web Index shows that 71% of the population in cities with over one million has internet access. The overall country average is dragged down by more rural areas where only 51% of the population has internet access. Approximately 90% of people age 12-34 have internet access while less than half of people 35+ have internet access. Getting the older population and those living in rural areas on the internet may prove to be more difficult than getting the young population in the cities on the internet. This explains the slowing growth of internet users in the past few years and suggests that growth will remain relatively slow in the years to come.There is a strong correlation between GDP per capita and the proportion of the population with internet in any given country. The following graph was created with data from the World Bank. Each individual dot represents a country with the horizontal axis plotting GDP Per Capita in current USD and the vertical axis plotting the number of internet users per 100 population. Russia is highlighted in red.Countries with similar GDP per capita levels as Russia generally range from 52-80% internet penetration. Over the next four years, Russia is expected to grow its GDP per capita at around 2% on average. It is likely that the country could see internet penetration of 70-75% by 2019. Historically, Russia has grown its GDP per capita closer to 5-8% per year. A return to this level of growth is likely necessary to push the country into the 80% or higher penetration range any time soon.Using the assumption of 70% internet penetration by 2019 and constant population of 142 million, I project that in 2019 there will be 99.4 million internet users in Russia, up from approximately 82 million in 2014. Additionally, I assume that internet ad spending per user will grow at a CAGR of 10%.Using the above assumptions, I estimate the internet ad market in Russia will expand from 71.7 billion rubles in 2013 to 164.1 billion rubles in 2019, a CAGR of 14.8%. Some commentators and analysts are predicting much slower growth or even contraction in ad spending due to the forecasted economic downturn in Russia in 2015. Despite this, I contend internet ad spending can continue to grow due to two primary factors. First, Russia is experiencing a structural shift away from traditional advertising mediums towards internet ads, and second internet advertising has historically been more resilient to economic downturns than advertisement spending as a whole.The Russian ad market has been rapidly shifting money away from newspapers and magazines and toward the internet. In 2013 according to UBS estimates, ad spending in newspapers and magazines fell 2% and 10% year over year respectively while internet ad spending rose nearly 30%. Internet ad spending now represents over 20% of total ad spending in Russia, behind only TV ads which comprise approximately half of ad spending. In the UK and many other European countries, internet ad spending represents over 35% of total ad spending. It is likely that the structural shift to online advertising in Russia has plenty of room to continue and will bolster online ad spending even in the face of declining ad spending overall.I am modeling only 10% ad spending growth per user. This is far below the trend of well over 25% growth per year and also well below the growth rate the US experienced in a similar stage of its development. From 2002 to 2007, internet penetration grew from 59% to 75% in the US while ad spending per user grew at approximately 20% per year. Only in the dot-com bubble did ad spending per user contract significantly in the US. During the 2009 recession, internet ad spending in the US contracted only slightly, and Russian internet ad spending was even more resilient, growing 10.5%. This phenomenon could potentially be explained by a higher and more consistent ROI for internet advertisements. The cost of these ads are directly related to the amount of traffic or even product sales your site produces as a result of the ads. It is likely that many advertisers shift their budgets towards online ads during economic downturns because of this. Despite the cyclical nature of advertisement spending, the internet ad market has proven to be resilient through macroeconomic downturns.Significant Opportunity in E-commerceWhile Yandex currently generates almost all of its Revenue from advertisements, there is significant option value embedded within many of the other services Yandex operates. Some of these services generate a significant amount of traffic compared to Yandex.ru. Yandex Mail, Yandex Maps, and Yandex news, all approximately generate half as much traffic as Yandex.ru. If these services are developed and monetized, they could contribute significantly to revenue and the value of the business.Yandex Market in particular provides a significant opportunity in e-commerce. According to Ecommerce Europe, e-commerce grew 47% in Russia in 2013. 32% of the adult population shopped online in 2013 and spent on average $520 (or 20,000 RUB). In total, e-commerce spending reached $17 billion (660 billion RUB). East West Digital News estimates that the market grew at least 27% in RUB terms in 2014. In the next five years, the market may expand to as much as $40-$50 billion and in the long term (10+ years) the ultimate size of the market may reach more than $100 billion. This compares to the e-commerce market in the US which exceeded $380 billion in 2013 and in China which exceeded $180 billion in the same year.There are significant challenges remaining in the development of e-commerce in Russia. The main obstacle is an expensive and inefficient postal system. Domestic shipments often take weeks to be delivered and cross-border shipments may even take months. If a customer is not home when a package is to be delivered, the postal service is supposed to leave a note in the mailbox. These notes are often not left, and packages end up being returned to sender without the customer even being notified. To make matters worse, the postal service charges a ""storage service fee"" which is added if a parcel is not picked up within a few days. One positive development for the postal service in 2014 was the percentage of packages lost or stolen fell below 1%. Significant investments in infrastructure will likely be required for e-commerce to sustain a long term growth trajectory.Yandex has shifted their strategy with Yandex Market to capitalize on budding e-commerce in Russia. Originally, Yandex Market was a comparison shopping site with CPC (cost-per-click) monetization. In late 2013, Yandex introduced CPA monetization (cost-per-action). This allows retailers to sell their products directly through Yandex Market and pay 1% commission on all product sales. Unfortunately through Q3 of 2014, adoption of the CPA model has been sluggish. Management still intends to expand Yandex Market and focus on CPA adoption through broadening available features and running promotions.The following is an example of a Yandex Market page for Microsoft's Xbox One. Several listings are available to purchase the item; four are on a CPC model and one a CPA model. For CPC if you click to buy from one of these stores, you are taken to another website where you complete your order. The store with a CPA option can be bought directly on Yandex Market. If Yandex can entice more retailers to sell on the site with a CPA model, Yandex Market could become a one-stop-shop for online shoppers in Russia.ValuationTaking into account my market-wide forecasts and Yandex's own growth drivers, I model a 20% revenue growth rate going forward. I am not currently modeling any contribution from revenue sources other than online advertisements through 2020.I expect gross margins to decline slightly over the next few years as traffic acquisition costs increase as a percentage of revenue, in part due to the increased costs associated with mobile. Yandex has delivered solid operating margins in recent quarters, including record low SG&A expense. This operational discipline should help mitigate lower gross margins.For simplicity, I forecast EPS and cash flow in RUB terms resulting in a price target also in RUB. I will provide a USD price target based on current exchange rates, but with the recent volatility in the exchange rate, the USD based price target can change significantly with no change in the underlying business.Using my assumptions, I forecast EPS can grow from 37 RUB per share in 2015 to 95 RUB per share in 2020, an increase of 256% or a CAGR of 20.75%.According to Thomson Reuters data, Yandex's forward twelve month (FTM) PE ratio has ranged from as high as 80x to the recent lows around 20x. This data is based on non-GAAP EPS estimates in USD. Currency fluctuations and varying accounting standards make it difficult to do a 1-1 comparison with historical and present PE ratios. It is clear, however, that Yandex has historically traded significantly north of 20x FTM PE. Comparable companies also trade on average significantly higher than 20x PE. Yandex is currently trading at a PE of around 23.5x compared to an average PE of 29.7x among comparables.Using a 2016 EPS estimate of 44 RUB and a PE of 30x yields a price target of 1,320 RUB. At the current exchange rate of 64.23 USD/RUB, this correlates to a price target of 20.55 USD, or an upside of about 15%.One of the impacts of the plummeting Ruble cited by management in the Q3 conference call is potentially inflated capital expenditures.I model an increase in CapEx as a percentage of sales from 15% to 19%, which corresponds with the high end of management's guidance, and to remain at elevated levels relative to sales throughout 2015.Despite rapidly expanding CapEx over the next year, I expect free cash flow generation to be very strong and continue to grow impressively over the next five years.Using a WACC of 10.6% and a terminal growth rate of 3%, I calculate Yandex shares are worth 1,102 RUB per share, or $16.95 USD based on DCF valuation.For a downside case, I model a 10% Revenue CAGR and slightly higher traffic acquisition costs to reflect accelerated deterioration of the macroeconomic environment in Russia and greater competition from Google. In this case, I model 2016 EPS to be 40 RUB. Using a PE of 20x to reflect slower long term growth compared to the base case, this results in a target of 800 RUB or about $12.30 USD, a downside of 28%. My DCF valuation of the downside case as above results in a price target of 812 RUB, a downside of 25%.ConclusionYandex is the leading player in an underpenetrated rapidly growing market and has the potential to grow its earnings for quite some time. Despite this, Yandex remains highly valued, and the potential ROI is low relative to the high levels of risk associated with investing in Russia during this unstable period. The current valuation suggests that investors expect the internet advertising market to remain strong, and Yandex to continue growing at a rapid pace. The risk is decidedly to the downside as investors may be forced to temper their expectations in the near term.Even using optimistic growth assumptions and a PE of 30x, my model suggests Yandex has only 15% upside. This leaves very little margin of safety considering the high degree of volatility in the macroeconomic environment in Russia. In a downside scenario, Yandex is likely to depreciate 25-30% plus any potential negative impact from the ruble.Yandex shares would become compelling at a valuation closer to 20x forward EPS which corresponds to about $15 per share at current exchange rates. I recommend avoiding Yandex shares at their current valuation and waiting for a better entry point."

Shares have fallen sharply this year with the entire Russian stock market under pressure.But the biggest catalyst for Yandex pessimism has been the earnings outlook. In the spirit of a picture often telling the story best, below is the Zacks proprietary Price & Consensus chart, which plots annual estimate changes over time against the stock price.As you can, analysts have become increasingly negative in their earnings outlook over the past year.There was some bright news in November, but it was quickly discounted as inconsequential in the near-term. Here was a note from JPMorgan analysts last month...The company is profitable and hit a trailing 12-month peak in revenues of $1.393 billion in the most recent quarter. They are also expected to earn $0.95 this year, but that's down 22.5% from last year.Until the estimates for Yandex stabilize and start turning back up, it's probably best to stand aside. Just watch the Zacks Rank. It will tell you when the time is right."
3222766,65653,2015-05-29T15:33:45-04:00,"Due to the crisis in the Ukraine and subsequent devaluation of the Russian Ruble, Yandex is quoting at $18, less than half of its all time-high of $44 in 2014.The company's position in Russia remains strong with a 59% share of the Russian search market in Q1 2015.Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, the company has maintained a good top-line growth and increased its user base and advertisers. However, profitability has been affected.Long-term investors can look to accumulate the stock at every decline.There's a risk of a further fall in the stock price if the conflict in Ukraine worsens and/or if the Russian Ruble weakens.","About Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX)Yandex is the largest internet company in Russia with a market cap of around $6 billion. According to LiveInternet, as of December 2014, Yandex generated the majority of Internet searches in Russia and also was popular in the Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Turkey. The company had 67 million monthly unique users in January 2015.Limitations of AnalysisThis analysis is being carried out based on data that has been gathered from sources that are considered to be reliable, but which may have different metrics. Therefore, the information in this report should be considered informational, and investors should conduct additional research before making any investing decisions.Impact of Macroeconomic ConditionsThe crisis in Ukraine and the resultant depreciation of the Russian Ruble has had a significant adverse impact on several Russian companies, including Yandex. Furthermore, the decline in oil prices has worsened the situation. This has resulted in an increase in any costs which are USD denominated, while at the same time, companies are looking to cut their advertising spend.Recent GrowthDespite the macroeconomic conditions, Yandex has seen its business continue to grow. In its April 28 Q1 2015 review, the company reported revenue of $211 million, which represented a 13% increase from the same period in 2014. Revenue was in line with estimates, while EPS was much better than estimated by analysts. However, its adjusted net income of $39m was down 12% compared to Q1 2014.Other highlights from their Q1 2015 results:Yandex's Potential for GrowthUsersThe popularity of Yandex is predicated on the fact that the search engine is a Russian domestic company that makes use of the native language. Because of Yandex's popularity, and compatibility with the needs of Russian speaking people, its growth potential is quite large. This is due to the fact that there are more than 250 million Russian speaking people in the world.Another key factor to consider when calculating Yandex's growth potential is that Russia's Internet penetration rate is only 54%. In an advanced and comparable economy such as the United States, the Internet penetration is 84.2%, while in the UK it is as high as 89.8%. In 2013, Russia had 77.5 million Internet users, and by the end of 2014 it was estimated that the number had grown by about 7% to 82.9 million users. Estimates indicate that Russia's Internet users will grow at a rate of about 3.5% annually, until the total reaches 96.6 million users in 2018. That puts Yandex in the enviable position of being the top Internet company in a market that has a large, untapped population of potential Internet users.ARPUYandex has been trying to increase its average revenue per user by improving its website and offering new features to users. The new offerings include improvements in its search algorithms, along with apps that work with both Apple iOS and Android-driven mobile devices. The service will be offered to high revenue business clients who will help to drive up the average revenue per user numbers.The chart below shows annualized ARPU of the three top search engines in 2012, which has been calculated by dividing total revenues by the number of users. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) earns more than three times per user compared to Yandex. These numbers clearly portray the potential for expansion for Yandex as it is still in its growth stage.Source: company financials, own analysisNote: The ARPU numbers are high level and are not adjusted for extraordinary items and non-users related revenue.Peer AnalysisWhen it comes to worldwide search engine usage, Google is by far the leader. It dominates world markets with 1.1 billion monthly users and a 67.1% worldwide usage rate. That makes it the leading search engine provider in almost every major country except China and Russia. In China, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is the leading search engine provider with 440 million unique monthly users. In January 2015, Russia's Yandex was its leading search engine provider, with 67 million monthly unique visitors.Source: Yahoo Finance, Google FinanceCompetition for Market ShareGoogle does have the resources to compete with Yandex in Russia. In Q1 2015, Yandex's Russian market share was 58.6%, which was down from 61.9% in Q4 2013.Most of the decrease in market share was due to gains by Google. In November, Google controlled an estimated 31.7% of Russia's search engine market, which represents a healthy 5.3% increase from a year earlier when it controlled just 26.4%. Google also could expand its share of the Russian search market in the future as more Russians take advantage of the power of the Internet to learn English and shift away from Yandex to its English-based search engine.Yandex files a Complaint against GoogleIn what appeared to be an attempt to slow down Google's market advances, Yandex filed a complaint against the search engine giant on February 18th. In the complaint, Yandex stated that it believed Google was unfairly forcing manufacturers of Android mobile devices to install Google as their default search engine setting. Google, of course, develops and owns the Android operating system.In the complaint, Yandex stated: ""We believe that device manufacturers should have a choice as to which search provider to set as the default or which services to have pre-installed on the device ... We are talking about the need to unbundle Google's Android operating system from Google Search and its other end-user services."" The Russian Federal Anti-monopoly Service said that it had received the review, and that it could take as much as 30 days to review it.Similar complaints have been filed with the European Union, and it is already looking into the matter. It is likely that Google will defend itself by arguing that manufacturers can load other services if they, ""choose not to pre-load its software,"" or that ""customers have always been free to carry out searches via other software.""Stock Price PerformanceRussian ADRs are trading near to their lowest levels since 2008. Yandex is quoting at $18, less than half of it's all time-high of $44 in 2014.YNDX data by YChartsIn ConclusionAt the price of $18, the stock is quoting at a 2016 P/E of 19 and a PEG ratio of 0.83.Investors are reluctant to buy Russian stocks due to a combination of a Russian recession, the low cost of oil, United States and European economic sanctions and the crumbling price of the Ruble.However, the company has done well in tough economic and political conditions, and has huge growth potential as more and more Russian speakers gain access to the internet. Recovery in the Russian Ruble and oil prices could get the company back to growth in profitability.I'm looking to accumulate Yandex on every decline for a two to three year horizon."
2380645,69395,2014-08-05T06:48:32-04:00,May be a good time to look for investment opportunities in Russia given markets are depressed.There are only a few Russian companies traded in US exchanges.Yandex is a good example of Growth At a Reasonable Price.,"""When there is blood on the streets, buy property."" -- Baron Rothschild, 18th century British nobleman[This article was originally published on my blog.]Given the situation in Russia and the recent sanctions, I have been trying to look for undervalued opportunities there. I am looking at a relatively limited set of companies (only those with ADRs traded in the US), but I think that is a good way to limit risk. This gives me some comfort they are reasonably solid companies, something you cannot readily assume in general and specifically when it comes to investing in Russia.I made a small investment in Gazprom (OTCPK:OGZPY) recently, primarily because the valuation is very very compelling (about 3x EBIT and 2.5x EBITDA), but I wanted to take a further look at Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), which I see as a much more exciting company with very significant prospects.Company: YandexSummary Investment Thesis: (1) Yandex is the leading search player in Russia with significant, stable market share and one of the few credible global alternatives to Google. (2) Continued internet penetration and online marketing spend in its core markets will provide the company with tailwinds for several years, and (3) the expansion beyond Russia has a lot of potential. (4) The company is generating significant cash flow and has been returning a meaningful portion to shareholders. (5) The valuation is high, but reasonable given the company's growth prospects and market.(1) #1 Search Engine in Russia and Leading Global Search Player: Yandex has over 60% market share (of visitors) of the Russian search market. Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) push into the market back in 2006 and 2007 took dramatic share from leading portal Rambler (see Page 7 of this presentation), but Yandex share has remained incredibly steady. It is hard to compete with Google, but for the last several years, Yandex has been doing it successfully in its home market.Stable Market Share (Source: www.liveinternet.ru/)There are basically three players of meaningful global scale in Internet Search: Google, Baidu and Yandex. Bing.com and Live.com from Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) get competitive global rankings on Alexa, but I find it hard to argue they will be a powerful force in the future. I am purposely omitting the major portals (Yahoo, etc.), which of course play in search, because I do not think search is part of their USP and I do not think they are likely to be the ultimate winners. Mail.ru should be mentioned by exception since it could pose a threat to the company. With under 10% of market share in search however, I do not think it will be a major issue and they seem more focused on going down the social media route than on leaning on search.(2) Tailwinds in Core Russian Search Market: Internet penetration in Russia today is at about 60%, compared to over 80% for most developed markets. 60% penetration is equivalent to the internet penetration in the US back in 2001-2002. This alone would imply over 30% growth in the underlying market over the next 10 years, and as a larger proportion of the audience is reached, advertising spend should switch dramatically to online. Even in the US today where internet penetration from a user standpoint has largely 'run its course', online ad spend still continues to grow significantly taking share from print, radio and (surprisingly, only a very little bit from) television.Internet Usage Per Capita (Source: Wolframalpha.com)(3) Turkey and Other International Opportunities: The Russian business should be enough to sustain the valuation, but there is a significant amount of optionality in expanding the business outside of Russia. That would make the company a truly global player and a real alternative to Google. Yandex is the #2 search engine in Turkey, a large and fast-growing market which is also enjoying the tailwinds of increased internet penetration. They currently have only about 2% market share, but have a stated push to get to 20-30% market share in the next few years. Needless to say, achieving that goal would be great for the company's prospects. I like that the company is focused on actionable, achievable goals which would create lasting long-term value, but it should be noted that increasing market share from 2% to 20% is a tall order and it remains to be seen if it can be achieved. The company also has significant traffic in many of the former soviet republics, which are quite sizable economies and behind the curve on internet adoption. While somewhat speculative, I think their emerging market focus is key to what making this investment one with exciting prospects.(4) Share Buybacks: Yandex's operations are very cash generative. While there is a need for significant capital expenditures (and we should expect this to continue, certainly while the company continues to grow), the company has more recently demonstrated some commitment to shareholder value by spending significant amount of money buying back shares. The current level of buybacks may be above what is sustainable, but I like to see the company taking advantage of a choppy market to buy back some shares.Uses of Cash (Source: Company Filings and CapitalIQ)(5) Valuation: I like to make investments which are attractive from an absolute value perspective. I prefer investing in a company where the earnings yield is material enough such that if there is no multiple expansion and earnings don't grow materially, I still earn an acceptable return. This investment does not meet that criteria, but it does represent a case where I would expect the earnings to grow materially. The valuation has decreased dramatically this year, despite the company continuing to grow and deliver strong results, I suspect as a result of the current situation in Russia.Valuation Multiples (Source: CapitalIQ)I usually think of an earnings yield of 5% (a PE of 20x) as a minimum requirement to consider an investment for the long term. Yandex trades at about 25x earnings, which is 25% too expensive given that threshold, but given the coming uplift in penetration in Russia should raise the Yandex audience by over 30%, I think this is justified. Furthermore, it is relatively early days for Yandex in terms of optimizing the firms revenues and profits, something which Google has demonstrated can have a lot of power.Conclusion: From a value standpoint, it is always hard to quantify how much we should ""pay for growth"". I think Yandex represents an opportunity to buy a leading search franchise while paying a much lower premium for the upcoming growth of the business. It seems fairly likely that at the current valuation, the earnings will ""grow into"" a 2ox PE by 2015. Yandex is a good example of Growth At a Reasonable Price, if only because you have to take the risk of the political turmoil around it.Disclosure: The author has no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in YNDX over the next 72 hours.

The company also guided 27-30% revenue growth for Q4, which is slightly above consensus expectation of +23% y/y.Text-base ads continue to be the key driver behind YNDX, accounting for 93% of total revenue, while text-based ads from YNDX's own site accounted for 71% of total revenue after accelerating to +33% y/y growth vs. prior quarter (+27% y/y). Text-based ads from YNDX network grew +19% y/y, accounting for 21% of the total revenue. The growth rate decelerated slightly as the company entered the second full year agreement with Mail.ru. However, Paid Clicks revenue is picking up with +19% y/y growth on the back of higher average cost per click (+8% y/y in the quarter), suggesting that the overall online advertising environment in Russia remains healthy.Per data from LiveInternet, YNDX continues to maintain the leading position in Russia desktop and mobile search market with 60% market share driven by robust search queries growth (+13% y/y) and increasing number of advertisers on its site (+20% y/y to 300k). Recent acquisitions of AdFox, which focused on ad technology, and Auto.ru that further expanded YNDX verticals should be accretive to its future revenue and earnings growth, in my view. Finally, the launch of Yandex.Master, an online market place dedicated to domestic projects and a resurgence of Yandex. Music could potentially draw additional advertisers onto the platform, thereby strengthening the overall network effect.Valuation of 25x forward EPS is on par with that of established global peers such as Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) at 22x and Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) at 23x but YNDX should be trading at around 30x forward earnings given Russia's developing search market. YNDX remains my top pick in Russia and I reiterate my bullish view of the stock.Source: Yahoo"
2469915,59401,2014-09-04T04:05:02-04:00,Yandex's latest Q2 quarter showed that its search business remains strong and that it has been growing steadily despite the Ukraine Crisis.Yandex's stock was largely impacted by political events instead of business performance.Management expects that the company will achieve a full-year revenue growth of 25% to 30% in 2014.I believe that the stock will eventually recover when the Ukraine Crisis eases or is resolved.,"On July 29, Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX)-the largest search engine in Russia-released its latest Q2 earnings that showed the company's strong business performance despite the Ukraine Crisis.Here are some of the Q2 earnings highlights (see the Press Release for the full list):While Yandex's search engine business has been growing steadily over the past several quarters, the company's stock has dropped substantially (like many other Russian stocks) since early 2014 because of the Ukraine Crisis (see image below).Source: Yahoo FinanceFor those who like to invest in great companies for the long term, I believe that there are two important questions we should consider:I will address both questions in this article and share my perspective on Yandex's long-term prospects.Yandex's Business and Long-Term Prospects Remain StrongFirst of all, when I analyze stocks, I like to look at them as businesses instead of stock certificates because in reality, they represent partial ownership of companies.Even though Yandex's stock has dropped about 33% year to date (Jan 1 2014 to Sep 2 2014), the business has been performing quite well during the same period. For example, the company's revenue grew 32% year-over-year for Q2 2014 and 36% year-over-year for Q1 2014 (source:Financial Releases). According to LiveInternet, Yandex's Russian search market share was 61.6%, compared with Google's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) 28.3% and Mail.ru's 7.4% for Q2 2014 (see image below).Source: Yandex's Q2 2014 Earnings SlidesYandex's primary competitor is Google, which has been gaining market share from Mail.ru (Russia's largest internet portal and email service) and Rambler. Sputnik is another notable competitor. It is a state-owned search engine that was launched in May this year in order to rival Yandex and Google. Despite the increasing competition, I believe that Yandex will continue to dominate in the Russian search market because it has the best search technologies and because it is already well adopted by the majority of people in Russia. Yandex's popularity and dominance in Russia is similar to Google's domination in most of the world-with the exception of China, where Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is the most dominant.Yandex's search business has also been quite resilient during the Ukraine Crisis and the current economic sanctions against Russia that could lead the country to a recession. For example, the company's number of advertisers has been growing steadily at a decelerating rate since Q2 2012 (see image below). The company's revenues have also been growing steadily since Q2 2012 because of the increasing search queries by users and the increasing text-based advertising that match user queries, website content and user behaviors (this is similar to Google's contextual, text-based and cost-per-click advertising).Source: Yandex's Q2 2014 Earnings SlidesSource: Yandex's Q2 2014 Earnings SlidesOver the next decade, I believe that Yandex's search business will continue to grow steadily because the online advertising market in Russia is still in the early growth stage and because more users are using internet search engines such as Yandex to search for content and to advertise their businesses. Hence, I believe that the company's revenue should grow at an average annual growth rate of 15% to 30% over the next five to ten years. In comparison, management expects that the company will achieve a full-year ruble-based revenue growth of 25% to 30% in 2014 (source:Press Release).Ukraine Crisis' Impact on Yandex and Russian StocksThe Russian Trading System Index (RTSI) has been impacted by the Ukraine Crisis and has dropped -15.3% since the beginning of the year. Yandex's stock has also been impacted even though the company's business has been growing steadily during the same period. Russian stocks, including Yandex, may not perform well in the short term until the Ukraine Crisis eases. However, in the long run, I believe that Yandex's stock will eventually recover because of the company's increasing revenues, earnings and free cash flows.President Poroshenko recently dissolved the Ukraine parliament. More importantly, he called for early elections on October 26 in order to have new members who can better represent Ukrainians. At the same time, many people suspect that Russia is planning to annex eastern Ukraine that is largely pro-Russian like Crimea (western Ukraine is largely pro-European). While I do not know the outcome of the upcoming elections, I believe that the Ukraine Crisis will eventually be resolved, which should lead Yandex as well as other Russian stocks to recover from their past twelve months' historical lows.The Bottom LineI believe that Yandex's stock will eventually recover when the Ukraine Crisis eases or is resolved. The company's search business is quite resilient to the political conditions in Russia. More importantly, its search business has the largest market share in Russia and is growing with increasing revenues, user queries, advertisers and traffic. Hence, I believe that Yandex is still a great long-term investment­ even though the stock may not perform well in the short term because of the Ukraine Crisis.Sources: Yandex's Q2 2014 Press Release, Q2 Conference Call, 2013 Annual Report, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg and LiveInternet.ru.The article was originally published on Intelligent Stocks on September 2."
2191303,59401,2014-05-05T13:40:07-04:00,"Yandex's (the Russian Google) large market sell-off this year was due to negative political events and not due to company fundamentals.Yandex is still a wonderful business with great fundamentals, economic moat and long-term prospects.The stock is substantially undervalued by at least 27%, and the stock should eventually recover due to the company's increasing earnings.","Graham did not state that investment is most intelligent when it is political-like or market-like, even though politics and market behaviors can have huge influence on stocks. Instead, he firmly believed that an intelligent investor should adopt a business owner mindset instead of a speculator mindset. This business owner mindset is also shared by Warren Buffett, the most successful investor of our time.Yandex's (NASDAQ:YNDX) stock has been greatly impacted by political events in the past 3 months-including the Ukraine Crisis, the sanctions on Russia, and president Vladimir Putin's intention to have stronger internet control. In response to these political events, the stock dropped 38% year-to-date even though the company had strong revenue and net income growth for the same period, according to its Q1 2014 financial release. The stock market tends to focus on market headlines and short-term negative events, and to sell off stocks even when they have great fundamentals and long-term prospects.For long-term investors who like to invest for the long-term and focus on business fundamentals, Yandex's recent market sell-off can be a great buying opportunity. This is because its current stock price is substantially undervalued relative to its intrinsic value as well as to its peers [Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU)]. I have estimated Yandex's intrinsic value to be much higher than its current stock price (I will provide my estimates later on). And if the Ukraine Crisis and Russian sanctions do not impact Yandex's fundamentals and long-term prospects, the stock will eventually recover due to Yandex's increasing earnings.Yandex is a Wonderful Business With Great Long-Term ProspectsYandex-the Russian Google-is the most popular internet search engine in Russia with the largest market share (see image below). Its market share was 61.9% vs. Google's 27.6% for Q1 2014. Like Baidu, Yandex dominates its domestic market because of its greater brand presence, its superior search technologies in linguistic understanding of search queries as well as website content, and its greater acceptance by domestic internet users. Perhaps, the political and regulatory environment of Russia also leads to more users using Yandex instead of Google. This is similar in China in that most internet users also use Baidu instead of Google. Russia and China are two large markets that Google has failed to dominate year after year.Yandex has favorable economic prospects as it is benefiting from the internet sector growth in Russia. Russia's population is around 142 million according to the World Population Review. And its penetration rate is expected to grow from 58.2% in 2014 to 66.3% in 2017 according to eMarketer, Nov 2013 (see image below).Source: eMarketer, Nov 2013.The Internet penetration rate in Russia is lower compared with the U.S. and other developed countries. Moreover, its online advertising and eCommerce industries are still in their early growth stages. This means that Yandex's text-based advertising revenue (its main source of revenue) should continue to grow as more people have access to the internet via PC and mobile devices and as more businesses shift their ad budgets from offline to online advertising (see image below).Yandex's Intrinsic Value vs. Its Stock Price vs. Its PeersIn terms of intrinsic valuation (the company's business worth), I have estimated Yandex's intrinsic value based on three scenarios: optimistic, fair and pessimistic valuations (see image below).Based on the fair valuation scenario, I believe Yandex's fair intrinsic value is around $12 billion in market cap or $35.5 per share, which suggests that the stock is undervalued by about 27% at the time of writing. This scenario assumes that Yandex's net income will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 20% for the next decade. (Note that Yandex's net income growth in RUB was much higher for the past five years.)If Yandex's net income grows at a CAGR of 25% for the next decade, its current intrinsic value should be around $16 billion in market cap or $47.5 per share, which suggests that the stock is undervalued by about 46% at the time of writing. However, I would rather be more conservative in my estimates and value the company to be around $12 billion in market cap or $35.5 per share than choosing the most optimistic scenario.In terms of valuation comparison, Yandex is much cheaper than its peers (Baidu and Google) in terms of price-to-earnings (see image below).Ukraine Crisis and Political Risks on Russian StocksAt this moment, Yandex's biggest risks are political and macroeconomic risks instead of competition risk from Google. First, the G7 leaders' sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine Crisis may impact Russia's overall economy and will likely cause Russian stocks to be very volatile. Second, the upcoming presidential election in Ukraine on May 25 will be a significant event that may impact Russian stocks. Third, the Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that his government wants to have greater control over internet companies-such as Yandex, which I believe will be similar to China's internet censorship (source: Bloomberg).While I do not know the ultimate outcomes of these political events, I believe that Yandex's business fundamentals and economic moats will not be affected and that its earnings should continue to grow in the long-term as more people use the internet and as more businesses invest in online advertising in Russia.The Bottom LineYandex is a wonderful business that is traded at a bargain price. While the stock has dropped significantly this year, the company still has strong fundamentals, economic moat and long-term prospects. In the short-term, Yandex's stock performance will continue to be impacted by the Ukraine Crisis and Russia's political standoff with the West. But in the long-term, I believe that the stock will eventually recover and that it should increase substantially over time due to the company's increasing earnings.Sources: Yandex Q1 2014 Earnings Release & Slides, Yandex 2013 Annual Report, Bloomberg, Yahoo Finance, Morning Star, eMarketer, World Population Review and Intelligent Stocks.Disclosure: I am long YNDX, GOOGL, BIDU.

2173093,29221,2014-04-29T14:00:16-04:00,The World War III threat speech is a public relations tactic.YNDX is fundamentally and financially robust.YNDX is undervalued.,"The tension between the Ukraine and Russia seems pushing the world on the edge of ""World War III."" Russia, which is accused of being a hegemony by the Ukraine, has ""acquired"" Crimea. As a result, the Group of 7 (G7) has announced sanctions against Russia. Last Friday, the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, made negative comments related to Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), which is the biggest search engine giant in Russia. YNDX's share price was down more than 15% responding to this event.I woke up last Friday in shock after I found out that YNDX was down by 15% due to the comments Putin made. Although I didn't see any direct threat from the Russian authorities, Putin's comments did hint at tighter internet controls that will probably require more approval from the government. As a contrarian myself, I immediately sensed that this could be one of the best picks of the year. Here's why.1. The World War III threat speech is a public relations method.I am not a political expert. I cannot tell if Russia will attack the Ukraine or the other way around. The threat of a war always scares investors away. In this case, I would take the chance, because the fundamental cause of the tension, which is essentially made by business and trade, is not irrational. The Ukraine told the world that we might be facing new large-scale warfare. In my opinion, they do not want to fight at all as long as both countries keep roaring at each other. Meanwhile, China and Japan are also fighting for a tiny piece of land that lies in a crucial position, which has resources around. Both China and Japan have declared that they will defend themselves with force, if necessary. There is really nothing but just political bargaining so far. Toyota's (NYSE:TM) revenue has declined proportionally in China due to the isle issue. On the other hand, YNDX does not need to worry much about the Ukraine's search engine market share, since it is already the biggest player there.2. YNDX is fundamentally and financially robustEven after rounds of cutting target prices and rankings by Wall Street institutions, YNDX has remained as a very healthy business.For Q1 highlights 2014:YNDX has been a market leader in many areas. It has the largest traffic volume, is number one in search market share, and is the leading advertising platform. YNDX also has followed the trend by investing in social network technology firm, face.com. As online business grows rapidly all over the world, Russia, as a major exporter, has great potential ahead.Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), (NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been taking search market share in Russia. However, YNDX's market share has not changed much since 2006, which means Google has been taking share from Mail.ru (OTC:MLRUY) and Rambler.Every business is local, and YNDX has the local advantage that will enhance its position for many years ahead. YNDX's browser is a good example of how it gains users' loyalty and stickiness. YNDX's future growth is nice and sound.Financially, YNDX is robust. YNDX has $721.6M dollars cash or cash equivalents, $2.116.7B total assets. Total debt, including convertible bonds, hasn't changed much from the same period last year, around $805.2M dollars. With net income close to $500M+ a year, there is no need to worry about YNDX's pocketbook.3. YNDX is undervaluedYNDX is selling at the $24 level after a disaster day last week. Its forward-looking P/E is only 15.5. Peers like Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Qihoo (NYSE:QIHU) are selling at forward-looking P/E close to 17. One thing about Russia is that most people haven't adapted to e-commerce yet. Unlike China, most Russians still pay cash for online orders. I believe this will change gradually, as e-commerce is thriving all around the world. Even though YNDX's growth rate and revenue are lower than Chinese giant BIDU's, its ROE is the same at around the 32%-33% level. YNDX's operational control and cost efficiency are better than its peers.Last but not least, analysts were busy cutting target prices of YNDX last week. I have noticed that most target prices are still way above the current levels, leaving at least 30%-40% potential upside. In addition, investors are fleeing Russia and Russian-related assets. Fear is on the news every day.ConclusionYNDX was at $20 level a share the same period a year ago. Now it earns more money than it did then, but its share price has dropped for reasons of unseen country risk. I am certain that YNDX won't be expelled from Russia, as it plays an important role of the economy there. Just like Charlie Munger said:Now it's the time to act on YNDX.Disclosure: I am long YNDX. I am also long QIWI. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

2069273,59401,2014-03-05T13:03:50-05:00,,"Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX)-the Russian Google-is one of my favorite companies as a long-term investment. It is the market leader in Russia's search engine market, it is managed by founder and CEO Arkady Volozh-whom I think is comparable to Larry Page of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)-and it has a lot of growth opportunities in online advertising.Interestingly, Yandex has become undervalued after the stock plunged nearly 14% on Monday (March 3) after Russian troops unexpectedly invaded Ukraine for the purpose of; While I do not know Russia's true intentions, one thing I know is that many Russian stocks have become undervalued as a result of Russia's military intervention in Ukraine (see image below). This can be a great opportunity for investors who want to buy undervalued Russian stocks that are traded in the U.S. In this case, I will suggest Yandex-one of the few companies in the world that can compete with Google in the local search engine market.Source: BloombergYandex's Market DominanceYandex is the most popular internet search engine in Russia with a market share of 61.9% in Q4 2013 according to Liveinternet.ru. In comparison, Google had 26.6% and Mail.ru (Russia's leading internet company and email service) had 8.5% in the same quarter. Yandex has been the market leader in the search market in Russia for many years (see image below).Source: Yandex Quarterly Supplementary MaterialsWhat makes Yandex exceptionally competitive is that it has one of the best search technologies that may even surpass Google in Russia. The Yandex search engine often produces the best search results for user queries. Moreover, its search technology excels in understanding the Russian language-including its semantics, syntax and morphology-which is more complex than English. Most people use Yandex in Russia because of its brand popularity, its ease of use and its search accuracy.Yandex' Valuation and Growth ProspectsAt the time of writing this, Yandex is traded at 11.10 Billion USD in market cap; its P/E is at 26.43 and its PEG (5 years expected) is at 0.87, according to Yahoo Finance. If we compare its valuations (market cap, PE and PEG) with Google and Baidu's (NASDAQ:BIDU), its current stock price is relatively undervalued (see image below).One question you may ask is, ""Does Yandex have the growth prospects to support its current valuation?"" To answer this question, we have to understand that Russia's internet marketing industry is still at an early stage compared with the U.S. The Internet penetration rate in Russia is also lower than the U.S. This means Yandex is likely going to grow at a faster pace than Google as more people in Russia gain access to the internet-either through mobile devices or traditional computers-and as more companies start using online advertising in Russia. Yandex's management also gave the following guidance for 2014, which indicates the company's current revenue growth rates:The Bottom LineYandex is one of the best companies for long-term investing because it is the market leader in Russia's search market, it has a lot of growth opportunities in online advertising, and it is undervalued relative to Google and Baidu of China. The Russian market is likely going to be volatile for a while due to Russia's intervention in Ukraine. If you can handle the volatility and are willing to invest for the long-term, you may consider investing in Yandex.Source: Yandex Q4 2013 Financial Release, Liveinternet.ru, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg and BBC News.About the author: Victor Liang is a co-founder of Intelligent Stocks, a stock recommendation service that is dedicated to helping investors outperform the market.Disclosure: I am long YNDX, GOOG, BIDU.

2088503,23469,2014-03-14T09:00:00-04:00,"The market dropped after the latest Chinese data and Russian conflict, bringing into focus the Russian stock market.Yandex has dropped hard since the start of the conflict but is it a good opportunity now?In our model, we are seeing a potential 25% increase in Yandex increase in price by the end of the year.","In today's Oxen Group market recap, What's Next For The Market, we will be focusing our attention on Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX). The Russian search engine company has been hit hard by the Russia/Ukraine conflict down 20% in the past month and 26% YTD. Yet, the question is whether this conflict really has any bearing on the value of the company. We will explore that today. As always, we will also recap what happened in the market today and forecast for the coming days.Market InsightsThe market was hit hard on Thursday as fear over China and Ukraine overrode solid economic data that was announced at home as the market continued lower. China fears were continued as more February data was released that missed expectations. Retail Sales and Industrial Production both declined in their gains as well as missed expectations. Retail sales only rose 11.8% YTD versus 13.5% expectations. Industrial production came in at 8.6% versus 9.5% expectations. Some analysts have noted that a lot of this slow down came during an extended Chinese New Year that see most of the nation close down business.Still, after the 18% drop in exports earlier in the week, it was enough to spook the market. That news was only furthered by more fear over the Russia/Ukraine conflict. The country began military exercises again with 8,000 troops near the border of Ukraine, and more strong words from the West came against Russia. The controversial referendum to vote on Crimea is not supported by the USA, and this potentially explosive situation is concerning investors.That news overshadowed what was a fairly good day of data for the USA. Jobless claims were strong at 315K, beating 330K-area expectations. Retails sales came in higher than expected as well with 0.3% reading over 0.2% expectations. Export prices were showing some inflation at 0.6%, but import prices were lower at -0.2%. That news was pretty solid after a lot of weakness from January data, and retail sales show some better consumer trends.Therefore, we are actually feeling more confident now. The Russia-Ukraine conflict seems to be a buying opportunity not a selling one to us unless this blows into a full scale war, although, those times are actually good market opportunities for some industries as well.At the close, the Dow Jones (NYSEARCA:DIA) is down 231 points. The S&P 500 (NYSEARCA:SPY) is down 22 points, and the Nasdaq (NASDAQ:QQQ) is down 63 points.In Focus - YandexAfter what was a great 2013 for Yandex, 2014 has seen shares give up ¼ of their value to date. The company saw a 37% increase in revenue in 2013 as well as a 36% increase in operating income. The company's net income was also up 64%. Overall, it was a great year of growth for the company, and we want to take a look at the potential value of the company. The current situation in Russia does have some impact, but it will be minimal if this situation goes away in the next 1-2 months. This recent drop may actually be a great buying opportunity.Yandex makes almost all of their money from advertising. The company makes about 98% of their money from advertising, and it makes about 86% from text-based advertising, so the key questions and understanding of the company is based on that development. Here was a breakdown of revenue from the latest quarter:RevenuesThe company has seen is most growth in what the company calls its ""ad network,"" which is the company's partnership with Mail.ru. The company began a partnership with Mail.ru in July of 2013, and the company has been increasing partnerships to start the year, which is pretty exciting news. The company also started an ad network deal with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) near the end of February that continues to increase the power Yandex's ad network. The company's ad network increased as a percent of revenue as well from 17% to 23%. The company looks to want to continue partnerships it seems, and it may be one of the best places for growth for the company. TACs were very high for partner networks in the last quarter at over 118%, outpacing growth. Yet, these costs should start to come down from here.Another great catalyst is Yandex.Market. The market is an e-commerce model that allows Russians to complete purchses on the web base. Here is some comments from a great article by Dulik Kohomange:The market is a great catalyst to growth, and Yandex continues to dominate the market with over 60% of market share. This infographic from Search Laboratory is a great graphic to learn about Yandex:The question we want to ask, though, is whether these recent developments with Ukraine and Russia mean much for the company. Business tends to not take place with political pressure, but it likely will have some hit to the company's growth. At the same time, if the deal is short-term, it will have a little impact. Let's take a look at what the company potentially is worth:Revenue -The company is likely to continue to grow revenue at a strong rate, but we would expect some hit to revenue. In our model, we are assuming a 30% growth rate this year falling to 20-25% and stay at 15-20% from there. While we like the growth, the Russian market is consolidating, competition will grow, and the comps get harder.Operating Income -The company has noted they want to drop SG&A costs in 2014, which were at 17% in 2013. In 2012, the company was at 17% of revenue as well. TAC is expected to stay at the same levels in 2014, which will see margins rise as revenue grows. We would expect operating margins to decline some due to continued investments and TAC costs potentially rising due to the Russian influence. From there, we would expect things to rebound, but a 32-33% rate seems likely moving forward.CapEx -The company projects 14-16% of revenue to be CapEx, which is a rise from 13% in 2013. The company has been at 13-14% from the last couple years, and we would expect it to stay at around this level with some decline potentially.Discount Rate -We are using a 4% cap rate, which shows strong growth but a high WACC.Price Target -With these inputs, we came up with a $36 price tag.When we use a model that shows some weakness in 2014, we still see around 25% upside in 2014, and we believe that this pullback does represent a decent buying opportunity. Yet, the risk is still high.A great way to approach, therefore, is through sold puts that allow you to get YNDX at a lower price but gain as long as it stays flat or only declines slightly less. The 23/20 bull put spread for May17 offers 18% return, which is a solid 20% lower than current prices.Friday's OutlookThe market pulled back quite a bit on Thursday, and we will see if Friday is a follow through day or a consolidation day further. The market looks like it is paying close attention to China and Russia, so how that situation develops will be the key to the market moving forward. Tomorrow, we don't get any news from China, and we will see how Russia develops towards the referendum on March 16.Economic data from Michigan Consumer Sentiment for March is key tomorrow. It is the first look at March economic data, and we are very interested to see how that will work out for the country. If that bounces up, it could signal a potential bounce for the market.Russia will definitely be the key to watch moving into tomorrow, and we are definitely intrigued by the consumer sentiment report. The solid economic data today is a signal that we may be seeing a bounce back from the winter weather issues. If Russia passes and China bottoms, this is a perfect buying opportunity, but this will not be the story yet.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.Business relationship disclosure: I have no business relationship with any company whose stock is mentioned in this article.

2001381,24107,2014-02-06T16:20:30-05:00,,"By Tim SeymourYandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), the Google of Russia, was +4.5% today and now +9% in three days after the drubbing of emerging markets and Russia saw a lot of momentum players sell stock and some directional players shorting stock.While it is not surprising to see current indiscriminant selling of EM stocks, especially those that have had big moves higher in the preceding months, it is hard to understand how Yandex was sold off 20% in 2 weeks.Know this about Yandex: this is a ""national champion"" stock in Russia which means that the government believes this company is representative of the strength of Russia and that it should compete on a global stage with other players of similar resources and prowess.What is this ""strength of Russia?"" In Silicon Valley, and around the tech globe, this is world class programming and technological innovation.Russians are at or near the helm of some of the world's most sophisticated tech companies (see Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) for example).Yandex has held off losing market share to Google in Russia for years. In fact, Yandex has the same market share as it held in 1997 (62-64%) despite expectations that Google would dominate once they truly entered the market to take on the local Russian incumbent.There are very few companies who can compete with Google globally. Yandex is one (Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) the other).Also know that in emerging markets, from an eCommerce perspective, the search model is the preferred gateway (more than social media). Search dominates in EM, and mobile is exploding.Mobile pricing for Yandex is structurally advantaged, and as the move to mobile broadens, YNDX is better positioned than Baidu or even Google to see higher profitability from their growth.Yandex delivers 40% growth at 35x EPS, which means that growth/value ratio is better than Google and Baidu, both companies that I think offer very attractive growth for a reasonable price.Lesson: When the sky is falling in emerging markets it is difficult to close your eyes and buy quality and valuations that are compelling. Yandex is a classic case of an opportunity you need to do your work on and buy when there is a significant pullback.For traders, however, most people who follow the stock were more interested in selling at $35.00 a few days ago and now are tempted at $38.75 because the broader panic has left EM... for now."
2103163,55342,2014-03-22T04:59:44-04:00,The recent pullback in YNDX stock price is an opportunity.The market seems to have over-reacted to the Crimea Crisis.Yandex is financially strong with great growth and profitability.,"What started in 1989-90 as a search system for the government of the Soviet Union, is today one of the world's most popular search engines. Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), Russia's internet search giant, currently runs the risk of getting entangled in Russia's political aspirations.Yandex, at $30.38 a share, has fallen by over 33% from its 52 week high of $45.42 on 9 Jan. 2014, prior to Russia's move to annex Crimea. While there are risks in the near term, we think that panic selling has unlocked a great opportunity for the long-term investor.Crimean Crisis: Impact on Yandex and RussiaInvestors have been worried about the negative impact of economic sanctions imposed by the EU (European Union) and the US on an already weak Russian economy. During such economic downturns, it is expected that discretionary spends like advertising, the largest source of revenue for Yandex, will be affected the most.The EU (European Union) has imposed some sanctions on Russia, with more to come soon. However, so far, the sanctions are limited to travel bans and asset freezes directed at 21 Russian and Ukrainian officials, while the US has released a similar list of 11 individuals.Since any sanctions pertaining to oil and gas trade would have a huge economic impact on all entities involved, experts believe that the real impact of impending punitive measures on the Russian economy and Yandex may be limited. RefYandex Revenue and Profitability(Source: Amigobulls - Yandex Annual Income Statement)Though revenue in FY 2013 fell short of the company's guidance, one can't ignore the fact that Yandex's performance remained excellent. Revenue grew to $1.21 billion from $947 million a year ago and profit margins were in line with its 3 year averages even after adjusting net profits for the one-time income from the sale of majority stake in Yandex.Money.Where financial track record is concerned, Yandex has displayed robust revenue growth and unwavering profitability at operating and net levels on a consistent basis.(Source: Amigobulls - Yandex Quarterly Income Statement)In FY 2013, more than 98% of the company's revenue came from advertising, with 1% coming from Yandex.Money. Going forward, revenue from Yandex.Money will form a part of other income.Q4 2013 saw paid clicks grow at 52% vs. 50% in Q3 2013. Revenue from advertising on partner sites (or ad-network) nearly doubled sequentially, as the segment grew nearly twice as fast as ad-revenue on Yandex sites in FY 2013. The same is a result of the company's partnership with domestic competitor Mail.ru which holds 8.2% market share of the Russian online search market. Though advertising on Yandex owned sites is more profitable, the development is a result of choice rather than chance and is likely to continue.Yandex Internet Search Market ShareThough Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is still the favorite search engine in most parts of the world, Yandex controls 62% market share in Russia. It has edged past Google in Belarus, accounts for over 30% of the search market in Ukraine and also operates in Turkey and Kazakhstan. Thriving on its adaptability to local language search requirements, Yandex is difficult to dislodge in these regions.Yandex is planning a foray into the Middle East, a move that would diversify its geographical risk.Key Drivers of Future GrowthYandex - Google RTB DealYandex has recently entered into a tie-up with Google which could catapult its display-advertising revenue. The deal will allow Google's advertisers to bid for ad-spaces on sites in Yandex's ad-network while advertisers on Yandex will be able to access global ad-displays via Google's DoubleClick Ad-Exchange.The cross selling of ad inventory is carried out via an RTB or real time bidding system where buyers bid to acquire ad-space. As per estimates, by 2017, these RTBs will account for 29% of digital display ad spends in the U.S. Apart from helping Yandex expand its advertiser base, this deal could partly hedge the risk arising from an economic slowdown in Russia and help them monetize their market share in regions outside Russia.Yandex.MarketAnother exciting opportunity for Yandex lies in its transformation of Yandex.Market from a price comparison site into a full-fledged e-commerce portal. An e-commerce business run by a search engine undoubtedly has huge potential in itself, but the fact that Russia is now home to Europe's largest internet audience will definitely help its cause.Recent AcquisitionsYandex recently acquired Kinopoisk, the Russian equivalent of IMDB, to bolster its online video advertising revenue.Yandex has seen an increase in search shares across mobile platforms and its mobile maps based 'TAXI' application has been hugely popular in its markets. Yandex's recent acquisition of KitLocate, the developer of an energy efficient geo-location technology for mobile devices re-iterates the company's increasing focus of mobile platforms.Yandex ValuationWhen compared with its peers on the basis of revenue growth and profitability, Yandex does consistently better than Google, though Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) remains the best of the lot.When valued based on the average P/E enjoyed by its peers (P/E of 31.4), Yandex should be priced at $37.12 a share, representing a 22% upside from its last closing price of $30.38.Yandex has all the key elements of a financially robust company, healthy ROE, ROIC, a great track record and a gamut of exciting opportunities in the coming years. In our view, Yandex is a great company that is currently bearing the burden of geo-political risks. In the long run, however, once these risks have subsided, Yandex would be a great investment.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

Yandex trades on the Nasdaq exchange when it hasn't crashed, at around $33. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has a target price of $45. It is rated 'buy by 8 analysts, ""strong buy"" by 2, and ""hold"" by 2.YNDX also offers search engines in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus and with its latest deal Turkey. Ukraine and Russia currently have tense relations, Turkey and Russia are at loggerheads over Syria, and Belarus and Russia dispute pricing potash, so there are clear and present political risks. Yandex search is financed via advertising to computers, mobile phones and other digital devices. It also does money transfers in its homeland via a joint venture with Sberbank, called Yandex Money, of which it owns 75%.YNDX has 61.7% of the Russian search market according to LiveInternet. It also offers cloud storage, 20 gigabytes free and more if you need it, at the rate of $1/month for 10 gb or $5/m for 100 gb, with a discount for annual payment.Yandex reported second quarter profits of 2.9 billion rubles, up 47% from prior year. This equals $89.1 million or 27 cents US/share beating Capital IQ estimates by 6 cents/share. It also raised its revenue guidance for the year (in rubles) to 34-38% from an earlier estimate that revenue would rise only 30%. EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a measure of cash-flow) rose 40% to Rs4.3 billion and operating profit 43% to Rs 3.2 billion. Earnings were enhanced by Rs 35 million because of the rise of the greenback in Q2. The CEO and co-founder of the firm, Ilya Segalovich, died in July.Yandex has upwardly revised earnings and sales over the past year which also beat analyst forecasts. Brokers have now started to revise earnings forecasts up - and in one case down. But the Merrill ""thundering herd"" is positive calling YNDX the best idea in internet service firms against which it is trading at a discount.In the year to March 2013 revenues grew 34% and gross margins 57%. Net margins came to nearly 34%. YNDX is not borrowing money to grow - it has no debt. It also pays no dividend. The forward price/earnings ratio (according to Thomson Reuters) is 25x or 80% of its growth rate. Its backward p/e ratio tops 39x. The market capitalization is $10.9 billion, not small-cap land, reducing the chances of a tech major acquiring YNDX.Being from Russia and invested in the boondocks of Eastern Europe means YNDX is not closely correlated with other markets but it's risky and volatile in its own right based on the politics in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Turkey, all troubled places. It also is vulnerable to generalized tech selloffs and Nasdaq risks.Our global-investing.com biotech maven, who owned the stock for a couple of years, says it's now on a roll, with great momentum, up 52% year to date. MarketEdge says to put a sell stop at $27 to protect yourself. I don't like stops, especially not for Nasdaq shares whose after-hours pricing went wild last week after the shut-down.

2032501,23625,2014-02-19T16:57:46-05:00,,"Yandex N. V. (NASDAQ:YNDX) is set to report FQ4 2013 earnings before the market opens on Thursday, February 20th. Yandex is the largest search engine in Russia, and controls about 60% market share within the country. Although Yandex competes with search giant Google (GOOG) in Russia and the Ukraine, growth expectations are still optimistic. Wall Street is forecasting that Yandex will grow FQ4 revenue by 34% compared to last year. In addition to its search engine business, Yandex also operates other internet technologies such as Yandex.Traffic to measure traffic congestion in cities and MatrixNet for machine learning. Here’s how investors expect Yandex to report this quarter.The information below is derived from data submitted to the Estimize.com platform by a set of Buy Side and Independent analyst contributors.(Click Here to see All Estimates for Yandex)The current Wall Street consensus expectation is for YNDX to report 31c EPS and $388.64M revenue while the current Estimize.com consensus from 13 Buy Side and Independent contributing analysts is 32c EPS and $391.47M revenue. This quarter the buy-side as represented by the Estimize.com community is expecting YNDX to beat Wall Street on both revenue and profit.Throughout the previous 5 quarters for which there is data, the consensus from Estimize.com has been more accurate than Wall Street in forecasting Yandex’s EPS and revenue 4 and 2 times respectively. By tapping into a wider range of contributors including hedge-fund analysts, asset managers, independent research shops, students, and non professional investors Estimize has created a data set that is up to 69.5% more accurate than Wall Street, but more importantly it does a better job of representing the market’s actual expectations. It has been confirmed by an independent academic study from Rice University that stock prices tend to react with a more strongly associated degree to the expectation benchmark from Estimize than from the Wall Street consensus.The magnitude of the difference between the Wall Street and Estimize consensus numbers often identifies opportunities to take advantage of expectations that may not have been priced into the market. In this case we are seeing an average differential compared to other quarters.The distribution of estimates published by analysts on the Estimize.com platform range from 26c to 38c EPS and $388.50M to $402.23M in revenues. This quarter we’re seeing a large distribution of estimates for YNDX.The size of the distribution of estimates relative to previous quarters often signals whether or not the market is confident that it has priced in the expected earnings already. A wider distribution of estimates signals less agreement in the market, which could mean greater volatility post earnings.This quarter the Wall Street EPS and revenue consensuses both remained flat throughout the quarter. Over the same period of time the Estimize consensus was volatile with the EPS consensus both starting and ending the period at 32c while the revenue forecast inched higher from $391.43M to $391.47M. Timeliness is correlated with accuracy, however, it is hard to make any sense of the volatility in analyst revisions other than to say there is uncertainty in the market, which agrees with the wide range of estimates we are seeing this quarter.The analyst with the highest estimate confidence rating this quarter is sriramv, who projects 30c EPS and $389.14M in revenue. In the winter 2014 season, sriramv is rated as the 102nd best analyst and is ranked 122nd overall among over 3,850 contributing analysts. Estimate confidence ratings are calculated through algorithms developed by deep quantitative research, which looks at correlations between analyst track records and tendencies as they relate to future accuracy. In this case sriramv is making a bearish call expecting Yandex to miss the Estimize consensus on both EPS and revenue.While Wall Street expectations are high for Yandex this quarter, contributing analysts on the Estimize.com platform have even loftier expectations. Thursday morning the Estimize community expects Yandex to report 35% year over year revenue growth and 23% growth in EPS.Disclosure: None"

Many articles reported the acquisition, summarized KitLocate's technology for reducing the power consumption of GPS-based mobile applications, mentioned that Yandex is maintaining the KitLocate office as an Israeli R&D center, and then moved to the next topic. Yet another acquisition.But the implications of this acquisition are in fact much greater. Yandex's adoption and promotion of KitLocate's technology is ushering in an era in which mobile location-based services are pervasive, meaning that instead of being turn-on-turn-off, they are always on. This has huge implications for mobile technology and related M&A.Anyone who has left a mobile mapping application running throughout a several-hour stroll around the city has learned first-hand how quickly location-based applications drain smartphone batteries. Apps like pedestrian navigation by Google Maps for Mobile are great for people walking around a new city, as are the ever-widening range of applications for friend-finding, location-based reminders, check-ins, and the like, but they're currently virtually impossible to run as intended for long periods of time.The biggest culprit is GPS - it simply takes a lot of power to receive GPS signals and calculate the device's location as it moves around. Many other technologies for location positioning, such as motion sensing using sensors built into phones, also take significant power.But a new class of technologies is poised to enable location-based applications to operate with much less battery usage. This will create a flood of new applications and services that use location pervasively.A recent report listed over 130 companies working on non-GPS location positioning technologies, mostly for the purpose of working indoors. Some of these companies are poised to enable pervasive location positioning outdoors as well.One technical approach is exemplified by KitLocate, the company just acquired by Yandex. KitLocate uses a variety of methods to reduce battery use, such as turning off GPS when a phone is stationary and only turning it back on when the phone's movement indicates that its location may have changed. As long as the phone's motion sensors indicate that its owner is staying inside a single building, the GPS will be left off. A phone whose motion sensors indicate that its owner is driving will have GPS left on for longer than a phone whose motion sensors indicate that its owner is walking. The company's future plans include using motion sensors and other indoor location technologies (including Wi-Fi and Bluetooth based) to track location without GPS, and use GPS every now and then to compensate for errors that accumulate. And bottom line, when a phone is moving outdoors, it will still need to activate GPS to track position accurately.Yandex is planning to continue distributing KitLocate's technology to the market, but more significantly is incorporating this technology into its mobile search products and services, primarily serving the Russian and European markets.Another approach moves GPS-free location positioning into the chips that handle a smartphone's Wi-Fi connectivity or sensor processing. Broadcom (BRCM) has released a Wi-Fi chip that incorporates location tracking, as have Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), Cambridge Silicon Radio (NYSE:CSR), STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) and others. Moving signal analysis and sensor fusion into chips will enable them to run on a lot less power.Another approach is exemplified by start-up company Glopos, whose low-energy technology uniquely uses self-learning algorithms to determine location based on the cellular signals and parameters that are already handled by mobile phones (including non-smartphones) in the process of handling calls. Somewhat similarly, W-Locate's XIMLOCK delivers location positioning with a unique applet that runs inside a phone's SIM card, but with less accuracy due to the limited computational resources on the SIM card.Another approach is called SLAM, standing for ""simultaneous localization and mapping,"" by which a smartphone is able to enter a new area and learn over time about the Wi-Fi or Bluetooth access points nearby and how they can be used for mapping and location positioning. This may enable Wi-Fi or Bluetooth based location positioning methods, which now can only be used in areas for which the system has knowledge in advance about access points, to be used anywhere. Start-ups working on SLAM technology (also called ""blind crowdsourcing"") include PoleStar, Navin and Indoo.rs. But even with SLAM technology operating universally, such systems can only determine their locations if there are Wi-Fi or Bluetooth signals nearby.Finally, many of the major mobile companies are working on a multi-tiered approach to location services, whereby a phone can monitor its location in a coarse manner, such as knowing which cellular antenna it is near, until it gets near an area of interest. At that point it switches to a more precise, but power-hungry, method, until it gets even closer to the point of interest. At that point it turns on GPS. This approach does not work for mapping, but can work for location-based reminders, navigation over long distances, and other services. This approach is used or researched by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in their GeoFencing (patent here), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (patent here), and others.All of this is only some of the ongoing R&D in indoor location positioning, much of which can be used to deliver location services outdoors as well with less power consumption than GPS.Whichever methods succeed in the market, pervasive location positioning is poised to reach the market by the beginning of 2015, enabling locations to be tracked constantly without draining smartphone batteries or other resources. Once one or more smartphone OS supports pervasive location positioning, we can expect a wave of new applications that exploit it in new and novel ways.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

2067393,62633,2014-03-04T16:55:36-05:00,,"Analysts had set extremely high expectations for Yandex's (NASDAQ:YNDX) 4Q and full year results. With average revenues growing at 38% the last four quarters, analysts had good reasons to expect another breakthrough quarter. As seen from the company's drop in share price though, Yandex, failed to meet these lofty expectations. Is this cause for alarm? I think not. If anything, this presents a buying opportunity.You Gotta Give to GetThe primary reason Yandex failed to meet expectations, specifically bottom line, was because total costs grew by 17.1% from the previous quarter. This growth in expenses mainly occurred from rise in Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC), up 25.6% QoQ. The substantial increase in TAC, in turn, led to the deteriorating effect on Yandex's profitability. According to CFO Shulgin, the high TAC was vital and occurred mainly due to investment and expansion in Turkish search market. It is very likely that current expenses will be offset by the revenue growth in this region. After all, with a growth company like Yandex, seeing costs of sales swell indicates that the company is seeking further expansion opportunities.Home Turf DominanceYandex is continuing its dominance in the Russian search market with 61.9% market share. As a result, Yandex is the #1 destination for online searching with over 55MM unique visitors per month, more than doubling second place Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). In neighboring regions Belarus and Ukraine, Yandex has grown to become either the number 1 or 2 engine. The company enjoys a 44% market share in Belarus, overtaking Google as number one. In Ukraine, Yandex has about a 30% market share, which is runner up to Google. Defending home turf from global competitors like Google and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), while expanding in nearby regions has been the strategy for Yandex. As the above numbers indicate, the company has been successful thus far, but must continue to evolve especially with the emergence of mobile platforms.Trend towards MobileRussian online advertising is expected to grow at a 25% compound annual growth rate until 2015. Much of this growth will be a result of mobile traffic as the trend continues to exceed traditional online web surfing. Just as mobile has been key for Google's recent growth, Internet access via mobile devices will be what drives advertising for Yandex in the coming year. This movement has already started to surface as 16% of Yandex searches (and 12% of revenue) were derived from mobile. Growing market share on mobile platform and, to a lesser extent, desktop platform will be the key drivers for dominating online searches.Smartphone penetration, significant indicator for mobile advertising, could be used to analyze the potential opportunities for growth. When compared to Google (in the US) and Baidu (in China), Russia's Yandex has a lot of growth potential remaining. Russia has about half of China's smartphone penetration and a third of that in the US. Obviously, there is significant room for growth in the Russian mobile industry as technology develops in the BRIC nation, which Yandex would be a direct beneficiary of.Yandex has already experienced the growth mobile devices could offer as the search share on Android grew from 42% in December 2012 to 52% in December 2013 while search share on iOS grew from 35% in December 2012 to approximately 43% in December 2013. It is promising to see that a large number of Russian mobile users are initiating Yandex to be the prime search platform. This provides a tremendous opportunity for Yandex to continue flourishing in the current market.Yandex.Market: A unified MarketplaceIn Late 2013, Yandex transformed Yandex.Market into a marketplace platform by introducing a cost direct model and unified shopping basket to its services. This transformation provides the ability for customers to complete their purchases directly on the site without leaving Yandex.Market. This is a vital makeover as it is taking advantage of the e-commerce boom that Russia is experiencing. eBay CEO John Donahoe branded Russia as first among emerging markets in e-commerce growth. With foreign competition eager to enter the Russian e-commerce market, Yandex is using its already established brand awareness to gain an edge. The company plans to further improve this service by introducing multi-shop integration, a checkout system, client guarantee and recommendation system to attract and engage customers. Currently, Yandex.Market is situated as the #1 Comparison Shopping Destination in Russia, however Yandex has more in plan than being just a comparison site. I believe that the current market position provides Yandex a seamless transition from being #1 Comparison Shopping Destination in Russia to #1 Online Retailer. With this implementation, investors can view Yandex as bringing the best features of Google and Amazon.Turkish Market PenetrationTurkey is one of the largest and fastest-growing online markets in the world with an online advertisement market around $234 Mil. This is projected to grow to $441 Mil by 2015, a compounded annual growth rate of about 24% per year. In addition to the exponential growth that Turkey presents, it is also the first country where Russian is not the major language. This is significant for Yandex because so far, the company has thrived in a Cyrillic system. This language difference has been utilized by Yandex as a barrier to entry in its home market, but now has presented a challenge when expanding internationally. Though Yandex only boasts a 4% market share in Turkey, this is four fold greater than its figure a year ago.According ComScore, there is a 400% increase in average number of visitors compared to year ago clocking in 1.4MM visitors daily. Mehmet Ali Yalçindağ, chairman of the board of Yandex Turkey, believes that the company will able to secure at least 25 and possibly 30% of the market within the next 3 to 5 years. If Yandex can successfully position itself as the number two engine in Turkey, it will show that such expansion is possible in other international locations, thus providing the company with further growth potential.Financial StabilityYandex has 1.48B in their cash balance, which the company plans to return to shareholders through a Share Repurchase Program. The Board of Directors has given the authorization to repurchase up to 15 million shares in open market transactions. As part of the previously announced share repurchase program, the company repurchased 10 million shares, returning shareholders approximately $260 million worth of value in 2013. This further confirms management's beliefs on positive future prospects of Yandex and the need to continually add to shareholders' value. The company has favored the use of share repurchase program instead of paying dividends to appease shareholders. In my opinion, this represents a more efficient means of returning to shareholders since it voids the need to pay dividend tax. In any case, a competent and shareholder friendly management team is definitely a bonus that favors Yandex as an investment.ValuationIn comparison to other leading search engine companies like Google and Baidu , Yandex trades at a very reasonable price. Not only does Yandex boast a lower P/E, but its EPS growth is much higher than Baidu and Google while revenue growth has kept up with that of competitors. Though management expects top line growth to slow from the high 30% range, guidance came in at 25-30% growth for 2014. This outlook should tell investors that Yandex will continue to be a growth story for at least the next 12 months.Caught in the Crossfire of Geopolitical TensionIt will be interesting to see how the growing tensions in Eastern Europe affect Yandex's price and operations moving forward. Russia and Ukraine are Yandex's two largest markets, so any political impairment will undoubtedly spill over to Yandex. Theoretically though, as the spotlight is focused on Eastern Europe, Yandex should see more search hits and increased online activity. So, from an operational point of view, the tension in Russia/Ukraine could promote Yandex. However, as we saw, the financial market selloff shaved over 10% of Yandex's value in one day. Real downside risk is present especially in case of further sanctions. Investors must be willing to accept the economic hazards Russian companies will face if tensions escalate.The effects these events have had on the Russian economy could be seen as a method of stabilizing tensions. The Moscow Exchange's Micex index tanked nearly 11% as investors sucked capital out of the market. The ruble sank to an all-time low vs. the dollar. Russia's central bank was forced to announce the largest hike in its main interest rate since 1998, to 7% from 5.5%. As a result, Putin eased on his stance by calling off 150,000 troops back to Russian bases and stating military force would be the last resort.Ultimately, the financial markets conveyed the consequences Russia will face. Playing hardball will lead to only more economic losses for Russia. Though Putin may be greedy, he isn't dumb. Due to this, I think a contrarian approach could payoff for Yandex investors. The Russian/Ukrainian tensions may drag on, but in my view, are not thesis changing events. After all is said and done, this could present an even more attractive Yandex buying opportunity.ConclusionOne of the primary reasons Yandex failed to meet analyst expectations was due to total costs associated with expansion efforts in the Turkish Market. Taking a longer-term view, I believe that this was the correct move by Yandex as Turkey is one of the largest and fastest-growing online markets in the world. Seeking aggressive expansion into this market will only pay future dividends for Yandex. In the meantime, Yandex continues to show its dominance in the Russian search market while also planning to broaden this supremacy to upcoming trends like the mobile shift and e-commerce boom. Not only is Yandex an attractive investment from a value perspective, but it continues to give back to its shareholders through its stable financial position. Barring any military outbursts in the Eastern European region, Yandex presents a solid investment for us across the pond.Disclosure: I am long YNDX.

(NASDAQ:YNDX) on July 9 in a piece entitled 3 Reasons To Consider Going Long Yandex, shares are up by more than 28%.YNDX data by YChartsNew Options ActivityOne of the reasons why I was bullish on YNDX was the bullish options activity. The options strategy has paid off as YNDX has moved nicely higher since the trade was put on. However, as reported by Option Monster in mid September, the trade was altered to benefit from more potential upside in YNDX. The previous bullish call spread was sold and the trader purchased the $25 calls. This move indicates that the institutional investor who was initially bullish on the stock expects gains to continue.Search Share DeclinesIt was recently reported that YNDX has lost market share in the Russian search market to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). While this is not particularly good news, it should be noted that YNDX's market share fell just barely from 60.5% to 60.4%. However, if YNDX continues to lose market share, this could quickly become a real issue.Analyst UpgradesYNDX has received a few upgrades recently. On September 21, JP Morgan analyst Alex Kantarovich suggested investors go long YNDX and short another Russian internet company, Mail.Ru Group. The note suggested that ""core shareholder selling in YNDX may be coming to an end."" In addition to the bullish note for JP Morgan, Deutsche Bank and other Wall Street firms have recently reaffirmed their bullish outlook on YNDX.Yandex Has Caught UpIn my previous piece, one of the reasons why I was bullish on YNDX was the fact that it had lagged behind nearly all comparable stocks. Since that time, as shown by the chart below, YNDX has outpaced comparable issues such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), LinkedIn (LNKD), Market Vectors Russia ETF (BATS:RSX), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and kept pace with Google, which has been one of the hottest stocks of late. It is fair to say that YNDX has played catch up with its peers.YNDX data by YChartsThree Reasons Why I Remain Bullish1. The options activity continues to indicate more upside ahead for YNDX.2. I believe the move higher in Google bodes well for YNDX because YNDX is often dubbed ""the Google of Russia.""3. Noted investor Jim Rogers has recently changed his tune on Russia. Rogers had, for the longest time, been very bearish about the outlook for the Russian economy. However, recently he has changed outlook for the country. As someone who has followed Jim Rogers for a long time, simply put, when he speaks investors should listen. If Rogers is correct about Russia as a whole, YNDX should be poised to benefit.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

The company generated more than 63% of all web traffic in Russia in 2011, and had an internet search engine market share of more than 60% by the middle of 2011. Liveinternet.ru estimated that Yandex had approximately a 63.3% share in the Russian search engine market in 2011, compared with Google (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s Russian market share of 23.4% in 2011.(Click to enlarge)Source: comScoreThe most popular services provided by Yandex are Yandex Search, Yandex Homepage, Yandex News Yandex Market, and Yandex Mail. The company derives more than 97% of its revenues from online text based advertising. Display advertising accounts for a small portion of advertising revenues at the moment. The company generates internet advertising revenues from its own websites and websites on third party ad network. The company makes text based ad revenue from charging advertisers on a cost per click (CPC) basis and display advertising on a cost per thousand impression basis.

Net income rose by 53% YOY to RUR 1.3 billion. Yandex expects the 2012 annual revenues to grow by 40-45%. Yandex has a strong balance sheet with zero debt and more than 10 billion in cash plus short term investments. Yandex has generated positive operating cash flows in the past five quarters, sufficient to finance capital expenditures.Future OutlookThe company has a strong foothold in Russia and is taking the most advantage of growth in the Russian Internet Advertising. Furthermore, it is widely used in Central Asian countries as well, and has expanded into Turkey where it is quickly gaining popularity. Alexa, a global web information company, has reported that page views of Yandex Turkey are up 35% in the past three months compared to Google Turkey page views growth of 25% in the same period.CPCs are falling industry wide due to supply demand imbalances, and are expected to fall further. However, companies like Yandex, having a strong grip on regional markets, are experiencing high growth in paid clicks volumes. Therefore, these companies have been able to post impressive revenue growth and will most likely continue the growth trend in future.A strong balance sheet and cash position will provide additional financial flexibility to Yandex in investing in research development and infrastructure, or in making acquisitions.Valuation and Investment RecommendationYandex's shares are currently trading at 16.73x forward earnings compared to Google, which is trading at 11.6x, and Baidu at 18.2x times forward earnings. Furthermore, Reuters reports analysts' consensus long term growth rates of 34.92% for Yandex, 18.66% for Google, and 42.16% for Baidu. These metrics may suggest that Yandex is fairly priced in the market. Nevertheless, we believe that Yandex is more appropriately positioned to take advantage of growth in the Russian Internet Advertising Industry, compared to Google. Plus, Yandex is facing less competition in Russia compared to Baidu in China; Baidu has recently experienced increasing competition from the entrance of new players in the Chinese ad market. We believe, therefore, that Yandex should be priced at an earnings multiple close to or above Baidu, and thus recommend buying the stock. Based on 2013 analyst consensus earnings per share of $1.16 and an implied multiple of 20x, we forecast a target price of $23.20 for Yandex with a 22.75% upside potential.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
1108001,22762,2013-01-11T15:52:10-05:00,,"By Josh ConstineYandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), the  Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) of Russia, has built a voice-activated visual search engine for  Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). Codenamed “Wonder,” the mobile app lets people ask what  businesses friends have visited and what content they’ve consumed,  sources confirm. The question is if Facebook will permit the app. Its  policy prohibits use of its data in search engines without permission,  and Wonder resembles Facebook “Nearby.”I talked to multiple industry sources who’ve seen Wonder first-hand  or currently have a build of it on their iOS device (though an Android  version may have been developed, too). The logo you see at right is my  attempt at an artist rendition of what sources say an early version of  the app’s logo looked like. One source said Wonder is “about more than  Facebook” which means it could pull in more traditional search results,  or just make use of data from the partners I detail below.A Yandex spokesperson said Yandex “can’t confirm and can’t comment”  on Wonder. However, they did admit that “Yandex is working on mining  social data. We are building social products.” It also noted it would  have an announcement to make on that front in the coming weeks or  months, which could certainly be a reveal of Wonder.Here’s a rundown of how an alpha version of Wonder worked, but note  that some design and partnership details may change if it’s released.Wonder users can search using voice for things such as “restaurants  in Los Angeles my friends have visited.” A horizontal, tile-by-tile  scrolling interface lets them view one at a time the restaurants where  their Facebook friends have taken photos or checked in. Wonderers can  also type to search instead of using voice, or ask to see where a  specific friend has gone.Clicking on a business shows a horizontal stream of photos and  recommendations of that place posted by their friends. Another tap  brings up Foursquare-powered venue info such as a map, address, and  phone number.Wonder isn’t just for local businesses like Facebook’s recently launched “Nearby” feature built by the acquired Gowalla team.  Wonder can pull up music that friends have listened to, let you learn  about artists thanks to Last.fm-powered profiles, or preview or buy  songs from iTunes. There’s a news discovery component, too. You can see  news articles recently read by all your friends or a specific friend and  read them within the app through an internal browser.Yandex  has largely limited itself to Russia and Russian-speaking markets over  the years — a market where it is currently the largest search provider.  But its share in its home market has come down and been hovering around  60 percent in the last year with competition from Google and others, so  it is turning to growth elsewhere.Some of projects SPB may have helped Yandex with include apps discovery for music, business listings, taxi services (similar to Uber, with a very popular app in Moscow) and more (this Google Play list  includes apps for movie listings, ecommerce, Yandex’s Dropbox-like app  Yandex.disc, and Yandex.market for ‘personal shopping’ ). In fact, you  could think of these as a composite for some of the features of Wonder.So Wonder sounds great, especially compared to Facebook’s internal  search engine, which is glaringly deficient. There’s no way to search  for news read by friends, searching an artist’s name in the music  category returns zero results, and if you figure out how to use the  Places tab to search for restaurants, you’re met with standard-looking  search results. Finding photos or recommendations of businesses from  your friends is tough. Facebook tried to fix some of this with Nearby,  and did a pretty good job with the business search. Built into a tab in  Facebook’s primary mobile apps, Nearby shows you places friends have  been, Liked, or recommended. It took a browse-by-category approach to  minimizing mobile typing, in contrast to Wonder’s focus on voice  commands. However, Nearby doesn’t surface photos taken by friends at  places yet, and it might be better off as a standalone app rather than  being buried in Facebook for iOS and Android’s navigation.The problem is that Yandex’s Wonder may be a bit too great and employ too much of Facebook’s data. In May, Facebook updated its Platform Policies  to include the statement “You must not include data obtained from us in  any search engine or directory without our written permission.”  Facebook tells me this was designed to keep your friends from  volunteering your private information to public search engines. But  Wonder could definitely be interpreted as a search engine, especially  considering its built by Yandex, and the policy doesn’t only apply to  private data.In  fact, Facebook apparently learned that Yandex was developing Wonder  around the time it changed its policy, and the line could have been  added to protect Facebook’s future endeavors in search from invaders  like Yandex. Therefore, Wonder might get its public Facebook data access  shut down if it doesn’t have permission, and I’ve heard Yandex is  actually worried this will happen pre- or post-launch.Facebook Nearby, since it launched, could answer that sushi question,  but so could Wonder thanks to Facebook’s data. With local business  discovery comes lots of opportunity for monetization through sponsored  placement and other channels. Facebook may not want some other company  cashing in on this.There is hope, though. Facebook struck a status update licensing deal with Yandex in 2010  to allow public posts from Pages to appear in the Russian search  engine. In exchange Facebook got a widget on the Yandex home page that  helped it sign up Russian users when it was still fighting off local  social network VKontakte. Russian news outlet Ria Novosti also reported that Zuckerberg visited Yandex’s headquarters in Moscow in the Fall and held talks with management there.Perhaps Facebook and Yandex could come to some sort of partnership  around Wonder, such as a revenue share or allowing it to use Facebook  data in exchange for more promotion of Facebook on Yandex. Other  possibilities include Facebook buying the app from Yandex, cloning it  the way Facebook copied Snapchat to build Poke, or working out a larger  deal where Yandex assists Facebook with its search strategy. If Facebook  was really feeling generous, it could just give Yandex permission to  use the necessary data in Wonder.Original Post"
1656132,45691,2013-08-26T00:43:32-04:00,,"The Internet information providers industry offers entrepreneurs one of the simplest avenues for starting a business. However, the challenge is always making the investment worthwhile. Even giant companies like Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Yahoo! (YHOO) have found it difficult to monetize their mammoth levels of traffic. Majorities of the success stories in Internet-based businesses come from the U.S, but Europe is not far behind.Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) is the most promising Internet information provider in Europe, and is among the success stories to emanate from the region as far as Internet-based businesses are concerned. Headquartered in Russia, Yandex has managed to see off competition from industry giants like Google and Yahoo, at least from its home country.Strong fundamentals back product developmentIncorporated in the same year by Facebook, Yandex's current revenue potential is nowhere close to the social networking giant's levels. However, the two operate in slightly different sub-industries, and have different targets in terms of market segments. That said, Yandex's performance has been solid and its ratio of cash to revenues is amazing. Yandex sits on a sub $290 million in total cash, while its trailing 12-month revenues stand at just over $1 billion.Additionally, Yandex's balance sheet indicates that the company is free of debt, which means that there is little suppression on operating cash flows. This provides the company with cash to invest in new products, which are vital for growth. Currently, Yandex is available in five versions; the parent Russian version, Belarusian, Turkish, Uzbekistani, and Ukrainian. The company is also aiming to expand its localized versions to other countries, which will need cash.Yandex's main challenger in its home country is Google's Russian version (Google.ru). It ranks third in terms of traffic in the European nation, while Yandex is ranked first based on Alexa rankings. Yandex commands more than 60% share of the Internet search market in Russia, and based on its localized versions of its websites, there is a huge chance that it will stretch its dominance to the former United Soviet Socialist Republic (U.S.S.R) affiliate countries, and more in the eastern Europe.The company also launched two versions of its mobile browsers, one for the android-based smartphones, and another for iPads, during the most recent quarter to cater for android and iPad users. This is strategic because android platform dominates the smartphone industry, while iPads are the most popular tablets in the world.Double-digit growth ratesDuring Q2, Yandex reported 35% growth in revenues, while net income increased by 47% from the same quarter last year, depicting a similar trend experienced in Q1. For the half-year results, revenues grew by 36%, while net income was up 37% year-over-year. The company projected a revenues growth rate of about 34%-38% for the full year, 2013.Traffic acquisition costs (NYSE:TAC) increased by 28% from the same quarter last year. Paid clicks on the other hand, increased by 29%, a percentage point above TAC. On the downside, Yandex's cost per click increased by 5% during the quarter, compared to Google's decline of 6%.The company relies heavily on text-based advertising, accounting for about 88% of the overall revenues, based on results from Q2, while display advertising accounted for 9%. Text-based advertising revenues from Yandex's websites were up 37%, while display ad revenues increased by 31%. Yandex's primary search platform uses a keyword tool similar to Google Adwords, dubbed Yandex.Direct.The company has several platforms designed to accommodate display ads, including the home page, maps and traffic, weather, jobs and mobile among others. Additionally, the company has an e-commerce platform, where users can buy products online, dubbed Market. These are just but a few of its sources of ad and payments revenue.Some of these products are quite similar to what Yahoo offers, that is, weather and Music. The company also has a mail service, which I believe in the future, can be enhanced to some sort of a social platform, thereby improving engagement. The company had earlier this year launched a social app, dubbed wonder, which was instantly blocked by Facebook.Therefore, this is one of the areas the company lags behind, and which it will need to build on. Whilst Facebook stands tall in social media, Yandex may have to follow the way of Google+ and come up with its own social platform. This will also help the company boost the revenue from display ads.Yandex's margins are impressive enough to absorb investment shocksAs noted before, Yandex financial position is strong enough to support investment in new products. Its main cash outflow, other than business expenses, is the share buyback program, whereby it intends to burn out some $12 million in share repurchases. The company has already paid up $4 million based on the most recent quarter results. Does this put strain on the cash? Well, you could say so, but the company's margins are strong enough to allow more capital investments in product development.The company has a gross margin of 76% compared to Google's 57% and Yahoo's 69%. Its operating margin is even better at 34%, while Google's and Yahoo's stand at 24% and 16% respectively. However, Google and Yahoo hold massive amounts of cash compared to what Yandex has in its coffers, and have better cash to annual revenue ratios.Nonetheless, with the company targeting to launch in more countries with its localized search page, there is a huge potential for growth, which could increase revenue potential and earnings.The bottom lineYandex has already done well by launching the two mobile browser platforms for android-based smartphones and iPads. However, this is just one-step into mobility and will need to come up with several customized products to foster growth.Social media is Facebook's business to lose, but without a social platform, Yandex may continue to struggle with display ad revenues. A social platform will be crucial in targeting ads to users.Finally, the company dominates the Russian market. However, it may need to expand to other related countries like Armenia, Poland, Austria and Hungary among others in order to increase its addressable market. This will be aided by the fact that most Eastern European countries value their local languages, and hence cannot effectively make use of Yandex's English version of the search platform.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

430641,24107,2012-03-13T12:39:41-04:00,,"Russian internet technology firm Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) is set to announce earnings next week. Analysts are expecting the search engine giant to report EPS of 15 cents on $190 million in revenues.Yandex dominates the internet search space in Russia with 64% market share. The company maintains a presence in other CIS nations like Belarus and Kazakhstan, and is attempting to enter the fast-growing Turkish market.Russia (BATS:RSX) is already trading at incredibly cheap valuations. Stocks on Moscow’s exchange are trading at only 4 times enterprise value divided by EBITDA, and 5 times when evaluating non-petroleum components. Compared to its emerging market peers trading at 6.5 times EV/EBITDA, Russia is about 40% cheaper. Troika Dialog analyst Anna Lepetukhina feels that Yandex specifically is too cheap, claiming that the company “has excellent prospects and a fast sales-growth rate...(Yandex), right now it is undervalued.”That certainly appears to be true when you compare Yandex to its domestic and foreign peers. Russian e-mail provider Mail.ru trades at 48 times trailing earnings, compared to Yandex at 38.7 times. Analogous Chinese firm Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) trades at 45.8 times trailing earnings. Yandex is down roughly 17% from its initial public offering in May. Given its strong fundamentals and relatively cheap price, investors looking to gain exposure to Russia’s middle class might want give it careful consideration."
824741,24063,2012-08-23T14:46:58-04:00,,"By Matt DoironTiger Cubs Chase Coleman and Rob Citrone respectively manage Tiger Global Management and Discovery Capital Management. These funds recently filed their 13Fs for the second quarter of 2012 and when they did we noticed that Discovery had more than tripled the size of its position in Yandex NV (NASDAQ:YNDX), a Russian search engine. Yandex has also been a major holding of Tiger Global Management for some time. While that fund trimmed its position in the second quarter, it still owned 32 million shares making the $7 billion market cap company the second largest position in Tiger Global's portfolio according to the 13F. The 32 million number was also about ten times larger than Discovery's position (see more stock picks from Tiger Global Management and Discovery Capital Management). As a result, we are taking a closer look at Yandex.Yandex NV IPO'd in May 2011 and has since fallen 46%, though it is currently trading at over $21 per share and briefly dipped below $17 in June. It is up about 7% this year, roughly even with the Russian focused ETF RSX and well below the NASDAQ's performance (Yandex NV is not one of the top holdings of the RSX, which primarily consists of energy, materials, and financial stocks). Recently Yandex's share of the Russian search market has been up: at the beginning of this month it stood at 60.1% and the most recent data gave it 60.7%. This is not a large increase, but it shows that the company's product is gaining support against Google (NASDAQ:GOOG).In its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue growth of 50% and also increased its margin, bringing growth in net income to 76% against the same quarter last year. Investors seem to acknowledge high growth at the company, as its trailing P/E is 32, but sell-side analysts think that the company is being underestimated. According to its projections, Yandex's forward P/E is 19 and its five-year PEG ratio is 0.7. So on a financial basis, we would say that the company is sound (unless there are corporate issues). Of course, the company is highly exposed to the Russian economy and bears macro risk there - we can see that the stock price exhibits a correlation with oil, and if investors are willing to take that commodity risk they may prefer several low-priced companies in the energy sector.According to our data Tiger Global and Discovery were the top two hedge fund holders of the stock at the end of June, but others had smaller positions. Christopher Lord's Criterion Capital had the largest stake of these others, with 2.7 million shares (see more stock picks from Criterion Capital). Standard Pacific Capital and Emerging Sovereign Group - the latter fund also run by a Tiger Cub, Kevin Kenny - also had positions in the stock.Yandex's closest peer would be its competitor Google (though the two only compete on Yandex's home turf - and historically Russians tend to do quite well against invaders). Google's larger size makes achieving similar growth rates difficult, and in its last quarter it ""only"" grew its earnings by 11% compared to a year ago. However, Google is priced more cheaply at 20 times trailing earnings and 14 times forward earnings. Only looking five years out, where Google's PEG is 1, does Yandex start to look like a better buy. Yahoo (YHOO) is more of an Internet portal, and has not been growing recently, but trades fairly cheaply with trailing and forward P/Es of 17 and 13, respectively. We would also compare Yandex to search engines in other developing countries. Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) has an eerily similar valuation profile: trailing P/E of 32, 70% earnings growth in its most recent quarter compared to the previous year, forward P/E of 19, and five-year PEG of 0.7. In this case, take your pick: China or Russia? Our point of view is that Yandex is a buy and in particular could make for an interesting pair trade with RSX. This would cancel out any of the search engine's exposure to oil, freeing investors to invest in domestic energy companies, and over time our expectation is that Yandex will outperform other Russian companies.Disclosure: I am long GOOG.Business relationship disclosure: This article is written by Insider Monkey's writer, Matt Doiron, and edited by Meena Krishnamsetty.

944651,35121,2012-10-24T05:08:53-04:00,,"Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) is the leading internet technology company in Russia, offering the most popular search engine attracting 49  million unique visitors monthly. Branded as the ""Russian Google"", Yandex generates 60.5% of all search traffic in the country, making it Russia's most visited website, more than double the share held by Google (NASDAQ:GOOG). The company offers similar services to Google, including Yandex.News, Yandex.Maps, Yandex.Disk and Yandex.Market, to name a few. The chart below depicts Yandex's share in Russia versus other search engine service providers. images Source: Yandex Investor Presentation, pg.8Yandex was listed on the NASDAQ in May of 2011, proving to be the largest tech IPO of the year. While the company offered shares at $25, enthusiasm spilling over from LinkedIn's IPO one week prior gave shares a 40% boost to roughly $35. At this quote, Yandex sported an $11 billion valuation. The success of LinkedIn's IPO (which saw shares more than double in price in one trading session) may have influenced investors to over value Yandex, assessing the company at 25-times its 2010 revenues. Consequently, Yandex's shares are down 36% from IPO valuation due to unrealized hype surrounding its IPO and reassessments in growth expectations.Since 2007, Yandex revenues have been growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47%. In addition, so far in the first half of 2012, the revenue is up 50% from the same period a year ago. With 72% of revenue coming from text based advertising on their platform, Yandex has achieved current level of profits by focusing on this core competency. Furthermore, the substantial growth experienced thus far shows that Yandex has been defending its market share in its home turf as Google gains ground (as depicted in the chart, above). The company has maintained a market share of around 60% while Google slowly creeps up, overtaking the competition. Just recently, Yandex launched its own internet browser, Yandex.Browser, after Mozilla replaced its Yandex default search with Google. This inevitable action was a response to reinforce Yandex's dominance in the Russian search engine market.Google's latest earnings had the market in an uproar last week as the company missed Wall Street expectations. Profits slipped 20% from the prior year to $2.18 billion mainly from the slower ad revenue growth and losses in the Motorola division. The $12.5 billion Motorola investment weighed down the third quarter earnings as the phone maker experienced a loss of $527 million. This attempt to penetrate the hardware mobile market may prove to be beneficial in the long term for Google as it attempts to challenge Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) innovative products, but will weigh on cash flows in the interim.Google saw a slower increase in its ad revenue, 15% growth, down from 39% a year ago, a figure that has been lagging since mid-2011. Although they sold more ads, the average price paid by web advertisers per click, CPC, was 15% less than a year ago. This decline is driven by the shift towards the cheaper mobile ads, as more users are adapting mobile devices for online browsing.The transition from desktop advertisements has proved to be a challenge for internet companies as advertisements do not work the same on the smaller screened mobile devices. However, marketers are trying to figure out the mobile ad market, given that mobile usage is expected to overtake PC by 2015. The potential for additional profits has presented itself to the internet giants, but their execution to implement this new opportunity will be the determinant for future success.In its second quarter earnings, Yandex has revealed similar concerning trends that caused Google's latest earnings disappointment. Although revenues have been increasing substantially over the last couple of years, it has been fueled by an increase in the number of advertisers. Similar to Google, Yandex has upped the number of advertisers by 34% from 2011 and, as a result, has had a 64% increase in the amount of paid clicks. Nonetheless, the company has been experiencing a decline in their CPC figures (seen in the chart below) meaning the value of each advertisement clicked has gone down. This ongoing decline is a cause of concern for the company as it shows innovation is needed to implement efficient advertising into mobile markets.Source: Yandex Investor Presentation, pg.32Yandex has begun to implement its mobile strategy to have the upper hand in this dynamic market by partnering with non-competing mobile platforms to distribute its services. Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows Phone 8 will be preinstalled with Yandex as the default search engine in Russia. Similarly, Samsung Android smart phones will have Yandex apps preinstalled. This gradual integration into the mobile market is giving Yandex the opportunity to further develop its advertisement technology to take advantage of the shift in consumer trends and stay competitive.According to CEO Arkady Volozh, Yandex does not have any intention to follow Google into the hardware market, as it focuses on the services which established its competitive advantage. At this point in time, the mobile hardware extension would be an unnecessary expenditure of capital for Yandex as the market is already congested with powerful players (like Apple and Samsung) with robust moats and capital resources. Additionally, mobile hardware would require outsourcing, and therefore a large investment, as seen with Google's acquisition of Motorola.From CEO Arkady Volozh (see here):New opportunities are in the form of expansion abroad as Yandex eyes Turkey, Europe's largest and fastest growing web market, as its next target. Currently, the emerging Turkish internet market is being dominated by rival Google, who owns over 90% market share. However, Yandex plans to use its own expertise to grow the existing 1% market share to an ambitious 5% by year's end, as it faces no real competition for the number two spot in the emerging country's search market.Turkey could prove to be a huge opportunity for Yandex as it currently has 46% internet market penetration (i.e. 46% of the population is online) and a $257  million ad market. This ad market is expected to grow to $400  million by 2014. Taking a conservative approach, if Yandex were to own 5% of Turkish market share in 2014, it would increase revenues by $20  million. However, expansion into foreign search markets are easier said than done - just ask Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). The Chinese search giant has struggled with expansion into the Japanese market, posting losses and disappointing gains in market share.It seems Yandex has outgrown the confines of Russia and needs to develop its business abroad for the company to expand. With third quarter earnings coming out next week, annual growth for full year 2012 has been projected to be in the 40-45% range in 2011. These upcoming results are crucial for investors to see where the company is heading with future operations. Will their comparable advertising cost trends result in the same disappointment that Google encountered last week?Particularly, investors should keep an eye on the progress in the Turkish market, ad revenue growth and further integration with mobile ads which will be key indicators of success. That being said, Yandex is a well-positioned company in a growing market that has laid out a promising strategy; now it is time for them to execute on it.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

However, there are now three reasons to consider buying YNDX.Click to enlargeYNDX data by YChartsOptions ActivityOption Monster reported on the high level of bullish options activity recently; more than 4,000 November 21 calls were bought while, at the same time, an equal number of November 26 calls were sold. Volume at both strikes was well above previous open interest. This trade, known as a call spread, will benefit if YNDX moves higher. The trade will maximize its profit if YNDX is above 26 at the time of expiration. The large trade likely represents institutional money. Institutional money is usually smarter, thus worth following. In summary, the recent options activity points to upside ahead for YNDX over the medium term.Catch-UpAs shown by the chart below, YNDX has lagged behind most comparable securities.Click to enlargeYNDX data by YChartsIn terms of the business itself, YNDX is probably closest to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU). Both GOOG and BIDU have outperformed YNDX. Another security worth looking at compared to YNDX is the Russia Index ETF, Market Vectors Russia ETF (BATS:RSX), which has done much better than YNDX. Also, social media stocks, led by Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) have performed better than YNDX. The weak relative performance means that YNDX could be in a position to play catch-up to these securities.Valuation & EarningsYNDX is a solidly profitable company. For the first quarter, YNDX reported a 53% increase in net income to $43 million or $0.15 per share. While YNDX has lost some market share to Google, the results were still very positive. I also believe the declines in the stock have priced in the market share decline of 6% to 59% from 65% of the Russian search market. Currently, YNDX is trading at 33 times trailing earnings, 16 times forward earnings, and at a PEG ratio of just 0.67. These numbers indicate than YNDX is not an expensive stock relative to its growth.ConclusionWhile YNDX has been declining since its IPO, there are now reasons to consider buying the stock. The bullish options activity, weak performance relative to peers, valuation, and earnings momentum are all reasons to consider YNDX.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."
531891,22762,2012-04-26T14:11:28-04:00,,"By Ingrid LundenYandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), Russia's biggest search company, has posted Q1 earnings, with revenues up 51% to $200.3 million, and net income up 53% to $43 million.The results beat analyst expectations: on average analysts expected revenues of $194.64 million, with earnings per share of $0.15 (low $0.13; high $0.16), but other numbers may still give investors pause: Yandex's share of the search market in Russia, its largest market by far, is now at 59 percent against competition from Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and others: last year it was closer to 65 percent.Before today, Yandex had been trading down amid concerns that competitors (mainly Google) were gaining market share on the company in the search advertising market, an area where Yandex in the past had enjoyed a healthy lead. Yesterday saw the share price dip to its lowest point since December 12.Yandex today said that text-based ads still account for 90 percent of its revenues - 5.3 billion rubles ($181 million). Some 73 percent of those were on Yandex's own properties, which now have 179,000 advertisers.Meanwhile, the addition of media powerhouse Rambler to Yandex's ad network helped that business grow revenues by 117 percent. Text-based ads from Yandex's ad network accounted for 17 percent of Yandex's total revenues in the quarter.Yandex has been focusing a lot of its efforts on making sure that it stays on top in the Russian-language market, which includes other CIS nations and still a lot of opportunity for growth - and growing interest for companies like Google. That's in contrast to, for example, European countries where Google has effectively cornered the market for search. Ilya Segalovich, co-founder and CTO, last week called Google's average 97 percent market share across Europe a ""crazy number"" that makes it a challenge to break into that region.More recently Yandex has also been extending its footprint into markets that are less dominated and have some affinity with Russia in economic model - for example, it has this year launched its mapping and navigation products in Turkey. That business is still small, but growing: today Yandex noted that average daily visitors to its sites in Turkey nearly doubled in March compared to January (390,000 versus 200,000).And yesterday, Yandex showed that it was also interested in looking for ways of moving into new markets by way of venture investments: it became the institutional investor to back Seedcamp, the London-based early-stage seed investment fund and mentoring programme for IT companies. Yandex says that its involvement will involve ""sharing knowledge and expertise"" both with Seedcamp and startups and the ability to invest in projects will also let it choose projects for investment. ""Yandex also acquires a small stake in each project supported by Seedcamp,"" the company said in a statement. While it didn't provide the value of its investment, TNW notes that each project on average gets €250,000.There are signs that Yandex could also be looking for a stronger mobile play going forward. That could mean further reach in mobile search - Yandex is reportedly talking to Apple now to become the default search provider on iOS devices in Russia, similar to the deal Yandex already has for Windows Phone and for Samsung's bada feature phones.And it could mean developing a mobile platform of its own, as its competitor Google has done, possibly becoming one of the latest to try its luck building a device based on a forked, customized version of Android. The recent acquisition of mobile software developer SPB Software, Segalovich says, puts Yandex ""Very close to having a full set of mobile services,"" - mail, maps, and search apps among them - ""the only thing missing is the browser.""One of Yandex's local competitors, Mail.ru, is also releasing earnings later today.Original post"
393971,23899,2012-02-27T06:45:32-05:00,,"By David StermanU.S. investors are always in search of ""the next Google (Nasdaq: GOOG),"" hoping to latch on to a stock that can appreciate smartly over many years.In China, they've already had their Google moment. The country's leading search engine provider, Baidu.com (Nasdaq: BIDU) has seen its shares rise from the low teens in early 2009 to a recent $133, valuing the company at more than $45 billion.Now, investors are starting to pay closer attention to Yandex.com (Nasdaq: YNDX), Russia's leading search engine. Fears of falling market share  have pushed its stock down more than 40% since a post-IPO spike last  spring, but those fears increasingly appear misplaced. And the company's  $7 billion market value, though not inconsiderable, still appears to sharply discount the prospects of major growth in the years ahead.Accelerating growthWhile Baidu and Google saw explosive growth right out of the gate,  Yandex needed time to gain traction, finally reaching an inflection  point in the last few years. Sales grew a modest 14% in 2009 to $295  million, but rose 43% in 2010, 60% in 2011, and should rise another 40%  in 2012 and 2013, translating into $1.3 billion in sales. Goldman Sachs  sees that figure hitting $1.7 billion by 2014. (Note: If you look these  numbers up on your own, the current consensus forecasts on Yahoo Finance  are far off the mark, as far as I can tell.)So why is Yandex's growth finally accelerating? Because major Russian  companies are belatedly embracing the Internet as a key part of their  marketing campaigns. Goldman Sachs sees Russian online ad spending  rising 35% in 2012 and 30% in each of the following three years.Make no mistake, Google is a formidable player, even in Russia. The  company's Android smartphones are becoming increasingly popular and are  helping take market share. Investors have been spooked by the fact that  Yandex's market share has fallen from 65.7% last May to 61.8% in  December 2011, according to liveinternet.ru. Google now has roughly 30% of the market.Google took share by making it harder for users of its Android software  to use any other search engine on its Chrome browser. Google relented on  that anti-competitive move about six weeks ago, and Yandex has seen a  modest bounce back in market share in subsequent weeks.That bounce back could also be attributed to a relationship with  Samsung, the leading smartphone seller in Russia. Samsung uses its own  operating system (known as Bada) instead of Google's Android, and the  Yandex search engine is integrated into the system.Samsung projects 50% sales growth for its phones in Russia in 2012. The newly-launched Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT)/Nokia (NYSE: NOK)  Windows phones also use Yandex as a default search engine and could  help boost share if that joint venture's offerings gain traction. In  effect, the Russian market is quickly coalescing between Google in one  camp and Yandex in the other.Goldman Sachs goes so far as to suggest Yandex may soon ink agreements  with wireless service providers to have its software pre-loaded onto  Android phones. What would be Google's response? ""We think Google will  likely allow such a partnership  on its operating system because opposition may raise further anti-trust  investigations against Google,"" note Goldman's analysts.Investors are best off assuming that the recent stabilization in market  share will be the norm in 2012, and Yandex can simply grow in line with  the broader market. That, as noted earlier, should set the stage for 40%  growth in each of the next two years and also help Yandex maintain its  impressive 45% EBITDA  margins. Goldman Sachs sees shares rising from a recent $23 to $30 -- a  30% gain. Deutsche Bank is even more aggressive, with a $38 price target, noting that ""shares of Yandex significantly under-appreciate the secular growth.""Risks to Consider: The Russian economy is thriving in part due to robust oil prices. A pullback in this commodity  might dampen the Russian economy and consumer spending. Moreover,  investors need to track market share trends. If Google resumes its  market share gains seen last summer, then investors should head for the  exits.The U.S. and European Internet penetration rates are nearing a peak,  and China isn't far behind. Russia remains relatively under-penetrated  and should deliver very high growth in the next few years. Yandex.com  remains the best way to play that trend.Disclosure: David Sterman does not personally hold  positions in any securities mentioned in this article.

461941,24405,2012-03-27T18:00:11-04:00,,"It appears Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is in talks with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) to add Baidu as a possible search engine on the next version of iOS. This a wise move for both firms for a number of reasons. The first reason is that it will give Chinese users a more familiar search engine, which will give Chinese consumers an added reason to purchase the iPhone. Keep in mind that Baidu will not be the default search engine, but it would give consumers an option.This is also important for Baidu. If Baidu is added as a possible search engine to the iPhone, then Baidu will gain substantial market share in China because Chinese consumers will be able to search with Baidu at home and on their iPhones. This will in turn cause Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) some concern. Baidu's Chinese market share is 78%, courtesy of Google deciding to stop censoring search results in China back in March 2010. An iPhone option will cause Baidu's revenue and income to increase moving forward. Thus, Baidu is another company that is positively affected by Apple.Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) may be next in line on the Apple profit train. With Apple possibly granting access to Baidu, Apple may add a Yandex option in the future. There a few problems with this idea, though. One is that iPhone sales in Russia are one notch above terrible. Another reason is that Yandex has already created an app.But let me see if these problems can be fixed, beginning with the lagging iPhone sales in Russia. The IDC is forecasting that iOS smartphones will increase about 1% this year. This is a negligible improvement, but it is improvement. The biggest problem stemming from a lack of iPhone sales in Russia is that Apple may not invest any time in creating a Yandex search option if end user demand does not warrant the investment.On the other hand, if Apple gives Russian consumers the option to use Yandex as a programmed search engine, we may see iPhone sales increase substantially in Russia. It may sound like a long shot, but it is a possibility.Since Yandex developed an app, it may seem like there is no need for Apple to create a Yandex option. However, while most consumers may be happy with a simple app, the truth is that convenience is one of the keys to satisfying customers. It would be much more convenient for Russian consumers to have Yandex set as the default search engine and completely bypass clicking on an extra app to surf the web.Even though Apple has a history of neglecting customer satisfaction, excluding the fact that Apple's products are inherently satisfying, Tim Cook is a different man than Steve Jobs. While Steve Jobs wanted to create the largest and most successful business in the world, Tim Cook seems to care more about customers, employees, and supporters of Apple Incorporated. This is a positive sign because it indicates that Cook may be willing to develop a Yandex search engine.Assuming Apple develops a Yandex search option, the share price will increase at a much quicker rate. Yandex has about 60% market share in Russia, and having an iPhone search option will greatly improve this market share. Yandex has been losing market share to Google, courtesy of Android.Investors have seen that any stock related to Apple could be a great investment. Baidu was the most recent candidate of this, on Monday, and Yandex may be next in line. Investors should not expect anything to happen in the near term, but if Russian iPhone sales begin to move higher, the probability of Apple developing a Yandex search option will substantially increase. If that happens, investors will see Yandex's share price move substantially higher.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

Further, the company re-iterated its full year revenue guidance, a move that should inspire confidence among investors about its prospects amidst the political and economic turmoil in Russia.Yandex's Q1 performance was largely unaffected by the Ukraine crisis. However, post the earnings release, the stock is down 15%, including a 10% drop on 25 April 2014, the black Friday when US indices and most of the internet stocks were battered.Yandex Q1 2014 Estimates vs. ActualsAs we had reported earlier, analyst estimates were pegged at: Revenue RUR 10.96 billion ($305 million) EPS - RUR 7.98 ($0.22) a share. The table below shows Yandex's performance for Q1 2014.Source: AmigobullsYandex reported Q1 revenue of RUR 10.88 billion ($305 million), missing the average consensus estimates by about 0.7%. However, due to relative appreciation of the RUR vs USD towards the end of the quarter, Yandex met average dollar denominated estimates of $305 million. On the EPS front, Yandex reported an EPS of RUR 8.56 ($0.24) to beat estimates by about 7.3%.*Apart from estimates, all currency conversions are based on the exchange rate of 35.67 RUR/USD used in Yandex's latest quarterly earnings release.Key Financials & MetricsIn spite of missing revenue estimates marginally, Yandex recorded a healthy Y/Y revenue growth of 36%. On a like-to-like basis, after adjusting for revenue from Yandex-Money in previous quarters, Yandex clocked a Y/Y growth of 39%. Yandex has sold majority stake in Yandex-Money and any revenue from the segment is now reported under other income.Source: AmigobullsProfit margins, though still healthy, came in at their lowest this quarter with operating and net margins at about 25% each. Personnel costs and social taxes which tend to be front-loaded at the beginning of the year squeezed margins, as did an increase in Traffic Acquisition Cost (TAC). Improvements are expected on both counts and profit margins could improve as we progress further into the year.Yandex closed the quarter with a net cash inflow of RUR 2.4 billion ($67.2 million), taking the total of cash and cash equivalents to RUR 51 billion ($1.42 billion).TAC grew by 97% to nearly double again as it did in Q4 2013. However, partner TAC as a percentage of partner revenue declined to 67% from 71% in Q4 2013. Yandex is pushing for further reductions in the TAC it pays out to its partners and expects to see the impact of the same later in the year.At 49% Y/Y growth, paid clicks continued to grow at a healthy rate in Q1 vs 51% growth in Q4. Cost per click continued to decline albeit at a slower rate of 5% Y/Y.Text ads accounted for 92% of total revenue. Growing at 104% Y/Y, text advertising revenue from Yandex's ad network continued to grow at a much faster pace than the 26% Y/Y growth in revenue from text advertising on Yandex's own sites. This was driven by Yandex's tie-up with Mail.ru to power paid searches on the Mail.ru platform.Display ad revenue accounted for 7% of total revenues. Display advertising on Own and Owned (O&O) sites grew 4% vs total display ad-revenue growth of 16%. Revenue from Yandex's display ad-network grew to RUR 76 million ($2.1 million) from RUR 3 million ($84k) in Q1 2014. In total, ad-network revenue has grown to 24% of revenue vs 16% of revenue in Q1 2013.Yandex Market ShareYandex continues to dominate the Russian search market with 61.9% market share.It might be interesting to note that Yandex's market share in Ukraine grew from 28% to 30% in 2014 so far, contrary to fears that an anti-Russia sentiment might dent the company's presence in Ukraine. Yandex also saw growth in its search share on mobile devices to account for an estimated 54%.Yandex introduced multi-currency bidding on its Yandex-Direct ad buying platform to make bidding easier for customers from different countries. While this might seem like an exposure to currency fluctuations, it will give Yandex access to a stronger currency while effectively hedging some portion of its revenue.Future Outlook In A Challenging Environment For YandexAs things stand, the company sees no immediate impact from the macro-economic strains on the Russian economy. During the earnings conference call, the management reported that a recent drop in ad spends by the automobile sector was offset by an increase from the financial sector. Further the company believes that it will be partly shielded from a local slowdown as revenue from foreign clients is growing faster than revenue from local customers.For now the company has maintained its full year revenue guidance of RUR 48.9 - 50.8 billion ($1.37 - 1.42 billion). Further, Yandex expects to see an improvement in profit margins as the year progresses. However, given Russia's tougher macro-economic environment, it expects profit margins to remain between 1 - 3% lower than those seen in 2013.It is also worth noting that the depreciation of the RUR vs. USD has resulted in a gain of RUR 647 million (about $18 million) for Q1 2014.Yandex announced a tie up with Nokia to pre-install Yandex apps like search and its app market. The move could help Yandex improve its search share and presence on mobile platforms.Yandex re-purchased about 1.6 million shares in this quarter to reach a total of 11.6 million out of its authorization of 15 million shares. It is likely that it will continue to buy back its shares in the coming quarters.Yandex ValuationFollowing its earnings release, Yandex's stock price has fallen by 15%, with Friday, 25th April, alone accounting for a 10% fall. Spiraling tensions between Ukraine and Russia have taken a toll on the stock and smothered the positive sentiment that was expected post its recent earnings release.Source: AmigobullsThe fact that Yandex has continued to exhibit healthy growth and profitability is a positive, so is the reiteration of its full year revenue guidance. Amongst the 3 search giants, in terms of growth and profitability, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) leads the pack, followed by Yandex and then Google (GOOGL, GOOGL). Valuing Yandex based on an average (of Google and Baidu) P/E multiple, indicates that it should be priced at about $35 a share, with a 48% potential upside from its current price of $24 a share.Risks from the political and macro-economic environment in Russia continue to be a factor. However, we think Yandex is a great investment for the long term at its current valuations.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

310518,22762,2011-11-28T11:03:37-05:00,,"By Rip EmpsonLast week, Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), one of biggest search and advertising companies in Russia, announced that it would be teaming up with Microsoft, Nokia, HTC and Samsung to become the default search engine on both new and upcoming Windows Phones in Russia. This followed the news last month that Yandex is also set to become the search provider for bada-powered smartphones in Russia and the CIS. It’s been a good last few months for Yandex, as Robin pointed out last week, the company has steadily grown its share of the Russian search market to a point where it now owns 62.7 percent of the market in Q3 2011 — ahead of Google.Today, the Russian search giant has announced another strategic move in its mobile strategy, as it has acquired SPB Software, a developer of mobile software that makes its home in Russia, Taiwan, and Thailand. As for the price, sources close to the deal say that it was set at approximately $38 million.SPB was founded in 1999 and was originally focused on making applications and software for Android and Windows mobile devices, from games to productivity apps, but has since become cross-platform, and today offers a more robust suite of mobile solutions. These products include a mobile wallet, data traffic analytics, games, web TV integration, a mobile UI builder, etc.But, according to Yandex Spokesman Ochir Mandzhikov, what was particularly of interest was the company’s new mobile UI engine for both smartphones and tablets, especially SPB’s “Shell 3D” product, which will be used to integrate Yandex’s cloud services and technologies. This is an important play for Yandex because it allows the company to integrate their search and ad services into a UI which can then be distributed across a multitude of mobile platforms. What’s more, using SPB’s mobile UI builder and toolset, OEMS and brands can customize skins, layout, widgets and 3D animation.For more on SPB, visit them at home, and for more on SPB Shell 3D, check out the video below:Original post"

Setting our screens to search for value stocks that have the  potential to outperform in 2012, Russian internet company Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) pops up.Executive Summary:Yandex provides Internet services throughout the Russian Federation  and beyond. The company operates a search engine under the URL of www.yandex.ru.  Yandex also offers specialized search, personalized and location-based  services — including  access to news, weather, road traffic reports,  personal email and television and movie schedules.Revenues are generated through online advertising, display  advertising and advertising through third-party advertising carriers. In  addition to its headquarters in Moscow, the company runs offices in St.  Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk, Kazan, Odessa, Simferopol, Kiev  and in Palo Alto, California. Yandex is also growing via acquiring key  assets, with its latest acquisition of SPB Software taking place in  November.Overall Valuation: YNDX falls into the business  services industry the use of PEG and P/E ratios are the most appropriate  valuation measures. We do not use the price-to-book ratio since it  likely underestimates this technology-rich company’s book value by  overlooking hidden assets such as intellectual property, and given  positive earnings, the price-to-sales ratio is not as meaningful.  Therefore YNDX seems inexpensive with a PEG value of 1.0604, slightly  below the business services industry median of 1.14, although the PE of  36.8319 is among the highest in the industry.Profitability: Based on gross margin, operating  margin and net margin, YNDX converts a larger percentage of its revenues  to profits than most other companies in the sector. Operating margin is  a solid 35.21%.Yield/Dividend: YNDX does not currently offer a dividend.Wall Street Opinion:  Seven out 13 of the analysts  who cover this YNDX have a buy on the stock while five have holds and  only one has a sell on the stock, providing room for a possible upgrade.  The average analyst’s price target is set at $36.Quick rundown on technicals:YNDX is hovering 28% below its IPO price of  $25, hitting a low of $16.60 on Monday. The last two days have been  very encouraging as yesterday’s price action produced a bullish  engulfing candle stick at the Fibonacci -1.618 extension with price  action today pushing up against the T3 Tilson.The relative strength indicator also appears to moving off the bottom.Traders can look for a break above the trend line for confirmation of  a reversal but should remain vigilant since YNDX is still young in its  trading history, making it difficult to rely solely on technical  analysis.Trade may want to limit and define risk in this security by using a  deep in-the-money option to reap any upside and limit the risk of the  downside.It is also important to note that the stock as well as the options  are thinly traded, but there currently appears to be some interest  around the $25 call strike."
273155,22145,2011-06-03T04:17:03-04:00,,"By Tony D’AltorioThis past week,  another hot technology IPO hit the market with a substantial sizzle. Yandex  N.V. (Nasdaq: YNDX), Russia’s largest online search engine,  debuted with near-record results.The company’s  $1.3-billion IPO was the biggest technology floatation since Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) debuted in 2004. Admittedly, it has very  impressive stats…Yandex controlled 65  percent of all search traffic in Russia, as of  last year. And it brings in more  revenue than any other Russian  internet company.Traders ate up those  details, pushing the company up as much as 144  percent from its original $25.  It hit a high of $61, then settled in  the mid-$30 range at the day’s close.That gave it a  market capitalization over $11 billion…Yandex: The 1st Russian Company on U.S. Exchange Since 2006 Russian companies  don’t get listed on U.S. exchanges on a regular  basis. Yandex marks the first  one to hit the Nasdaq since 2006.But American  investors don’t usually make a beeline for them even  when they do. Most find  Russia’s political climate too messy for their  liking.The government still  plays a large role in the former communist  country. And its 2012 elections –  which pit current President Dmitry  Medvedev against his predecessor and current  prime minister, Vladimir  Putin – might make it messier.Even so, Yandex  retains its appeal by mirroring Silicon Valley  much more than its local  competitors. An associated western banker  even said, “When you walk through the  door, you feel like you aren’t in  Russia anymore.”Yandex capitalized  on that idea heavily ahead of its IPO. It openly  hailed itself as anything but  the typical oligarch-owned,  natural-resource company that dominates Russia’s  corporate landscape.Yandex And the Growing Russian  Internet MarketThe internet market  is growing rapidly in Russia, where it comes second only to Germany in size.Over the next four  years, Moscow-based polling agency Public Opinion Foundation sees a lot of  positive growth in this area.It estimates that  Russia’s internet penetration will increase from  40 percent to 70 percent. And  Russia’s online advertising market will  triple, growing faster than any other  country’s.These factors should  speed up Yandex’s revenue intake even more.Mail.ru is Russia’s  largest email provider. It also owns a major  stake in the country’s biggest  social networking site and owns part of Facebook.Yandex OutlookYandex’s long-term  future raises further worries. Once it does all  it can at home, will it be able  to expand outside of Russia?And government  interference into the internet poses yet another issue…The company recently  received a lot of negative publicity in  complying with government regulations.  To the dismay of many, it  provided authorities with users’ personal information  recorded on its  payment site, Yandex Money.U.S. investors don’t  seem to care about any of that so far, though.  Far from it, since they bid the  stock up to a very rich valuation  level…Right now, Yandex  has an earnings multiple of about 93 times net  income. That trumps Google’s 20  times and the 87 times recorded by China’s Baidu.com (Nasdaq: BIDU).And Google trades at 13 times expected 2012  earnings versus Yandex, which trades at about twice that.That seems a bit too  optimistic, even if the company has great  opportunities ahead of it. Yandex has  a lot to prove in order to live  up to all of that hype.Disclosure: Investment U expressly forbids  its writers from having a financial interest in any security they  recommend to our subscribers.

After taking LinkedIn (LNKD) public in the mid $50s the stock shot up well over $100 before 'coming back to earth' in the high single digits. Despite a roughly doubling of valuation the investment bankers deemed 'fair value' a month earlier, the analysts from these same sordid banks were jumping over each other to throw 'buy' recommendations on the stock. So apparently the valuation matrix changed by a factor of 100% or so within 30 days. Reading some of the valuation metrics for how they justified the buy rating and new price targets for LNKD last week, made for some entertaining fiction.

283132,24671,2011-07-29T13:13:49-04:00,,"Shares of Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX), Russia's largest search engine, took a minor hit after the company revealed it was the subject of an investigation into personal data leaked online. Private text messages and other sensitive documents were allegedly revealed through web searches using the company's site. Although the investigation may cause Yandex to alter where its search indexer pulls content from, here is why investors should not be alarmed.Yandex Did Not Leak Any DataSearch engines such as Yandex or Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) crawl the web constantly looking for new, unindexed content in order to increase search results and keep the results relevant. In this case, MegaFon, Russia's second largest mobile phone carrier, leaked data containing private text message data from customers to the public Internet. Yandex simply picked up on this new data added online and indexed it, allowing it to be found by searchers who knew what to look for. The algorithms Yandex uses to index the data did not have a way to tell this data shouldn't have been online - it simply treated the data as any another document and indexed it as such. Website administrators can place restrictions on the search engine crawlers to prevent data the crawlers find from being indexed. But in this case, MegaFon’s site was missing these restrictions, therefore the root cause of the leak lies with MegaFon. The data should never have been released without protection in the first place.What Are the Potential Damages?The leak is mitigated because full names of the subscribers were never actually released alongside the text messages, and Yandex has cleared all the pages containing the personal texts. The originator of the data, MegaFon, is also launching its own internal investigation alongside that of the Russian government. The outcome of the investigations will likely show that Yandex was not at fault in this situation and that corporations actively storing user-specific data need to be vigilant when protecting it from unauthorized access. The leak will unlikely have a long term affect on Yandex's user base since Google, the second most-used search engine in Russia, has suffered numerous privacy leaks in the past and still manages to enjoy search market dominance worldwide.On July 28th, 2011, Yandex reported a 57% YoY increase in revenue in the second quarter, and is projecting a 55%-60% increase in revenue for full-year 2011. Yandex's growth should continue into 2012 and investors should take advantage of big dips in the share price on news like the above.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

On May 14, the company announced that its initial public offering of 52.2 million American depositary shares was priced at $25 per ADS.-----Yandex plans on offering 57.7 million shares at a range of $20-22. Insiders will be selling 40 million shares in the deal. Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, and Goldman Sachs are leading the deal, Piper Jaffray and Pacific Crest co-managing. Post-IPO, YNDX will have 323.3 million shares outstanding for a market cap of $6.79 billion on a pricing of $21. IPO proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.The two founders will own 49% of YNDX combined post-IPO. Each has agreed to a one year lock-up of their shares.From the prospectus: ""We are the leading internet company in Russia, operating the most popular search engine and the most visited website.""YNDX is a Russian search engine, the largest Internet company in the country, with 64% of the search traffic in Russia; Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) is number 2 at 22%. YNDX's share of the market has grown from 55% in 2008 to 57% in 2009, to 64% in 2010, and to 65% in the first three months of 2011. In March, the YNDX website (yandex.ru) attracted 38.3 million unique visitors. YNDX also operates in Ukraine, Kazajhstan and Belarus.In addition to broad search, YNDX offers local search results in more than 1,400 cities. It also offers specialized search resources including news, shopping, blogs, images and videos, much like Google. YNDX also offers an online payment system at yandex.money.Revenues are derived from online advertising. Currently the bulk of revenues are from text-based advertising, with display advertising making up a smaller amount. YNDX does not utilize any pop-up ads. Much like Google, YNDX also serves ads on third party websites that make up the YNDX ad network. Third party site ads accounted for 12.5% of 2010 ad revenues.In the first quarter of 2011, YNDX served ads from 127,000 advertisers. Just 3% of revenues are from advertisers outside of Russia.Much like the selling points for Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) when it came public, YNDX notes that the Russian economy is expected to grow faster than the global economic rate, and that Russian Internet penetration, while significantly lagging behind developed countries, is expected to grow faster -- leading to the conclusion the Russian online/mobile advertising market looks poised to ""outgrow"" more developed countries.YNDX does serve ads on Facebook.Lest we forget, Russia is not yet a free country. This little tidbit hit the newswires not too long after YNDX filed for this IPO:A cozy relationship with the Russian government means that YNDX has (and one can infer will again) given the government personal information about people who have blogged anti-government rhetoric.Inflation is always an issue in Russia; the annual inflation rate has been 12% in 2008 and 9% in each of 1009 and 2010. 　Financials$1.25 per share in cash post-IPO. Its fourth quarter is seasonally the strongest.In 2010: $440 million, a 43% increase over 2009. 79% gross margins. Strong 40% operating margins. Tax rate appears to be 25% of operating income. Net margins after interest income and taxes of 30%. EPS of $0.42.In 2011: Revenues are on pace to grow strongly yet again. $650 million in revenues, nearly 50% growth from 2010. Easy first quarter 2010 comparables are helping to accelerate the growth rate here. Operating margins look to improve slightly to 41%, net margins of 32%. EPS of $0.64. On a pricing of $21, YNDX would trade 33 X's 2011 estimates.Way too cheap, 33X 2011 estimates with a 50% growth rate and dominant market position in a sector growing swiftly.A quick look at BIDU and YNDX:BIDU: $45 billion market cap. currently trading 22X 2011 revenues and 48X '11 estimates. $5 per share in cash on the books expected to grow revenues 65% in 2012.YNDX: On a pricing of $21, $6.79 billion market cap. Would trade 10X 2011 revenues and 33X 2011 estimates. $1.25 per share in cash post-IPO, with an anticipated 50% 2011 revenue growth rate.ConclusionNow this is what a foreign Internet leader looks like: Strong sector leadership in what should continue to be a fast growing sector going forward. Notably taking market share away from competitors (which include Google) annually the past three years is very impressive. Strong margins and growth, easy recommend in range here. Dominant market leader, everything you look for in an IPO coming at a very reasonable multiple."

271458,23395,2011-05-24T04:19:23-04:00,,"Originally created over 20 years ago by two Russian entrepreneurs,  Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) now operates Russia's leading online search engine with a  dominant 65% share of the country's search traffic. Often called the  ""Google of Russia,"" Yandex uses proprietary search algorithms to  retrieve, aggregate and organic online content on its yandex.ru website.Yandex has filed to raise $1.1 billion in its IPO by offering 52 million  shares (70% insider) at a price range of $20 to $22, though sources  report Yandex is now proposing a range of $24 to $25 due to strong deal  demand. Assuming a share price of $25, Yandex would be valued at $8.4  billion and raise $1.3 billion in gross proceeds, making it the fourth  largest IPO year-to-date (after HCA (NYSE:HCA), Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) and Nielsen (NYSE:NLSN)).The company intends to list  on the NASDAQ on Tuesday under the ticker symbol YNDX. Morgan Stanley,  Deutsche Bank Securities and Goldman, Sachs & Co. are the lead  managers on the deal, which is one of eight scheduled to price on this  week's US IPO calendar.BackgroundAccording to the company  website, Yandex's founders coined the term ""Yandex"" as an acronym for  ""Yet Another Indexer.""  Yandex's roots trace back to 1990, when its  predecessor company Arcadia initially developed its underlying search  technology, which uses advanced analysis of the Russian language to  filter through possible word variations and improve search accuracy.   With backing from Baring Vostok, a Russian private equity firm and  Yandex's largest shareholder with a 19% post-offering stake, the company  has continued to enhance its search technology and introduce parallel  services such as email, e-commerce, maps, news, videos, music, blogs and  online payments.  Its yandex.ru website had over 38 million unique  visitors in March 2011 and was the default homepage for 44% of Russia's  Internet users in late 2010.FinancialsYandex generates most of its  revenue by charging per-click fees for text-based advertising, which  are placed on both owned and third-party network sites.  Last year, it  booked $217 million in EBITDA on $440 million in sales, which increased  43% from $307 million in 2009.  It had 180,000 advertising customers  (+37% from 131,000 in 2009), who use an online auction-based service to  bid on keywords, create ad campaigns, monitor performance and manage  their ad budgets.  Yandex expects further growth to be driven by the  introduction of new features, its mobile platform (currently only 5% of  its search traffic), location-based ad formats and selective  international expansion.RisksThe primary concern for  Yandex is its exposure to political pressure from the Russian  government, which could have unpredictable and adverse effects on the  business.  Additionally, operating margins could decline in the  near-term as the company boosts spending on product development (17% of  sales in 2010) and capital expenditures (18%).  Lastly, though Yandex  has maintained its dominant position over the years thanks to its  technology and early mover advantage, intensifying competition from  Mail.ru (8% share) and Google (22%) remains a long-term risk.OutlookYandex should generate  investor interest as the only US-traded company with pure exposure to  Russia's large and underpenetrated online advertising market, which is  expected to grow from $840 million in 2010 to $2.3 billion by 2013 (40%  CAGR).  Further, the company will likely benefit from positive momentum  generated by LinkedIn's IPO (LNKD), which was extremely well-received when it hit the market last week.   Though political pressure is a concern, strong deal demand suggest  investors are focusing more on Yandex's leading market position, notable  track record and unique exposure to one of the world's fastest growing  Internet populations."
271451,23690,2011-05-24T03:48:55-04:00,,"The ""Google of Russia"" is already showing signs of strong demand and solid aftermarket trading. Yandex (NASDAQ:YNDX) is well established and is benefiting from a market realization that some geographies - like China with Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) and Russia with Yandex - represent differentiated investment opportunities despite the dominance of Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) in countries speaking Romanic languages.In the past year we've seen the rise of Russian internet interests, at first though the aggressive investing of DST in companies like Facebook and then in the IPO of Mail.ru, which was warmly received and now trades at a $7B market capitalization. Russia has always had a strong backbone of scientific knowledge and training in mathematics. This may not have translated into making great automobiles or watches, but the country has found commercial application in internet technologies.Yandex has managed to fend off an attack from Google in its home market of Russia and has been expanding and gaining share in adjacent markets like Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus. Google, however, still has a lead in those three markets. Based on the size of the available market for Yandex and its growth rate, it's safe to say that it will represent the largest single player in the European market and be abel to rival countries like India, China and Brazil.From a competitive standpoint, the two that stand out are Mail.ru from within and Google from outside. Competition is driving an expansion into online shopping, mail, e-commerce, maps and related services to drive more clicks, users and market share. In this area we expect all three firms to have the desire and resources to invest heavily. Russian internet users will enjoy robust new services over the next few years. Yandex hopes to leverage its position in maps and traffic to be a leader in the very small but emerging mobile internet in Russia.The revenue levels, growth and cash flow are all very good. For 2010, revenues grew over 40% to reach $440m, on which the company was able to generate an impressive $133m (30%) in free cash flow. For the March 2011 quarter, top line growth improved further to 65% YoY.So how high is YNDX going to go? We've attached a peer analysis table showing some of the comparable companies. Yandex has better than average growth and is among the highest margin companies in the group. The closest comparable companies, in our opinion, are Mail.ru and Baidu. That would suggest something like a 25x sales number. At $25 Yandex would be trading at just 6x sales, which we don't expect to see. Any price under $50 would be attractive and $100 is not out of the question. imageOne mitigating factor is that the offering size is much larger (8x) than that of LinkedIn (LNKD), which creates less of a supply/demand squeeze. Still, there is solid value in Yandex at $50 or below. There is some political risk in Russia but it hasn't hurt Mail.ru, which is trading at 26x sales. Yandex looks like it may price today and should be a very bright spot in an otherwise dull market.Disclosure: I have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours."

The full IPO calendar includes seven others for a total of $3.25 billion.SUMMARY -- YNDX is the leading Internet company in Russia.FYI: Russia's president, Medvedev, is warning of a new Cold War with the west, which presents an investment risk. However, if Russia drives out Internet competition like China did for the search engine Baidu, then YNDX would benefit.YNDX generated significant recent growth, comparing the March 2011 quarter with the March 2010 quarterVALUATION -- YNDX at the mid-point of the price range is valued between Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and China-based Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU).Annualizing the two quarters ended March 2011 the comparisons are:YNDX Valuation MetricsCONCLUSION -- Russia lacks a credible business legal system and also lacks a commitment to free markets. In addition Russia's president waving the Cold War flag, so it may be prudent to be only a short term investor in YNDX. Sales and earnings increases for the March quarter are impressive.BUSINESS -- YNDX is the leading Internet company in Russia, operating the most popular search engine and the most visited website. In 2010, YNDX generated 64% of all search traffic in Russia and was the largest Russian Internet company by revenue.In March 2011, the yandex.ru website attracted 38.3 million unique visitors.

According to LiveInternet.ru, Google's share of the Russian search market for 2010, based on the search traffic generated, was approximately 22%. This compares with 64% for YNDX's search platform and 8% for Mail.ru's search platform.In addition to its search solutions, Google offers online advertising and information and other search services similar to YNDX's, including services similar to Yandex.Direct and Yandex.Maps.Domestic competitionIn terms of domestic players, the principal competitor is Mail.ru. At the end of 2009, Google and Mail.ru announced a partnership agreement pursuant to which Mail.ru would use Google's search platform and contextual-advertising technology.In early 2010, however, Mail.ru launched its own search platform, though it continues to use Google's ad serving technology for its search results pages. In addition to its proprietary search technology driving its own search service, Mail.ru offers many communication services, including Russia's most popular webmail service.InternationalYNDX also faces competition from the Russian and international websites of Microsoft and Yahoo! (YHOO), and also competes with online advertising networks, such as Google and Begun, which direct text-based advertising on a number of popular Russian websites such as Mail.ru, Rambler and others.Social NetworkingYNDX anticipates that social networking sites, such as Facebook, Vkontakte and Mail.ru's Odnoklassniki and My World services, may become significant competitors for online ad budgets.USE OF PROCEEDS -- Shareholders intend to sell 37 million Class A shares.

This will give the company a market  capitalization of about $8 Billion assuming the stock stays at the  offering price,  which surely it will not.  That said, don't expect a first day  performance like LinkedIn (LNKD) because this is a massive initial  offering.Yandex is selling 15.4 million shares (pocketing $385 million),  while  some of its shareholders are selling an aggregate of roughly 36.8   million shares ($920 million).On $445M in revenue (2010), the company is being priced at IPO at about 18 trailing sales.  That's extremely  rich.  Assuming 60% year over year growth in 2011 (which is probably  aggressive), we'd assume a revenue figure of ~$700M in 2011, which would  offer 11x forward revenue.  Not cheap, but in this market people are  willing to pay almost any price for high growth.Of course, these  figures are at the $25 IPO price, so we'll see how inflated they get in a  few hours.  All that said, compared to a lot of merchandise flying out  of China the past six months, this is a well established company.Disclosure: No positionOriginal post"

The expected price is between $20-22. Yandex's Nasdaq symbol will be YNDX. The IPO will offer YNDX Class A shares. The capital structure will encompass Class B and Class C shares. Class B shares have preferential voting rights. Class C shares will exist to meet regulatory filing requirements.The opportunity to invest in a leading search engine offers both high risks and high returns. U.S. investors and consumers possess keen insight into the massive inroads one search engine can achieve with brilliant employees and a streamlined business model. Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) offers stunning proof of significant revenue growth, high profit margins, a dominant North American search engine market share presence, and a no-holds-barred entry into new growth channels. This includes Google's mobile device Android introduction, video market domination via YouTube, and its highly acclaimed email offerings.CompetitionYandex is competing head-to-head with Google. Yandex closed 2010 with a 64% Russian search engine market share versus Google's 22% Russian search engine market share. Yandex's IPO offers an intriguing opportunity to establish a position in a leading global technology entity. The significant growth prospects are tied directly to business execution. The business model is predominantly advertising, much like the North American Google search engine model. Growth opportunities exist in social network partnerships, enhanced mobile device offerings, and improving its consumer online-payment operations.Yandex has continued to gain Russian search engine market share. In 2008, its market share was 55%. This number has continued to increase to a 65% as of March 2011.FinancialsThe company, for fiscal year ending 2010, earned 44 cents per diluted share. The company will have approximately 320 million shares outstanding post-IPO. The company has been profitable since 1998. The company has a long history as a Russian Internet pioneer and is viewed as the premiere local Russian Internet search market provider.CatalystsAs a local search engine enterprise, Yandex has developed solid distribution partners and an entrenched user base. The IPO provides funding to the company for further corporate initiatives and partner networking. The capital will play a key role in attracting prominent mathematicians and engineers. Human capital is vital to constantly improve the search engine algorithms.The March 31st 2011 quarter provides a glimpse of the significant growth opportunities that await. Yandex had 92,000 advertisers in the first quarter of 2010. This number had increased to 127,000 in the first quarter of 2011. This 38% year-over-year growth in number of advertisers smooths out earnings and revenues going forward.The company does not operate in a vacuum. Google, Facebook, and a myriad of other competitors exist or will exist in the future. Yandex's access to the capital markets is likely to be integral to the firm's continued success. The IPO is led by a stellar joint manager team of Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), Deutsche Bank (NYSE:DB), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The company has a short-history of successful operations. The next chapter in Yandex's story will prove if continued success is in the cards.Disclosure: I am long GOOG."
